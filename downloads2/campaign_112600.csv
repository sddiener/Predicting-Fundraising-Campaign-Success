<h3>The V-Path</h3>
<div>
<p>Welcome to the story of The V-Path (@2014)</p>
<p>The V-Path is speculative fiction. What does this mean to you? It means you are in for an interstellar, dimensional ride of possibility!  The V-Path crosses limitations of linear thinking and steps into circular conceptual storytelling.  It is a compilation of shorter stories that weave into a larger story.  It is deep, profound, abstract, humorous and it lives beyond perceived reality in multi-dimensions, altered consciousness, portals, with energy beings and so much more!    </p>
<p>The stories address real issues that we are struggling with, within our changing world and put an energetic/fantastical perspective to them.  It gives new insight to many areas where we have been stuck or limited.   It engages the mind deeply in the fluid story lines that span lifetimes, go into other worlds, and traverse the limitations of being in a body.  </p>
<p>The V-Path is a profound book with no question.  Its inception came from seeing so many people suffer with the changes in our current world and the hope is, although being fiction, it will be able to tell a new story of creation where the ""victim"" becomes empowered and learns what it means to live with the energies of this world.   </p>

<h3>Below is a sampling from one of the story lines: </h3>
<h3><b>The
V-Path of Ellie</b></h3>
<p>Jeseksha tapped Kevin's vital thread; in doing so,
awoke the lifelike images playing out from one of Kevin’s embodiments. Kevin
opened his eyes and looked around him as his current consciousness was now
awake in a life that he had previously lived. He scanned the room for a mirror to see himself
as he had done before to get some clue as to what he might look like and what
his life was like in this experience. </p>
<p>He spotted a mirror in the hallway that led
out of the room. He began his walk down the hall and quickly he was seeing that
something was wrong. </p>
<p>As he came closer there was no mistaking what was wrong, he
was a girl! </p>
<p>Well, a woman would be more accurate. </p>
<p>“What the ...”  escaped his lips as he closed his eyes to
connect with Jeseksha.</p>
<p>He heard her thunderous laugh before he
could even say a word.  </p>
<p>He then thought firmly saying, “Jeseksha,
this is not funny. I am in the body of a girl. How did this happen?” </p>
<p>Jeseksha laughed for another moment. Then
her fiery eyes lit up. </p>
<p>“Kevin, do you think you are talking to a
‘woman’ right now when speaking to me? Do you think you are really a man?  Your inner consciousness does not have form. We do not have gender, let alone vocal chords.</p>
<p>“Kevin, you have gone in and out of the male
and female form countless times. You have been human and beast, fish and fowl;
all the forms that exist in this realm. Your consciousness has slipped in and
out of form for the experience of doing so; each form a new experience, and
when it was done you moved to another form. </p>
<p>To identify with one gender over another is to not see the wholeness in your own being. You are not split and needing anything to complete you. In your physical being, you are made up of billions of fractals that form your entire body. Each and every fractal is a whole dimensional reflection of the entirety of the Universe. Because of this it is impossible for you to need anything outside of you to complete you. <br/></p>
<p>Kevin is the name given to your current form. When you were born into the world of souls, you were named Jaevon. When you are finished with the form of Kevin, you will again return to the world of souls as Jaevon.  You have existed before
and after and always. You are not bound by the concept of time or the apparent
limitations of being in a body. Just as you exist in a form, simultaneously you
exist and are woven into the fabric of all life in this world while embodied.
This enables a true experience for knowing the self, with entrainment and focus on any element or life form you can know yourself through that form, because that form already exists in you.  You are everything, including male and female energy. </p>
<p>Kevin feeling like everything he knew had been shattered, (because it had), tried to process in his thoughts that he was not Kevin, but Jaevon? He was not a body... Then what was he? He looked toward Jeseksha and was about to speak when she stopped him. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">With the distinct look of “enough”, Jeseksha
pulled her energy back so that further inquiry was not welcome by Jaevon.
Jaevon paused, then redirected his attention to the current embodiment.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He opened his eyes and found himself again
looking in the mirror. He assessed his physical appearance and found himself to
be an attractive female, her chestnut hair pulled back from her light olive skin
and almond shaped green eyes. The complexity of this concept finding himself...uhh,
herself, attractive was awkward and he saw her blush in the mirror.  He thought about what Jeseksha
had said and thought, I am not a man? And, I am not a woman?  I am a Jaevon?  What a trip!   </p>

<p>The Above and Beyond Party is campaigning on one single issue only: the inclusion of a None of the Above option on ballot papers. That's it, no other political bias or ideologies.</p>
<p>This is important because in Sheffield Central, an above average 40% of registered voters did not vote in 2010. Of those that did vote, there was a diversity of votes, including many for the Liberal Democrats who represented a protest against the establishment at the time.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is disillusionment with the parties on offer. Sheffield Central has the highest proportion of students of any constituency in the country and I aim to use my status to represent the frustrations these young voters have.</p>
<p>Currently, non-voters are trapped outside the system and all I want to do is give a voice to those who care about how their society is governed, but are frustrated at the failure of elected politicians to represent their views.</p>
<p>With this £500, I will be eligible to stand and start actively campaigning. I can pick up the votes of people who don't believe any party is worth voting for, but I can also give a better option to those who normally just vote for the least bad option.</p>
<p>I have the chance to make a real impact in a constituency that is fed up with the Labour status quo and angry at the betrayal of the Lib Dems on the issue of tuition fees.</p>
<p>If you've read this far, but are unsure if you're willing to donate to such a brand new project and fund someone with no experience of running for Parliament, then don't feel you have to donate. The issue here is that people should be allowed to express that they feel no candidate is satisfactory and if you agree, then spread the message. Share this page and campaign as widely as possible and maybe there will be others who can spare some money.</p>

<h3>What is Blind Date with a Book Project?</h3>
<p>We wrap gently used books with recycled materials and tag them with clues, so you can go on your very own “blind date” with a book. Aimed to preserve the printed word and revive the love for reading, the “blind date with a book” is the perfect way to explore new genres and give used books a new home.

<h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
<p>I grew up with a passion for reading and have hundreds of printed books in my home. It was disheartening to see local bookstores closing down and my friends getting less and less excited about reading. While I interned at Los Angeles Magazine during my sophomore summer of college, I saw the amount of books that publishers sent for review left untouched in the office. I decided to take them home and create this project to help these books find new owners. Since then, I’ve done three mini sales at USC and have sold out every time! I loved doing this project and I decided to set the goal of expanding it into a small business that helps others. That’s why I need YOUR help!</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>The Game Plan is a fantasy novel that explores the lives of the children of angels and demons as they grow up and deal with their powers on Earth. The main character possesses the only power that no other person in the universe has — controlling the mind. This leaves her struggling to fight everyone who wants her unique power and dealing with the internal conflict of not knowing how to use them at the same time.<br/><br/>My name is Alisha Sehgal and I am the author of The Game Plan. I wrote this book because I have had this idea running through my head for over a decade. Although my main focus in school has always been in STEM, I have never failed to love the arts, especially writing. The plot of this story has grown up with me. It is inspired by the life lessons I have learned and I finally got the courage to write it all out to share with the world.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover themes of gaining confidence in oneself while also being entertained. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to escape from your own struggles but also learn alongside Sam Bleu about the importance of using one’s struggles to become stronger.<br/><br/><strong>THE NOVEL:</strong><br/>The book follows the Bleu family as they navigate their lives as orphans with powers on Earth. Sam Bleu, the youngest of five, possesses a gift of mind control on top of her being fire. This gift comes from their late mother, who was a powerful angel. Her siblings are earth, air, water, and time. Since their father, the devil, left them on Earth, the eldest brother, Keith, has turned evil and is after Sam’s gift. I want to depict, through the thick veil of fantasy, that oftentimes power is what hinders people from doing what they truly want (even though most people seek power their whole lives). The main character spends most of her childhood trying to figure out how to use these powers that nobody knows about while also trying to hide them from the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Every other power in the universe, including time control, is split among multiple people to represent that there is a balance between good and evil (several other elements of my book allude to this concept of balance as well) and that this balance is necessary for existence, despite the havoc evil may create — or is it?<br/><br/>You will love this book if you love unique interpretations of mythology, books about magical powers clashing with the mortal world, and loved the Percy Jackson book series. The Game Plan speaks to young adults and fantasy enthusiasts who want to grapple with confidence and growing up in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that The Game Plan inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does one gain confidence in themselves, and do you need to know how to do something to be confident enough to do it?</li>
<li>How do you find the people who truly have your back, and can those who have their own back ever truly be lonely?</li>
<li>How has society clouded our vision of what’s right with the constant push for gaining power?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing our reasons for self-doubt and what may stop us from reaching our full potential will change us all for the better.</p>
<h3>The Book - <i>The Game Plan</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the author’s note + chapters 1-12. This part of the book is written in Sam Bleu’s perspective. It deals with her initial struggle to understand her own powers and what she needs in life. She lets the people around her dictate much of her life and lacks the confidence needed to explore what is unknown. We get hints of her rebellious side appearing, but ultimately the end of Part 1 acts as the catalyst for her taking control of her own life.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 13-15. This part of the book is written through Logan Green’s perspective. This part of the book deals with understanding how life is more interconnected than people, like Sam, think. We begin to realize that Logan serves as a key role in the fight against our main antagonist and get a sneak peak into the life of another kid struggling with his powers in the mortal world.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 16-17. This part of the book goes back to Sam Bleu’s perspective. We see how she has grown through self-reflection and distancing herself from the multiple voices that previously reigned over her voice.<br/> </p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Alisha Sehgal is a third year Data Science major at UC San Diego. She has been passionate about writing from a young age and despite never pursuing it academically, she has always escaped through this hobby. Through grade school, she won several Reflections awards for her poetry. Now she is pursuing the career of an author through publishing the first book of what she hopes to be another well-known fantasy series like Percy Jackson.<br/><br/>She wants to share the life lessons she has learned through a carefully crafted plot with mythology and social ideals from around the world. She hopes that in reading her novel, people are able to enjoy and escape from their life but also be able to learn from the struggles of the main characters. She especially hopes that the theme of confidence in her novel helps generations to come realize their own self-worth and importance.<br/><br/>Alisha has a bubbly personality and loves to go on adventures around the world. She is often coined as that friend who never says no to a new experience. If you want to try something new, she’s your go-to.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Alisha Sehgal at alishaseh@gmail.com and at ashes__13 on instagram.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>

It deals with her initial struggle to understand her own powers and what she needs in life. She lets the people around her dictate much of her life and lacks the confidence needed to explore what is unknown. We get hints of her rebellious side appearing, but ultimately the end of Part 1 acts as the catalyst for her taking control of her own life.Part 2 contains chapters 13-15. This part of the book is written through Logan Green’s perspective. This part of the book deals with understanding how life is more interconnected than people, like Sam, think. We begin to realize that Logan serves as a key role in the fight against our main antagonist and get a sneak peak into the life of another kid struggling with his powers in the mortal world.Part 3 contains chapters 16-17. This part of the book goes back to Sam Bleu’s perspective. We see how she has grown through self-reflection and distancing herself from the multiple voices that previously reigned over her voice.

You will learn to grow, not only in spite of challenges, but because of them.

You'll also learn from the Dr. Dean Ornish, the world renowned leader in using healthy lifestyles to treat disease, who early in his career struggled with suicidal depression, and turned his life around.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>After reading an unknown name on the gravestone at his grandmothers funeral, Alec finds out about a long kept secret of his family’s dark history. At just eighteen years old, a close relative lost their life at the same time as his uncles passing, but this other mysterious member was kept secret from him. A journey of self-realization and a desperate search for closure sets Alec on a course to the last known location of this mysterious family members whereabouts. He seemingly bites off more than he can chew, when his truck breaks down and a deal to get him back home ends up costing him more time and effort than he knew he would need. Caught between helping those in need that he just met, and making sense of the dark forces plaguing his path Alec struggles to find meaning in his predicament. After he thinks he has found exactly what he needed, who he meets, where he is and what really happens isn’t at all as it had seemed.</p>
<p>My name is Adam Basma and I am the author of <i>There’s a Tale In-between</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to use my background in creative writing and social justice slam poetry to create a story that is both thought provoking and entertaining to any kind of reader. I wish for readers to come away from this book with a refreshed and enlightened energy toward helping those around them and being more involved with their peers. </p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a deeper understanding of the people around you and just how much a persons life is dependent on their surrounding. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to think twice about the decisions you make each day, escape from the fear of losing time and the end of life, and learn alongside the other characters just how helpful it is to believe in others and help them seek a second chance.</p>
<h3>About Setting</h3>
<p>The world of <i>There’s a Tale In-between</i> is just that, a tale. Between life and death lies a tale that everyone has. Now, whether you go through life knowing what your individual story is, or it takes time until your after-life to realize, they are present for all of us. This book spans the journey of a few characters, and challenges the reader to see that in a realistic and normal world, there are lessons and opportunities for growth all around us. Even the most boring town in the middle of nowhere can hold answers to some of the worlds deepest secrets, and hold adventures with some of the most uncanny characters. That is exactly what I hoped to address in this book and exactly what the reader might take away from it. Look around you and realize that every single person walking through the world can bring meaning and change, whether good or bad, to your life that you wouldn’t have experienced had it not been for them. The world of this book is simple, but the characters add a richness and fascination to the importance of just one human connection that I hope will resonate with readers long after the final page.</p>
<h3>Who Will Love This Book</h3>
<p>You will love this book if you appreciate the beauty of life itself and the boundless knowledge and change that can be had from one single human connection. If you are interested in spirituality, where we go after-life and thought provoking ways to think about the world around us this book will help to engage you with those ideas entirely.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<p>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December, 2021.</p>

<p>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</p>
<p>The Copyediting for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</p>
<p>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Fall.</p>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<p>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish and a handwritten thank-you note.</p>
<p>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”).</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>After holding countless sheets of lined paper, cramped hands making their way slowly down the page, I learned very young that I wanted to be a writer. There is something about the art form that allows people to understand and re-read a chapter, line or single word to fully digest what it is that the author wants them to feel. In backing this campaign you will not only help me to reach my ultimate goal of being a published author, but also help me to share my ideas and thought provoking content to those who can benefit from the lessons and relatable stories that are told inside the pages of this novel. </p>

</div></div>","Synopsis
After reading an unknown name on the gravestone at his grandmothers funeral, Alec finds out about a long kept secret of his family’s dark history. At just eighteen years old, a close relative lost their life at the same time as his uncles passing, but this other mysterious member was kept secret from him. A journey of self-realization and a desperate search for closure sets Alec on a course to the last known location of this mysterious family members whereabouts. He seemingly bites off more than he can chew, when his truck breaks down and a deal to get him back home ends up costing him more time and effort than he knew he would need. Caught between helping those in need that he just met, and making sense of the dark forces plaguing his path Alec struggles to find meaning in his predicament. After he thinks he has found exactly what he needed, who he meets, where he is and what really happens isn’t at all as it had seemed.
My name is Adam Basma and I am the author of There’s a Tale In-between. I wrote this book because I wanted to use my background in creative writing and social justice slam poetry to create a story that is both thought provoking and entertaining to any kind of reader. I wish for readers to come away from this book with a refreshed and enlightened energy toward helping those around them and being more involved with their peers. 
My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a deeper understanding of the people around you and just how much a persons life is dependent on their surrounding. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to think twice about the decisions you make each day, escape from the fear of losing time and the end of life, and learn alongside the other characters just how helpful it is to believe in others and help them seek a second chance.
About Setting
The world of There’s a Tale In-between is just that, a tale. Between life and death lies a tale that everyone has. Now, whether you go through life knowing what your individual story is, or it takes time until your after-life to realize, they are present for all of us. This book spans the journey of a few characters, and challenges the reader to see that in a realistic and normal world, there are lessons and opportunities for growth all around us. Even the most boring town in the middle of nowhere can hold answers to some of the worlds deepest secrets, and hold adventures with some of the most uncanny characters. That is exactly what I hoped to address in this book and exactly what the reader might take away from it. Look around you and realize that every single person walking through the world can bring meaning and change, whether good or bad, to your life that you wouldn’t have experienced had it not been for them. The world of this book is simple, but the characters add a richness and fascination to the importance of just one human connection that I hope will resonate with readers long after the final page.
Who Will Love This Book
You will love this book if you appreciate the beauty of life itself and the boundless knowledge and change that can be had from one single human connection. If you are interested in spirituality, where we go after-life and thought provoking ways to think about the world around us this book will help to engage you with those ideas entirely.

What We Need & What You Get

The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December, 2021.
The Cover Design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)

You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.
You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.

The Impact
After holding countless sheets of lined paper, cramped hands making their way slowly down the page, I learned very young that I wanted to be a writer. There is something about the art form that allows people to understand and re-read a chapter, line or single word to fully digest what it is that the author wants them to feel. In backing this campaign you will not only help me to reach my ultimate goal of being a published author, but also help me to share my ideas and thought provoking content to those who can benefit from the lessons and relatable stories that are told inside the pages of this novel.

<p><b>The Story:</b></p><p>In 1968, C.W. “Bill”
Truesdale founded New Rivers Press as an independent publishing house to
provide a voice for new authors. Today, New Rivers Press honors Truesdale’s
tradition with a dual mission: to connect the best new and emerging writers and
storytellers from across Minnesota and the world with eager audiences and to provide
hands-on learning opportunities for students interested in entering the
publishing world after graduation. Our recent titles have won awards for Best Short Story Anthology, Best Short Story Collection, and have been runners up in several contests.</p>
<p>In fall of 2016, New
Rivers Press will be publishing eight new titles, including prose and poetry
from writers from all walks of life, living across the country and around the
world. Our titles are selected as the result of three international
competitions (The American Fiction short story contest and the Many Voices Project
competitions in Poetry and Prose) and through open submissions. We want to
continue providing a platform for the greatest writers of prose and poetry to
share their voices, and we want to expand the support we can provide to our
authors. That’s where you come in.</p>
<p><b>What We Need:</b></p>
<p>An 88 page book of
poetry, after designing the cover and the page layout, printing and shipping
galley review copies, several rounds of edits, advertising, and printing and shipping the final books,
costs around $1,500 dollars. A 300 page book of prose costs approximately $2,500. All
told, the eight books we are publishing will cost about $16,000. In-house ebook production is
$750 ($150 for each of five prose titles). Advertising in a publishing year, for contests, events, conferences, and festivals,
costs about $5,000. Shipping our books to our distributors and to individual
buyers from our office costs about $1,100 a year. We currently pay $1,000 honorariums to
the winners of each of our three contests (and $500 and $250 for second and third place respectively in our short story contest, alongside paying our judges for their hard work and dedication). Altogether, Honorariums account for $6,000. Including Indiegogo fees (projected around $1,650) and the percentage donated to our fiscal agent (about $2,500 to Minnesota State University Moorhead's Alumni Foundation), our total project goal is $33,000.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448686834/nuhu5z6rmf0mjcr1tglk.png"" src="""" style=""width: 483.333px; height: 290px;""/></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What You Get:</b><br/></p>
<p>New Rivers Press wants to
continue providing a place for new and emerging authors’ voices to be heard. We
want to expand our support of those authors, and to do so, we need the support
of our audience. We are looking for a few big-budget donors, but we understand
not everyone has those means, and welcome and appreciate donations of all
sizes. Though MSU Moorhead's Alumni Foundation, New Rivers Press has 501(c)3 non-profit standing, so in addition to the

<p><b>Impact:</b></p><p>New Rivers Press has a
long history of providing a voice to writers from all backgrounds, including
LGBT+ writers, women writers, and writers of color. 2016’s titles include two
writers from the LGBT+ community, an author who survived a serious car crash
that killed his wife and son, and a mother coping with her two-year-old’s
cancer diagnosis. You can help us ensure that these important stories, and
those of other outstanding writers, find an audience. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges:</b></p>
<p>New Rivers Press has been
putting out at least six titles a year almost every year since 1968. While
eight titles is more than we traditionally put out, we have the increased
number of interns and students needed to successfully bring all of our titles
to publication. We have student editors and designers who will be working
tirelessly with our authors over the coming months to produce the best books
possible. </p>

<p></p></div>","The Story:In 1968, C.W. “Bill”
Truesdale founded New Rivers Press as an independent publishing house to
provide a voice for new authors. Today, New Rivers Press honors Truesdale’s
tradition with a dual mission: to connect the best new and emerging writers and
storytellers from across Minnesota and the world with eager audiences and to provide
hands-on learning opportunities for students interested in entering the
publishing world after graduation. Our recent titles have won awards for Best Short Story Anthology, Best Short Story Collection, and have been runners up in several contests.
In fall of 2016, New
Rivers Press will be publishing eight new titles, including prose and poetry
from writers from all walks of life, living across the country and around the
world. Our titles are selected as the result of three international
competitions (The American Fiction short story contest and the Many Voices Project
competitions in Poetry and Prose) and through open submissions. We want to
continue providing a platform for the greatest writers of prose and poetry to
share their voices, and we want to expand the support we can provide to our
authors. That’s where you come in.
What We Need:
An 88 page book of
poetry, after designing the cover and the page layout, printing and shipping
galley review copies, several rounds of edits, advertising, and printing and shipping the final books,
costs around $1,500 dollars. A 300 page book of prose costs approximately $2,500. All
told, the eight books we are publishing will cost about $16,000. In-house ebook production is
$750 ($150 for each of five prose titles). Advertising in a publishing year, for contests, events, conferences, and festivals,
costs about $5,000. Shipping our books to our distributors and to individual
buyers from our office costs about $1,100 a year. We currently pay $1,000 honorariums to
the winners of each of our three contests (and $500 and $250 for second and third place respectively in our short story contest, alongside paying our judges for their hard work and dedication). Altogether, Honorariums account for $6,000. Including Indiegogo fees (projected around $1,650) and the percentage donated to our fiscal agent (about $2,500 to Minnesota State University Moorhead's Alumni Foundation), our total project goal is $33,000.What You Get:
New Rivers Press wants to
continue providing a place for new and emerging authors’ voices to be heard. We
want to expand our support of those authors, and to do so, we need the support
of our audience. We are looking for a few big-budget donors, but we understand
not everyone has those means, and welcome and appreciate donations of all
sizes. Though MSU Moorhead's Alumni Foundation, New Rivers Press has 501(c)3 non-profit standing, so in addition to the

These slightly sketched details are the background of Evan and Rachelle’s love story and they are the frame of a very characteristic historical period when witch hunting was no
longer performed, but not completely abandoned.</span></p><p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Rachelle runs a small herbalist’s shop. The shop is renowned for its
quality, the kindness of its owner and the services rendered. Evan keeps
committing horrible crimes and when he escapes into the woods around London, he
is attacked and injured. The climax of the story focusses on the night Evan is
about to die and takes place in Rachelle’s living room. The man , who can
hardly walk, arrives at her house and when she opens the door, he faints. He is
about to die, but he is not scared; she is there and he has seen her one last time,
he has managed to hear the sound of her voice once again. She is finally his
own, she is imprinted in his soul and no one can take her away from him.</span></p>

much so that he sheds new blood to avenge the blood shed in the past. He has
the black mark of the Order of the Willow impressed on his arm. The Order of
the Willow is a reformatory order, but its members still perform witch hunting.
Evan has been ordered to find Rachelle Ramsey and ascertain her magical skills.
The meeting is actually a fatal one. Now he must forget the woman who made him
the shadow of the man he used to be. He fell for her, but she belongs to
another man. She is the woman he has kidnapped, tortured and kept as a

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Nevertheless, in <i>The Prohibited
Rose</i>, I chose a register which is very careful to the historical period in
which the story is set. I decided that the characters should always talk very
formally to each other, even at the most intimate moments. On the contrary, the

background is only hinted at through little details that help give a frame to

feet. When he looked at his arm and chest, he discovered he had been washed.
Next to his improvised bed, he could see a pewter with the remains of a mush of
aloe, calendula and agrimonia. This too confirmed his idea. Thinking he was
about to die, he had visited her the previous night. He had wanted to see her
for one last time so that he could close his eyes to the eternal sleep, having
her image in his mind and his soul. Rachelle, against all odds, had saved and
looked after him. While he was thinking so, an invisible knot tied around his
heart and the desire to touch her overwhelmed him. He stretched his hand
towards the woman’s head and stroked her soft blond curls gently. She moved,
breathed deeply and woke up. Evan withdrew his hand, as if he had burnt himself
. The woman got afraid and stood up.</span></p>

said – You were sleeping, I must have touched you by mistake. I had not seen you

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“ This writer has developed a very
original idea, I was intrigued by the plot. The cover is fantastic and the
content as well, so that I can appoint 5 very well deserved stars to this work.
The story is really well written. Morgan Cavendish has got a careful and detailed
style, but it is never boring, it is pressing and involves the reader from the
first lines. This is very useful to get into the story which is told really
very well. I would have really liked to read an entire novel about these two
characters, because they enchanted me and I did not want to stop reading about
them. Evan and his strength, his deep love, but even the pain he keeps inside
himself…. I think he has a very captivating personality, the most captivating
one in the story. I could feel him inside me and I have lived his feelings and
his pain together with him. He is a man who has had a tragic past, but he has a
new hope in life. Then there is Rachelle, her courage to face such an absurd
accusation. If I had been in her shoes, I do not how I would have reacted. Can
you love your own executioner? I think so, I think that you absurdly can. Love
goes beyond anything, it is crazy, it is mad, so why should you restrict it? Luckily,
there is a happy ending and I loved it.” <span><i>[Malia Delrai]</i></span></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>“Suspicion and accusation, forgiveness and the promise of a true life,
the promise of love. What is the price of happiness? All this is skilfully
concentrated in Morgan Cavendish’s short novel: <i>The Prohibited Rose</i>. You can lose yourself in the smoky alleys and
dark tiny streets of London with the First Industrial Revolution as a
background and most of all, you can savour the intense and refined taste of a
story that promises a lot and that, we hope, can be developed in a longer
novel. There are all the right premises and they are promising and inviting.
The author basis the whole narrative on a fatal meeting and she does so through
measured grace, attention to the linguistic register and to the setting. She
uses short hints and little details which are always appropriate. The
characters have a depth and such an interesting past that they manage to catch
you immediately, fascinating the readers and involving them in the plot from
the very beginning</span>.”  <i>[Saffron,
Harem’s Book]</i></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>“What strikes immediately about this story is that though short, it is
very complete and allows the reader to get involved immediately, without
feeling the sensation that there is something missing. It is absorbing, there
is action and a pinch of eroticism, which is full of feeling and never vulgar.
All this makes the story very captivating and engaging. Rachelle, the main
character, is a beautiful woman, but unfortunately she is a victim of her time.
She is an expert in herbal properties and this the reason why she is accused of
witchcraft and consequently persecuted by a fanatic group of people who hunt
women out of fear and ignorance. On the other hand, Evan has long tried to hide
the demons of his past looking for redemption and revenge and following bad
companies. In reality, the truth is that all his hatred hides a big pain and
the ability to feel strong and all-absorbing emotions. In my opinion, the
strong point of this story is the choice of the author to focus on a precise
moment, beginning the narration in the middle of things and letting the
characters and the events describe the past. That is why the birth of their
controversial love and their future together appear credible and possible. The
way of writing is elegant, flowing and neat. The linguistic register allows the
reader to get the atmosphere of the period in which the story is set. This
story is recommended to all those who like romance with a bit of eroticism, but
who want feelings as well.</span> ” <i>[Deb, Leggendo Romance]</i></p>

reformatory order that still uses unlawful rituals and that provided him with
the tools and the strength to quench his hatred and his thirst for revenge,
though in a devious way?
In just about sixty pages, I have tried to summarise the lives of two
complex characters and, at the same time, I have attempted to give as many
details as possible. I have talked about revenge, jealousy, anger and desire
mingling them with suspicion, blame and forgiveness to get, in the end, to the
promise of a pure love and a true life. However, you cannot achieve happiness
without giving something back… and what price will Evan and Rachelle have to pay
for it?

London, 1815.  The Industrial Revolution is in full swing. The war between Great Britain and America had just finished and the Treaty of Gand was becoming law. These slightly sketched details are the background of Evan and Rachelle’s love story and they are the frame of a very characteristic historical period when witch hunting was no
longer performed, but not completely abandoned.
Rachelle runs a small herbalist’s shop. The shop is renowned for its
quality, the kindness of its owner and the services rendered. Evan keeps
committing horrible crimes and when he escapes into the woods around London, he
is attacked and injured. The climax of the story focusses on the night Evan is
about to die and takes place in Rachelle’s living room. The man , who can
hardly walk, arrives at her house and when she opens the door, he faints. He is
about to die, but he is not scared; she is there and he has seen her one last time,
he has managed to hear the sound of her voice once again. She is finally his
own, she is imprinted in his soul and no one can take her away from him.

Evan Beauchamp is impulsive, determined, intense and capable of extreme
actions. He becomes an orphan when he is a young child and grows up full of
hatred and resentment. As an adult, he is consumed by the desire of revenge so
much so that he sheds new blood to avenge the blood shed in the past. He has
the black mark of the Order of the Willow impressed on his arm. The Order of
the Willow is a reformatory order, but its members still perform witch hunting.
Evan has been ordered to find Rachelle Ramsey and ascertain her magical skills.
The meeting is actually a fatal one. Now he must forget the woman who made him
the shadow of the man he used to be. He fell for her, but she belongs to
another man. She is the woman he has kidnapped, tortured and kept as a
prisoner.
Rachelle Ramsey is an extraordinary woman and Evan cannot forget her. Her
independent and proud spirit allowed her to stand up after she had been
violated and humiliated. She has to fight an even worse battle now, she has to
fight against superstition and ignorance. She knows that that mysterious and
fascinating man saved her life, but she does not know if she can trust him
completely. Terrible memories of her kidnapping come back to her mind and she
is afraid Evan wants to finish his cruel mission.


Usually I am defined as an elegant and precise writer, but maybe I am a
bit too refined in the use of a specific terminology. I do not know if this is
a virtue or a weakness, especially because I do not really know how much my style
can be appreciated by the reader.
Nevertheless, in The Prohibited
Rose, I chose a register which is very careful to the historical period in
which the story is set. I decided that the characters should always talk very
formally to each other, even at the most intimate moments. On the contrary, the
narration is simpler, without redundancy and excesses. The historical
background is only hinted at through little details that help give a frame to
the sequence of events. All in all, I think I have done a good job.

He immediately recognised Rachelle in the small female shape at his
feet. When he looked at his arm and chest, he discovered he had been washed.
Next to his improvised bed, he could see a pewter with the remains of a mush of
aloe, calendula and agrimonia. This too confirmed his idea. Thinking he was
about to die, he had visited her the previous night. He had wanted to see her
for one last time so that he could close his eyes to the eternal sleep, having
her image in his mind and his soul. Rachelle, against all odds, had saved and
looked after him. While he was thinking so, an invisible knot tied around his
heart and the desire to touch her overwhelmed him. He stretched his hand
towards the woman’s head and stroked her soft blond curls gently. She moved,
breathed deeply and woke up. Evan withdrew his hand, as if he had burnt himself
. The woman got afraid and stood up.
– I did not mean to hurt you, Madame – he promptly
said – You were sleeping, I must have touched you by mistake. I had not seen you
down there… - he lied, looking away.
– Forgive me, Mr Beauchamp, I fell asleep while I
should have kept awake and take care of you – she apologised and left him
speechless.
– Rachelle, you looked after me and this
means a lot – he said briefly. He moved and spoke again – I have already
disturbed you enough… – he added and he tried to stand up as well.
– You are injured, Sir... you cannot leave
– Rachelle replied and she leaned her hand on his to stop him. 


“ This writer has developed a very
original idea, I was intrigued by the plot. The cover is fantastic and the
content as well, so that I can appoint 5 very well deserved stars to this work.
The story is really well written. Morgan Cavendish has got a careful and detailed
style, but it is never boring, it is pressing and involves the reader from the
first lines. This is very useful to get into the story which is told really
very well. I would have really liked to read an entire novel about these two
characters, because they enchanted me and I did not want to stop reading about
them. Evan and his strength, his deep love, but even the pain he keeps inside
himself…. I think he has a very captivating personality, the most captivating
one in the story. I could feel him inside me and I have lived his feelings and
his pain together with him. He is a man who has had a tragic past, but he has a
new hope in life. Then there is Rachelle, her courage to face such an absurd
accusation. If I had been in her shoes, I do not how I would have reacted. Can
you love your own executioner? I think so, I think that you absurdly can. Love
goes beyond anything, it is crazy, it is mad, so why should you restrict it? Luckily,
there is a happy ending and I loved it.” [Malia Delrai]

“Suspicion and accusation, forgiveness and the promise of a true life,
the promise of love. What is the price of happiness? All this is skilfully
concentrated in Morgan Cavendish’s short novel: The Prohibited Rose. You can lose yourself in the smoky alleys and
dark tiny streets of London with the First Industrial Revolution as a
background and most of all, you can savour the intense and refined taste of a
story that promises a lot and that, we hope, can be developed in a longer
novel. There are all the right premises and they are promising and inviting.
The author basis the whole narrative on a fatal meeting and she does so through
measured grace, attention to the linguistic register and to the setting. She
uses short hints and little details which are always appropriate. The
characters have a depth and such an interesting past that they manage to catch
you immediately, fascinating the readers and involving them in the plot from
the very beginning.”  [Saffron,
Harem’s Book]

“What strikes immediately about this story is that though short, it is
very complete and allows the reader to get involved immediately, without
feeling the sensation that there is something missing. It is absorbing, there
is action and a pinch of eroticism, which is full of feeling and never vulgar.
All this makes the story very captivating and engaging. Rachelle, the main
character, is a beautiful woman, but unfortunately she is a victim of her time.
She is an expert in herbal properties and this the reason why she is accused of
witchcraft and consequently persecuted by a fanatic group of people who hunt
women out of fear and ignorance. On the other hand, Evan has long tried to hide
the demons of his past looking for redemption and revenge and following bad
companies. In reality, the truth is that all his hatred hides a big pain and
the ability to feel strong and all-absorbing emotions. In my opinion, the
strong point of this story is the choice of the author to focus on a precise
moment, beginning the narration in the middle of things and letting the
characters and the events describe the past. That is why the birth of their
controversial love and their future together appear credible and possible. The
way of writing is elegant, flowing and neat. The linguistic register allows the
reader to get the atmosphere of the period in which the story is set. This
story is recommended to all those who like romance with a bit of eroticism, but
who want feelings as well. ” [Deb, Leggendo Romance]

As I have already said before, I would
like to translate this short novel into English so that Americans, British, Australians
and all who know this beautiful language can read and appreciate it. I need
about 2500 euros to pay a good translation agency to work on my project. Will
you help me  reach the budget I need?
Thank you in advance...

<h3>
<em>Lincoln</em> <em>Raw</em><strong></strong>, a novel by bestselling author DL Fowler, gets inside Abraham Lincoln's heart and head for a close up view of how his passions grew and erupted to the surface to change the course of a nation.</h3>
<h3>Narrating in Lincoln's first person storyteller voice, Fowler aims to paint a complete picture of the real Lincoln and make him more approachable for readers -- especially for a generation who weren't even born when most Lincoln biograpies were written. </h3>
<p>As we draw closer to the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's assassination, people from both ends of the political spectrum insist America is at a crossroads. Our country was at a similar place in Lincoln's day, and he stood in the middle of that intersection.</p>
<p>His vision of 'a new declaration of liberty for all' profoundly changed the course of history. Yet that declaration invaded the national consciousness only because he was driven by intense emotions which he dressed in reason and articulated with skill. We cannot fully understand the America he hoped for without touching the emotions that propelled him. <em><strong>Lincoln Raw</strong></em><strong> </strong>helps us make that connection.</p>
<p>The idea of Lincoln the vampire hunter has amused many people - but Grahame-Smith's novel more accurately illustrates the emotional foundation of Lincoln's life choices than most non-fiction books reveal. Lincoln's obsession with ending slavery actually was connected to his mother's death and his resentment toward the person he held responsible. It's just that vampires weren't involved.</p>
<p>Now you don't have to take my word for how good this project is. Check it out for yourself. If you don't think it's pretty special stuff, don't contribute.</p>

</div></div>","This book is important because it takes Lincoln out of the box and gives us a better understanding of the emotions that drove him and his vision for America.
Follow this link to read a sample chapter. 

Lincoln Raw, a novel by bestselling author DL Fowler, gets inside Abraham Lincoln's heart and head for a close up view of how his passions grew and erupted to the surface to change the course of a nation.
Narrating in Lincoln's first person storyteller voice, Fowler aims to paint a complete picture of the real Lincoln and make him more approachable for readers -- especially for a generation who weren't even born when most Lincoln biograpies were written. 
As we draw closer to the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's assassination, people from both ends of the political spectrum insist America is at a crossroads. Our country was at a similar place in Lincoln's day, and he stood in the middle of that intersection.
His vision of 'a new declaration of liberty for all' profoundly changed the course of history. Yet that declaration invaded the national consciousness only because he was driven by intense emotions which he dressed in reason and articulated with skill. We cannot fully understand the America he hoped for without touching the emotions that propelled him. Lincoln Raw helps us make that connection.
The idea of Lincoln the vampire hunter has amused many people - but Grahame-Smith's novel more accurately illustrates the emotional foundation of Lincoln's life choices than most non-fiction books reveal. Lincoln's obsession with ending slavery actually was connected to his mother's death and his resentment toward the person he held responsible. It's just that vampires weren't involved.
Now you don't have to take my word for how good this project is. Check it out for yourself. If you don't think it's pretty special stuff, don't contribute.

Here's what Lincoln Raw will entail

Sifting through the full historical record, including stories told by the people he grew up with
Retracing his steps and getting a flavor of the surroundings that influenced him
Finding patterns and themes in his philosophies, writings, behavior and relationships to see how his guiding principles evolved
Tracing the origins of his emotions and plumbing their depths to understand how they influenced his principles
Telling Lincoln's story in first person with him as narrator
Since Lincoln isn't around to tell the story, we'll have to find the right words to put in his mouth. Words that are honest and true to his character and personality.
Here's the Deal
We need your help to raise $3,500 for research, professional editing, formatting and production of eBook and paperback editions, as well as designing the cover. Oh yes, and we have to pay for your perks, too.

<em>Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.<br/></em>(Carl Edward Sagan)</h3>

<h2><em><strong>Who is Abraham Ulrikab? </strong></em></h2>
<p><img alt=""Abraham and his family"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.polarhorizons.com/Indiegogo/Abraham_family_sepia.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 0px 10px;"" title=""Abraham and his family""/>In August 1880, two « Eskimo » families from Labrador voluntarily departed for Europe where they were to become the newest exotic attraction in zoos. Abraham Ulrikab was part of the group. Aged from 13 months to 50 years old, the eight individuals were recruited by Johan Adrian Jacobsen on behalf of Carl Hagenbeck, pioneer of ethnographic shows (known today as « human zoos <span class=""notranslate"">»</span>). Since 1874, crowds had been flocking to Hagenbeck’s shows where they could observe « savages <span class=""notranslate"">»</span> originating from different parts of the world. Hagenbeck was hoping to repeat the 1877 success of a group of Greenland « eskimos <span class=""notranslate"">»</span>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a mandatory measure, by German law, was not taken: vaccinate them against smallpox. A deadly mistake. Less than four months after their arrival on European soil, the group no longer existed, having been all killed by smallpox. Three died in Germany. The remaining five, including Abraham, died in Paris.</p>
<h2>What is Abraham's story?</h2>
<p>The following AV show was prepared to introduce the eight Inuit and to provide a summary of their story. Take a moment to meet Abraham, his family and companions, and to admire the majesty of their homeland, Nunatsiavut.</p>

<h2><strong>What is this research looking for?</strong></h2>
<p>Literate, Abraham documented his moods and emotions in his personal diary and in letters. Abraham’s writings give us insight on what happened when the group was exhibited in Germany and in Prague.

<p>These Inuit could not simply have vanished! They must have left traces. What was the sequence of events from the time they arrived in Paris to the time they died? Where are their traces? Where were the Inuit buried?</p>
<p>Those are the questions the project « In the footsteps of Abraham Ulrikab » is trying to answer.</p>
<p>I have been researching this story since 2010. The more I dig, the more riveting the story becomes. My two week stay in Paris in the fall of 2011 proved beyond a doubt that my efforts are not being spent in vain. A fascinating chapter is to be appended to the story.</p>
<p>By supporting this project, you will join the « Friends of Abraham » team and you will witness this search. You will be sitting in the front row and will feel the thrill and excitement of watching the unveiling of a new chapter of this tragic story.</p>

The « In the footsteps of Abraham Ulrikab » research project thanks you!</a></p>
<h2><strong>What has been published to date about the Abraham Ulrikab story</strong></h2>
<p>Abraham Ulrikab’s story may ring a bell for some of you as it has already been the subject of a few publications. The main ones being:</p>
<ul>
<li>The article published in <em>Canadian Geographic in 1981 by </em>Canadian ethnologist James Garth Taylor, who uncovered a copy of a German translation of Abraham’s diary and revealed the tragic story to the 20th century public.</li>
<li>Articles published (in German &amp; English) by German ethnologist Hilke Thode-Arora who conducted further research in archives.</li>
<li>In 2005, Abraham’s diary was translated into English by German Professor Hartmut Lutz and his students from the University of Greifswald, in Germany, and published in the book <em>The Diary of Abraham Ulrikab: Text and Context</em>. It was followed by a German version in 2007.</li>
</ul><p>Here is a statement received from Professor Lutz:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>When my students and I worked on translating, supplementing and editing Abraham’s Diary, we did so mainly with two things in mind. On the one hand, we felt that this sad and shameful story of racism and inhuman callousness needed to be told, and we were very much aware of our German recent history and the legacy of the Holocaust--a legacy we all felt that needs to be remembered and addressed continuously, so that we can learn from the past and not become guilty again. </em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>On the other hand, we had strong hopes that our translation and the supplementary materials we found would be read widely in  Canada, and particularly in the Arctic, so that perhaps some of Abraham’s, Ulrike’s, Terrianiniak’s and Paingo’s relatives in Labrador would learn more about the tragic events over a hundred years ago. We were delighted to learn that indeed an Inuk whose family originates from Hebron and wears the same name as Noggasak, the first Inuk to die in Europe in 1880, has read the book and has returned the text to Hebron. We are now deeply grateful to hear that France Rivet is working on a French translation with additional findings about what befell the Inuit families in France, and we fully support all her efforts. – Maybe, one day there will also be a translation into Inuktitut, and then Abraham’s Diary will truly have returned home.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Why this research matters</strong></h2>
<p>I have been donating my time and money to this research for more than two years and I’ll keep working at it for as long as it takes. The reason? Because I am convinced that my research will allow today’s Labrador Inuit (and Inuit throughout the circumpolar world) to <strong>regain part of the dignity that was taken from their predecessors</strong>.</p>
<p><span id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">I invite you to</span> <span class=""hps"">join the</span> « <span class=""hps"">Friends</span> <span class=""hps"">of Abraham </span>» <span class=""hps"">if, like me,</span> <span class=""hps"">you believe that:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">We owe it to Abraham, Ulrike, Terrianiak, Paingo, Tobias, Noggasak, Sara and Maria <strong>to ensure that their deaths did not occur in vain</strong>. All they wanted was to improve their basic living conditions upon their return. On European soil, the eight Inuit entertained the crowds, enabled entrepreneurs to pocket profits and agreed to be studied by anthropologists who were most happy to have at their disposal “savages” originating from such faraway lands. They paid the ultimate price. </span></span></li>
<li>
<strong>U</strong><span lang=""en""><span class=""hps""><strong>ncovering and telling the whole story is the least we can do for them</strong>.</span></span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>A wait period of 132 year is long enough</strong>. <span id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">It is therefore</span> <span class=""hps"">high time to</span> <span class=""hps"">solve the mysteries</span> <span class=""hps"">that</span> <span class=""hps"">still</span> <span class=""hps"">hover</span> <span class=""hps"">and to make this n</span><span class=""hps"">ew chapter known.</span></span>
</li>
</ul><p class=""Body"">The purpose of this research is not to judge people’s actions of the past or to put blame on what, today, we consider as being wrong doing. I simply want to document the events in an accurate and respectful manner so that this tragic story can finally come to a close.</p>
<h2><strong>What are the project deliverables? <br/></strong></h2>
<h3>
<strong>Publication of the ebook « I am Abraham, Ulrike’s husband » </strong>(target date: May 2013)</h3>
<p><img alt=""Cover first ebook"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.polarhorizons.com/Indiegogo/Couverture_ebook1_EN_200px.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 20px 10px;"" title=""Cover first ebook""/>Abraham Ulrikab’s story having never been published in French, I must ensure that Parisians and France’s population have access to the story, as it is currently known, before the details of the events that took place on their territory are released.</p>
<p>Therefore, before heading to Paris, I will publish a book (in PDF format) which will include Abraham’s own words (his diary and letters) as well as give a general overview of the story.</p>
<p>The purpose of this digital book is therefore to set the stage for the rest of the project. So that as many « Friends of Abraham » as possible have access to this deliverable, it will be available in French and English. Thanks to the generosity of Professor Hartmut Lutz, the English translations of Abraham’s diary and letters produced by him and his students will be reproduced in the English version of this book.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Research in Paris</strong> (Target date : June 2013)</h3>
<p><img alt=""Paris"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.polarhorizons.com/Indiegogo/Paris_400px.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 10px;"" title=""Paris""/>During this research trip to Paris, as a « Friend of Abraham » you will receive at least one update report per week.  In Paris, I will be accompanied by a videographer. Photographs and videoclips will be used to inform you of our progress, the sites we’ve visited, the people we’ve met, the facts we have uncovered, etc. You will feel the excitement of being the first ones to know about what happened to Abraham and his family.</p>
<p>All update reports will be available in French and English and will be exclusive to the «Friends of Abraham».</p>
<h3>
<strong>Publication of the ebook « In the footsteps of Abraham Ulrikab – Paris »</strong> (Target date : November 2013)</h3>
<p>Once I have returned from Paris, I will write a second ebook « In the footsteps of Abraham Ulrikab - Paris »  telling the story of this research project and revealing the discoveries from Paris.  </p>
<p>While the ebook is being written, « Friends of Abraham » will continue to receive exclusive update reports (available in French and English).</p>

<h2><strong>How will the funds be used?</strong></h2>
<p>The funds are needed to cover the following costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>the translations of Abraham’s diary &amp; letters (German to French), of documents uncovered in Paris and of the two ebooks (from French to English);</li>
<li>the production of the two ebooks (including cover design, layout, editing, …),</li>
<li>the acquisition of historical photographs;</li>
<li>the collaboration of specialists (scientists, anthropologists, ethnologists, …) to help with the writing and/or the validation of some sections of the second ebook;</li>
<li>the airfare (Ottawa-Paris) for the researcher and a videographer,</li>
<li>living expenses, transportation and other expenses incurred during the 3 week research trip to Paris for the researcher and the videographer;</li>
<li>Provide an honorarium payment for those who have helped this crowdfunding project happen: the photographers + the composer of the original soundtrack used in the AV show;</li>
<li>The production and mailing of rewards.</li>
</ul><h3 style=""margin-left: 90px;""><strong>What if there is over-financing?</strong></h3>
<p>If so many people feel compelled to become a « Friend of Abraham » and the initial financial goal is exceeded, here are a few activities that are currently on the project's « to-do » list and/or ways that the extra money could be used. Once the campaign is over and the total amount raised is known, we will analyze the different options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look into the production of a printed version of the book « In the footsteps of Abraham Ulrikab – Paris ».</li>
<li>Extend the stay in Paris, if need be.</li>
<li>Head to Hamburg in order to conduct research in archives we believe may very well hold the key to some of the mysteries surrounding the Paris events.</li>
<li class=""hps"">
<span class=""short_text"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">Financially reward the</span> <span class=""hps"">videographer</span> and project assistant <span class=""hps"">who</span> will both be <span class=""hps"">working</span> very <span class=""hps"">hard in the coming months</span></span>.</li>
<li>Produce a documentary out of the collection of videos we will have brought back from Paris to <span id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">tell the story of</span> <span class=""hps"">this research project.</span></span>
</li>
<li>Plan a trip to Nunatsiavut and work with the Torngâsok Cultural Center to meet with the Inuit community in order to hear and document their feelings, thoughts, and concerns about the facts uncovered in Paris. Take the opportunity to meet with Inuit elders who still remember their parents or grand-parents telling them the story of Abraham.</li>
<li>Conduct research to try to identify if there are any living descendants of the two families who died in Europe. We’re still looking for Abraham’s original diary in Inuktitut! Could it be hidden in the attic of a family member’s descendant?</li>

<h2><strong>Who am I?</strong></h2>
<p>An IT consultant for more than 23 years, in 2007 I did a major career change and founded Polar Horizons. For the past six years, I have been dedicating my time and skills as a photographer, freelance writer, educator and researcher to showing the beauties of the Arctic to children and the general public. Several of my texts and photos have been published in Quebec newspapers and magazines. Recently, my writing and/or photographs have appeared in <em>Above and Beyond</em> (First Air’s inflight magazine), <em>Makivik</em> magazine and a Reader’s Digest hardcover book.</p>
<p>Hearing about the Abraham Ulrikab story woke up another passion of mine: archival research (I conducted genealogical research for more than 30 years). Since 2010, I have taken it upon myself to go out and uncover what happened in Paris in 1881. I have established relationships with most of the previous actors who researched Abraham’s story, with institutions in Paris as well as with the Culture, Recreation and Tourism department of the government of Nunatsiavut. I am working in close relationship with all of them. I am fully dedicated to this research and to ensuring that this tragic story can finally come to a close. The Labrador Inuit deserve to know what happened.</p>

<strong>If you remember seeing <strong>photographs or any documents relating to these eight Inuit</strong> in your family's photo albums or archives,</strong> <a href=""http://polarhorizons.com/en/contact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">please get in touch with me</a>.  We know that Abraham has signed many autographs for the crowd who came to see them. Wouldn't it be wonderful to retrace a document holding his original signature?</li>
</ul><p>Whatever way you decide to contribute, your interest, help and support will be most appreaciated. Thank you so much for taking the time to read and consider my proposal.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to share this fascinating story with you!</p>

<h2>Qui est Abraham Ulrikab?</h2>
<p><img alt=""Abraham and his family"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.polarhorizons.com/Indiegogo/Abraham_family_sepia.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 20px 10px;"" title=""Abraham and his family""/>En août 1880, deux familles « esquimaudes » quittent volontairement le Labrador pour l’Europe afin de devenir la plus récente attraction exotique de jardins zoologiques. Abraham Ulrikab fait partie du groupe. Âgés de 13 mois à 50 ans, les huit individus ont été recrutés par Johan Adrian Jacobsen pour le compte de Carl Hagenbeck, pionnier des spectacles ethnographiques (connus aujourd'hui sous le terme « zoos humains »). Depuis 1874, ces spectacles attirent les foules curieuses d’observer des «sauvages» provenant de divers coins de la planète. Avec l’embauche de ces « esquimaux », Hagenbeck espère répéter le succès obtenu en 1877 par un groupe du Groenland.</p>
<p>Toutefois, cette fois-ci, une mesure imposée par la loi allemande n'est pas prise, celle de les vacciner contre la variole. Une erreur fatale. Moins de quatre mois après son arrivée en sol européen, le groupe n’existe plus, tous ayant été emportés par la variole. Trois meurent en Allemagne. Les cinq autres, dont Abraham, meurent à Paris.</p>
<h2>Quelle est l'histoire d'Abraham?</h2>
<p>Le diaporama suivant a été préparé afin de vous présenter les huit Inuits ainsi qu’un sommaire de leur histoire. Prenez quelques instants pour rencontrer Abraham, sa famille et ses compagnons de voyage, ainsi que pour admirer la majesté des paysages de leur terre natale, le Nunatsiavut.</p>

<h2><strong>Qu'est-ce que cette recherche veut accomplir?<br/></strong></h2>
<p>Lettré, Abraham a documenté ses états d'âmes et son séjour dans son journal personnel et dans quelques lettres.  Ses écrits nous donnent un aperçu sur ce qui s'est passé lorsque le groupe était exhibé en Allemagne et à Prague. Malheureusement, ses textes sont silencieux au sujet de leur séjour à Paris et, jusqu'à aujourd'hui personne n'a tenté d'élucider des événements survenus à Paris avant et après la mort des Inuits.</p>
<p><span lang=""en""><span class=""hps""><img alt=""Extract from Abraham's journal"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.polarhorizons.com/Indiegogo/Abraham_extrait_journal.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Extract from Abraham's journal""/>(Portrait d'Abraham Ulrikab et un extrait de son journal présenté dans le cadre de l'exposition « <a href=""http://www.quaibranly.fr/fr/programmation/expositions/expositions-passees/exhibitions.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">L'invention du sauvage: Exhibitions</a> » présentée au Musée du Quai Branly à  Paris du 29 novembre 2011 au 3 juin 2012.)</span></span></p>
<p>Ces Inuits ne se sont pas tout simplement volatilisés! Ils doivent y avoir laissé des traces. Quelle a été la séquence des événements du moment où ils sont arrivés à Paris jusqu’au moment où ils sont morts? Où sont leurs traces? Où ont-ils été inhumés?</p>
<p>Telles sont les questions auxquelles le projet « Sur les traces d'Abraham Ulrikab » tente de répondre.</p>
<p>Depuis 2010, j’effectue des recherches pour rassembler les morceaux du casse-tête. Plus je fouille et plus l’histoire s’avère captivante. Mon séjour de deux semaines à Paris à l’automne 2011 a prouvé hors de tout doute que mes efforts ne sont pas vains. Il y a effectivement un fascinant chapitre à ajouter.</p>
<p>En supportant ce projet, vous deviendrez donc un « Ami d'Abraham » et serez témoin de cette recherche. Vous serez assis aux premières loges et vous sentirez l'émotion et l'excitation d’assister au dévoilement d’un nouveau chapitre de cette tragique histoire.</p>

<strong>Ce qui a été</strong><strong> publié à ce jour sur l'histoire d'Abraham Ulrikab</strong>
</h2>
<p>L'histoire d'Abraham Ulrikab peut sonner une cloche pour certains d'entre vous puisqu’il a déjà fait l'objet de quelques publications. Les principales étant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Un article publié dans <em>Canadian Geographic </em>en 1981 par l’ethnologue canadien James Garth Taylor qui venait de découvrir par pur hasard une copie de la traduction allemande du journal personnel d’Abraham. C’est par le biais de cet article que l’histoire d’Abraham fut alors dévoilée au public du 20e siècle.  </li>
<li>Un article publié en allemand, puis en anglais, par l’ethnologue allemande Hilke Thode-Arora qui a effectué de plus amples recherches.</li>
<li>Puis, en 2005, le professeur universitaire Hartmut Lutz et ses étudiants de l'Université de Greifswald, en Allemagne, traduisirent le journal d’Abraham en anglais et en publièrent l’intégralité dans un livre, <em>The Diary of Abraham Ulrikab: Text and Context</em>, qui fut suivi en 2007 par une version allemande.</li>

<h2><strong>Pourquoi cette recherche est-elle importante?</strong></h2>
<p>Depuis deux ans maintenant que je donne mon temps et que je pige dans mes réserves personnelles afin de faire avancer cette recherche.  Je compte bien continuer pour aussi longtemps que ce sera nécessaire puisque je suis convaincue que mes recherches permettront aux Inuits du Labrador (si ce n’est de permettre à tous les Inuits du monde circumpolaire) de <strong>regagner une partie de la dignité qui a été enlevée à leurs prédécesseurs</strong>. </p>
<p>Je vous invite à joindre les « Amis d'Abraham » si comme moi, vous considérez que :</p>
<ul>
<li>Nous devons à Abraham, Ulrike, Terrianiak, Paingo, Tobias, Noggasak, Sara et Maria de veiller à ce que <strong>leur mort n'ait pas été vaine</strong>. Tout ce qu’ils espéraient était d’améliorer leurs conditions de vie une fois de retour chez eux. En Europe, les Inuits ont amusé les foules de curieux, ont permis à des entrepreneurs d’empocher des profits et ont été étudiés par les anthropologues de l’époque heureux d'avoir à leur disposition des « sauvages » provenant de ces terres lointaines. Ils ont payé le prix ultime.</li>
<li>De découvrir et de raconter toute leur histoire est <strong>la moindre des choses que l’on puisse faire pour eux.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Une attente de 132 ans est suffisamment longue</strong>. Il est donc grand temps d’élucider les mystères qui planent toujours et de faire connaître un nouveau chapitre de cette histoire.</li>
</ul><p>Le but de cette recherche n’est pas de juger les événements passés ou de blâmer des agissements qui, avec nos yeux d’aujourd’hui, nous semblent impensables. Je veux simplement documenter les événements de façon exacte et respectueuse de sorte que la boucle de cette histoire tragique puisse enfin être bouclée.</p>
<h2 align=""center""><strong>Quels sont les biens livrables du projet? <br/></strong></h2>
<h3>
<strong>Publication d’un livre « Je suis Abraham, l’époux d’Ulrike » </strong>(Date visée: mai 2013)</h3>
<p><img alt=""Couverture ebook1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.polarhorizons.com/Indiegogo/Couverture_ebook1_FR_200px.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 10px;"" title=""Couverture ebook1""/>L’histoire d’Abraham n’ayant jamais fait l’objet de publication en français, il m’apparaît essentiel que les francophones aient accès aux informations de base, et ce, avant que les détails des événements qui se sont déroulés à Paris soient dévoilés.</p>
<p>Donc, avant de partir pour Paris, je publierai un livre (en format PDF) afin que vous puissiez lire les écrits d’Abraham (son journal et ses lettres) et obtenir un aperçu général de l’histoire telle qu’elle est présentement connue.</p>
<p>Le but de ce livre est donc de préparer le terrain pour le reste du projet. Afin que le plus grand nombre d’ « Amis d’Abraham » puisse y avoir accès, il sera publié en français et en anglais. Grand merci au Professeur Hartmut Lutz de me permettre de reproduire, dans la version anglaise, les traductions que lui et ses étudiants ont rédigées.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>Recherche à Paris</strong> (Date visée: juin 2013)</h3>
<p><img alt=""Eglise Notre-Dame, Paris"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.polarhorizons.com/Indiegogo/Notre_Dame_sepia.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 30px 10px;"" title=""Eglise Notre-Dame, Paris""/>Durant le voyage de recherche à Paris, en tant qu’« Ami d’Abraham » vous recevrez au minimum un compte-rendu par semaine. Je serai accompagnée par un vidéographe.  Des photographies et vidéos vous informeront donc des progrès accomplis, des sites visités, des personnes rencontrées, des faits découverts, … Vous sentirez la fébrilité de faire partie des premiers à apprendre ce qui s’est passé en 1881.</p>
<p>Ces comptes rendus seront disponibles en français et en anglais et seront exclusifs aux « Amis d’Abraham ».</p>
<h3>
<strong>Publication du livre « Sur les traces d’Abraham Ulrikab – Paris »</strong> (Date visée : novembre 2013)</h3>
<p>Une fois de retour de Paris, j’écrirai un second livre « Sur les traces d’Abraham Ulrikab – Paris » (à être publié en format PDF) afin de raconter l’histoire de ce projet de recherche et pour révéler les faits découverts à Paris.</p>
<p>Pendant l’écriture du livre, les « Amis d’Abraham » vont continuer à recevoir des comptes rendus exclusifs qui seront disponibles en français et en anglais.</p>

<h2>
<strong>D</strong><strong>e quelle façon les fonds seront-ils utilisés?</strong>
</h2>
<p>Les fonds sont nécessaires pour couvrir les frais suivants:</p>
<ul>
<li>La traduction (de l’allemand au français) du journal et des lettres d’Abraham, la traduction (du français à l’anglais) des documents découverts à Paris,des deux livres électroniques et des comptes-rendus;</li>
<li>La production des deux livres électroniques (design de la couverture, mise en page du livre, révision, …);</li>
<li>L’acquisition des photographies;</li>
<li>La collaboration de divers spécialistes (scientifiques, anthropologues, ethnologues, …) pour aider à la rédaction et/ou la validation de certains textes du second livre;</li>
<li>Le coût du vol aérien (Ottawa-Paris) pour 2 personnes (recherchiste &amp; vidéographe);</li>
<li>Les frais de subsistance, de transport et autres dépenses engagées pendant le voyage de recherche de 3 semaines à Paris ;</li>
<li>Récompenser financièrement ceux et celles qui ont permis à ce projet de « crowdfunding » de voir le jour : les photographes + le compositeur de la musique originale du diaporama;</li>
<li>La production et l’envoi des contreparties.</li>
</ul><h3 align=""center""><strong>Surfinancement</strong></h3>
<p>Si tant de gens se sentent interpellés et deviennent des « Amis d'Abraham » de sorte que l'objectif financier initial soit dépassé, voici quelques activités qui sont actuellement sur la liste de tâches à accomplir et/ou d'autres utilités pour les fonds supplémentaires. Une fois la campagne terminée et le montant total du financement connu, nous analyserons les diverses possibilités:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investiguer la production d’une version imprimée du livre « Sur les traces d’Abraham Ulrikab – Paris ».</li>
<li>Si nécessaire, rallonger le séjour à Paris pour continuer les recherches.</li>
<li>Effectuer un séjour à Hambourg afin de mener des recherches dans des archives qui sont susceptibles de détenir la clé de certains mystères entourant les événements qui se sont déroulés à Paris.</li>
<li>Rémunérer le vidéographe et l'adjointe du projet qui travailleront très fort au cours des mois à venir.</li>
<li>Produire un documentaire racontant l'histoire de ce projet de recherche.</li>
<li>Préparer un voyage au Nunatsiavut et travailler en collaboration avec le Centre culturel Torngâsok pour rencontrer la communauté inuite afin d’écouter et de documenter leurs sentiments, pensées et préoccupations au sujet des faits nouveaux qui ont été découverts à Paris. Profiter de l'occasion pour rencontrer des aînés inuits qui se souviennent encore de leurs parents ou grands-parents leur racontant l'histoire d'Abraham.</li>
<li>Mener des recherches pour tenter d'identifier s’il existe encore aujourd’hui des descendants reliés aux Inuits décédés en Europe. Nous sommes toujours à la recherche du journal original d'Abraham en inuktitut. Pourrait-il être caché dans le grenier d'un descendant d'un membre de la famille?</li>

<h2><strong>Qui suis-je?</strong></h2>
<p>Consultante en informatique pendant plus de 23 ans, en 2007, j'ai effectué un changement de carrière important et fondé Horizons Polaires. Depuis, je dédie mon temps et mes compétences en tant que photographe, rédactrice pigiste, éducatrice et recherchiste à montrer les beautés de l'Arctique aux enfants et au grand public. Plusieurs de mes textes et photos ont été publiés dans les journaux et magazines du Québec. Je collabore à la revue Marche-Randonnée depuis plus de 20 ans. Récemment, j’ai été publiée par Above and Beyond (magazine de la compagnie aérienne First Air), le magazine de la Société Makivik et dans un livre du Reader’s Digest.</p>
<p>Entendre parler de l'histoire d'Abraham Ulrikab a réveillé une autre de mes passions: la recherche dans les archives (ayant fait de la généalogie pendant plus de 30 ans). Depuis 2010, j’ai entrepris de découvrir ce qui s’est passé à Paris en 1881. J'ai établi des relations avec la plupart des chercheurs qui ont travaillé sur l'histoire d'Abraham, avec des institutions à Paris ainsi qu'avec le département de la Culture, des Loisirs et du Tourisme du gouvernement du Nunatsiavut. Je travaille en relation étroite avec chacun d'eux. Je suis entièrement dédiée à cette recherche et à veiller à ce que cette histoire tragique puisse enfin arriver à sa fin. Les Inuits du Labrador méritent de savoir ce qui s'est passé.</p>
<p>Pour en savoir plus sur qui je suis, ce que j'ai accompli ou voir des exemples d'articles que j'ai publiés, n'hésitez pas à consulter <a href=""http://polarhorizons.com/france-rivet-bsc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mon profil sur le site web d’Horizons Polaires</a>.</p>

Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.(Carl Edward Sagan)

(Section of the 1880 Poster used by Carl Hagenbeck's Thierpark to advertise the Inuit. Collection Hans-Josef Rollmann.)
Who is Abraham Ulrikab? 
In August 1880, two « Eskimo » families from Labrador voluntarily departed for Europe where they were to become the newest exotic attraction in zoos. Abraham Ulrikab was part of the group. Aged from 13 months to 50 years old, the eight individuals were recruited by Johan Adrian Jacobsen on behalf of Carl Hagenbeck, pioneer of ethnographic shows (known today as « human zoos »). Since 1874, crowds had been flocking to Hagenbeck’s shows where they could observe « savages » originating from different parts of the world. Hagenbeck was hoping to repeat the 1877 success of a group of Greenland « eskimos ».
Unfortunately, a mandatory measure, by German law, was not taken: vaccinate them against smallpox. A deadly mistake. Less than four months after their arrival on European soil, the group no longer existed, having been all killed by smallpox. Three died in Germany. The remaining five, including Abraham, died in Paris.
What is Abraham's story?
The following AV show was prepared to introduce the eight Inuit and to provide a summary of their story. Take a moment to meet Abraham, his family and companions, and to admire the majesty of their homeland, Nunatsiavut.
CLICK ON THE IMAGE TO VIEW THE AV SHOW
If you are curious to find out a bit more about the making-of this AV show.
What is this research looking for?
Literate, Abraham documented his moods and emotions in his personal diary and in letters. Abraham’s writings give us insight on what happened when the group was exhibited in Germany and in Prague. Unfortunately, they are silent about their stay in Paris and until now, nobody has attempted to elucidate the events that occured in Paris prior and following the Inuit's death.
(Excerpt from Abraham's diary as shown in the exhibit « Human Zoos, The Invention of the Savage » at the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris from November 29, 2011 to June 3, 2012. See the galery for the English translation of the excerpt.)
These Inuit could not simply have vanished! They must have left traces. What was the sequence of events from the time they arrived in Paris to the time they died? Where are their traces? Where were the Inuit buried?
Those are the questions the project « In the footsteps of Abraham Ulrikab » is trying to answer.
I have been researching this story since 2010. The more I dig, the more riveting the story becomes. My two week stay in Paris in the fall of 2011 proved beyond a doubt that my efforts are not being spent in vain. A fascinating chapter is to be appended to the story.
By supporting this project, you will join the « Friends of Abraham » team and you will witness this search. You will be sitting in the front row and will feel the thrill and excitement of watching the unveiling of a new chapter of this tragic story.

How did this projet come about?
If you are curious to find out how this project came about, I invite you to read the following post I recently published on Polar Horizons' blog: Bon Voyage Lyubov Orlova! The « In the footsteps of Abraham Ulrikab » research project thanks you!
What has been published to date about the Abraham Ulrikab story
Abraham Ulrikab’s story may ring a bell for some of you as it has already been the subject of a few publications. The main ones being:

The article published in Canadian Geographic in 1981 by Canadian ethnologist James Garth Taylor, who uncovered a copy of a German translation of Abraham’s diary and revealed the tragic story to the 20th century public.
Articles published (in German & English) by German ethnologist Hilke Thode-Arora who conducted further research in archives.
In 2005, Abraham’s diary was translated into English by German Professor Hartmut Lutz and his students from the University of Greifswald, in Germany, and published in the book The Diary of Abraham Ulrikab: Text and Context. It was followed by a German version in 2007.
Here is a statement received from Professor Lutz:
When my students and I worked on translating, supplementing and editing Abraham’s Diary, we did so mainly with two things in mind. On the one hand, we felt that this sad and shameful story of racism and inhuman callousness needed to be told, and we were very much aware of our German recent history and the legacy of the Holocaust--a legacy we all felt that needs to be remembered and addressed continuously, so that we can learn from the past and not become guilty again. 
On the other hand, we had strong hopes that our translation and the supplementary materials we found would be read widely in  Canada, and particularly in the Arctic, so that perhaps some of Abraham’s, Ulrike’s, Terrianiniak’s and Paingo’s relatives in Labrador would learn more about the tragic events over a hundred years ago. We were delighted to learn that indeed an Inuk whose family originates from Hebron and wears the same name as Noggasak, the first Inuk to die in Europe in 1880, has read the book and has returned the text to Hebron. We are now deeply grateful to hear that France Rivet is working on a French translation with additional findings about what befell the Inuit families in France, and we fully support all her efforts. – Maybe, one day there will also be a translation into Inuktitut, and then Abraham’s Diary will truly have returned home.
Hartmut Lutz, 21 February 2013

Why this research matters
I have been donating my time and money to this research for more than two years and I’ll keep working at it for as long as it takes. The reason? Because I am convinced that my research will allow today’s Labrador Inuit (and Inuit throughout the circumpolar world) to regain part of the dignity that was taken from their predecessors.
I invite you to join the « Friends of Abraham » if, like me, you believe that:

We owe it to Abraham, Ulrike, Terrianiak, Paingo, Tobias, Noggasak, Sara and Maria to ensure that their deaths did not occur in vain. All they wanted was to improve their basic living conditions upon their return. On European soil, the eight Inuit entertained the crowds, enabled entrepreneurs to pocket profits and agreed to be studied by anthropologists who were most happy to have at their disposal “savages” originating from such faraway lands. They paid the ultimate price. 

Uncovering and telling the whole story is the least we can do for them.


A wait period of 132 year is long enough. It is therefore high time to solve the mysteries that still hover and to make this new chapter known.

The purpose of this research is not to judge people’s actions of the past or to put blame on what, today, we consider as being wrong doing. I simply want to document the events in an accurate and respectful manner so that this tragic story can finally come to a close.
What are the project deliverables? 

Publication of the ebook « I am Abraham, Ulrike’s husband » (target date: May 2013)
Abraham Ulrikab’s story having never been published in French, I must ensure that Parisians and France’s population have access to the story, as it is currently known, before the details of the events that took place on their territory are released.
Therefore, before heading to Paris, I will publish a book (in PDF format) which will include Abraham’s own words (his diary and letters) as well as give a general overview of the story.
The purpose of this digital book is therefore to set the stage for the rest of the project. So that as many « Friends of Abraham » as possible have access to this deliverable, it will be available in French and English. Thanks to the generosity of Professor Hartmut Lutz, the English translations of Abraham’s diary and letters produced by him and his students will be reproduced in the English version of this book.

Research in Paris (Target date : June 2013)
During this research trip to Paris, as a « Friend of Abraham » you will receive at least one update report per week.  In Paris, I will be accompanied by a videographer. Photographs and videoclips will be used to inform you of our progress, the sites we’ve visited, the people we’ve met, the facts we have uncovered, etc. You will feel the excitement of being the first ones to know about what happened to Abraham and his family.
All update reports will be available in French and English and will be exclusive to the «Friends of Abraham».

Publication of the ebook « In the footsteps of Abraham Ulrikab – Paris » (Target date : November 2013)
Once I have returned from Paris, I will write a second ebook « In the footsteps of Abraham Ulrikab - Paris »  telling the story of this research project and revealing the discoveries from Paris.  
While the ebook is being written, « Friends of Abraham » will continue to receive exclusive update reports (available in French and English).

How will the funds be used?
The funds are needed to cover the following costs:

the translations of Abraham’s diary & letters (German to French), of documents uncovered in Paris and of the two ebooks (from French to English);
the production of the two ebooks (including cover design, layout, editing, …),
the acquisition of historical photographs;
the collaboration of specialists (scientists, anthropologists, ethnologists, …) to help with the writing and/or the validation of some sections of the second ebook;
the airfare (Ottawa-Paris) for the researcher and a videographer,
living expenses, transportation and other expenses incurred during the 3 week research trip to Paris for the researcher and the videographer;
Provide an honorarium payment for those who have helped this crowdfunding project happen: the photographers + the composer of the original soundtrack used in the AV show;
The production and mailing of rewards.
What if there is over-financing?
If so many people feel compelled to become a « Friend of Abraham » and the initial financial goal is exceeded, here are a few activities that are currently on the project's « to-do » list and/or ways that the extra money could be used. Once the campaign is over and the total amount raised is known, we will analyze the different options:

Look into the production of a printed version of the book « In the footsteps of Abraham Ulrikab – Paris ».
Extend the stay in Paris, if need be.
Head to Hamburg in order to conduct research in archives we believe may very well hold the key to some of the mysteries surrounding the Paris events.

Financially reward the videographer and project assistant who will both be working very hard in the coming months.
Produce a documentary out of the collection of videos we will have brought back from Paris to tell the story of this research project.

Plan a trip to Nunatsiavut and work with the Torngâsok Cultural Center to meet with the Inuit community in order to hear and document their feelings, thoughts, and concerns about the facts uncovered in Paris. Take the opportunity to meet with Inuit elders who still remember their parents or grand-parents telling them the story of Abraham.
Conduct research to try to identify if there are any living descendants of the two families who died in Europe. We’re still looking for Abraham’s original diary in Inuktitut! Could it be hidden in the attic of a family member’s descendant?
Description of some of the rewards
« Friends of Abraham World Map »
So that we all have a visual representation of where the « Friends of Abraham » are located, I will be maintaining a « Friends of Abraham World Map » where the name of each and every person will be pinned on the map.
Each « Friend of Abraham » will be receiving a high-level photograph of this map. Depending on your pledge level, you could also be receiving a photo of your name pinned on the map. Wouldn’t it  be cool if Abraham had friends on all continents?
Special edition of the Nunatsiavut Notebook
Polar Horizons has designed a collection of five notebooks on various polar themes. One of them aims to show the beauty of Abraham’s homeland, Nunatsiavut.
A special edition, exclusive to the « Friends of Abraham », will be produced. It will include some of the photos appearing in the AV show accompanying this project description. These photos were taken by master photographer Hans Blohm or Bill Pratt. The notebook (15 X 23 cm / 6"" X 9"") has a total of 80 pages and over twenty photos.  
See a preview of the existing Nunatsiavut notebook currently available on Blurb’s website to give you a feel.
 
Polar Horizons’ Art cards
Polar Horizons has developed a catalog of art cards comprised of more than 225 images that explore a variety of polar and nature themes (flora, wildlife and landscapes ...). Our art cards catalog features the work of a talented group of photographers and a painter. The cards are handcrafted in Canada, are mounted on 5""X7"" (12,5 cm X 17,75 cm ) cardstock, are blank inside and individually packaged with an envelope in a crystal clear bag.
A new collection of cards, exclusive to the « Friends of Abraham », featuring scenes from Paris will be created.  
Depending on your pledge level, you could be receiving a selection of these cards as your rewards so, please take a look at the catalog and start noting your list of choices.
Here's a chart of the rewards. A few clarifications (appearing in blue) were added on April 4th. Click on it to access the PDF version:

Who am I?
An IT consultant for more than 23 years, in 2007 I did a major career change and founded Polar Horizons. For the past six years, I have been dedicating my time and skills as a photographer, freelance writer, educator and researcher to showing the beauties of the Arctic to children and the general public. Several of my texts and photos have been published in Quebec newspapers and magazines. Recently, my writing and/or photographs have appeared in Above and Beyond (First Air’s inflight magazine), Makivik magazine and a Reader’s Digest hardcover book.
Hearing about the Abraham Ulrikab story woke up another passion of mine: archival research (I conducted genealogical research for more than 30 years). Since 2010, I have taken it upon myself to go out and uncover what happened in Paris in 1881. I have established relationships with most of the previous actors who researched Abraham’s story, with institutions in Paris as well as with the Culture, Recreation and Tourism department of the government of Nunatsiavut. I am working in close relationship with all of them. I am fully dedicated to this research and to ensuring that this tragic story can finally come to a close. The Labrador Inuit deserve to know what happened.
If you are interested to know more about who I am, what I have accomplished or see samples of articles I have written, please feel free to check my profile on Polar Horizons’ website.
How can you help?
There are different ways in which you can contribute to this project:


By joining the «Friends of Abraham» team. To do so, you simply have to choose your level of contribution on the right-hand side of this page. Of course, I’d be thrilled if you did.  You won’t regret doing so once you see all the excitement this project will generate .

By spreading the word and inviting anyone you know who has an interest in the Inuit culture, in Labrador and Nunatsiavut, in history, in anthropology/ethnology, etc. to take part in the adventure.

If you know of anyone who believe they are related to the families of Abraham, Ulrike, Tobias, Terrianiak or Paingo, whether they are direct or collateral descendants (i.e. descendants of a brother, sister of the above mentionned people), please tell them to get in touch with me. We are still looking for Abraham's original diary. Could it be in a descendant's attic?

If you remember seeing photographs or any documents relating to these eight Inuit in your family's photo albums or archives, please get in touch with me.  We know that Abraham has signed many autographs for the crowd who came to see them. Wouldn't it be wonderful to retrace a document holding his original signature?
Whatever way you decide to contribute, your interest, help and support will be most appreaciated. Thank you so much for taking the time to read and consider my proposal.
I'm looking forward to share this fascinating story with you!
Thank you! Nakkumek! France Rivet
There is strength in numbers, and if we all work together as a team, we can be unstoppable."" (Craig Kielburger, founder of Free The Children, an organization to stop child slavery)

Quelque part, quelque chose d’incroyable attend d’être connu.(Carl Edward Sagan)

Qui est Abraham Ulrikab?
En août 1880, deux familles « esquimaudes » quittent volontairement le Labrador pour l’Europe afin de devenir la plus récente attraction exotique de jardins zoologiques. Abraham Ulrikab fait partie du groupe. Âgés de 13 mois à 50 ans, les huit individus ont été recrutés par Johan Adrian Jacobsen pour le compte de Carl Hagenbeck, pionnier des spectacles ethnographiques (connus aujourd'hui sous le terme « zoos humains »). Depuis 1874, ces spectacles attirent les foules curieuses d’observer des «sauvages» provenant de divers coins de la planète. Avec l’embauche de ces « esquimaux », Hagenbeck espère répéter le succès obtenu en 1877 par un groupe du Groenland.
Toutefois, cette fois-ci, une mesure imposée par la loi allemande n'est pas prise, celle de les vacciner contre la variole. Une erreur fatale. Moins de quatre mois après son arrivée en sol européen, le groupe n’existe plus, tous ayant été emportés par la variole. Trois meurent en Allemagne. Les cinq autres, dont Abraham, meurent à Paris.
Quelle est l'histoire d'Abraham?
Le diaporama suivant a été préparé afin de vous présenter les huit Inuits ainsi qu’un sommaire de leur histoire. Prenez quelques instants pour rencontrer Abraham, sa famille et ses compagnons de voyage, ainsi que pour admirer la majesté des paysages de leur terre natale, le Nunatsiavut.
CLIQUER SUR L'IMAGE POUR VISIONNER LE DIAPORAMA

Si vous êtes curieux d'en apprendre à propos des dessous de ce diaporama.
Qu'est-ce que cette recherche veut accomplir?
Lettré, Abraham a documenté ses états d'âmes et son séjour dans son journal personnel et dans quelques lettres.  Ses écrits nous donnent un aperçu sur ce qui s'est passé lorsque le groupe était exhibé en Allemagne et à Prague. Malheureusement, ses textes sont silencieux au sujet de leur séjour à Paris et, jusqu'à aujourd'hui personne n'a tenté d'élucider des événements survenus à Paris avant et après la mort des Inuits.
(Portrait d'Abraham Ulrikab et un extrait de son journal présenté dans le cadre de l'exposition « L'invention du sauvage: Exhibitions » présentée au Musée du Quai Branly à  Paris du 29 novembre 2011 au 3 juin 2012.)
Ces Inuits ne se sont pas tout simplement volatilisés! Ils doivent y avoir laissé des traces. Quelle a été la séquence des événements du moment où ils sont arrivés à Paris jusqu’au moment où ils sont morts? Où sont leurs traces? Où ont-ils été inhumés?
Telles sont les questions auxquelles le projet « Sur les traces d'Abraham Ulrikab » tente de répondre.
Depuis 2010, j’effectue des recherches pour rassembler les morceaux du casse-tête. Plus je fouille et plus l’histoire s’avère captivante. Mon séjour de deux semaines à Paris à l’automne 2011 a prouvé hors de tout doute que mes efforts ne sont pas vains. Il y a effectivement un fascinant chapitre à ajouter.
En supportant ce projet, vous deviendrez donc un « Ami d'Abraham » et serez témoin de cette recherche. Vous serez assis aux premières loges et vous sentirez l'émotion et l'excitation d’assister au dévoilement d’un nouveau chapitre de cette tragique histoire.

Comment ce projet a-t-il vu le jour?
Si vous êtes curieux de découvrir comment ce projet de recherche a vu le jour, je vous invite à lire le texte suivant que j'ai récemment publié sur le blogue d’Horizons Polaires: Bon Voyage Lyubov Orlova! Le projet  « Sur les traces d'Abraham Ulrikab » te remercie!

Ce qui a été publié à ce jour sur l'histoire d'Abraham Ulrikab

L'histoire d'Abraham Ulrikab peut sonner une cloche pour certains d'entre vous puisqu’il a déjà fait l'objet de quelques publications. Les principales étant:

Un article publié dans Canadian Geographic en 1981 par l’ethnologue canadien James Garth Taylor qui venait de découvrir par pur hasard une copie de la traduction allemande du journal personnel d’Abraham. C’est par le biais de cet article que l’histoire d’Abraham fut alors dévoilée au public du 20e siècle.  
Un article publié en allemand, puis en anglais, par l’ethnologue allemande Hilke Thode-Arora qui a effectué de plus amples recherches.
Puis, en 2005, le professeur universitaire Hartmut Lutz et ses étudiants de l'Université de Greifswald, en Allemagne, traduisirent le journal d’Abraham en anglais et en publièrent l’intégralité dans un livre, The Diary of Abraham Ulrikab: Text and Context, qui fut suivi en 2007 par une version allemande.
Voici un communiqué reçu du professeur Lutz:
Lorsque mes étudiants et moi avons travaillé sur la traduction, l'enrichissement et l'édition du journal d'Abraham, nous l'avons fait en gardant deux points à l'esprit. D'une part, nous estimions que cette triste et honteuse histoire de racisme et d'insensibilité inhumaine devait être racontée, et nous étions très conscients de notre histoire allemande récente et de l'héritage de l'Holocauste - un héritage qu'il nous semble nécessaire de se rappeler et de traiter en permanence, de sorte que nous puissions apprendre du passé et ne pas devenir coupable à nouveau.
D'autre part, nous avions de grands espoirs que notre traduction et les documents complémentaires que nous avons trouvés seraient largement lus au Canada, et particulièrement dans l'Arctique, et que peut-être, certains parents au Labrador d'Abraham, d'Ulrike, de Terrianiniak ou de Paingo en apprendraient plus sur les événements tragiques d'il y a cent ans. Nous étions ravis d'apprendre qu'une Inuk dont la famille est originaire de Hébron et porte le même nom que Noggasak, la première Inuk à mourir en Europe en 1880, a lu le livre et l'a ramené à Hébron. Nous sommes maintenant très reconnaissants d'apprendre que France Rivet travaille sur une traduction en français avec des ajouts supplémentaires sur ce qui est arrivé aux familles inuites en France, et nous soutenons pleinement tous ses efforts. Peut-être, un jour y aura-t-il aussi une traduction en inuktitut afin que le journal d'Abraham puisse véritablement rentré chez lui.
Hartmut Lutz, 21 février 2013

Pourquoi cette recherche est-elle importante?
Depuis deux ans maintenant que je donne mon temps et que je pige dans mes réserves personnelles afin de faire avancer cette recherche.  Je compte bien continuer pour aussi longtemps que ce sera nécessaire puisque je suis convaincue que mes recherches permettront aux Inuits du Labrador (si ce n’est de permettre à tous les Inuits du monde circumpolaire) de regagner une partie de la dignité qui a été enlevée à leurs prédécesseurs. 
Je vous invite à joindre les « Amis d'Abraham » si comme moi, vous considérez que :

Nous devons à Abraham, Ulrike, Terrianiak, Paingo, Tobias, Noggasak, Sara et Maria de veiller à ce que leur mort n'ait pas été vaine. Tout ce qu’ils espéraient était d’améliorer leurs conditions de vie une fois de retour chez eux. En Europe, les Inuits ont amusé les foules de curieux, ont permis à des entrepreneurs d’empocher des profits et ont été étudiés par les anthropologues de l’époque heureux d'avoir à leur disposition des « sauvages » provenant de ces terres lointaines. Ils ont payé le prix ultime.
De découvrir et de raconter toute leur histoire est la moindre des choses que l’on puisse faire pour eux.


Une attente de 132 ans est suffisamment longue. Il est donc grand temps d’élucider les mystères qui planent toujours et de faire connaître un nouveau chapitre de cette histoire.
Le but de cette recherche n’est pas de juger les événements passés ou de blâmer des agissements qui, avec nos yeux d’aujourd’hui, nous semblent impensables. Je veux simplement documenter les événements de façon exacte et respectueuse de sorte que la boucle de cette histoire tragique puisse enfin être bouclée.
Quels sont les biens livrables du projet? 

Publication d’un livre « Je suis Abraham, l’époux d’Ulrike » (Date visée: mai 2013)
L’histoire d’Abraham n’ayant jamais fait l’objet de publication en français, il m’apparaît essentiel que les francophones aient accès aux informations de base, et ce, avant que les détails des événements qui se sont déroulés à Paris soient dévoilés.
Donc, avant de partir pour Paris, je publierai un livre (en format PDF) afin que vous puissiez lire les écrits d’Abraham (son journal et ses lettres) et obtenir un aperçu général de l’histoire telle qu’elle est présentement connue.
Le but de ce livre est donc de préparer le terrain pour le reste du projet. Afin que le plus grand nombre d’ « Amis d’Abraham » puisse y avoir accès, il sera publié en français et en anglais. Grand merci au Professeur Hartmut Lutz de me permettre de reproduire, dans la version anglaise, les traductions que lui et ses étudiants ont rédigées.
 

Recherche à Paris (Date visée: juin 2013)
Durant le voyage de recherche à Paris, en tant qu’« Ami d’Abraham » vous recevrez au minimum un compte-rendu par semaine. Je serai accompagnée par un vidéographe.  Des photographies et vidéos vous informeront donc des progrès accomplis, des sites visités, des personnes rencontrées, des faits découverts, … Vous sentirez la fébrilité de faire partie des premiers à apprendre ce qui s’est passé en 1881.
Ces comptes rendus seront disponibles en français et en anglais et seront exclusifs aux « Amis d’Abraham ».

Publication du livre « Sur les traces d’Abraham Ulrikab – Paris » (Date visée : novembre 2013)
Une fois de retour de Paris, j’écrirai un second livre « Sur les traces d’Abraham Ulrikab – Paris » (à être publié en format PDF) afin de raconter l’histoire de ce projet de recherche et pour révéler les faits découverts à Paris.
Pendant l’écriture du livre, les « Amis d’Abraham » vont continuer à recevoir des comptes rendus exclusifs qui seront disponibles en français et en anglais.

De quelle façon les fonds seront-ils utilisés?

Les fonds sont nécessaires pour couvrir les frais suivants:

La traduction (de l’allemand au français) du journal et des lettres d’Abraham, la traduction (du français à l’anglais) des documents découverts à Paris,des deux livres électroniques et des comptes-rendus;
La production des deux livres électroniques (design de la couverture, mise en page du livre, révision, …);
L’acquisition des photographies;
La collaboration de divers spécialistes (scientifiques, anthropologues, ethnologues, …) pour aider à la rédaction et/ou la validation de certains textes du second livre;
Le coût du vol aérien (Ottawa-Paris) pour 2 personnes (recherchiste & vidéographe);
Les frais de subsistance, de transport et autres dépenses engagées pendant le voyage de recherche de 3 semaines à Paris ;
Récompenser financièrement ceux et celles qui ont permis à ce projet de « crowdfunding » de voir le jour : les photographes + le compositeur de la musique originale du diaporama;
La production et l’envoi des contreparties.
Surfinancement
Si tant de gens se sentent interpellés et deviennent des « Amis d'Abraham » de sorte que l'objectif financier initial soit dépassé, voici quelques activités qui sont actuellement sur la liste de tâches à accomplir et/ou d'autres utilités pour les fonds supplémentaires. Une fois la campagne terminée et le montant total du financement connu, nous analyserons les diverses possibilités:

Investiguer la production d’une version imprimée du livre « Sur les traces d’Abraham Ulrikab – Paris ».
Si nécessaire, rallonger le séjour à Paris pour continuer les recherches.
Effectuer un séjour à Hambourg afin de mener des recherches dans des archives qui sont susceptibles de détenir la clé de certains mystères entourant les événements qui se sont déroulés à Paris.
Rémunérer le vidéographe et l'adjointe du projet qui travailleront très fort au cours des mois à venir.
Produire un documentaire racontant l'histoire de ce projet de recherche.
Préparer un voyage au Nunatsiavut et travailler en collaboration avec le Centre culturel Torngâsok pour rencontrer la communauté inuite afin d’écouter et de documenter leurs sentiments, pensées et préoccupations au sujet des faits nouveaux qui ont été découverts à Paris. Profiter de l'occasion pour rencontrer des aînés inuits qui se souviennent encore de leurs parents ou grands-parents leur racontant l'histoire d'Abraham.
Mener des recherches pour tenter d'identifier s’il existe encore aujourd’hui des descendants reliés aux Inuits décédés en Europe. Nous sommes toujours à la recherche du journal original d'Abraham en inuktitut. Pourrait-il être caché dans le grenier d'un descendant d'un membre de la famille?
Description de quelques contreparties
Carte du monde des Amis d’Abraham
Afin que nous ayons tous une représentation visuelle de la distribution géographique des « Amis d'Abraham », je maintiendrai une « Carte du monde des amis d’Abraham » où le nom de chaque ami sera épinglé sur la carte à l'endroit de sa résidence.
Chaque « Ami d’Abraham » recevra une photographie générale de la carte. Selon la catégorie de votre don, vous pourriez aussi recevoir une photo de votre nom épinglé sur la carte. Ne serait-il pas merveilleux si Abraham avait des amis sur tous les continents?
Édition spéciale du carnet de notes sur le Nunatsiavut
Horizons Polaires a conçu une collection de cinq carnets de notes sur différents thèmes polaires. L’un de ces carnets vise à montrer les beautés du Nunatsiavut,  patrie d’Abraham.
Une édition spéciale exclusive aux « Amis d'Abraham » sera produite. Elle inclura des photographies prises par le maître photographe Hans Blohm et par le photographe nature Bill Pratt que vous pouvez déjà admirer dans le diaporama.
Le carnet de notes (15 X 23 cm / 6"" X 9"") comportera un total de 80 pages et plus de 20 photos. 
L’aperçu du carnet de notes existant présentement disponible sur le site de Blurb peut vous donner une idée générale de ce à quoi ressemblera l’édition spéciale.
Cartes artistiques d’Horizons Polaires
Horizons Polaires a développé un catalogue de cartes artistiques comprenant plus de 225 images qui explorent une variété de thèmes reliés aux régions polaires et à la nature (flore, faune, paysages, ...). Notre catalogue de cartes artistiques présente le travail d'un groupe talentueux de photographes et d’une peintre. Nos cartes de souhaits sont fabriquées à la main au Canada sur du carton 5"" X 7"" (12,5 cm X 17,75 cm), sont sans texte et emballées individuellement (avec leur enveloppe) dans un sac transparent pour leur protection.
Une nouvelle collection de cartes exclusives aux « Amis d'Abraham» sera créée à partir de scènes mettant en vedette Paris.
Selon la catégorie de votre don, vous serez possiblement appelé à choisir une sélection de ces cartes comme contreparties. N’hésitez pas à jeter un œil sur le catalogue et à commencer à noter vos choix.
Voici une charte des contreparties. Quelques ajouts ont été incorporés le 4 avril. Ils apparaissent en bleu. Cliquer sur la carte pour accéder une version PDF :

Qui suis-je?
Consultante en informatique pendant plus de 23 ans, en 2007, j'ai effectué un changement de carrière important et fondé Horizons Polaires. Depuis, je dédie mon temps et mes compétences en tant que photographe, rédactrice pigiste, éducatrice et recherchiste à montrer les beautés de l'Arctique aux enfants et au grand public. Plusieurs de mes textes et photos ont été publiés dans les journaux et magazines du Québec. Je collabore à la revue Marche-Randonnée depuis plus de 20 ans. Récemment, j’ai été publiée par Above and Beyond (magazine de la compagnie aérienne First Air), le magazine de la Société Makivik et dans un livre du Reader’s Digest.
Entendre parler de l'histoire d'Abraham Ulrikab a réveillé une autre de mes passions: la recherche dans les archives (ayant fait de la généalogie pendant plus de 30 ans). Depuis 2010, j’ai entrepris de découvrir ce qui s’est passé à Paris en 1881. J'ai établi des relations avec la plupart des chercheurs qui ont travaillé sur l'histoire d'Abraham, avec des institutions à Paris ainsi qu'avec le département de la Culture, des Loisirs et du Tourisme du gouvernement du Nunatsiavut. Je travaille en relation étroite avec chacun d'eux. Je suis entièrement dédiée à cette recherche et à veiller à ce que cette histoire tragique puisse enfin arriver à sa fin. Les Inuits du Labrador méritent de savoir ce qui s'est passé.
Pour en savoir plus sur qui je suis, ce que j'ai accompli ou voir des exemples d'articles que j'ai publiés, n'hésitez pas à consulter mon profil sur le site web d’Horizons Polaires.
De quelle façon pouvez-vous aider?
Il vous est possible de contribuer à ce projet de diverses façons :


En rejoignant les « Amis d' Abraham ». Pour ce faire, il vous suffit de choisir votre niveau de contribution dans la section de droite de cette page. Les contreparties que vous recevrez sont identifiées pour chaque niveau. Bien sûr, je serais ravie si vous le pouviez. Vous ne le regretterez pas lorsque vous verrez toute l'excitation que ce projet générera.

En passant le mot et en invitant vos connaissances qui ont un intérêt pour la culture et le peuple inuit, le Labrador, le Nunatsiavut, l'histoire, l’anthropologie / l’ethnologie, etc. à prendre part à l'aventure.

Si vous connaissez quelqu'un dans la communauté inuite qui croit être relié aux familles d'Abraham, Ulrike, Tobias, Terrianiak ou Paingo, SVP demandez-leur d'entrer en contact avec moi. Nous sommes toujours à la recherche de l'original du journal d'Abraham. Pourrait-il se trouver dans le grenier d'un descendant?

Si vous vous souvenez avoir vu des photographies ou des documents reliés à ces huit Inuits dans les album-photos ou vos archives familiales, contactez-moi.  Nous savons également qu'Abraham a signé de multiples autographes pour la foule venue les voir. Ne serait-il pas fantastique de retracer un document portant sa signature originale? 
Peu importe la façon que vous déciderez de contribuer, votre intérêt, aide et support seront grandement appréciés. Merci beaucoup d'avoir pris le temps de lire et de considérer ma proposition.  
J’ai très hâte de partager cette fascinante histoire avec vous.
Merci! Nakkumek! France Rivet

And I've finally decided to do it! In fact, I've already started! It will be filled with everything from childhood stories about my first ""boyfriend"" in Kindergarten to nearly dying in an accidental ""Hangover""-esque mass overdose in a Las Vegas hotel room filled with porn stars. I'll even share valuable life lessons like how to get smudge-resistant lipstick off your genitals after being ""friendly"" with a drag queen in a porta-potty. So it's a kid's book, is what I'm really trying to say! </p>

I do so solemnly swear to not use any of your generous donations to buy cocktails, drugs, the services of sex workers, Sour Cream &amp; Onion Pringles or Gummy Bears. I want to. I want to a lot. But I won't because I respect you all too much. </p>
<p>Even if I fall short of the goal, all money donated will go towards finishing the book. </p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>It ain't ""War &amp; Peace"", but it matters:</h3>
<div>As a comedian, I've dedicated my whole life (seriously, I'm a 37 year old chubby starving artist who's still single and doesn't even own a plant) to the belief that making people laugh (and think) is one of the most powerful things you can do. For the last 7 years TV audiences have seen me on TruTV's ""World's Dumbest"". It's a fun, silly show not meant to change the world... just meant to give you a good laugh at the end of a hard day. And yet, I can't tell you the number of gay kids who have reached out to me to say how much it's meant to them to see me and to see their whole family laugh and accept me in their living room. Some have even used me as a way to come out to their families. I've also had the parents of kids reach out to me to say they love me and their kids love me... and they think their kids might be gay. They've written asking for advise on how to talk to their kids or simply to tell me they've told their kids that ""if you're like Brad, it's completely okay with me"". </div>
<div>I don't think my little book about my less than little life will change the world. But I do think by finally working on a project that will be far more personal than the work I get to do on TV or even onstage, it might make a lot of people laugh, a lot of people happy... and maybe even just a few people inspired or braver in their own life.</div>
<div>As my dear friend, the singer Anne Steele says, ""If I don't tell my story, then who will?""</div> <p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why Now?</h3> <p>I've thought about this project for a long time. I've journaled since I was 12 and I write oped pieces all the time for various publications and websites. So why now &amp; why do I need funding?</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Why Now?: because for the first time in 7 years I don't have a single television show I'm working on. Be it in front or behind the camera, my TV work has consumed a lot of my life for the last 7 years. I love TV more than anything and I'm sure I'll be back to work soon enough. These things go in cycles. In the mean time, I want to use this time to create something of use for my fans. Something maybe a bit more personal and lasting than just some fun TV appearances. So that's why I'm doing it now.</li>
<li>Why Funding?: The truth is, if I had the money myself, I wouldn't seek funding. Every dollar I've ever made since the day I left college has gone towards my work. I know some of you who follow me on social media might say, ""Wait a second, I see this queen sipping champagne in tropical locations every other damn week?!"". The truth is I only get to go to those places because I'm lucky enough to book gigs that bring me there. And the champagne is never mine, but gifts from very loving friends. Believe me, anytime in my life I had the money to buy champagne... I didn't. I put the money into my work which is the only way I've gotten this far in the first place.</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>If you can give it, I can take it!</h3> <p>Whether it's $5 or $5000, every little bit really does help. Though $5000 would be particularly helpful... </p>
<p>And most importantly, please share this shit around the internet! If you're a fan on a budget and can only give $5... but you post this on social media until 10 of your friends donate just to shut you up, well I still count that as YOU donating! See, I'm all about your ego as well as my own (but mostly my own).

<blockquote>Lucky for me, while I was a manager I was able to squirrel away some savings, and since my unemployment ran out without me getting stable work, I have been living on those savings. As my campaign progresses over the summer I will have exhausted my 9 years worth of savings. <br/><br/>

<blockquote>So the money I raise will be mostly (detailed clearly below) to pay my rent and bills while I finish the book, hopefully by December 2015.

</p>
<p>So I am trying to raise $10,000 (Canadian dollars) to pay my rent and bills from September until January, here are the details. Maybe $1500 a month seems like too much for expenses, but i do live in Vancouver, which as you may or may not know is an expensive town to exist in, but it is also awesome, and it is very much my home.</p>
<p>The actual cost of perks are not so high actually, as I will be self publishing like I did my 3 poetry books, using a print on demand model. If i do spectacularly well, i can make a big order of books and save on shipping.</p>
<p>I will be updating my progress and detailing how the money gets spent as I get it, and spend it. Transparency (pun intended) FTW!</p>
<p>monthly expenses</p>
<p>Rent $750 (includes utilities, and internet)</p>
<p>Telephone $72</p>
<p>Health care $80 (prescriptions and monthly BC fees)</p>
<p>Loans/cc bill, misc bank fees: $150</p>
<p>Food etc (ie occasional going out to eat/network included) $350</p>
<p>Bus fare/emergency things $98</p>
<p>$1500 a month x 5 months (August-December) = $7500</p>
<p>Fulfilling perks/fees to indiegogo etc:</p>
<p>$2500 =</p>
<p>$2000 - to fulfil the book orders, and other perks, when the book is complete. (if I get the money I am looking for, this number will go up or down if I surpass, or don't make my goals. (includes small percentage that goes to Indiegogo!)</p>
<p>$500 - professional editing services.</p>

<p><b>What Impact will my memoir have on the community, on people?</b></p>
<p>I am hoping to give folks something of an 'alternative' Transgender memoir. I don't feel like my story fits very neatly or at all into the cliched born in the wrong body narrative. The story I am presenting is one of a search for truth, and my real self, thus some of the details about my spiritual life, my creative life, my wonderful friendships and solid if distant family connection. My quest to understand why, and my acceptance that why I am Trans is not as important as how I live and how honest I am in presenting my self. All My Empty Dresses is an exploration of someone who maybe has had more support from friends and family, than from themselves. </p>
<p>I am hoping that I can entertain, and perhaps educate folks that Trans folks are really just folks.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The biggest challenge, when publishing any book is selling it, and getting the word out that it even exists. This is an area where my friends and extended network will be handy. I have a great many friends doing similar projects and my main team member has worked on other successful Indiegogo campaigns. I am plugged into all the social media, and have some small following. </p>
<p>The other big challenge of course is dealing with negative responses to doing this project, anti trans folks, or random trolls. my plan is to deal with any negativity by either ignoring or deflecting it with positive energy. Being Trans*, i m bound to have to deal with a lot of this, if I get even a smidgen of publicity. My biggest challenge will be to keep my cool with hateful folks, but i feel like I am ready for it.

</div></div>","All My Empty Dresses: Memoir of A Strawgirl
A Pitch by Josie Boyce
Does the world need another Transgender Memoir? I say yes we do. We need all the stories we can get. 



My name is Josie Boyce and I’m a Transgender woman working on just such a memoir. I have published three books of poetry, and now that I am well into my transition, everyone has been telling me that I should write a memoir. 
My mom told me I should write a memoir for gosh sakes. Where my memoir will stand apart from the traditional Trans* memoir is my point of view. I am coming at my story, and stories through the lens of someone who has come to terms with much of the pain and heartache of youth. 
There will definitely be some darker stories, but as this is a memoir, not an autobiography, I am not fact checking as much as I am remembering.

I am not just detailing my ‘adventures’ as much as I am putting them in a context of my personal history and who I am now, in this moment. I am not just looking through rose coloured glasses, as I feel that perhaps the more troubling parts of our stories can be where we learn the most about ourselves.



One of the greatest joys of my life has always been sitting around with folks sharing our stories from our lives. This kind of folksy approach is how I have been tackling the book so far.
So why an Indiegogo campaign then, you might be asking yourself.  Good question! Well being a 48 year old Trans woman , who was laid off from being a Video store manager a year ago, I have not been able to find much work, other than piecemeal over the last year. 
Lucky for me, while I was a manager I was able to squirrel away some savings, and since my unemployment ran out without me getting stable work, I have been living on those savings. As my campaign progresses over the summer I will have exhausted my 9 years worth of savings. 

So the money I raise will be mostly (detailed clearly below) to pay my rent and bills while I finish the book, hopefully by December 2015. I am not asking anyone for any kind of free ride, if you contribute, you get my book, and, or some of my art, and some other goodies that I am planning for later in the campaign perks.







What We Need & What You Get
 

So I am trying to raise $10,000 (Canadian dollars) to pay my rent and bills from September until January, here are the details. Maybe $1500 a month seems like too much for expenses, but i do live in Vancouver, which as you may or may not know is an expensive town to exist in, but it is also awesome, and it is very much my home.
The actual cost of perks are not so high actually, as I will be self publishing like I did my 3 poetry books, using a print on demand model. If i do spectacularly well, i can make a big order of books and save on shipping.
I will be updating my progress and detailing how the money gets spent as I get it, and spend it. Transparency (pun intended) FTW!
monthly expenses
Rent $750 (includes utilities, and internet)
Telephone $72
Health care $80 (prescriptions and monthly BC fees)
Loans/cc bill, misc bank fees: $150
Food etc (ie occasional going out to eat/network included) $350
Bus fare/emergency things $98
$1500 a month x 5 months (August-December) = $7500
Fulfilling perks/fees to indiegogo etc:
$2500 =
$2000 - to fulfil the book orders, and other perks, when the book is complete. (if I get the money I am looking for, this number will go up or down if I surpass, or don't make my goals. (includes small percentage that goes to Indiegogo!)
$500 - professional editing services.





Examples of perks that will be made available:
Digital copies of the memoir
soft cover, or hard cover copies of the memoir
memoir copies, and one of my photos, or digital paintings printed for you
Handmade strawgirl yarn dolls, and many more items that will be rolled out as the campaign happens.
*see the righthand sidebar for details!

Why Contribute? 
What Impact will my memoir have on the community, on people?
I am hoping to give folks something of an 'alternative' Transgender memoir. I don't feel like my story fits very neatly or at all into the cliched born in the wrong body narrative. The story I am presenting is one of a search for truth, and my real self, thus some of the details about my spiritual life, my creative life, my wonderful friendships and solid if distant family connection. My quest to understand why, and my acceptance that why I am Trans is not as important as how I live and how honest I am in presenting my self. All My Empty Dresses is an exploration of someone who maybe has had more support from friends and family, than from themselves. 
I am hoping that I can entertain, and perhaps educate folks that Trans folks are really just folks.

    
Risks & Challenges The biggest challenge, when publishing any book is selling it, and getting the word out that it even exists. This is an area where my friends and extended network will be handy. I have a great many friends doing similar projects and my main team member has worked on other successful Indiegogo campaigns. I am plugged into all the social media, and have some small following. 
The other big challenge of course is dealing with negative responses to doing this project, anti trans folks, or random trolls. my plan is to deal with any negativity by either ignoring or deflecting it with positive energy. Being Trans*, i m bound to have to deal with a lot of this, if I get even a smidgen of publicity. My biggest challenge will be to keep my cool with hateful folks, but i feel like I am ready for it. I will not back down. 
The worst I can do with this project is not raise enough money to live for the 5 months, I can still fulfill my perks and finish the book. The worst that happens is that it takes me  a month or two longer to fulfill my orders, because I need to find work to pay the rent.
Having self published 3 poetry books, and a 'zine' Black & White Comic book back in the day, and never losing money on any of my projects gives me the confidence that with money raised to live, and to be able to give my full attention for a few months, I can make this a winning project.
If I exceed my goal, I will be able to afford to do more publicity, to sell more books, and get the word out. This project is about getting the book done, more than it is selling the book. Once it's done I will be making it available to the wider world, and keeping my publicity train running. My stretch goal is to keep writing, Once launched and available to the wider world, hopefully this is something I can do. I have several nearly finished novels that need my attention as soon as this project is done.
    Other Ways You Can Help Now, a lot of people in my life might not be able to afford to contribute, or feel weird about doing so for some reason. But if you do want to help me out, just share this page, share my updates which I will be doing very often.

<p>Hello friends,</p>
<p>My name is John Murray and I grew up in the Bronx, New York. Growing up in 
a house with seven other children was never boring, and my childhood was full of vivid 
memories of crazy and wild adventures. It's easy look back on these adventures 
now and see them as nothing more than the crazy antics of a troublemaking kid 
from the Bronx. Little did I know, however that God was using each one of these 
adventures to teach me something important about Him.</p>
<p>I have spent the last year of my life compiling these adventures into a 
book titled God Verses The Bad Boy. The book contains 260 Scripture 
verses (hence the title!) to go along with the stories. It is my hope to get 
this book published and into the hands of the inmates at the 33rd Street Jail in 
Orlando, Florida. </p>
<p>I have lived in Orlando for the past 26 years. Several years ago, the trial 
of Casey Anthony became a national phenomenon. But for those of us who lived 
nearby, it seemed even more personal. Every day I would drive pass the 33rd St. 
Jail (the same jail Ms. Anthony was incarcerated in) and pray that God would 
send in volunteers to enlighten her and the other inmates with biblical 
knowledge. Little did I know, God was preparing me to be one of those volunteers!</p>
<p>Soon after, my church began a ministry in the 33rd Street facility which I 
became deeply involved with. I worked specifically with the men, and from the 
very first day I stepped foot inside the jail I felt an instant bond with them. 
These guys weren't hardened criminals. They were guys who grew up in a similar 
way I did. They were guys who seemed to have the deck stacked against them from 
the beginning. They were guys who made mistakes - similar to the mistakes I had 
made when I was a "" bad boy"" - but who genuinely wanted to get on a 
better path. I felt as if I had stepped back in time and was hanging out with my 
friends back in the Bronx 1960's era.  </p>
<p>Every Tuesday night, I go into 33rd Street and help facilitate a program 
called reGroup.  reGroup is a recovery program designed for anyone struggling 
with hurts, habits, hangups, of hopelessness (which when you think about it, is 
all of us to some extent!). I love sitting in circles with these men and hearing 
their stories. One thing we ask them to do in reGroup is make a timeline of 
their lives. We encourage them to look back over their lives and discover where 
and when it began to head in the wrong direction. It can be a painful process, 
but it's a necessary step to begin healing old wounds. When you hear some of 
their stories, you can begin to understand how they got on a beaten path that 
led to jail.
</p>
<div>God Verses The Bad Boy is, in essence, my childhood timeline. As I 
tell these stories, I look at them through the lens of Scripture. By doing so, I 
can see that nothing in my life was wasted. I want to provide a copy of my book 
to all the inmates we minister to in 33rd St. My hope is that as they read it, 
they will identify with the stories and see they are not alone in their 
struggles. I hope it will give them a love of Scripture and a desire to dig 
deeper into God's Word. But most of all, I hope it will help them understand 
they are loved by God no matter what they have done, and it's never too late for 
a fresh start.<p></p>
<p>I need your help to make this a reality! I am aiming to raise $7500 to cover 
self-publishing costs, and for the first  200 copies to be printed so I can give 
them away for free. </p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration</p>

<h2>About The Project</h2>
<p>So, what exactly is SoMysterious.com? It's only the latest and greatest Transformation Anthology Project from the mind of Mickey Bamboo!</p>
<p>The premise, as the about page shown above explains, deals with the idea of what if that cliched little shop that sells those oh so mysterious cursed items was absolutely for real? What if your average, mediocre belt  made you gain weight every time you loosened it? Or after buying that specialty barbell for your friend, it turned him into a beefy hairy caveman?</p>
<p>The book will begin with two stories, one being a weight gain tale of over 10,000 words, while the other has yet to be decided. With your help we can add more stories to the book.</p>Thank you for any and all donations, but for those who donate at the higher tiers, you’ll be able to get a specially crafted story included in the anthology. Ever imagine being a huge hairy beefcake? A massive flabby whale, possibly literally? Well here’s your chance!<p>Check out the terms of service below for rules and conditions.</p> <h3>Goals and Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>While we hope to make at least $300 to fund the project, here are our future goals!</p>
<ul>
<li>300 dollars funds the project with a two stories.</li>
<li>500 dollars funds three stories, each of which dealing with a different transformation type.</li>
<li>600 dollars funds a meta plot, a tale weaving between the other stories, starring the SoMysterious.com owners dealing with an overachieving lawyer. Would include corruption, weight gain, muscle growth, and bearification.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further stretch goals will be added should we fulfill the current list. If for some reason we cannot reach our target funding, all money will go towards financing the anthology's main title as well as any custom stories.</p>

While we hope to make at least $300 to fund the project, here are our future goals!

300 dollars funds the project with a two stories.
500 dollars funds three stories, each of which dealing with a different transformation type.
600 dollars funds a meta plot, a tale weaving between the other stories, starring the SoMysterious.com owners dealing with an overachieving lawyer. Would include corruption, weight gain, muscle growth, and bearification.

Further stretch goals will be added should we fulfill the current list. If for some reason we cannot reach our target funding, all money will go towards financing the anthology's main title as well as any custom stories.

<h3>Hi everyone,</h3>
<p>First and foremost I want to thank you for checking out my campaign. This is a path I feel I am being put on by God. I have been through quite the journey, with the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. My goal with this book is to not only give readers a glimpse into some of the things I have gone through, but also to showcase other people's stories. As cliche as it sounds, if this book helps just one person, it will be a success. I would love for you to be a part of that success. </p>
<p>I decided to do a flexible campaign so that any money raised will be used to further my goal of making this book a reality. Please do not take that as a lack of faith on my part by not doing a fixed campaign which would get the exact dollar amount I need. Every $1 raised will go to getting this book out to the masses and by making it a flexible campaign, that means whether I make my desired goal or not, I will get the money that you have contributed by putting your support behind me. In addition to the book, I would like to make a companion website, where I can continue to interview people whose life has gone through significant challenges, but they have persevered. Much like my current website, <a href=""http://www.theactorsaudience.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theactorsaudience.com</a>, this will be a place for people to get their stories out there.</p>
<p>Perks of funding a campaign are part of the process and I hope the perks I am offering will bring in the money I need. </p>
<p>I am launching the campaign on this week of Thanksgiving, but it will run through Christmas and the beginning of 2020. The holiday season sees each person's finances stretched, but it is also the time of year people are the most giving. The impact of this project can be far and wide and each $1 I raise will give someone the opportunity to see that no matter how bad things get, there is always something or someone to hold on to.</p>
<p>Indiegogo asks to be transparent and list some challenges. Every dream you try to make a reality comes with risks. Will people even care about my story or the stories of others? Simply put, I say yes. Nothing is more important than communication, especially in this day and age. Will this journey be an easy one? It may not, BUT I have the drive, passion and desire to make this book happen. It's all about helping others, plain and simple.</p>
<p>For those who absolutely cannot afford to donate even at the lowest level of $1, your support means the world to me. If you believe in me and my purpose, please share the campaign so that others you know may be able to contribute. </p>
<p>Again, thank you for just even taking the time to read this all the way through and considering a donation. Join me on this journey! </p>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>Beautiful People tells the origin story of 8 woman-of-color-founded companies in the beauty industry. The beauty industry is worth <i>$530 BILLION</i>. While the industry was primarily driven by giant conglomerates who own all the brands we are exposed to on a daily basis, at the drugstore and retailers like Sephora, many women did not find that these cookie cutter, repeat products fit their needs, so they decided to create their own. The women who created these companies became extremely successful and began a movement that eventually chipped away at the conglomerate-driven industry and paved the way for independent, diverse bands to emerge.<br/><br/>My name is Sadichchha (Sa-dee-cha), and I am the author of Beautiful People. I wrote this book as a reflection of my own experiences shopping for products that never really fit me, and I know other women have had this experience too. Over the past few years, I’ve seen a lot of brands step away from this and develop a diverse range of products, I've seen women of color start to get visibility in this industry, and I've seen indie brands gaining popularity. This didn’t just happen overnight though. So how did it happen?<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the origin stories of companies that have found financial and commercial success in the beauty industry and have paved the way for others to follow suit. It is through these stories that I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for understanding the business case of beauty. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you navigate the future of this industry.<br/><br/><strong>In this book, you’ll get to know:</strong><ul>
<li>Rea Ann Silva’s Beautyblender and her successes as a make up artist, mother to Erica Dickerson, and then as a category creator;</li>
<li>Toni Ko’s NYX Cosmetics and Bespoke Beauty Brands and her entrepreneurship genes catapulting her career in beauty;</li>
<li>Huda Kattan’s Huda Beauty and her path from DIY lashes to a billion-dollar empire;</li>
<li>Vicky Tsai’s Tatcha and her love story with Japanese beauty rituals;</li>
<li>Nancy Twine’s Briogeo and her journey with natural hair care products;</li>
<li>Heela Yang and Camila Pierotti’s Sol de Janeiro and their ode to Brazilian skincare and sunshine;</li>
<li>Deepica Mutyala’s Live Tinted and her focus on community-building and inclusion for women in beauty; </li>
<li>Amanda Johnson and KJ Miller’s Mented Cosmetics and the start of nude lipsticks over a bottle of wine; and finally</li>
<li>based on these 8 companies, a case study of Rooshy Roy's AVRAANI, and her natural skincare venture to create cultural connections through beauty.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Book </strong></p> The book is written in 3 parts.<ul>
<li>Part 1 contains the history of product development in the beauty industry. What is setting the stage for these 8 companies to form? What do we know about product offerings in the 90s?</li>
<li>Part 2 contains the profiles of women who founded these companies. What did the landscape of entrepreneurship look like in beauty? How did the women we are highlighting change the way products are developed in this industry?</li>
<li>Part 3 contains an analysis of where this industry is going. What are the lasting trends we are seeing in beauty? How can you, as a consumer, an investor, an innovator, or a content creator, get involved?</li>

I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:* Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family, and network. Please use #emotioncommotion and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so we can help amplify your efforts.* You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page* Please share my book to 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it.

<p>My name is Katie Sullivan, and for as long as I could remember, I've wanted
to go on a grand adventure. And here I am, publishing a book. It's been written
and edited. The print and e-book files are almost ready to be uploaded to their
respective homes, but I need you for the next step. All books need marketing,
and <i>Changelings</i> is no
different. For this adventure to reach its ultimate conclusion, I need to put
physical copies into the hands of those who need it: reviewers, libraries,
reading groups, local book stores - you name it, I want them to see
it. </p>
<p>Wait, you want to see it, too? Well, then you've come to the right
place, because this is where you can pre-order <i>Changelings, </i>whether you want an e-book, a signed print copy or a
special inscribed copy. This is also the place to reserve your very own ""Rebel,"" ""Pirate,"" or ""King/Queen"" t-shirt, bookmark, wristband and mug!</p>
<p>But, before I go on, let me introduce to the world of<i>Changelings: Into the Mist:</i></p>

<p><i>Changelings.</i></p>
<p><i>They were the descendants of Man and Fae. They walked between worlds –
as healers, mystics, even kings – but no more. He thought he was the last,
alone and lost, until the day he saw them.</i></p>

<p>They are Changelings, and they have magic in their blood – magic, which
will rekindle a centuries-old war that threatens to tear the very fabric of
time.</p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The marketing campaign will unfold in three steps – and all of it
depends on you. The basic goal is $750, which will purchase ISBNs in order to distribute
the print book through IngramSpark. These ISBNs will cover all of the print and
digital editions of <i>Changelings: Into the
Mist</i>, as well as its sequel, <i>The Coming
Storm</i>. Of that $750, I will also be able to do an expanded print run
through IngramSpark, which will allow me to put review copies into the hands of
groups such as, the Midwest Book Review, offer distribution discounts to local
bookstores and place ads in online marketplaces, such as the Independent Author
Network. </p>
<p>Should the campaign go over its goal, and I’m hoping it does, I will be
able to expand its marketing reach. At $1,200 I will be able to apply for a
Kirkus Review. At $1,700 I will be able to put it into Publisher’s Weekly
Booklife and BookBub, and so on.</p>
<p>But enough about what I get to do – here is what your dollar is going to
get YOU:</p>
<p>Ebooks and physical copies, profuse thanks, t-shirts, a tablet cover,
bookmarks, a poster and a fabulous mug – all of which is divided out into the
perks outlined at the right.</p>
<p>If the gods are unkind, and I do not meet my campaign goal, I will use
whatever funds are raised to purchase the ISBNs needed to distribute the book
through IngramSpark. Fewer copies of the book will be printed through
CreateSpace to minimize costs, and whatever is left over will be used to
purchase ad space.</p>
<p><b>Why Changelings?</b></p>
<p>When I was growing up, I always wanted to read an adventure story – with
some romance, true, but a story that was fun, a story that told me about
different places, times and cultures. <i>Changelings</i>,
which takes its characters on a grand adventure on Grace O’Malley’s pirate
galley in 1584 and the streets of Dublin during the 1916 Rising, is that story
– it is an adventure for young women. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The risks with this project are few. The book has been written and
edited. The cover has been designed and uploaded. Not only that, but all
parties involved to-date have been paid for their services. Everything is ready
to go and this campaign will provide the additional means necessary to expand

I am currently working on my first book of poems and lyric essays, <i>Connective Tissue</i>; in it, I hope to recreate in language what my body lacks in material by weaving together personal narrative with scientific research, observations of the natural world, and elements of place. </p><p>This campaign will allow me to spend six weeks working intensively on <i>Connective Tissue</i> in July and August of this year. After two years of research and writing, two writer’s residencies, one successful <a href=""http://www.gofundme.com/47qplk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">crowdfunding campaign</a>, and ongoing support from my community, I have honed my vision for the project and drafted a quarter of the book’s poems.

<p>
</p><h4><b>How a successful campaign will support my book</b></h4><p>During a two-week residency at the Andrews Forest in Blue River, OR, this past March, I had a breakthrough regarding the structure of my book. I set aside the 20-30 pages of material I had already written to work on new poems based on my vision; for the first time, I began to feel comfortable telling people I am working on a book, not just a project or collection of separate pieces.</p><p>Since returning from that beautiful little writing apartment in the Pacific Northwest, I have continued to work on <i>Connective Tissue</i> in its new form. I now have nearly 20 pages of (new) poems for the book, which is something like a quarter of the finished manuscript. These poems feel meaty and powerful, and markedly different from earlier poems associated with this project. They feel riskier, more honest, more innovative, more intimate. I believe in them.</p><p>This fall, I will be become a Creative Writing MFA candidate at the University of Minnesota. Before my degree begins, I intend to maintain the momentum my project has gathered in the past year. This campaign will act like a crowdfunded residency, allowing me to work on my book from home for a set period of time. At this stage in the middle of the book’s development, I do not need to pay for travel or research: a successful campaign means that I will be able to focus my time and energy on writing. </p>
<p>As so many artists know, works made in different periods of our lives can contrast each other
dramatically. I have the opportunity, now, to offer my unwavering attention to <i>Connective Tissue </i>before I re-enter the
world of academia and begin taking classes, teaching, reading new works, trying
new things, and falling in love with new project ideas. </p><p>This campaign will also allow me to apply for future funding opportunities for the summer of 2015. Many grants, residencies, fellowships, and contests require application fees, and have deadlines six months or more in advance of the opportunities they provide. If I can secure funding for next summer, I expect to complete a full manuscript of <i>Connective Tissue </i>by the end of 2015. <b>If I exceed my goal for this campaign, I will use the additional funds to support a summer of writing in 2015. </b>If I do not reach my goal, I will adjust the amount of time I spend writing this July and August (i.e. four weeks instead of six), and seek additional income. </p><h4><b>How a successful campaign will impact others</b></h4><p>This book of poems found its roots in a very personal experience: my relationship to my body in the presence of a chronic illness. When this project was just a tiny seed and a few scribbles in a notebook, I gained courage and support from finding the voices of others who spoke out authentically about their lives, whether in writing, speech, artwork, or performance. It is my hope that <i>Connective Tissue</i> will be not only a book of poems, but a document that encourages others to write openly about disability, illness, sexuality, and the body. EDS is a rare condition, and since I have not found many writers or artists whose work publicly addresses it, I would like my writing to be available to others who want to see themselves reflected in art and literature. I also believe that many of the themes in <i>Connective Tissue </i>are universal and will speak to those who have a wide range of backgrounds.</p><p>Simply, I hope that this campaign and the eventual publication of my book will raise awareness about EDS and other chronic conditions. I will donate 10% of the funds raised during this campaign to the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation (EDNF) Center for Clinical Care and Research, which will be the first Center of its kind and is set to open in August 2014 in Baltimore. You can read more about the Center <u><a href=""http://www.ednf.org/ednf-center-clinical-care-research"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a></u>.<br/></p><p></p><h3><b>Past Support for<i> Connective Tissue</i></b></h3><p>As a potential backer, you’ll want to know that <i>Connective Tissue</i> has
other supporters, and that I have consistently sought and received funding from a variety of sources. And I have! Here’s the rundown:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<b>$350 grant</b> from the Pabst Cultural Endowment Scholarship Fund, which covered partial tuition fees for Residency #151 at the Atlantic Center for the Arts (Summer 2013)</li>
<li>
<b>$1,005 in crowdfunding donations</b> from 16 donors via GoFundMe, which covered partial tuition fees, travel and other costs associated with Residency #151 at the Atlantic Center for the Arts (Fall 2013)</li>
<li>
<b>$250 honorarium</b> from Oregon State University, which offset travel, food, and other costs associated with a 2-week residency at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest (Spring 2014)</li>
<li>
<b>My poems have been published</b> in Make/shift magazine, Our Lives Magazine, and the Helen Burns Poetry Anthology of New Voices from the Academy of American Poets College Prizes </li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Additionally, I have committed to spending the next three years as an MFA candidate at the the University of Minnesota–Twin Cities, which reflects my dedication to the written word.

<p></p></div>","Connective Tissue, a book of poems
I am a poet and essayist whose work explores illness, disability, the body, the natural world, and the complex web of relationships of which we are all a part. I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), a genetic connective tissue disorder that affects the body's collagen, which means that I have less glue holding my joints, muscles, and other tissues together than others do. I am currently working on my first book of poems and lyric essays, Connective Tissue; in it, I hope to recreate in language what my body lacks in material by weaving together personal narrative with scientific research, observations of the natural world, and elements of place. This campaign will allow me to spend six weeks working intensively on Connective Tissue in July and August of this year. After two years of research and writing, two writer’s residencies, one successful crowdfunding campaign, and ongoing support from my community, I have honed my vision for the project and drafted a quarter of the book’s poems. With your help, I can focus intensively on Connective Tissue before switching gears to begin my graduate degree this September. In honor of my relationship with EDS, I will donate 10% of all funds raised to the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation (ENDF) for continued care and research for individuals affected by EDS. 
How I'll use the funds
With your help, I hope to raise $3,000 in 30 days. Below is a breakdown of how I'll use the funds. [The image above is a color-coded sketch of the bones in the human hand to show the use of campaign funds. Most of the bones are light blue, representing $2,400 for 6 weeks of income replacement; the thumb bones and metacarpal are pink, representing a $300 donation (or 10% of total) to EDNF; two carpals are orange, representing $200 in fundraising fees; one carpal is green, representing $100 in submission fees for contests, residencies, and grants.]
Income replacement
for 6 weeks in July-Aug 2014: $2,400
Income replacement means that I can spend July and August writing without worrying about how to cover basic expenses. The estimate is based
on what I would have made in 6 weeks at my most recent full-time job at a magazine.

Fees for submissions
& future residencies: $100
By submitting my work to contests, publications, and future residencies (many of which have application fees), I can ensure that I will
have the resources I need to work on the book in the summer of 2015. 

10% to EDNF
Center for Clinical Care and Research: $300 

The Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation (EDNF) is in the process of creating the first Center for Clinical Care and Research, which will open this year in
Baltimore. I will donate 10% of the funds I raise to EDNF, earmarked for the Center. 

Crowdfunding fees: $200
Indiegogo takes a percentage of the funds raised on their site, with additional payment processing fees. Please help me keep these costs down by spreading the word and sharing this page. Every dollar counts!

How a successful campaign will support my bookDuring a two-week residency at the Andrews Forest in Blue River, OR, this past March, I had a breakthrough regarding the structure of my book. I set aside the 20-30 pages of material I had already written to work on new poems based on my vision; for the first time, I began to feel comfortable telling people I am working on a book, not just a project or collection of separate pieces.Since returning from that beautiful little writing apartment in the Pacific Northwest, I have continued to work on Connective Tissue in its new form. I now have nearly 20 pages of (new) poems for the book, which is something like a quarter of the finished manuscript. These poems feel meaty and powerful, and markedly different from earlier poems associated with this project. They feel riskier, more honest, more innovative, more intimate. I believe in them.This fall, I will be become a Creative Writing MFA candidate at the University of Minnesota. Before my degree begins, I intend to maintain the momentum my project has gathered in the past year. This campaign will act like a crowdfunded residency, allowing me to work on my book from home for a set period of time. At this stage in the middle of the book’s development, I do not need to pay for travel or research: a successful campaign means that I will be able to focus my time and energy on writing. 
As so many artists know, works made in different periods of our lives can contrast each other
dramatically. I have the opportunity, now, to offer my unwavering attention to Connective Tissue before I re-enter the
world of academia and begin taking classes, teaching, reading new works, trying
new things, and falling in love with new project ideas. This campaign will also allow me to apply for future funding opportunities for the summer of 2015. Many grants, residencies, fellowships, and contests require application fees, and have deadlines six months or more in advance of the opportunities they provide. If I can secure funding for next summer, I expect to complete a full manuscript of Connective Tissue by the end of 2015. If I exceed my goal for this campaign, I will use the additional funds to support a summer of writing in 2015. If I do not reach my goal, I will adjust the amount of time I spend writing this July and August (i.e. four weeks instead of six), and seek additional income. How a successful campaign will impact othersThis book of poems found its roots in a very personal experience: my relationship to my body in the presence of a chronic illness. When this project was just a tiny seed and a few scribbles in a notebook, I gained courage and support from finding the voices of others who spoke out authentically about their lives, whether in writing, speech, artwork, or performance. It is my hope that Connective Tissue will be not only a book of poems, but a document that encourages others to write openly about disability, illness, sexuality, and the body. EDS is a rare condition, and since I have not found many writers or artists whose work publicly addresses it, I would like my writing to be available to others who want to see themselves reflected in art and literature. I also believe that many of the themes in Connective Tissue are universal and will speak to those who have a wide range of backgrounds.Simply, I hope that this campaign and the eventual publication of my book will raise awareness about EDS and other chronic conditions. I will donate 10% of the funds raised during this campaign to the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation (EDNF) Center for Clinical Care and Research, which will be the first Center of its kind and is set to open in August 2014 in Baltimore. You can read more about the Center here.Past Support for Connective TissueAs a potential backer, you’ll want to know that Connective Tissue has
other supporters, and that I have consistently sought and received funding from a variety of sources. And I have! Here’s the rundown:

$350 grant from the Pabst Cultural Endowment Scholarship Fund, which covered partial tuition fees for Residency #151 at the Atlantic Center for the Arts (Summer 2013)

$1,005 in crowdfunding donations from 16 donors via GoFundMe, which covered partial tuition fees, travel and other costs associated with Residency #151 at the Atlantic Center for the Arts (Fall 2013)

$250 honorarium from Oregon State University, which offset travel, food, and other costs associated with a 2-week residency at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest (Spring 2014)

My poems have been published in Make/shift magazine, Our Lives Magazine, and the Helen Burns Poetry Anthology of New Voices from the Academy of American Poets College Prizes 

Additionally, I have committed to spending the next three years as an MFA candidate at the the University of Minnesota–Twin Cities, which reflects my dedication to the written word. Interested in reading some of my work and getting to know me?

<em>Coming To: </em>the History</h3>
<p>I wrote my first poem at 9 years old: a piece describing how the sun broke through the clouds. The rays cascading to the field below were the most beautiful sight I'd seen.</p>
<p>As an adult, I use writing to break through my own overcast days. I spend my time writing, performing, and teaching. I have cultivated a deep spiritual practice, grounded in the land, and earned a Life Coaching certification. Like coaching, writing is a tool to dig deeply into oneself- to grow roots in the holes one leaves open. I do this work because I believe self knowledge and expression are human rights. They are healing. They are unifying. They are survival.</p>
<p><em>Coming To</em> is a story of how I survived. It is a series of poems around community, family history, sexuality, and relationships. I wrote these poems when I was just <em>coming to</em> see how I related with the world- in both beautiful and ugly ways. These poems show how I sorted those parts of myself I wanted to keep from those I wished to transform. </p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you will birth <em>Coming To.</em> I have already recorded and mastered the album. I need your help to bring it to the world with the beauty and celebration it deserves, includng: cover art, cds, online sales, and a release party. Excess funds will serve as seeder money for my forthcoming book <em>Place Making </em>(the sequel to <em>Coming To). </em><em> </em></p>

<h3>Hello there</h3>
<div><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Many people have seen the Grand Canyon from the bottom, but have you ever watched a one-armed man climb it with no ropes?</span></div>
<div>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our book, Conuqering the Great Unknown, will bring you to the time when that happened.</span><br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We will need $4,900 to make this project come to life. That money will cover the expenses already accrued by the author and illustrator on their first trip to see the sights near the beginning of Powell's expedition. The illustrator will return to see the sights that are only visible by water. The illustrator also needs to finish the last part of Powell's trip, which will include hikes and travel to the locations.</li>
<li>Donations will also cover self-publishing costs for both e-publishing and printed publishing.</li>
<li>We would like to pay the cast and at least get Dusty that smoothie he wants. So if we get extra funds, we will cut a check to our actors. If we get enough extra, we will use the rest in our marketing budget.</li>
<li>We thank all our donors, no matter how big or small. We couldn't do it without you. Large contributors ($300 or more) will get their names in the acknowledgements section.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><ul>
<li>When the author and illustrator were exploring on their first trip, they saw a trend. While there are books out there about Powell and his journeys down the Green and Colorado Rivers, none of the other books have portrayed the action-packed scenes in fiction. The author has chosen to alternate between fiction and non-fiction to bring the readers on the journey personally. In addition, the illustrator has chosen to use actors to portray some of the crew and make the scenes come to life.</li>
<li>Six of the ten crew members were veterans, three of which were wounded in the war. Their example proves that the impossible can still be achieved no matter what the obstacle.</li>
<li>As a conservationist, geologist, environmentalist, explorer and professor, John Wesley Powell understood settling the West was going to be very different from the eastern half of the United States, and through his affiliations with such organizations as the Bureau of Ethnicity and the United States Geological Survey, he rallied the government to be mindful of the shortage of resources west of the Rockies. Although his efforts accomplished very little, he is an example for environmentalists to continue his mission.</li>
</ul></div>

<h3>Buzz About our Book</h3>
<div>Here's the buzz about our book from people who have read the draft so far:</div>
<div>
<p>This dynamic duo are retracing the footsteps of explorer John Wesley Powell, whose historic journey down the Colorado River in 1869 made him an American hero. With stunning photographs and lively, well-researched text, this book promises to be a must-have title for those readers interested in the exploration of the American West.</p>
<p>--- Shirley Raye Redmond, author of <b><i>Stone of the Sun</i></b></p>
<p>With my middle school education background, I was interested in reading a book that combined an historic adventure on the wild rivers of the western United States with the coming-of-age story of a young boy looking to find himself. This exciting book tells the tale of the travels of the great explorer John Wesley Powell down the wild Green River and Colorado River through modern eyes. The story weaves the present and past expertly to create a fresh view of an American hero.</p>

<h3>Transcription</h3>
</div>
<p>Hi I'm Angela Reuben, and when I was <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">reading about the Battle of Shiloh </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">during the Civil War, I came across </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">a Major who had to have his arm </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">amputated because he had gotten shot </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">in the arm.</span></p>
<p>Back then, of course, they didn't <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">have artificial limbs like they do </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">today, so I was wondering... what </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">did he do after the war? He couldn't </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">pull his own boots on anymore and he </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">couldn't button up his own shirt, so </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">what did he do?</span></p>
<p>I started researching him and I <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">found out he did some really </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">interesting things: he scaled cliffs </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">2000 feet high with no ropes. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">He led an expedition down some </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">really wicked rapids without being </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">able to row.</span></p>
<p>His story was so fascinating that <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">not only did I research it more, but </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I decided I needed to write about </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">him.</span></p>
<p>In my book, Conquering the Great <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Unknown, you're going to meet John </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Wesley Powell, who was an </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">intelligent, high-spirited man, a </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">geologist, university professor, and </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">you're going to meet his crew.</span></p>
<p>Dusty Williams is an actor and model <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">who will be portraying John Wesley </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Powell in the illustrations for my </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">book.</span></p>
<p>Angela: Dusty, what drew you to play <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">the part of John Wesley Powell?</span></p>
<p>Dusty: I think in my own life, and I <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">think a lot of people within my age </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">category find themselves sort of </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">intimidated by life and the enormity </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">of having to make something of </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">yourself -- the enormity of the </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">mountain in front of you. And then </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">hearing about this guy who was a </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">professor, and scaled 2000 foot </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">mountains, and sailed down rivers </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">that he couldn't even row by </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">himself, with one arm, and did all </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">of this in the course of many </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">years...

Many people have seen the Grand Canyon from the bottom, but have you ever watched a one-armed man climb it with no ropes?

Our book, Conuqering the Great Unknown, will bring you to the time when that happened.



What We Need & What You Get

We will need $4,900 to make this project come to life. That money will cover the expenses already accrued by the author and illustrator on their first trip to see the sights near the beginning of Powell's expedition. The illustrator will return to see the sights that are only visible by water. The illustrator also needs to finish the last part of Powell's trip, which will include hikes and travel to the locations.
Donations will also cover self-publishing costs for both e-publishing and printed publishing.
We would like to pay the cast and at least get Dusty that smoothie he wants. So if we get extra funds, we will cut a check to our actors. If we get enough extra, we will use the rest in our marketing budget.
We thank all our donors, no matter how big or small. We couldn't do it without you. Large contributors ($300 or more) will get their names in the acknowledgements section.



The Impact

When the author and illustrator were exploring on their first trip, they saw a trend. While there are books out there about Powell and his journeys down the Green and Colorado Rivers, none of the other books have portrayed the action-packed scenes in fiction. The author has chosen to alternate between fiction and non-fiction to bring the readers on the journey personally. In addition, the illustrator has chosen to use actors to portray some of the crew and make the scenes come to life.
Six of the ten crew members were veterans, three of which were wounded in the war. Their example proves that the impossible can still be achieved no matter what the obstacle.
As a conservationist, geologist, environmentalist, explorer and professor, John Wesley Powell understood settling the West was going to be very different from the eastern half of the United States, and through his affiliations with such organizations as the Bureau of Ethnicity and the United States Geological Survey, he rallied the government to be mindful of the shortage of resources west of the Rockies. Although his efforts accomplished very little, he is an example for environmentalists to continue his mission.



Buzz About our Book
Here's the buzz about our book from people who have read the draft so far:

This dynamic duo are retracing the footsteps of explorer John Wesley Powell, whose historic journey down the Colorado River in 1869 made him an American hero. With stunning photographs and lively, well-researched text, this book promises to be a must-have title for those readers interested in the exploration of the American West.
--- Shirley Raye Redmond, author of Stone of the Sun
With my middle school education background, I was interested in reading a book that combined an historic adventure on the wild rivers of the western United States with the coming-of-age story of a young boy looking to find himself. This exciting book tells the tale of the travels of the great explorer John Wesley Powell down the wild Green River and Colorado River through modern eyes. The story weaves the present and past expertly to create a fresh view of an American hero.

Transcription

Hi I'm Angela Reuben, and when I was reading about the Battle of Shiloh during the Civil War, I came across a Major who had to have his arm amputated because he had gotten shot in the arm.
Back then, of course, they didn't have artificial limbs like they do today, so I was wondering... what did he do after the war? He couldn't pull his own boots on anymore and he couldn't button up his own shirt, so what did he do?
I started researching him and I found out he did some really interesting things: he scaled cliffs 2000 feet high with no ropes. He led an expedition down some really wicked rapids without being able to row.
His story was so fascinating that not only did I research it more, but I decided I needed to write about him.
In my book, Conquering the Great Unknown, you're going to meet John Wesley Powell, who was an intelligent, high-spirited man, a geologist, university professor, and you're going to meet his crew.
Dusty Williams is an actor and model who will be portraying John Wesley Powell in the illustrations for my book.
Angela: Dusty, what drew you to play the part of John Wesley Powell?
Dusty: I think in my own life, and I think a lot of people within my age category find themselves sort of intimidated by life and the enormity of having to make something of yourself -- the enormity of the mountain in front of you. And then hearing about this guy who was a professor, and scaled 2000 foot mountains, and sailed down rivers that he couldn't even row by himself, with one arm, and did all of this in the course of many years... I just find that really inspirational. I'm hoping that in playing him, some of that will rub off on me.
Angela: So what attracted you to the project besides the (sarcasm) great money that you will be making?
Dusty: (Laughing) Well surprisingly it wasn't actually the money. If donations happen to come in and I can afford to get myself a smoothie during shooting, that would be wonderful, but really it was the passion of the people involved. These are professional people, and they are so moved by this project that they are donating their time and their skills that they could otherwise be using to get themselves some smoothies. I really believed in supporting them. On a personal note, this is my first time as a sort of a chance to stretch my boundaries.
Angela: So Major Powell, why did you decide to take such a dangerous trip when you knew that nobody else who had tried it, had survived?
Powell: I just couldn't stand seeing those great big expanses labelled ""unknown"" on the map. I had to know what was out there. And I knew that having just one arm, I couldn't do it all by myself, so I got a fine crew to come with me. Who were the young men who risked their lives to explore with me? You'll have to read the book to find out. And how many of those fine young men paid the ultimate price on that trip? That's in there too.
Angela: So my dream is to tell the story of this famous journey in a little bit different way. A lot of people just use non-fiction, but I want to also bring in some of the more dynamic scenes as ""faction,""  which is facts told in a fictional way. I think that people will find that to be really enjoyable and it will stick in their minds. So that's why I teamed up with Dusty and the other actors and J Rae Chip Productions. Her photos are going to captivate your heart and soul. 
We're also going to include a map of the journey we took to take the photos so that you can go and follow our trip.
I'm hoping that my book will inspire wounded Veterans, geologists, explorers, historians, anybody over the age of 8 who likes to read, that they can follow their dreams. And no matter what rapids come into their life, that those things can be navigated and conquered. I appreciate any donations, and I look forward to seeing your comments when we get the book out.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>A couple of months ago, a Miami taxi driver came to my door.
He brought a dream with him: to publish his book.</p>
<p>This taxi driver had driven around Miami for 12 years during
night shifts.  He drove and wrote. Wrote
and drove. Until one day someone told him he would never make his dream a
reality if he continued working as a taxi driver.</p>
<p>He followed the advice, the bad advice, of selling his taxi
and using the funds to seek out a path that would allow him to fulfill his
dream. </p>
<p>This Writer-Taxi Driver had written all of his stories on
loose sheets, in notebooks, in whatever piece of paper he had at hand. But he
did not know anything about computers.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">He needed someone to help him transcribe all of these
stories, and to edit and organize them.</span><br/></p>

<p><b>EN ESPAÑOL</b></p>
<p>Esta campaña no se trata de la publicación
de otro libro. En realidad es más que eso. Se trata de ayudar a un taxista en
Miami a cumplir su sueño de ser un autor publicado.</p>
<p><b>¿De qué es el libro?</b></p>
<p>Cuentos y crónicas basadas en la vida real
de experiencias de un conductor de taxi en Miami.</p>
<p><b>La historia del libro</b></p>
<p>Hace un par de meses, un taxista de Miami
tocó a mi puerta.  Traía un sueño: publicar un libro.</p>
<p>Este taxista había conducido alrededor de
Miami durante doce años durante los turnos de noche. Manejaba y  escribía.
Escribía y manejaba . Hasta que un día alguien le dijo que nunca podría hacer
su sueño una realidad si continuaba trabajando como taxista .</p>
<p>Él siguió el consejo, o el mal consejo, de
vender su taxi y usó esos fondos para buscar un camino que le permitiera
cumplir su sueño.</p>
<p>Este Escritor Taxista había escrito todas
sus historias en hojas sueltas, en cuadernos, en cualquier trozo de papel que
tenía en la mano. Pero no sabía nada de ordenadores.</p>
<p>Necesitaba a alguien que le ayudara a
transcribir todas estas historias, editarlas y organizarlas.</p>
<p>Alguien (con buenas o malas intenciones)
 le cobró un montón de dinero por las transcripciones.</p>
<p>Vino a mí  casi sin dinero y con un
proyecto que aún no estaba listo para su publicación.</p>
<p>Eriginal Books financió totalmente la
corrección, edición, diseño de la portada y el diseño del libro .</p>
<p>¿Qué falta ahora? Algunos fondos
adicionales para los gastos de impresión del libro.</p>
<p><b>¿Quién es el autor ?</b></p>
<p>El autor no quiso revelar su nombre.
Firmará con seudónimo: El Escritor Taxista .</p>
<p>¿Por qué? Muchas personas no creen en él.
Creo que quiere que la obra hable por sí misma.</p>
<p><b>¿Qué es Eriginal Books ?</b></p>
<p>ERIGINAL BOOKS es una editorial
especializada en literatura hispana .</p>
<p>ERIGINAL BOOKS no es una editorial clásica.
Es un agente cultural del siglo 21 que está en constante evolución y
experimentación con las expectativas de la industria.</p>
<p>Su misión es promover autores y culturas
hispanas en el nuevo mundo digital.</p>
<p>¿Por qué es Eriginal Books diferente a otra
casa editorial?</p>
<p>• Publicamos y promovemos la obra de
autores nuevos e independientes.</p>
<p>• Creemos que todo escritor debe tener la
oportunidad de ser publicado, al mismo tiempo que el lector tiene derecho a
leer su trabajo bien editado.</p>
<p>• Creemos que las casas editoriales tienen
que cambiar la forma en que concibieron su papel en la industria del libro.</p>
<p>• Queremos que los autores mantengan el
control total y los derechos sobre su obra.</p>
<p><b>¿Qué necesitamos y que obtienes?</b></p>
<p>Este libro no se basará únicamente en sus contribuciones.
Estamos en esto juntos.</p>
<p>Eriginal Books ha financiado la corrección,
edición, diseño de la portada y el diseño del libro. Lo que necesitamos ahora
son algunos fondos adicionales para cubrir los costos de impresión del libro.</p>
<p><b>¿Cómo se utilizarán los fondos?</b></p>
<p>• Alrededor del 70 % cubrirá los costos de
impresión y</p>
<p>• El 30% restante cubrirá los honorarios
IndieGoGo y el envío de libros .</p>
<p><b>Otras formas de ayudar</b></p>
<p>¡La ayuda no es sólo cuestión de dinero!
Algunas personas pueden no tener los medios para contribuir financieramente,
pero aún así pueden ayudar:</p>
<p>•  Pidale a sus amigos que ayuden
a  correr la voz y hagan un poco de ruido de esta campaña .</p>

</div></div>","What is the book about?Short stories and chronicles based on the real life experiences
of a taxi driver in Miami.
The story of the book
A couple of months ago, a Miami taxi driver came to my door.
He brought a dream with him: to publish his book.
This taxi driver had driven around Miami for 12 years during
night shifts.  He drove and wrote. Wrote
and drove. Until one day someone told him he would never make his dream a
reality if he continued working as a taxi driver.
He followed the advice, the bad advice, of selling his taxi
and using the funds to seek out a path that would allow him to fulfill his
dream. 
This Writer-Taxi Driver had written all of his stories on
loose sheets, in notebooks, in whatever piece of paper he had at hand. But he
did not know anything about computers.
He needed someone to help him transcribe all of these
stories, and to edit and organize them.
Ad posted for the Writer-Taxi Driver in newspaper Diario Las Americas.  “I need a grammar teacher to type out manuscript
to a computer hard drive”.Someone (with good or bad intentions) charged him a lot of
money for a transcription.
He came to me when he had nearly run out of the money he got
from the sale of his cab, and with a draft that was still not ready for
publication.
Eriginal Books fully funded the correction, editing, cover
design and layout of his book.
What is still missing? Some additional funds for the
printing costs of the book.
Kobe Bryant encouraged the Writer Taxi Driver to finish his
book and gave him his autograph. 
Who is the author?
The author does not want to reveal his name yet.  He will sign with a pseudonym: The Writer-Taxi
Driver.
Why? Many people don´t believe in him. I think he wants the
work to speak for itself.
What is Eriginal Books?
ERIGINAL BOOKS is a
publishing house specialized in Hispanic literature. 
ERIGINAL
BOOKS IS not a classic publisher; it is a cultural agent of the 21st
century that is constantly evolving and experiment with industry expectations. 
Its
mission is to promote Hispanic authors and cultures in the new digital world.
Why
is Eriginal Books a different kind of publisher?


We publish and promote
the work of new and independent authors.


We think that any
writer should have the opportunity to be published, just as much as the reader
has the right to read their well-edited work.


We believe that
publishers have to change the way they envisioned their traditional role in the
publishing industry


We want the authors to
keep full control and rights over their work.


What We Need & What You Get
This book will not rely solely on your contributions. We are in this together.
Eriginal Books has already fully funded the correction,
editing, cover design and layout of the book. 
What we need now are some additional funds to cover the printing costs
of the book.
How will the funds be used?


About 70% will cover the print
costs; and


The other 30% will cover Indiegogo
fees and the shipping of books to our supporters.


Other ways you can
help
Support isn’t just about money! Some people may not have the
means to contribute any money, but they can still help out:


Ask your friends to get the word out and make
some noise about this campaign.


Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools and any other sharing platform you can think of!


Thank you all so much!
Who are we?

EN ESPAÑOL
Esta campaña no se trata de la publicación
de otro libro. En realidad es más que eso. Se trata de ayudar a un taxista en
Miami a cumplir su sueño de ser un autor publicado.
¿De qué es el libro?
Cuentos y crónicas basadas en la vida real
de experiencias de un conductor de taxi en Miami.
La historia del libro
Hace un par de meses, un taxista de Miami
tocó a mi puerta.  Traía un sueño: publicar un libro.
Este taxista había conducido alrededor de
Miami durante doce años durante los turnos de noche. Manejaba y  escribía.
Escribía y manejaba . Hasta que un día alguien le dijo que nunca podría hacer
su sueño una realidad si continuaba trabajando como taxista .
Él siguió el consejo, o el mal consejo, de
vender su taxi y usó esos fondos para buscar un camino que le permitiera
cumplir su sueño.
Este Escritor Taxista había escrito todas
sus historias en hojas sueltas, en cuadernos, en cualquier trozo de papel que
tenía en la mano. Pero no sabía nada de ordenadores.
Necesitaba a alguien que le ayudara a
transcribir todas estas historias, editarlas y organizarlas.
Alguien (con buenas o malas intenciones)
 le cobró un montón de dinero por las transcripciones.
Vino a mí  casi sin dinero y con un
proyecto que aún no estaba listo para su publicación.
Eriginal Books financió totalmente la
corrección, edición, diseño de la portada y el diseño del libro .
¿Qué falta ahora? Algunos fondos
adicionales para los gastos de impresión del libro.
¿Quién es el autor ?
El autor no quiso revelar su nombre.
Firmará con seudónimo: El Escritor Taxista .
¿Por qué? Muchas personas no creen en él.
Creo que quiere que la obra hable por sí misma.
¿Qué es Eriginal Books ?
ERIGINAL BOOKS es una editorial
especializada en literatura hispana .
ERIGINAL BOOKS no es una editorial clásica.
Es un agente cultural del siglo 21 que está en constante evolución y
experimentación con las expectativas de la industria.
Su misión es promover autores y culturas
hispanas en el nuevo mundo digital.
¿Por qué es Eriginal Books diferente a otra
casa editorial?
• Publicamos y promovemos la obra de
autores nuevos e independientes.
• Creemos que todo escritor debe tener la
oportunidad de ser publicado, al mismo tiempo que el lector tiene derecho a
leer su trabajo bien editado.
• Creemos que las casas editoriales tienen
que cambiar la forma en que concibieron su papel en la industria del libro.
• Queremos que los autores mantengan el
control total y los derechos sobre su obra.
¿Qué necesitamos y que obtienes?
Este libro no se basará únicamente en sus contribuciones.
Estamos en esto juntos.
Eriginal Books ha financiado la corrección,
edición, diseño de la portada y el diseño del libro. Lo que necesitamos ahora
son algunos fondos adicionales para cubrir los costos de impresión del libro.
¿Cómo se utilizarán los fondos?
• Alrededor del 70 % cubrirá los costos de
impresión y
• El 30% restante cubrirá los honorarios
IndieGoGo y el envío de libros .
Otras formas de ayudar
¡La ayuda no es sólo cuestión de dinero!
Algunas personas pueden no tener los medios para contribuir financieramente,
pero aún así pueden ayudar:
•  Pidale a sus amigos que ayuden
a  correr la voz y hagan un poco de ruido de esta campaña .
• Recuérdeles utilizar las herramientas de
participación IndieGoGo y cualquier otra plataforma de intercambio que pueda
imaginar !

with Roberto Bolano’s <i>2666</i> folded
over my lap. The cicadas from beyond the mesquites that ensconced my yard
slowly began to call in their disconnected chirps until they found each other
and harmonized in a tangle of abrasive little bellows that rose and fell like
city sirens. As I continued to read, a subtle a wave of recognition entered my
thoughts—barely perceptible at first, more akin to awareness than any tangible
idea. It gradually matured from a hint of suggestion into palpable
understanding. Questions began to formulate. What truly is literature? What is
the basis for a masterpiece?  What is the
inextricable relationship between reader and author? I became fascinated by the
tenuous bonds of literary understanding, reinforced each time a person opened a
book and continued to turn the page.</p>

 My epiphany was the subtle recognition in the potential
power of literature. It wasn't the kind of dumbfounding moment where the
heavens open up as the sun cuts through the sky, pushing through the clouds of
uncertainty. It was much more modest and easily missed. A piqued interest moved
me to seek out additional works. I began a personal journey, blindly navigating
the literary landscape. Unguided, I stumbled through the great works, fumbling
for knowledge. Moved by Hugo’s detailed characterizations, Tolstoy’s epic
historical landscapes, and Hemingway’s penchant for brevity and subtext, I
decided to pursue scholarship formally. <br/><p></p><p></p><h3>Inspired but what did I do about it?</h3><p></p><p>Those of you close to me know that I am currently enrolled in a graduate English Studies program at the University of Texas at Brownsville.

<p>Five
years ago I was devastated when my best friend, business partner, and god father of my children left the country with millions of dollars from the sale of a business that we started.<br/><br/>""How could I have been so blind and so stupid"", I asked myself as I ridiculed the tears falling from my eyes again. I found
myself over and over again sitting on the side of my bed searching for the suicide clause in the
insurance policy and the courage to take action.</p>
<p>This time I was going to do it.  I was going to make sure my family was taken care of in my absence but first I wanted to say good-bye.</p><p>One
of my final good-byes led me to speak with a close friend and psychotherapist
that explained how I lost who I was.  During our conversation he sent me
on a journey;  ""You must find your confidence again, your power, and
your influence.  You have to get your MOJO back and then share the secret
of getting it with the world.""</p>
<p>Did
he recognize my distress?  Did he know this was good-bye?  </p><p>I don’t
know what his perception of me was at that moment, but he planted a seed that
as it grew it perplexed my mind. </p><p>For the first time in month, I could not sleep - but not because of depression - I could not sleep because my thoughts were
consumed with the fountain of MOJO; that magical elixir that gives the caster
to power to influence the world with a confidence that is unstoppable.
 <br/><br/>""What if I could find it?”  I
thought.  ""What if it's out there
and I could help others find theirs?""</p>
<p>Five
years later with thousands of case studies completed and a manuscript near
completion I need a little help reaching the finish line.<br/><br/>I learned that there are two elements of mojo - unstoppable confidence and powerful influence.  I discovered that incongruence kills influence and doubt destroys confidence.  </p><p>I discovered that MOJO can be powerful for good or for evil.  The point is that everyone has some - they just need to tap into it.</p><p>As the research grew and my knowledge increased I became a Mojo Wielding Maven.  I could barely see the broken pieces of me any more... and what's more - I had helped thousands of people tap into thier inner power!  The MOJO FORMULA was complete and I was like a mad scientist.</p><p>Now I just need to get it into the hands of the people that need it the most. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>Who am I?</b> </p><p>My name is <b>Dawnna St Louis</b> and I have been traveling, lecturing, and sharing the Science of Mojo for several years. </p><p>As I mentioned, I have been compiling data and stories for this book for five years and it has been a wonderful life changing - no - life saving challenge!  It is a journey from confidence interrupted to mojo found and the secret formula I discovered in the middle.</p><p>The book is multi-layered with stories from my life and my first glimpses at Mojo. Through my passage through the experience of loss in my life, I am able to share the real and seemingly real ways that we have all seen mojo in action, how we react to it, and how we can acquire, increase, and wield mojo as a superpower in our personal, private, and professional lives.</p><p><i>The Science of Mojo</i> speaks to every woman that did not feel the power to speak up and regretted it, to every man that wanted the courage to talk to the prettiest girl in the room but didn't because he thought he wasn’t good enough, and to every person that wants to be a leader but refrains from stepping out of the dark and taking a stand in their spotlight.  This book was written for the people that say, ""I wanted to, but..."" or,  ""What if I can't,""  or, ""I should have.”</p><p>This book is written for the people that want to move past a moment of doubt into a lifetime of doing. </p><p>Here are the chapters:</p><p>Chapter 1  Confidence Interrupted<br/>Chapter 2  Power And Influence<br/>Chapter 3  Wielding A Superpower<br/>Chapter 4  The Warning Label<br/>Chapter 5  The Sunny Side Of The Road<br/>Chapter 6  Changing Your Mind<br/>Chapter 7  The Elements Of Mojo<br/>Chapter 8  Your  Mojo Factor<br/>Chapter 9  Your Unstoppable Confidence<br/>Chapter 10 Powerful Influence<br/>Chapter 11 Mojo Kryptonite<br/>Chapter 12 Feeding Your Mojo<br/>Chapter 13 The Mojo Elixir</p><br/><p><b><br/>Bryant's Case Study</b></p><p><br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DV1KzVJtq5-8&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><br/><br/><p></p>

<p></p></div>","Only 5 years later...
Five
years ago I was devastated when my best friend, business partner, and god father of my children left the country with millions of dollars from the sale of a business that we started.""How could I have been so blind and so stupid"", I asked myself as I ridiculed the tears falling from my eyes again. I found
myself over and over again sitting on the side of my bed searching for the suicide clause in the
insurance policy and the courage to take action.
This time I was going to do it.  I was going to make sure my family was taken care of in my absence but first I wanted to say good-bye.One
of my final good-byes led me to speak with a close friend and psychotherapist
that explained how I lost who I was.  During our conversation he sent me
on a journey;  ""You must find your confidence again, your power, and
your influence.  You have to get your MOJO back and then share the secret
of getting it with the world.""
Did
he recognize my distress?  Did he know this was good-bye?  I don’t
know what his perception of me was at that moment, but he planted a seed that
as it grew it perplexed my mind. For the first time in month, I could not sleep - but not because of depression - I could not sleep because my thoughts were
consumed with the fountain of MOJO; that magical elixir that gives the caster
to power to influence the world with a confidence that is unstoppable.
 ""What if I could find it?”  I
thought.  ""What if it's out there
and I could help others find theirs?""
Five
years later with thousands of case studies completed and a manuscript near
completion I need a little help reaching the finish line.I learned that there are two elements of mojo - unstoppable confidence and powerful influence.  I discovered that incongruence kills influence and doubt destroys confidence.  I discovered that MOJO can be powerful for good or for evil.  The point is that everyone has some - they just need to tap into it.As the research grew and my knowledge increased I became a Mojo Wielding Maven.  I could barely see the broken pieces of me any more... and what's more - I had helped thousands of people tap into thier inner power!  The MOJO FORMULA was complete and I was like a mad scientist.Now I just need to get it into the hands of the people that need it the most. Who am I? My name is Dawnna St Louis and I have been traveling, lecturing, and sharing the Science of Mojo for several years. As I mentioned, I have been compiling data and stories for this book for five years and it has been a wonderful life changing - no - life saving challenge!  It is a journey from confidence interrupted to mojo found and the secret formula I discovered in the middle.The book is multi-layered with stories from my life and my first glimpses at Mojo. Through my passage through the experience of loss in my life, I am able to share the real and seemingly real ways that we have all seen mojo in action, how we react to it, and how we can acquire, increase, and wield mojo as a superpower in our personal, private, and professional lives.The Science of Mojo speaks to every woman that did not feel the power to speak up and regretted it, to every man that wanted the courage to talk to the prettiest girl in the room but didn't because he thought he wasn’t good enough, and to every person that wants to be a leader but refrains from stepping out of the dark and taking a stand in their spotlight.  This book was written for the people that say, ""I wanted to, but..."" or,  ""What if I can't,""  or, ""I should have.”This book is written for the people that want to move past a moment of doubt into a lifetime of doing. Here are the chapters:Chapter 1  Confidence InterruptedChapter 2  Power And InfluenceChapter 3  Wielding A SuperpowerChapter 4  The Warning LabelChapter 5  The Sunny Side Of The RoadChapter 6  Changing Your MindChapter 7  The Elements Of MojoChapter 8  Your  Mojo FactorChapter 9  Your Unstoppable ConfidenceChapter 10 Powerful InfluenceChapter 11 Mojo KryptoniteChapter 12 Feeding Your MojoChapter 13 The Mojo ElixirBryant's Case Study

Actually, that’s Connor Luck, the main character in my upcoming book series that’s loosely based on the crazy things my friends and I talked about doing when we were in elementary and middle school.We definitely weren’t bad kids, but we were creative and loved to play pranks. I had forgotten about all of the crazy things we did until the night my 7 year old nephew spent the night.
He was glued to his books, laughing his head off and feverishly turning the pages.  I had to know what was so enthralling about his books, so I grabbed one and started reading.I found myself laughing and reminiscing about the things I did as kid and shared them with him. I even showed him a few of the harmless pranks we used to play on each other. The next day I had a new direction and new best friend, Connor Luck. Connor is my main character in a series of books for kids ages 7-12 that deal with things kids find funny, but also teaches them life lessons about friendship and bonds, bullying, science, safe fun and anything else we can dream up.I've already completed the first 11 of 14 chapters in book 1 and begun working with an illustrator to bring my concept of The Prankster's Club to digital and paper form.With your help, I can get there sooner and make my dream of becoming a full time author a reality. Together, we can bring Connor, Max, Milo, Molly(the teachers pet), Mr. Mooger(the principal) and Theodore Reginald Strong(a.k.a. T.Rex the Bully) to kids everywhere.How funding will helpOnce I sat down and began planning everything I needed to make my writing dream come true I quickly realized that being a writer and doing it the right way had expenses. Big expenses. This is no longer just a hobby, it's become my passion.Your donation will help:

<h3><b>PLAN</b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>I have cleared my schedule to focus on completing the
manuscript of the <i>Matrix of Sacred Speech</i>
in the next six months.  We will need 2 months of editing, so by July, 2014, I can start working with our translators for our editions in several languages.  The English Language edition will be ready for public release in September, 2014, while the other language editions by November, 2014.</p>
<h3><b>PERKS</b></h3>
<p>Everyone making any contribution of any kind will receive a personal ""thank you"" from me as well as my blessings.</p>
<p>My goal with the ""perks"" is to make them relevant to the principles of community and collaboration, to either include you in the creative process itself, or at least give you some special access, and a seat in the front row.  </p>
<p>Please check on the side bar for the levels of the perks.  Everyone participating in the perks will be receiving The Matrix of Sacred Speech about a month before public release, and you may have followed the conversation through updates on this page, or in newsletter, or personal contact with me.  So we may certainly have a conversation before the general public is involved.  As the perks move to higher levels, I want to be able to personalize the book for you, by signing it, and then be able to acknowledge your collaboration and generosity in the book itself, and be able to have personal contact with some of you over SKYPE.</p>
<p>Druvinka, the most exciting contemporary artist from Sri Lanka, is donating a painting, <i>""The Mother of Speech"" that</i> she has created exclusively for this book.  She is known for the multilayered story myth-scapes she creates on large canvasses.  She is making 16X16 Fine Art Prints of her painting, which she will number and sign for some of our supporters.</p>
<h3><b>Master Class</b></h3>
<p>Also listed among the perks, for those of you who would like to take collaboration further, I will conduct an on-line Master Class, in the form of an interactive webinar, dealing
with the subject or chapter that I am working on at the time. This will be once a week going on over 3 months. Besides allowing some supporters participation in discussions dealing with the actual content
going into the book, and ask their questions, it also gives me an opportunity
to know my audience better, and an insight into how to articulate the knowledge
I have to give you, so that it rings bells.  In this way, the audience
collaborates with me in a new way.  I have some important and valuable things
to tell you, and I want to make sure they get through.  The subject matter will differ at each get together, so missing a session won't disturb the sequence.</p>
<p><b>The Matrix of Sacred
Speech will be self published and translated into six other languages</b> (so
far) (German, Russian, Italian, French, Czech, and Serbian).  Those from countries for which
there will be a translation in their language will receive the translation as
well as the original English. </p>

<p></p>
<h2><b>Newly Added Perks:</b></h2>
<p><b>We have just received a donation of a collection of rare Indian Mythology Posters of Gods and Goddesses to be used as perks for The Matrix of Sacred Speech Project.</b></p>
<p><b>Included in the collection are a large number of litho prints of Raja Ravi Varma (1848-1906), who almost single handedly created the genre of Calendar Art. These are all originals whose age exceeds 40-50 years, in some cases, more.  The Ravi Varma prints are labeled as such.</b></p>

As an initiate, guru, and now lineage holder in India’s most

practices over the last 44 years in India are all part of an Oral Tradition passed down over the millenia from the voice of the guru to the ear of the disciple.  We personify Speech as Mother Goddess.  I am going to tell you a story of how Speech plays the determining role in our consciousness, in our experience of life, and in how we know ourselves.


“They praised Language as a powerful and benign Goddess               ever ready to bestow favors on Her devotees.”




Although I have been teaching and writing about Sacred
Speech since 1977, a number of recent events regarding our freedom and privacy of Speech (and thought) and the wholesale corruption of mass media, have made me feel
the urgency to share my knowledge and experience about the nature and
power of speech with a wider public.
My goal here is much
larger than the book.
I believe we are in a civilizational crisis, and at its very
core is that fact that our Speech has been diminished, our
languages are degrading, and along with this, the control of our own lives and
thoughts.  Philosophers, linguists, cognitive scientists and babas will all
agree that our knowledge and our experience is determined from our Speech.
My story requires that I tell you about the great masters of Sacred Speech in
ancient and medieval India, their lineages, their sublime teachings and practices, and how we may employ those teachings in our
lives today.
We will explore what a tradition is and how it works, how knowledge is obtained and passed down, storytelling, what a practice really means, and what constitutes authority.
We will explore how Sacred Speech is actually used, in a spiritual discipline, in ritual, in mantra and tantra, and in daily life, for the purposes of self knowledge as well as prosperity.



Since my goal here is to not only entertain you, but also give you tools for personal growth, we will examine many of the assumptions we bring into the study of the ""other"" (whether another culture, religion, or even gender), to free ourselves of those limitations, especially in these times in which our speech has been so compromised by mass media. 
We will also look at how mass media has affected our speech, the use of abstractions and euphemisms, Orwell's rules, and how we may reclaim our speech and our empowerment.
It’s employment leads to prosperity - in the ancient Vedic rituals, as well as in the modern IT revolution; but its misuse leads to political and economic manipulation of the public, as pointed out by Orwell, with disastrous results.


“...the very words in our mouths have become colonial subjectsimmigrating from mass media.” -- Baba Rampuri
The Matrix of Sacred Speech is not about the description and analysis of a particular language, even Sanskrit, but exploring the true nature and potentialities of language, emphasizing its role in effecting liberation;  that it may be used by my readers as magical formulae to employ in their lives, not only to be more successful, prosperous, and happy, but, to have real relationships, to increase perception and knowledge, and to do good things.

<p>My name is James W. Jesso and I am a writer exploring the edges realms of consciousness. I was raised in south-western Ontario by my Mother and Father: devout Christians of contrasting denominations<em>, </em>hailing from rural Newfoundland. As children, my younger sister and I were taught the cultural values passed down to them through generations, such as ""drugs are wrong""<em>.</em> Like all great stories of healing, it is often that which our protectors fear the most that inflict the deepest wounds. At the age of 23, I found myself living in Melbourne, Australia and swept along in a sea of destructive substance use, reckless lifestyle choices, and confusion. It is somewhat paradoxical that among the very same substances that presented the “problem”, I found a gateway to healing myself.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What’s This Campaign all about?</strong></p>
<p>In 2010 I began what would become a 13 month journey with the “magic” psilocybin mushroom that would lead me through the dark night of my soul, and out the other side, into personal healing and a sense of passionate direction like I had never known before. I found myself happy, confident, clean, passionate, with purpose, direction, and self-respect. Since then, I have been in the process of conceptualizing a paradigm for the psychedelic experience that merges the indigenous perspective of “sprit medicine” with the contemporary paradigm of science and psychology—a paradigm built off scholarly research, and rooted in personal experience.</p>
<p>Over the last three years I dedicated my life to a dream of sharing this story, and not only how, but why the psilocybin mushroom can help us effectively heal through our unconscious emotional wounds and cultivate true inner bravery. My soon to be self-published book, <strong><em>Decomposing The Shadow: Lessons from the Psilocybin Mushroom </em></strong>is the result of those three years.</p>
<p><br/> Yet <strong><em>Decomposing The Shadow</em></strong>is about much more than just psychedelic mushrooms. It explores the potentials of what the unacknowledged aspects of ourselves have to offer our personal growth. It is about facing our darkness to discover our courage and nourish the fertility that lay inherent in the often-avoided shadow.</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you are supporting my vision of softening the stigma surrounding this ancient sacrament, furthering academic investigation into mind philosophy, and enabling those who intend to explore the mushroom as a healing tool to do so safely, with an awareness of the potential risks and benefits. With the funds raised in this campaign, I will not only launch the first stages of releasing this book, but will also tour the west coast of Canada, sharing my vision of healing, through workshops and book readings across 5 major music festivals and 5 major cities.</p>
<p>I consider this book and this tour to be the next steps in my career and an expression of giving my deepest gift to the world. Thank you for helping me to achieve this.</p>

<p><strong>The Press Release</strong></p>
<p>As psychedelics re-enter the collective consciousness of the academic world, we are seeing a parallel resurgence of interest from the general public.  The broken stereotype of “flower-power hippies” -- left echoing from the late 60’s and early 70’s -- is dissolving away as the current generation of psychedelic enthusiasts continue to embody an increasingly sophisticated perspective. As humanity's understanding of the world evolves, so does today’s enthusiast's understanding of the existential implications of the psychedelic experience. We have come to further develop perspectives that are rooted in the exploring psychology, neurology, sociology and even the nature of reality itself -- perspectives that are inclusive and universal, yet also relevant to daily life.<strong> James W. Jesso, senior event coordinator for Evolver Calgary, presents this type of perspective in his new book, Decomposing The Shadow: Lessons from the Psilocybin Mushroom. </strong></p>
<p>After 3 years of active investigation into the “magic” of the psilocybin mushroom, Jesso is ready to share his findings with the public. <strong><em>Decomposing the Shadow: Lessons from the Psilocybin Mushroom</em>, has been drafted out of extensive study and hundreds of hours of direct personal experiences with the mushroom itself.</strong> His experiences have gone beyond just a scholarly vantage point, as Jesso says he has used psilocybin mushrooms to heal the emotional and psychological wounds he developed after a period of destructive substance use.</p>
<p>In discussing what lead him to write this book, Jesso says, “My personal experiences inspired me to do my best in turning the public perception of this medicine away from ‘party drug’ and into a tool for personal growth, self-awareness and psycho-spiritual healing.""</p>
<p><strong>Jesso explains that a self-guided practice with the mushroom has enabled him move through his self-deprecation and attain a “state of being” founded on self-confidence, passion and a sense of purpose in this world.</strong> Jesso may have found his way to navigate the darkness of life, but what does this mean for us?</p>
<p><strong><em>Decomposing The Shadow</em></strong><strong> is Jesso’s effort to accurately communicate the broader implications of the psilocybin experience and how to apply them directly to our lives.</strong> This book intends to re-sanctify this virtually demonized medicine, and inspire readers to investigate the full potential that psilocybin mushrooms may hold for the human species. He discusses his personal story, the science and history of psilocybin, a conceptual framework for navigating the implications of the psilocybin experience, how to potentiate deeply personal and applicable experiences, and how these concepts overlap into our waking lives.</p>
<p>And although these are seemingly complex topics, Jesso makes them easily understandable to a broad spectrum of readers. “I wanted this book to be interesting and applicable to the deepest psychonaught, but also something you could give to your mom,” says Jesso.</p>
<p>At a time when our society is starting to recognize the deep wounds inflicted upon ourselves by a history of violence, could psychedelic mushrooms be the key to releasing those wounds and moving towards a more beautiful future?</p>
<p>“It certainly isn’t for everybody, and it’s by no means an easy process. When we choose to enter the depth of emotional potential that psilocybin mushrooms can unlock, we enable an exploration of all the things that hold us back. In that place, we can come face to face with our greatest darkness – all that we fear about ourselves. I believe it is only by facing this darkness that can we discover our true bravery, and in turn, our ability to create beauty in this world.”</p>

<p><strong>Where is this money going?</strong></p>
<p>The writing of this book emerged after Ileft my full-time wage job and dedicated myself to the full-time position of writer. Though I have gone back to wage positions during the writing process to re-stock on the funds required for living, the process of surrendering financial security to achieve my dream has been both invigorating and terrifying. I have done the first steps on my own (with some help from my credit card) and now, as I approach an even grander manifestation of my gift to this world, I recognize that I need help to see this vision come to fruit. But who would I be to ask for your financial support without telling you where it is going?</p>
<p>At this point, at least $6,000 is needed to successfully launch the book and follow through with the tour.  Funds will go towards:</p>
<p><strong>The Book</strong><em> (Approx $2,500+):</em></p>

</ul><p><strong>The Tour</strong> (<em>At least $4,000+</em>):</p>
<p>I have already begun to connect and establish positions at 5 festivals and 5 major cities. This tour will range from the middle of June to the middle of August, 2013 and span Western Canada from northern Alberta to Vancouver Island.</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>What’s So special About This Campaign?</strong></p>
<p>As my life has progressed, I have come closer and closer to realizing what I can accomplish in this world. With each successive step I have come to see how much of an impact I can have on the people around me, and how fully I can embody my passions in this world. As I come to understand my true potential, I also have come to understand the responsibility that goes with it.</p>
<p>This book, and the tour planned around it, are expressions of me standing into a fuller embodiment of my passion: to write, to tell stories, to inspire people. It also stands as an expression of me upholding the responsibility that comes with that embodiment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, from a mass culture whose intentions (supposedly) were to protect youth from drug use, the ultimate result of our official drug policy in North America is just as many (if not more) people taking drugs, yet without an understanding of what goes along with that choice. Psilocybin Mushrooms are a very powerful substance and the greatest risk associated to them is ignorance. Their use among adults and youth alike is not going away and I wish to provide an example of why the mushrooms are not toys, but tools. I seek to provide to those who choose to explore this substance an explanation as to why they are tools and an example on how to use them safely and constructively, so as to reduce their potential harm as much as possible.</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you are not only supporting me in living my passion, but also in seeding a new culture, where powerful substances like psilocybin mushrooms no longer harm our youth from being taken in ignorance.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
My name is Andrew R. Jones and I am a Marine Corps Combat Veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  I served with Fox Co. 2/23 attached to 1st Marine Division, RCT-1 and performed combat missions in An Nasiriyah, Al Gharraf, Al Fajr and Baghdad during the initial invasion in 2003.  My post-war experience has ran me through an emotional hurricane with Post Traumatic Stress and a Traumatic Brain Injury suffered during the Battle of Baghdad on April 8, 2003.  As with many other Combat Veterans, I've turned to alcohol and drugs, attempted suicide, spent time behind bars for assault, been married and divorced twice and had my children taken from me. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>During the last two years I have finally began to get my life back on track.  I discovered how vitally therapeutic writing was for me.  I began seeing a Combat PTSD Counselor and through his guidance and my writing, I have turned my life around.  I still continue my healing process everyday and it has now become my mission to reach out to other Veterans and their supporting loved ones to motivate them to heal as well.  I now have a healthy relationship with my family, joint custody of my children and am engaged to an Angel. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>By contributing to this campaign, you will assist me in publishing and marketing an Anthology of poems and short stories focused on the issues Veterans and their loved ones endure.  By reaching out with my writing through Facebook and being published in 6 different literary journals including the International War Veterans Poetry Archives, I have already made an enormous difference in the lives of thousands of people and it is my mission to help others like me, heal their Warrior Hearts and get their stories out for everyone to read.  Along with my own writings, dozens of other Combat Veterans and loved ones have contributed their work to this Anthology and are dedicated to helping others heal. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Your contribution to this book and to this movement is vital in allowing it to gain momentum and become a reality.  <br/><br/><p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To effectively publish and market this book so it gains enough exposure to quickly take off and reach thousands to hundreds of thousands and potentially millions of people, I am looking for an amount of $2,000. </p>
<p><br/>Every penny of this money will go directly to making this book become a reality and getting it in the hands of those who would benefit.  In addition to gaining exposure for the book, funds made from sales of the book will go towards helping Veterans organizations and continuing the movement of healing Warrior Heart's.</p>
<p><br/>The perks for your contributions are explained in detail with the different levels of donations.  These perks range from my sincere gratitude, to personal ""Thank You"" messages, signed copies of the book, framed photos of my pictures on poems like the one featured above, canvas prints of the pictures on poems, a ""Thank You"" message featured in the book itself and if you donate the entire $2,000, I will consider it a loan that will be paid back in 12 months and you will be made aware of all decisions for the publishing and marketing of the book. </p>
<p><br/>If the entire amount of $2,000 is not achieved, the funds collected will still go directly towards the publishing and marketing of the book.  I am resourceful and will find ways to make this happen.  However, your help and contribution is important to achieving this mission in the quickest way possible. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every single day in America, 22 Veterans are successful in killing themselves.  Much more make the attempt and countless more seriously contemplate the idea.  Our Veterans are homeless, behind bars, hiding behind drugs and alcohol and are in need of help!  Unfortunately, the pride of a Veteran makes it difficult to reach out.  It is my mission to reach out to these Veterans, motivate them to speak up and tell their stories and to be heard!  This book is only the beginning.  From this book, will spawn a movement to help Veterans and their families.  The people are there who want to help, the families and the Veterans themselves are calling for help in their own unique ways.  the impact of this book and more projects like it in the future, will cause a cultural change in America and our allied nations. </p>

<h3>Four New Zines</h3>
<p>For over 20 years, I have been creating and publishing zines, but for the past year I have been living in a small town in rural Arkansas, where there is no decent copy shop within 80 miles. Never-the-less, on October 12, I am planning to come out of the mountains and return to Zine Fest Houston, an event I founded, where I will debut four new zines of mostly new material. The tentative titles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ouachita Journal</strong> <strong># 1</strong>: articles about Arkansas and essays about my experiences living, here, in Mena (located in the foothills of the Ouachita Mountains). This will not be a sentimental city slicker turns country boy story that romanticizes small town life. I will discuss the good, the bad, the ugly and the beautiful scenery. Illustrated with photos.</li>
<li>
<strong>Offline Adventure Zine # 1</strong>:<strong> </strong>Offline adventure is about getting out and doing stuff in the real world, regardless of how old you are or how much money you have or any other excuse that may be holding you back. In the first issue, I will talk about a couple trips I took in my twenties -- hitchhiking to Austin in 93 and traveling to New York for the twentieth anniversary of Stonewall in 94, without enough money for a return ticket. I will also include an essay that reflects on the unexpected paths my life has taken.</li>
<li>
<strong>shane # 9</strong>: shane is my ongoing minicomic, now in its tenth year, with a different theme each issue. This issue will feature articles, essays and reviews around the theme of comics, superheroes and gender studies. In one essay, I will talk about the online Gender Through Comic Books class I took this past spring, and I will also include a one-page comic I created as an assignment for that class.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cluttered Mind # 3</strong>: This zine is a hodgepodge of my various writing and art projects and usually includes a mix of reprints and new material. This issue will feature essays, short fiction, comics, poems, reviews, illustrations and photos that don't fit the themes of the other zines in this project including a new Flyin' Man story, a poem about the apocalypse and an essay about when I brought Allen Ginsberg to the University of Houston.</li>
</ul>
<p>These four zines will be more personal than most of my recent work and will represent a new direction in my artistic development. Each zine will be between 24 and 40 pages and if I make my goal, I am planning to include some full color pages.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>A Mena Zinsta</h3>
<p>Being a zinester out in the middle of nowhere provides many challenges. The most obvious problem is the lack of a zine community (or even an audience), but there are also physical obstacles, such as the fact that there is no decent copy shop within 80 miles.</p>
<p>For me this is particularly important, because not only did I used to rely on my favorite copy shop in Houston for printing, but without owning a printer or scanner, it was also a place to do the necessary prep work such as printing out text pages, reducing &amp; enlarging art, and printing up the master copy.</p>
<p>If this project is fully funded, I intend to solve these problems by purchasing the complete set up to produce my zine entirely at home. This will include a printer/ scanner/ copier combo, a booklet stapler, a cutting board, ink, paper and more. As an added bonus, the printer I have chosen does full color, and I intend to take advantage of this in my zine design. By helping me obtain this equipment, you will not only be helping fund these four zines, but you will also help make my future projects possible.</p>
<p>The budget is as follows</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$150 Printer</li>
<li>$75 Ink</li>
<li>$60 Paper - including cover stock</li>
<li>$40 Saddle Stapler</li>
<li>$35 Paper Trimmer</li>
<li>$25 Miscellaneous Expense - staples, glue, etc. </li>
<li>$80 Estimated Postage - for mailing rewards</li>
<li>$50 Indiegogo Fees</li>
<li>$35 Pay-Pal Fees</li>
<li>$200 Travel to Houston for Zine Fest</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>In the event I do not make my entire funding goal, I will use the money I do raise to either go out of town to print my zine or stay a few extra days in Houston during the week before Zine Fest to work on printing, but every effort will be made to get all four zines out in time for Zine Fest Houston, but even the worst case scenario would not result in more than a slight delay for completion of the zines and fulfillment of rewards.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I raise more money than is necessary, I will put the extra funds toward travelling to other small press shows (such as STAPLE! in Austin), bringing some of my minicomics back into print with deluxe editions or printing future zines. I will also offer additional premiums if I reach certain milestones over my goal (see Stretch Goal Rewards below).<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Premiums</h3>
<p>As an incentive for contributing at various levels, I am offering copies of the zines themselves, credits inside the zines or on the back cover, back issues of my previous zines and comics, copies of upcoming publications, art and photo prints and even my services as an unconventional tour guide. Early pickup of zines can be arranged during Zine Fest. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Stretch Goal Rewards</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to the regular premiums I have listed, helping me reach the following milestones will also result in additional rewards:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>If I make $250 over my goal, I will produce a series of postcards based on my photos and art, and everyone who contributed at the $30 level or higher will receive a set of one dozen cards to be mailed by March 2014.</li>
<li>If I make $500 above my goal, I will compile a Best of ""shane"" 10th anniversary special which will include select reprints from back issues of ""shane"" plus excerpts from my sketchbooks and other side projects from the past 10 years. If this goal is met, A special signed and numbered edition, with a variant cover, will be mailed out by May 14 to everyone who contributed at the $50 level or higher (in addition to the postcards).</li>
<li>If I double my goal and make  a total of $1500 or more, I will combine photos of Houston with my art to create a very special full-color 10th Anniversary edition of my Walkin' Man comic to be mailed out by November 2014 to everyone who contributed at the $75 level or higher (in addition to the postcards and anthology).</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, that's okay. I understand. But you can still help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let your friends know about this campaign and encourage them to contribute.</li>
<li>Use Indiegogo's sharing tools to post about this project on Twitter or Facebook.</li>
<li>Come to Zine Fest and stop by my table. Bring friends if you can.</li>
<li>Help out at my table during Zine Fest for an hour or two. In exchange, I will offer a $15 merchandise credit per hour. Email me: shane.patrick.boyle@gmail.com if you are interested in this offer.</li>
<li>Buy some of zines or art in the future when you have the resources.</li>

For over 20 years, I have been creating and publishing zines, but for the past year I have been living in a small town in rural Arkansas, where there is no decent copy shop within 80 miles. Never-the-less, on October 12, I am planning to come out of the mountains and return to Zine Fest Houston, an event I founded, where I will debut four new zines of mostly new material. The tentative titles are:


Ouachita Journal # 1: articles about Arkansas and essays about my experiences living, here, in Mena (located in the foothills of the Ouachita Mountains). This will not be a sentimental city slicker turns country boy story that romanticizes small town life. I will discuss the good, the bad, the ugly and the beautiful scenery. Illustrated with photos.

Offline Adventure Zine # 1: Offline adventure is about getting out and doing stuff in the real world, regardless of how old you are or how much money you have or any other excuse that may be holding you back. In the first issue, I will talk about a couple trips I took in my twenties -- hitchhiking to Austin in 93 and traveling to New York for the twentieth anniversary of Stonewall in 94, without enough money for a return ticket. I will also include an essay that reflects on the unexpected paths my life has taken.

shane # 9: shane is my ongoing minicomic, now in its tenth year, with a different theme each issue. This issue will feature articles, essays and reviews around the theme of comics, superheroes and gender studies. In one essay, I will talk about the online Gender Through Comic Books class I took this past spring, and I will also include a one-page comic I created as an assignment for that class.

Cluttered Mind # 3: This zine is a hodgepodge of my various writing and art projects and usually includes a mix of reprints and new material. This issue will feature essays, short fiction, comics, poems, reviews, illustrations and photos that don't fit the themes of the other zines in this project including a new Flyin' Man story, a poem about the apocalypse and an essay about when I brought Allen Ginsberg to the University of Houston.

These four zines will be more personal than most of my recent work and will represent a new direction in my artistic development. Each zine will be between 24 and 40 pages and if I make my goal, I am planning to include some full color pages.


A Mena Zinsta
Being a zinester out in the middle of nowhere provides many challenges. The most obvious problem is the lack of a zine community (or even an audience), but there are also physical obstacles, such as the fact that there is no decent copy shop within 80 miles.
For me this is particularly important, because not only did I used to rely on my favorite copy shop in Houston for printing, but without owning a printer or scanner, it was also a place to do the necessary prep work such as printing out text pages, reducing & enlarging art, and printing up the master copy.
If this project is fully funded, I intend to solve these problems by purchasing the complete set up to produce my zine entirely at home. This will include a printer/ scanner/ copier combo, a booklet stapler, a cutting board, ink, paper and more. As an added bonus, the printer I have chosen does full color, and I intend to take advantage of this in my zine design. By helping me obtain this equipment, you will not only be helping fund these four zines, but you will also help make my future projects possible.
The budget is as follows


$150 Printer
$75 Ink
$60 Paper - including cover stock
$40 Saddle Stapler
$35 Paper Trimmer
$25 Miscellaneous Expense - staples, glue, etc. 
$80 Estimated Postage - for mailing rewards
$50 Indiegogo Fees
$35 Pay-Pal Fees
$200 Travel to Houston for Zine Fest


In the event I do not make my entire funding goal, I will use the money I do raise to either go out of town to print my zine or stay a few extra days in Houston during the week before Zine Fest to work on printing, but every effort will be made to get all four zines out in time for Zine Fest Houston, but even the worst case scenario would not result in more than a slight delay for completion of the zines and fulfillment of rewards.
On the other hand, if I raise more money than is necessary, I will put the extra funds toward travelling to other small press shows (such as STAPLE! in Austin), bringing some of my minicomics back into print with deluxe editions or printing future zines. I will also offer additional premiums if I reach certain milestones over my goal (see Stretch Goal Rewards below).

The Premiums
As an incentive for contributing at various levels, I am offering copies of the zines themselves, credits inside the zines or on the back cover, back issues of my previous zines and comics, copies of upcoming publications, art and photo prints and even my services as an unconventional tour guide. Early pickup of zines can be arranged during Zine Fest. 


Stretch Goal Rewards

In addition to the regular premiums I have listed, helping me reach the following milestones will also result in additional rewards:


If I make $250 over my goal, I will produce a series of postcards based on my photos and art, and everyone who contributed at the $30 level or higher will receive a set of one dozen cards to be mailed by March 2014.
If I make $500 above my goal, I will compile a Best of ""shane"" 10th anniversary special which will include select reprints from back issues of ""shane"" plus excerpts from my sketchbooks and other side projects from the past 10 years. If this goal is met, A special signed and numbered edition, with a variant cover, will be mailed out by May 14 to everyone who contributed at the $50 level or higher (in addition to the postcards).
If I double my goal and make  a total of $1500 or more, I will combine photos of Houston with my art to create a very special full-color 10th Anniversary edition of my Walkin' Man comic to be mailed out by November 2014 to everyone who contributed at the $75 level or higher (in addition to the postcards and anthology).

<h3>What I'm Up To</h3>
<p><em>On the morning of her thirteenth birthday, Lily kissed her father and knew that he would be dead by nightfall. The image of his death dropped into her mind suddenly and without warning. As her lips touched his she saw behind the thin skin of her closed eyes his face, pale and wet, rising up from the waves surrounded by caressing fingers of sea grass, and she screamed.</em></p>
<p>So begins LILY, a modern(ish) fairy tale about a girl who discovers she has the ability to see how others will die simply by touching them. Only she doesn't want this gift, and takes extreme measure to protect herself from it. When her mother--because every fairy tale has to have a wicked (step)mother--sells Lily's services to an evangelical preacher and his wildly popular travelling tent revival, Lily is torn away from the idyllic place she's always known as home and thrust into a world of greed and manipulation that threatens to destroy her unless she can find a way back. Oh, and did I mention that the old witch Baba Yaga has sent her on a quest as well? Or that there's an annoying 7-year-old boy preacher named Little James who tries to save her soul? Well, it's that kind of story. And that's all I'm going to say about it. </p>
<p>Many of you already know me from novels including <em>The Road Home, Z, What We Remember, </em><em>Jane Bites Back, Suicide Notes,</em> and many others. I've been writing and publishing for more than 20 years. In fact, it's the only job I've ever had. So why am I launching an Indiegogo campaign for my latest project? Because the publishing world has changed in dramatic ways over the past few years. The old model isn't working terribly well for most of us, and I believe it's time to explore other avenues for getting our work into the world.</p>
<p>LILY is an experiment in more ways than one. It's unlike anything else I've written. It's an odd book--a truly magical one--and it's been waiting patiently for its time to shine. It's also the first thing I've written without worrying about how it fits into the traditional publishing market. As a result, it's very special, and that's why I'm launching it in a special way.</p>
<p>I'm not telling you much more about the book because I want it to be a surprpise. (But you can <a href=""http://mtford.blogspot.com/2012/10/so-today-is-big-day.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">read the first three chapters</a> on my blog.) I'm hoping that if you've enjoyed my other work that you'll take a chance and see what I have in store for you this time. I can't guarantee that you'll love it, but what's life without a little adventure? </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm keeping this really simple. I'm raising money for the completition and production of the book. It's almost done. I just need to buy a few months to finish it. The physical reward for your contribution toward helping me do that is the book, in ebook, paperback, or hardcover format depending on the level you choose. With the ebook you get a hand-written thank-you card as well, because so far no one has figured out a way for authors to sign ebooks. The paperbacks and hardcovers will be inscribed.</p>
<p>""But this is a lot to pay for a book!"" Yes, it probably seems like it is. But LILY isn't just any book. It's a book that will never be available in stores. I'm not doing this to get attention for the book in the hope that a big pubisher will want to snatch it up and give me more money for it. I'm doing it to show people--including myself--that there are still readers who value unique reading experiences. I'm only printing a few hundred copies, and once they're gone, they're gone. No one but Indiegogo supporters will ever have this first edition of this particular Michael Thomas Ford novel. </p>
<p>So no, you won't get buttons or pencils or posters. You'll get a book. But it's a really special book. Only a few hundred other people will have it. And you'll also be helping us change how books get into the hands of readers.</p>
<p>And by the way, if someone tells you that $35 is too much to pay for a hardcover book, ask them how much they spent for the last concert they went to. I just shelled out $75 to see Blondie. Was it worth it? Absolutely. They were amazing. But a book is more than a 2-hour experience. Also, you get to keep it to read again. And if you want to, you can lend it to a friend to experience as well. These things all have value, even if a book doesn't (usually) come with Debbie Harry blowing you a kiss from the stage. (And if you really value that live, in-person experience, I have a donation level for that.)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Let's take a moment for a lesson on how the traditional publishing industry works, because this might help explain why I'm undertakinng this experiment. As a writer, I give my book to a publisher. In exchange, they give me a little money (the advance) as a good faith gesture. But that money isn't really a payday. It's a loan. Before I get any more money from my book, I have to pay that loan back in the form of a royalty I'm credited with for each copy of my book that sells. Only after I've paid back the advance do I get any more money.</p>
<p>So let's say a publisher really loves my book and decides to give me an advance of 10K for it. (I'm using round numbers to make this easy on my math-impaired brain.) The publisher prints a paperback and assigns a price of $15. If I have a good deal with them, my royalty rate is 8% of that $15 sale price, so for every copy of LILY sold, I'm credited with $1.20. If my math is correct, this means I have to sell 8,334 copies of my book to pay back that 10K I was given as an advance. Only after that's done does the publisher owe me anything else.</p>
<p>And here's the thing--most writers never earn back that advance. 8,334 copies is a lot to sell. Most books sell far fewer copies than that. FAR fewer. So most authors are never going to see any money beyond what they were given for an advance. And advances are getting smaller and smaller as publishers get more and more reluctant to take chances on anything other than books with broad commercial appeal.</p>
<p>Part of the problem, of course, is that 92% of a book's sale price (on the paperback in my example) goes to the publisher. Now, they've taken all the risk and put up the money for editing, designing, printing, marketing, and distribution, so maybe this is fair. I'm not here to argue that. I'm just trying to explain why it is that the authors of the books you love to read so often seem to be in financial distress. </p>
<p>This is why I love things like Indiegogo. It gives writers (and all artists) a chance to take our work directly to readers. A huge percentage of what you donate will still go to covering the costs of editing, designing, and printing a book, or recording a CD. But because more of what our work earns is going to us, the artists you support will have a fighting chance of going on to make the next record, or write the next book, or create the next show. By removing the obstacles created by outdated ways of operating, we're creating new opportunities. And that's exciting.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know there are a lot of ways you could spend your money. There are always other projects, or other deserving charities. One of my personal interests is dog rescue. There are literally millions of dogs out there who need help, and I can't help them all. So I make decisions based on where I think my time or money will be used most effectively. (That's not true. My decisions about dogs are generally irrational, which is why I have a house full of them.) My point is, I make choices every day about where to help, as I know you do as well. If you aren't in a position to donate to my campaign, please consider helping by spreading the word. All I need is 280 people to donate at the Paperback level, or 200 at the Hardcover level.

</div></div>","What I'm Up To
On the morning of her thirteenth birthday, Lily kissed her father and knew that he would be dead by nightfall. The image of his death dropped into her mind suddenly and without warning. As her lips touched his she saw behind the thin skin of her closed eyes his face, pale and wet, rising up from the waves surrounded by caressing fingers of sea grass, and she screamed.
So begins LILY, a modern(ish) fairy tale about a girl who discovers she has the ability to see how others will die simply by touching them. Only she doesn't want this gift, and takes extreme measure to protect herself from it. When her mother--because every fairy tale has to have a wicked (step)mother--sells Lily's services to an evangelical preacher and his wildly popular travelling tent revival, Lily is torn away from the idyllic place she's always known as home and thrust into a world of greed and manipulation that threatens to destroy her unless she can find a way back. Oh, and did I mention that the old witch Baba Yaga has sent her on a quest as well? Or that there's an annoying 7-year-old boy preacher named Little James who tries to save her soul? Well, it's that kind of story. And that's all I'm going to say about it. 
Many of you already know me from novels including The Road Home, Z, What We Remember, Jane Bites Back, Suicide Notes, and many others. I've been writing and publishing for more than 20 years. In fact, it's the only job I've ever had. So why am I launching an Indiegogo campaign for my latest project? Because the publishing world has changed in dramatic ways over the past few years. The old model isn't working terribly well for most of us, and I believe it's time to explore other avenues for getting our work into the world.
LILY is an experiment in more ways than one. It's unlike anything else I've written. It's an odd book--a truly magical one--and it's been waiting patiently for its time to shine. It's also the first thing I've written without worrying about how it fits into the traditional publishing market. As a result, it's very special, and that's why I'm launching it in a special way.
I'm not telling you much more about the book because I want it to be a surprpise. (But you can read the first three chapters on my blog.) I'm hoping that if you've enjoyed my other work that you'll take a chance and see what I have in store for you this time. I can't guarantee that you'll love it, but what's life without a little adventure? 


What I Need & What You Get
I'm keeping this really simple. I'm raising money for the completition and production of the book. It's almost done. I just need to buy a few months to finish it. The physical reward for your contribution toward helping me do that is the book, in ebook, paperback, or hardcover format depending on the level you choose. With the ebook you get a hand-written thank-you card as well, because so far no one has figured out a way for authors to sign ebooks. The paperbacks and hardcovers will be inscribed.
""But this is a lot to pay for a book!"" Yes, it probably seems like it is. But LILY isn't just any book. It's a book that will never be available in stores. I'm not doing this to get attention for the book in the hope that a big pubisher will want to snatch it up and give me more money for it. I'm doing it to show people--including myself--that there are still readers who value unique reading experiences. I'm only printing a few hundred copies, and once they're gone, they're gone. No one but Indiegogo supporters will ever have this first edition of this particular Michael Thomas Ford novel. 
So no, you won't get buttons or pencils or posters. You'll get a book. But it's a really special book. Only a few hundred other people will have it. And you'll also be helping us change how books get into the hands of readers.
And by the way, if someone tells you that $35 is too much to pay for a hardcover book, ask them how much they spent for the last concert they went to. I just shelled out $75 to see Blondie. Was it worth it? Absolutely. They were amazing. But a book is more than a 2-hour experience. Also, you get to keep it to read again. And if you want to, you can lend it to a friend to experience as well. These things all have value, even if a book doesn't (usually) come with Debbie Harry blowing you a kiss from the stage. (And if you really value that live, in-person experience, I have a donation level for that.)


The Impact
Let's take a moment for a lesson on how the traditional publishing industry works, because this might help explain why I'm undertakinng this experiment. As a writer, I give my book to a publisher. In exchange, they give me a little money (the advance) as a good faith gesture. But that money isn't really a payday. It's a loan. Before I get any more money from my book, I have to pay that loan back in the form of a royalty I'm credited with for each copy of my book that sells. Only after I've paid back the advance do I get any more money.
So let's say a publisher really loves my book and decides to give me an advance of 10K for it. (I'm using round numbers to make this easy on my math-impaired brain.) The publisher prints a paperback and assigns a price of $15. If I have a good deal with them, my royalty rate is 8% of that $15 sale price, so for every copy of LILY sold, I'm credited with $1.20. If my math is correct, this means I have to sell 8,334 copies of my book to pay back that 10K I was given as an advance. Only after that's done does the publisher owe me anything else.
And here's the thing--most writers never earn back that advance. 8,334 copies is a lot to sell. Most books sell far fewer copies than that. FAR fewer. So most authors are never going to see any money beyond what they were given for an advance. And advances are getting smaller and smaller as publishers get more and more reluctant to take chances on anything other than books with broad commercial appeal.
Part of the problem, of course, is that 92% of a book's sale price (on the paperback in my example) goes to the publisher. Now, they've taken all the risk and put up the money for editing, designing, printing, marketing, and distribution, so maybe this is fair. I'm not here to argue that. I'm just trying to explain why it is that the authors of the books you love to read so often seem to be in financial distress. 
This is why I love things like Indiegogo. It gives writers (and all artists) a chance to take our work directly to readers. A huge percentage of what you donate will still go to covering the costs of editing, designing, and printing a book, or recording a CD. But because more of what our work earns is going to us, the artists you support will have a fighting chance of going on to make the next record, or write the next book, or create the next show. By removing the obstacles created by outdated ways of operating, we're creating new opportunities. And that's exciting.


Other Ways You Can Help
I know there are a lot of ways you could spend your money. There are always other projects, or other deserving charities. One of my personal interests is dog rescue. There are literally millions of dogs out there who need help, and I can't help them all. So I make decisions based on where I think my time or money will be used most effectively. (That's not true. My decisions about dogs are generally irrational, which is why I have a house full of them.) My point is, I make choices every day about where to help, as I know you do as well. If you aren't in a position to donate to my campaign, please consider helping by spreading the word. All I need is 280 people to donate at the Paperback level, or 200 at the Hardcover level. Maybe there are even 467 people who want LILY as an ebook. Although I kind of hope not, as my arthritis makes it really difficult for me to write by hand, and the idea of writing and addressing 467 thank-you cards is kind of sick-making. But I'd do it for you. I'm a giver.

<h2><strong>The Impact &amp; About The Book</strong></h2>
<p>No matter what kind of person we are, we all share one thing in common… desire to love and foster relationships. But if this is what truly creates happiness, why is it the most complex and the hardest thing to grasp?</p>
<p>Even when we are involved in a long term relationship or marriage, we often fall into moments of worry and doubt for our partners and ourselves. Is this normal? How can we resolve this? Why is it that when this journey of building relationships seems daunting, we are made to be communal beings?</p>
<p>We all deserve to be happy and successful in our relationships… and my team and I truly believe that The Cupcake Theory will make a contribution in reaching this goal of happiness in our world.</p>
<p>The Cupcake Theory Book is a short 64 page novelty book that can be gifted, put on coffee tables, or carried around in your pocket book. This is a simple yet profound little book of wisdom that sticks with you forever in a unique perspective about relationships. After you read this book, you will never look at cupcakes the same way!</p>
<p>The book consists of 10 illustrations and insightful text that is relatable and comparable. The book is very engaging and exciting to read quickly. Since the moment I came up with this theory, I never looked at my relationships the same way. I have also shared this concept with my friends and family and they too will state that they can’t help but to remember the CCT ever since I explained the theory to them. The Cupcake Theory is a little book for the people. It’s for all of us to savor and apply in our own lives… it’s a book that is so inevitable to remember.</p>
<p>This book will make a difference in our lives whether in our romantic or professional relationships and you can be part of it! I will make sure you are recognized and part of this movement as our contributor.</p>

<h2><strong>The Story </strong></h2>
<p>I have a dream… a passion, and that is to inspire and help other individuals in the world overcome various obstacles and reach their fullest potentials in their lives. I have realized this path for myself when I temporarily lost my eyesight at age 19; followed by a full year of post-surgery rehabilitation where I had to be forced to give up all of my passions in the arts from hip-hop dancing and choreographing to modeling, and even singing for the entire year. I was told that if I resumed doing any high intensive exercise or activity that required putting pressure in my eyes, I may have permanent sight loss. Being forced to give up on the biggest part of myself (performing and being the biggest clown/entertainment for the people) and the driver of my inspiration and energy, I could not help but cave inward and spend the next year after surgery being in the most vulnerable, confused, and emotional place of my life. For a whole year straight, I had to go in and out of emergency rooms and doctor visits once every week for check-ups, not even mentioning the medical bills I had incurred because back then I didn’t know the different between PPO and HMO insurance!</p>
<p>This circumstance gave me two choices, either go: 1. “balls out” (if I had one!) crazy, give up on my life, and be reckless or 2. take this time to look inward and identify what is really important to me, and find ways to cope with my situation, and get help from people and my loved ones.</p>
<p>Luckily, I chose the second option.</p>
<p>During this time, since I couldn’t express myself through performing arts, I began to write even more than I used to (I’ve always been a journal writer), read, think on my own, talk and listen to friends, family and mentors who reached out to help me…</p>
<p>During the countless, probably a whole water tower worth of, tears, encouraging words and hopeful laughter from my supporters, I realized how much of an impact this had on me where my darkest outlook and perspective was transformed into enlightenment and inspiration.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong - I also saw many people who I thought were my best friends, boyfriend, and supporters slowly march their way out of my life in various ways. In addition, I also saw those people, who I never expected to be there for me, voluntarily enter into my life with love and compassion. These events made me experience the ride of the most extreme ‘emotional roller coaster!’</p>
<p>Despite my circumstances, these relationships really fostered happiness, inspiration and strength inside of me to fight through my physical challenges.</p>
<p>Through this experience, I had learned the importance of relationships from friendships to romantic encounters, as well as, what it really takes to stay happy and successful in them… It had made such an impact in my life - I knew this was my calling.</p>
<p>Gratefully, I am seeing out of my two eyes now, and back pursuing my passions in entertainment, fashion and media with a slightly different motivation and direction than I had when I was 19 years old. Now my focus is applying my talents and love for business and helping others see what’s really important… their inner beauty and inner energy. For the past two years, I have started this movement through modeling, winning titles nationally, being published in magazines and newspapers, as well as, coaching aspiring models and artists to help them gain confidence and realize their beauty despite size or class; emphasizing that the strength and courage to be happy and successful all comes from within.</p>
<p>Now, I am ready to continue my journey and return my life-changing gift I received during my darkest times back to the world through my passions… starting from what drove my inspiration and courage when I couldn’t express myself through my passions: Writing &amp; Relationships.</p>
<p>So here I am, with my first book, The Cupcake Theory, a self-help, inspirational novelty book that reveals the secret ingredient to being happy and successful in your relationships!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why is it so important?</strong></h2>
<p>I am not trying to create The Cupcake Theory into just a book, but as the beginning of a movement; a movement for all of us to finally begin to see that the core ingredient to being happy and taking control of our relationships is looking within ourselves. The goal of this book is truly, to empower every single one of us in relationships through using a simple yet sweet analysis of cupcakes and our souls which will help us remember the concept. I hope to reach as many people and spread the message to the world in various languages and forms (book and other types of media) so we can all have a bit more clue to this thing we call: life.</p>
<p>Moreover, this project is so important to me… I have faithfully dedicated myself to contribute in unconditionally helping individuals, making the world a better place, and showing what really matters. On a personal note, this project is important to me because The Cupcake Theory will help me accomplish my goals of helping others and spreading inspiration to the world.</p>
<p>Before my eye experience and numerous relationships experiences, I thought I was invincible - no sense of filter, just so new to everything... Then when I woke up that one summer morning in New York City, seeing nothing but black dots out of my right eye, stumbling out of bed, digging into the bathroom mirror, rubbing my eye thinking it’s just fallen eye lashes and “sleepys” in my eye, I now know that it was an opening to my calling and mission in life. That year and a half of blindness and struggles were the preparation to the path of my life’s destiny. So please, join me in this movement and growth together… The Cupcake Theory will be put into good purpose!</p>

<p>In creating the Cupcake Theory, I have collaborated and partnered with the most creative, experienced, and talented professionals from all over the world. Book design, cover design, formatting, typesetting, illustrations, editing, photography, legal, copywriting, website design, all required extremely high personal costs. Though I decided to independently publish this book through my own publishing company, I have taken every single step that a traditional publishing company takes thanks to the help of my creative team, business mentors, lifelong friends and professional connections.</p>
<p>The Cupcake Theory Book has been accepted by an extremely reputable and global distribution company. Usually, large distributors rarely take on one titled publishers / authors unless the authors show huge potential and they truly believe in the book. Same goes for overseas reputable printing companies. The book has been also endorsed by reputable industry professionals from a Best Selling author, former Glamour Magazine writer, professor and author, dean of a very renowned university, life coaches who change and transform lives of individuals, as well as, entertainment company professionals and personalities.</p>
<p>With such great honor and support from others comes responsibility. And that responsibility is to truly work my absolute best to get The Cupcake Theory out to public where people can get it, read it and really benefit from it. This is where your help can come in. Help us print more books and create the website that can speak for its own! This includes printing overseas, working with a very reputable and global distribution company (who made an exception to taking on The Cupcake Theory due to its message), legal contracts, working with renowned editors, endorsers, designers, typesetters, reviewers, business costs, website creations.</p>
<p><strong>The book IS completed and the initial print run is in the process and the book will launch October 1, 2013;</strong> however, to push this project to true fruition and its fullest potential, we need as much help as possible from you. As mentioned before; we are creating a movement, not just a single book. The book will continue its message through various forms of writing and media. We need your help to kick start this!</p>

Savor the images.  Reflect on the words.  And as you do those things, know that the simplest pieces of advice are often the most profound.  Don’t be surprised if something you might have thought of as frivolous turns out to hold the key to discovering your inner beauty.

Hello! my name is Clara Lee and I am full of love, imperfections, laughter, goofy moments, and passion.
     
Thank you sincerely for taking the time to open this campaign! I am so delighted and grateful to have this opportunity to share this with you and possibly gain your heart filled support for this project as I’ve been working on this project for the past year and a half with passion and dedication in ultimately inspiring and helping other people with this book!
 
 
Objective of this Campaign: 

As we officially launch The Cupcake Theory book on October 1st, 2013, we are raising money for website development, additional printing, education and promotion. This campaign will truly begin the movement to influence and empower our teens and young adults and women on reaching true happiness and wholeness in our relationships, love, and dating! The Cupcake Theory book exposes the single most important ingredient in being happy in our relationships through self-love. 

                                    
                                     
Cupcakes are already the sweetest treats in the whole world! Now, there’s a THEORY behind it that will change our lives and our relationships called The Cupcake Theory! Imagine cupcakes making you happy inside and out?! That’s seriously… SWEET!
I truly and sincerely believe that if we hold hands and synergize, we can make the impossible possible and positively change the world & I also know that I am where I am because of the support I received from others!
Please help introduce The Cupcake Theory to the world, let’s make this OUR project!
 

Once we reach our goal, the rest of the funds will go to: 60% non-profit organization(s) and 40% continuing this movement (please see 'where the funds will go' section for more information)  

 
                                                 
 Cupcakes are now so trendy, but Clara Lee’s advice is tested, tried and ever true.  Teen girls, in particular, should heed her simple lessons about loving and depending on themselves as the cornerstone for a healthy romantic relationship.                  - Janet Lever, Author/Professor/Former Columnist for Glamour magazine
 
 Truly inspiring.  I really enjoy the simplicity of the layout, the wonderful illustrations and your straight forward, uplifting prose.  A delicious theory that, for the rest of your life, will cause you to pause every time you bite into a cupcake. Discover the true meaning of cake versus frosting.
- Ron Buse, Creative Services director, top Fortune 500 entertainment company
                                         
The Impact & About The Book
No matter what kind of person we are, we all share one thing in common… desire to love and foster relationships. But if this is what truly creates happiness, why is it the most complex and the hardest thing to grasp?
Even when we are involved in a long term relationship or marriage, we often fall into moments of worry and doubt for our partners and ourselves. Is this normal? How can we resolve this? Why is it that when this journey of building relationships seems daunting, we are made to be communal beings?
We all deserve to be happy and successful in our relationships… and my team and I truly believe that The Cupcake Theory will make a contribution in reaching this goal of happiness in our world.
The Cupcake Theory Book is a short 64 page novelty book that can be gifted, put on coffee tables, or carried around in your pocket book. This is a simple yet profound little book of wisdom that sticks with you forever in a unique perspective about relationships. After you read this book, you will never look at cupcakes the same way!
The book consists of 10 illustrations and insightful text that is relatable and comparable. The book is very engaging and exciting to read quickly. Since the moment I came up with this theory, I never looked at my relationships the same way. I have also shared this concept with my friends and family and they too will state that they can’t help but to remember the CCT ever since I explained the theory to them. The Cupcake Theory is a little book for the people. It’s for all of us to savor and apply in our own lives… it’s a book that is so inevitable to remember.
This book will make a difference in our lives whether in our romantic or professional relationships and you can be part of it! I will make sure you are recognized and part of this movement as our contributor.
 
The Story 
I have a dream… a passion, and that is to inspire and help other individuals in the world overcome various obstacles and reach their fullest potentials in their lives. I have realized this path for myself when I temporarily lost my eyesight at age 19; followed by a full year of post-surgery rehabilitation where I had to be forced to give up all of my passions in the arts from hip-hop dancing and choreographing to modeling, and even singing for the entire year. I was told that if I resumed doing any high intensive exercise or activity that required putting pressure in my eyes, I may have permanent sight loss. Being forced to give up on the biggest part of myself (performing and being the biggest clown/entertainment for the people) and the driver of my inspiration and energy, I could not help but cave inward and spend the next year after surgery being in the most vulnerable, confused, and emotional place of my life. For a whole year straight, I had to go in and out of emergency rooms and doctor visits once every week for check-ups, not even mentioning the medical bills I had incurred because back then I didn’t know the different between PPO and HMO insurance!
This circumstance gave me two choices, either go: 1. “balls out” (if I had one!) crazy, give up on my life, and be reckless or 2. take this time to look inward and identify what is really important to me, and find ways to cope with my situation, and get help from people and my loved ones.
Luckily, I chose the second option.
During this time, since I couldn’t express myself through performing arts, I began to write even more than I used to (I’ve always been a journal writer), read, think on my own, talk and listen to friends, family and mentors who reached out to help me…
During the countless, probably a whole water tower worth of, tears, encouraging words and hopeful laughter from my supporters, I realized how much of an impact this had on me where my darkest outlook and perspective was transformed into enlightenment and inspiration.
Don’t get me wrong - I also saw many people who I thought were my best friends, boyfriend, and supporters slowly march their way out of my life in various ways. In addition, I also saw those people, who I never expected to be there for me, voluntarily enter into my life with love and compassion. These events made me experience the ride of the most extreme ‘emotional roller coaster!’
Despite my circumstances, these relationships really fostered happiness, inspiration and strength inside of me to fight through my physical challenges.
Through this experience, I had learned the importance of relationships from friendships to romantic encounters, as well as, what it really takes to stay happy and successful in them… It had made such an impact in my life - I knew this was my calling.
Gratefully, I am seeing out of my two eyes now, and back pursuing my passions in entertainment, fashion and media with a slightly different motivation and direction than I had when I was 19 years old. Now my focus is applying my talents and love for business and helping others see what’s really important… their inner beauty and inner energy. For the past two years, I have started this movement through modeling, winning titles nationally, being published in magazines and newspapers, as well as, coaching aspiring models and artists to help them gain confidence and realize their beauty despite size or class; emphasizing that the strength and courage to be happy and successful all comes from within.
Now, I am ready to continue my journey and return my life-changing gift I received during my darkest times back to the world through my passions… starting from what drove my inspiration and courage when I couldn’t express myself through my passions: Writing & Relationships.
So here I am, with my first book, The Cupcake Theory, a self-help, inspirational novelty book that reveals the secret ingredient to being happy and successful in your relationships!
 
Why is it so important?
I am not trying to create The Cupcake Theory into just a book, but as the beginning of a movement; a movement for all of us to finally begin to see that the core ingredient to being happy and taking control of our relationships is looking within ourselves. The goal of this book is truly, to empower every single one of us in relationships through using a simple yet sweet analysis of cupcakes and our souls which will help us remember the concept. I hope to reach as many people and spread the message to the world in various languages and forms (book and other types of media) so we can all have a bit more clue to this thing we call: life.
Moreover, this project is so important to me… I have faithfully dedicated myself to contribute in unconditionally helping individuals, making the world a better place, and showing what really matters. On a personal note, this project is important to me because The Cupcake Theory will help me accomplish my goals of helping others and spreading inspiration to the world.
Before my eye experience and numerous relationships experiences, I thought I was invincible - no sense of filter, just so new to everything... Then when I woke up that one summer morning in New York City, seeing nothing but black dots out of my right eye, stumbling out of bed, digging into the bathroom mirror, rubbing my eye thinking it’s just fallen eye lashes and “sleepys” in my eye, I now know that it was an opening to my calling and mission in life. That year and a half of blindness and struggles were the preparation to the path of my life’s destiny. So please, join me in this movement and growth together… The Cupcake Theory will be put into good purpose!

Where The Funds Will Go:
In creating the Cupcake Theory, I have collaborated and partnered with the most creative, experienced, and talented professionals from all over the world. Book design, cover design, formatting, typesetting, illustrations, editing, photography, legal, copywriting, website design, all required extremely high personal costs.

Same goes for overseas reputable printing companies. The book has been also endorsed by reputable industry professionals from a Best Selling author, former Glamour Magazine writer, professor and author, dean of a very renowned university, life coaches who change and transform lives of individuals, as well as, entertainment company professionals and personalities.
With such great honor and support from others comes responsibility.

<h1><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Our Heart Desires</span></h1>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">What we all desire is love, compassion, respect and a stable and peaceful home. We truly want to be together forever with our husband or wife. But we have been shocked to see the harsh reality of the unpleasant state of  the marriage institution in our society where divorce rate is about 50%. It is obvious that things are currently not the way God the Author of the marriage institution intended it to be. God “…saw every thing that he had made,including marriage, and, behold, <em>it was</em> very good.” You can see it yourself that not all marriages in our society today can be called very good, beautiful or honorable. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">       My dear friend, you don’t have to be part of the bad statistics, and if you are already in such a situation there is help. There is a solution. In these books you will learn how to become irresistible to your very own dear husband or wife in just 7 days. Yes it is possible. It has worked for many already. Bring back love, passion, intimacy and respect like the way it used to be during courtship, honeymoon and shortly thereafter and divorce-proof your marriage. Discover the secret of a happy, holy and lasting marriage. <strong>All you need to do is to just follow the practical guidelines in these books.</strong></span></p>
<h1><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Here are some of the headlines in these books:</span></h1>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Prepare to be free and responsible; have your own private home as a family.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Both of you MUST agree on how to relate to the in-laws. You must have a common front. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* You did not meet each other by chance and your marriage is not a mistake. All things can work together for good</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Let the courtship and honeymoon be continued in principle. You can bring back those good old days.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Make love your daily goal to measure up. With true love, your marriage cannot fail. Compete in giving and to out-giving each other love and not in power struggle. Surprise each other with little gifts. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Compliment your spouse often and focus on what is good about your spouse. Use endearing names (honey, sugar, babe, sweetheart, darling or handsome etc.)  when calling your spouse. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Harsh, angry words crush your spouse's desire to please you. Therefore determine to speak softly and kindly. Do not criticize or nag. Remember that criticism and nagging destroy love. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Try to make your partner happy, rather than good. Try and give seven compliments before one suggestion or criticism.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Be each other best friends. Learn to laugh and enjoy wholesome times together by playing and doing things together in moderation and with balance. Be considerate and lookout for the well-being of the other person. Do not always insist on your own ways.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Be clean, modest, orderly, hardworking and always be ready to lend a helping hand with enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Talk things over and counsel together freely. Learn communication and conflict resolution skills so you can avoid many blunders that could destroy your marriage.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Take time to discuss and agree on how to spend the money.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Never go to bed angry with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Pray audibly together with each other and for each other. Bless your spouse and do not curse. What you prophesy to your spouse and your children usually come to pass. There is God given power in your words, use it to profit your family and not to destroy it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Agree that divorce is not the answer, because it is not a positive solution, and that God hate divorce. Forgiveness is always better than divorce.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Do not be deceived by the thought that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* Men, remember that for you to have success in whatever you do in life, you MUST love, cherish, live with your wife according to knowledge, give honor to her and win her by gentle persuasion and not by force, threat, coercion, manipulation, withdrawal, neglect or apathy.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">* You only have one life to live, so live it to the fullest with a purpose and you must both agree on that goal. Do not settle for less.</span></p>
<h1><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Excerpt from the books</span></h1>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">       ""Yet I had another opportunity to exhibit my art at an art show even much earlier than the one I told you before. Soon after I finished setting up my booth that morning, a lady who was an art lover come to my booth and started to look through my artworks that were on display. So like a tour guide I started to familiarize her with the artworks. As I was explaining to her about the “Together Forever”, I decided to read to her the poem that I wrote to accompany the “Together Forever”art piece. When I finished reading it to her she then asked me regretfully, “Where were you a month ago before I divorced my husband? I wish I knew this earlier” she said. Like this humble lady who is now an “ex-wife” of an “ex-husband”, many men and women wish they knew better before their marriages hit the rock. It is probably a common knowledge that it is not all divorce incidents that have a soft landing. Some at times do have a terrible crash against a hard rock and sometimes these marital accidents become fatal. The news media is filled with such horrible cases. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">       One man after securing all the children in the house, called up his wife on the phone and shot all their children and then himself while the wife was listening. He decided to take that route after he had repeatedly pleaded with his wife not to divorce him and the woman insisted on proceeding with her decision anyway and then finalized the divorce. Another man just walked off his marriage leaving his wife and their young and growing children behind at the time when they needed him the most. He left them to languish and struggle to survive. I really do not want to bother you any more with such unpleasant reports. You hear so much of that regularly on our news media all the time. Isn't that the sad but the true state of our nation. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">       You probably know someone who is deeply heartbroken from a divorce experience. While some are filled with guilt, regretfully blaming themselves for what they consider to be their foolish actions, many are pointing their accusing fingers at their exes or some other third parties for their fate. As I was saying, divorce usually come with a lot of emotions, which are mostly negative. Many if not all who experience it are feeling duped, cheated and violated. Some are feeling wounded, used and embarrassed. Yet some are feeling lonely, unloved, unappreciated, trampled upon and relegated to the lowest state of “self-esteem”, being robbed of their self-worth, self-confidence, positive self-image, dignity, self-respect and self-assurance. These experiences do undermine their fullness of joy and may now be filled with so much lack of forgiveness, anger and hatred toward their exes; their past love. Such ill feeling toward another person is a canker-worm. A super destroyer that begin to eat a person’s health fabric slowly but surely, gradually undermining the immune system which is our God’s given defense against all sicknesses and diseases. Many women and men have developed diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular problem and most especially breast cancer among the women because of these negative emotions that resulted from bad marriages.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">       My dear friend, you don’t have to experience such a devastation. And if you are already in such a situation there is help. There is solution. This is why God who love you so much made it possible for this book to be written. And that same God who knows what you are going through right now and desire love, joy and peace for you is the one who put this book in your hand and provided you with this opportunity to read and be blessed. Amen.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">      Yes I know you are asking, how does that poem about the painting “Together Forever” read? It is actually very simple. Here it is:""</span></p>

Our Heart Desires
What we all desire is love, compassion, respect and a stable and peaceful home. We truly want to be together forever with our husband or wife. But we have been shocked to see the harsh reality of the unpleasant state of  the marriage institution in our society where divorce rate is about 50%. It is obvious that things are currently not the way God the Author of the marriage institution intended it to be. God “…saw every thing that he had made,including marriage, and, behold, it was very good.” You can see it yourself that not all marriages in our society today can be called very good, beautiful or honorable. 
       My dear friend, you don’t have to be part of the bad statistics, and if you are already in such a situation there is help. There is a solution. In these books you will learn how to become irresistible to your very own dear husband or wife in just 7 days. Yes it is possible. It has worked for many already. Bring back love, passion, intimacy and respect like the way it used to be during courtship, honeymoon and shortly thereafter and divorce-proof your marriage. Discover the secret of a happy, holy and lasting marriage. All you need to do is to just follow the practical guidelines in these books.
Here are some of the headlines in these books:
* Prepare to be free and responsible; have your own private home as a family.
* Both of you MUST agree on how to relate to the in-laws. You must have a common front. 
* You did not meet each other by chance and your marriage is not a mistake. All things can work together for good
* Let the courtship and honeymoon be continued in principle. You can bring back those good old days.
* Make love your daily goal to measure up. With true love, your marriage cannot fail. Compete in giving and to out-giving each other love and not in power struggle. Surprise each other with little gifts. 
* Compliment your spouse often and focus on what is good about your spouse. Use endearing names (honey, sugar, babe, sweetheart, darling or handsome etc.)  when calling your spouse. 
* Harsh, angry words crush your spouse's desire to please you. Therefore determine to speak softly and kindly. Do not criticize or nag. Remember that criticism and nagging destroy love. 
* Try to make your partner happy, rather than good. Try and give seven compliments before one suggestion or criticism.
* Be each other best friends. Learn to laugh and enjoy wholesome times together by playing and doing things together in moderation and with balance. Be considerate and lookout for the well-being of the other person. Do not always insist on your own ways.
* Be clean, modest, orderly, hardworking and always be ready to lend a helping hand with enthusiasm.
* Talk things over and counsel together freely. Learn communication and conflict resolution skills so you can avoid many blunders that could destroy your marriage.
* Take time to discuss and agree on how to spend the money.
* Never go to bed angry with each other.
* Pray audibly together with each other and for each other. Bless your spouse and do not curse. What you prophesy to your spouse and your children usually come to pass. There is God given power in your words, use it to profit your family and not to destroy it.
* Agree that divorce is not the answer, because it is not a positive solution, and that God hate divorce. Forgiveness is always better than divorce.
* Do not be deceived by the thought that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.
* Men, remember that for you to have success in whatever you do in life, you MUST love, cherish, live with your wife according to knowledge, give honor to her and win her by gentle persuasion and not by force, threat, coercion, manipulation, withdrawal, neglect or apathy.
* You only have one life to live, so live it to the fullest with a purpose and you must both agree on that goal. Do not settle for less.
Excerpt from the books
       ""Yet I had another opportunity to exhibit my art at an art show even much earlier than the one I told you before. Soon after I finished setting up my booth that morning, a lady who was an art lover come to my booth and started to look through my artworks that were on display. So like a tour guide I started to familiarize her with the artworks. As I was explaining to her about the “Together Forever”, I decided to read to her the poem that I wrote to accompany the “Together Forever”art piece. When I finished reading it to her she then asked me regretfully, “Where were you a month ago before I divorced my husband? I wish I knew this earlier” she said. Like this humble lady who is now an “ex-wife” of an “ex-husband”, many men and women wish they knew better before their marriages hit the rock. It is probably a common knowledge that it is not all divorce incidents that have a soft landing. Some at times do have a terrible crash against a hard rock and sometimes these marital accidents become fatal. The news media is filled with such horrible cases. 
       One man after securing all the children in the house, called up his wife on the phone and shot all their children and then himself while the wife was listening. He decided to take that route after he had repeatedly pleaded with his wife not to divorce him and the woman insisted on proceeding with her decision anyway and then finalized the divorce. Another man just walked off his marriage leaving his wife and their young and growing children behind at the time when they needed him the most. He left them to languish and struggle to survive. I really do not want to bother you any more with such unpleasant reports. You hear so much of that regularly on our news media all the time. Isn't that the sad but the true state of our nation. 
       You probably know someone who is deeply heartbroken from a divorce experience. While some are filled with guilt, regretfully blaming themselves for what they consider to be their foolish actions, many are pointing their accusing fingers at their exes or some other third parties for their fate. As I was saying, divorce usually come with a lot of emotions, which are mostly negative. Many if not all who experience it are feeling duped, cheated and violated. Some are feeling wounded, used and embarrassed. Yet some are feeling lonely, unloved, unappreciated, trampled upon and relegated to the lowest state of “self-esteem”, being robbed of their self-worth, self-confidence, positive self-image, dignity, self-respect and self-assurance. These experiences do undermine their fullness of joy and may now be filled with so much lack of forgiveness, anger and hatred toward their exes; their past love. Such ill feeling toward another person is a canker-worm. A super destroyer that begin to eat a person’s health fabric slowly but surely, gradually undermining the immune system which is our God’s given defense against all sicknesses and diseases. Many women and men have developed diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular problem and most especially breast cancer among the women because of these negative emotions that resulted from bad marriages.
       My dear friend, you don’t have to experience such a devastation. And if you are already in such a situation there is help. There is solution. This is why God who love you so much made it possible for this book to be written. And that same God who knows what you are going through right now and desire love, joy and peace for you is the one who put this book in your hand and provided you with this opportunity to read and be blessed. Amen.
      Yes I know you are asking, how does that poem about the painting “Together Forever” read? It is actually very simple. Here it is:""

<h3>Rural Poets headed to the National Slam</h3>
<p>Hailing from the hardscrabble lands of Lanark County, Ontario, our team of five slam poets are headed down the road to Montreal this November to represent at Canada's National Slam competition, held each year as part of the Canadian Festival of the Spoken Word. As the only rural team, we bring the voice of back roads and small towns, of strong bonds and deep roots, of hard rock, shallow soils and slim margins, to a competition that is overwhelmingly urban. We stand out, to be sure. </p>
<p>The land and community that nurtures that strong voice is also our handicap. The Canadian Shield is beautiful country but, as the saying goes, ""There ain't a square meal in a square mile!"" Folks are spread pretty thin on the ground and a living can be as marginal as the farmland. This locale makes fundraising a challenge, especially when there are so many needs more basic than poetry. Supporting a team of poets in Montreal for a week is a hard 'ask' anywhere, but with fewer pockets and shallow means, sustaining a slam scene is tough.</p>
<p>But, the truth is, Lanark County needs to be in Montreal! The Canadian slam scene needs to hear rural voices! It needs to be shaken out of its complacent, uber-urban narrow-mindedness and reminded that diversity is open-ended. And that there is a rich, deep and ancient arts scene out beyond the four-lane.  If we can get on that stage, we will be heard. </p>

<p>CSFW Montreal have arranged very economical accommodation  The hotel suites have fully equipped kitchens which we will use to reduce the cost of food. We can drive to Montreal. Parking will add some additional costs. All the venues are nearby, but CFSW still recommends getting a transit pass for the week. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, our budget for the trip is $2500. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We run a monthly slam season throughout the year and do fundraisers at farmer's markets, etc. but bake-sales, and gate receipts have only taken us so far.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm Todd DeBonis, author of <strong>The Monkey King's Daughter®</strong> —novels for middle readers. </p>
<p>The Monkey King's Daughter® series offers the warm coming-of-age story of a contemporary teenage girl tightly wrapped in high adventure and fantastic mythological Chinese settings.</p>
<p>Steeped with the philosophical <strong>universal tenants of Compassion, Humility, Loyalty, Balance and Honor,</strong> The Monkey King's Daughter® delivers <strong>solid family core-values</strong> and a <strong>new female hero for a multicultural world</strong>.</p>
<p>I wrote the first book for my eldest daughter —and I’ve continued them—for not only my own children—but because I’ve learned that they can help make a difference for other children—even if in a very small way—through the various charities and foundations that use the novels to help raise money for their causes (China Care Foundation, China Adoption with Love.) This, to me has been my greatest reward. These organizations receive 50% of the cover price for every book sold on their behalf. In fact, I welcome the opportunity to associate the novels with any charity or foundation that helps better the lives of children, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Since books are now available worldwide (including China)— I feel it's time to get them translated into other languages. Because the stories are a wonderful blend of east and west cultures,<strong> Simplified Chinese</strong> (Mandarin) would be the logical first choice. I'd like to follow this with <strong>Spanish</strong>, then <strong>Portuguese</strong>, and hopefully someday <strong>French</strong>, <strong>Vietnamese</strong>,<strong> Korean </strong>and<strong> Japanese</strong>.</p>
<p>There are currently 4 books available in the series, with the 5th book on the way for 2013. I intend to write at least 10 books, and as many as 20, before Meilin's journey is complete.</p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>It will cost about $5,500 to professionally translate each individual book into Mandarin (or other languages,) and have them verified for accuracy, (it's important that the translations be accurate and true to the story.) I'd like to start with Book #1. If I'm fortunate enough to receive additional funding, then I'd apply those funds to have Book #1 translated into Spanish, in order to reach out to young readers in the Spanish-speaking world. Portuguese would follow. </p>
<p>The novels, themselves are for middle readers, ages 7-12. They're particularly <strong>empowering for young girls</strong>, and offer them a new, exciting, <strong>strong role model</strong> they can call their own, <strong>positive messages</strong> and <strong>values</strong>. Boys love the adventures too, since there are plenty of demons to fight, and a lot of Kung-fu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If I do not make the initial individual goal of $5,500, the funds will be donated to China Care Foundation.</strong></p>
<p>China Care provides state-of-the-art medical care to as many as 80 children (orphans) at any given time in their pre and post operative Special Care Nurseries and Family Housing Units. The Nurseries offer round-the-clock love and care until the children are strong enough to either return to the orphanage or further recuperate and receive ongoing medical treatment at their Family Housing Units for long-term recuperative care. The China Care Home Preschool ensures that their toddlers and preschool-age children do not miss out on the fun activities that enhance young children’s development and lift their moods. While in their care, the children are watched over by doting trained nannies who wipe away their tears, patiently coax smiles onto their faces, and embrace them with soothing hugs. At the China Care Home, these children who have lost their families and are fighting to survive, are never again alone in the world. </p>

Hello, I'm Todd DeBonis, author of The Monkey King's Daughter® —novels for middle readers. 
The Monkey King's Daughter® series offers the warm coming-of-age story of a contemporary teenage girl tightly wrapped in high adventure and fantastic mythological Chinese settings.
Steeped with the philosophical universal tenants of Compassion, Humility, Loyalty, Balance and Honor, The Monkey King's Daughter® delivers solid family core-values and a new female hero for a multicultural world.
I wrote the first book for my eldest daughter —and I’ve continued them—for not only my own children—but because I’ve learned that they can help make a difference for other children—even if in a very small way—through the various charities and foundations that use the novels to help raise money for their causes (China Care Foundation, China Adoption with Love.) This, to me has been my greatest reward. These organizations receive 50% of the cover price for every book sold on their behalf. In fact, I welcome the opportunity to associate the novels with any charity or foundation that helps better the lives of children, anywhere in the world.
Since books are now available worldwide (including China)— I feel it's time to get them translated into other languages. Because the stories are a wonderful blend of east and west cultures, Simplified Chinese (Mandarin) would be the logical first choice. I'd like to follow this with Spanish, then Portuguese, and hopefully someday French, Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese.
There are currently 4 books available in the series, with the 5th book on the way for 2013. I intend to write at least 10 books, and as many as 20, before Meilin's journey is complete.



What We Need
It will cost about $5,500 to professionally translate each individual book into Mandarin (or other languages,) and have them verified for accuracy, (it's important that the translations be accurate and true to the story.) I'd like to start with Book #1. If I'm fortunate enough to receive additional funding, then I'd apply those funds to have Book #1 translated into Spanish, in order to reach out to young readers in the Spanish-speaking world. Portuguese would follow. 
The novels, themselves are for middle readers, ages 7-12. They're particularly empowering for young girls, and offer them a new, exciting, strong role model they can call their own, positive messages and values. Boys love the adventures too, since there are plenty of demons to fight, and a lot of Kung-fu.
 
If I do not make the initial individual goal of $5,500, the funds will be donated to China Care Foundation.
China Care provides state-of-the-art medical care to as many as 80 children (orphans) at any given time in their pre and post operative Special Care Nurseries and Family Housing Units. The Nurseries offer round-the-clock love and care until the children are strong enough to either return to the orphanage or further recuperate and receive ongoing medical treatment at their Family Housing Units for long-term recuperative care. The China Care Home Preschool ensures that their toddlers and preschool-age children do not miss out on the fun activities that enhance young children’s development and lift their moods.

At the China Care Home, these children who have lost their families and are fighting to survive, are never again alone in the world. 
 

 
Reviews
Exciting… Loving… Adventurous… these are some words that help explain The Monkey King's Daughter... ...The Monkey King's Daughter is fantastic and I give this book five stars.—BookTrends.org
""The Monkey King's Daughter"" is excellent reading for young people and reinforces ideas of loyalty, honoring cultural authenticity, respectful development and use of special talents, and the virtue of planning ahead (for all events). ""The Monkey King's Daughter"" is exciting reading with a core of solid values. —Children's Bookwatch (April 2010)
5 out of 5 stars Quite the entertaining read, highly recommended. Some people wish they had extraordinary origins, others wish they were normal. ""The Monkey King's Daughter"" is the story of Meilin, who soon finds out that she is the daughter of the mythical Sun Wukong. With that knowledge, she finds herself missing the days when homework and boys were the only thing on her mind. A fun mix of classical Asian mythology and a charming young adult read, ""The Monkey King's Daughter"" is quite the entertaining read, highly recommended. —Midwest Book Review
Brilliant! Empowering—especially for young girls! With everything that children have to contend with growing up today, The Monkey King's Daughter is exactly the kind of novels they need to be reading.—Fatinha Kerr, Executive Director, MCS-Inc. 
Like the Percy Jackson series, The Monkey King's Daughter is a fast paced, adventurous read combining a kid in modern times with the mythology of his or her past. Add in a royal secret background replete with special powers that include impressive hand-to-hand combat skills and hair ornaments that morph into fighting weapons, and you have every kid’s secret Harry Potter fantasy. For girls seeking an Asian version of the Percy Jackson series, The Monkey King’s Daughter by T. A. DeBonis is a fast and fun read. —PragmaticMom.com
 

 
So....
Literacy — Empowering young readers — especially girls, to know that they can realize their full potential if they only believe in themselves — making a difference — this is what The Monkey King's Daughter® is all about.

<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Helvetica;""><b>ABOUT EAP</b></span></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica;"">I'm Tod Davies, and, er, apologies for my tiny
meltdown in the video above (explanation follows in the next section). I’m the
publisher and editorial director of Exterminating Angel Press, which started out as an art
project and blossomed into a full scale indie publisher, with ten books out
and two more on the way. It always was a different kind of publishing
project: we develop relationships with authors through our online magazine,
people who write in all genres and all subjects, but have one thing in common: they
believe that finding and telling new stories will lead us to finding new, more
creative ways of being.</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Helvetica;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Helvetica;""></span></p>

imaginations in new and unexpected ways.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span style=""color: #1A1A1A;"">We
never stop finding new ways to advocate for our books because we believe each
deserves a long life contributing to our cultural conversation. Our books don’t
have a sell by date; we want to keep them in front of the conversation. And the
more titles we publish, alas, the more our expenses increase. And the more we
need to expand. </span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: Helvetica;""><b>THE COMMUNITY</b></span></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica;"">As you can see from the meltdown I
had in the video here, like a lot of us, I hate asking for money—it was the one part I could not
get right, no matter how I tried. I finally lost it and just blurted. But what I’m realizing is we’re not asking
for money; we’re asking for support. And like any normal, healthy person, I do
love to give and get support. Because that knits us together as a community; it’s
what DOES knit us together. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica;"">As EAP has expanded past the small
art project where it began, as we expanded our reach, person by person, so did those expenses involved in getting out there and
meeting people at events and festivals, as well as printing costs for larger
runs of our books, costs to get the word out about those books, time needed to
use social media to find others of like mind, interact with them, and tell them
about our books.</span></p></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica;"">We can't do this on our own. We need help. What
we're looking for is enough funding to expand our word-spreading and community
building: organizing events, going to book fairs, reaching out and meeting
like minds in a number of different ways.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; color: #000206;"">More than anything, we hope to foster a community of
passionate people who will keep the important conversations we have in person
with readers, writers, librarians, and booksellers, going online. Part of what
we raise through this campaign will allow us to pay the brightest and most
capable intern we’ve ever had to step up our efforts at community building. The
more we are able to raise, the more we’ll be able to utilize her outstanding talents.
And supporting the talents of the generation that’s coming onto the scene with a
bang is one of our cherished goals.</span></p>

I'm Tod Davies, and, er, apologies for my tiny
meltdown in the video above (explanation follows in the next section). I’m the
publisher and editorial director of Exterminating Angel Press, which started out as an art
project and blossomed into a full scale indie publisher, with ten books out
and two more on the way. It always was a different kind of publishing
project: we develop relationships with authors through our online magazine,
people who write in all genres and all subjects, but have one thing in common: they
believe that finding and telling new stories will lead us to finding new, more
creative ways of being. 



We publish books of any subject, as long as
they spring from that one passionate belief. Whether
it’s rock musician Danbert Nobacon (Chumbawamba) collaborating with filmmaker
Alex Cox (Repo Man) on an illustrated anarchist fairy tale or actor
Miguel Sandoval directing Linda Callahan in a film trailer for poet David
Budbill’s genre-bending poem/play Park Songs, we want our books—and our
strategies for promoting them—to transcend the page and spark readers’
imaginations in new and unexpected ways.
We
never stop finding new ways to advocate for our books because we believe each
deserves a long life contributing to our cultural conversation. Our books don’t
have a sell by date; we want to keep them in front of the conversation. And the
more titles we publish, alas, the more our expenses increase. And the more we
need to expand. 

THE COMMUNITY
As you can see from the meltdown I
had in the video here, like a lot of us, I hate asking for money—it was the one part I could not
get right, no matter how I tried. I finally lost it and just blurted. But what I’m realizing is we’re not asking
for money; we’re asking for support. And like any normal, healthy person, I do
love to give and get support. Because that knits us together as a community; it’s
what DOES knit us together. 
As EAP has expanded past the small
art project where it began, as we expanded our reach, person by person, so did those expenses involved in getting out there and
meeting people at events and festivals, as well as printing costs for larger
runs of our books, costs to get the word out about those books, time needed to
use social media to find others of like mind, interact with them, and tell them
about our books.
We can't do this on our own. We need help. What
we're looking for is enough funding to expand our word-spreading and community
building: organizing events, going to book fairs, reaching out and meeting
like minds in a number of different ways.
More than anything, we hope to foster a community of
passionate people who will keep the important conversations we have in person
with readers, writers, librarians, and booksellers, going online. Part of what
we raise through this campaign will allow us to pay the brightest and most
capable intern we’ve ever had to step up our efforts at community building. The
more we are able to raise, the more we’ll be able to utilize her outstanding talents.
And supporting the talents of the generation that’s coming onto the scene with a
bang is one of our cherished goals.

PERKS
There are a lot of amazing talents from all
generations already contributing to Exterminating Angel Press. Our incentives,
just like our organization in general, show a wild assortment of cool
contributions by cool people, anarchic and fun, who want to contribute getting out new stories. From a
poem written by David Budbill, to a song sung by Danbert Nobacon, to an
illustration from one of our books drawn by filmmaker Alex Cox—and more—these
are no mere incentives, they're invitations to play with the rest of us at
Exterminating Angel Press.

One of our incentives, the copies of Wickedly
Sisters’ award winning Spoon and the Moon app, comes from an EAP contributor
who originally found one of our books in a Kentucky library and said, “We want
to play there!” So they do.


We’re also offering a whole book club package with
a Skype conversation with me. This is definitely self-serving (if
there is one thing I love, it’s talking about books with other enthusiasts!)
and I’m so particularly looking forward to that one.

SPREAD THE WORD!


If you can't contribute with cash–and we know how tough that is
these days–but you want to be a part of Exterminating Angel, we're always
looking for people to help us spread the word about our books, and add to the
conversation about new stories and new ways of being. There are other ways to
join with us to do that. You can consider contributing to our online magazine.
And you can spread the word about our campaign, and (Indiegogo reminds us to
remind you!) you can use the Indiegogo share tools to do it.
LAST, BUT NOT LEAST...
Thanks for your time in listening to us – and thanks to all who
support Exterminating Angel Press, and who will support it. It's our community
that powers us and makes all our work a worthwhile joy.

It's a non-fiction self-help book which introduces writing techniques for dreamers to help set, track, and follow through with personal goals and development.</p><p>I run a blog on tumblr called <a href=""http://writingnotebooks.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Writing in Notebooks</a> which, though it was originally created for personal inspiration, gained almost 1000 followers in its first year. It was intended as a place just for me to gather pictures of notebooks, journals, and writers from various places around the internet but I soon learned that other people felt as creatively inspired from these pictures as I did, and I started interacting with the community by sharing my own journaling techniques and ideas.</p><p>This ebook project is already underway with 23653 words written (as of January 2, 2014) and a few books being released to alpha readers as part of a giveaway on my blog. Though the book could technically be considered ""complete,"" it is still relatively short and I feel like I have much more information I could share.

If there is any remainder, the rest will go towards supporting me as I continue to develop this project. This is work that I am, so far, not getting paid to create. I do not, however, anticipate that there will be very much left over to go into my own pocket and of the items on the list, this is the lowest priority. The money will go towards all the other materials first.</p><p>5. If this project exceeds the minimum donation, I will use the additional money to hire a professional editor, support myself some more, and maybe even create additional bonuses and perks for my supporters.

<h4><span class=""notranlsate""></span></h4>
<span class=""notranlsate"">Imagine trying to climb a muddy slope your entire life and never understanding why. Imagine the incalculable frustration of being blessed with abundant talents and abilities and having extraordinary potential and yet, always meeting with failure.<br/><br/>Depression destroyed me. It ostracized me from my family. It cost me successive groups of friends. It drove me into alcoholism. I lost opportunities and careers. It ruined my credit. On at least three occasions it nearly cost me my life. <br/><br/>My life disappeared as tears in the rain.<br/><br/>Worse than my own lack of understanding was battling the ignorance of others, especially supposed professionals.<br/><br/>Throughout it all, the only thing that has sustained me is my faith. <br/><br/>This is my best shot in about twenty-five years to get on my feet. Helping me publish <i>As Tears In The Rain</i> will restore my life.  Nay better, it will give me an actual life since I've never really had one. Even better, it will give me the life I was meant to have. <br/><br/>Together, we can ensure this doesn't end up being just one more failure. Together, we can make this a success.<br/><br/></span><h3><span class=""notranlsate"">The Money</span></h3>
<h4><span class=""notranlsate""></span></h4>
<span class=""notranlsate"">I need $20,000USD for publishing and a website.<br/><br/>The publisher will take care of several critical tasks including editing, printing, marketing and distribution. It will cost $15,000USD. More specifically those tasks include:<br/></span><ul>
<li>Three rounds of professional editing</li>
<li>Design and formatting for both traditional and mobile device formats</li>
<li>Availability on Amazon.com®, Barnes &amp; Noble® &amp; 25,000 retail locations </li>
<li>FaceBook and Twitter fan websites</li>
<li>Comprehensive marketing to traditional (national and local) media outlets, online social networking sites, book review blogger sites</li>
<li>Book fulfillment</li>
<li>Returns policy</li>
<li>And more!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<span class=""notranlsate"">They have an A+ rating with the BBB. Having the publisher handle these tasks has several advantages. One, they have the experience and reach I couldn't possibly match. Two, it frees me up to concentrate on what I do best which is to write. Three, it removes the question of my health from the equation. In other words, regardless of how well I may or may not be doing at any particular time, the job still gets done. <br/><br/>As you no doubt know, it is far easier to create a reputation or image than it is to change one. That's why the website must be professional from the very beginning. The website will have three integrated sections:<br/></span><ul>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Social networking</li>
<li>Shopping cart<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<span class=""notranlsate"">Successful blogs are entertaining, informative, controversial or humorous. I have all those attributes.<br/><br/>Subjects for discussion include depression, poverty, faith and tainted blood scandals. <br/>Each area brings with it an enormous dedicated base.<br/><br/>The shopping cart will have two divisions. The main one will feature my writing as well as books from other self-published authors within the subject areas. I already have two books (potentially three) besides mine with another currently in progress. The other division will offer Specialty Items.

(Including sample chapters and a metaphorical description of depression for download.)Summary

Imagine trying to climb a muddy slope your entire life and never understanding why. Imagine the incalculable frustration of being blessed with abundant talents and abilities and having extraordinary potential and yet, always meeting with failure.Depression destroyed me. It ostracized me from my family. It cost me successive groups of friends. It drove me into alcoholism. I lost opportunities and careers. It ruined my credit. On at least three occasions it nearly cost me my life. My life disappeared as tears in the rain.Worse than my own lack of understanding was battling the ignorance of others, especially supposed professionals.Throughout it all, the only thing that has sustained me is my faith. This is my best shot in about twenty-five years to get on my feet. Helping me publish As Tears In The Rain will restore my life.  Nay better, it will give me an actual life since I've never really had one. Even better, it will give me the life I was meant to have. Together, we can ensure this doesn't end up being just one more failure. Together, we can make this a success.The Money

I need $20,000USD for publishing and a website.The publisher will take care of several critical tasks including editing, printing, marketing and distribution. It will cost $15,000USD. More specifically those tasks include:
Three rounds of professional editing
Design and formatting for both traditional and mobile device formats
Availability on Amazon.com®, Barnes & Noble® & 25,000 retail locations 
FaceBook and Twitter fan websites
Comprehensive marketing to traditional (national and local) media outlets, online social networking sites, book review blogger sites
Book fulfillment
Returns policy
And more!


They have an A+ rating with the BBB. Having the publisher handle these tasks has several advantages. One, they have the experience and reach I couldn't possibly match. Two, it frees me up to concentrate on what I do best which is to write. Three, it removes the question of my health from the equation. In other words, regardless of how well I may or may not be doing at any particular time, the job still gets done. As you no doubt know, it is far easier to create a reputation or image than it is to change one. That's why the website must be professional from the very beginning. The website will have three integrated sections:
Blog
Social networking
Shopping cart


Successful blogs are entertaining, informative, controversial or humorous. I have all those attributes.Subjects for discussion include depression, poverty, faith and tainted blood scandals. Each area brings with it an enormous dedicated base.The shopping cart will have two divisions. The main one will feature my writing as well as books from other self-published authors within the subject areas. I already have two books (potentially three) besides mine with another currently in progress. The other division will offer Specialty Items. These will include films (in both digital download and hard copy purchase) and works from established authors in the subject areas. The website will be quick, extremely secure, fully mobile device compatible, diverse yet focused, and offer the opportunity for continuing donations to support the blog. And who knows? It might even be fun!The $5,000USD for the website will go for hosting, design, marketing, and purchase of additional software. Your contributions will get As Tears In The Rain published complete with an extensive marketing plan increasing its exposure and sales. The website will be dynamic and professional.

Therefore, money raised beyond what is required will go to address those needs. They include:
Supplements and equipment for my health
Outfitting the kitchen

I've been in polyamorous relationships for nearly 10 years, and I've been using my experience, and the experiences of people I know, to share information on polyamorous living. Most people fall into polyamory by accident. It isn't something we plan, and there are a number of small things that take us by surprise: legal issues, health concerns, household challenges (like meal planning for mixed allergies, health problems and religious restrictions), and pregnancy.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Pregnancy is a big deal for anyone, but there is a whole cultural and medical template to see monogamous couples through the challenges it creates. For poly-folk, pregnancy creates many challenges that monogamous couples never need to confront, from the unexpected pregnancy when you can't be sure who the bio-father is, to deciding if everyone in your polycule will be raising the child together. There are legal hoops, medical hassles, and relationship issues challenges every polycule will need to confront when someone in the polycule becomes pregnant. If your polycule has been through a pregnancy, you know what I am talking about.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">I started writing the Polyamory on Purpose Guide to Pregnancy to provide information to poly-folk on these challenges. I want to create the guide that I wish I'd had during my pregnancies. I want to create a something that is a concise and complete guide to pregnancy in a polyamorous relationship, so that the information is out there for future poly-parents.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>At this point, I am making good progress on my manuscript and need to look ahead. There are several expenses in publishing a book, and the worst is paying an editor. Based on the length of my manuscript, I can expect editing to cost around $625. Copyeditors charge about $35 per hour, and on average complete work on 7 pages each hour. For a 125 page manuscript (yup, there's a <em>lot</em><span style=""font-style: normal;""> of info in this book!) that comes to $625, plus the fee IndieGoGo charges puts the total funding needed at $700.</span></p>
<p style=""font-style: normal;"">So that is what I'm asking for - $700 to help me turn out a comprehensive guide for any poly-folk who are dealing with or considering starting a new pregnancy.</p>
<p style=""font-style: normal;""> </p>
<h3 style=""font-style: normal;"">Rewards</h3>
<p style=""font-style: normal;"">I'm not asking you to help for nothing – I started this to benefit the polyamory community, and it would be silly not to start giving back right now.</p>
<p style=""font-style: normal;"">I've setting contribution at three different levels: $10, $25 and $100.</p>
<p style=""font-style: normal;"">All contributors who donate $10 or more will receive a free eBook copy of the Polyamory on Purpose Guide to Pregnancy. Your copy will be formatted as an epub, which can be read with any eReader.</p>
<p style=""font-style: normal;"">Contributors who donate $25 or more will receive a signed paperback copy of <em>Polyamory on Purpose Guide to Pregnancy</em>. You will also get a mention in the Acknowledgements section, with a link/url to your blog or website. (I reserve the right to refuse to include links to offensive material, including hate speech and spam sites. I do not consider sex-related material to be offensive.)</p>
<p style=""font-style: normal;"">The first 5 people to contribute $100 or more will receive the $25 perk, and a free subscription to future <em>Polyamory on Purpose Guides</em>.</p>
<h3 style=""font-style: normal;"">
<br/>What I'm Planning</h3>
<p style=""font-style: normal;"">The Polyamory on Purpose Guides will be an ongoing series. I currently have rough outlines for three titles, and plans for several more. I am hoping to publish two books a year for the next several years. Future books in the series will include topics such as: The Poly Home, Children, Safer Sex, Religions &amp; Polyamory and more.</p>
<p style=""font-style: normal;"">If the campaign is extremely successful and I end up getting funded with more than the $700 that I”m asking for, the extra money will go towards paying a professional cover designer, and towards improving the Polyamory on Purpose website – I'd like to take it off WordPress, get it self-hosting, hopefully add a forum section, eventually for people to discuss day-to-day issues and how they deal with medical issues, legal hassles, and the rest of the kind of stuff that I've been talk about..</p>
<h3>Why This Matters</h3>
<p>I think the <em>Polyamory on Purpose Guides</em> will provide an important resource to the polyamory community. There are some great books and resources out there about polyamory relationships, but nothing I have found on just... living life. And as an poly knows, most of what we do in a polyamorous relationship is just that – life. It's juggling schedules, having children, building careers, coping with sickness and loss... And it's time we start talking about that.</p>
<p>I hope you will help me make this resource a reality.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We all know times are tough right now. If you want to help support the Polyamory on Purpose Guide to Pregnancy, but don't have any extra money to donate, there are other ways you can help. The biggest is to spread the word about this campaign.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kayci Sartori, I'm a 3rd year college student, and my dream is to write Science Fiction stories and screenplays when I graduate. I have a passion for science and for space, as well as a passion for sketching and illustrating mermaids. I wondered how I could combine these passions, and started formulating a story about space mermaids! </p>
<p>The story itself is very loosely based off of ""The Little Mermaid,"" the connection being that the main character is a young princess who falls in love with a world apart from her own, and one of the people who live in it. In this case, the princess of the space ""mermaids"" (a alien race that were born from the stardust of a supernova long ago and are able to travel through space) wanders away from her people while they are searching for a new world to live on and encounters a young astronaut who tells her all about his planet. The story is all about finding a home and overcoming differences, with some science and fantasy sprinkled on top!</p>
<p>The book is already written, and I plan on hand drawing and coloring the illustrations in watercolor all myself. However I'm putting off drawing the official illustrations for the book until after this campaign (read on and you'll see why!)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Since I'm writing, illustrating, and publishing this book all by myself- I need some funding. I want to earn enough money to get a bunch of copies of the book printed so that I can sell them myself at comic conventions and art shows that I tour (the next of which being the beginning of April) and also to pay to work on some goodies to go along with the book (most of which will be offered as perks for donating here).</p>
<p>I've set my funding goal at the minimum amount the site will let me, which will be plenty to self publish this book. Every bit of money you donate will go towards helping the Space Mermaid campaign in some way, whether it be in actually printing the book or things to go along with it.</p>
<p><strong>Any money that I raise that I find I do not need for the initial printing process, I will donate half to the Sandy Hook School Support Fund, and half to Reading Is Fundamental, a non-profit Children's Literacy campaign.</strong></p>
<p>I've come up with a bunch of sweet little goodies to give everyone who donates, so anyone who donates even a little bit of money will get something! Anyone who donates even a dollar will get thanked in the book, and you can also recieve anything from keychains of the characters to art prints to a copy of the book to even being drawn in the book yourself as a space mermaid or merman!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a college student taking Astronomy courses, I realized there was a lot about the universe that we aren't taught as young children, most of us can recite the names of the planets in our solar system and know that stars are suns, but there is so much more to even this solar system than that. I wanted to create a book that was not just enjoyable for kids (and adults alike) with it's cute characters and story, but also taught them a little more about the solar system and universe. I talk a little bit in detail about each planet in our system, as well about supernovas and stars. </p>
<p>The story also is primarily about friendship, the space mermaids are hesitant to trust others because they have been let down and hurt in the past, but the story shows that there are truely good people out there who want to help and protect you, a moral I think we all need in times like these. </p>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Kayci Sartori, I'm a 3rd year college student, and my dream is to write Science Fiction stories and screenplays when I graduate. I have a passion for science and for space, as well as a passion for sketching and illustrating mermaids. I wondered how I could combine these passions, and started formulating a story about space mermaids! 
The story itself is very loosely based off of ""The Little Mermaid,"" the connection being that the main character is a young princess who falls in love with a world apart from her own, and one of the people who live in it. In this case, the princess of the space ""mermaids"" (a alien race that were born from the stardust of a supernova long ago and are able to travel through space) wanders away from her people while they are searching for a new world to live on and encounters a young astronaut who tells her all about his planet. The story is all about finding a home and overcoming differences, with some science and fantasy sprinkled on top!
The book is already written, and I plan on hand drawing and coloring the illustrations in watercolor all myself. However I'm putting off drawing the official illustrations for the book until after this campaign (read on and you'll see why!)


What We Need & What You Get
Since I'm writing, illustrating, and publishing this book all by myself- I need some funding. I want to earn enough money to get a bunch of copies of the book printed so that I can sell them myself at comic conventions and art shows that I tour (the next of which being the beginning of April) and also to pay to work on some goodies to go along with the book (most of which will be offered as perks for donating here).
I've set my funding goal at the minimum amount the site will let me, which will be plenty to self publish this book. Every bit of money you donate will go towards helping the Space Mermaid campaign in some way, whether it be in actually printing the book or things to go along with it.
Any money that I raise that I find I do not need for the initial printing process, I will donate half to the Sandy Hook School Support Fund, and half to Reading Is Fundamental, a non-profit Children's Literacy campaign.
I've come up with a bunch of sweet little goodies to give everyone who donates, so anyone who donates even a little bit of money will get something! Anyone who donates even a dollar will get thanked in the book, and you can also recieve anything from keychains of the characters to art prints to a copy of the book to even being drawn in the book yourself as a space mermaid or merman!


The Impact
As a college student taking Astronomy courses, I realized there was a lot about the universe that we aren't taught as young children, most of us can recite the names of the planets in our solar system and know that stars are suns, but there is so much more to even this solar system than that. I wanted to create a book that was not just enjoyable for kids (and adults alike) with it's cute characters and story, but also taught them a little more about the solar system and universe. I talk a little bit in detail about each planet in our system, as well about supernovas and stars. 
The story also is primarily about friendship, the space mermaids are hesitant to trust others because they have been let down and hurt in the past, but the story shows that there are truely good people out there who want to help and protect you, a moral I think we all need in times like these.

beginning of the independent life she’d thought she’d lost sight of one would</span></p><p>believe that all would naturally begin to fall into place and life would be good, finally.

How is it possible to experience blessings and still feel like you are drowning? </p><p></p><p><span>
</span><span><br/></span></p><p><span><strong>Introducing JNicole </strong></span></p><span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/571019/files/20140510181645-IMAG1976.jpg?1399771005"" src="""" style=""width: 228.66px; height: 316px;""/></p>
<p>It is with great joy that I get to introduce myself as not just a writer but as an author; while there are  other skills and jobs on my resume that I could list at this present time that is that one aspect of me that matters. Alright there is one other important aspect of my character that should be known which is I am a dreamer and after years of supporting and promoting the dreams of other the time came for me to finally focus on one of my own... Becoming a published author!</p></span><p>I fell in love with the written word at such a young age that I cannot recall a time when I did not want to write. This desire was well nurtured throughout my education from pre-school straight through to my days as an English major at The University of Connecticut. Countless hours growing up were spent in my room filling notebooks with poems, songs, short stories and the beginnings of quite a few books. With the completion of my first novel all of my notebooks now have a new life. It is my desire to allow this novel to lead way to a career doing what I love.</p><span><p><strong>Write what you know</strong>. Those words attributed to  one of my favorite authors, Mark Twain, have been countlessly given as advice to aspiring writers to keep their work genuine and organic. No one had to offer that advice to me because never before have I had the pleasure of creating something so real, so inspired by life itself that I felt my characters with me as their lives were penned and it is my desire that they become real to those that read the page of <strong>Time of Blessing</strong>. This is not a novel with deep complex themes or a plot that must be studied and dissected in order to grasp an understanding of it. This is a novel of real life. In this first book of a two part (at least) series we meet a thirty something woman that has taken charge of her life and stepped out on faith believing that God has brought her to a great new season in life. Faith is shaken when all that she’d hoped to have moved on from shows that it is still very much with her and prevalent in her current situation.  So the question is how do you welcome the new when the old still occupying space? How do you find strength to believe in the better when life keeps attacking?</p>
<p>Writing <strong>Time of Blessing </strong> was not a choice for me, it was not on my writing to do list but one night this determined young woman, Raphaela Edwards, found me and her story interrupted my plans. What I was writing at the time and desired to have as my first novel was put on hold while this story spoke to me. This inspirational fiction novel is a story of life transitions, of dealing with what is broken, of shifting relationships, of open doors and learning what it really means to be in a new season in life.  I am so grateful to have been given the assignment of bringing this woman to life and I hope that through this one woman’s test of faith and strength someone will be encouraged much as I was in writing her story.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Going from Manuscript to Life</h3>
<p><strong>What is needed for the process</strong></p>
<p>After seeking advice and doing an exhausted amount of research I made the decision to go the route of self-publishing for my novel.  Further research has lead me to the final decision to not go through a self-publishing company or vanity press rather do this on my own to protect myself, my work, my vision and the quality of my final product. It is a major undertaking, daunting at times but very appealing to my business side. I’ve educated myself on the process and have already begun to move forward this however there is one issue… Doing this on my own also means financing this on my own. Now I have some great people, professionals, in place to work with me through this process and I am beyond grateful for how they have been willing to work with my financial situation. At this time with the way things look the project will be slowed down and push the release of the book into mid-2015 and without some sort of financial backing it might be pushed back even further. I am not one that likes to ask for help when it comes to money but I am determined to do what needs to be done to get <strong>Time of Blessing </strong>on its feet for this is only the beginning.</p>
<p>What is needed? I am looking at a need of $15,000 to get through the entire process which includes</p>
<p><strong>Editing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Design( cover and interior)</strong></p>
<p><strong>ISBN purchase</strong></p>
<p><strong>Barcode</strong></p>
<p><strong>Copyrighting</strong></p>
<p><strong>Printing </strong></p>
<p><strong>EBook formatting &amp; release</strong></p>
<p><strong>Distribution </strong></p>
<p><strong>Marketing- website, reviews, advertising, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Also because I am not going through a self-publishing company I will be publishing under my own company name so on top of the publishing cost I face startup costs as well.</p>
<p>Now $15,000 may seem like a gross amount to spend on just a book and may seem unnecessary to many but it is to publish a book the right way. This may be a dream but it is still a business and in order to be truly market ready there are no short cuts to be taken here all must be done with excellence.  With everything that is contributed through this campaign know that everything I am is invested in this project, in this dream. I do not ask of others what I am not willing to do. </p>
<p>I am truly grateful for you willingness to support this dreamers dream and for each act of generosity please except the gifts that I have to offer to you. When you take the time to bless me I must bless you in return. </p>
<p></p>

<strong><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a very important project to me and it is my hope that it is the first of many. The success of this campaign means that I will be able to produce a quality professional product that is capable of entering an industry where new independent authors have to do all they can to get noticed. I will be able to lay the foundation for what is next to come for my career and total vision. I have already begun  <strong>Time of Blessing</strong> book two and there are other books planned to follow as well and success in this campaign means I will have things already in place for the process to begin for those projects.</p>
<p>Now the bigger picture is this, I don’t write for myself if that was the case I would be content in just filling up shelves with notebooks of my scribbles. I write to breathe something into someone else, to speak into someone else, to give to someone else. </p>
<p>I am a writer of inspirational fiction for that purpose. I have not set out to write some sensational novel, yes I want to be successful but I’m here with a purpose to effect the lives of others with the gifts that I have been given. </p>
<p>Once I am able to complete this first project my intent beyond establishing my own writing career is to be able to be a help to others like me that desire to share their gifts with others. This is about more than me.</p>
<p>I ask one more thing</p>
<p>Every way that you can contribute is greatly appreciated and besides monetary contribution please spread the word.

A new home and an opened door to a promising
new career; life was finally beginning for Raphaela Edwards. This was a time in
her life that she had prayed for, waited for and desperately needed.  After taking major steps to initiate the
beginning of the independent life she’d thought she’d lost sight of one wouldbelieve that all would naturally begin to fall into place and life would be good, finally. Good does come with an unexpected opportunity and unexpected new partner and friend and a mystery man but along with the good arises the all the unresolved issues and unhealed wounds that were thought to be left behind.  Trying to continue on with forging this new life and wanting to hold on to the joy of all that has come her way proves nearly impossible when rejection and abandonment from the past come to her front door.  This was not how Raphaela envisioned a time of blessing to be. How is it possible to experience blessings and still feel like you are drowning? 
Introducing JNicole 
It is with great joy that I get to introduce myself as not just a writer but as an author; while there are  other skills and jobs on my resume that I could list at this present time that is that one aspect of me that matters. Alright there is one other important aspect of my character that should be known which is I am a dreamer and after years of supporting and promoting the dreams of other the time came for me to finally focus on one of my own... Becoming a published author!I fell in love with the written word at such a young age that I cannot recall a time when I did not want to write. This desire was well nurtured throughout my education from pre-school straight through to my days as an English major at The University of Connecticut. Countless hours growing up were spent in my room filling notebooks with poems, songs, short stories and the beginnings of quite a few books. With the completion of my first novel all of my notebooks now have a new life. It is my desire to allow this novel to lead way to a career doing what I love.Write what you know. Those words attributed to  one of my favorite authors, Mark Twain, have been countlessly given as advice to aspiring writers to keep their work genuine and organic. No one had to offer that advice to me because never before have I had the pleasure of creating something so real, so inspired by life itself that I felt my characters with me as their lives were penned and it is my desire that they become real to those that read the page of Time of Blessing. This is not a novel with deep complex themes or a plot that must be studied and dissected in order to grasp an understanding of it. This is a novel of real life. In this first book of a two part (at least) series we meet a thirty something woman that has taken charge of her life and stepped out on faith believing that God has brought her to a great new season in life. Faith is shaken when all that she’d hoped to have moved on from shows that it is still very much with her and prevalent in her current situation.  So the question is how do you welcome the new when the old still occupying space? How do you find strength to believe in the better when life keeps attacking?
Writing Time of Blessing  was not a choice for me, it was not on my writing to do list but one night this determined young woman, Raphaela Edwards, found me and her story interrupted my plans. What I was writing at the time and desired to have as my first novel was put on hold while this story spoke to me. This inspirational fiction novel is a story of life transitions, of dealing with what is broken, of shifting relationships, of open doors and learning what it really means to be in a new season in life.  I am so grateful to have been given the assignment of bringing this woman to life and I hope that through this one woman’s test of faith and strength someone will be encouraged much as I was in writing her story.

Going from Manuscript to Life
What is needed for the process
After seeking advice and doing an exhausted amount of research I made the decision to go the route of self-publishing for my novel.  Further research has lead me to the final decision to not go through a self-publishing company or vanity press rather do this on my own to protect myself, my work, my vision and the quality of my final product. It is a major undertaking, daunting at times but very appealing to my business side. I’ve educated myself on the process and have already begun to move forward this however there is one issue… Doing this on my own also means financing this on my own. Now I have some great people, professionals, in place to work with me through this process and I am beyond grateful for how they have been willing to work with my financial situation. At this time with the way things look the project will be slowed down and push the release of the book into mid-2015 and without some sort of financial backing it might be pushed back even further. I am not one that likes to ask for help when it comes to money but I am determined to do what needs to be done to get Time of Blessing on its feet for this is only the beginning.
What is needed? I am looking at a need of $15,000 to get through the entire process which includes
Editing
Design( cover and interior)
ISBN purchase
Barcode
Copyrighting
Printing 
EBook formatting & release
Distribution 
Marketing- website, reviews, advertising, etc.
Also because I am not going through a self-publishing company I will be publishing under my own company name so on top of the publishing cost I face startup costs as well.
Now $15,000 may seem like a gross amount to spend on just a book and may seem unnecessary to many but it is to publish a book the right way. This may be a dream but it is still a business and in order to be truly market ready there are no short cuts to be taken here all must be done with excellence.  With everything that is contributed through this campaign know that everything I am is invested in this project, in this dream. I do not ask of others what I am not willing to do. 
I am truly grateful for you willingness to support this dreamers dream and for each act of generosity please except the gifts that I have to offer to you. When you take the time to bless me I must bless you in return. 

 




This is a very important project to me and it is my hope that it is the first of many. The success of this campaign means that I will be able to produce a quality professional product that is capable of entering an industry where new independent authors have to do all they can to get noticed. I will be able to lay the foundation for what is next to come for my career and total vision. I have already begun  Time of Blessing book two and there are other books planned to follow as well and success in this campaign means I will have things already in place for the process to begin for those projects.
Now the bigger picture is this, I don’t write for myself if that was the case I would be content in just filling up shelves with notebooks of my scribbles. I write to breathe something into someone else, to speak into someone else, to give to someone else. 
I am a writer of inspirational fiction for that purpose. I have not set out to write some sensational novel, yes I want to be successful but I’m here with a purpose to effect the lives of others with the gifts that I have been given. 
Once I am able to complete this first project my intent beyond establishing my own writing career is to be able to be a help to others like me that desire to share their gifts with others. This is about more than me.
I ask one more thing
Every way that you can contribute is greatly appreciated and besides monetary contribution please spread the word. Tell family, friends, friends of friends, anyone that you know that is a believer in dreams, lover of the written word, supporter of the arts and its power to inspire and effect lives. I need the support of many to help give Time of Blessing a life.

<p><i><b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AFistfulOfNothing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Fistful of Nothing</a></b></i> is a hardboiled detective novel by <b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dan-Glaser/182662745080956"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dan-Glaser/182662745080956"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dan Glaser</a></b>.  This dieselpunk noir centers around an ex-private eye who scours the collapsed metro tunnels of a revisionist 1950's-era Hollywood for payoff on a gamble gone wrong, but stumbles instead on an underground city divided by vice, vendettas, mysteries and murder plots.</p>
<h3>The Novelist</h3>
<p>Glaser has spent the last five years as an independent filmmaker. He has written, produced and directed a number of projects, including his first feature film <b><i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YP0hAtCOpM"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YP0hAtCOpM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pinching Penny</a></i></b>, shot in his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota and which went on to receive international distribution. He frequently collaborates with fellow Midwestern-bred artists Timothy J. Meyer and Steven Molony through their joint production company <b><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/unmarkedvanfilms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/UnmarkedVanFilms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unmarked Van Films</a></b>.</p>
<p>His love of film aside, Glaser has always been a storyteller: whether smashing together superhero action figures and plastic dinosaurs in the backyard as a youth (catching the chaos with his parents' beat-up yet trusty 80's camcorder), or scribbling his first novella in his seventh-grade English journal...all the way to <i>Pinching Penny</i>, Unmarked Van Films and beyond, Glaser has loved to craft stories both visually and scrawl them on the page.</p>
<p>It has always been a lifelong dream of Glaser's to write and publish a full-fledged novel, and he has taken his love of detective stories, dystopian fiction, speculative sci-fi, and 1940/50's-era Hollywood and blended them into a volume that is part unique invention, part loving homage--and he's reaching out now to his endlessly supportive family, friends, fellow artists and fans, for their help in aiding this story to see the light of day.</p>

<li>Not to mention accounting for the cut Indiegogo takes from the money raised (up to 9%).<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<ul><li>An issue that plagues many crowdfunding campaigns is the delivery on promised prizes. Each perk presented in this fundraiser has been specifically designed to be delivered digitally. The problem with physical prizes is that the creation and shipping costs end up draining a huge portion of the donations pledged, thus greatly defeating the purpose of the fundraiser in the first place. Each reward included to your right is a nifty gift, meant as a more personalized thank you from the artist for helping him get the novel off the ground and onto the shelves! Faster, guaranteed to be delivered, and without the monetary restraint on the artist you're trying to support! Think of it as a grab-bag of goodies, a little extra thanks for spending the time and energy to help!</li></ul>

<h3>The Nightcap</h3>
<p>For those readers who'd like to contribute, but money is tight, that doesn’t mean you can’t help! Here are a few less pricey ways to lend your support:</p>

<li>Get the word out! Tell a relative or steer a friend to the fundraiser to help make some noise about this campaign!</li>
<li>The Indiegogo share tools are an easy way to spread the love!</li>
<li>Remember that even contributions of $1 to $5 really go a long way! </li>

</div><div><h3><br/></h3></div></div>","Dear family and friends,


          Hey how are you? I have decided to send a month news letter over the next year just to keep you informed as to whats going on in my life. I am doing amazing, over this past year god has delivered me from depression, drugs, emotional abuse, alcohol, suicidal thoughts and reconciled with all I have hurt and all those who hurt me including my family. And I am proud to say that I am now 1 year and 1 month clean from it all. God has blessed with an opportunity now to go into master’s commission.

         

         God has opened the door to an amazing opportunity to Metro Atlanta masters commission (mamc) which is based out of Victory World Church, in Norcross, GA It is a nine month discipleship training program, beginning September 19, 2011. They works along side with other local churches all over the world. Through hands-on experience, as well as theological training, I will be trained and equipped in most every facet of ministry while being challenged to grow in my walk with Christ. This is the cry of my heart. I really believe god has opened this opportunity for me because he has an awesome plan for me over another intense year. This year through masters I am going into the missions study so I can better help troubled teens with their struggles as I went through to give them hope and a new way to live through Christ.

          

          As you may have guessed, this is a major step for me and I would greatly benefit from your prayers at this time in my life also, I am diligently working to raise money for tuition: if you feel impressed to help me financially, I would very much appreciate any support you are able to offer. There are a few ways that you can contribute you can give a one time gift, monthly, weekly, or send a check directly to the church. I have also decided to get a financial accountability to hold me accountable to stick to the budget I have drawn up. His information will be induced for any one who is curios on how I am doing in the next letter.

          

          You can make your check payable to the metro Atlanta masters commission and mail it to the church (MAMC, 5989 financial drive, Norcross, GA 30071) any financial gift to MAMC Tuition will be tax deductible. My budget includes for gas, food, cell phone bill, Landry, personal hygiene and insurance, with all that being said if you chose to write a check directly to me, (Walter Roland Arnold III)They can also be written to the church however, this will not fall under the tax guidelines of being tax deduction. Regardless of how you are able to participate, I want you to know that I am praying that god will continue to bless you and reveal to you in a more intimate way.

        


           I also wanted to say to really pray to god on how he wants you to take this letter, in 2 Corinthians 9:7-8 You must each decide in your heart how much to give And don’t give reluctantly or in response to pressure. “For God loves a person who gives cheerfully And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others”. So I ask that if god wants you to pray or give to do so with a joyful heart because it is all going toward his kingdom. I really appreciate you taking the time to read this letter. I know god is going to use this training to propel me in to his perfect plan over my life. May you have a blessed day in Jesus’ name!

<div>Rafal Kudlinski is a Polish physicist and journalist.  His career choices were very diverse. During high school years he was fascinated by science fiction television shows like “Quantum Leap”, Buck Rogers in the 25<sup>th</sup> Century and Time Trax. That led him to the first stage of his education as a Physicist. In 2003 he graduated from Wroclaw University of Technology with degree in Computer Physics. During the studies period he became obsessed with Hollywood stars. When internet approached “Big Bang” years, he started to create websites for all the stars he loved and admired, starting with Scott Bakula and ending with Hugh Jackman. He was avid viewer of E! Entertainment network and always dreamed to work for his crazy institution.  Unfortunately life took a different scenario and led him once again in different direction to pursue a stable career. In 2004 he graduated from Wroclaw University of Economics with post grad diploma in Quality Assurance. Life was good he had a steady job but the dream of becoming a journalist and desire to become part of media world started to bite again. In 2008 he started his 3<sup>rd</sup> degree at University of Wroclaw in Journalism and Social Communication from which he graduated in 2010. The same year he started an online magazine(<a href=""http://www.newsfix.pl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NEWSFix Magazine</a>) with his best friend Piotr.

<p>You guys know how moms cook. They’ll say things like a handful of rice, a pinch of cumin or even measure things with a mug/arabic coffee cup. That’s totally ok when you’re right next to mama, and you can ask her “yaani this much??”                                                                                                           </p>

I can’t tell you how many voice notes I’ve received from my mom, my aunt, my mom’s friend to explain how to make something, or how many times I’ve held my phone over a pot or a bowl to make sure I was doing things right.                                            <br/><br/>I was so intimidated. And when I spoke about it with people around me, I wasn’t the only one.<br/><br/>Living in Montreal meant that I’ll be raising my kids here, and it scared me that I couldn’t reproduce the meals I grew up eating and loving so much. Food that tasted like home.</p>
<p>So I decided to bridge that gap.<br/><br/>This is how Mama Ghannouj was born. This cookbook brings together our most loved Lebanese recipes from 10 mamas that are known to be excellent cooks in the community.

But I prefer to use words to paint pictures.</p><p>Stories By The River began as unrelated poetry and prose I’d been writing whenever I could, mostly inspired by the area around the Singapore River and life in Singapore. Some were first written as early as 2007 and some as recently as three months ago.</p><p>You'll be taken on a narrative journey across styles, settings and states of mind, complemented by wonderful watercolour art by my cousin Odilia, and I hope you'll find that this collection as a whole is also its own kind of poem.</p><p> </p><h3>Why should you buy this?</h3><p>Well, why would you buy any book, film or painting? I can’t promise you a groundbreaking piece of literature. But I can assure you that I've done everything I can to make this something I'm distinctly proud of - and I write for a living.</p><p>Also, and this is the part that has genuinely surprised me: When I first showed a whole bunch of early readers my works in progress, everyone liked a different poem best. Everyone identified with something different. It’s been a joy seeing my work through other peoples’ eyes and listening to their own interpretations of it. That’s the complete beauty of written word and I hope you’ll enjoy it the same way.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>What you're paying for</strong></h3><p>Not many tiers to this. For USD$4 you’ll get a high-quality PDF for digital reading, and for USD$12 you’ll get the printed edition (with free postage). For you generous folk, at USD$72 you'll get three copies, limited edition prints of Odilia's art (size and quantity not yet determined), and a mention of your name in the book's ""thank you"" notes. This page functions as a pre-order system so that I don’t over-print (and over-spend).<br/><br/>If I have enough proceeds from sales, I'll also organise a launch party for which you are more than welcome to attend.

But I prefer to use words to paint pictures.Stories By The River began as unrelated poetry and prose I’d been writing whenever I could, mostly inspired by the area around the Singapore River and life in Singapore. Some were first written as early as 2007 and some as recently as three months ago.You'll be taken on a narrative journey across styles, settings and states of mind, complemented by wonderful watercolour art by my cousin Odilia, and I hope you'll find that this collection as a whole is also its own kind of poem. Why should you buy this?Well, why would you buy any book, film or painting? I can’t promise you a groundbreaking piece of literature. But I can assure you that I've done everything I can to make this something I'm distinctly proud of - and I write for a living.Also, and this is the part that has genuinely surprised me: When I first showed a whole bunch of early readers my works in progress, everyone liked a different poem best. Everyone identified with something different. It’s been a joy seeing my work through other peoples’ eyes and listening to their own interpretations of it. That’s the complete beauty of written word and I hope you’ll enjoy it the same way. What you're paying forNot many tiers to this. For USD$4 you’ll get a high-quality PDF for digital reading, and for USD$12 you’ll get the printed edition (with free postage). For you generous folk, at USD$72 you'll get three copies, limited edition prints of Odilia's art (size and quantity not yet determined), and a mention of your name in the book's ""thank you"" notes. This page functions as a pre-order system so that I don’t over-print (and over-spend).If I have enough proceeds from sales, I'll also organise a launch party for which you are more than welcome to attend. I'll shout this out on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/storiesbytheriversg/ Any risks?The only moving parts left are the printing and the postal service.

<p><i>56 Days of August </i>is a collection of postcard-sized poems with more than 30 beautiful color artworks, edited by Paul E. Nelson, JI Kleinberg, and Ina Roy-Faderman, and published by Five Oaks Press. Paul, co-founder the August Poetry Postcard Festival, developed the project to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the festival and honor the spontaneous, authentic poetry that it gives birth to. We picked each poem and piece of art to explode with vivid flavor -   bursting like fresh, perfectly ripe berries in the mouth and mind.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We would like to raise $2,500 to thank the poets and artists whose work is included in the anthology and to support the launch of this book internationally. The funds will be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide a contributor’s copy to each poet and artist whose work is included in the anthology ($1,200)</li>
<li>support the anthology’s primary launch event, a poetry reading at the Cascadia Poetry Festival in Tacoma WA as well as  develop and support subsequent anthology events, currently scheduled for Bellingham, Washington, and Palo Alto, California, in addition to hoped-for events on the Portland, Oregon,  the US east coast, Canada, and India. (launch events are expected to run $100-$ 200 event for space rental, food and drinks, and sound equipment)</li>
<li>token support for the editorial staff and coverage for the cost of managing the project through the SPLAB non-profit org (IRS# 91-1618296)</li>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>William Carlos Williams once said,</p>
<p>“It is difficult / to get the news from poems /yet men die miserably every day /for lack of what is found there.” (Asphodel, That Greeny Flower)</p>
<p>The combination of universality and specificity of beauty captured in poetry is unique to the poetic form. Poems can encompass a shared experience, an opening of an unexpected doorway into other worlds, a comfort in times of trouble. The poems that are written during the August Postcard Poetry Festival tell the kind of truth that can be communicated directly from one person to another. Help us   share that beauty and those truths of living with people beyond the festival itself.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>""I have a faint memory of swallows from my childhood in Iran. I remember laying under the sun at my paternal grandparent’s terrace and imagining shapes out of the clouds when I saw a quick black bird with a strange tail decent in the sky. I asked my mother if the blackbird was also a pigeon because many of them coo coo-ed in my grandmothers’ trees.""</i></p>
<p><strong><i>Immigrant</i> </strong>is <strong>a book about change and adaptation</strong> which explores the personal and professional identities of a 30-year-old immigrant woman.<br/><br/>My name is Golara Haghtalab and I am the author of Immigrant. I wrote this book because I believe <strong>everyone can learn something about accepting what is, letting go of what is not working, and starting anew from immigrants.</strong><br/><br/>I hope that, in reading this book, you will discover the resiliency of a thirty-year-old immigrant woman and her journey to self-realization in a new country. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement I have for immigrants and the lessons of enduring change and achieving adaptation. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as <strong>a tool to help you unlock your superpowers when faced with a new situation that is unknown to you.</strong><br/><br/>I decided to write this book with hopes of helping other people, especially immigrants, keep track of their thoughts and relearn the lessons of the past as they walk through their journeys. On my journey as an immigrant, I have noticed the lessons on the road aren’t always clear. The realization only came to me recently as I started regularly meditating. While meditating, I investigated some of my memories and linked them to my behaviors today. Because of this realization, I can now try to relearn lessons of the past for myself and capture the process in this book to share it with others.<br/><br/>Investigating the past includes reflecting on my memories from before my immigration and comparing them with my life today. I call my approach <strong>“weaving the old world into the new world.”</strong><br/><br/>You might already know that the <strong>United States has a larger immigrant population than any other country</strong>, with 45 million immigrants as of 2018. This represents 16.5 percent of about 272 million international migrants globally in 2019, equating to about four percent of the global population. These numbers do not consider the estimated 740 million internal migrants in 2009 (UN, World Migration Report 2020).</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keen in <strong>understanding diverse experiences</strong>
</li>
<li>Interested in <strong>self/career development</strong>
</li>
<li>An immigrant yourself or are interested in learning about some aspects of the<strong> immigrant journey</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Curious about the origin of your thoughts and triggers</strong></li>
<li>Fan of stories that contain <strong>real-life experiences with a philosophical and psychological spin</strong> to them</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Immigrant communities are just like a coral reef, diverse, rich, and the value of their diversity in many ways is unknown.</strong> Similar to the bleached coral reefs, the diversity that comes into this country will eventually blend in and become one with the culture of their host society. Unpreserved and undocumented, this richness can be erased before it is acknowledged. The purpose of this book is to get a hold of the wealth that comes in with immigrants before it is too late.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Book - Immigrant</strong><br/><i>Immigrant </i>is written in three parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1: Immigration</strong> contains the introduction and chapters [1 - 4]. These initial stories mainly focus on the unclear state of mind we experience after going through a major change in our lives. The main character feels as if she has been dropped into the unknown and asks the question, “where am I?”</p>
<p><br/><strong>Part 2: Acculturation</strong> contains chapters [5 - 10]. These stories are mostly about adjusting to the new change. The main character feels the need to feel, act, and think similar to most Americans and attempts to forget about her past.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3: Integration </strong>contains chapters [11 - 16]. The focus of these last few chapters is on finding a balance and looking ahead. The main character finally cracks the code to be her authentic self and appreciate her multicultural and multilingual identity in America.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
""I have a faint memory of swallows from my childhood in Iran. I remember laying under the sun at my paternal grandparent’s terrace and imagining shapes out of the clouds when I saw a quick black bird with a strange tail decent in the sky. I asked my mother if the blackbird was also a pigeon because many of them coo coo-ed in my grandmothers’ trees.""
Immigrant is a book about change and adaptation which explores the personal and professional identities of a 30-year-old immigrant woman.My name is Golara Haghtalab and I am the author of Immigrant. I wrote this book because I believe everyone can learn something about accepting what is, letting go of what is not working, and starting anew from immigrants.I hope that, in reading this book, you will discover the resiliency of a thirty-year-old immigrant woman and her journey to self-realization in a new country. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement I have for immigrants and the lessons of enduring change and achieving adaptation. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you unlock your superpowers when faced with a new situation that is unknown to you.I decided to write this book with hopes of helping other people, especially immigrants, keep track of their thoughts and relearn the lessons of the past as they walk through their journeys. On my journey as an immigrant, I have noticed the lessons on the road aren’t always clear. The realization only came to me recently as I started regularly meditating. While meditating, I investigated some of my memories and linked them to my behaviors today. Because of this realization, I can now try to relearn lessons of the past for myself and capture the process in this book to share it with others.Investigating the past includes reflecting on my memories from before my immigration and comparing them with my life today. I call my approach “weaving the old world into the new world.”You might already know that the United States has a larger immigrant population than any other country, with 45 million immigrants as of 2018. This represents 16.5 percent of about 272 million international migrants globally in 2019, equating to about four percent of the global population. These numbers do not consider the estimated 740 million internal migrants in 2009 (UN, World Migration Report 2020).
You will love this book if you are:

Keen in understanding diverse experiences

Interested in self/career development

An immigrant yourself or are interested in learning about some aspects of the immigrant journey

Curious about the origin of your thoughts and triggers
Fan of stories that contain real-life experiences with a philosophical and psychological spin to them

 
Immigrant communities are just like a coral reef, diverse, rich, and the value of their diversity in many ways is unknown. Similar to the bleached coral reefs, the diversity that comes into this country will eventually blend in and become one with the culture of their host society. Unpreserved and undocumented, this richness can be erased before it is acknowledged. The purpose of this book is to get a hold of the wealth that comes in with immigrants before it is too late.
 
The Book - ImmigrantImmigrant is written in three parts.Part 1: Immigration contains the introduction and chapters [1 - 4]. These initial stories mainly focus on the unclear state of mind we experience after going through a major change in our lives. The main character feels as if she has been dropped into the unknown and asks the question, “where am I?”
Part 2: Acculturation contains chapters [5 - 10]. These stories are mostly about adjusting to the new change. The main character feels the need to feel, act, and think similar to most Americans and attempts to forget about her past.Part 3: Integration contains chapters [11 - 16]. The focus of these last few chapters is on finding a balance and looking ahead. The main character finally cracks the code to be her authentic self and appreciate her multicultural and multilingual identity in America.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>This book tells the story of how families have lived and learned to take control of their lives and provide for themselves and future generations using tools once reserved for the wealthy. I wrote this book as a way to help more families create or transform their nonexistent, simple, or incomplete estate plans to help protect their health, wealth, and happiness. My book will publish in July, 2020.</p>
<p>Over 100 books pre-ordered, less than 70 to go to publish in audiobook and hardcover!</p>
<p><strong>Trustworthy: The Evolution and Enlightenment of Modern Estate Estate Planning for Family Health, Wealth, Happiness and Love</strong><br/><br/>My name is Tara Wilson and I am the author of Trustworthy. I wrote this book because far too many Americans never put an estate plan in place simply because it seems confusing, overwhelming, and expensive.  It is also an emotional process. This book demystifies and simplifies estate planning to show why every American family is worthy of a trust.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that estate planning is not about death; it is about taking control of your life for the benefit of you, your family, and generations to come. Just like the entrepreneurial revolution has hit America, an estate planning enlightenment has swept throughout the country over the past twenty years, but it has not reached a tipping point where it is accessible or even understood by everyone, yet.<br/><br/>In this book, I hope to instill the same passion and excitement in you that I have for protecting families and their assets. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you take control of your life, your assets, and your legacy to help protect and provide for you and your family. My goal is to simplify the process and excite everyone to join this movement to help themselves and their families. This book simplifies the estate planning process to make it more understandable and economical so that everyone can take control of their lives, their assets and their legacy in an unprecedented fashion.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the best methods to take care of yourself and your family with estate planning, and more specifically, revocable living trusts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brynn experienced the loss of her mother and then her inheritance, most notably a home that had been in her family for generations, because her mother’s estate plan was not well thought out and discussed.</li>
<li>An original de Kooning painting worth $160 million was sold to a thrift store with a truckload full of other household belongings for $2,000 by a family member who wasn’t told there was anything valuable in the home.</li>
<li>A woman who failed to document her wishes in an estate plan lived in a brain-dead state for 15 years while her husband and parents went to war in the courts, legislatures, and public arena to determine what she would’ve wanted.</li>
<li>A family who had the forethought to organize their paperwork and establish trusts was able to privately protect themselves and three generations to come.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you want to learn what wealthy families have done for over a century to perpetuate their wealth.  This will teach you how to organize your life, protect yourself, your family and your assets, minimize the time, fees, hassles, and emotional issues during some of life’s inevitable events, and establish a legacy that will live on.<br/><br/><i>Trustworthy: The Evolution and Enlightenment of Modern Estate Planning for Family Health, Wealth, Happiness and Love</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to all Americans.  This will help shed traditional beliefs and teach everyone how to implement their estate planning and, more specifically, trusts, for the first time.</p>
<p>There are 5 parts to the book:</p>
<p>Part I contains the Introduction and Chapters 1-3. The Introduction gives an overview of how this topic impacts families.  It helps individuals to shift to a positive mindset, one that revolves around life, personal control, and peace of mind.  <br/><br/>Part II. Evolution contains Chapters 4-6. In this part, you will see the beginning of the evolution of estate planning from a point of procrastination and lack of knowledge in one generation and its impact on the next generation. These chapters focus on Brynn Robertson and her journey into adulthood, facing some of life’s most joyful moments and the depths of despair.<br/><br/>Part III. Enlightenment contains Chapters 7-10. In these chapters, Brynn’s story continues with her enlightenment from the lessons learned from her mother’s estate planning. Determined to do things differently, she takes control of her life and proactively plans for the expected and unexpected. This planning helps her get over her heartache and trust again, in large part because she shields herself from experiencing the financial ruin she previously faced.<br/><br/>Part IV. Keys to Happiness contains Chapters 11-13. These chapters focus on love, health and wealth. Chapter 11 focuses on love; your relationships with family and friends; caring for others and allowing them to care for you in time of need. Chapter 12 focuses on your financial wealth, both tangible and intangible. Chapter 13 shifts focus to your health and how some well-thought out decisions can help you and your family when you cannot speak for yourself, learning a valuable lesson from the story of Terri Schiavo.<br/><br/>Part V. Living Trustworthy contains Chapters 14-17. These chapters will guide you to form the foundation of your estate plan. Chapter 14 details the story of my estate plan evolution, one that you can replicate with a bit of legwork. Chapter 15 focuses on the legal foundation, the revocable living trust, that safeguards your assets and elaborates on the guidelines for you and future generations.  It teaches you how to not make the same mistakes as one of America’s richest families, the Vanderbilts. Chapter 16 leads back to your assets and some more legwork, this time organizing and aligning those assets with your new revocable living trust. Chapter 17 takes your estate planning to the next level by leaving a legacy.<br/> </p>

I decided to write this book, because I want to give insights into how we can harness our brain, and past experiences to improve our internal growth. What makes my perspective different in my book, is that I am able to provide a framework to help you better understand how to implement 6 principles into our daily lifestyle! Such examples involve technology and our social interactions.<br/><br/>This book also explores the intersections of intentionality with imagination, self-care, self-control, fear, as well as time management, and habits. My goal is to explain how they interconnect, and can be exercised into a proactive lifestyle.<br/><br/>This book includes stories, from some of the world’s most successful people such as</p><ul>
<li>Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson (author of The 12 Rules for Life)</li>
<li>Motivational speaker Mel Robbins (author of 5 Second Rule)</li>
<li>Retired Navy Seal David Goggins</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>My hope for this book is that readers will get a new perspective from my framework to have a better understanding of how to organize their ideas and actions and how to make the necessary adjustments to improve on certain bad habits.<br/><br/>You will enjoy this book if you are a motivated individual searching for a calling or a direction in your life, and also have a relevant background of the neuroscience of our brains. The interesting details I share are real life examples of motivational experiences within <i>The Brain Hut </i>framework.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Askholes: How to give first and network later to build valuable relationships.<br/><br/>My name is Kasra Khalili and I am the author of Askholes. I wrote this book because in my journey as an entrepreneur I’ve learned the hard way that networking is broken. I went on a journey that’s led me to launch a startup, run an event series, and a build a community from scratch.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that giving can be your key to meet anyone. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for giving first and building relationships in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you stop networking and start connecting with people in a whole new way.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about give-first networking and harnessing your community:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the intention behind every interaction you may have</li>
<li>Identifying your value-add and how it can be delivered to everyone you meet</li>
<li>Applying a give first approach in your interactions</li>
<li>Learning from others is a gift, not a weakness, and the art of asking for help</li>
<li>Building sustainable connections on trust resulting in lifelong relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you love connecting with others and learning from the stories of entrepreneurs.<br/><br/>Askholes is a non-fiction book that speaks to entrepreneurs and leaders who are looking at growing their network in an authentic way and building a community of support around themselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Askholes</h3>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + additional chapters. This section covers the history of networking, the types of networks around us, and where we go today to build those connections. We’ll dive into the pros and cons of our current networks, as well as, the story of LinkedIn’s rise on the scene and how their early team sought to redefine professional connections.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters 7-10. Give first is at the heart of how we’re changing our approach to building connections, and ultimately valuable relationships. I share the story of Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit, and where giving immense value to both his team and users that launched a network effect of the ages.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains Chapters 11-14. Finally, we go deeper into how we as entrepreneurs, community builders, leaders, and individuals from all walks of life can redefine our own value, package it into our personal brand, and connect like never before. We see how Elon Musk uses tactics of giving to meet who he needs to launch his empire.<br/><br/>Each part dives into the stories and research I've conducted to share real life examples of how they are used. Connection is now a tool available to all us, regardless of experience or status.<h3> </h3>

We can create robots to act like robot, we need humans to act like humans.</p><p>We need to stop burning and churning through our best and brightest. It's stupid; petty and de-humanizing.</p><p>So I dug into the research and created some easy, accessible tools both for leaders, individual contributors, and everyone in between. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what gives you flow energy, learn how to maintain the boundaries that help you channel that flow, and increase your impact. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for being productive and adding value. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you learn to</p><ul>
<li>use your feelings as data and align with your goals</li>
<li>use the flow checklist to take action to get you back into the flow,</li>
<li>finally understand understand how the oppositional nature of the creative brain may be hold you make -- and how mindful awareness can help you skip the catch-22, double BS that traps way too many. </li>
</ul><h3>In this book, you'll learn:</h3><p>You are not alone. A lot of amazing folks from Larry Page to Sallie Krawcheck have been caught in the bizarro land of double binds and Catch-22s. While being in this situation feels shitty - you’ll learn to recognize these situations and access mindful self-awareness tools to “Keep Calm and Prove the Irrelevance of Hierarchy.”</p><p>You'll learn how to defend your boundaries and “flow channel.”  Learn how to play the game right and how to get out of bizarro recursive mind traps (both your own and others). Stoping playing life on the default settings. Understand and own your truth. Own your duality and muchness, Be intimidating and humble. Awe-inspiring and curious. Overwhelming and enough. Fierce and kind. Critical and caring. This, dear hearts, is the secret of buoyancy and power. The tension between these seeming paradoxes is what creates energy. </p><p>You will love this book if you are both creative and analytical, fierce and kind, brave and vulnerable, curious and knowledgeable, a lone wolf and pack wolf.</p><p><strong>The Book - Applied Flow: Practical Tools for Doing Your Best Work, Creating Flow and Preventing Burnout</strong></p><p>The book is written in 4 Parts</p><ul>

Since seventh grade, I have been paid to write. I walked into my hometown newspaper office and was paid $1.50 for a report on my scout troop’s weekend camping trip. I am an award-winning former newspaper publisher and editor, communication strategist, and award-winning independent author. I lend my talents to families, helping with obituary notices and eulogies, and I help speakers with speeches and presentations. I still write love letters to my wife of 34 years.</p><p>I am a native of metro Atlanta (Cumming, GA), and a 1981 graduate of the University of Georgia. My family relocated to Lexington, SC (near Columbia) in 1991. Our four sons were raised in Lexington. Learn more about me at <a href=""http://www.scottdvaughan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">scottdvaughan.com</a>.</p><p>I love baseball.</p><p>Here's the thing. I only played for three years, between the ages of 8-10. I was terrible. Despite being a terrible player, I loved the game. My first newspaper job, while in high school, was as a sports writer. I eventually moved into news reporting, but always kept a hand in sports writing.</p><p>I was the last person Terry Thompson should have asked to be a volunteer baseball coach back in 1982.  I will forever be thankful that he did. Over the next 30 years, coaching in three communities, my teams won 70 percent of the time. Looking back, I do wonder, ""How in the world did that happen? To me?"" </p><p>My new book, NINE INNINGS, was actually the first book I started writing. The idea came out of my love for baseball, the fun I had while coaching boys ages 9-12, and the lessons I learned about life. I paused NINE INNINGS, in 2014, to write what became Brookwood Road, and then three other books followed. In 2020, it became time to reach back and finish NINE INNINGS. Here's a summary.</p><p><i><strong>A Summary of Nine Innings</strong></i><br/><i>There’s a melancholy that’s settled on Frank Wilcox as he enters the Empty Nest chapter of his life. His four sons are grown and gone, and with them went a 30-year span of coaching boy’s baseball in three different communities across the South. Life is suddenly quiet, and the quiet is maddening. As baseball season begins, Frank has an idea – he will travel to Turner Field in Atlanta and attend a Braves game all by himself. It’s during that game that Frank is reminded of the memories: a miraculous comeback, an answered prayer, a friendly mortician, a fox in the outfield, a search for new catcher’s equipment, four-piece chicken baskets, and draft strategy. Frank remembers hundreds of players with nicknames like Spongebob, Big G, Killer, E-Mar, Jet, Snooky, Hoss, Ace, Big A, Sugarman, and Vegas. The Braves game becomes a time of healing for Frank, and his return to Concord launches a new chapter in this life. </i></p><p>This IndieGogo campaign is to raise $5,000 to fund NINE INNINGS' publication. Funds will pay for professional services, including cover design, editing and proofreading, interior formatting for print and Kindle editions, and advertising availability of the book. My desire in publishing is to present high-quality, bookstore-quality books that are well-written, well-edited and thoughtfully marketed. Though independently published, I like to envision my books in bookstores maintaining the same quality as corporately published books. I personally funded my first four books, and this campaign allows for partnerships in publishing the fifth book.</p><p>I believe my novels can be read for pure enjoyment and fun. Still, I also believe there’s a greater message within them, whether it’s the importance of faith, family, friends, the mystery of romance, or the value of service and community. I hope readers have fun with my stories but are also moved in some measurable way to appreciate the past and present and look toward the future. Contributors to this campaign will help achieve this goal.</p><h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3><p>The book is written.<br/>To offset publishing costs, I am looking to raise $5,000 to pay for the following professional services.</p><p><strong>Cover Design ($300.00)</strong><br/>I contract with Graham Publishing Company, of Denver, CO, to help with cover design. This includes front, back, and spinal design and adjusting the cover to fit around the final book size before publishing. My goal is to have a cover that is bookstore-quality. Utilizing a publishing company ensures great graphic design and graphic design that is on point with publishing. I do not have a personal relationship with Graham Publishing Company, its partners, or employees, ensuring arms-length service not clouded by relationship.</p><p><strong>Formal Edit &amp; Proofreading ($2,000.00)</strong><br/>I contract with Stacey Lenn of Birmingham, AL as my formal editor and proofreader. The formal edit is a line-by-line edit for grammar, spelling, factual consistency, and clarity. I am provided with the ability to accept, reject, or rewrite around each editing suggestion.

</ul><h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3><p>I was blessed to be born into a family of readers. My blue-collar dad was an unofficial speed-reader and read dozens of books each year until he died at age 76. His farming parents were also readers. My mother is a lifelong reader – the daughter of a public educator. One of my earliest memories is learning to read mail-order Dr. Seuss books with my dad. I still have the first book I bought with my own money, a hardback, titled ‘Great Catchers of the Major Leagues.’ As a school-age boy, I often read multiple library books each week and spent many summer afternoons at the local public library. From my love for reading came a love to write my own fictional stories, which led to a newspaper career because I could be paid to write.</p><p>Reading is important. Reading strengthens vocabulary, decision-making, storytelling, and education. It is crucial for the advancement of our society. We all know that books help fuel reading. I believe my books entertain people and present authenticity around issues like faith, family, friendships, and community.</p><p>I have successfully published four books. All four books are available on amazon.com, through my website, and at select retail gift shops.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607091203/rk7drsmwvfxnuevgx3ly.png"" src=""""/></p><ul>

<strong>Brookwood Road</strong> (2014) has more than 50 strong reviews on amazon.com. It was a finalist in the Readers’ Favorite Book Award Contest and a finalist in the National Indie Excellence Awards.</li>
<li>
<strong>Elm Street</strong> (2016) was a finalist in both the National Indie Excellence Awards and Book Excellence Awards contests, as well as a four-star finalist in the Indie Reader Discovery Awards contest.</li>

<strong>The Beauty Queen &amp; The Reporter</strong> (2019) (a novella) won a second-place award in the Readers’ Favorite Book Award Contest.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><p>The greatest challenge to independent publishing is financing the project's publication. I have self-funded four projects, and the cost of publication often provides very little additional funding for advertising, promotion, contests, and inventory. Involving more people in this journey will provide a better book launch.</p><p>The greatest risk to this project is my death or serious illness. My son William, a creative artist and writer in his own right, is a silent critic and supporter of my independent publishing work. In my death or serious illness, William will assume the publisher role and ensure the book is published and marketed appropriately.</p><h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3><p>Beyond funding assistance, there are ways that people can help this effort.</p><ul>
<li>Like my Facebook page and follow me on Instagram. Help by liking, commenting, and sharing posts about the book. With sharing, add your own two-sentence endorsement.</li>
<li>Read the book and write a short review or endorsement on the book’s amazon.com page. Reviews help circulation.</li>
<li>Invite me to visit with your book club – even through a virtual online meeting using a platform like zoom or Skype.</li>

Reading strengthens vocabulary, decision-making, storytelling, and education. It is crucial for the advancement of our society. We all know that books help fuel reading. I believe my books entertain people and present authenticity around issues like faith, family, friendships, and community.I have successfully published four books. All four books are available on amazon.com, through my website, and at select retail gift shops.

Brookwood Road (2014) has more than 50 strong reviews on amazon.com. It was a finalist in the Readers’ Favorite Book Award Contest and a finalist in the National Indie Excellence Awards.

Elm Street (2016) was a finalist in both the National Indie Excellence Awards and Book Excellence Awards contests, as well as a four-star finalist in the Indie Reader Discovery Awards contest.

Hickory Trail (2018) was a finalist in the National Indie Excellence Awards contest.

The Beauty Queen & The Reporter (2019) (a novella) won a second-place award in the Readers’ Favorite Book Award Contest.
Risks & ChallengesThe greatest challenge to independent publishing is financing the project's publication. I have self-funded four projects, and the cost of publication often provides very little additional funding for advertising, promotion, contests, and inventory. Involving more people in this journey will provide a better book launch.The greatest risk to this project is my death or serious illness. My son William, a creative artist and writer in his own right, is a silent critic and supporter of my independent publishing work. In my death or serious illness, William will assume the publisher role and ensure the book is published and marketed appropriately.Other Ways You Can HelpBeyond funding assistance, there are ways that people can help this effort.

<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong><i>– Rugged Republic: American Individualism and the Makings of Our Collective Crisis</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About the Book</h3>
<p><i>Rugged Republic </i>is a passionate and personal analysis on why America's obsession with individualism threatens our future. Our ability to rise to the occasion in these moments of crisis depends on our ability to cooperate and come together, yet we are divided, isolated, and lonelier than ever. America is atomized and we have rugged individualism to blame.</p>
<p>For several decades, our policies and politics have broken down our social bonds and connections and emphasized a need to focus on our own self-interest, making it impossible for us to come together in times we need it most. Though ""rugged individualism"" is often cited as integral to the American mindset and psyche, it in fact hinders effective policymaking and justifies our nation's lack of empathy and disregard for the welfare of our fellow Americans. And from state capitol protests to grocery store fights over masks, COVID-19 put this on full display.<br/><br/>My name is Lucas Rivers and I am the author of <i>Rugged Republic: American Individualism and the Makings of Our Collective Crisis</i>, a book that began in the early weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown as we tried to make sense of the tragedies unfolding around us. In reading this book, I hope to shed light on why American individualism is responsible for our failed response to the coronavirus pandemic and why, unless we act, we will fail the collective challenges that await us in the 21st century – the climate emergency, economic inequality, and social injustice. I hope that, in reading this book, readers will recognize that the hyper-individualism that has taken over our society threatens our country’s future, but that not all hope is lost if we act now.</p>

<h3>A Sneak Peek into <i>Rugged Republic</i>
</h3>
<p><strong>Part 1: In a Time of Monsters </strong>explores our cultural history of “rugged individualism” — from the frontier spirit of the pioneers to the entrepreneurial tenacity of Silicon Valley. And it shows how changes in our economic policies and political philosophies in the late 20th century ushered in a new era of free-market thinking that not only radicalized our individualist tendencies but thrived on our pursuit of self-interest and the breakdown of the common good. When combined with the new tools and technologies of the digital world, we find ourselves face-to-face with the monsters that have torn apart American society.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2: The Atomized American </strong>offers a series of portraits around the roles we all inhabit as individuals in the American project — citizen, neighbor, consumer, and worker — and how a new and exaggerated form of American individualism has introduced itself in every aspect of our lives. In each of these roles, the reader will see authentic examples and lived experiences of how this hyper-radicalized sense of individualism has chipped away at the social bonds, public interest, and common good needed to stave off disaster in the 21st century.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3: Towards a Solidarity State</strong> shows how we must embrace the task of developing an alternative vision for America’s future that builds upon cooperation, collaboration, and a renewed sense of the public interest. We must abandon the rugged republic and pursue the full realization of what I call the <i>solidarity state </i>— a new vision of the American project with policies and practices that foster social connections, distributes resources and power, renews active citizenship, rebalances our public and private sectors, and rebuilds a sense of security and safety for all Americans.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Memoirs and fictional accounts of 1960s and beyond counterculture have emerged almost as a subgenre in contemporary literature. Through Thorns fits in that category and will appeal to those who were involved in or exposed to alternative lifestyles 'back in the day.'</p>

<h3><strong>The Story of <i>Back to Me</i></strong></h3>
<p>Have you ever looked in the mirror and not recognized the person staring back at you? If so, this book is a breadcrumb meant to lead you back to the real <i>you</i>.<br/><br/>My name is Chandra Kennett and I’m the author of <i>Back To Me</i>, a memoir in which I share a lifetime of lessons, both learned and unlearned, on the journey back to myself. This book explores how unresolved childhood trauma can lead to a midlife “crisis,” and eventually, a renaissance. A reawakening to your true self. The realization of <i>who</i> you are and <i>what </i>you want.<br/><br/>In <i>Back to Me</i>, I share personal stories, along with the lessons that became clear in retrospect. A lifetime of hiding and people-pleasing led me into some precarious situations, but through years of healing work and personal growth, I’m now able to share my stories from a different perspective. Although hard at times to write, I promise to show you how I persevered and eventually, made my way back to me.<br/><br/>My hope is that <i>Back to Me</i> becomes a permission slip for you to figure out what you really want and to remember who you really are. I also hope it helps you understand that your past does not dictate your present, or your future. You are in control of your happiness.<br/><br/>This book is for you if you’ve ever felt stuck, lost, or fed-up. If you’ve ever felt like the passenger, rather than the captain of your own life. If you’ve ever felt like you weren’t worthy of dreaming big, or of being truly happy. Because, spoiler alert, you are worthy of all that and more. You are worthy simply because you are you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About Chandra</strong></h3>
<p>Chandra Kennett is a recovering people pleaser and recovering cubicle dweller. She is the proud owner of Moonshine Communications, an agency specializing in social media management. She is also a certified life and career coach, proud mom of two super cool kids, and a self-proclaimed pop culture nerd.<br/><br/>Chandra always wanted to be an author and took advantage of the slowed pace of a global pandemic to put her dream into motion. She is fascinated by the human condition and how healing one’s past can positively impact one’s future. Personal development and self actualization are her jam.<br/><br/>When she’s not reading or writing, Chandra feels most like herself in a yoga class or on a hike in the mountains of her adopted home state, New Hampshire. Travel, deep conversations, and music light her soul on fire, and Mexican food is her love language.</p>

</div></div>","The Story of Back to Me
Have you ever looked in the mirror and not recognized the person staring back at you? If so, this book is a breadcrumb meant to lead you back to the real you.My name is Chandra Kennett and I’m the author of Back To Me, a memoir in which I share a lifetime of lessons, both learned and unlearned, on the journey back to myself. This book explores how unresolved childhood trauma can lead to a midlife “crisis,” and eventually, a renaissance. A reawakening to your true self. The realization of who you are and what you want.In Back to Me, I share personal stories, along with the lessons that became clear in retrospect. A lifetime of hiding and people-pleasing led me into some precarious situations, but through years of healing work and personal growth, I’m now able to share my stories from a different perspective. Although hard at times to write, I promise to show you how I persevered and eventually, made my way back to me.My hope is that Back to Me becomes a permission slip for you to figure out what you really want and to remember who you really are. I also hope it helps you understand that your past does not dictate your present, or your future. You are in control of your happiness.This book is for you if you’ve ever felt stuck, lost, or fed-up. If you’ve ever felt like the passenger, rather than the captain of your own life. If you’ve ever felt like you weren’t worthy of dreaming big, or of being truly happy. Because, spoiler alert, you are worthy of all that and more. You are worthy simply because you are you.
 
About Chandra
Chandra Kennett is a recovering people pleaser and recovering cubicle dweller. She is the proud owner of Moonshine Communications, an agency specializing in social media management. She is also a certified life and career coach, proud mom of two super cool kids, and a self-proclaimed pop culture nerd.Chandra always wanted to be an author and took advantage of the slowed pace of a global pandemic to put her dream into motion. She is fascinated by the human condition and how healing one’s past can positively impact one’s future. Personal development and self actualization are her jam.When she’s not reading or writing, Chandra feels most like herself in a yoga class or on a hike in the mountains of her adopted home state, New Hampshire. Travel, deep conversations, and music light her soul on fire, and Mexican food is her love language.
