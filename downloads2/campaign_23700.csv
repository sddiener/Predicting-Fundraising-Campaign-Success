<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Matt Growden and I have two decades of professional experience performing magic for real people.  With a degree in chemistry, most of my presentational ""hooks"" revolve around science... or science fiction.  After all, it was Arthur C Clark who said ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"". </p>
<p>My passion is not only to entertain, but to inspire. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Need more local audiences!  </p>
<p>Thanks to out of town corporate sponsors, this project exceeded it's monetary goal.  But I do not consider Pop Up Magic a success because engagement of the local Huntsville community has been low.  It's no fun planning, writing and rehearsing a show that no one sees. </p>
<p>So here's the next chapter for this project:</p>
<p><strong>One show will launch for every additional $50 raised OR each 5 new contributors.</strong>  That's right, you and four friends can go the ultra-budget route and experience your very own show for $5.  (But you might want to up your game a little and claim a perk).  </p>
<p><strong>Heck, if you message me, e-mail or call asking for a FREE ""Time Travel"" show and can guarantee that at least five people will show up, I will probably do it. </strong></p>
<p>At this point, the community engagement is more important than the money (although again, I must point out that there are some pretty sweet perks).</p>
<p>""Time Travel"" is an exclusive 15 minute close-up magic show to be performed in the downtown Huntsville Square.  Dates, and times will be announced on my website and the Matt Growden Magic Facebook page.</p>
<p>Another show ""Mind Games"" is in the works.  So when Time Travel runs it's course, we will just keep this crowdfunded party rolling ...</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Obviously, this project has a lot to do with self promotion within the local community.  But my intent is also to just raise general awareness and respect for magic as a performing art. It is also an experiment in public entertainment.  Instead of busking, think of Pop Up Magic as ""prepaid"" street performance. </p>
<p>My hope is that this project will also inspire continued corporate and/or city sponsorship of variety performing arts in public spaces. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Hmm... really none.  Either I connect with a  group of magic aficionados in Huntsville, or not.... I know you all are out there, because I have already met some of you.  We might have to reschedule shows due to bad weather (which is a real possibility here in Alabama).   But apart from those concerns, the show has already been rehearsed and the script written.  I just need an audience.... </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. If you cannot monetarily contribute at this time, that's OK!  Please tell your rich friends, family and co-workers about my campaign... and maybe they will let you tag along for a show.  Share this indiegogo link on your social media!  Check out my website and Facebook page for public performances at area restaurants and taprooms.  The Pop Up Magic shows will not be repeated, but at least for the price of a beer you can see some of my ""regular"" magic :)</p>

We now have a videographer and makeup/hair artist lined up for the production and the costumes are well under way. Please continue to share! Only a few hours left! :-)</i></p><p><i>***Be sure to check out the Updates page for more developments and pictures!!!</i></p><p><b>Hello
there! </b></p>
<p>My name is Hanna Rose, and I want to thank you for visiting
our Indiegogo campaign! I am writing on behalf of a group of San Francisco
based artists who are in the process of producing a new one act
multidisciplinary performance. The title of the show is <i>That Thing at That Place with That Person</i> and it is a part of the
Resident Artist Workshop (RAW) series at The Garage in San Francisco which will
be performed on April 9&amp;10, 2014 at 8:00PM. As the choreographer, I am the
artist in residence. However, it is my dream to bring artists of various
disciplines together in order to create a unique performance experience for the
audience.</p>
<p> I cannot emphasize
enough what a collaborative process this has been and continues to be. I am
honored to be working closely with six very talented dancers in order to generate
unique, organic material, that I can then mold and shape in order to tell a
story (Please check out their bios below!). I am also collaborating with local
designer, Chad Leal, to create beautiful one of a kind costumes. Lastly, I have
employed the help of two of my fabulous siblings. My sister, Hailey, is quite
the poet, having some of her work already published at the age of 18. We will
be using some of her work (spoken and possibly projected) throughout the piece.
My brother, Joel, on the other hand, is the musician of the family. He and his
band have composed a series of songs that we will be using as part of our
musical accompaniment. </p>
<p>I hope that you have watched our video, and I urge you to
read on and learn more about this unique collaborative project. Your comments
and support are greatly appreciated!</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>What
is the project?</b></p>
<p><i>That
Thing at That Place with That Person</i> is a theatrical dance
performance created through the collaboration of several artists. The piece
journeys through the experiences of six unique characters, whose personalities
and costumes have been defined by the personification of physical objects and animals.
The six identities include: thimble, flower, skeleton, blackbird, candle, and
wave. I am working closely with our costume designer and dancers to create a
distinct visual look and unique movement quality for each of these characters. The
performance will explore the interactions of these characters with each other
and themselves, delving into universal human emotions and experiences. We are
anticipating the completed work to run about 20 minutes. Stay tuned for updates
and come see the live performance on April 9&amp;10 to learn more!  </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>What
do we need?</b></p>
<p>There are many factors that go into producing a
professional performance, and it is with the help of friends, family members,
and other supporters of the arts that such work is made possible. It is going
to cost $4000 to bring my dream to life. That $4000 will be used toward
production costs such as costume design and construction and professional video
documentation of the performance. Donations of any amount are graciously
accepted. As a token of our appreciation for your generosity, all donors will
receive a link to an online sneak preview of the production.  </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Think
Big!</b></p>
<p>$4000 is our minimum goal and with that we will be able
put on the show. However, this project has the potential for so much more.
Please spread the word and help us to reach our larger goal of $5000. All funds
raised go directly to enhancing the performance experience for the audience
members. Additional funding would be used for developments such as hiring a
makeup artist, hiring an actor for spoken word and narration, and/or rental of
professional audio recording equipment. </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Ways
you can help! </b></p>
<p>Yes, we need the money, but there are other
ways to help out as well. Here is a list of all the ways that you can help this
project grow to its fullest potential. </p>
<p>  1)

<p></p></div>","THIS JUST IN!!! We now have a videographer and makeup/hair artist lined up for the production and the costumes are well under way. Please continue to share! Only a few hours left! :-)***Be sure to check out the Updates page for more developments and pictures!!!Hello
there! 
My name is Hanna Rose, and I want to thank you for visiting
our Indiegogo campaign! I am writing on behalf of a group of San Francisco
based artists who are in the process of producing a new one act
multidisciplinary performance. The title of the show is That Thing at That Place with That Person and it is a part of the
Resident Artist Workshop (RAW) series at The Garage in San Francisco which will
be performed on April 9&10, 2014 at 8:00PM. As the choreographer, I am the
artist in residence. However, it is my dream to bring artists of various
disciplines together in order to create a unique performance experience for the
audience.
 I cannot emphasize
enough what a collaborative process this has been and continues to be. I am
honored to be working closely with six very talented dancers in order to generate
unique, organic material, that I can then mold and shape in order to tell a
story (Please check out their bios below!). I am also collaborating with local
designer, Chad Leal, to create beautiful one of a kind costumes. Lastly, I have
employed the help of two of my fabulous siblings. My sister, Hailey, is quite
the poet, having some of her work already published at the age of 18. We will
be using some of her work (spoken and possibly projected) throughout the piece.
My brother, Joel, on the other hand, is the musician of the family. He and his
band have composed a series of songs that we will be using as part of our
musical accompaniment. 
I hope that you have watched our video, and I urge you to
read on and learn more about this unique collaborative project. Your comments
and support are greatly appreciated!
What
is the project?
That
Thing at That Place with That Person is a theatrical dance
performance created through the collaboration of several artists. The piece
journeys through the experiences of six unique characters, whose personalities
and costumes have been defined by the personification of physical objects and animals.
The six identities include: thimble, flower, skeleton, blackbird, candle, and
wave. I am working closely with our costume designer and dancers to create a
distinct visual look and unique movement quality for each of these characters. The
performance will explore the interactions of these characters with each other
and themselves, delving into universal human emotions and experiences. We are
anticipating the completed work to run about 20 minutes. Stay tuned for updates
and come see the live performance on April 9&10 to learn more!  
What
do we need?
There are many factors that go into producing a
professional performance, and it is with the help of friends, family members,
and other supporters of the arts that such work is made possible. It is going
to cost $4000 to bring my dream to life. That $4000 will be used toward
production costs such as costume design and construction and professional video
documentation of the performance. Donations of any amount are graciously
accepted. As a token of our appreciation for your generosity, all donors will
receive a link to an online sneak preview of the production.  
Think
Big!
$4000 is our minimum goal and with that we will be able
put on the show. However, this project has the potential for so much more.
Please spread the word and help us to reach our larger goal of $5000. All funds
raised go directly to enhancing the performance experience for the audience
members. Additional funding would be used for developments such as hiring a
makeup artist, hiring an actor for spoken word and narration, and/or rental of
professional audio recording equipment. 
Ways
you can help! 
Yes, we need the money, but there are other
ways to help out as well. Here is a list of all the ways that you can help this
project grow to its fullest potential.

</div></div>","Our Story


When you infuse spoken word into a soul rockin' musical, you get A Taste of Chocolate. Believing there is more to life than becoming a small town preacher in Alabama, this tale follows Kofi through dance, rhythm and rhyme as he journeys to Hollywood to find his own voice. 


A TASTE OF CHOCOLATE, an original musical written by Timothy Ware, has been invited to make its NYC premier this July at the Midtown International Theatre Festival (MITF).

Every summer in midtown Manhattan, MITF celebrates the diversity of theatre in New York City and beyond. MITF welcomes theatrical storytelling across a broad spectrum of genres, forms, identities, cultures, and appetites. The MITF proudly hosts production companies from across the country and around the globe, uniting talent in one of the biggest theatre capitals in the world. 


The Impact


This festival will not only be used as a platform for Timothy Ware to showcase A TASTE OF CHOCOLATE, but it will be an introduction of himself to the NYC theatrical community as a playwright.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">It's summer! (Almost) </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">And Terra Firma is getting ready to roll up our sleeves and make some  more dynamic, invigorating theatre!</h3>
<div>We've got an incredibly exciting few months planned. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>First, we will be at The Figment Festival, performing our newest show, <i>Manuscripts Don't Burn</i>. It will run for free on Governors Island in June! This show will wander through the nooks and crannies of the island's historic architecture, filling the air with the magic, music, and devilish characters of Bulgakov's imagination.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Then, in August, we are back up in the Catskill Mountains, for our second artists retreat. This time the focus is on the playwright. What kind of work can a writer create when removed from the distractions of the city? How will the plays grow, when there is a whole group of actors assembled to work solely on the playwright's new pages? These questions will be answered over the seven day retreat, when three playwrights and four actors will live, breathe, and work new theatre. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This summer, we will continue to create and produce the work we are known for - work that is collaborative, challenging, and adventurous. If this is enough to spark your support, give now, using the button on the top right. If you want to know more, read on for the details!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We thank you for your generous support! It's going to be a very creative, collaborative few months!</div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Manuscripts Don't Burn</h3>
<div>The Figment Festival approached us in December about performing a site-specific show on Governors Island this summer. We, of course leapt at the chance to work in such a pristine, historic location. And we knew exactly what the piece should be about... </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mikhail Bulgakov. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Our dramaturgs, Rob Cohn and Colin Mannex, teamed up and began to furiously pour over Bulgakov's literature and documents. Working along side director Anna Jones, the three began shaping a story out of the masses of source texts that we had compiled. Among some of the texts which they pulled from are: The Master and Margarita, Dead Man's Memoir, The White Guard, Diaboliad, Morphine, and Flight of the Turbans.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>To flesh out the literature, Joe Osheroff and Puppet Kitchen agreed to come on board to build original masks and puppets. Katie Vida and Boris Chesakov, two exceptionally innovative visual artists, will be designing the sets and props. Rebecca Welles, with the help of Liz Maher, will be creating our costumes. Actors Alexandra O'Daly, Ben Weber, Sophia Holman, Stephanie Bratnick, Ryan King, Ken King, and Stephanie Hayes are taking on the principle roles. They will be joined by 10 other actors and a few musicians, who will help flesh out the rest of the play.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And so, with our team all lined up at the starting line... </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>                     We are off to Governors Island to begin this wild journey of creation!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>THE Story</h3>
<div>Manuscripts Don't Burn is a visceral romp through one writer's over-active imagination, where devils are your hosts, cats have human appetites, puppets are suicidal, and the best literary talents can't seem to catch a break. This 80 minute roving theatrical installation is cultivated from Mikhail Bulgakov's writings, including Master and Margarita, The Diaboliad, and The White Guard. Masks, puppets, and musicians create a world of shadow-agents and supernatural obstacles. As the journey unfolds, our audience follows a forlorn writer, tormented by his talent and wild fantasies. In each room, another puzzle piece of the story is revealed. Behind each door lies a secret waiting to be whispered to the audience through imagery, language, and movement. These fragmented vignettes slowly build together to reveal the true heart of our writer's plight and his fantastical redemption.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Trapped in a bureaucratic world, our hero faces unnerving challenges that--despite their surreality--inform our perspective on the difficulties facing artists in our own culture. How do we fight an oppressive regime when the drive for censorship takes hold in our hearts?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Our Company</h3>
<p>Terra Firma Theatre Company is dedicated to sustainable artistic practice with a deep rooted commitment to the creation of new work. By creating, working, and living outside of the city for specific periods of time before bringing our work back to a larger audience, the company is able to dig further into our imaginations and challenge ourselves deeper. By utilizing whatever environment and tools we have at our immediate disposal, our ensemble strives to create theatre of exceptional quality that is aesthetically challenging and innovative, as well as being developed and produced in a unique and sustainable way.</p>

<h3>The Festival and Terra Firma</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The Figment Festival is a visual art festival that, since 2007, takes over Governors Island for three days each summer. Each year thousands of people attend to see the hundreds of art exhibits that fill every corner of the island.They encourage the artists to create work the patrons can participate in, blending the traditional rules of creator and audience. Their website describes it like this:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"">FIGMENT is an explosion of creative energy. It’s a free, annual celebration of participatory art and culture where everything is possible. For one weekend each summer, it transforms Governors Island into a large-scale collaborative artwork – and then it’s gone.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;""><br/></span></div>
<p>We got so excited about Figment, we decided to weave these principals into the fabric of our show. To us, theatre offers the unique opportunity to take all the art disciplines and mesh them together. We wanted to make the creation and performance of this play a truly collaborative undertaking. This is why we have pulled from so many art forms to create the play.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>But why stop there? Figment offered us the challenge and opportunity to investigate how the audience participates in the creation of performance. By removing the barriers of a legitimate stage, our patrons are free to participate fully in the unfolding of our story. The line between who is making the art and who is watching it becomes blurred, since there is no physical boundary between performer and observer. We are also considering passing out disposable cameras to many of the audience members. These individuals would be encouraged and asked to take photos as they journey through the play. Each individual's significant and unique vantage point would be documented through the photographs they take. Thus, they are simultaneously making their own artwork, as they are experiencing art being made. These photos will be developed by the company and posted on our website following the show.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Help us make this show a reality! This entire show is being created on the small budget of $4,700. And we only have $3,000 left to raise!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>$5, $10, $20, or $100 donations will go directly to helping us fill in the missing $3,500! And make sure you check out the amazing incentives you will receive when you donate! Details are listed on the right column. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Read below to find out exactly where your money will be going -</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Because we believe it is important for artists to be compensated for their passion, talent, and hard work, $2,000 of this budget is going directly towards actor stipends. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>$1,300 is going to designing the show. We have been very lucky to be accepted by Materials For The Arts as a member. They receive donations from all over the country of anything from office supplies to paint to wood to props. Then, non-profit art companies like us, get to use these materials for free to make our work! But we still need funds to design the beautiful costumes designed by Rebecca Welles. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The final $1,400 goes towards the rental of rehearsal space and transportation to and from the island. Because of the amount of people participating in the show, as well as the puppets and mask work we are incorporating, it is vital we have large dance spaces to play in. These spaces coast anywhere from $8 - $30 an hour. And we need to pay for over 100 hours of rehearsal! We will also need to rent vans to move our set, costumes, and artists on and off the island via the free ferry.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Anything we raise over our initial budget will go to supporting our writers during the August retreat!</div>

<p>The Lonny Chapman Group Repertory Theatre is a membership company of Actors, Directors and Playwrights operating under the 99-Seat Actors Equity Waiver Plan. We have been in continuous operation for 38 years. In that time we have produced over 180 productions, including more than 40 original world premieres. Our membership dues and ticket sale revenues account for only half of our annual budget.  The remainder of our operating expenses are drawn from donations. This is where our campaign comes in to play.</p>
<p>The Group Rep is proud to be presenting Charles Marowitz’ “Sherlock’s Last Case” directed by Larry Eisenberg, produced by Drina Durazo.  Picking up where Arthur Conan Doyle's stories ended, the play centers on a death threat against Holmes by the ""son"" of his late nemesis, Professor Moriarty. Oddly enough, however, Holmes is warned of the plot by Moriarity's ""daughter,"" to whom Holmes (who turns out to be quite a ladies man) is strongly attracted. The plot twists and turns until Holmes finds himself imprisoned in a dank cellar, trapped and for the first time in his illustrious career surprised by human behavior.  Part spoof, part loving tribute...all fun!</p>
<p>We are attempting to raise <strong>$2,500</strong> to underwrite the production costs of “Sherlock’s Last Case.” This will include the cost of the <strong>royalties</strong> and <strong>costume design</strong>. With a character as tremendously popular as Sherlock Holmes, you can imagine that obtaining the rights to put on this production could get pretty pricey. His name may not be the first to come to mind when it comes to super heroes, but he’s the first person we’d go to if we needed a mystery solved.</p>
<p>As for the costumes, period pieces tend to make for difficult costuming when it comes to seeking and fitting. We often utilize our own resources, but don't have everything we need for this production. We will have to rent, which can be very pricey!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>September 12th, 13th and 14th, at the Society Hill Playhouse, <em>Kathy's Daughter</em> will make its debut in the Philadelphia Fringe Festival. <em>Kathy's Daughter</em>, a stage play loosely based on the lives of Catherine Patterson and Katrina Deaton, also known as K.J., delves into the life of character Christina Leeds. Unable to deal with the baggage of her past, Christina wittingly shares her experiences with the audience as she inches closer to her final decision to take her life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Creating awareness through art, writer, director, producer, Katrina Deaton, will use <em>Kathy's Daughter</em> as a platform to launch a non-profit in her mother's name called, ""Cathy's Daughters."" With a redemptive theme, the non-profit will implement programs transforming victims into activists with a heavy focus on domestic violence, physical and sexual abuse, and depression. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Katrina Deaton and her mother Catherine Patterson, who passed away in 97', were both victims of domestic violence and suicide survivors. Katrina's attachment to the production and its purpose, pushed her to partner with organizations in the Phialdelphia area who work directly with populations affected by domestic violence and suicide. Each night of the production, an organization will be highlighted. They will be able to answer questions and offer resources before and after the play. They will also receive a donation from ticket sales that night. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Women in Transition, an organization that offers counseling and advocacy for women endangered by domestic abuse, have already partnered with the production and will be featured Monday night, September 12th. The American Suicide Prevention Association has also expressed interest in partnering with the production. Closing night will focus on Cathy's Daughters the non-profit. ""Everything happens for a reason. To be a victim is not enough, when you can be empowered to use the pain and awareness you receive from a horrible experience to heal or save another.""</p>

<p>This dance film short takes place in Western NY, in an old manor house, situated on a cliff overlooking Lake Erie.  The dancer, Helen French, portrays two characters, or rather two aspects of the same woman.  Indoors, we observe her isolated inside a starkly furnished room.  She is trapped inside the walls, inside her mind, possibly by old memories and habits or society.  She looks out the window and visualizes the freedom and endless possibilities that the outdoors have to offer.  Does she follow her vision of freedom?  Or does she remain confined behind closed doors?  <br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The genre of dance for film, or screendance, is prominent in Europe and gaining exposure here in the USA.  KRD has a long history of collaborating with other artists and mediums, from visual artists to musicians, and the creation of a dance film is the next clear step for us in collaboration. Performance for the stage and the screen are very different mediums. Ms. Reedy is excited to explore the new challenges that choreographing for film has to offer.   She chose to work with Ludovic Jolivet as the Director of Photography for this project due to his experience in dance film, as well as his complimentary aesthetic.  When the project is complete, the film will be shown in concert with KRD as well as submitted to local, national and international  film festivals around the world!</p>

The Impact
The genre of dance for film, or screendance, is prominent in Europe and gaining exposure here in the USA.  KRD has a long history of collaborating with other artists and mediums, from visual artists to musicians, and the creation of a dance film is the next clear step for us in collaboration. Performance for the stage and the screen are very different mediums. Ms. Reedy is excited to explore the new challenges that choreographing for film has to offer.   She chose to work with Ludovic Jolivet as the Director of Photography for this project due to his experience in dance film, as well as his complimentary aesthetic.  When the project is complete, the film will be shown in concert with KRD as well as submitted to local, national and international  film festivals around the world!

A Comedy by Dave Hanson
Hansburg Productions and our friends at The Collective NY are thrilled to present the world premiere of WAITING FOR WAITING FOR GODOT at the 17th Annual New York International Fringe Festival (FringeNYC) this August. 
In WAITING FOR WAITING FOR GODOT, two understudies stuck in backstage limbo grapple with art, life, the “biz,” and their absurd existence.  

Broadway’s Chris Sullivan (Nice Work If You Can Get It, Chicago The Musical, Lombardi), Dave Hanson (Chelsea Lately, Off-Broadway’s The Boss), and Amy Weaver (NBC’s The Office, Riverdance) star in this sharp new comedy written by Dave Hanson and helmed by renowned director Alex Harvey (Balm in Gilead, O Lovely Glowworm).

This means we have less than $800 to go to reach our goal, as of 1pm on our last day!! Can you help us get there??“Look closely at the present you are constructing: it should look like the future you are dreaming.” Alice Walker WHAT IS THE SHAKESPEARE FORUM? The Shakespeare Forum is a home for students, actors, directors and lovers of Shakespeare to play, share, develop, and flourish. The Shakespeare Forum believes in reaching out and building community through education, outreach and performance with an emphasis on providing low-cost, high-quality classes, workshops and productions. The Shakespeare Forum is dedicated to providing services to all members of our New York community and we believe that financial constraints should not prohibit members from gaining the tools and confidence to make their way in New York, both as conscious artists and as parts of a greater artistic alliance.THE PAST- WHAT WE CONSTRUCTED:5 years ago, we didn't have a dream. We simply had an idea, a small downtown loft space and a handful of brave NYC actors who dared to climb the endless stairs in a dingy building to reach an unknown destination labeled ""The Shakespeare Forum"". Over the past 5 years we have, with the incredible support of The Shakespeare Forum community, developed into a company which has:Offered 400+ free/ donation-based workshops hours to actors and artists in NYCDonated 100+ free workshops hours to Public Schools in NYCDeveloped 3 semester-long school residencies in Queens and East Harlem (The Merete Baird and Carolyn and Stanley Bauer Scholarship Funds)Produced 4 Equity Showcase productions, offered at a low cost to the audienceDetermined that cost should never be a barrier to education and therefore created a scholarship program for actors/ students who would not otherwise be able to afford to take classesHELP US BUILD THE FUTURE- WHAT WE DREAM:We aim to have our own space as a base for educational work and productions.We aim to provide 5-10 free school residencies annually.We aim to annually produce 2 high-quality productions at a continued low cost to NYC audiences.We aim to work with more D75 schools and students with special needs by developing a focused and sustainable curriculum to serve both teachers and students in those schools.We aim to provide a variety of high quality free/ donation-based workshops and events to the NYC community.We aim to have an actual office to work in.We aim to have at least 3 part-time, salaried staff members.We aim to have 6-10 teachers on staff....and we aim to have office supplies..... HOW YOU CAN HELP:
We need to compensate our incredible teachers, teaching artists, administrative staff and The Shakespeare Forum Outreach Division.
We need money for production costs and actor stipends.
We need money to invite world-class actors, artists and specialists on relevant topics to speak to our community at no cost to the audience.

How far that little candle throws its beams! So shines a good deed in a naughty world. - Merchant of Venice



 Friend,

 Whether you come by chance, by curiosity, by way of a gentle prod or kick in the pants, welcome.  We are glad you made it.  Perhaps you are a lover of classical theatre. Perhaps you believe in the great heights to which your friends/relatives/countrymen can climb. Perhaps you come with an unquenchable desire to support good people doing good work. Regardless of your inspiration, we raise our glasses to you.  This is an exciting moment for Hedgepig Ensemble Theatre. It’s the beginning of a wild ride, and we wouldn’t want you to miss out.  We are counting on you to be our family, our muses, and torchbearers. Take some time to read about our project, watch our video, and click on that donate button. Even the smallest donation counts in a major way. Our most sincere thanks,Gwen, Mary/Molly, and Adam  co-founders  Hedgepig Ensemble Theatre 







O! For a Muse of Fire that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention. - Henry V



 WHO WE ARE:
 A group of good people who want to do good work.
 WHAT WE BELIEVE:
 Theatre should be based in trust and joy. The way to achieve that kind of theatre is by building a strong ensemble.

WHAT IS A HEDGEPIG, ANYWAY? 
 A hedgepig is a young hedgehog. A term coined by Shakespeare, hedgepigs are unique creatures that deliver the unexpected. Just like us.

 THE PROJECT:
 Our first project is a staged reading of Twelfth Night in April. We will gather our ensemble members, potential ensemble members, a trusted artistic mentor, and a director to lay the foundation for our ensemble. Not only will we take our first step together as a company, we will begin a journey toward a full production of Twelfth Night in the summer.  Why Twelfth Night, you ask. Twelfth Night is the perfect ensemble building play. It allows for a small cast where everyone has an equal role in the story.

 WHERE IS YOUR MONEY GOING EXACTLY?
 We are aiming to raise $4,501.52.  The first $250 will go to a performance venue. The next $400 will go to rehearsal space. The $200 will go toward our amazing director. The following $200 will compensate our fabulous stage manager. The next $1200 will compensate our fine actors. The next $800 will go toward an amazing and trusted movement coach. The final $996.52 will go toward all the administrative expenses: membership to fractured atlas, various fees, letterhead, stamps, the like :) It's not as exciting, but just as necessary.",1.0,0,"4 Campaigns

BQAC (yup... B-quack!) was founded to address the need for visibility, resources and community building for Chicago-area bisexuals.

We want BQAC to attend and host more events, to directly help more people, to create the educational resources desperately needed in healthcare, legal aid, and housing that are bi-specific. To do that we need to become a 501c3 non-profit organization, and start doing the real work as the only organization in Chicago focused on the needs of the bisexual community.<p></p> <p></p>

<p>We (Deanna Palazzo and Tanya Sand) have joined as a team to produce Daniel MacIvor's award winning play, <i>Marion Bridge</i>. We're local actors in Toronto and wanted to delve into and bring to the stage a subject matter and story that meant something unique to each of us, as well as challenge us as artists. Upon researching we discovered our mutual love for Daniel MacIvor's play. It's the story of three young women who come ""home"" to Cape Breton to tend to their dying mother. It's quick,  funny, and touching, exploring not only death, but what memories mean and what expectations we put on life itself. </p>
<p><b>""In some ways, this moving drama, which tiptoes toward sentimentality without ever reaching it, is the most surprising play that [MacIvor's] ever written."" ... ""They have all come home to see their dying mother, but while Mr. MacIvor often writes about death, this resolutely hopeful play is as much about making the most of life (despite all its flaws and disappointments)."" </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i><b>- New York Times</b></i></p>
<p>We are producing this play independently, so we would like to respectively ask for your assistance. Please note that all contributions given to this campaign will be put directly toward production costs entirely (theatre rental, play rights, printing costs, honorariums for the creative team, etc.). You've heard it before, but no contribution is too small and adds up! So please donate if you can!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Let's Break It Down</h3> <p>Our goal is $3500, which covers our production costs ONLY. We do not plan to pay ourselves from this campaign - we hope only to do right by our creative team and be able to compensate them and break even ourselves if at all possible. The fruition and success of this project itself is payment enough for us :)</p>
<p>As a breakdown, all contributions will go towards the following:</p> <ul>
<li>Theatre Rental for a 6 show run.</li> <li>The rights to the play for a 6 show run.</li> <li>Honorariums for our creative team (actor, director, lighting designer, stage manager, graphic designer, publicist, etc.)</li>

<p><strong>My Bio: </strong>At the age of 13 (11 years ago) I began training circus arts in a community circus know as The Great Y Circus in Redlands, Ca. My mother always encouraged us to do what we loved. Since then I have forever been a performing artist and found my love for arts flourished from there. I grew up building houses with my father learning the ways of creation and going off into the forest regularly to learn about herbal medicine and how to survive with mother nature. These seeds that were planted at such a young age have grown into who I am now.<br/><br/>Through college I built and designed sets for the theatre and continued training and performing my circus arts. Two days before my 20th birthday on a warm and sunny day in August I was breathing fire and felt that I had inhaled fumes and possibly had chemical pneumonia. The trip to the ER revealed a tumor in my chest and that the condition was worse... Nine days later I was diagnosed with stage 2 Hodgkins Lymphoma (blood cancer). Forever I was changed, turning away from western medicine I treated myself using herbal medicine, meditation, chi gong, colon hydrotherapy and other modalities over the past 4 years. In this process of healing myself I became a true healer. I flowered into a Holistic Health Practitioner, Herbologist, and shifted my building into the realm of visionary art. Crystals are a large part of my healing and they play a vital role in my work with others. I feel eternally grateful and blessed to have come on this healing journey!<br/><br/>Eventually I burst out of living in the city and moved to Boulder Gardens, a beautiful healing sanctuary in Pioneer Town, Ca where I built my first magical earthen home! The creation of this home sparked a huge transformation inside that led me to follow the call to build here in Portland at Onedoorland!

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Who</span></h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Amanda Miller! I’m presenting my solo comedy How To Suffer Better at this year’s <strong><a href=""https://www.edfringe.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Edinburgh Fringe Festival</a></strong>, and I would deeply appreciate your support. </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/219780956?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>For the past nine years I have been performing my solo shows in venues and festivals across New York City and the United States, shows that include <i>One Breath, Then Another: An Interactive Yoga Show</i> about my life changing journey to an ashram in India to study yoga to avoid the self destructive path of my father, which inspired me to move and empower others through interactive solo performance work—in <i>One Breath, Then Another</i>, I invite the audience to chant, move, and meditate as if they are ashram participants, and to reflect on their own journeys.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497543961/sld0wesgjmwt6da04n9f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My follow up show <i>Camp Smile Power: Curing Anger One Smile at a Time </i>explores the anger of a male teen activist who is sent to an anger management camp on a plea deal after committing a protest action, a camp that forces campers to smile all the time. While attempting to complete a presentation about what he’s learned about managing anger, he cracks, encouraging audience members to yell alongside him the things about society that make them angry and, once they’ve gotten it out of their systems, to hug each other, then draw their feelings and march with them. </p>

<p>In addition to being a writer and performer, I am a massage therapist, yoga instructor, and teaching artist, all practices that I view as having the same ultimate goals: to facilitate human connection and reduce suffering, goals to which I have dedicated my life. I'm especially passionate about using comedy to explore the human condition, believing that collectively laughing at the absurdity of our experiences can help us both lighten our loads and build community.</p>
<p>I have performed in fringe festivals, comedy fests, theaters, bars, synagogues, classrooms, apartments, a massage school, a yoga studio and on rooftops.

Every generous donation helps me get closer to these goals, no matter how big or small.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Performing a show at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival is notoriously risky and comes with multiple challenges. The<strong> biggest risk </strong>is the accruement of personal financial debt<strong>.</strong> The <strong>biggest challenge </strong>is getting people to come and see the show when there are over 3000 shows to see, which is why I’ve chosen to hire a publicist, my largest expense. Even with her expert assistance, I plan to be out on the Royal Mile and near my venue every day as one of my show’s characters, engaging with people about the ways in which they suffer and what it means to suffer better in an effort to get them interested and excited about the show.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Deep in the bowels of the New York City subway system is a mysterious stop called Park Place, where no one enters and no one leaves. An homage to 80s horror films, Park Place takes us on a trip... what may be the worst commute of your life.</p>
<p><i>Park Place<i> </i></i>is the first play by Lindsay Hope Simon to be professionally produced, directed by Lizz Hudman. While the festival provides the venue, publicity, and tech (no small contribution), it takes far more than that to make a show! We believe in paying all creatives for their work. Your contribution will support an all-female creative team and also pay actors, in addition to funding the use of professional production resources like rehearsal space and a stage manager.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The festival provides the space, insurance, and helps promote us. That's a big deal! <strong>However, we don't get any of the proceeds from ticket sales.</strong> Your funds will help pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal space</li>
<li>Actor stipends</li>
<li>Costumes &amp; props</li>
<li>Director &amp; stage manager stipends</li>
<li>Graphic designer for promotional materials</li>
</ul>
<p>The result will be a positive process for all involved, leading to a stage production at The Secret Theatre this July, where we will compete to make it to the finals. The final competition night presents the opportunity to be published in the festival anthology, as well as win cash prizes for best play, best director, and best actor and actress.</p>
<p>Performances are:</p>
<p>July 13 9pm</p>
<p>July 19 7pm</p>
<p>July 22 7:30pm</p>
<p>July 28 5:30pm</p>
<p>August 1 7pm</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This show could be done for free if we rehearsed outdoors and didn't pay anyone, but we value the work of everyone involved in this project and want to create a professional process and product. We value our team and their work and want to pay them for their time and talent.

<p><u><strong>Hurricane House the Musical</strong></u></p>
<p>The video above is an abstract interpretation of Hurricane House the Musical and it was created to showcase one of the original compositions from the show.</p>
<p>This is not a very complicated campaign. It is designed to give you the information you need about the show and why we would need and appreciate your contribution. One of the things we did not want to do is belabor this process, because, frankly, none of us reads as much as we should. Lol, I don't. With that said, on this page you will find a synopsis of the show, original music, what we need the money for and the creative team bios.</p>
<p><u><strong>Hurricane House the Musical Synopsis</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Delta Mason, 22, leaves home one steamy summer night in her North Carolina town for some ice cream and does not return. The frantic family (mother Caroleena, father Bruin, brother Leavell and identical twin Delia) searches for her, a search complicated by the appearance of a hurricane bearing her name. Hurricane Delta is so massive that the townspeople must evacuate. But the Masons believe they have a compelling reason to remain. Only the athiest Leavell seems to understand that they will all be killed. But does the rest of the family know something about God and the spirit that Leavell must re-learn? Will his lack of belief kill them all, or will it save them?</strong></p>
<p>We need $7500 to complete the second draft of our musical. If we can raise this amount, it will push us one step closer to mounting a workshop production in New York City. Workshop productions are a necessity to attract producers who will invest in our full Off-Broadway production. Although we managed to create the first draft via Skype, it is imperative that we all meet in person, in a room with a piano, the script, and the creative energy of New York City.  That's right, we have never met in person and that is a testament to the power of technology. But, this is the point in our process when we have to create face to face.</p>
<p>Here is what your monies will be used for:</p>
<p><strong>**offset the legal costs of the option and collaboration agreements between the creative   team</strong></p>
<p><strong>**accommodations and flight for the lyricist who lives in Italy</strong></p>
<p><strong>**Rehearsal space in NYC for a week of intensive work on the second draft of the show</strong></p>
<p><strong>**fee to have second draft evaluated by the Producer's Perspective before we mount the workshop production</strong></p>
<p><strong>**any other incidentals pertaining to the production of Hurricane House the Musical(per diem, copies, supplies, fees etc.)</strong></p>
<p>In closing, we want to stress that theatre is a collaborative effort. That collaboration is not only between the creatives; it extends to those who can recognize the vision and decide they would like to help that vision come to life. Without you, what we love to do would not be possible. <strong>You have our sincere THANK YOU!! </strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have chosen not to offer any perks because we would have to ask for additional money to pay for them. What we will offer is recognition at every level of our production and updates on the various stages of the show.</p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Kaleid Theatre (as in kaleidoscope, as in collide) is creating a new piece about hate and love and grief. Scape-ing is an exploration of hate in space and in the body, as well as a ritual of compassion. We need your help to reach the last 12% of our goal and bring this work to audiences in Philadelphia.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Description of the Piece:</h3>
<p>We see hate all around. Hatred of seasons, colors, bodies, foods, accents, siblings, religions – everything in between and beyond. We watch as our neighbors eject lyrics, partnerships, strangers, dance moves, and children from their lives, communities, and country. We carry it too – in our veins and breath and fears and dismay. We find ourselves the recipients of hate one moment and then enacting it on others in our turn.</p>
<p><i>Scape-ing</i> is an exploration of hate in space and in the body. Told through dance, poetry, and news articles, <i>Scape-ing</i> is a theatrical investigation of violent human emotions, a personal reflection on the first months of a new administration, and a ritual of compassion.</p>
<p><i>Scape-ing </i>will be presented in partnership with The Drama Group in Germantown on April 27-29.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Kaleid Theatre (as in kaleidoscope, as in collide) is creating a new piece about hate and love and grief. Scape-ing is an exploration of hate in space and in the body, as well as a ritual of compassion. We need your help to reach the last 12% of our goal and bring this work to audiences in Philadelphia.
 
Description of the Piece:
We see hate all around. Hatred of seasons, colors, bodies, foods, accents, siblings, religions – everything in between and beyond. We watch as our neighbors eject lyrics, partnerships, strangers, dance moves, and children from their lives, communities, and country. We carry it too – in our veins and breath and fears and dismay. We find ourselves the recipients of hate one moment and then enacting it on others in our turn.
Scape-ing is an exploration of hate in space and in the body. Told through dance, poetry, and news articles, Scape-ing is a theatrical investigation of violent human emotions, a personal reflection on the first months of a new administration, and a ritual of compassion.
Scape-ing will be presented in partnership with The Drama Group in Germantown on April 27-29.

<p>The saddest part of reality is that we cannot reach all such communities. But we can make a difference, even f for a short while, at two of them.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>The Project</i></strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The project is a <strong>solo experimental dance piece.</strong> The dancer begins in an all white space with lighting done so that there are little to no shadows. As the music starts, she begins to dance. Suddenly, powdered paint starts to get thrown at her but she pays no attention to it. As the music escalates, the backdrop drops to reveal a logo, colored by the paint that was thrown at the dancer all this time. This whole time, we were coloring in the logo while people were focusing on the dancer. By shifting a colorless world to a world full of colors through dance and music, we aim at promoting the creative side of the company and to thus reinforce its mission by inspiring creativity in others.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>The Vision</strong></i></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<p>Growing up, <strong>I was raised in the world of ballet</strong>. Through shows and taking classes for several years, I have experienced both being in the audience and being on the stage. <strong>Even though I no longer dance, I haven't forgotten about it and all my ideas seem to shape around it</strong>.</p>
<p>I came up with this idea randomly about 4 or 5 years ago and somehow it has never left my mind. I finally have a chance to bring it to life and I think it is a comforting way to close off my time at New York University. I think that ballet is incredible and unfortunately hasn't really been in the spotlight for those who don't partake in the dance world so I want to bring it back by - literally - clashing it with art.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I seek to inspire creativity in others through dance. <strong>I want to show how art brings color into one's world, just like ballet brought color into mine as a child. </strong></p>
<p>I think this is a bold idea and I have a great and talented crew to help me out with it so I am extremely excited to see how it all comes together!</p>

Hello Everyone, My name is Lori and I'm a hooper! What's a hooper? A good definition would be: a professional hula hooper or a person with extraordinary and original hula hooping skills. (Thanks Urban dictionary!) Being a hooper is my passion and my dream is to spread hoop love, through dance and fitness to people of all ages.  I currently work in the food and beverage industry, like a lot of performers and artists, but I dream of being recognized for my talent and being able to have a career doing what I love.  I am a trained educator, as well as a coach and a holistic wellness advocate.  I have been hooping for close to 3 years and it has changed my life.  I want to be able to help others do the same.  I have lost 35+ pounds since picking up a hoop.  I have created a design for my own brand of hoops and have begun working in my community to help spread the love of hooping, fitness and dance, to people of all ages.

 
MY CAMPAIGN
In my campaign, I hope to raise funds so that I can produce my brand of hoops and make them available to as many people as possible. With the funds raised I can purchase supplies for production, promotions and education. This is my dream but without the support of others, starting my own business would be next to impossible.  Given the opportunity, I know I can really make a name for myself and be successful in this endeavor.  My passion is contagious and my idea well thought out.  I truly believe that if you do what you love you will be successful.
 
Your contribution to my campaign will allow me to:


Purchase all necessary supplies, including but not limited to tubing, tape, connectors, and other design materials. 
Obtain Business licenses and insurance.
Assist in the purchase of promotional materials for vending and teaching.
Education opportunities for myself and my students.  Fitness Certification, studio rental, and development of educational materials for students and myself.

Without assistance, it would take me years to do all these things on my own.  I have been supported in my dream thus far, so I know the support exists and through this fund I can make it a reality.
 
MY GOAL

My goal is to raise $3500. I came to this amount by building my business plan and breaking down my needs into manageable pieces.  I have an order, based on necessity, that would make my business legitmate and able to flourish.


Supplies to develop my brand of hoops ($500).  
Patent and/or trademark my specialty hoop.($300-500) 
Business license and insurance.($1000)
Signs and cards to promote my hoops($300).
Fitness certification so that I may teach in gyms, schools, and fitness studios.($1000).

If I receive funds through this campaign I will begin making hoops immediately.  That would be the jump start to get the business up and running.  I would then make everything legitimate and get my licenses and insurance. Education and Promotion would be my last investments. If I'm able to go beyond the $3500, it would be directly invested in Glitterhoopz, for more supplies, equipment (power tools, sewing machine), studio space, and continuing education.  I have the ability and drive to make this a complete and fully operation business, with hoops for sale and all licenses and certifications by July 2013 with the proper funding. This is my first dream that I can honestly say I am seeing through to its fullest.  I have been successful in my career and the activities I've participated in over my years, but this is something that encompasses my dreams, aspirations, my personality and my desire to teach and perform all into one.  


THE PERKS

The Perks for funding Glitterhoopz by Lori are pretty special.  

Anyone who contributes $25 will receive an intro to hoop dance video, created especially for this campaign. 
For contributions of $100 or more, I will be creating a custom hoop and tutorial based on your specifications (ie: weighted fitness hoop, dance hoop or youth hoop).

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>We’re Hartshorn – Hook Productions and we’re trying to raise £7000 to take Jon Brittain’s wonderful play<i> Rotterdam </i>to Brits Off Broadway this year in New York City.</p>
<p>‘No Alice, I don’t want to <i>become </i>a man, I just want to stop trying to be a woman.’</p>
<p><i>Rotterdam </i>is the story of Alice and Fiona, a young couple who live in the Netherlands. It starts on the night when Alice has finally plucked up the courage to email her parents and tell them she's gay. But before she can hit send, Fiona reveals that <i>he</i> has always identified as male and wants to start living as one - named Adrian. Now, as Adrian begins his transition, Alice must ask a question she never thought she’d ask… Does this mean she’s straight?</p>
<p><i>Rotterdam</i> is a modern story about gender, sexuality and being a long way from home. It shines a light on a kind of relationship that’s underrepresented on stage, and does so with honesty, humour and compassion.</p>
<p>We first read the play in 2015 when Donnacadh O’Briain approached us to produce it and we both immediately fell in love with it. We signed on to mount a production of the show at Theatre503, assembling an amazing production team and an absolutely stellar cast. They took the script we loved and created a beautiful production: we were delighted to have that rare experience when everyone involved in a show really loved it.</p>
<p>Since the very first performance, audiences and critics alike have embraced the show. Time Out said <i>‘Brittain’s play is another reminder – warm, witty and wise – of the stupidity of thinking that there are only two genders’</i> the Evening Standard called it <i>‘A hard hitting piece about love, gender and sexuality’</i> and The Stage said <i>‘Jon Brittain’s warm-hearted new play manages to speak eloquently about a complex issue while at the same time being properly laugh-out-loud funny’.</i></p>
<p>It sold out its run and transferred to the Trafalgar Studios in the West End, following which Jon was nominated for the Charles Wintour Award for Most Promising Playwright at the <i>Evening Standard </i>awards.</p>
<p>We applied for Brits Off Broadway, an annual theatre festival that showcases work from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""United Kingdom"">United Kingdom</a>, described by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Isherwood"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Charles Isherwood"">Charles Isherwood</a> of the New York Times as '<i>a highlight of the theatrical year'</i> in New York, and are delighted to have been accepted.</p>
<p>It’s a fantastic opportunity for everyone: for us, it’s a chance to take work we’re proud of to the theatre capital of the world, for our actors and creatives it’s an opportunity to make connections in the industry there. But most importantly, it’s a platform to share this story with more people.</p>
<p>However, mounting a production off-Broadway is expensive. Our budget is £50,000, we’re not eligible for public subsidy and due to the size of the venue we’re guaranteed to make a loss.</p>
<p>This is why we need your help to raise 14% of what we need to share Rotterdam with the people of New York.</p>
<p>This money will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>£13,000 for the cast and creatives fees</li>
<li>£14000 for production and theatre fees</li>
<li>£6000 for accommodation for our cast</li>
<li>£5000 flights</li>
<li>£15000 we’ll need for general costs like visa’s, administration, marketing and extra travel. </li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, we have a lot of money to raise, any help you are able to give is extremely valuable to us, and as a way of saying thank you we have some exciting perks to offer. Have a look to the right hand side!</p>
<p>For us, sharing this play with a New York audience is incredibly important. It speaks about relationships in a new and exciting way, it gets to the heart of what love is, what makes us love each other and what values we put on that love. Now, more than ever, we need stories like Rotterdam.</p>

<h3><strong>About the Show</strong></h3>
<p>Follow struggling actor (VINNY) over the course of 3 weeks, as he tries to come to terms with his demons upon discovering he is about to become a father.</p>
<p>Highlighting the battle that rages inside one’s head at all times, but especially during moments of crisis in one’s life.</p>
<p>A Fear and Loathing Actor in Dublin is a dark, humorous and gritty play examining the great debate of art versus commerce, and the sacrifice artists face on a daily basis, in just trying to survive, and to live a ‘normal life’. Can we follow our creative urges and still have a life, or is it always to be a struggle? And is that struggle even worth it?</p>

<p>AVANTHARDCOLLECTIVE invite you to join them in the party at the end of the world. The rogue planet Nibiru, as predicted by internet conspiracy theorists, crashes into earth, and NIBIRU! presents society collapsing into the black-hole and having a wail of a time as it does so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are many ways to join the party. On August 6th you can join us in building a giant capitalism mother-monster. On August 7th you could be part of the cast if you like – drop us a line – and, of course, you can come and see it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>BUT, times are hard for sailors, and AVANTHARDCOLLECTIVE needs your help to make this show happen. We are looking to make £1000 to cover rehearsal space, marketing, set materials, art supplies, transport costs for our wonderful performers, and costumes. £1000 covers the bare minimum needed to get this show on in the way we want to, but we are more than happy to exceed the goal and for once stop being artists who always have to cut a million corners because they don't have a trust fund. That is to say, past productions like “The Third Policeman” and “Gargantua” were done on budgets of about £500 – wouldn't you be curious to see what we could do if we had £10,000? YES. Yes you would.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ABOUT THE ARTISTS</p>
<p>Ergo Phizmiz (PLC) has been making DIY music-multimedia-theatre for over 10 years across the UK and Europe, and experimental music, including nearly 1000 tracks of free, Creative Commons music, over the past 20 years. Despite sell-out tours and critical acclaim, they have never once successfully received UK arts funding to put on an independent production, and instead has relied on hustling and regular bouts of poverty to bring the magic to life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lottie (Depresstival) Bowater is the curator of London's longest running Avant-Hard night Depresstival Presents, which has provided a platform for experimental work from artists across film, performance-art, music and the left-field of comedy since 2011 and, again, runs at a perpetual loss.</p>

<p>Everyone from flat-earthers to Slavoj Zizek is telling us that the end of the world is nigh, and one side of the spectrum or the other must be right. So why not celebrate the apocalypse with NIBIRU! the new techno-opera by “maverick composer” Ergo Phizmiz (PLC).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hot on the heels of Mahogany Opera Group's sell-out tour of the electronic time-travel epic “Mozart vs Machine” and the controversial community-theatre apocalypse “The United Kingdom of Earth: A Brexit Opera”, Ergo Phizmiz (PLC) makes a return to Tête à Tête: The Opera Festival with this heavy slice of DIY agitprop collage theatre that continues in the quest to redefine opera completely in the 21st century.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The definition is this: 21st century opera is any kind of entertainment that uses performers, sound, image, and the cross-pollination of techniques and technologies to create analogue-digital / virtual-space-meat-space Gesamtkunstwerk. The future of opera has nothing to do with tiaras, bow-ties, and the operatic voice, and everything to do with the late 19th – early 20th century search by avant-gardists of “the total work of art” and the possibilities of this in the digital age. Fundamentally all you need to make an opera is a laptop and some willing friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And willing friends there are. In common with last year's presentations of “The United Kingdom of Earth” in London, Glasgow and Rotterdam, AVANTHARDCOLLECTIVE have gathered together a bevy of beautiful professional and non-professional performers to bring the end of the world to life. Watch as all your friends become estate agents, divinities, mythological figures, terrible children, social-network Gods, and secret-police. Society is collapsing and a giant, happy, tap-dancing celestial ball rapidly approaching earth has something to do with it. We really ought to have a party.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ergo Phizmiz (PLC) / Dominic Robertson has been presenting music-theatre, opera and multimedia works, always somewhere under-the-radar, across the UK and Europe for a long time. Their productions have included “Gargantua”, “The Third Policeman”, “The Mourning Show”, “Gala”, “UOEIA: The Histories of Yodelling”, “The United Kingdom of Earth”, “Fulcanelli's Shoes”, and “Mozart vs Machine”. They are regarded by fools and wise men alike as a leading light and rabid experimentalist in the world of contemporary opera.</p>

HADES and PERSEPHONE
Hades and Persephone is an original ballet film based on the Ancient Myth. 
The film will serve as the starting point for an original LIVE production mixing BALLET and FILM. The film will be used as a calling card for future production investment, but will also work as a standalone piece. Our previous Co-Production RAPUNZEL with Sisters Grimm and The Royal Ballet serves as an example of what can be accomplished on a low budget. 
Hades will be created using motion capture technology, to capture the movements of the Male Lead and CGI, the same process used for the creation of Gollum in lord of the rings. although he won't look like Gollum as that would be too weird.
**This will be the first ballet ever committed to film with a CGI dance partner!**
The Film will be shot in 3D using the brand new Red Epic rig.

Despite all of these impressive whizzbang effects, everyone is working on this movie for the love of it, without your donations we will not be able to shoot at all. 
This really is the chance to become involved in a first for dance and film. Donations start from as low as $5/ï¿½3 and can be made by credit card or paypal. If you can't donate please retweet, share, e-mail or Facebook this page as far and wide as possible. 
Thank you in Advance.

Hades and Persephone will be shot entirely on location 
(apart from the scenes in Hades of course).

THE STORY of HADES AND PERSEPHONE
The short will highlight key plot points in the persephone myth, but also serve as a standalone story.

A young Ballerina, practices alone in her studio, Lost in the music she dances into her imagination and through the changing seasons, Confronted by a stranger, she pursues him to find herself at the gateway of hell (hades), caught by the souls of the dead, she is slowly drawn below ground, she awakens to find herself back in the studio, , the glass starts to melt and hades appears aflame, they dance with passion as she transforms into the queen of the underworld, with a flash of flame Hades is gone as is any evidence of him being there. The Ballerina looks at her reflection and leaves, her reflection smiles knowingly and leaves one step behind her.

<h3>We want to make Unknown Artists known.</h3>
<p>Play Club was started two years ago and we’ve already come so far! We have active clubs in Los Angeles and New York with over 350 people, collectively, on our email lists.  The club gives actors, directors and writers in New York and Los Angeles the opportunity to... play.</p>
<p><strong>THE UNKNOWN ARTISTS</strong> -  The Unknown Artists mission is to provide opportunities for talented, unknown individuals to thrive on a stage enabling them to show off their gifts of music, acting, dance, comedy, film and all categories of art. Founded in 2007 by Pamela Eberhardt and Emily Clark, the Unknown Artists search far and wide for an explosive amount of talent that is of a specific, unheard of, untraveled artistry.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We DO</h3>
<p>Play Club of the Unknown Artists has been focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Table Readings</li>
<li>STaged Readings</li>
<li>Scene Workshops</li>
<li>Full productions</li>
<li>Musical Sing Alongs</li>
<li>Original work workshops</li>
<li>sketch comedy and improv</li>
<li>And MUCH MUCH more…</li>
</ul>
<p>But these things cost money. We have BIG plans to produce more STaged readings of original and published work along with full productions of new material. Spaces cost money. It can cost up to $2500 to rent a space for a week! Our money would go to help ease the cost of these spaces and other necessities of producing theatre. When we produce our Scene Nights (Which can cost up to $250 each time we do it) we video tape our actors in their scenes. This helps them with their REELS and gives them footage for their websites and certain audition submissions. With better camera equipment we can give them quality footage to use for these important tools in their career. </p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal of $4500, any money we DO make will still go into the club, but we will then trim down the GOAL list for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>If we go OVER our goal of $4,500, any additional money we make will be split between us and Play Club West!</p>
<h3>Why You Should Donate</h3>
<p>Acting classes and several theatre clubs in New York cost money to be a part of and there are so many talented people out there who don’t get the opportunity to participate in artistic activities due to time or finances. Play Club gives so many creative people the chance to do what they love to do with out having to commit to a strenuous schedule and with out having to pay a membership due.</p>
</div>

<h3>What People in Play Club are Saying:</h3>
<p>""ACTOR FRIENDS! If you want to be in an acting class, but don't have the money. Or if you want to be in a play, but can't commit to a full rehearsal schedule, then you need to come join PLAY CLUB! Staged readings of new and established works every week! It's a lot of fun and it's an excuse to work on a piece for some time. If summer has been slow for you, then THIS IS WHAT'S UP! COME ON OUT AND JOIN!!!” - Carson Higgins (Play Club West member)</p>
<p>""I want to thank you for a good night. It was lovely to meet everybody, watch everyone work and to work on my cold reading technique in a casual atmosphere. I learned a lot and enjoyed myself doing so. I look forward to attending and reading at the Play Club readings in the future. Have a great night.” - Jessica Levesque (Play Club East member)</p>

<p>Dancers will perform short choreographed dance sequences in site-specific locations inside/outside the cathedral.

Project description:

Can light be danced, can shadow?

Light is expansive and there are various approaches to investigating this phenomenon.
For instance, light can be connected to temperature, and color may elicit emotion. For
Running Candles I have used the image of candlelight as home base for specificity.

The illumination a candle creates reminds one of paintings by Rembrandt or Caravaggio,
of the chiaroscuro effect. It illuminates only so much of an area, creating mystery and
some shadow. I love that play of light. In addition, the flame is not static it flickers,
sways, threatens to consume itself... and once the flame is blown off, smoke figures
emerge, moving.

These were some of the shapes and actions explored in creating the movements for the
dance.

Why film at the Cathedral of Learning?

The various ways light filters through the glass windows of the cathedral reveals the
beauty of juxtaposing light with shadow. It reveals impressive details of architecture,
design, and invites the senses to imagine stories. To imagine the lives of people of
diverse nationalities and age groups coming together to share spaces.

THE IMPACT
Why this production?
There are endless dance, theatre, performance productions currently trying to emerge. And that is good news for the arts. But, how do you select which one to support? Why this campaign?
xodus dance collective has a history of producing work that is for everyone. Whether you are a dancer, teacher, doctor or waiter, there is something for you. We touch on every day scenarios and frame our narratives in a slice of life window, giving you a glimpse into a moment of time.
TRIGGER takes a look at three historical events and compares individual frustration to collective outrage. Ride the roller coaster of emotions as we move through time experiencing the full circle of life.
We understand that times are tough. We are just recovering from one of the toughest financial disasters this century and as always the arts takes a hit stronger and longer than other areas.

<p><b>Seminar</b> by Theresa Rebeck is the FIRST production by Vancouver's brand-new 'Stages Theatre Co.'</p>
<p><b>Who is Stages Theatre Co.?</b> Stages Theatre Co. consists of three emerging artists, colleagues, and friends, each with a vision: Stages Theatre Co. is committed to creating rare opportunities for artists with passion and integrity, working towards establishment in the theatre community. The company does so by presenting thought-provoking, ballsy, and often humorous works that we consider to be relevant, engaging, and, quite simply, a good f***ing time. </p>
<p><b>What are we doing with this project? </b></p>
<p>Vancouver has a vast arts community and theatre is at the forefront of it. Unfortunately, like many other artists, we are constantly searching for material that we can sink our teeth into. Even with the wealth of productions in Vancouver, there is a lack of opportunities for artists to nurture their process and to allow their work to thrive. This project is here to change that. We seek to establish a passion driven company, to feature some of the finest talent in Vancouver, and to create a learning experience that culminates in a great production.</p><p><b>What is Seminar?</b></p><p></p><p></p><p>In Seminar, a provocative comedy from Pulitzer Prize nominee, Theresa Rebeck, four aspiring young novelists sign up for private writing classes with Leonard, an international literary figure.

background spans many disciplines, having explored film-making, singing,
acting, dance, directing, and writing. At the age of 14, she wrote and produced
her first short film, <i>The Tenants</i>,
for the North Shore Film Festival, ultimately winning several awards, including
'Best Picture'. She went on to write, produce, and direct two subsequent films,
both of which were also honored at the Festival. Though she has a deep passion
for film, Devon’s true love is musical
theatre. Recent credits include: Kate in <i>Legally

The Impact
The impact is simple: we're creating valuable opportunities for actors, directors and designers in this city. With your donation, you can be apart of this challenge and know that you have had a hand it making quality theatre come to life. We are aware that producing theatre in Vancouver is difficult. This is the simplest, yet largest, challenge that any theatre company has to go up against. There are a few reasons why: saturation, funding, and public appeal. We are more than aware of these factors but are determined to be a solution seeking company and one that works and fights hard.

How will we overcome these risks and potential setbacks?

* Going up against other companies

This is healthy competition to have in any art form. The fact that we are new and don't have a following yet, just lights a fire under our ass. We strongly believe that the material we are choosing to produce separates us from much of the theatre in town.

* Not having enough money

Theatre is expensive. That is the reality. We have worked hard to make this production cost effective, while keeping our artistic integrity and the director's has vision in tact. Even with the generosity of our Indiegogo backers, we are constantly looking for alternative sources of funding to accommodate our tight budget. Unfortunately, there is always the possibility that we will be short, financially speaking.

Whether it be altering designs, playing with new ideas, or working overtime, we are ready to change and progress. Theatre is a living art form and it is absolutely necessary to know how to work with these challenges.

* Being unique, yet appealing to the general public

The biggest artistic challenge of this production. Reviews and criticism aside, we want to get as many people as we can to take a chance on a new company and come enjoy this wonderful play. We're confident in our production and our artistic values. We will be up night and day to prove to our patrons that we are worthy of a spot in the Vancouver theatre scene. Our company is seeking the patronage of a new generation of theatre-goers, while accommodating the current audience demographic present in Vancouver.We are a group of extreme professionals and the three of us share very different histories that complement our method of work.

<h2><b>OUR STORY</b></h2><p><b>ABOUT <i>THE LOVESEAT </i></b></p><p>Scantily Glad Theatre premieres the full-length version of <i>The Loveseat, </i>written and directed by S.E. Grummett at the PotashCorp Fringe Theatre Festival in Saskatoon from July 30th-August 8th. </p><p>Written at the Saskatchewan Playwrights Centre's 24-Hour Playwriting Competition, <i>The Loveseat </i>placed 2nd in the student category. In December 2014, the play was shown at the Drama Students Association One Act Play Festival in the Department of Drama at the University of Saskatchewan. Since its creation, the play has undergone a series of developmental workshops to evolve it into a full length production. </p><p><i>The Loveseat </i>is created entirely by U of S Department of Drama students, S.E. Grummett (writer/director), Kelly McTaggart (actor), Kyle Kurchirka (actor) &amp; Yvonne Addai (stage manager). </p><p><b>ABOUT SCANTILY GLAD THEATRE</b></p><p>Founded in 2014, Scantily Glad Theatre is a Saskatoon-based theatre company. Our goal is to create original work that provokes laughter, emotion and thought. <i>The Loveseat </i>is the first Fringe show for the company. </p><p><b>WHY TELL THIS STORY?</b></p><blockquote>
<p><i>As a child of divorce, </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The Loveseat</span><i> </i>is a very personal work. Much of
the play’s thematic content come from my personal experiences which I would
describe as an amalgamation of my parent’s divorce (quoted directly in the play
as the “Best Divorce Ever”) and my own failed relationships. When I first wrote
the play, I had just gone through a messy break-up. My own feelings of
inadequacy, heartache and frustration are mirrored in the characters. And for
those reasons, <i>The Loveseat</i> was an
amazing form of catharsis (get dumped, write a play!). Staging <i>The
Loveseat </i>equally terrifies and excites me as an artist and I both love and
cringe at bringing it to an audience. Despite what I’m sure is a challenging
road ahead, I am thrilled to be bringing this show to audiences this summer at the Saskatoon Fringe. </p>

OUR STORYABOUT THE LOVESEAT Scantily Glad Theatre premieres the full-length version of The Loveseat, written and directed by S.E. Grummett at the PotashCorp Fringe Theatre Festival in Saskatoon from July 30th-August 8th. Written at the Saskatchewan Playwrights Centre's 24-Hour Playwriting Competition, The Loveseat placed 2nd in the student category. In December 2014, the play was shown at the Drama Students Association One Act Play Festival in the Department of Drama at the University of Saskatchewan. Since its creation, the play has undergone a series of developmental workshops to evolve it into a full length production. The Loveseat is created entirely by U of S Department of Drama students, S.E. Grummett (writer/director), Kelly McTaggart (actor), Kyle Kurchirka (actor) & Yvonne Addai (stage manager). ABOUT SCANTILY GLAD THEATREFounded in 2014, Scantily Glad Theatre is a Saskatoon-based theatre company. Our goal is to create original work that provokes laughter, emotion and thought. The Loveseat is the first Fringe show for the company. WHY TELL THIS STORY?
As a child of divorce, The Loveseat is a very personal work. Much of
the play’s thematic content come from my personal experiences which I would
describe as an amalgamation of my parent’s divorce (quoted directly in the play
as the “Best Divorce Ever”) and my own failed relationships. When I first wrote
the play, I had just gone through a messy break-up. My own feelings of
inadequacy, heartache and frustration are mirrored in the characters. And for
those reasons, The Loveseat was an
amazing form of catharsis (get dumped, write a play!). Staging The
Loveseat equally terrifies and excites me as an artist and I both love and
cringe at bringing it to an audience. Despite what I’m sure is a challenging
road ahead, I am thrilled to be bringing this show to audiences this summer at the Saskatoon Fringe. 
-S.E. Grummett (Writer & Director)

But many new play development centers in Chicago cater toward established writers, leaving emerging artists at a loss for opportunity. This May, Carina Abbaticchio is directing Juli Del Prete's <i>The Art of Losing, </i>a fresh new play brought to life by the newest generation of Chicago theatremakers. This project will be the first in a cycle of readings and world premiere productions showcasing up-and-coming talent in Chicago’s new work community.</p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We're Asking For</h3><div>We are asking for your help and partnership. It is vitally important to us that our actors and designers are both paid for their work and provided with the funds and supplies they need to fully utilize their artistic abilities. For <i>The Art of Losing, </i>we are need to raise $6,250 for renting a performance space at The Den Theatre, production budgets for our design team, marketing for the show, and most importantly, giving our artists payment for their hard work on this project.<p></p>
<p>To date, we have already raised over $3,800 in funding, volunteer work, and in-kind donations and have secured our performance space at The Den. With the help of the internet magic of crowdfunding, we hope to push ourselves up to an operational budget to get through production.  </p>
<p>$10 will give us one of the many buddha statues we need on stage! $15 will give us a pair of intimidating surgical scrubs!  $100 will help compensate a designer or actor for their hard work and commitment to this production. </p>

<p>“For the 86th consecutive autumn, the Red Sox are not going to win the World Series.”</p>
<br/><p>So proclaims the Boston Globe at the height of the 2004 American League Championship Series. Boston’s beloved Red Sox are down three games to none against their rival Yankees, and the curse keeping them from a championship is as strong as ever. To break that curse? It would take a miracle.</p>
<br/>The Red Sox have devoted fans in Brett, Holly, and Dominic - three siblings who are less than lucky themselves. When their father disappears, leaving them in the care of their estranged Aunt Peg, their family might be in more dire need of a miracle than their team. Hoping for a victory on or off the field, Brett prays to every possible deity.Dominic seeks answers in statistics. And as losses pile up, Holly uncovers a clue to their father’s whereabouts. Against impossible odds, is there still a way to win?<p></p>
<p></p>

</div></div>","In ShortChicago theatre has a strong and beautiful history of New Plays and New Work. But many new play development centers in Chicago cater toward established writers, leaving emerging artists at a loss for opportunity. This May, Carina Abbaticchio is directing Juli Del Prete's The Art of Losing, a fresh new play brought to life by the newest generation of Chicago theatremakers. This project will be the first in a cycle of readings and world premiere productions showcasing up-and-coming talent in Chicago’s new work community.What We're Asking ForWe are asking for your help and partnership. It is vitally important to us that our actors and designers are both paid for their work and provided with the funds and supplies they need to fully utilize their artistic abilities. For The Art of Losing, we are need to raise $6,250 for renting a performance space at The Den Theatre, production budgets for our design team, marketing for the show, and most importantly, giving our artists payment for their hard work on this project.
To date, we have already raised over $3,800 in funding, volunteer work, and in-kind donations and have secured our performance space at The Den. With the help of the internet magic of crowdfunding, we hope to push ourselves up to an operational budget to get through production.  
$10 will give us one of the many buddha statues we need on stage! $15 will give us a pair of intimidating surgical scrubs!  $100 will help compensate a designer or actor for their hard work and commitment to this production. 
Here's where are money is going and has gone!
$1,300 - marketing, insurance, auditions
$2,700 - cast/designer payments and budgets
$2,250 - Venue rental and Tech fees.

The Play
“For the 86th consecutive autumn, the Red Sox are not going to win the World Series.”
So proclaims the Boston Globe at the height of the 2004 American League Championship Series. Boston’s beloved Red Sox are down three games to none against their rival Yankees, and the curse keeping them from a championship is as strong as ever. To break that curse? It would take a miracle.
The Red Sox have devoted fans in Brett, Holly, and Dominic - three siblings who are less than lucky themselves. When their father disappears, leaving them in the care of their estranged Aunt Peg, their family might be in more dire need of a miracle than their team. Hoping for a victory on or off the field, Brett prays to every possible deity.Dominic seeks answers in statistics. And as losses pile up, Holly uncovers a clue to their father’s whereabouts. Against impossible odds, is there still a way to win?

Big Picture
This is going to be more than just a singular excellent production. This is going to be a model for our contemporaries. The success of this production will enable the success and development of more productions for years to come. Our producing team is committed to finding new artists and voices and after we've done it successfully once, we'll be able to program more and more opportunities for artists we haven't worked with before, or haven't even met yet.

<h3>The Basics</h3>
We are the <b>Demented Dolls of Sideshow</b>, an international all-female freakshow troupe bringing our bizarre brand of ridiculosity to the universe. We bring together performers from <i>Germany</i>, <i>Norway</i>, <i>France</i>, <i>Israel</i> and the <i>USA</i>, and although we're over the moon about our stellar cast, it's costlier to put together a tour when we bring in ladies from around the world. <br/><br/>
</div><div>The Dolls did a highly successful European tour in the spring of 2015: not only did the audience adore the show, but it was the most (legal) fun we'd had in awhile! We immediately decided to continue pushing the show. As we progress, we are building the name and bringing more people into our weird world: if this American tour does well, we hope to tour Australia and Europe in 2017. Today, the east coast of the USA; tomorrow: THE WORLD! We're here to ask your help to get this show on the road! All contributions go directly to the cost of travel, printing merchandise, and hard-to-find props that have to come from Europe. <br/> </div> <div> <h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/>
</h3> <p>Here's our approximation of what it will cost to get us into and around the States. We're not including the daily costs of food/accommodation, as we hope to stay with friends along the way and eat cheaply on the road (as a general rule, we feed and shelter ourselves with any profits from merchandise).<br/></p> <ul> <li>3 European-USA round trip flights: $2000 <br/>
</li>
<li>Van rental: $1700<br/>
</li>
<li>Gasoline: $800 (estimated, ocourse)</li>

</li> <li>Although this is our first time doing an electronic crowd-funding project, we've always been supported through direct sponsorships by companies, donations from individuals that want to see more of us on the road, and by putting our own money into the show that we love. <br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p> <ul> <li>This is a relatively new show that hasn't established itself in the US (hence us doing this tour!). There's every chance that we'll arrive in a city and the show tanks, with very few tickets sold. What then? Between the 6 Dolls on this tour, we have nearly 100 years of performance experience. However, that doesn't guarantee us an audience. If we don't have an audience, we don't sell any merchandise, and we don't eat that day. (That can light a <i>serious</i> fire under your ass to promote the show!)<br/>
</li> <li>Thankfully, we have friends. We have an immense backing of people around the world that want to see us succeed, and our network of industry professionals will help us spread the word. Yes, touring is HARD work. Yes, we're INSANE for locking 6 girls in a van for a month with<i> lots</i> of sharp objects. But we love what we do, so we are working to heavily promote every new show that confirms on the tour. We'll be pushing for media interviews and appearances in every city, and with the booking wisdom of the amazing <b>Squidling Bros.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Hey, Mahoney family and friends!  Lots of folks have asked us when and how they can help support Gwynn's first step into the Irish dance big leagues, so we set up this Indiegogo page to make it convenient and easy! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>She's come a long way from the little 4 year old we enrolled in Irish dance classes.  Gwynn is now working on her Preliminary Champion dances (the second highest level of competition).  This November she'll take her first trip to Oireachtas - the regional competition where dancers can qualify for the National and World Championships!   She's not old enough for Worlds yet (a couple more years), but her teachers think she has a shot at being in the top 10 at Oireachtas and qualifying for the North American National Championships in Montreal, Quebec next summer. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>To compete at Orieachtas (and beyond) Gwynn needs her first solo dress.  We're getting a DEAL at $1200 (yep, they really cost that and more!) because one of her teachers is a dress maker.  Please don't feel in any way obligated to contribute!  But lots of family and friends have asked to help out, so we thought this would be an easy way to let you know it's time.</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need</p>
<ul>
<li>A beautiful solo dress for Gwynn's first competition with the Scariff Hardiman School in September (Oireachtas in November!). (We'll post the mock up here soon, but rumor has it, the dress might have the Mahoney family crest on the cape.  We think that's pretty awesome.)</li>

A BIT OF the HISTORY of NEW PORT RICHEY
On Jan. 1, 1926, the New
Port Richey Press reported:

FAMOUS MILLIONAIRES OF BROADWAY BUY IN 
NEW PORT RICHEY
Thomas Meighan and Paul Whiteman, Irving Berlin, Sam H. Harris
Among Celebrities Who Have Purchased Here
Celebrities famous the
world over, owners of names as familiar to Paris theatre-goers and Australian
music-lovers as they are to the inhabitants of old Manhattan Isle, have bought
land in New Port Richey, and plan to build winter homes in this famous
resort-town, the New Port Richey Press has learned. Recent purchases of
building lots in this city, when generally known, will thrust New Port Richey
in the public eye as no other community of like size in the limits of Florida
can possibly be subjected to the calcium glare of publicity. 
During the 1920s, New
Port Richey was a gathering place tor film stars and other celebrities. The

SYNOPSIS
When Jamie, Alyssa and Becky attend a hometown wedding, their shared history of relentless bullying is right there waiting for them.
The three women relive their past and explore the three sides of the drama that plagued their junior high school years: the victim, the bully and the girl who stood by.

Years earlier, when Alyssa met Becky, at junior high, her existing friendship with Jamie was put to the test.Things escalate for all three girls when a viral video of Jamie rips through their lives. Jamie knows it must be Becky’s handiwork, but Alyssa doesn’t believe her new friend could be capable of such cruelty.
Things spiral out of control when the bullying takes the form of anonymous, threatening texts and cruel chat-room comments.  Alyssa finally sees how bad things have become, tries to step in, exposing the situation. Is it too little, too late?
All three women are still dealing with their own fallout; no-one walked away unscathed. Alyssa is carrying the guilt from being a passive bystander for so long.

In a play where no one person is entirely innocent, nor completely unsympathetic, FallOut asks the question ‘if it were you, what would you do?’
FallOut is a play for three actors and will tour to junior high schools in Spring 2014.

My name is Bob Linebarger and I am one of the founders of Different Choices Productions. <i>Danny and the Deep Blue Sea </i>by John Patrick Shanley (<i>Doubt</i> being one of his most popular works) is the second show produced by Different Choices, the first being an original work called <i>The Bottom of Everything </i>presented on the Unicorn main stage as a part of the 2011 KC Fringe Festival. Different Choices alludes to works being cultivated with a comedian's touch, or finesse. At the center of the lessons Bruce Woodruff shared with us at Baker University (Bruce was the head of the department when I went there and is now retired) was one word: Choices. Life and theatre, in their simplest form, are just a collection of choices. The choices brought forth by true comedians (I believe true comedians are those who can go through the thought process to find the humor in anything and everything) might not always hold as the best choices, but they can sure be counted on to be different. These different choices made by these true comedians will hope to build on the open-mindset that there is never only one way of doing things.</p> </div> <div> <h3><i>Danny and the Deep Blue Sea </i></h3>
<div>This play, written by young John Patrick Shanley who has one hell of a career after writing this one, is a dark play. Danny is an angry man who gets into multiple bar fights. Roberta... well you will have to come see the show to find out what makes her dark. As dark as it is, though, I would find myself laughing out loud when reading it. I hear two kindergartners talking. They just happen to be 29 and 31. Hence, my concept: this is a love story between two adult-children. Oh, adult-children exist. They absolutely, positively exist. The question was then, ""What cultural world do I put them in to really bring out this concept?"" Then timing gave me a present. I was walking to Crown Center one day when I see a man, maybe early 30s, heading to the ""oh-so-notorious"" annual concert in KC called Rockfest. I watched him notice a pigeon while walking, tell his friends to ""Watch this!"" and then proceed to intimidatingly step to this pigeon. Pigeon flew off, went about his day. But this man and his friends thought it was hilarious. I find it hilarious, however, because I had truly observed adult-children in action. So, Roberta and Danny... yeah they are going to be Rockfest people. Oh, and there will be Nickelback songs in the sound design. You can count on that! With this concept, hopefully this comedian's touch to a now 30-year-old play will bring the rich, dark undertones people have come to love and also make it a fun, hilarious experience for those watching.</div> <p></p>
<h3>Artist Funding for <i style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Danny and the Deep Blue Sea </i>
</h3>
<p>Funding, of course, is crucial towards the production of a show. It can come from multiple resources or it can come from one big donor. Different Choices is still at the very beginning of its business life, so funding is coming from anywhere we can get it. I'm paying for the rehearsal space in painting labor. I'm paying for the performance space in putting on a variety show (The Bob and Matt Show... details below... but this is gonna be great so, like, come to it). But I do need to raise funds to pay my more-than-worthy artists helping put this show on. That is where this Indiegogo campaign and you come in. By raising the goals of $2000, I can pay my actors, stage manager and designers the bare minimum of what they are worth. So, please, help this production by donating any amount you can. Community is a big part of why the old art of theatre is still around, and I am a firm believer that we have one of the best art-supported communities right here in KC.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Future of Different Choices</h3> <p>Not only are you helping fund <i>Danny and the Deep Blue Sea</i> with a contribution to this campaign, you are helping the success of future projects for Different Choices Productions. Denver Little (another founder and the writer of <i>The Bottom of Everything</i>) and I are already talking about the next Fringe Festival project all revolving around the life of Nate Ruess, lead singer of the bands The Format and fun. Hailey Jones, founder of MoJo productions, and I are talking about co-producing a project. The wonderful, wonderful ladies at The Westport Center for the Arts and I have talked about producing an original work in the future. Many projects on the table, and if we meet our goal this time around, it will give us great confidence to move forward. Moving forward... what life is all about. The long-term goal for Different Choices is to open a theater run by an education program for the ages and donated ticket price.

for Godot (2010), Eurydice
(2011), God’s Ear (2013), and our
latest show Bob (2013), and Assassins follows this tradition.

while paying these extra expenses, we need to raise $3500 over the next 3
weeks!

yourself in,"" said W.H. Auden. <i>Les
Enfants Terribles</i> took this quote to heart and morphed Oliver Lansley, the
Artistic Director of <i>Les Enfants
Terribles</i>, and Sam Wyer's stories into a fantastical production for the
world to view. They ripped them out of the traditional medias of books, movies
or musicals. Instead, they created ""The Terrible Infants""  which uses music that has no score to both
speak and sing the dialogue. They allow for each
production company to pick up the fairy tale play and use their imagination to
create images that will enhance the already vivid tales. These ideas will be utilized to their fullest during the production by a new theater company Renegade Productions with one of the founders, Megan Holder, as the director. This production will serve as her Honor's Thesis and Theater Directing Capstone and will benefit Room to Read, a non-for-profit organization that brings books to underprivileged children in America and builds libraries stacked with books for children in underdeveloped countries around the world.</p>

Props is the next big line item because it is a prop heavy show; the more there are for the actors to use to create the characters during the show, the more fun it will be. There are some props needed that cannot be substituted. We do have to create a doll and either create her fancier version or create her so her fancy version attaches over her main body.</p><p>Any additional funds will be donated to Room to Read along with the cost of admission to the performances. If we do not reach our goal, the production will still go on somehow, someway but with an even tighter budget. </p><p></p><h3>What You Get</h3><ul>

One narrator, two storytellers and two musicians (""There's live music?"" Yes. Yes there is). These actors then create the character from each of the tales using props on costumes as they tell each story. There are a lot of wacky things like children growing tails, bees creating hives in hair, and a cloth girl stealing fabric to recreate herself. Oliver Lansley is quick to point out ""'The Terrible Infants' was about exploring that most basic form of storytelling. Though it is important to note that we never set out to create a 'children's show', rather a show that made grown-ups feel like children. A small but fundamental distinction."" Trust me, this show is the show for you.</p>
<p>Renegade Productions is a ragtag theater group that came into existence when a new work needed support to be produced. The new work ""if by yes"" by Ru Weller-Passman was successfully launched a year ago and is in discussion for production with other companies. Renegade Productions operates completely on a shoestring budget in different spaces that can be had for cheap. Only quality, thoughtful work is produced. ""The Terrible Infants"" by Oliver Lansley will be the second show produced by Renegade Productions, though hopefully there are many in their future. ""if by yes"" was an adaptation of e.e. cumming's poem, ""anyone lived in a pretty howtown"" and sold out all the seats, including the 25 chairs added last minute to accommodate. ""The Terrible Infants"" will continue the tradition of producing plays that have ties to the literary world. Why? Because cross-curriculum teaching is important.<br/></p>
<p>This production will act as Honors Thesis and Theater-Directing Capstone for Megan Holder, one of the Founders of Renegade Productions. She will be submitting it as the final two requirements for her Bachelors of Science in Theater Production at Ball State University. Another Founder, Ru-Lee Weller-Passman, will be acting as Dramaturge for this production.<br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
</div><p></p><div>We do not yet have a space for the tech rehearsals or performances so the exact cost is unknown, though based on research of the area and previous experience, the performance space will cost about $450 total. <p></p>
<p>All funds from the cost of admission will go to benefit Room to Read, a non-for-profit organization that donates book for children in underprivileged homes in the USA and sets up fully stocked libraries in underdeveloped countries.</p>
<p>These unknown costs have been budgeted at their highest cost. Should there be any money left over, it will go directly to Room to Read. As there are an abundance of spaces, finding a performance space will be no problem if we receive full funding.</p>
</div><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you do not have the funds to donate, you can help us out by sharing our Indiegogo page and encouraging your friends and family to donate in your stead. </p><p>Also, if you are in Muncie, Indiana or the surrounding area, feel free to donate metal objects or instruments to help us create the music. Also, working umbrellas of all sorts, bed sheets, abnormally-styled clothing will be useful .Send us a message on here if you have any questions or need a drop-off location. If you have oddball objects and want to know if we could use them, feel free to message on here because we probably can use it.</p><p></p></div>","Short Summary ""The way to read a fairy tale is to throw

The Impact If you are not excited already, the show has five actors. One narrator, two storytellers and two musicians (""There's live music?"" Yes. Yes there is). These actors then create the character from each of the tales using props on costumes as they tell each story. There are a lot of wacky things like children growing tails, bees creating hives in hair, and a cloth girl stealing fabric to recreate herself. Oliver Lansley is quick to point out ""'The Terrible Infants' was about exploring that most basic form of storytelling. Though it is important to note that we never set out to create a 'children's show', rather a show that made grown-ups feel like children. A small but fundamental distinction."" Trust me, this show is the show for you.
Renegade Productions is a ragtag theater group that came into existence when a new work needed support to be produced. The new work ""if by yes"" by Ru Weller-Passman was successfully launched a year ago and is in discussion for production with other companies. Renegade Productions operates completely on a shoestring budget in different spaces that can be had for cheap. Only quality, thoughtful work is produced. ""The Terrible Infants"" by Oliver Lansley will be the second show produced by Renegade Productions, though hopefully there are many in their future. ""if by yes"" was an adaptation of e.e. cumming's poem, ""anyone lived in a pretty howtown"" and sold out all the seats, including the 25 chairs added last minute to accommodate. ""The Terrible Infants"" will continue the tradition of producing plays that have ties to the literary world. Why? Because cross-curriculum teaching is important.
This production will act as Honors Thesis and Theater-Directing Capstone for Megan Holder, one of the Founders of Renegade Productions. She will be submitting it as the final two requirements for her Bachelors of Science in Theater Production at Ball State University. Another Founder, Ru-Lee Weller-Passman, will be acting as Dramaturge for this production.
    Risks & Challenges  
We do not yet have a space for the tech rehearsals or performances so the exact cost is unknown, though based on research of the area and previous experience, the performance space will cost about $450 total. 
All funds from the cost of admission will go to benefit Room to Read, a non-for-profit organization that donates book for children in underprivileged homes in the USA and sets up fully stocked libraries in underdeveloped countries.
These unknown costs have been budgeted at their highest cost. Should there be any money left over, it will go directly to Room to Read. As there are an abundance of spaces, finding a performance space will be no problem if we receive full funding.
Other Ways You Can HelpIf you do not have the funds to donate, you can help us out by sharing our Indiegogo page and encouraging your friends and family to donate in your stead. Also, if you are in Muncie, Indiana or the surrounding area, feel free to donate metal objects or instruments to help us create the music. Also, working umbrellas of all sorts, bed sheets, abnormally-styled clothing will be useful .Send us a message on here if you have any questions or need a drop-off location. If you have oddball objects and want to know if we could use them, feel free to message on here because we probably can use it.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>THE PROJECT<br/><br/>
</h3>
<div>Greetings from the Theater and Performance class of 2016 at Bard College! We are a group of 20 seniors who are creating an epic event of theater and weirdness at the Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College this spring! </div> <p>The ""Senior Project"" is the final, cumulative piece of work Bard students create during their 4th year here. We theater majors have decided to make our senior project a huge, collaborative, community event. Over the course of the past year, we brainstormed how we could create a project of which all of us could be a part. We finally landed on the incredible book, Dante's Inferno.</p>
<p>We decided to break up into small, collaborative groups that would each get 25 mins to create an original piece inspired by one of the circles of Dante's hell. Each group/circle now has an incredible cast and we have been writing/devising theater pieces that center on whatever sin we are exploring. This February, all our hard work will culminate in an uproarious, fun, absurd, gorgeous, ridiculous day of marathon theater; you will be able to come for 25 minutes<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> or 7 hours to explore with us the circles of hell we have created. </span></p>

<div>Theater is challenging to make. It is just as hard to get funding for. Yet like anything worthwhile in life, we've decided to do it anyway. In a world where we are facing global tragedies where sin, religion, violence, hatred, and apathy play a huge role, it's essential to make art that looks at these issues head on. By creating a community of artists dealing with the ancient yet still relevant themes, we are opening up a space to talk about issues that are too easy to ignore. Theater is activism; it is a way to look at something as complicated and charged as the idea of ""hell"" and ask what we can do now. Theater is community; it is a way for people of all kinds to gather in a space together and decide what we think is worth fighting for. Theater is art in a world where artists are so frequently not allowed to create anything. The ""impact"" of this show is something we can't quantify, so please come and join us and experience it for yourself.</div>

<h3>The Show. . .</h3>
<p>Immersive productions have been thrilling audiences in New York, London, and LA in recent years; now it is time for Rochester theatre-goers to experience this exciting medium for storytelling. Since its inception in 2014, WallByrd has been adding its unique vision to the theatrical landscape with productions including last fall’s THE DUCHESS OF MALFI and a fresh take on Shakespeare’s classic ROMEO AND JULIET this summer at the Highland Bowl. With DRACULA, we hope to shift perceptions of what live theatre can be and invite those who may not consider themselves theatre fans to experience the art form at its most engaging.</p>
<h3>The Team. . .</h3>
<p>With a cast and production team that blends local artists with additional professionals imported from New York City and across the state, this production promises to be an experience that is exotic while remaining rooted in the community and uniquely Rochestarian. It will be a new and exciting experience for a city already deeply committed to the performing arts.</p>
<h3>The Journey. . .</h3>
<p>Phase 1 in our development of this production is a readers’ theatre performance as part of the First Niagara Rochester Fringe Festival.  This special two-night event at the historic Lyric Theatre will give Rochester audiences a taste of this exciting new adaption and our unique immersive style. It promises to be an evening of gothic horror, classic literature, and perhaps a few surprises.</p>
<p>It will also be a chance for patrons to connect with the creators as we move forward towards a full production slated for Fall of 2017. </p>
<h3>You. . .</h3>
<p>So where do you come in? Venue rental, travel costs, compensation for the dedicated professionals we employ in Rochester and beyond— these are just a few of the costs associated with making a production like this happen. We can only do it with the support of donors like you. No amount is too small. Now is the time to get involved and help bring a new kind of performance experience to Rochester.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Last year I decided to take the  plunge and make my first solo show. Most of my ideas centred on my little brother Sean who has severe learning disabilities and autism. What started this was being asked by an audition application to write a short story, so I wrote about 'The Christmas I nearly killed my brother' (by accident). This is part of my collection of stories centring on usual experiences based around Sean, which I am now aware are not entirely normal.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">'He Ain't Heavy' will use physical theatre, aerial circus and puppetry to look at my relationship with Sean and the future responsibility I will have for him. </span></p>
<p>With this project I hope to reach<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> out to other siblings of people with special needs and autism, to raise awareness about the established groups and support networks out there and to give an insight into some of my experiences for those who don't know someone with special needs.</span></p>
So far we've nearly raised the money needed to <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">start this project, but it would be great to have your help with the final push to meet the target!</span><br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>Breakdown</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>This first stage of the project is to Research and Develop the ideas, and the budget accounts for:</span></p>
<p>Space hire</p>
<p>Creation of a bespoke puppet (named Seamus)</p>
<p>Direction from theatre and circus professionals</p>
<p>Commissioning a composed piece of music</p>
<p>Working with a producer</p>
<p>Marketing </p>
<p>Building a website</p>
<p>Delivering a workshop exploring the themes (17th October at 10am)</p>
<br/><p>We have received support from Ausform and the Arts Council of England. This final £500 will account for the final 7% and will make a massive difference, enabling us to fulfil all of the project aims. Without it we will be unable to fully document and publicise the piece, which means that whilst the rehearsals will happen the piece won't have the same impact, with less resources to raise awareness or build a profile on which to develop the project into the future.</p>

</div></div>","Last year I decided to take the  plunge and make my first solo show. Most of my ideas centred on my little brother Sean who has severe learning disabilities and autism. What started this was being asked by an audition application to write a short story, so I wrote about 'The Christmas I nearly killed my brother' (by accident). This is part of my collection of stories centring on usual experiences based around Sean, which I am now aware are not entirely normal.
'He Ain't Heavy' will use physical theatre, aerial circus and puppetry to look at my relationship with Sean and the future responsibility I will have for him. 
With this project I hope to reach out to other siblings of people with special needs and autism, to raise awareness about the established groups and support networks out there and to give an insight into some of my experiences for those who don't know someone with special needs.
So far we've nearly raised the money needed to start this project, but it would be great to have your help with the final push to meet the target!   Breakdown 
This first stage of the project is to Research and Develop the ideas, and the budget accounts for:
Space hire
Creation of a bespoke puppet (named Seamus)
Direction from theatre and circus professionals
Commissioning a composed piece of music
Working with a producer
Marketing 
Building a website
Delivering a workshop exploring the themes (17th October at 10am)
We have received support from Ausform and the Arts Council of England. This final £500 will account for the final 7% and will make a massive difference, enabling us to fulfil all of the project aims. Without it we will be unable to fully document and publicise the piece, which means that whilst the rehearsals will happen the piece won't have the same impact, with less resources to raise awareness or build a profile on which to develop the project into the future.

A message of HOPE, LOVE, and PEACE.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We cordially invite you to join the emotional journey.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>""FIGHT FOR LOVE"" is a Dance Drama close to Ms. Andressen's heart. She believes we are in a day and age where we have to fight for love or fight for the right to love whom we choose without fear of being out-cast and forced into conformity, labeled, or harmed for our choices. WE are all flesh and blood and deserve to be cherished and not stripped of our emotional being. This piece explores the brainwashing and peer pressure that results from conformity.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Ms. Andressen and her beautiful dancers, have been creating dance pieces for the Los Angeles area since 2009; going in to their 7th year. They've presented and performed these dance pieces in various, notorious festivals such as: LA Dance Festival, Mix Match Dance Festival, So Cal Dance Invitational Concert in Huntington Beach, TriArts Fest in San Pedro, ADaPT Festival in NYC, St. Barbara, Pasadena and their very own festival: Awakenings &amp; Beginnings Dance Festival to name just a few. </li>
<li>Ms. Andressen's background: Earned AA &amp; BFA degrees in dance &amp; film and merged those two loves together to form this multi-media dance company that excels presenting dance drama on stage and screen. She also earned Emmy nominations regionally for ""Baby Doe's Heartbeat"" 2004 for her production skills, writing, and music composition. </li>

Because of this, she does a lot of non-profit/charity work to raise awareness and help those who also suffered. The numbers of victims are on the rise as our world loses sight of Love. She and her dancers want to stop the suffering by using their artistry to get the message out.

<div>Orrin Whalen and Connor Hayes have been at this for years--- building an annual haunted maze for their friends, family and neighbors to enjoy on one special, spooky night in the fall. With the countless help of friends and loved ones, they have pulled off each year through the charity and good-will of their community. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This year they want to give something back to the place that started it all--- Malibu High School. The Arts Angels program inspired the two from the very beginning in acting, set design, construction and prop-making. Looking back on their roots, they want to give as much as they can back to keep that program going for the future artists of Malibu. </div> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What they need &amp; why:</h3>
<div>Building a home-haunt of this magnitude is costly. An enormous amount of time and money is put into making the annual haunt a reality, with preparation starting in the middle of summer. Funds will be distributed towards material costs, costumes, props, etc and the rest will go directly to Arts Angels. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>During the year, Orrin juggles his time doing freelance set design and art direction with leading a free fitness movement called November Project, while Connor works as the operator of a woodworking company called Hayescraft that makes artisanal crafts for local businesses and friends, so naturally their monetary dedication to this project can get them in some pretty tight spots.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>""What we're asking is to help raise the funds we need to make the haunt as amazing as we dreamed it could be. Our hope is that we raise enough to make up the difference for what we spend, and the rest will go directly to Arts Angels.""</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The Haunt will be open on October 29th &amp; 30th to the public, and the 31st by invitation into the neighborhood, with an optional donation box towards Arts Angels.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<div>Last year the Haunt was dedicated as a fundraiser for a local firefighter, Mike Downing, who had suffered a stroke earlier that year and needed a boost to keep up with the hospital expenses. In total over $5,000 was raised by the Haunt, all of which went directly to Mike and his family. This was in just two nights.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This year, over a course of three nights, they are hoping to meet a similar goal. The Arts Angels program is what keeps the arts at Malibu High School afloat, and each year the funding becomes more and more difficult to muster.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Both Orrin and Connor were a part of the arts program and can truly say that it has shaped them into the human beings they are today. They could only hope that the students at MHS are presented with the same opportunities, if not better.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>""We plan to make this year's haunt bigger and better than last year, with more tricks, more scares, and more fun for your friends and family. We thoroughly enjoy giving back to this community and we hope that you can help us reach our goal.""</div>

We need your love and support, but we could also use some Franklin's, Jackson's, Lincoln's or even Washington's to help make that happen. We have a full list of incentives for your donation listed to the right! Check us out in June at Three Clubs in Hollywood!Hollywood Fringe InfoNeed More of an Explanation?!WHO: The Sassy Classy Flashy girls of The Cherry Poppins Caburlesque Company. Madame Britannia, Lilly St. Byr, Dalia Demure, Slutty Jew Who, Oopsy Daisy, Magique Monique and all the rest of the gang are busting at the seams with triple threat talent, and are ready to shimmy it for you!WHAT: ""The Knock
Shop""  is
a modern twist on traditional cabaret and burlesque shows, with dancing,
singing, and strong comedic overtones. The Knock Shop is more than a show, it's
an experience! Think burlesque with sass AND brains! Guests are immersed
into the Cherry Poppins world by our host, who will showcase the many different women and services
available, despite struggling to maintain control of his feisty girls.
Life at the Knock Shop is a constant party, and will encourage audience members
to laugh, drink, dance and enjoy the beauty of scantily clad women.  At
least one girl will get naked…ish.
THE FUNDS we need will
go to the Fringe Festival itself for registration, the venue, advertising, the
live band, lights, sound, mics, costumes, props, set pieces, and YOU! And for a
very reasonable donation you will get a ticket!!
WHEN: This June we have 5
solid dates picked out to present our Original Musical in in the Hollywood

lucky enough to snag prime space in the prohibition style back room of Three
Clubs Cocktail Lounge. This well known hangout that we will
be taking by storm is located at 1123 Vine St, Los Angeles, CA 90038.
WHY: Well, because you believe in Women's rights, glitter, comedy,
theatre,  burlesque,  cabarets, and Sandy Chao Wang and whatever band
she is with at the moment, and drinking, and debauchery, and boas, and
feather fans, and magic acts, and tear away clothing, and tap dancing, and TLC,
and Uber or Lyft....well not so much Uber or Lyft but you can
use them to get to and from the show! You probably should in fact, for we
promise you will have WAY too good a time to drive home. Don't believe us?
Well.....believe these fine folks:

""They sing! they dance! They're hilarious! They're gorgeous! They
MAY grope you! What more do you need to see Cherry Poppins?!""- Prof. Matt
Ryan


""Cherry Poppins is like the holy trinity of Cabaret/Burlesque
shows because it molds together provocative sensuality, exquisite performance,
talent (song, dance, and otherwise), and a dash of tongue in cheek humor. Their
group isn't one dimensional since they include a vast array of talents from
singing sirens, dancing vixens, and quick witted comediennes who know exactly
how to please an audience member in all sorts of entertainment ways (and they
definitely allude to more pleasure in their act). Simply put the Poppins girls
are a hurricane of talent and nothing is ever expected, pedestrian, or off
limits, as their hurricane of personalities and skill entertain you from the
moment the show begins to the titillating ending that always makes you want to
experience more."" - Reviewer/Writer Kyle Bruehl 

""I love going to Cherry Poppins shows because they're always different. You know you're getting very talented singer/dancer/comedienne/burlesque artists, but sometimes they sexily remove clothing, sometimes they climb on audience's shoulders, sometimes they do bad-ass power ballads, sometimes they do full-on musical chorus numbers, they tap, they soft-shoe, etc. And somehow every single girl is a TRIPLE threat, is RIDICULOUSLY good looking, and it's HILARIOUS. Prepare to have a blast and not ever know what's coming next at a Cherry Poppins show...."" - Actress/Director/Teacher Kate Bowman",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>My name is Karen Irwin and I was inspired by Janis Joplin</h3> <p></p>
<p>For the last two years I have performed my one woman show, A Piece Of Her Heart: a tribute to Janis (now 'Janis, Me &amp; Bobby McGee') at The Cabaret At The Columbia Club in Indianapolis to sold out houses.  This year it sold out a month in advance which has prompted us to add another show on Thursday, July 30 at Theatre On The Square in downtown Indy (TOTS.org). Recently, I took the show to Bangor, ME to the Penobscot Theatre Company, once again selling out 4 shows.  Audience and media responses are consistently phenomenal.  And I love doing it.  We are now working towards bookings all over the country.</p>

<p>The next step is taking it to New York to do a show. For better or worse, in the big world, a review from anyone in NYC makes national venues more inclined to book a show.  However, it will cost.  We can't expect a venue to pay us, so we will have to pay to do it on our own.  </p>
<p>Making the show accessible to young women who would otherwise not be able to see it is part of my master plan (the show speaks with particular strength to women). In each market we travel to, I will find an organization to connect me with the local teenage female population who could be inspired by Janis but who don't have funds or the support network to attend live theater.  And, any money raised beyond what it takes to do the New York show will go into a fund to help buy tickets for these women.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>

<p>We need  $6,000 to produce the show in New York.  This includes:</p>

Risks & Challenges



I don't see a lot of long term risk - Janis is an easy sell.  I thank God every day that I don't sound like Anne Murray or Britney Spears.


Of course, I am going to be on the road, so any perks that have to happen in your town will have to be strategically scheduled.





The biggest challenge is that I’m doing this all myself.  Booking, producing, acting, singing and marketing are all part of my job description.  And now - fundraising.  But I already have a lot of people who are supportive and excited about what I am doing and that number is continuing to grow.  I am also learning a lot about how to do this, which makes me feel powerful.  When the time comes for me to be able to turn parts of this project over to other people, I will feel secure in the knowledge that I understand the inner workings of this business and be less likely to be taken advantage of.

<p>This
 is a show about confronting the inevitable. And culturally, we are not 
particularly adept at being able to discuss death and loss frankly, be 
it our own fears of how we’ll be remembered or how we celebrate a loved 
one’s life. One of the best (and cathartic) ways to deal with any 
painful subject is through humor. In <em>Temporary Living Arrangements</em>,
 this ranges from bad jokes training editors make to the horrifying 
absurdity of a fire at a funeral home, and the resulting “complementary 
cremations.” These anecdotes are mostly drawn from my own real life 
experience as an obituary editor, as well as my own experience with 
caring for a parent.</p>
<p>This
 show is also an analysis of how we navigate different versions of our 
life story. Prior to curtain, audience members will be invited to write 
down on a card one thing they would like to be remembered for. These 
will be anonymous and read aloud at the end. We can’t wait to read both 
honest and ridiculously flippant answers alike.  </p>
<p><strong>About Lanyard</strong></p>
<p>Lanyard Theatre
 Company is a professional theatre troupe operating primarily in the 
state of Maine and focusing purely on developing and showcasing new 
work, founded by area actor and playwright Kevin O’Leary. Now under the 
helm of founding member Joseph Barbarino and Maine native Elizabeth 
Lardie, the company has presented a staged reading of O'Leary's latest 
work, the full-length play <em>Lascaux</em>, and two lauded entries in Portland’s annual PortFringe fringe theater festival: <em>Whale Watch</em> and <em>Heart on Crackers</em>. </p>
<p>Founded
 in September 2005, the outfit blossomed out of a playwriting intensive 
called the Trigorin Project, which placed high school writers and actors
 with professional mentors from Maine and New York. After it became 
evident that community was hungry not just for students to have an 
opportunity to grow creatively but to see the produced work of the 
Trigorin mentors, Lanyard productions became semi-annual editions to the
 local arts and culture line-up.</p>
<p>We
 are working to make the Trigorin half of our operation a steady fixture
 in the area school system once again. Additionally, we are happy to 
return the company's annual programming to a minimum of two produced 
world premieres a season, and have opened up submissions beyond the 
original writers collective and encourage local playwrights to submit 
work for consideration, as either a workshop or full production.</p>

We believe that art is valuable. If we were accountants, we wouldn't give our services away for free, let alone pay to have people use our service. yT brings several wonderful artists together under one roof to create an extraordinary experience for the San Diego community.

Impact

San Diego is full of talented ""Individual Artists"" whose work goes unseen due to the lack of funding that would otherwise be available if affiliated with a larger non-profit company.  
We are the artists who have chosen to produce ourselves.  As we strive to keep our yT Exhibitions current, edgy, informative and relevant to the San Diego Community, we hope to be a strong representation of the thriving San Diego arts scene. 
yT is one of the only productions in San Diego that incorporates the artwork from local choreographers, musicians and visual artists into one low-priced exhibition, including a rooftop reception that is worth the ticket price itself.  We would like to keep it this way, because we believe art should be accessible and affordable.  Your contribution helps our cause.  
Collectively the producers of yT have worked for over 10 professional dance companies; performed, choreographed and exhibited works both nationally and internationally.  Erica Buechner, Anne Gehman and Maria Juan have been active voices in the San Diego Community and recognized for the proliferation of merging artists into new and collaborative experiences. We also impact the community directly through the free workshops and classes made available throughout the year. 

What yT Needs...
Last year yT was a raving success, complete with sold out evening shows and a great review from critic Kris Eitland of SanDiego.com, ""YOUTURN Contemporary Arts Exhibition... A head-turner that deserves a second look "".  A large part of yT's success was not only due to the support of the community and those who attended, but also the artists, performers and choreographers who graciously donated hundreds of hours of their time to participate in the exhibition. We believe that art is valuable. If we were accountants, we wouldn't give our services away for free, let alone pay to have people use our service. yT brings several wonderful artists together under one roof to create an extraordinary experience for the San Diego community. We believe there is value in that and would like to be able to give a little something back to the artists involved. In order to be able to do that, we need financial support.
The Breakdown
Production costs for yT...
Basic costs include, 10th Ave.Theater ($1500), Lighting designer ($500), Insurance ($250), Permits ($50), Food and Drink ($500). Other expenses are costumes (roughly $100 per dance), rehearsal space ($25 per hour x 75 hours per dance), flyers, programs and marketing supplies, other art supplies etc... and we haven't even thought about paying the artists yet! 
Last year we covered the basic costs of producing the event through ticket sales, but the other expenses listed above were completely out of pocket. The yT artists involved were not compensated. Due to our desire to create an even better experience for the San Diego community, this year youTurn is expanding.  This fundraising campaign is only for the cost of the 10th Ave. Theater ($1500). Our hope is that by covering the cost of the theater, we MAY be able to give the artists involved a small honorarium.


Other ways to Support yT 
One of the biggest ways you can support yT 2012 is by attending it, May 3rd-5th at the 10th Avenue Theatre at 7:30 p.m.  Tickets can be bought a youturnarts.com.  You can also share this campaign with your art-supporting friends.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

The show has plagued the nation for over 3 years with sold-out screenings, live performances, and an odd niche in the Youtube community where we can see Glee had it done heroine. The show was left open-ended on episode 210, and has been on hiatus for over a year. To this day, there is one email that I get more often than any other: ""When is Theater Class getting closure?!""

<p>Sitting on my desk is a script that has been waiting to be shot for over a year. It's an epic finale of epic proportions that we just haven't had the funds to produce.

We've had some of the best times of our lives shooting and writing this series for an audience who's given us the gratification and views to keep working. Cutting corners and watering down the script to fit an empty budget is just something I'm not willing to do. If we're going out, we're going out right! </p>
<p>This finale script is something very dear and personal to me - it's an extended episode bringing back every character who's appeared on the show, and sends them off in a heart-felt, hilarious, and clever way, just like the rest of the series has always been - and I hope one day soon, you'll be able to enjoy it for yourself. </p></span></span></span></span></div>","Theater Class's Long-Awaited Finale
