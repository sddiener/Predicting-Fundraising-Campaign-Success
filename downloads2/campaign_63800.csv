</div></div>","Short SummaryHello everyone! My name is Albin and I've got a shoutout!
My father Jon Ernholm is currently working as an volunteer in a village called Tengeru in Tanzania where he is stationed at a government hospital called Meru District Hospital, it has very limited resources and regarding aftercare almost none.
He has a background as a massage therapist and he's trying to create a way to practice and to teach the physicians these therapies, so as to give the hospital a way to provide Physiotherapy and Massage therapy aftercare which is currently almost non-existent.
What We NeedSo what's needed for this to become a reality is firstly a place to be!So the plan is to firstly buy one canvas tent to use as a space for the therapies, and if there is room in the funding to buy a second so as to be able to hold separate treatments.Also there's need to make some ground and electrical preparations for the tent.And then it's furnishings and material such as a desk, stools, shelves, benches, oils and scrubs etc.And material to make a sun and rainproof waiting booth.  The Impact Since there is near as no aftercare at all for the people who do not have money to visit the private hospitals, which is pretty much most of them, this is a measure that's really needed for people who has sustained physical trauma and other trauma alike

<p>Even though much of the visible
debris from the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident of March 2011 has been
cleared away, there are still tender wounds remaining in the hearts and minds
of many children and their families in Japan's Tohoku region. Whole family
units, neighborhoods and entire communities were devastated by the event. This
has forced hundreds of thousands of children, mothers and their families to
live in temporary housing units. Among these are the more than 71,000 children
and mothers who have been evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture's eastern
districts. They have been scattered throughout Japan, many living separated
from their fathers, grandparents and friends. In such unstable, impermanent and
stressful circumstances children can be especially susceptible to intense
anxiety, depression and in time PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome), the
symptoms of which can take many years to manifest. Recent government surveys
suggest 1 in 3 children in Tohoku are already suffering from mental health
issues.</p>

I was, in my past lives, artificial intelligence researcher and I never stopped to search for new projects, thinking that a project is important if it could give some real advantage to people.

<p>So, while I'm developing an open source device able to monitor a lot of parameters about health state of the patient and to send them to expert people that will evaluate health state, I'm also looking for a new device, a new sensor, able too give to the remote expert some real measure about a rehab path.</p>
<p>The idea is to send electromyography values while muscle is doing known work opposing to a mechanical known force, force that is produced by the sensor itself and that can controlled in an exact way from an electric signal, i.e. from the local control device or from remote expert through some specific commands to local control unit.</p>
<p>In other words, the sensor is composed by two different devices: one, standard, able to do EMG (and this one will be one of the open source proposals available on the Web). The other device, that is the real new device, is a device able to produce a force, to say applied on a lever, of well known intensity, intensity that can be varied by electronic circuit.</p>
<p>Why this sensor? Because it will help a lot of people, young or elder, to rehab staying at home, having their trend monitored by an expert from remote. A lot of saved money, better home assistance, good opportunity in all that cases when it would be impossible to have an expert near the patient.</p>
<p>Obviously, after the device will have built, we will need a lot of testing with physicians monitoring. But, anyway, a little step toward a new solution will have been done. Mainly thank to your contribution.</p>

The Impact

 Your help could mean to develop the project in a short time (at the moment I think 6/9 months). The relevance of the project is the idea of developing some device able to support rehab whose costs are low. An open source device around which communities can develop new solutions, opposing the market proposals of the big companies proposing expensive solutions.

This project wants to be open and cheap because it wants to be used by a great number of people and improved also with communities ideas.
Not a new expensive device for few people but a low cost device for all, a new approach in the eHealth.
Risks & Challenges
 The project has not great difficulties. It only needs the right stuff to work with, the time to tune exactly all the components and the production of a detailed plan so to make easy to rebuild it for anyone that would like to work on it.

Julius’s Story

 

In 1988, a band of militant rebels abducted a
twelve-year-old boy, named Julius Achon, from his home in rural Uganda. They
repeatedly drugged the child and forced him to fight alongside other kidnapped
youth. Unlike many others, this particular boy managed to escape. He went on to

from one of the most destitute regions of Africa matured into a world-class
athlete. In 1996, Julius competed in his first Olympic games, an honor that
earned again four years later.  As
awe-inspiring as this heroic tale may be, Julius’s inspirational story had only
begun. 
 

In 2003, Julius returned to the village of Awake, Uganda,
where he came across eleven orphan boys living under a bus who were fleeing from
the Lord’s Resistance Army - just as he was 15 years prior. Julius adopted all
eleven children, whom he supported with food, clothing, shelter, and school
tuition, using at first only his modest salary from endorsements. He was

village, establishing a community center, a pit latrine, and a permanent well
that provides the first sources of clean water to the village less than three

The Kristina Acuma Achon Clinic

 

The Achon Uganda Children’s Fund has recently embarked upon

<p><em>“Eating is a learned behavior, not an instinct after the first few weeks of life.”</em> – Dr. Kay Toomey</p>
<p>As parents, we must constantly feed our children. For most of us, this isn’t a problem because our children have instinctively learned to eat. Now imagine if your child never learned to eat, that hunger was never a feeling, that food and water was something foreign, that swallowing was painful marred by choking, retching, gagging and vomiting. </p>
<p><em>“Toddlers don’t eat when it hurts to eat and they are afraid it will hurt to eat.”</em> – Dr. Paul Hyman</p>
<p>From her premature birth, Lily Colonnese, the only daughter of my good friends Gary and Diane,  has dealt with over 20 diagnoses of disease and illness. The most difficult and challenging one has been learning to eat. Born a “preemie” at 27 weeks on September 15, 2003, Lily was 1 lb. 6 oz. and 11 inches long, very small and very sick. She was in the NICU for 122 days and mostly on the ventilator to keep her airway open and breathing. Acid reflux was the villain. It burned her airway, her throat, her vocal cords and her lungs. Between the horrible reflux and the invasive ventilator, Lily never learned to suck or swallow and therefore, never learned to eat. She has been on a feeding tube her entire life.</p>
<p>Lily has dealt with severe trauma and sensory issues from multiple hospitalizations, invasive testing, countless therapy sessions, far too many doctors poking and prying, and she has been unable to interact with her environment like other children. Her immune system and airway have always been severely compromised and frail.  However, through much sacrifice and many miracles along the way, Lily is learning to eat. This is where she needs your love and support.</p>
<p>Gary and Diane have borne the emotional, psychological and financial burden of caring for Lily and providing all the resources necessary for her well-being. They have literally chased therapy all over the country. Gary works extremely hard to provide for his family. Diane provides constant, 24-hour a day, care for Lily and is therefore, unable to work outside of the home. From 2007 through 2012, they lived separate lives so Gary could remain employed and provide the financial support and health insurance for Lily. Diane took care of Lily’s health and safety as they travelled around the country seeking help. This made an extremely difficult situation even more painful.</p>
<p>Gary and Diane have accumulated great debt since health insurance covers only a fraction of Lily’s medical costs-which will run as high as $40,000 annually. They have lost their home, their life savings, their 401K’s and have to live paycheck to paycheck to make ends meet. They have willingly sacrificed everything for Lily and will continue to do so because Lily is worth it. She has lived to tell her story and what a story it is.</p>
<p>In 2012, the family relocated to Dallas to work with the great medical community and therapy programs available there. Recently Lily re-entered an intensive, 30-day inpatient feeding program to help her continue to learn how to eat. However with major outpatient therapy still required for the next year, and a daily intensive feeding regimen, the medical expenses remain overwhelming.</p>
<p>In our country, feeding issues are grossly misunderstood and underserved. Unfortunately, few healthcare providers understand functional eating struggles. Therefore, medical care and services are difficult and costly to find. With rising health insurance premiums, high deductibles and out of pocket expenses, they are running out of financial resources to provide the necessary care for Lily. They receive no financial assistance from any government, state or local agency.</p>
<p>Lily turns 10 in September. It is amazing what this family has endured since her birth. Despite a tough battle, the light in the darkness is Lily. She has survived and while it is a struggle, she continues to fight the good fight.  She is a beautiful, happy and intelligent little girl, a living miracle on Earth. Lily's life is a testimony of faith, hope and love. This is a good family, strong in faith and hopeful for a healthy and bright future.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your contributions. This is a good cause and any little bit helps. Any donation is greatly appreciated and may God bless you for seeing the goodness in this family.  With gratitude,  Tim Hurley. </p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi, My name is Amy, Im 29 years old and im looking for donations to help towards my fertility treatment.......now stop.....before you judge me for asking for your help.....please ready my story.... as i share my personal story with you....</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) in 2005. I knew this would cause me to have fertility issues in the future. </p>
<p>After several years of trying with my partner, In 2008 I was refered for fertility assisted treatment where i was put on endless drugs for 2 years but nothing worked. As anyone in a simliar position to me would understand how frustrating and heartbreaking this is so in 2011 i was allowed to be given the chance of IVF and became pregnant, I was estatic and felt that after all these years, my only dream of becoming a mom has finally come true. I had a great pregnancy and was one of he lucky ones not to suffer any normal symptoms and enjoyed everyday as i saw my bump grow. My 12 week scan showed everything was developing well and we started to tell people we were expecting and so we decided we would like to know what we were having. On 30th August, which was my partner and I 5th year anniversary, we found out we were having a little girl and we were so excited, by this time i was 16 weeks and my pregnancy was going really well with no problems. We decided we liked the name Jazmyn Elizabeth, so we chosen her name perfectly.</p>
<p>A few weeks later on Sunday 11th September i felt a little uncomfortable and in a little pain, shortly after my waters broke prematurely, i was rushed to hospital where my worst fears were comfirmed, i was only 18 weeks pregnant and couldnt understand why this had happened?</p>
<p>I was kept in over night for observation and the following day a scann was performed and there it was confirmed..... there was no water around my little girl, but i could see she was a fighter as her heartbeat was strong and i knew she was telling me i had to fight for her becuase she was still alive and to e that meant everything. I was told there is a chance the waters could rebuild and this would be enough to allow her lungs to develop and was scheduled for another appointment on Thursday 15th September. I was allowed home to bedrest, the wait was agonising as i knew she was kicking inside me letting me know not to give up on her.</p>
<p>On the Wednesday 14th September i began to feel unwell and rang the hospital, they were very concerned so was rushed by an Ambulance. I was kept in overnight where my last observation was of me listening to Jazmyn's heartbeat so strong that i felt that my little girl was still here and allowing me to have hope that things maybe ok, by Thursday morning i had deteriorated further and i was in and out of conciousness but i remember them checking for Jazmyn's heartbeat again to which she was still alive, i felt relieved that she was fighting with me but now i as at risk...my life was at risk as i had developed Chorioamniotsis and i was dealt the blow that if i did not end my pregnancy that i would certainly die.......inside i did at that moment. All i ever wanted to do was protect her like any mother would for their child and i was being torn to try and fight for her life yet risk my own and i knew without me she wouldnt be able to survive.....i had to make the most difficult decision along with my partner along with the words my sister had to so difficulty say ""its not about the baby anymore Amy, its about you....you may die""</p>
<p>I was taken down to the delivery suite and a few hours later i delivered my daughter at 14:55 on Thursday 15th September 2011. I was still very poorly and with every last energy i had, i managed to hold her in my arms. Following the birth, i became severly unwell with septaceamia and was rushed to ITU, where my family and Tony were informed that i may not make it through the night and to prepare for the worst......they were told that i may only have a few hours.I was put on a ventilator to allow me to breathe after the sepsis attacked my lungs. I spent 5 days in ITU where shortly i began to recover. After 8 days in hospital i was finally allowed hospital where i was faced with the realisation that not only did i nearly die but i actually lost my daughter. I learned that i had a weak cervix following abnormal cells i had when i was 22 and had small treatment for it that i wasnt made aware that would cause me to have this. I flt empty...angry and blamed myself that i couldnt protect her....for days,weeks...i was recovering home after being on long sick leave from work yet every day went by in a blur where i mostly spent in bed apart from visitors that came and went and was allowed to go home to their families...yet where was mine?...I did everything right that a woman was supposed to yet i was the one who got punished? and thats all i could think why did this happen to me? I soon returned to work and i Christmas was on its way where my siblings got to enjoy their christmas with their children, yet my daughter was going to be still growing inside me and i felt i had nothing.</p>
<p>New year came and went but Jazmyn's due date was fast approaching 11th February 2012, we decided that we wanted to make her day a positive and one to be remembered for the right reasons and not the wrong....so we arranged after 6 long years we would get married and so the planning was arranged within 6 weeks. During that time the IVF clinic told me that i was allowed another go in March so to me that was better than any Honeymoon i could have. I was delighted when it worked again and felt our little girl was looking down on us. Again my pregnancy was going really well and no symptoms that we mostly dread. Upon my 8 week scan we found out were having twins!! we were very excited yet i was terribly nervous due to my weak cervix i was worried how much my body could cope. My consultant put a sutue in to support and strengthen my cervix when i was 15 weeks.I took a few weeks off work and was advised that this was going to be a high risk pregnancy but he was confident that things will be ok providing i had no stress and go on early leave at 22 weeks from work. I did all i was told and bedrested. Due to ow early twins can come, his aim was to get me past 28 weeks because this could allow them to survive outside the wormb.</p>
<p>Due to my pregnancy being high risk, we decided to find out what we were having so we could prepare early just incase. To our surprise we found out were having a boy and a girl!!!!! i felt that my little girl was shining down upon us and allowing us to have a completed family. The weeks flew by and we decided that our little boy was to be called Jaxon and our little girl was to be called Tamzyn. Everytime we spoke to them we kept accidently refering her as Jazmyn so we decided to rename her Jazlynne. ""Jaz"" - after Jazmyn and ""Lynne"" after my late mom who i lost when i was 14 . We felt that name was more perfect and unique.</p>
<p>As i was approaching 18weeks i began to feel alittle anxious but that soon passed where i could look forward to seeing my 20 week scan and the twins were doing so well that seeing them jump around felt me with joy and confidence. I left work to do as i was instructed so at 22 weeks and took bedrest leave. I enjoy relaxing at home and the thoughts for the future of having them here.</p>
<p>One Saturday night in July i began to have small contractions but wasnt sure it was that but knew it wasnt right and so i called the hospital who asked for me to go down to be checked out. I was 24.5 weeks pregnant, after some monitoring i was given the dreaded news i didnt think i could ever hear again... i was going into labour......how could i be? again i did everything right...did as i was told nd yet again im being put through this?</p>
<p>The hospital put me on drugs to try and stop my contractions but it didnt work so the only thing left to do was to give me steroid injections to help their lungs and prepare them for the outside world. I was in labour for over 2 days and by this time i was exhausted and opted to have an epidural to help allow me some time to find some strength to push. On Monday 30th July our little boy Jaxon came into the world with his little cry, hearing him cry was a relief as i knew that was a good sign, he weighed 1lb 10oz. He was rushed to Neonatal where he was stabalized and was showing good progression. Shortly after our little girl Jazlynne was born weighing 1lb 6oz and again she let out a cry and the same feeling of relief overcame me and i cried with excitement. I knew they were born alive and they were ok, they were premature but every hour that went by was a good sign. i couldnt go and see them straight away as i was on drugs to help me after the labour. </p>
<p>In the middle of my IV treatment a few hours after giving birth i was given some news that our little boy Jaxon wasnt responding so well as they indicated that he had a bleed to the brain,  and that he would have little quality of life. my heart was broken all over again, they paused my treatment and i was wheeled down with all these wires and monitors to go and see him. There he was tiny but perfect....he was so beautiful with his jet black hair, we were asked if he wanted to be christened so we decided it had to be done, it gave me some peace, shortly after we had to say goodbye and turn the machine off, we held him until his heart stopped beating and promised him that Mommy and Daddy will always be with him and love him just like Jazmyn.</p>
<p>I felt like my world had been smashed into pieces as i was forced to go back to resume my treatment and i sat there feeling numb. .... and my mind was a blur with thoughts. I knew our little girl was also fighting and every hour  were told she was doing so well. The moment i finished treatment i had a shower and got to Neo as quick as i could and there Jazlynne was, living,breathing and alive. Se made me chuckle how she ket moving the bubble wrap off her and i thought shes going to be a madam, her hair was much lighter than Jaxons, it was a sandy colour. I watched her for aslong as i could before i felt incredibly exhausted. I decided to rest so i could gain some more energy to see and spend time with her. I was assured that she was strong and showing excellent responses to medication and that she was going to be ok despite of how early she was.</p>
<p>Early hours on Tuesday 31st July i was awoken to be told i needed to go to Neo as Jazlynne had detiorated. I got there as quick as my legs would take me even though i was still recovering from the epidural. I was given the bad news that the safacent in her lungs only went in her right lung and caused her left lung to blow. I heard them say that they heard her cry and new something was wrong. i felt like my whole world was collapsing as they i knew she was crying to tell them they intervened where they stabalised her and she was responding well but took a turn for the worst again where they told me there was nothing more they could do for her that i needed to decide what to do even though i knew there was only one thing that i had to be forced to do. I couldnt beleive what i had been told and thought ""Not the both of them please"".....</p>
<p>Jazlynne was put in my arms where i could hold her until she had passed away, she was so beautiful like her brother, i held her little fingers and looked at her, she was such a strong little girl that it was over an hour until she died. </p>
<p>I dont even remember how i got back to the family room but all i know was that i cried myself to sleep and exhausted myself out. The following day i was discharged and i was coming home empty all over again. </p>
<p>I struggled on how to deal with the twins death, all i knew was i wanted this pain to go away and for my mind just to blank it all out and the only way i felt i could cope was arranginga charity event after Shropshire SANDs coming through and helping me have th twins buried next to their sister rather than 25 miles away from our home in Bushbury. I found strength in raising money for such a good cause and allowing me to do something good in helping other parents that have suffered the lose of their baby.</p>
<p>I had such amazing support, incredible amount of donations that we all managed to raise over £5,500. Something that i never thought i could achieve as well as raise awareness, i met truely inspirational people along the way and found som comfort from it all.</p>
<p>In December i felt i was ready to have another IVF treatment but unfortunatley it didnt work, i felt like i was suffering another lose even though it wasnt. I decided that i needed to take time out and concentrate on getting my mind and body healthy so took cycling up along with bootcamp. </p>
<p>Due to my history of a weak cervix i discussed with my consultant that i needed something more assuring after reasearching about a TAC, where i would have a C-section like operation that would allow me to 95% to carry full term. i decided this was my best option as i wasnt ready to give up on trying to have a rainbow baby. After 4 months i finally was able to have the operation. 7 weeks later i had another go on IVF with the egg that i have in storage...this time i was in strong hope this would work, i felt i did everything i could to allow me to conceive successfully.....again unfortunatley it didnt work and i took it really bad where i even contemplated on giving up and facing the fact i would never have a baby of my own. I looked at my 7 inch scar on my stomach and remembered why i had this operation, how far ive come in life. i decided i couldnt wait another 6 months as that was sometimes as painful as a negative pregnancy test so i researched and looked into Egg Sharing programme where i am able to receive IVF at a reduced cost i i could donate half of my eggs to a recipient. I feel this is a perfect idea to not only helping someone out there but also another chance of maybe conceiving again. </p>
<p>Liverpool Womens Hospital have an excellent pregnancy care plan ready and waiting for me. Shrewsbury Clinic are fantastic but i need to be a rainbow mommy before 2013 is out so i can have hope that next year when i turn 30 that i will eventually have what ive always dreamed of.</p>
<p>I am very proud of all my babies and i will forever be their mommy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know this is a big ask and some may even think im being cheeky but i have alot of supportive people who are willing to help me do this.</p>
<p>Please help me...........</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank You Amy xxx</p>

<p> </p></div>","My Story
Hi, My name is Amy, Im 29 years old and im looking for donations to help towards my fertility treatment.......now stop.....before you judge me for asking for your help.....please ready my story.... as i share my personal story with you....
I was diagnosed with PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) in 2005. I knew this would cause me to have fertility issues in the future. 
After several years of trying with my partner, In 2008 I was refered for fertility assisted treatment where i was put on endless drugs for 2 years but nothing worked. As anyone in a simliar position to me would understand how frustrating and heartbreaking this is so in 2011 i was allowed to be given the chance of IVF and became pregnant, I was estatic and felt that after all these years, my only dream of becoming a mom has finally come true. I had a great pregnancy and was one of he lucky ones not to suffer any normal symptoms and enjoyed everyday as i saw my bump grow. My 12 week scan showed everything was developing well and we started to tell people we were expecting and so we decided we would like to know what we were having. On 30th August, which was my partner and I 5th year anniversary, we found out we were having a little girl and we were so excited, by this time i was 16 weeks and my pregnancy was going really well with no problems. We decided we liked the name Jazmyn Elizabeth, so we chosen her name perfectly.
A few weeks later on Sunday 11th September i felt a little uncomfortable and in a little pain, shortly after my waters broke prematurely, i was rushed to hospital where my worst fears were comfirmed, i was only 18 weeks pregnant and couldnt understand why this had happened?
I was kept in over night for observation and the following day a scann was performed and there it was confirmed..... there was no water around my little girl, but i could see she was a fighter as her heartbeat was strong and i knew she was telling me i had to fight for her becuase she was still alive and to e that meant everything. I was told there is a chance the waters could rebuild and this would be enough to allow her lungs to develop and was scheduled for another appointment on Thursday 15th September. I was allowed home to bedrest, the wait was agonising as i knew she was kicking inside me letting me know not to give up on her.
On the Wednesday 14th September i began to feel unwell and rang the hospital, they were very concerned so was rushed by an Ambulance. I was kept in overnight where my last observation was of me listening to Jazmyn's heartbeat so strong that i felt that my little girl was still here and allowing me to have hope that things maybe ok, by Thursday morning i had deteriorated further and i was in and out of conciousness but i remember them checking for Jazmyn's heartbeat again to which she was still alive, i felt relieved that she was fighting with me but now i as at risk...my life was at risk as i had developed Chorioamniotsis and i was dealt the blow that if i did not end my pregnancy that i would certainly die.......inside i did at that moment. All i ever wanted to do was protect her like any mother would for their child and i was being torn to try and fight for her life yet risk my own and i knew without me she wouldnt be able to survive.....i had to make the most difficult decision along with my partner along with the words my sister had to so difficulty say ""its not about the baby anymore Amy, its about you....you may die""
I was taken down to the delivery suite and a few hours later i delivered my daughter at 14:55 on Thursday 15th September 2011. I was still very poorly and with every last energy i had, i managed to hold her in my arms. Following the birth, i became severly unwell with septaceamia and was rushed to ITU, where my family and Tony were informed that i may not make it through the night and to prepare for the worst......they were told that i may only have a few hours.I was put on a ventilator to allow me to breathe after the sepsis attacked my lungs. I spent 5 days in ITU where shortly i began to recover. After 8 days in hospital i was finally allowed hospital where i was faced with the realisation that not only did i nearly die but i actually lost my daughter. I learned that i had a weak cervix following abnormal cells i had when i was 22 and had small treatment for it that i wasnt made aware that would cause me to have this. I flt empty...angry and blamed myself that i couldnt protect her....for days,weeks...i was recovering home after being on long sick leave from work yet every day went by in a blur where i mostly spent in bed apart from visitors that came and went and was allowed to go home to their families...yet where was mine?...I did everything right that a woman was supposed to yet i was the one who got punished? and thats all i could think why did this happen to me? I soon returned to work and i Christmas was on its way where my siblings got to enjoy their christmas with their children, yet my daughter was going to be still growing inside me and i felt i had nothing.
New year came and went but Jazmyn's due date was fast approaching 11th February 2012, we decided that we wanted to make her day a positive and one to be remembered for the right reasons and not the wrong....so we arranged after 6 long years we would get married and so the planning was arranged within 6 weeks. During that time the IVF clinic told me that i was allowed another go in March so to me that was better than any Honeymoon i could have. I was delighted when it worked again and felt our little girl was looking down on us. Again my pregnancy was going really well and no symptoms that we mostly dread. Upon my 8 week scan we found out were having twins!! we were very excited yet i was terribly nervous due to my weak cervix i was worried how much my body could cope. My consultant put a sutue in to support and strengthen my cervix when i was 15 weeks.I took a few weeks off work and was advised that this was going to be a high risk pregnancy but he was confident that things will be ok providing i had no stress and go on early leave at 22 weeks from work. I did all i was told and bedrested. Due to ow early twins can come, his aim was to get me past 28 weeks because this could allow them to survive outside the wormb.
Due to my pregnancy being high risk, we decided to find out what we were having so we could prepare early just incase. To our surprise we found out were having a boy and a girl!!!!! i felt that my little girl was shining down upon us and allowing us to have a completed family. The weeks flew by and we decided that our little boy was to be called Jaxon and our little girl was to be called Tamzyn. Everytime we spoke to them we kept accidently refering her as Jazmyn so we decided to rename her Jazlynne. ""Jaz"" - after Jazmyn and ""Lynne"" after my late mom who i lost when i was 14 . We felt that name was more perfect and unique.
As i was approaching 18weeks i began to feel alittle anxious but that soon passed where i could look forward to seeing my 20 week scan and the twins were doing so well that seeing them jump around felt me with joy and confidence. I left work to do as i was instructed so at 22 weeks and took bedrest leave. I enjoy relaxing at home and the thoughts for the future of having them here.
One Saturday night in July i began to have small contractions but wasnt sure it was that but knew it wasnt right and so i called the hospital who asked for me to go down to be checked out. I was 24.5 weeks pregnant, after some monitoring i was given the dreaded news i didnt think i could ever hear again... i was going into labour......how could i be? again i did everything right...did as i was told nd yet again im being put through this?
The hospital put me on drugs to try and stop my contractions but it didnt work so the only thing left to do was to give me steroid injections to help their lungs and prepare them for the outside world. I was in labour for over 2 days and by this time i was exhausted and opted to have an epidural to help allow me some time to find some strength to push. On Monday 30th July our little boy Jaxon came into the world with his little cry, hearing him cry was a relief as i knew that was a good sign, he weighed 1lb 10oz. He was rushed to Neonatal where he was stabalized and was showing good progression. Shortly after our little girl Jazlynne was born weighing 1lb 6oz and again she let out a cry and the same feeling of relief overcame me and i cried with excitement.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
About a month ago, Ivan was in a terrible car accident in Rakitovo, Bulgaria.<br/><br/>He has been in the hospital in Plovdiv ever since, and doctors have been fighting to keep him alive.  Recently, the doctors told his parents that he needs a shunt (implant in Bulgarian) to regulate the intracranial pressure (ICP) in his brain.  Until now, this fluid has been collected through the use of tubes and bags in the hospital.  This shunt would be able to help regulate his ICP for the next two to three years while he heals.   </div>

<p>Kangaroo bottle delivers a alkalized mineral water, which will aid in weight-loss.</p>
<p>What you are about to read may surprise you. In fact, you  will probably forward this article to both your friends and family. </p>
<p>Hi, I’m Dr. David Haacke and I want to tell you that
malnutrition may be a key reason for the USA Obesity epidemic</p>
<p>The Problem is Simply this: The foods we eat are empty! They
may be green and really-healthy looking, however the truth is that most of the
food we eat has been depleted of a large percentage of the minerals, vitamins
and nutrients that our bodies need. This is serious. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Why is this important! Minerals are important cofactors the
body needs to metabolize the food you eat. Without restoring these depleted
minerals weight loss on any diet is difficult if not impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Omergy Restorative Water will replenish these lost minerals in your body. Once restored, your body will begin to metabolize the food you eat, turning fat into energy. Drink the water, drink our fast weight-loss shot in the morning,for lunch, mix our protein shake mix into the water and nurse the water until your evening meal. I promise you, your weight-loss efforts will be successful </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">First we start with our Omergy Mineral Water.</span><br/></p>
<p>Our Omergy water has food sourced minerals added to every
bottle so your body can readily absorb the minerals it is craving.  Minerals are also what give water its great refreshing
flavor, and we include all the important trace minerals for your health.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Fast Weight-loss Shot, which is found inside a 2-ouncee shot
in our Omergy Kangaroo Bottle is a proprietary blend of herbs, vitamins, and
other nutrients to promote healthy metabolism, and weight loss.  This shot will help boost your metabolism,
and speed weight loss. This is what I recommend that you consume at the start
of each day.  Again, drink an Omergy protein shake for your mid-day meal.. Drink a shake in addition to the Omergy Fast Weight-loss product. </span><br/></p>
</div>
</div><div>We can place scores of different products in our shots: A nutritional supplement, An energy drink (5-Hour Omergy), melatonin, a sleep inducing supplement, DHEA, A testosterone or HGH simulator, a laxative, or cherry/lime flavored zinc cold fighter, a joint lubricant like our Ibuproflex glucosamine chondroitin supplement, an immune booster or  my wife's favorite, a protein shake mix (A protein power, which is mixed into the water, in three flavors vanilla, chocolate &amp; strawberry), Different juices: Acai', Noni, Magosteen or a blend of super fruits like our Omergy Juice. The list can get extensive, We could easily take up a whole grocery store isle. </div><div>There is a humanitarian aspect to our effort. We have committed to donate a bottle of Nurish or its equivalency for ever bottle of Omergy sold.  </div><div>Drop for Drop, Bite for Bite.</div><div> I can't imagine a person who is in a crisis situation who is dying of thirst, who is not also hungry. Our product provides 150 minerals, vitamins, micro-nutrients, 13 grams of protein, you can see the whole list of ingredients on Omergy.com. It will do what it is supposed to do and that is to provide enough nourishment and hydration to keep a person alive for a few days up to a week. When you support this effort, you are also helping us alleviate some of the suffering that many are experiencing through the world. </div><div>

See above video clip. </div><div>
<p>Hi I am Dr Haacke, I want to start out by explaining why u<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">nhealthy, undernourished people
find it almost impossible to lose weight!</span></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>The simple answer is the foods we eat are empty! They may be green and really-healthy looking, however the truth is that almost all of the food we eat has been depleted of a large percentage of the minerals, vitamins and nutrients that our body’s need. This is serious.</p>
<p><b>Let me illustrate.</b>  An
apple grown in early 1900’s had the trace mineral content that would take 25 of
today’s apples to equal. </p>
<p><b>Why is this important!</b> Minerals are important co-factors the
body needs to metabolize the food you eat. Without restoring these depleted
minerals permanent weight loss on any diet is difficult if not impossible.</p>
<p>That is pretty much why it is so hard to permanently lose
weight, and why yoyo diet trends are the norm. 
Where 10 pounds is lost then gained again and again.</p>
<p>Two important minerals that are lost in the processesing of
food, and depleted in conventionally grown agriculture are Magnesium and
Chromium.  Both of these minerals are
directly involved in healthy metabolic pathways, and when deficient lead to
slower metabolism, and inefficient sugar metabolism.  Both of which cause fatigue, weight gain, and
metabolic dysfunction.</p>
<p>Our Omergy water has food sourced minerals added to every
bottle so your body can readily absorb the minerals it is craving.  Minerals are also what gives water its great refreshing
flavor, and we include all the important trace minerals for your health.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In addition to our great Omergy mineral water comes a
proprietary blend of herbs, vitamins, and other nutrients to promote healthy
metabolism, and weight loss.  (Green Tea
Extract, Chromium, Selenium, Magnesium, Hoodia extract, B-Vitamins, Bitter
Orange Extract, Hesperidin, Naringin, Forskolin, 7-KetoDHEA, </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Garcinia Cambogia (See above video)</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">,

</div></div>","Kangaroo bottle delivers a alkalized mineral water, which will aid in weight-loss.
What you are about to read may surprise you. In fact, you  will probably forward this article to both your friends and family. 
Hi, I’m Dr. David Haacke and I want to tell you that
malnutrition may be a key reason for the USA Obesity epidemic
The Problem is Simply this: The foods we eat are empty! They
may be green and really-healthy looking, however the truth is that most of the
food we eat has been depleted of a large percentage of the minerals, vitamins
and nutrients that our bodies need. This is serious. 
Why is this important! Minerals are important cofactors the
body needs to metabolize the food you eat. Without restoring these depleted
minerals weight loss on any diet is difficult if not impossible.
Omergy Restorative Water will replenish these lost minerals in your body. Once restored, your body will begin to metabolize the food you eat, turning fat into energy. Drink the water, drink our fast weight-loss shot in the morning,for lunch, mix our protein shake mix into the water and nurse the water until your evening meal. I promise you, your weight-loss efforts will be successful 
First we start with our Omergy Mineral Water.
Our Omergy water has food sourced minerals added to every
bottle so your body can readily absorb the minerals it is craving.  Minerals are also what give water its great refreshing
flavor, and we include all the important trace minerals for your health.
Fast Weight-loss Shot, which is found inside a 2-ouncee shot
in our Omergy Kangaroo Bottle is a proprietary blend of herbs, vitamins, and
other nutrients to promote healthy metabolism, and weight loss.  This shot will help boost your metabolism,
and speed weight loss. This is what I recommend that you consume at the start
of each day.  Again, drink an Omergy protein shake for your mid-day meal.. Drink a shake in addition to the Omergy Fast Weight-loss product. 

We can place scores of different products in our shots: A nutritional supplement, An energy drink (5-Hour Omergy), melatonin, a sleep inducing supplement, DHEA, A testosterone or HGH simulator, a laxative, or cherry/lime flavored zinc cold fighter, a joint lubricant like our Ibuproflex glucosamine chondroitin supplement, an immune booster or  my wife's favorite, a protein shake mix (A protein power, which is mixed into the water, in three flavors vanilla, chocolate & strawberry), Different juices: Acai', Noni, Magosteen or a blend of super fruits like our Omergy Juice. The list can get extensive, We could easily take up a whole grocery store isle. There is a humanitarian aspect to our effort. We have committed to donate a bottle of Nurish or its equivalency for ever bottle of Omergy sold.  Drop for Drop, Bite for Bite. I can't imagine a person who is in a crisis situation who is dying of thirst, who is not also hungry. Our product provides 150 minerals, vitamins, micro-nutrients, 13 grams of protein, you can see the whole list of ingredients on Omergy.com. It will do what it is supposed to do and that is to provide enough nourishment and hydration to keep a person alive for a few days up to a week. When you support this effort, you are also helping us alleviate some of the suffering that many are experiencing through the world. 
If we are successful in raising funds, we will use the funds to pay for the tooling for our bottle and cap, an office, warehouse and the equipment needed to make our own caps, bottles and equipment needed to bottle our product. This is neccesssary if we are going to be able to keep our profits high enough to cover the cost associated with donating product to those in need. 




I will  Dr.Haacke explain why our fast weight-loss product is superior to any other now on the market. See above video clip. 
Hi I am Dr Haacke, I want to start out by explaining why unhealthy, undernourished people
find it almost impossible to lose weight!

The simple answer is the foods we eat are empty! They may be green and really-healthy looking, however the truth is that almost all of the food we eat has been depleted of a large percentage of the minerals, vitamins and nutrients that our body’s need. This is serious.
Let me illustrate.  An
apple grown in early 1900’s had the trace mineral content that would take 25 of
today’s apples to equal. 
Why is this important! Minerals are important co-factors the
body needs to metabolize the food you eat. Without restoring these depleted
minerals permanent weight loss on any diet is difficult if not impossible.
That is pretty much why it is so hard to permanently lose
weight, and why yoyo diet trends are the norm. 
Where 10 pounds is lost then gained again and again.
Two important minerals that are lost in the processesing of
food, and depleted in conventionally grown agriculture are Magnesium and
Chromium.  Both of these minerals are
directly involved in healthy metabolic pathways, and when deficient lead to
slower metabolism, and inefficient sugar metabolism.  Both of which cause fatigue, weight gain, and
metabolic dysfunction.
Our Omergy water has food sourced minerals added to every
bottle so your body can readily absorb the minerals it is craving.  Minerals are also what gives water its great refreshing
flavor, and we include all the important trace minerals for your health.
In addition to our great Omergy mineral water comes a
proprietary blend of herbs, vitamins, and other nutrients to promote healthy
metabolism, and weight loss.  (Green Tea
Extract, Chromium, Selenium, Magnesium, Hoodia extract, B-Vitamins, Bitter
Orange Extract, Hesperidin, Naringin, Forskolin, 7-KetoDHEA, Garcinia Cambogia (See above video),
Raspberry Ketone, Cinnamon, Velvet Bean, Cocoa Extract, Guarana, Vitamins A, C,
D, E, K.) that come in a convenient Fast Weight-loss shot that accompanies our
water.  This boost helps boost your
metabolism, and speed weight loss. You can order a case of 12 bottles of Omergy Restorative Water, with our kangaroo Garcinia Cambogia Fast Weight-loss shots in our perk section.  



Omergy International is a start-up, which  once funded, will allow our team to produce these much needed water and supplement formulas and bottle them. 
It is important that we are able to do this in-house, so we can control the quality and cost of our product. Product, which when used will help you, our friends to enjoy health and fitness. 
Improving your health is the essence of Omergy. 
Let me share with you a little more of the Omergy philosophy. 

First and foremost, it is our stated goal to provide you, our friends, family and neighbors, products, which will help you obtain & enjoy long-lasting vibrant health. 
Here is another line of products, which we intend to create.
Omergy 5-days to total nutritional restoration regimen. 
 Monday Consume Omergy Restorative Water with the Green Shot.(See chart below)
Tuesday Consume Omergy Restorative Water with the Reds Shot.
Wednesday Consume Omergy Restorative Water with the Orange Shot.
Thursday Consume Omergy Restorative Water with the White Shot.
Friday Consume Omergy Restorative Water with the Purple Shot.
Saturday: Consume your choice of Omergy Restorative Water with either Omergy Fast Weight-Loss Shot, Omergy Juice Shot or Omergy Immune Boost Shot.  
The more you stick to this regimen the more energy you will enjoy and stronger your immune system will become. Choose the week supply of Omergy 5-days to Total Nutritional Restoration Regimen Perk, or the 4 week supply of Omergy 5-days to total nutritional restoration regimen and receive 4 FREE bottles of Omergy Restorative Water with Omergy Juice Shot. 

To this end we are developing formulas for some very exceptional products. Let me tell you about them: 


We start with our Omergy RestoreLife 7-Super Fruit Juice. Omergy Juice can be consumed alone, but more importantly, it is the nutritional soup which we use to fortify many of our  supplements, like 5-Hour Omergy. If you are going to consume a caffeinated supplements, I suggest that taking one that included a wide-spectrum nutritional supplement, packed full of vitamins, anti-oxidants, phytonutrients along with our mineral water, will help your body recover from the unhealthy aspects of why you need a caffeinated drink to begin with. Given the choice between 5-Hour Energy and 5-Hour Omergy we would hope you would choose 5-Hour Omergy. 

However, I don't want overlook our Omergy Restorative water. The truth is even our Omergy Juice is not going to have the positive intended impact on our health, unless we are able to re-infuse the minerals our body's need to metabolize the nutrients of Omergy's super fruits. 
The same with nearly all of the supplements that will be contained within the kangaroo shots in our Omergy Restorative Water. 
Unlike OTC (Over The Counter) supplements, which may have the necessary supplemental ingredients, our supplement formulas are created with both the highest quality ingredients, but just as importantly we create supplements, which are easily assimilated by our body's. 
The goal is to help you, our friends, neighbors and family return to and enjoy long-lasting vibrant health and concurrently help those throughout the world who are in so much distress and needless suffering. That is the true spirit of Omergy

When you visit any of our restaurants you will not find soft drinks. Instead we will provide inexpensive green smoothies and other healthy natural juices.  Our goal is to put a new face on fast food with eateries that stay away from unhealthy foods and sugars, and especially avoid preservatives, which can be more damaging then the product is healthy. 

Once launched, we will sell our product via the Internet, using social media, Google Ad Word, YouTube, and a radio, television performance-based direct-response advertising campaign.  
Hopefully, we will enjoy significant profits, which will let us build our Omergy restaurants and Omergy health restoring spa hotels. 
If you are concerned about your choices in a market place filled with unhealthy fast food giants, then I encourage to pre-order our health restoring products, or book a week stay at our St George health restoring retreat, where I will personally supervise your medical evaluation and put you on a regimen of exercise and diet that will get to the root of your health concerns. When it the last time you had vibrant energy?  Omergy Health Spas will help return to a vibrant health condition. When I work with my patients, it is my goal to teach them the tool needed so they can get and stay healthy. Where these retreats are not cheap, when you consider 
By combining Omergy’s Restorative
Water & FAST Weight-loss  Shot™: The Water restores the depleted minerals and
micro-nutirents and then the contained 2-ounce shot of Garcinia Cambogia, Fiber and
13 grams of protein helps us to control
our appetite and lose the desired weight
without feeling hungry.  The results can
be fast, healthy weight-loss. 
Here is the best part, when you
contribute $100 we will send you  a case of  12-bottles of Omergy Restorative
Water with the contained FAST Weight-loss  Shots™.  (This amount includes S&H)
Omergy Restorative Water is sold with a variety of different supplements, as can be seen in our project image. The Omergy Water &
Hunger Project is dedicated to providing a bottle of water and a meal replacement
shot for every bottle of Omergy Water sold. 


Everyday thousands
of children die from malnutrition and unclean water.We commit to either provide
an aid organization, like the Red Cross, People Water or LDS Welfare services an actual bottle of
water with a meal replacement shot or give the monetary equivalent, which will contribute to the providing food and water to those in need. P&G is an organization who is providing safe drinking water to many in need. This is one of organizations that we will provide both Omergy Water and/or the equivalency in cash for every Bottle of any Omergy sold. 

Almost one billion people in the developing world do not have access to clean drinking water. As a result, thousands of children die every day. The P&G Children’s Safe Drinking Water (CSDW) Programme reaches these people through PUR packets, a water purifying technology developed by P&G, here in the UK at our Innovation Centre in Newcastle and in conjunction with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Most of the time when a person is in dire straights and in need water, they are also in need of nourishment. Above is a picture of Omergy Nurish™, which would be distributed to organizations like Red Cross, P&G, People Water, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Welfare Square and when possible, directly to those in need. 
In order to make any impact on this problem, we must be able to be competitive in marketplace. As a start-up we would not be able to go to co-packers and bottlers simply due to the minimums orders most of these providers require. Also, and more importantly, we absolutely must control quality. By owning the equipment needed for a small bottle manufacturing and bottling we are able to do both. This of course will allow us to enjoy the type of profits needed to contribute to world's clean water and hunger problems. 
That means at a minimum, we have to our supplement production in house. This is why we are raising funds, so we can launch with the equipment needed to mold our bottles and to bring the filling of our products in-house. Without that ability, our cost to produce our product would not allow us the margins needed to contribute the equivalent of a bottle of water and nourishment (Nurish™ Meal Replacement Shot) for every bottle of water we sell. 

First, we are a for profit company, and intend to develop many different companies under the Omergy Brand, and if I am at the helm of these entities I promise you that we will contribute as much as we are able to alleviate these burdens, which many find themselves facing. Whether, due to famine, war, poverty or lack of education, we will do all we can to organize the resources to eradicate and correct the  problem. 
The first problem we are addressing is malnutrition and how it contributes to obesity. If you have ever unsuccessfully attempted to drop a few pounds by dieting you will will interested in our products and our approach to diet and nutrition.

<h3>
</h3><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>           The cause we are working for is a community of equality regardless of differences or restrictions infringed upon individuals. More specifically, we are working with high school aged students that have been limited in their school community due to special needs or disabilities. Students of general education and special education are separated by classes in school causing their interactions to be scarce. </p>
<p>          As high school student myself, I saw an obstacle that needed to be overcome. In this idea, the club Students for Students was created. This club gave special and general educations students the chance to come together and build friendships. After seeing the success created from this high school club, we wanted to find a way to help continue these friendships. Leading to the creation of Camp Connected.</p>
<p>          Camp Connected will be a week long summer camp from August 18th- August 22nd, taking place at the local recreational center. The camp will be from 9am until 1 pm on all of these days. Each day will have a combination of special and general education students whom will participate in various athletic and artistic activities together.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>         Since we
know how great of an opportunity this will be for all of the teens involved, our
goal is to make this camp completely free so that there is no financial strain
caused if anyone wishes to participate. In order to make this happen, we need help
from ALL of you through donations. </p>
<p>         Donations
given will cover the costs of water, snacks, lunches, and supplies for
activities such as craft materials and sport gear. Donations of any shape and
size are welcome! An alternative donation form is to sponsor a camper. By
donating $20 you will be sponsoring a camper for one day. By donating $100 you
will be sponsoring a camper for the entire week. </p>
<p>         As optimists
and frugal spenders, we hope to have money left over after the camp is over.
All money that remains will be donated to the local high schools special
education budget. By pulling out a checkbook or even just rummaging through for
some pocket change, your donation will impact multiple communities and numerous
individuals. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>         Now on the
outside it seems like we are just having teenagers hang out with one another,
which essentially is true. However we are asking for funding to help teens of disabilities
form those essential social skills that are needed by all people, give them a
sense of belonging in a broader community then those constricted ones lacking
variety, and let them build friendships with peers that’ll be able to care
about them. </p>
<p>         Also it isn’t
just the teens of special needs that benefit, but also the peers of general
education that come as well. They get to spend time with the other students in
school they don’t get to see as often, and learn to understand how few
differences there really are between each other. When all of the teens are
together the positivity and pure joy of one bounces to another until everyone
there just feels welcome and happy.
This has been seen in my high schools current club Students for Students and is bound to grow in this camp experience. 
</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>         Our biggest
obstacle for this camp is finances. Since this camp started as a simple idea,
we also started with a budget of zero. I know that because of the hard work put
in by myself and others who know this camp needs to happen; we will overcome
this current struggle. We have volunteered tons and tons of our personal time
solely because of our passion for this cause. All participants in this camp
will also be volunteering purely to help their community.</p>
<p>         If for some
reason we are unable to reach our needed amount of money, alterations may need
to be made in order to salvage the idea, but none of us want to reach that
position. Changing the plan could take away from the opportunities we hope to
provide, and our team knows this cannot happen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>            As much as we hope for donations, we
understand that not everyone is able to contribute. However if you’re as
passionate about this as we are, you can help spread the word about Camp
Connected! Mention what Camp Connected is doing to a few friends and how their
help can really impact this camp and the participants in it. Also by using the
Indiegogo share tools, you can help spread the word virtually! </p>

<b>What are Handicapped Lifts from Coach Lift®?</b> <br/><br/>Lifts from 
Coach Lift® are chairs that rise on a lift tube, and swing around to the
 door. The user sits comfortably, 	pushes the control button, rises 
slowly, and swivels the chair into the door opening, where he or she can
 transfer into the 	vehicle. It's a simple concept, but one that can 
change your life. A Handicapped Lift from Coach Lift® is engineered for 
durability 	and ease of use. Installation requires a minimum of 
modification to your vehicle, making it an extremely economical

<p><b>How Does a Coach Lift® Work?</b></p>
<p>		The Coach Lift® is 
installed next to the door of your RV or inside the door of your van. 		
Only minor modifications to your vehicle are required in most cases. It 
is operated by a 12 volt DC motor that 		is powered by the vehicle's 
battery. The chair and swing arm bracket are removed quickly and easily 
for storage 		during travel.	 </p>
<p>		The double hinged design of the 
swing arm bracket allows the durable aluminum chair to turn to any angle
 for 		easy loading. The lift is operated with a hand held remote cable 
pendant switch. The chair rises gently 		to the desired level where it 
can be swiveled into the door. To exit the vehicle, the rider sits in 
the chair, 		the chair is swiveled away from the door, and the control 
switch is pushed causing the chair to descend.</p>

To give back to our Veterans in need. Wounded, disabled, and injured veterans that are having difficulty with their mobility should be provided their freedom again. Mobility lifts for vehicles are expensive to make, and expensive to install. Our goal is to give away as many lifts as we can to those in need! WE GET MANY REQUESTS FOR HELP FROM OUR MOST HONORABLE TROOPS. We would love to tour the country and give away one lift in each state - one in each city - one to every veteran who needs one! But we are limited by our funds. We need your help. Each time we receive enough money to give away a lift, we can provide it to a much needed veteran.
HELP AND HONOR OUR VETS, THEY DESERVE IT:

What are Handicapped Lifts from Coach Lift®? Lifts from 
Coach Lift® are chairs that rise on a lift tube, and swing around to the
 door. The user sits comfortably, 	pushes the control button, rises 
slowly, and swivels the chair into the door opening, where he or she can
 transfer into the 	vehicle. It's a simple concept, but one that can 
change your life. A Handicapped Lift from Coach Lift® is engineered for 
durability 	and ease of use. Installation requires a minimum of 
modification to your vehicle, making it an extremely economical 
solution.



Real Life Examples:	Jean loves the RV lifestyle. She and 
her husband, Jim, have seen a lot of this beautiful country during the 
10 years since 	his retirement. They have made lasting friendships with 
many other RV'ers along the way, and have no desire to settle down 	just
 yet. But Jean's arthritis is making it increasingly difficult for her to get into and out of the RV. 	 
	Robert depends on the income from his job as a long haul trucker. It's 
the only life he's known for the last 22 years. But when 	a stroke that 
severely weakened his left side left him unable to climb into the cab of his truck,

scaled-down future on the income his disability pension would provide.

<p><b>The goal of this campaign is to enable my daughter and me to <i>permanently</i> break free of illness, allowing us to lead long, healthy, happy, and productive lives!</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My adult life is defined by a constant struggle against mucous, infection, and serious digestive issues.  I have been too sick to work steadily since 2009.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Several weeks ago Malaika went to the ER wheezing for breath, her lungs congested, still to this day.  I don't want her having permanent lung problems, but I am too sick to help her.</p>

<h3 id=""goal1"">Goal 1 – “Immediate Surgery” (+$9,800)</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>While nose/sinus surgery is covered by Canadian medical, wait times for a public Operating Room are estimated at 1½ to 2 years.  My goal is to rent a private Operating Room to receive surgery before my body gives out.</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I recently located the top sinus specialist in western Canada, <a href=""http://www.drjaver.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr. Amin Javer</a>, who does leading sinus <a href=""http://www.drjaver.com/publications/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">research</a>, <a href=""http://www.drjaver.com/courses/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">training</a>, and <a href=""http://www.drjaver.com/learning/image-guided-sinus-surgery-cass/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">surgery</a>.  During consultation with him, my CT scan revealed a badly broken nose from childhood that restricts airflow to my sinuses — surgery will likely help me break free from constant infection!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dr. Javer's public practise is no longer taking patients because of a lack of public Operating Room time.  His wait list had reached five years.  I could get a referral to another public surgeon with a shorter wait list, but it would still take years, and things have become critically bad: I am currently bedridden, have worsening heat-stroke symptoms, and my throat is swelling shut.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Booking an Operating Room at the private <a href=""http://www.falsecreekhealthcare.com/services/surgical-centre/ent/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">False Creek Healthcare Centre</a> will cost $8,500 for 2.5 hours.  This will allow immediate surgery by Dr. Javer, after the prerequisite week of taking antibiotics.  Surgery would be performed by a world-class sinus surgeon using state-of-the-art surgical equipment, offering me the best chance of making a full recovery from my illness.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I will also need to stay in a clean and very cold air conditioned hotel room before and after the surgery, to combat my infection, overheating, and Environmental Sensitivities.  It is pretty much impossible to overcome chronic infection in a home that is super humid and 24 to 30+ C (75 to 86+ F) for sixteen hours a day!</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id=""goal2"">Goal 2 – “A Breath Of Fresh Air” (+$10,500)</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>As a result of her <b><i>Environmental Sensitivities, </i></b>Malaika is currently suffering from lung problems.  We both need high-end air purifiers to avoid chronic illness.</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After weeks researching air purifiers, I decided on a company called <a href=""http://www.allerair.com/about.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AllerAir</a> which produces a line of air purifiers specifically designed for people with extreme Multiple Chemical Sensitivities (MCS).  The company was founded by someone with a close family member suffering from MCS.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The AllerAir AirMedic+ line of air purifiers are made entirely from inert materials that can not off-gas.  They use metal housing and contain no plastic or styrofoam, and the motor is fully sealed to prevent any odours from escaping.  They even provide several different carbon blends to test in advance, allowing you to choose the specific blend that bothers your sensitivities the least.  Their filters capture particles far tinier than a standard HEPA filter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The goal is to purchase 2 air purifiers for my place and 2 for Malaika's mom's place, as well as a set of replacement filters and parts, assuring us both years of clean and breathable air!</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>A variety of purchases to help me <b><i>fight infection and </i></b>regain my health post-surgery, as well as expenses aimed at helping Malaika avoid a life of chronic illness.</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After a decade fighting infection, I have discovered many things which boost my health, but unfortunately most of them are expensive, hard to find, or exhausting to prepare.  My illness leaves me underemployed, which means I can't buy the things I need to get better!</p>

<h1 id=""why-contribute"">Why contribute?</h1>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id=""why-adventures"">Join us on our adventures through life!</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If it weren't for my illness, I would be actively showing Malaika the world — going new places, trying new things, tasting new foods, adventuring in nature, and meeting new people!  I would love for you to share in our experiences!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id=""why-malaika"">Help me become part of my daughter's life again!</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For over three months I have been too sick to see my daughter most days.  I am missing her terribly, and she misses me.  <i>I need to break free from infection so I can have her back in my life!</i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id=""why-unique"">Save a unique and creative mind</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I was born with an unusual brain that lacks several basic abilities.  Many things that other people do automatically or easily, take me enormous conscious effort, if I can do them at all.  I have never allowed these limitations to define me, leading me to come up with very non-standard methods for problem solving and learning.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>My mind is bursting with solutions to a wide variety of problems, but all my daily energy goes to fighting infection; I would love to be healthy enough to share my ideas with the world!</i></b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id=""why-suffering"">End a decade of suffering</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Instead of working on my life goals, most of my daily energy goes into battling endless infection, struggling just to stay alive.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I wouldn't wish my condition on my worst enemy.  I don't think anyone deserves to spend thousands of hours enduring excruciating abdominal cramping and sinus pain, coughing up infected mucous, starving from long-term digestive issues, and pervasive fatigue that isn't helped with sleep.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id=""why-medical"">Provide medical relief</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I have sought medical help for my condition for more than a decade, but despite seeing an endless stream of doctors, ENTs, specialists, and Emergency Rooms, not one doctor ever looked at my sinuses with a camera scope, or suggested I try doing anything at all.  I have been left to solve my medical problems on my own, or die.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I recently had a private and rather expensive 30 minute consultation with a sinus expert, and finally received practical medical care!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I find it sad that the only way for many Canadians to receive decent medical care is by paying out-of-pocket.  <i>There are more than just cracks in Canada's medical system that people slip through... there are giant gaping holes swallowing people alive!</i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id=""why-poverty"">Enable me to break free from poverty</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My illness has kept me from steady employment for several years.  I first lived off savings, then government assistance.  In November 2013, I was deemed ineligible to receive further government assistance ""because I live with someone who helps take care of my daughter"", and was kicked off, left struggling to pay the rent and to afford food.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I have known for many years what medical equipment and health products I need, but poverty has kept them from me.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I am currently in the process of receiving money from a family land sale, but it won't be nearly enough to cover all costs related to recovering my health and protecting my daughter's health.  The land sale money will be spent on living expenses while recovering my health, and costs related to getting back to work (a computer, a printer, Internet, video editing equipment, work clothes, and so on).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id=""why-landlord"">Help me escape landlord abuse</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After moving to my current rental suite a year ago with Malaika and her mom, our landlords began breaking every law in the book and making our lives hell.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">They prevent us from doing our laundry; prevent our daughter from using the back yard; let their pitbull terrorise our guests and cat; no lock on one of our doors; no usable heating system during the winter; harassment and intimidation; and a lot more.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I have been far too sick to move or file a case against them.</p>

<h3 id=""faq-contributions"">Making a contribution</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<b>How do I make a contribution?</b><br/><b>1.</b> Click on the box for the Perk level you want, found near the top of the page on the right side.<br/><b>2.</b> On the next page, confirm how much you are contributing.  You can contribute more money than the Perk level costs, if you want.</li>
<b>3.</b> For Perk levels of $100 and above, enter your shipping information for the mailed-out Perks.<br/><b>4.</b> On the next page, you can choose to pay directly through IndieGoGo, or through PayPal.  See the next question for more details.<br/><br/><li>
<b>What's the difference between paying with credit card or PayPal?</b><br/>
      To use PayPal, you will be taken to the PayPal web site where you can pay via credit card or PayPal balance, and <i>I will receive your contribution immediately!</i>  You do not need a PayPal account, just a credit card.<br/>
      To use IndieGoGo, enter your credit card info and IndieGoGo will bill you immediately, but I will only receive the funds once the campaign has finished.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Can I make a contribution on behalf of a friend?</b><br/>
      Yep!  <a href=""http://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526866-How-to-Contribute-for-a-Friend"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">More information</a>.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Can I pool contributions with friends to get a better Perk?</b><br/>
      Sure!  You may divide Perks between one person for every $250 contributed.  For example, a contribution of $1,000 may be divided among 4 different people.  You must provide the names and contact info for each person, and let me know how you want the Perks to be divided.  Please <a href=""http://alieninsight.org/contact/#table"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact me directly</a> before making a pooled contribution.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>I made a mistake, can I get my money back?</b><br/>
      Indiegogo <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/about/terms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Terms of Use</a> state that all contributions are final and non-refundable (<a href=""http://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526876-Refunds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">more information</a>).  That said, I am personally willing to refund any contribution of $10 or more via PayPal, and any contribution of $100 or more via other means (money order, Western Union, wire transfer, etc.), minus any fees.  Refunds can be requested at latest 2 days after the campaign ends.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Can I contribute anonymously?</b><br/>
      Sort of.  You can withhold your name and/or the amount you contributed <i>from the public</i>, but I will still see your name and contribution amount.  This is necessary for Perks to be fulfilled. After clicking on your Perk, make sure to check the box that says ""[x] Don't display my name on the campaign page"" (<a href=""http://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526856-How-to-Contribute-Anonymously"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">more information</a>).  If you want to remain completely anonymous, you could send me a donation via BitCoin or cash.  See next question.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Are there other ways I can send you funds?</b><br/>
      Sure!  If the campaign has already ended or you don't want to use IndieGoGo for any reason, you can use <a href=""http://alieninsight.org/send_money/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PayPal</a>, <a href=""http://alieninsight.org/send_money/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BitCoin</a>, <a href=""http://alieninsight.org/contact/#table"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">postal mail</a> (cash, money orders, treasure chests full of gold, ect.), or <a href=""http://alieninsight.org/contact/#table"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact me directly</a> to arrange anything else (Vancity transfer, Western Union, etc.).<br/><br/><a href=""http://alieninsight.org/send_money/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/757020/files/20140731103844-Send_Funds_PayPal.png?1406828324"" src="""" style=""""/></a><a href=""http://alieninsight.org/contact/#table"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/757027/files/20140731104005-Send_Funds_Vancity_Western_Union.png?1406828405"" src="""" style=""""/></a><br/><a href=""http://alieninsight.org/send_money/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/757034/files/20140731104112-Send_Funds_BitCoin.png?1406828472"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 34px;""/></a><a href=""http://alieninsight.org/contact/#table"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/757035/files/20140731104132-Send_Funds_Cash_Cheque_Treasure.png?1406828492"" src="""" style=""""/></a><br/><br/>

<h3 id=""faq-perks"">Receiving Perks</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<b>What are Perks?</b><br/>
      Perks are a way to reward you for your financial contribution.  My goal is to make this campaign more than just a fundraiser, <i>I want you to be completely happy that you helped out!</i>  I have tried to come up with some compelling Perks, and I hope you enjoy them.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Are there any additional shipping charges?</b><br/>
      No!  All Perks already include worldwide shipping.<br/><br/>

<p><br/></p>
<h3 id=""faq-background"">Background information</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Where are you from?</b><br/>
      I was born near the village of <a href=""http://www.portclements.ca/village-office/visitor-information/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Port Clements</a> on the island chain of <a href=""http://www.gohaidagwaii.ca/our-islands"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Haida Gwaii</a> (also formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands), the ancestral home of the <a href=""http://www.gohaidagwaii.ca/our-islands/cultural-history"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Haida people</a>, located off the north-western coast of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">British Columbia</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Canada</a>.  I moved to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Vancouver"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vancouver</a> when I was seven years old, and have since lived in many places around BC.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Is ""Raven"" your real name?</b><br/>
      Yes!  My parents went with the name because there was an actual raven flying around the meadow outside the log cabin where I was born.  My birth name was Raven Morris, and I have been going by Raven Singularity for the past couple years.  I want to legally change my name, but have been too sick to obtain the required documentation.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>What medical conditions are you dealing with?</b><br/>
      My medical condition is complex, with many interrelated issues and symptoms.  I have been formerly diagnosed as having <i>Chronic Rhinosinusitis</i> (sinus infection) and <i>Environmental Sensitivities (ES)</i>, but despite this I have been unable to find any public medical help for years on end.  I am no longer strong enough to keep seeking public medical help at this point, so I have turned to private medical help, which has been fast and effective.  My 30 minute private consultation with a sinus expert was more beneficial than the previous 15 years of seeking public medical help!  It was the best $500 I have ever spent.  The sinus expert reviewed my CT scan and did an examination and reported that I have a severely deviated septum (broken nose from early childhood that I didn't know about), major sinus blockage, sinus infection, presence of sticky mucous, sinus inflammation, and other sinus issues (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/raven.singularity/posts/502600769876141"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">read the medical details on my Facebook</a>).<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>What is your current living arrangement and financial situation?</b><br/>
      Several months before our daughter was born, <a href=""http://www.haislacollins.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Haisla Collins</a> (Malaika's mother) and I had already separated.  A couple months after Malaika's birth, we moved in together as roommates, so that we would both have access to our daughter.  In November 2013 I was cut off Income Assistance because of living with someone that helps care for my daughter.  We were not in a relationship and did not meet the government's criteria for marriage-like/commonlaw, it was strictly because I lived at the same address as someone assisting Malaika.  They would not even allow me to remove Malaika from my file and only receive assistance for myself.  For the next half-year the three of us continued to live together, with me sick and struggling to come up with monthly rent, and not having money to feed myself.  Haisla moved out a month ago, with Malaika.  The house I am renting from was sold shortly after Haisla moved out, and I must be out by the end of August 2014.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Can't you receive Income Assistance if you're living alone now?</b><br/>
      A couple months ago I received the first portion of money from a family land sale, and I am living off the final bit of this right now.  The money is not considered ""income"", however people are not eligible for Income Assistance if they have any savings.  People on disability assistance <i>are</i> permitted to have savings, but my application for disability was silently denied, despite including a documented diagnosis of Environmental Sensitivities, which is a recognised disability in Canada.  Filing for disability is a complex process, and I am currently far too sick to manage a second application.  I am in the process of filing my taxes in order to receive the final portion of land sale money, which I will use while recovering from my illness (for expenses related to rent, living, moving, medical needs, getting back to work, and paying off any income tax from this campaign).<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>If you have Environmental Sensitivities, why do you live with a long-haired cat?</b><br/>
      For most of my life I did not react to most things found in nature, including animal dander, trees, flowers, pollen, and even cut grass.  During the last year I have become steadily more sensitive, and now I react strongly to all of these things.  Sitsa is being cared for by someone else the past couple months, as I'm too sick right now.  I hope to recover from surgery, get the air purifiers, and get Sitsa back!<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Wouldn't it be cheaper to buy an air conditioner than stay in a hotel?</b><br/>
      Air conditioners usually have poor air filters, or none at all, causing them to put out large amounts of particulate matter.  This burns my throat within minutes and quickly becomes unbearable.  Most hotels have air conditioners with decent air filters that are changed regularly, and I would be able to check this out before renting a room.<br/><br/>

Greetings. My name is Raven, and this is my wonderful baby daughter, Malaika.  Thanks for checking out our campaign.  My daughter and I suffer from severe Environmental Sensitivities, which causes chronic illness.
The goal of this campaign is to enable my daughter and me to permanently break free of illness, allowing us to lead long, healthy, happy, and productive lives!
My adult life is defined by a constant struggle against mucous, infection, and serious digestive issues.  I have been too sick to work steadily since 2009.
The past four months have been the most difficult of my life — I am bedridden most of the day, can't take care of my daughter, and can't even take care of myself.  Without significant changes I am nearing the end of my life.
Several weeks ago Malaika went to the ER wheezing for breath, her lungs congested, still to this day.  I don't want her having permanent lung problems, but I am too sick to help her.
If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.  I promise to not simply disappear when the campaign is over!

Goals of the campaign



Goal 1 – “Immediate Surgery” (+$9,800)
While nose/sinus surgery is covered by Canadian medical, wait times for a public Operating Room are estimated at 1½ to 2 years.  My goal is to rent a private Operating Room to receive surgery before my body gives out.
I recently located the top sinus specialist in western Canada, Dr. Amin Javer, who does leading sinus research, training, and surgery.  During consultation with him, my CT scan revealed a badly broken nose from childhood that restricts airflow to my sinuses — surgery will likely help me break free from constant infection!
Dr. Javer's public practise is no longer taking patients because of a lack of public Operating Room time.  His wait list had reached five years.  I could get a referral to another public surgeon with a shorter wait list, but it would still take years, and things have become critically bad: I am currently bedridden, have worsening heat-stroke symptoms, and my throat is swelling shut.
Booking an Operating Room at the private False Creek Healthcare Centre will cost $8,500 for 2.5 hours.  This will allow immediate surgery by Dr. Javer, after the prerequisite week of taking antibiotics.  Surgery would be performed by a world-class sinus surgeon using state-of-the-art surgical equipment, offering me the best chance of making a full recovery from my illness.
I will also need to stay in a clean and very cold air conditioned hotel room before and after the surgery, to combat my infection, overheating, and Environmental Sensitivities.  It is pretty much impossible to overcome chronic infection in a home that is super humid and 24 to 30+ C (75 to 86+ F) for sixteen hours a day!

Goal 2 – “A Breath Of Fresh Air” (+$10,500)
As a result of her Environmental Sensitivities, Malaika is currently suffering from lung problems.  We both need high-end air purifiers to avoid chronic illness.
After weeks researching air purifiers, I decided on a company called AllerAir which produces a line of air purifiers specifically designed for people with extreme Multiple Chemical Sensitivities (MCS).  The company was founded by someone with a close family member suffering from MCS.
The AllerAir AirMedic+ line of air purifiers are made entirely from inert materials that can not off-gas.  They use metal housing and contain no plastic or styrofoam, and the motor is fully sealed to prevent any odours from escaping.  They even provide several different carbon blends to test in advance, allowing you to choose the specific blend that bothers your sensitivities the least.  Their filters capture particles far tinier than a standard HEPA filter.
The goal is to purchase 2 air purifiers for my place and 2 for Malaika's mom's place, as well as a set of replacement filters and parts, assuring us both years of clean and breathable air!

Goal 3 – “Regaining Health Fund” (+$5,000)
A variety of purchases to help me fight infection and regain my health post-surgery, as well as expenses aimed at helping Malaika avoid a life of chronic illness.
After a decade fighting infection, I have discovered many things which boost my health, but unfortunately most of them are expensive, hard to find, or exhausting to prepare.  My illness leaves me underemployed, which means I can't buy the things I need to get better!
Health costs include purchases such as:

Health supplements (enzymes, colloidal silver, Himalayan rock salt, medical-grade Manuka honey, probiotics)

Health foods (local berries/fruits/vegetables, raw nuts, raw coconut oil, whole and fresh spices, some rare foods, seed sprouting kit, herb garden)

Medications (public medical doesn't always cover prescriptions, such as antibiotics)

Water delivery (I must drink 4 to 14 litres [1 to 3½ US gallons] of water daily when fighting infection, and can't stomach most tap water)

Bicycles and outdoor gear (second-hand bikes, bike repairs, child-carrier, helmets, lights, reflectors, footwear)

Taxi costs (when I'm too sick to bicycle or take public transit)

Kitchen supplies (basic kitchenware, food prep supplies, juicer, blender, storage jars)

Home cleaning supplies (mops, brushes, cloths, buckets, non-toxic cleaners)

Why contribute?

Join us on our adventures through life!
If it weren't for my illness, I would be actively showing Malaika the world — going new places, trying new things, tasting new foods, adventuring in nature, and meeting new people!  I would love for you to share in our experiences!

Help me become part of my daughter's life again!
For over three months I have been too sick to see my daughter most days.  I am missing her terribly, and she misses me.  I need to break free from infection so I can have her back in my life!

Save a unique and creative mind
I was born with an unusual brain that lacks several basic abilities.  Many things that other people do automatically or easily, take me enormous conscious effort, if I can do them at all.  I have never allowed these limitations to define me, leading me to come up with very non-standard methods for problem solving and learning.
My mind is bursting with solutions to a wide variety of problems, but all my daily energy goes to fighting infection; I would love to be healthy enough to share my ideas with the world!

End a decade of suffering
Instead of working on my life goals, most of my daily energy goes into battling endless infection, struggling just to stay alive.
I wouldn't wish my condition on my worst enemy.  I don't think anyone deserves to spend thousands of hours enduring excruciating abdominal cramping and sinus pain, coughing up infected mucous, starving from long-term digestive issues, and pervasive fatigue that isn't helped with sleep.

Provide medical relief
I have sought medical help for my condition for more than a decade, but despite seeing an endless stream of doctors, ENTs, specialists, and Emergency Rooms, not one doctor ever looked at my sinuses with a camera scope, or suggested I try doing anything at all.  I have been left to solve my medical problems on my own, or die.
I recently had a private and rather expensive 30 minute consultation with a sinus expert, and finally received practical medical care!
I find it sad that the only way for many Canadians to receive decent medical care is by paying out-of-pocket.  There are more than just cracks in Canada's medical system that people slip through... there are giant gaping holes swallowing people alive!

Enable me to break free from poverty
My illness has kept me from steady employment for several years.  I first lived off savings, then government assistance.  In November 2013, I was deemed ineligible to receive further government assistance ""because I live with someone who helps take care of my daughter"", and was kicked off, left struggling to pay the rent and to afford food.
I have known for many years what medical equipment and health products I need, but poverty has kept them from me.
I am currently in the process of receiving money from a family land sale, but it won't be nearly enough to cover all costs related to recovering my health and protecting my daughter's health.  The land sale money will be spent on living expenses while recovering my health, and costs related to getting back to work (a computer, a printer, Internet, video editing equipment, work clothes, and so on).

Help me escape landlord abuse
After moving to my current rental suite a year ago with Malaika and her mom, our landlords began breaking every law in the book and making our lives hell.
They prevent us from doing our laundry; prevent our daughter from using the back yard; let their pitbull terrorise our guests and cat; no lock on one of our doors; no usable heating system during the winter; harassment and intimidation; and a lot more.
I have been far too sick to move or file a case against them.

Background information


Where are you from?
      I was born near the village of Port Clements on the island chain of Haida Gwaii (also formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands), the ancestral home of the Haida people, located off the north-western coast of British Columbia, Canada.  I moved to Vancouver when I was seven years old, and have since lived in many places around BC.


Is ""Raven"" your real name?
      Yes!  My parents went with the name because there was an actual raven flying around the meadow outside the log cabin where I was born.  My birth name was Raven Morris, and I have been going by Raven Singularity for the past couple years.  I want to legally change my name, but have been too sick to obtain the required documentation.


What medical conditions are you dealing with?
      My medical condition is complex, with many interrelated issues and symptoms.  I have been formerly diagnosed as having Chronic Rhinosinusitis (sinus infection) and Environmental Sensitivities (ES), but despite this I have been unable to find any public medical help for years on end.  I am no longer strong enough to keep seeking public medical help at this point, so I have turned to private medical help, which has been fast and effective.  My 30 minute private consultation with a sinus expert was more beneficial than the previous 15 years of seeking public medical help!  It was the best $500 I have ever spent.  The sinus expert reviewed my CT scan and did an examination and reported that I have a severely deviated septum (broken nose from early childhood that I didn't know about), major sinus blockage, sinus infection, presence of sticky mucous, sinus inflammation, and other sinus issues (read the medical details on my Facebook).


What is your current living arrangement and financial situation?
      Several months before our daughter was born, Haisla Collins (Malaika's mother) and I had already separated.  A couple months after Malaika's birth, we moved in together as roommates, so that we would both have access to our daughter.  In November 2013 I was cut off Income Assistance because of living with someone that helps care for my daughter.  We were not in a relationship and did not meet the government's criteria for marriage-like/commonlaw, it was strictly because I lived at the same address as someone assisting Malaika.  They would not even allow me to remove Malaika from my file and only receive assistance for myself.  For the next half-year the three of us continued to live together, with me sick and struggling to come up with monthly rent, and not having money to feed myself.  Haisla moved out a month ago, with Malaika.  The house I am renting from was sold shortly after Haisla moved out, and I must be out by the end of August 2014.


Can't you receive Income Assistance if you're living alone now?
      A couple months ago I received the first portion of money from a family land sale, and I am living off the final bit of this right now.  The money is not considered ""income"", however people are not eligible for Income Assistance if they have any savings.  People on disability assistance are permitted to have savings, but my application for disability was silently denied, despite including a documented diagnosis of Environmental Sensitivities, which is a recognised disability in Canada.  Filing for disability is a complex process, and I am currently far too sick to manage a second application.  I am in the process of filing my taxes in order to receive the final portion of land sale money, which I will use while recovering from my illness (for expenses related to rent, living, moving, medical needs, getting back to work, and paying off any income tax from this campaign).


If you have Environmental Sensitivities, why do you live with a long-haired cat?
      For most of my life I did not react to most things found in nature, including animal dander, trees, flowers, pollen, and even cut grass.  During the last year I have become steadily more sensitive, and now I react strongly to all of these things.  Sitsa is being cared for by someone else the past couple months, as I'm too sick right now.  I hope to recover from surgery, get the air purifiers, and get Sitsa back!


Wouldn't it be cheaper to buy an air conditioner than stay in a hotel?
      Air conditioners usually have poor air filters, or none at all, causing them to put out large amounts of particulate matter.  This burns my throat within minutes and quickly becomes unbearable.  Most hotels have air conditioners with decent air filters that are changed regularly, and I would be able to check this out before renting a room.

If you know me or Malaika in real life, you can show your support by joining the campaign Team as a ""Supporter"", which means your name, photo, and Facebook icon will shown up at the bottom of the page.  Please contact me for instructions!

Help pick up some things for me
I don't usually have the energy to leave the house, so it would be greatly appreciated if anybody could pick up any of the items below, and drop them off for me in north Burnaby!
If you contact me before you buy something, I can take it off the list.  I can pay in cash ($20s) or Vancity transfer (if you have an account).


Pharmacy items: Epsom bathing salts, large cloth adhesive bandages, mouth thermometer, tape measure (this kind), nasal irrigation aid (neti-pot), Gaviscon mint flavoured antacid liquid


Roots/herbs: Oregon grape root, goldenseal root, Angelica root, licorice root, pleuisy root, lemongrass root, lemon verbena leaves, lemon balm leaves, mint leaves, euphrasia/eyebright leaves, stevia leaves, elder flower, chamomile flower, Echinacea, yarrow, catnip. (Note: looking for fresh or dried, minimally processed; do not want tinctures, extracts, pills, or oils please)


Spices/nutrition: Himalayan/pink rock salt (whole chunks or ground, no additives), whole nutmeg, whole cloves, green cardamom pods, black cardamom pods, ajwain/carom pods, coriander seeds, mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, dried bay leaves, dried curry leaves, dried fenugreek leaves, red chili powder, ground asafetida, ground ginger, ground paprika. (Note: looking for intensely flavoured spices, such as what you find at the Indian shops south of 41st and Fraser; do not want prepackaged)


Appliances/kitchen: Sprouter with bag of alfalfa or other mild sprouting seeds, dehumidifier (confirm price), NutriBullet or MagicBullet blender, juicer (confirm price), cheesecloth, kitchen scale, one or two 2nd-hand coffee grinders with low blades suitable for grinding spices, 6 to 12 regular-mouth 1-litre Mason jars with lids

Bicycle accessories: Blinking red light, large pack of AAA batteries, rear panniers with rack (confirm price first)

Help drive me to appointments/errands
I could use a lift to my appointments and running my errands.  I'm often too sick to take the bus, and taxis are not affordable.  Things like grocery shopping can leave me exhausted for days after.  I would be happy to pay for gas or buy you lunch as thanks!  Please contact me if you can help out.

Help me with moving preparations
The house where I'm staying has been sold, and I need to be moved out by the end of the month (August 2014).  I'm mostly bedridden and could greatly use a hand with finding a new place, packing, cleaning, recycling, garbage disposal, and moving.  If you might be able to help with any of these, please contact me directly!

incomplete? Have you ever wondered how things could be different, especially
for those who are struggling just to make ends meet? Are you inspired by the
idea of health care as a holistic, community endeavor? If you’ve answered yes
to these questions, then we invite you to join us on our journey to develop our
skills, so we can help bring healing and health justice to others.<br/><br/><p></p><p><b>Our vision</b></p>
<p>Mary and Nathan dream of developing a community based,
wellness center that operates on the principle of whole person health (body,
mind, and spirit), and primarily serves individuals and communities that
experience social and/or economic barriers under the current system. We aim to
create an environment that in, and of itself, fosters wellbeing and healing. Our
desire is to uphold traditional medicines and wisdom, while also exploring ways
elements of modern, science based medicine can provide additional support. We
also seek to create a model that breaks down the traditional top-down hierarchy
between health care practitioners and patients, and which also utilizes the
arts (writing, photography, painting, etc.) and community building (amongst
patients and beyond immediate patients) as key components of healing. In
addition, we see the center as a potential hub for health care activism, both
in terms of advocating for needed reforms to the current mainstream health care
system, as well as providing models for systemic change and transformation. </p>
<p><b>Our Plan</b></p>
<p>Mary and Nathan are both in a period of refining the skills we have, and developing additional skills needed to birth the vision. Nathan
is in the process of learning the art of leading meditation and classes exploring
the wisdom of the Zen tradition. He also is developing an <a href=""http://www.ngtherbals.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">herbal medicine business</a> and practice, and plans on undergoing additional herbalist training in the coming
years to deepen his understanding of the plants, and expand his ability to
utilize their healing capacities. Mary is in the process of strengthening her clinical skills in a health care setting, and also is exploring how a clinic operates and functions
under the current system. She plans on returning to school in the coming year
or two to get a Masters in Nurse Practitioner degree, and following that, a
Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine. </p>
<p><b>What we need help with now</b></p>
<p>In addition to our longer term learning plans, Mary and
Nathan intend to attend conferences and workshops that target specific areas of growth
and development. The Buddhist Peace Fellowship’s upcoming <a href=""http://www.buddhistpeacefellowship.org/gathering/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Conference</a> at
the end of August is one such event. We see the conference as an opportunity
for us to do the following: <br/></p><p>explore and practice applying spiritual wisdom to
service and activist work, <br/></p><p>network with others on similar paths, <br/></p><p>and share
our vision with folks from across the U.S. <br/></p><p>In addition, Nathan will be
co-leading a yoga, movement and meditation session at the conference with
Oakland based Buddhist teacher <a href=""http://www.buddhistpeacefellowship.org/tss-2014/mushim-ikeda/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mushim Patricia Ikeda</a>. So any financial gift to
this campaign will also support the gift of this class to the approximately 120 people that will be in attendance
at the conference. </p>
<p><b>Our Financial Goal</b></p>
<p>Our goal is $1,000 for this campaign, which will cover our round
trip airfare and car rental costs. If we receive gifts beyond the
target goal, they will initially go towards lodging, and to offset the conference fees we
already paid. <br/></p><p>Beyond immediate expenses for the Conference, any additional gifts will allow us to start shifting more of our financial resources towards the next steps in our long term plan. <br/></p><p>The campaign has multiple gift levels listed, but we invite you to give at whatever level you can. Every donation helps! <br/></p>
<p><b>Other ways you can help with the campaign </b></p>
<p>In addition to financial contributions, we need help spreading
the word about the campaign. If you know either of us, or both of us, offering
personalized appeals to your circle of friends and family would be greatly
appreciated. We intend to give periodic updates during the campaign, so sharing
those updates in your circles also would support us. </p>
<p>Beyond our campaign, we’d love it if interested supporters
also spread the word about the good work of the <a href=""http://www.buddhistpeacefellowship.org/about-bpf/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Buddhist Peace Fellowship</a>.
Their website is filled with thoughtful and compelling writing from a diverse
group of authors, including some of Nathan’s writing. In addition, the
Fellowship is developing programs like this conference to support activists,
peace-workers, and people in service who seek to integrate their spiritual
practice into the work they do in the world. </p><p><b>Learn More</b></p><p>Nathan recently gave a talk at his Zen community about health and illness, birth and death, where he explored the relationship between holistic health and spiritual practices. Included is a short meditation reflecting on how we respond to commonplace illnesses and pain in our daily lives, as well as conversation about the intersection of personal health with social conditions.

Beyond our campaign, we’d love it if interested supporters
also spread the word about the good work of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship.
Their website is filled with thoughtful and compelling writing from a diverse
group of authors, including some of Nathan’s writing. In addition, the
Fellowship is developing programs like this conference to support activists,
peace-workers, and people in service who seek to integrate their spiritual
practice into the work they do in the world. Learn MoreNathan recently gave a talk at his Zen community about health and illness, birth and death, where he explored the relationship between holistic health and spiritual practices. Included is a short meditation reflecting on how we respond to commonplace illnesses and pain in our daily lives, as well as conversation about the intersection of personal health with social conditions. You can download the talk here.Thank YouThank you for taking the time to learn more about our vision, and for supporting us take a step along the path.

<h3>Helping With Shane Elliott's Surgery cost</h3>
<p>I have Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber (KTW) syndrome. KTW is a blood vessel and lymphatic overgrowth disorder that caused me to lost my leg.  I've been undergoing surgeries through out my entire life and and coming near the end of my journey and medical struggles. At the end of July on the 31st I'm getting what may be the last or second to last debulking surgery to help me with my disease.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The reason why i'm making this campaign is because I can't afford to do this completely on my own and out of pocket this year.  I've had these surgeries in the past and have been able to fund it all on my own.  This year I've had some unexpected problems including losing my disability checks and car breaking down.  I live alone, work 40+ hours a week, and am a full time student still at SELU.  With all of these challenges I just can't pull off the expenses this year.  My mother and father are able to pay for my plane tickets but I may not be able to handle the rest of the expenses.  <br/><br/>Here is a break down of how much money I need and what I need them for and how the money will be used.<br/><br/>$313 is still owed to one of the specialist from last year that I never received the bill from.</p>
<p>$500-625 will be my hotel cost for the medical purpose hotel that is across the street from the St. Roosevelt hospital in Manhattan.</p>
<p>$800-900 will be in left over cost because my medicare/medicaid doesn't cover all of the cost, some parts medicaid doesn't cover at all and medicare only does about %80 of the total cost. </p>
<p>$50-125 in cab fees in NYC cost between the airport, hotel, and pharmacy</p>
<p>$50 in food cost while being there for 5 days.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Before my first surgery with Dr. Levitin in NYC I could barely walk and was coming close to being kicked out of college.  Now I'm nearing the end of my college career with only 7 classes left and can even run and swim again.  With continued treatment I will be able to live a more normal life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What will happen with excess and left over money?</h3>
<p>I plan to donate any extra money to the KT foundation for other persons with this disease.  I even plan to document every penny that I spend in NYC to show all the people that help me exactly what their money goes to and so that everyone can be assured that the exact total of left over funds will be donated to charity. </p>

But recently there are waterbikes mostly with dolphin and swan shapes which are not the most suitable ones for this.
So we teamed up to combine our talents and create something really new. Both of us has a lifelong devotion towards water and to walk the red brick road instead of the good old yellow one.

Project Hydrocumbent

We would like to finish a race water bike that’s breathtaking both in design and drive. We named it the ’Hydrocumbent’ built from the words water and the recumbent bike.
The race water bike takes a well-known but till now technically stagnating leisure time activity to a new level. With our model everyone –from the age of 9 to 99- can spend more time on water, organize comfy excursions, or push the pedal to the max, by reaching an average 15-18 km/h with bare calves.


Why we need you

We have a race water bike prototype planned with the students of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics and developed with a Hungarian ship manufacturer.

Till this moment we injected only private funds into this project and with our passion for this whole initiative and despite all hardships we managed to have this beautiful prototype designed and developed. 
But as most trailblazers we also stepped onto unbeaten track and need financial encouragement to finally succeed.
With your generous help we will be able to get from the prototype to a mass production model, test it and and step into the spotlight be it either international water sports exhibitions or lakeside and beach rentals.


Your generosity our gratitude

As we already raised curiosity within and beyond our borders that’s why we have to get from B to C. in completing our dream.
We calculated to collect 40 000 Euros to be able to finalize a mass production model build another one and take them to a wider audience in order to spread the bike.How will this amount be spent? What are the milestones? 

First we have to put our experiences and learnings gained through the prototype testing into practice by finalizing the technical details of the mass production model.

Then we finalize the mass production model and manufacture another model to be able to present them together everywhere.If we are ready with that we will have to contact and negotiate with future investors, customers in Hungary and foreign countries, as far as possible appearing at international exhibitions, water sport shows in Europe, Asia and the United States depending on costs.

When we reach our financial goal we will launch a marketing campaign by finalizing our website, producing sales materials and advertising the project first online.

Your unique perks with which we will express our gratitude for believing in our project will range from your personal signature printed on the first mass production model, or named after you to inviting you to Hungary for a free ride on one of the race water bike or discount from the selling-price. 

If we reach our goal and succeed in collecting the desired amount of money we will accomplish these milestones and involve you in the whole process because you made it possible!

The bright future

We believe that a new type of fun and competitive water sport can reach everybody who loves and cares for nature, who likes biking on the waves as well and who’s a fan of avant-garde design and speed gained by human power.

We believe that the Hydrocumbent race water bike will entertain as many people as possible who choose active relaxation at lakes and seashores all around the globe. The race track is given it’s up to us how we race on it.


If there’s no money but social capital

You can also jump in to push the pedal together! You can also help us reaching our goal by spreading the word and generate hype around the race water bike to involve girls and guys who believe in this idea as well.

<h3>Raising money to purchase a Pull Cart for my dog, Olaf.</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Michael Faughn and I live in Nampa, Idaho, just outside Boise. I am 51 years old and have spent most of my life working with and training dogs as well as desiging and installing landscapes. Three years ago I was hurt on the job. The injuries were to both arms and required four surgeries. The surgeries were un-successful. I have seen 9 doctors in two different states. The diagnosis is always the same, my tendons in my elbows are deteriorating, sveral nerves are twisted and the main nerve, ulnar nerve, is pinched. I am in constant pain and have lost about 65% use of both my arms. Specialist have told me if I have one more surgery on my arms, there is an 80% chance I will loose complete use of them. I can no longer play golf, play the piano, play softball, draw, type for long periods of time, lift anything over 5lbs, no repetitive gripping or movement, no power gripping such as using a hammer, drill, holding a stearing wheel, or shopping cart. If I disregard the doctor's orders and do these things, the pain is overwhelming.</p>
<p>I live alone in a 5th wheel trailer  due to the fact that I lost my house when I was unable to return to work and was put on Social Security Disability. I could no longer afford the house payments, nor the utilities. I ownded my home for 11 years. I worked 12 hours days, 7 days a week and now nothing. I have an issue with pushing a shopping cart or carrying those small baskets when I am shopping. Normally I have to ask someone to go with me, which isn't always easy to do. I have a certified service dog. His name is Olaf, he is a Rotty. He is my best friend, he carries stuff for me in backpacks made for him. However, they only carry a small amount. Being able to use a cart such as the one in the photo would make it easier for Olaf as well as me. I could be more independant and free to go when I please.</p>
<p>Olaf has been trained to pull a cart, I just cannot afford one on my Social Security Disability income. Most of my money is spent on rent, food and utilities. There is never enough to make it to the end of the month as it is.</p>
<p>The cart shown can range in price from $300 to $650, depending on the size. The one that will work with my needs as well as Olaf, is right around $500. All the money I raise here will go for the purchase of the cart. Even if I am not able to reach my goal of $500, what is raised will be set aside and put towards the cart. The halter that is needed to pull the cart is already being donated to me by Fidogear. They are custom building Olaf a halter.</p>
<p>I have always been independent and refused to ask for help. If I couldn't do it for myslef, by myself, then I didn't need it. Getting hurt has helped me learn to be humble and ask for help. I have tried asking the makers of these carts if they would donate one and the response is always the same, their profit margines are too small to afford them the ability to donante one. I understand, it is hard for all of us.</p>
<p>The only thing I can offer in return for your donation is having your name or company's name painted on the side of the cart, such as ""This Cart Made Availalbe by the Donations from;""</p>
<p><br/>I know that not everyone can donate cash and I can appriciate that. If you can help me with spreading the word, that would be great. You can use the Indiegogo share feature</p>
I can provide copies of the specialists reports to anyone needing them.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you have a fantastic day.</div></div>","Raising money to purchase a Pull Cart for my dog, Olaf.

<p>Our hardware design is so efficient and uses so little energy that Jul Bujh can operate one full winter season without battery replacement. In fact the two AA cells that power the processor circuitry can last up to a year and a half, whilst the other two AA cells powering the motor will last full winter season. The hardware configuration has 3 main components: a motor, two optical sensors and a microcontroller. The motor rotates a shaft which is coupled with the “key” on the thermostat. The time for which the motor rotates is determined by feedback from the optical sensors and the microcontroller. The chip used is Texas Instruments’ CC2540. This chip can then communicate with your Bluetooth Smart mobile phone through BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). Thus, the user tells the chip what to do through an App and, using feedback from optical sensors, the chips turns the motor on and off, hence rotating the thermostat key at the right time. Here is the assembly diagram, cross-section and circuit for Jul Bujh.</p>

<p>If you take the case of Pakistan, a typical developing country, an average monthly gas bill is $70 for one geyser turned on to max for the full month. Using Jul Bujh, a person can typically achieve $20 in savings at the minimum. If you total that over at least 5 million households* across the nation, you obtain savings of at least $100 million every month. </p>
<p>And that is just the monetary returns. There are the obvious environment benefits: fewer fossil fuels burnt means less carbon dioxide, fewer ozone damaging gases and decreased particulates in the air. Furthermore, decreased consumption of natural gas means the nation’s energy reserves sustain for a longer time. Cost of 1 unit of gas will stabilize as danger of overconsumption passes. This means that the underprivileged will not be priced out of natural gas. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges<span><br/></span>

<p>Let's face it, hardware is difficult to do. Especially hardware which involves multiple technologies like Jul Bujh does. Jul Bujh needs three distinct set of expertise, software, hardware design and mechanical and industrial design. We have tried reducing the risk for Indiegogo community by not only developing a prototype but producing and installing 20 units last winter in the field to learn from our customers.</p>
<p>Based on this feedback we have altered the design a bit, added more software features and moved the process form a hand made approach to a mass production process. This conversion to larger scale production and debugging the final design is going on right now. We are very confident that given the experience of the team and our ability to build 20 units and install them successfully in the field will enable us to automate production of larger batches of units by first week of November so we are ready for production runs by end of November.</p>

Installation videos will be available for download through our web site close to shipment date of the product.


The Apps will be available for download from respective official App stores for iPhone and Android platforms at the time of product shipment.



All Jul Bujh devices in all packages can be shipped to different addresses all over the world. All devices can also be donated for install at a not for profit facility. We can install on your behalf at a location of your choice in Pakistan or we can select one for you if you like.

<p><b>Who
are Jasmin and Mat?</b></p>
<p><b>Jasmin
Newman</b></p>
<p>Jasmin Newman was a child who
carried the scars of physical, sexual and emotional trauma into her adult life
and had a lifelong pursuit to finding internal peace and happiness. After many
years of seeking answers through various counselling models, she came to the
ultimate realization that she alone had the power to heal from within.</p>
<p>Jasmin brings great compassion to
her work as a Male Performance Coach who specializes in helping men who are
struggling to create deeper, richer and more intimate connections.</p>
<p><b>Mat
Bodhi Bryan</b></p>
<p>Mat Bodhi Bryan has survived and
healed after experiencing a childhood that was chock full of abuse. Many of the
paths that he has taken throughout his life are a result of this history. </p>
<p>His own path involved an education
and understanding of Eastern philosophies. His path led him to Zen Buddhism, in
an effort to enhance his growth and understanding, all to end his own pain
and shame and guilt. He has developed programs based on his
education and understanding for Men at various levels of healing.</p>
<p><b>Why
are we doing this?</b></p>
<p>Due to the fact that we are both
survivors; we are both Coaches who focus on Male specific factors; we both
primarily work in an effort to create better lives.<br/>
The reality of male sexual abuse is that everyone who interacts with a survivor
who is in fact suffering with a secret can become collateral damage. This does
not have to happen. We as men deserve the possibility to show up in our daily
lives as MEN... not the scared, defenseless little boy that is hiding in the
shell of a man.</p>
<p><b>Where
is it all going?</b></p>
<p>Mat and Jasmin are working
diligently on changing the world one man at a time. The depth and breadth of what
we are looking to impact is that all of the contributions will be shared with
each survivor that we can help. It will also help progress and spread this
message. What this money will allow us to do is to step away from our other
projects and make this our main focus.</p>
<p>We have established the perks for
this drive so that each contribution over $250 will be put directly into a
scholarship for men that may not be able to afford to attend one of our
workshops. Each 'gift of giving' will directly go to benefit someone else's
growth and healing.</p>
<p>We would like the ability to help
even the homeless man on the street work through his pain and suffering. Each
of us has a reason to be on this Earth... Jasmin and Mat have discovered
theirs. We want to help others find their reason for being here.</p>
<p><b>Here is what we are asking for.</b></p>
<p>Both Jasmin and Mat have stepped
away from their own lives and businesses in an International collaborative
effort to travel through the country and shed some light on an otherwise taboo
subject. Everything that we are currently doing is creating awareness and
conversations with the media, universities and private practitioners as
well as community groups.</p>
<p><b>Here
is what we are offering.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>@ $1000 provides a scholarship for one man to attend
     one of our workshops and 3 months of coaching.</li>
<li>@ $500 provides a scholarship for one man to attend one
     of our workshops.</li>
<li>@ $250 building a scholarship for one man.</li>
<li>@ $10, $25, $50 and $100 will help build an
     infrastructure to create deepening awareness and understanding.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What
happens if we do not reach our goal?</b></p>
<p>Every dollar will be spent to create

</div></div>","Who
are Jasmin and Mat?
Jasmin
Newman
Jasmin Newman was a child who
carried the scars of physical, sexual and emotional trauma into her adult life
and had a lifelong pursuit to finding internal peace and happiness. After many
years of seeking answers through various counselling models, she came to the
ultimate realization that she alone had the power to heal from within.
Jasmin brings great compassion to
her work as a Male Performance Coach who specializes in helping men who are
struggling to create deeper, richer and more intimate connections.
Mat
Bodhi Bryan
Mat Bodhi Bryan has survived and
healed after experiencing a childhood that was chock full of abuse. Many of the
paths that he has taken throughout his life are a result of this history. 
His own path involved an education
and understanding of Eastern philosophies. His path led him to Zen Buddhism, in
an effort to enhance his growth and understanding, all to end his own pain
and shame and guilt. He has developed programs based on his
education and understanding for Men at various levels of healing.
Why
are we doing this?
Due to the fact that we are both
survivors; we are both Coaches who focus on Male specific factors; we both
primarily work in an effort to create better lives.
The reality of male sexual abuse is that everyone who interacts with a survivor
who is in fact suffering with a secret can become collateral damage. This does
not have to happen. We as men deserve the possibility to show up in our daily
lives as MEN... not the scared, defenseless little boy that is hiding in the
shell of a man.
Where
is it all going?
Mat and Jasmin are working
diligently on changing the world one man at a time. The depth and breadth of what
we are looking to impact is that all of the contributions will be shared with
each survivor that we can help. It will also help progress and spread this
message. What this money will allow us to do is to step away from our other
projects and make this our main focus.
We have established the perks for
this drive so that each contribution over $250 will be put directly into a
scholarship for men that may not be able to afford to attend one of our
workshops. Each 'gift of giving' will directly go to benefit someone else's
growth and healing.
We would like the ability to help
even the homeless man on the street work through his pain and suffering. Each
of us has a reason to be on this Earth... Jasmin and Mat have discovered
theirs. We want to help others find their reason for being here.
Here is what we are asking for.
Both Jasmin and Mat have stepped
away from their own lives and businesses in an International collaborative
effort to travel through the country and shed some light on an otherwise taboo
subject. Everything that we are currently doing is creating awareness and
conversations with the media, universities and private practitioners as
well as community groups.
Here
is what we are offering.

@ $1000 provides a scholarship for one man to attend
     one of our workshops and 3 months of coaching.
@ $500 provides a scholarship for one man to attend one
     of our workshops.
@ $250 building a scholarship for one man.
@ $10, $25, $50 and $100 will help build an
     infrastructure to create deepening awareness and understanding.

What
happens if we do not reach our goal?
Every dollar will be spent to create
the necessary infrastructure in an effort to create more awareness and impact
as many lives as possible.
What
will keep us from failing?
It is the men that we reach and the
stories that they tell that will keep us from failing. Having lived the life of
a survivor Jasmin and Mat know the pain that silence brings. 
The hurdles we will experience are
the entrenched institutions that feel men are not victims of sexual abuse, but
the perpetrators. Our voice is necessary in order to effect change
regarding the perceptions and feelings around male sexual abuse and assault.
Many people believe that this is not
an issue, when the numbers speak otherwise. At least 1 in 6 men
suffer with the knowledge that they were sexually abused or assaulted. 
Every time someone listens to us,
reads our emails, sees value in our message and reads our stories... we are
raising awareness. The snowball may be tiny at the top of the mountain, but
when it gets rolling downhill... nothing will stop the snowball until it has
reached the end of its journey. 

Sincerely,
Jasmin and Mat

In Sam's case this is done through a central line that starts in the center of his chest, tunnels under his skin to a vein in his neck and then travels down that vein to a spot close to his heart.</div>

Because they do not absorb nutrients like most people, he has to be supplied with all of his nutrition through an IV. In Sam's case this is done through a central line that starts in the center of his chest, tunnels under his skin to a vein in his neck and then travels down that vein to a spot close to his heart.








We were able to take Sam home from the hospital on May 29th, 2008, but very shortly after Sam began to show signs of TPN associated liver disease.  We made plans to take Sam to Children's Hospital Boston for an experimental treatment to help reduce and prevent the liver damage he was experiencing.  










After working with the team at Children's Hospital Boston, Sam became their ninety-fourth baby to be treated with Omegaven, an investigational treatment of refined fish oil, for his TPN associated liver disease.










Sam is able to receive Omegaven as part of an investigational study at Children's Hospital Boston, but we must travel there every eight weeks in order to remain in the study.
 
We were hopeful when we started this journey that Omegaven would be approved for use in the U.S. by 2010.  Approval has been delayed and we will need to continue these trips for possibly another two to four years.  
 
We are not able to obtain Omegaven locally as our health insurance does not cover investigational treatments.

What Your Donation Will Do




In order to continue these frequent trips to Boston, we need to raise fund to cover travel expenses for Sam and one parent until the drug is approved by the FDA and we can receive it locally. Raising our goal of $6000 will cover airfare to Boston for one year.  Any funds raised over the goal will be used for additional trips to Boston in the coming years and a portion will be donated to the Omegaven research program at Children's Hospital Boston.






The Impact




Without a doubt, receiving Omegaven has saved Sam's life.  Four years ago we were told he would not likely live to be two years old.  He has beaten the odds thanks to all of those that have continued to support him.






Other Ways You Can Help




Some people just can’t contribute, and that's OK.  You can still help! Sharing Sam's story with your family and friends by word of mouth, email, facebook, or other social media will help get the word out and reach the biggest audience possible.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

If you have any questions about this campaign, my health quest, or anything else, please feel free to shoot me an email. I cannot express how important this is to me, and how much I appreciate your contributions. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And wish me luck! :)


Other Ways You Can Help
If you are unable to contribute by funding my campaign, please feel free to contribute by way of emotional support! I will need a lot of motivation and encouragement, because the task ahead of me will not be easy, but I recognize that it is necessary for my health and happiness. Cards, emails, facebook messages, etc. are always welcome!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>(see video link in the gallery)</p>
<p><br/>Nick had been stabbed through the brain with a 10 inch screwdriver for refusing to buy cigarettes for a group of kids. He was in a coma before he hit the floor. His attacker, a 17 year old, was picked up two days later, still wearing Nick’s blood, after his friends came forward to the police.<br/>Nick had a depressed fracture of the left temple. He needed emergency surgery to remove shards of bone from his brain, and a deep penetration wound tracked through the left hemisphere towards the brain stem. He suffered elevated intracranial pressure, hypoxia, and massive subarachnoid haemorrhage. He was not expected to survive.</p>
<p><br/>For weeks Nick’s family drove the 220 mile round trip daily to be with him while Nick himself remained in a deep coma with no signs of life. His body was not absorbing food, he had contracted pneumonia and his blood was being passed through a refrigeration unit to bring the fever down. It was also evident that his right side was completely paralysed. The doctors could do no more and the family were told that should his heart give out, they would not attempt to bring him back. If by some miracle he survived, the extent of the brain injury meant that he would be severely brain injured and have no quality of life.</p>
<p><br/>But Nick chose to live. Slowly, month by month, in hospitals and rehab units in three counties, his family with him every day, Nick fought his way back. At first, unable to speak for weeks, he spelled out laboriously what he wanted to say, pointing with an uncertain left hand to letters on a board. It quickly became apparent that his personality remained, unbelievably, intact. So were his education, spelling and punctuation. Memories returned over the months and his mind cleared.</p>
<p><br/>Yet he was still trapped in a body that would not function when he was finally discharged back to his mother’s care. He could not walk, wash or care for himself. His sight was irrevocably damaged, his vision double and constantly bouncing. He had no balance and suffered from profound ataxia.<br/>Nick devised an exercise regime, spending ten to fourteen hours a day painfully encouraging his body to work again. Slowly he learned to sit unsupported, to stand, and even to walk a few steps with a walking frame. He even moved into his own home, where he lives alone with a little daily help. He had several further surgeries, but his sight has not improved.<br/>The biggest problem Nick faces is his self-confidence, utterly shattered by both the attack itself and his altered physical appearance and abilities. He is ‘ashamed’ to go out in public and consequently seldom leaves his home. He is just 28.</p>
<p><br/>The ocean voyages run by the Jubilee Sailing Trust, where disabled crew members sail a specially equipped tall ship on equal terms with able-bodied voyagers, would address this final and most insurmountable hurdle by encouraging Nick to stretch and surpass the limitations imposed by his disabilities and his own lack of self-confidence.

<p><b>The Story</b></p>
<p>The idea of Sunscreenr was first born a few years ago after seeing a family member struggle with skin cancer. We came up with the idea of a simple device that would let anyone ""see"" if they had applied sunscreen properly, even after swimming, toweling off, playing outside all day, etc.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Technology to see sunscreen. </b>We humans are pretty amazing but actually our eyes are somewhat limited. Most of us see all the colors of the rainbow but that is just a tiny portion of the light that our Sun makes. UV rays coming from the Sun are invisible to us yet we know that those rays can do us serious damage which is why we wear sunscreen. We designed Sunscreenr specifically to show you the invisible - UV light.</p>

<br/>
<div>
<p>Since sunscreen's job is to absorb UV light before it hits your skin it looks dark when you look at it through Sunscreenr. Unprotected skin appears light. Sunscreenr is made possible by the combination of several key components: a special filter that removes all light except the part of the spectrum that sunscreen absorbs, a completely custom lens made from special materials and a carefully selected sensor that can actually respond to UV light. We combined that hardware with our proprietary image processing algorithms to deliver an image to you that shows where sunscreen is on your skin.   </p>
<p><b>For the geeky. </b>Smartphones and digital cameras are designed to only capture visible light. In fact, they purposely filter-out the UV light that Sunscreenr uses to show you sunscreen. Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>The image sensors in color digital cameras and smartphone cameras have a special filter (Bayer filter) that let's them ""see"" regular colors (red, green, blue) and that filter just about eliminates the ability of the sensor to respond to the UV spectrum. </li>
<li>Lenses in both regular cameras and smartphone cameras are made from materials and have antireflection coatings that actually block most of the UV spectrum. </li>
<li>The job of a camera lens is to capture and focus light. Lenses that are made to work for visible light (like in your smartphone) do not focus UV rays properly.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><p>Our focus over the next 6 months is to get you the Sunscreenr(s) you ordered so that you can use them to be safer in the sun.</p><p>The working prototype was built with off-the-shelf components so its capabilities are limited and its cost was pretty high. By contrast, the Sunscreenr you will receive will have a completely custom camera and optics inside of a purpose-built rugged and functional shell. In the past we have completed similar product development projects for the defense, forensic and medical markets so we have a solid understanding of the challenges. Nevertheless, delays always happen. Parts get discontinued, governments put new restrictions on shipping lithium batteries, suppliers make errors or deliver late and then demand extra fees. <br/>We have built the production and fulfillment schedule conservatively using data from our suppliers. We have plans in place and have vendors ready to handle manufacturing at any scale.</p><p>We will be sending frequent updates to all of our backers to keep you informed of developments and progress. Although setbacks are inevitable, we are committed to getting Sunscreenr into your hands in a timely matter. We are committed to giving you a powerful new tool to protect yourself from sun damage. In a few short months you will be the first and only people on the <span style=""background-color: initial;"">planet to have this technology.</span></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>FAQs</b></p><p><b>What's special about Sunscreenr™?  Can't I just use my smartphone or digital

<p>- The image sensors in color digital cameras and smartphone
cameras have a special filter (Bayer filter) that let's them ""see""
regular colors (red, green, blue) and that filter just about eliminates the
ability of the sensor to respond to the UV spectrum.</p>
<p>- Lens elements in regular cameras and smartphone cameras
are made from materials that have antireflection coatings that actually block
most of the UV spectrum.</p>
<p>- Camera lenses are designed to capture and focus
light.  Lenses that are made to work for
visible light (like in your smartphone) do not focus UV rays properly.</p>
<p><b>Isn't Sunscreenr™ just a fancy lens?</b></p>
<p>No.  Sunscreenr is
made possible by the combination of several key components: a special filter
that removes all light except the part of the spectrum that sunscreen absorbs,
a completely custom lens made from special materials and a carefully selected
sensor that can actually respond to UV light. 
That hardware is combined with our proprietary image processing
algorithms to deliver an image to you that shows where sunscreen is on your
skin.  Protected areas appear dark and
unprotected skin appears light.</p>
<p><b>Is Sunscreenr™ waterproof? 
What about dust and dirt?</b></p>
<p>Sunscreenr™ is designed to an IP rating of 67 and will be
tested to MIL STD 810g-516.6.  What does
all of that mean? It means that no sand or dirt, even as fine as talcum powder
can get into Sunscreenr.  It also means
that Sunscreenr is not just splashproof but can withstand being underwater up
to 3 feet for 30 min.  Sunscreenr is
designed to handle your little one dropping it in the shallow end of the
pool!  The MIL STD testing means that
Sunscreenr passes the same ruggedness tests as the gear soldiers take into
battle.  However, like any optical device
care should be taken to prevent dirt, dust, and fingers from scratching the
exterior lenses.  When not in use,
Sunscreenr should be stored properly.</p>
<p><b>Can I use Sunscreenr™ with my eyeglasses or sunglasses on?</b></p>
<p>Yes, although some may find that the display inside of
Sunscreenr appears sharper with glasses off. 
It all depends on your eyes and what kind of prescription you have.  We have worked with an optical engineer and
have consulted with several optometrists to make Sunscreenr as easy to use a
possible for the broadest range of people. 
If you use Sunscreenr with your sunglasses on you may find that the
display looks slightly dimmer.</p>
<p><b>How long will the battery last?  How is it recharged?</b></p>
<p>Sunscreenr has been designed with a rechargable battery that
should last for several days with normal usage. 
An auto-off feature keeps the battery fresh in case you forget to turn
it off.  Sunscreenr recharges using any
micro USB charger (AC or car charger is fine).</p>
<p><b>Why the viewfinder instead of a screen?</b></p>
<p>Sunscreenr's viewfinder is designed to work on the brightest
days, in the brightest places -- beaches, pools, ski slopes, etc. -- to let you
see the images.  A regular screen can be
very hard to see in bright sunlight and often appears washed-out.  An additional benefit of the viewfinder is
that it allows us to more easily make Sunscreenr rugged and waterproof.</p>
<p><b>Will Sunscreenr™ work for people of all skin tones?</b></p>
<p>Yes! The contrast between unprotected skin and protected
skin is less dramatic than for people of lighter skin color.  Unprotected areas will appear lighter and
areas covered with sunscreen will still appear darker.  Sunscreenr's algorithms work to make this
contrast as large as possible.</p>
<p><b>What if I get sunscreen all over Sunscreenr™?</b></p>
<p>No worries!  Wipe off
the excess, wash Sunscreenr with soapy water then dry it off and you're good to
go.</p>
<p><b>Does Sunscreenr™ see all types of sunscreen?</b></p>
<p>Any Broad Spectrum sunscreen (cream, spray or powder) that's
at least SPF 15 will be visible through Sunscreenr™.</p>
<p><b>I hear that most people don't put on enough sunscreen.  Can Sunscreenr™ show me areas where my
coverage is too thin?</b></p>
<p>Yes!  Areas of thin
coverage will not appear as dark as areas that are well covered.</p>
<p><b>What if there's nobody around to check out my sunscreen
coverage?</b></p>
<p>No worries! 
Sunscreenr has been designed to be able to record and playback a short
video.  Just hit the ""record""
button and point Sunscreenr at yourself (you can use a selfie stick, your hand
or any standard camera tripod).  It will
automatically record for 30 seconds and then stop.  To see your coverage, just hit the
""play"" button and look into the viewfinder.</p>
<p><i><b></b></i></p></div>","Sunscreenr Sees Unprotected Skin. Sunscreenr shows you where you've missed a spot when applying sunscreen AND where sunscreen has worn off your skin even after sweating, swimming, or toweling off. 
Footage shot with the Sunscreenr prototype




Can You See Who Still Needs Sunscreen?  Mom did a great job with her kids but everybody needs protection.





Sunscreenr is a special viewer that changes the way you protect yourself from sun damage. We've taken technology used by scientists and made it easy to see where your skin is covered by sunscreen and where it's not. 






As Seen On








How do you know if you're protected? There are 1 Million cases of skin cancer per year in the US alone, but sunscreen can significantly reduce your chances of getting cancer. Unfortunately, most people only apply 25% to 50% of the sunscreen they should. That's where Sunscreenr comes in.




How To Use Sunscreenr. After applying sunscreen, look through Sunscreenr to see dark areas that are covered with sunscreen. See light areas that are not covered. The light areas are more vulnerable to sunburns, sunspots and other forms of sun damage.













  



Products and Pricing






All Sunscreenrs come with a micro USB charging cord and microfiber bag. The bag is for easy carrying and protection. It can also be used to clean the Sunscreenr lenses.

Shipping fees are $6 for US shipping and $16 for international shipping for one Sunscreenr. For international shipping, please note that you are responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region.

The Story
The idea of Sunscreenr was first born a few years ago after seeing a family member struggle with skin cancer. We came up with the idea of a simple device that would let anyone ""see"" if they had applied sunscreen properly, even after swimming, toweling off, playing outside all day, etc.









It took almost 2 years to build the right team who could turn the idea into reality. After several prototypes, we are now launching Sunscreenr to bring the idea to you.







Stencil was applied to her skin. Then sunscreen sprayed on her shoulder (plus a swipe of cream sunscreen on her cheek). Then removed the stencil.





Technology to see sunscreen. We humans are pretty amazing but actually our eyes are somewhat limited. Most of us see all the colors of the rainbow but that is just a tiny portion of the light that our Sun makes. UV rays coming from the Sun are invisible to us yet we know that those rays can do us serious damage which is why we wear sunscreen. We designed Sunscreenr specifically to show you the invisible - UV light.





Since sunscreen's job is to absorb UV light before it hits your skin it looks dark when you look at it through Sunscreenr. Unprotected skin appears light. Sunscreenr is made possible by the combination of several key components: a special filter that removes all light except the part of the spectrum that sunscreen absorbs, a completely custom lens made from special materials and a carefully selected sensor that can actually respond to UV light. We combined that hardware with our proprietary image processing algorithms to deliver an image to you that shows where sunscreen is on your skin.   
For the geeky. Smartphones and digital cameras are designed to only capture visible light. In fact, they purposely filter-out the UV light that Sunscreenr uses to show you sunscreen. Here’s why:

The image sensors in color digital cameras and smartphone cameras have a special filter (Bayer filter) that let's them ""see"" regular colors (red, green, blue) and that filter just about eliminates the ability of the sensor to respond to the UV spectrum. 
Lenses in both regular cameras and smartphone cameras are made from materials and have antireflection coatings that actually block most of the UV spectrum. 
The job of a camera lens is to capture and focus light. Lenses that are made to work for visible light (like in your smartphone) do not focus UV rays properly.

Risks & Challenges












Our focus over the next 6 months is to get you the Sunscreenr(s) you ordered so that you can use them to be safer in the sun.The working prototype was built with off-the-shelf components so its capabilities are limited and its cost was pretty high. By contrast, the Sunscreenr you will receive will have a completely custom camera and optics inside of a purpose-built rugged and functional shell. In the past we have completed similar product development projects for the defense, forensic and medical markets so we have a solid understanding of the challenges. Nevertheless, delays always happen. Parts get discontinued, governments put new restrictions on shipping lithium batteries, suppliers make errors or deliver late and then demand extra fees. We have built the production and fulfillment schedule conservatively using data from our suppliers. We have plans in place and have vendors ready to handle manufacturing at any scale.We will be sending frequent updates to all of our backers to keep you informed of developments and progress. Although setbacks are inevitable, we are committed to getting Sunscreenr into your hands in a timely matter. We are committed to giving you a powerful new tool to protect yourself from sun damage. In a few short months you will be the first and only people on the planet to have this technology.FAQsWhat's special about Sunscreenr™?  Can't I just use my smartphone or digital

Captain Tom Ower has really made the most of his time spent at university in
his journey to independence. His extensive cooking portfolio boasts slightly
burnt cheese on toast, undercooked pancakes and luke warm rice pudding fresh
from the tin. If we reach this milestone, we will force him to cook a very

<p>The SANS bottle is a reusable, 16 oz., glass travel bottle. The SANS lid includes an innovative vacuum pump mechanism designed to preserve the life of smoothies and juices. The vacuum pump mechanism acts as a preserver by removing the air from the bottle and maintaining a tight seal. This simple process helps keep your juices and smoothies fresher, longer.  </p>

<p>We are a group of young designers and entrepreneurs based in New York and Taipei who are passionate about juicing, health, fitness and design. After experiencing our own frustrations from the lack of preservation options for juice and smoothie-making, we decided to do something about it. We have been working on this project for over a year to design, create and test to ensure this product is perfect to preserve juice and smoothies. Now, we are finally ready to share our patent pending design with the world. Because of expensive tooling, production and shipping costs, we need your help to make our dream project a reality!</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>In order to lower the risk of production delays we have decided to move into the tooling phase. We anticipate receiving preproduction samples end of February to test the product and ensure it functions properly. We have been working hand in hand with our engineers and manufacturer throughout the product development lifecycle and will continue to monitor the progress into the final production and testing stage. We have a production schedule in place and anticipate shipping the goods from our U.S. warehouse in July. We are excited to share SANS with you and sincerly thank you for your support!</p>

I'm far from certain that my kids will stay in bed just because an owl lights up a certain color.</strong></p><p>A: Why drive a nail with your fist when it is so much easier to use a hammer ? Bedtime power struggles, nighttime awakenings, early morning wake-ups... parents waste a ton of energy trying to impose discipline simply because they lack the proper tool to do so.  We want you to be equipped with the best tool and we are confident in Ooly’s effectiveness for three main reasons:</p><p>1- Our prototype has been tested by local families  – here’s what one of them had to say: ""I was skeptical that this sleepy little owl could help with my mornings. But then the very first day my three-year-old son came in at eight instead of his usual seven. He proudly told me, ‘Ooly is green and that means time to get up!’ He loves that Ooly turns into his favorite color and I love the extra sleep. I even recommended it to my colleague to use with her little girl."" – Edith Martin, PH.D., Researcher, Topmed.ca.</p><p>2- Ooly is based on the scientific research of light and its impact on sleep carried out by NASA, Harvard Medical School, and National Institutes of Health. It is now proven that blue light inhibits the production of melatonin, delaying and disrupting sleep. Ooly is therefore equipped with a “blue blocker” mode.</p><p>3- Ooly has been designed together with five of the world’s top children sleep experts. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: What makes Ooly different from the other products out there?</strong></p><p>A: Three main aspects:</p><p>1- It is configured with an app (compatible with iOS/Apple and Android phones or tablets). Parents can effortlessly select Ooly’s color &amp; intensity to create bedtime, morning, and naptime routines adapted to their child’s needs. They simply need to use the Ooly app to set and record the color they want for various times.</p><p>2- Ooly’s design is based on the scientific research of light and its impact on sleep. It is now proven that blue light inhibits the production of melatonin, delaying and disrupting sleep. Ooly is therefore equipped with a “Blue Blocker” mode. Ooly’s light intensity can also be reduced down to the slightest glow, preventing any disturbances to your child's sleep.</p><p>3- It is portable and battery operated, with a battery sufficient for seven days’ operation without electricity. There is also an embedded memory to ensure settings are never lost. This means Ooly follows your child wherever they go (a week at grandma’s, camping over the weekend, on the plane, etc.). Also, there’s no need to have your mobile device around because once set up, Ooly remembers its settings forever.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: I see that delivery will be in May 2017. This is quite far away, why is that?</strong></p><p>A: The money raised during the crowdfunding campaign will be used to manufacture the first 1000 units of Ooly. This means that over the next months, our team will be busy performing the contract manufacturing setup, procurements of all the parts, self-tests validation, tooling, certifications, testing &amp; quality insurance, etc. All in all, this process will require six months to complete, which means we will be ready to ship units by May 2017.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: How confident are you that you can deliver on time?</strong></p><p>A: We are ready to start production as soon as the funds from our crowdfunding campaign are secured. JECA, our manufacturing partner, has over thirty years experience dealing directly with sourcing companies, factories and shipping companies. Because of our close relationships with our manufacturing partners and the extensive testing that has already been performed, we are confident in our ability to meet the timeline. Everything has been studied in details. Although unforeseen obstacles can arise during any manufacturing process, we intend to run everything efficiently, transparently, and on-time to over-deliver on the expectations of our backers.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Is the </strong><strong>electromagnetic</strong><strong> field (EMF) generated by Ooly safe?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, we had that very same concern when we designed Ooly. We know Wi-Fi signals are quite strong and did not want these anywhere near our kids. For this reason, Ooly uses a technology well known for its low power emissions called ""Bluetooth Low Energy"" (or BLE).  BLE is used in many healthcare applications. Additionally, note that Ooly only uses its radio for the setup process with the Ooly app. Once done, Ooly operates by itself.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Is Ooly BPA free?</strong></p><p>A: Absolutely.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Do I need to order a particular Ooly if I am using an iOS or Android phone/tablet?</strong></p><p>A: No, Ooly works the same with both. Ooly’s mobile application will be available for download from both the Apple App Store or Google Play.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Can I control more than one Ooly with the same iOS or Android phone/tablet?</strong></p><p>A: Yes. Ooly’s mobile application can configure them one after the other. They can then operate by themselves with their respective schedules and settings. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Does</strong><strong> Ooly necessarily require a mobile phone connection to turn its light on/off?</strong></p><p>A: No, a mobile phone or tablet connection is only required to configure Ooly’s schedule and settings. Once done, the connection is no longer required and Ooly works by itself. It will control its light according to the time of the day, its schedule, and the settings downloaded and stored in its memory.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Can you turn off Ooly’s light completely and have it 100% dark?</strong></p><p>A: Absolutely, parents can choose to have the light turned completely off during the night, and until the morning wake up. Ooly will do whatever you tell it to do. For example, the light could be switched off during the night, then it could switch on, let's say at 7:00 a.m. The same way, it could be switched on during the evening, then start fading down 5 minutes before bedtime; then it would switch off.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: What if I want to turn off Ooly’s light even if it is on for that period?</strong></p><p>A: You can always turn it off from Ooly’s app. Also, if the “Cancel Mode” was enabled for that particular period, you can turn the light off with a long press on Ooly’s head.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Can the child change Ooly’s parameters playing with press buttons?</strong></p><p>A: Ooly is 100% controlled by Ooly’s mobile application. We did this because one of the biggest pain out there is kid messing up settings by pressing buttons. In addition, if the parent disable the ""Lantern"" mode, the hidden button on Ooly’s head will not work.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Why doesn't Ooly's price compare with that of most other options?</strong></p><p>A: Ooly’s pricing is a perfect reflection of our design decisions and what we want Ooly to be known for in the market: a high-quality and elegant device in a sea of cheaper, mass-manufactured products. We want Ooly to be known for its sturdiness, effectiveness, and optimal user experience. Just as an example, we could have optimized the design for low cost by having a very small battery, but we went all-out with one of the biggest eco-friendly batteries we found on the market (this allows Ooly to last for 7 days rather than less than 24 hours!). We also spent countless hours optimizing the application to ensure Ooly’s setup is a breeze (our goal is for parents to set it up in under 3 minutes, without having to read any user manual). Those are just two quick examples; the list goes on and on...</p><p>In a sense, supporting our campaign goes beyond Ooly. It is a statement to an industry that has been neglecting quality in favor of low costs for decades. We believe that the time has come for a change, and we also believe the market is ready for it. We believe you deserve better.</p></div>","Meet OolyOoly is the first app-connected sleep companion that helps your child understand when it’s time to get up or go to bed. For more information or to buy Ooly, visit www.ooly123.com

incentive to live in harmony with health and physical laws, and find release
from the tensions of life now and eternally. Our practical grassroots approach
provides a framework that is essential before other resources are dispersed that
provide limited benefits. I have spent time at the three locations mentioned and am
aware of the fundamental needs and how simple the problem is to address.Below is what we need! 


One-Day Health Education and Lifestyle
Center
We need $107,000! This amount will cover the cost to
establish three Health Education and Lifestyle Center in the aforementioned locations.
This includes assistance for the medical missionaries that provide the essential
health education, disease prevention, lifestyle improvement training for each
location.

The One-Day Health Education and
Lifestyle Center building meets this challenge. These galvanized steel
structures will be shipped to each location and assembled on site.They are
specially designed and engineered to maximize ventilation and coated with an
earth-tone paint to reflect heat.Workers
can construct the building in a single day and ready to start training the
next.


Lifestyle Intervention Training/Network
Health education and lifestyle intervention
training for each site is accomplished by the HLCGI teams for a one/two year
period of time. At the end of one year, local educators will continue to
provide lifestyle intervention training for that location. HLCGI will continue
its involvement as a permanent board member. Each site becomes an
affiliated member of a continental/world network of affiliated Healthy
Education and Lifestyle Center.


What Do You  Receive:
As a sponsor/contributor here’s what
you receive:  
(1) A book entitled “Vaccine
Alternatives”: How to Prevent and Treat Illness Using Natural
Remedies, An Essential Guide for

<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to my Indiegogo campaign!  My name is Erica Berman and I live in
Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  I have a master’s
degree in counselling psychology and a PhD in exercise sciences.  By day I am a counsellor and therapist,
supporting people through miscarriage, infertility, trauma, anxiety, and
depression.  I am also a certified
personal trainer and fitness instructor with a lifelong passion for nutrition
and fitness. </p>
<p>I have been cooking and baking since I was 5 years old. I
love finding ways to create recipes that are both healthy and delicious and can
be enjoyed by myself and my family.  A
few years ago I discovered shirataki noodles, a carbohydrate- and calorie-free
noodle made from the konjac plant. I started learning about this plant and was
amazed by the evidence supporting its many health benefits.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1026185/files/20141118090347-konjac_root.jpg?1416330227"" src="""" style=""width: 349.96px; height: 292px;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine
for centuries and has been proven to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Help reduce cholesterol, control blood sugar,
and lower the risk of diabetes.  </p></li>
<li><p>Function as a prebiotic that contributes to
gut health and helps regulate bowel function. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Act as a powerful soluble fibre that can absorb
10 times its weight in water, which means it is also very effective at creating
a sensation of fullness and controlling appetite.  Research studies have shown that konjac can
be very useful for weight-loss.  </p></li>
<li><p>Be a versatile cooking ingredient. Due to its
unique chemical properties, konjac has many varied culinary uses and can be
used to create a wide array of mouth-watering, healthy foods.  </p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the last 4 years, I have been experimenting in my
kitchen and developing all sorts of delicious, low calorie recipes for myself
and my family.  Now I want to share all
my knowledge with you!</p>
<p>How does low-carb, low calorie, Chicken Pad Thai sound, that tastes better than take-out and contains a fraction of the fat, carbs and calories? Konjac powder creates a silky smooth sauce that perfectly adheres to the noodles.</p>

<p>Although shirataki noodles are now widely available in North
America, the flour of the konjac plant (konjac powder) is not, nor is there
much awareness of its benefits, even among doctors, dieticians and health
experts.  My goal with this campaign is
to build a website that will foster an online community dedicated to increasing
awareness of konjac, and its availability across the continent.  I also want to share the recipes I have
developed that will have you eating delicious foods to your heart’s and
stomach’s content while keeping you lean and healthy.</p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp;
What You Get</b></p>
<p>I need $10,000 to create this online community.  The money will support the construction and
maintenance of the website, which will have commerce capabilities so you can
purchase your own konjac powder I have sourced for you.  This site will also have all the information
you need, including links to the original scientific data on all of konjac’s
amazing health benefits, so you can see the evidence for yourself.  Some of my favorite recipes using konjac will
be published on the website so once you get your hands on this super food, you will
know the best ways to use it. 
Eventually, several downloadable cookbooks will also be available on the
site for purchase.</p>

<p><b>How the Funds Will Be
used</b></p>

<p>45% - Building website with full e-commerce capabilities,
searchable recipe index and e-cookbooks to download.</p>
<p>25% - Shipping/Co-Packing of <b>Konjac for Life</b> konjac Powder and shipping it out to you.</p>
<p>20% - Giving you a taste of all the benefits of konjac
powder and my expertise.</p>
<p>10% - Marketing of Konjac for Life brand and spreading
awareness of this amazing food and its culinary uses.</p>
<p>Every tiny contribution makes a difference, but if you
contribute $25 or more, you will get a free recipe book sent to you with my top
picks.  If you contribute $500 or more,
you will get a box of 10 bags of konjac powder, enough to last you more than a
year!</p>
<p>If I do not reach the goal, the funds raised will still go
toward building the website; however, the cookbooks and any other additional
features will be added later after we have begun to build awareness of our
product and brand. I will also have to pass along shipping costs of the powder to customers until the business gets to the point where I can absorb this cost. I want to make konjac powder as accessible to you as possible!</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Along with the other ways I support my clients as a
therapist, I also help many of them with their weight-loss efforts.  Losing weight is a difficult challenge and it
can be near impossible if the lifestyle changes you have to make leave you
feeling hungry and deprived. Konjac is a powerful appetite suppressant and the
recipes I have developed with it are delicious and satisfying.  Even my friends and family are amazed by all
the ways konjac can be used in cooking and baking to create fabulous
foods.  I feed konjac powder to myself
and my family, including my two young daughters, because I so passionately believe
in its value for our health.  I am
confident that konjac powder can make a significant impact on the health and
quality of life of many North Americans.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b></p>
<p>I speculate that the greatest obstacle involved in this
campaign is a total lack of awareness of the konjac plant in North America, as
well as the flood of so-called super foods to hit our market
in recent years.  Unlike things like the
goji berry, or the acai berry, which are – in my opinion – simply more
expensive alternatives to something like a blueberry, which on its own provides
incredible nutritional value, konjac is like no other plant on earth.  It provides both health benefits and culinary
utility that are matched by no other food.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways to Help</b></p>
<p>If you cannot contribute even a small amount, don’t worry, I
get it!  I am a working mom, which is why
I need crowd-funding to help me build this dream.  But there are other important ways you can
help, like simply spreading the word about this campaign.  Blast it out on social media and tell
everyone you know and we will be eternally grateful.  And don’t forget to use all of Indiegogo’s awesome
share tools!</p>

We’ve heard this before: 1 in 3 women and 1 in 2 men will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. But you never think this will apply to your family. 
When both my aunt and my brother were diagnosed with cancer, I set out to use my expertise as a Chemical Engineer to protect other families from tragedies like mine. 
The result? CertClean:  A certification that makes it easy for you to avoid carcinogens, neurotoxins and other chemicals that may affect our long term health. 
Now, we’re taking it one step further:  building a review site - like TripAdvisor for nontoxic beauty!  
Please support and enjoy the specially curated clean beauty boxes!
Sincerely,


Jenise Lee | Chemical Engineer, MBA | CEO & Founder of CertClean



 



 
Is this serum safe? Will this nontoxic lotion keep my skin hydrated? Will this clean mascara give me va-va-voom lashes? 
Combating the trend of misleading labels and buyer's hesitation is CertClean's website - a search engine full of user reviews of CertClean certified products.
 
This platform featuring authentic and unbiased CertClean certified product reviews will help you find products perfect for you.

<p>First time mom Jenna sent her 3 year old set of twins to daycare while she went to work from 6:30am-4:15pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Emmanuel and Emma were such active and loving children. Everyone love them, Jenna was raised in a 2 parent home and seemed to have lived a good life. Well one day the daycare called her to rush and pick up Emmanuel. She got to the school and the police, ems and children services were already there greeting her. She stood puzzled ""What's going on? as she began to panic, scared to ask what happened. 'Hi, my name is Ms. Flynn can we take a walk and talk. I am with social services', 'I want to know where is my children and whats going on?' the officer stepped in and responded, 'Your son is en-route to the nearest hospital and your daughter is asleep in her class.' 'I have to go can we please talk about this after I see my son PLEASE!!' Ms. Jenna the reason we called you is because the teacher said while she was changing your son she noticed blood from his rectum and discharge from his penis. Do you know what happened to him?' What are you talking about my son is loved and I don't have anyone around my children EVER! As Jenna paced back and fourth the officer responded and said, 'My name is Srgt. Batista and Ms. unless you can tell us the truth you are about to be arrested.' Jenna immediately freaked out. 'Charged, I bust my butt to make sure my children have the best of everything and even paid extra for the school to watch my babies last night until 8pm instead of 4pm. Now yuor telling me I would harm my children? Where is Mr. Watkins he watched them last night? she asked. My kids came home and my son cried and slept earlier than usual and I didn't see anything when I changed him. That man molested my CHILD! WHERE IS HE! The school director looked at her and the teacher and said Oh no! We let him go this morning because we found him laying in the classroom with the children clothes surrounding him. Immediately the officers turned to the school administration and began to follow up. Jenna broke down and rushed to her son and social services accompanied her. The social worker gave her contact information for SAFE HORIZON and they mentioned they would stay in touch if she needed anything.</p>
<p>Now the role the Faith Conquers play in this situaion would be different because,</p>
<p>1. Safe Horizon was designed for victims of Domestic Violence and Rape but not limited to any kind of abuse.</p>
<p>Faith Conquers is built to assist these special matters so the counsuling that Jenna would need to support and assist her child is not the same as a 17yr old who boyfriend beat her or 23yr old who was raped in her building. All these are unfortunate and sensitive matters. Which all should be handled as such! Society has labeled everything in one basket and one basic therapy. And some where in there is Incest if mentioned. You can get therapy for a relationship and in time let it go move on and get married etc. But what do you tell a child who may have been sexually molested by their cousin whom lives with them. Or uncle who is over every Sunday for dinner?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We need to build a organization to create shelter and awareness in families. And create safe havens for our youth if they finally speak out and seeking refuge. We will take them in and provide care and resources and shelter for them, But not under Domestic Violence and Rape but under it's catergory INCEST. This money is a small portion for a big beginning.

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>This June, Susan and I are going on our 2nd Mission Trip to Haiti.  I will be the dentist in the group and will be
treating what could be up to 300 patients during the week that we are there.
 Susan will be my “right arm” and helping out wherever she is needed.</p>
<p>We are traveling
there with a group called <strong>HART</strong> (The Haiti and Africa Relief Team) and will be
at St. Jude Parish in Morne L’Hopital, Haiti. (<a href=""http://www.h-a-r-t.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.h-a-r-t.org/</a>)</p>
<p>We will be
providing crucial medical and dental services, bringing food, working in
orphanages and doing other projects to help the people who live there.
 <strong>Many of the people we will serve have no access to a doctor or nurse, let
alone a dentist, and will probably walk miles and wait for hours to be seen by
us.</strong></p>
<p>Already the
poorest country in our half of the world, Haiti suffered a devastating
earthquake in January 2010 which left millions homeless and hungry.  In
the area we will be working with <strong>people who live on less than $1 a day</strong>.  They
desperately need our help!</p><p>

In addition to
our time, we pay for our own airfare and lodging expenses and we will also be
providing and hand carrying all of our medical and dental supplies. </p>
<p>Would you please
consider helping us with this trip?</p>
<p>If you feel moved
to help, we would gratefully appreciate any financial contribution that you are able
to provide to help the people of Haiti.  <strong>Your donation will help offset the cost of providing dental supplies and much needed medicine. </strong>Take a look at our blog and pictures from our trip last year to see the work we
accomplished in Haiti; <a href=""https://hopelovehaiti.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>https://hopelovehaiti.wordpress.com/</u></a>.

</p><p>
</p><p>We have never been in a situation that was so rewarding and
gratifying, and yet so heartbreaking at the same time. In a country with so
much despair, we just tried to focus one at a time, on each person we saw, in
hope that we could bring them relief from their pain.  With your support, we look forward to providing
care and relief for many more people this trip!</p>

<p>Using Bone Conduction technology, we have developed our own custom engineering

</div></div>","Woax is designed as a hybrid of extreme fashion with a practical approach for people's convenience. It's both easy and quick to use and will change the way people communicate forever.  Sharp design with nice ‘n’ easy wear  - in a multitude of colors to please the most discerning fashion gurus represented in two color lines loud and invisible.












Woax is meant to make your impressions more vivid; it comes with 15 standard as well as 3 of our own uniquely designed functions.  We provide vast opportunities for developers to pitch in and broaden the diversity of voice functions.



Woax's shell is made of innovative non-allergen materials, so that when worn, it adapts to the shape of your ear and to your body temperature instantaneously.
Woax focuses on your voice. The moment Woax hears the words ""Hey, Woax"", it flips out of stand-by ready for action.


Start your day with the words ""Hey, Woax!”, and receive your fast, timely and fresh information thanks to a wide variety of built-in functions and smart search techniques.






From simple phone calls, messages, time and weather to intuitive reminders, a smart system of breaking news, games, as well as posting on social networks, voice web surfing and creating voice stream, custom loops with people and what's more - God Mode.  

Prior to using Woax, you have to pass the voice initialization process once to allow voice recognition technology to tune only for your voice pattern. After the initialization process, you will be able to enjoy all Woax functions using your voice only. 




Woax is neither earphone nor headset. The basic version requires a pre-installed application as well as a Bluetooth connection. Our advanced version will have the UIM (User Identification Module) from the pre-installed mobile phone carrier, meaning the gadget will operate autonomously and be able to substitute smartphones in the near future.





This function allows the creation of your own stream mobile channel, which can be launched live in front of a global audience. Broadcast exclusive content and gain listeners. Join channels and become a listener yourself



Create an Account. Send Voice Messages. Get Listeners
One-way wireless voice transmission is intended to reach a wide audience. Just create and customize your ON AIR account and stream voice messages to your listeners. Get popular!

Tell the World. Hear the World. All Woax users can communicate within one general stream all over the world. Have an idea? Pass it on to the world. Hear people sharing their thoughts! Be God



Create your own customized loops (or user groups) by adding people from your contact list, and stay in touch anytime, anywhere by sending short voice messages

You can also use Loop Mode to share moments, discuss or collaborate with friends, family, business, leisure, private etc.

<p><strong>IMPROVE YOUR GOLF GAME WHILE CREATING US JOBS:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Andrew Spriegel. My business partner Rich Spencer and I have a very important goal: to help create jobs in the US and to help individuals become financially independent in this tough economy. I have a high success rate in commercializing products, both for companies and individuals. I own a patent law firm and several product development companies; for both of my business practices, helping individuals start their own business and escaping the stress of the corporate world is our number one priority.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IMPROVE YOU GOLF GAME AND CREATE INVENTOR INDEPENDENCE:</strong></p>
<p>Rich Spencer is the primary inventor of these innovative golf tees, and I co-own MyTee Golf Products, LLC.  Rich wants to pursue his passion which is designing and commercializing patented products.  Crowd funding is a great way to raise money for products, especially when taking into consideration that most businesses fail due to lack of adequate funding.</p>

<p>This funding campaign will increase sales of our “Made in the USA, Patent Pending” golf tees; in fact, we have already created work for others in the US. By supporting our business, you’re also supporting the working population, strengthening the economy for all.   </p>
<p>With your help, we can increase sales by licensing college logos to print on our golf tee strips, attending tradeshows, increase marketing of the tees, and obtaining golf sponsors.    </p>

<p><strong>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU?</strong></p>
<p>First, you’ll receive a large discount on our strips of 10 revolutionary golf tees, based on the amount of money you give.</p>

<p>Our teacher has been a passionate educator for the last 7 years!  A few weeks ago, just days before she was to return to the classroom, she found out she was suffering from serious health issues...the most problematic was that she had severe nerve damage in her right eye which will lead to blindness if left untreated.  Her doctor has taken her off of work, while she prepares for her upcoming surgery and gets treatment to improve her health!  She has been devastated by the fact that she not able to work with more amazing students this year, but is even overwhelmed by the impact that this is and will continue to have on her two amazing children.  With mounting medical bills, she fears how she will manage,  following the surgery and during her recovery!  She has given her heart and soul to so many and now we are reaching out to help her!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Her insurance will cover a marginal part of the cost of the surgery.  Since she is unable to work, we have been taking up small collections through fundraising activities to help with housing, food and childcare, while she recovers from her eye surgery.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>YOUR HELP will allow her to get the surgery she needs and keep her children living more stable at such a difficult time!  They are counting down the days to her surgery in November and seem more and more nervous each day!  To her students she is a ROCK...to her children, she is the WORLD!  Please support this project and spread the word!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Your thoughts and well wishes are priceless!  There is so much healing power in a kind word, so if you can't contribute, send a message that we may pass on to her for encouragement!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our angel, Abagayle Rose Muszynski, was born on 9-14-2011 with a very rare genetic birth disorder called Aicardi Syndrome. When Abagayle arrived in this world, she appeared to be a perfectly healthy baby except for an eye that would not open. This was the beginning of our nightmare, only it became a reality. </p>
<p>Just a few weeks after her birth, Abby was poked, prodded, and led through EEG's, MRI's, Cat Scans and eye exams that forced her little eyes open by metal prongs and then dialated. All this led to her final devasting diagnoses which was delivered by a Pediatric Opthamalogist 6 weeks later. We will never forget that dreadful day. There we sat holding our baby girl in the doctor's chair, holding hands. The doctor came in and asked ... do you want ""the good news first or bad news""? What an insane question to ask at a time like this. </p>
<p>We were then told that our beautiful innocent baby girl was born with a very rare birth defect called Aicardi Syndrome. She would suffer with daily life threatening seizures, chronic pulmonary/breathing problems, and severe retardation. She may never walk, talk or function on her own. This was the bad news. Then the good news came...the doctor then told us ""at least she wasn't a boy."" Baby boys die in utero. To make matters even worse, we were told Abby had microphalymia (small eye) and was blind in her left eye. She also had Agensis of the Corpus Collosum where part of her brain is missing. These additional medical problems were part of the markers for the Aicardi disease. This news was the beginning of a devasting journey for which we were about to embark.</p>
<p>And here were are now...nine months later where Baby Abby, seeks to amaze us every day. She wakes every day with a smile that lights up the room. She kicks and puts her hands up with she sees Mommy or Daddy enter the room - but she struggles to lift her head or body as she has no head control. She tries to suck her thumb and sometimes gets it to her mouth but sometimes she is too shaky with her hands. And music seems to comfort her most as she falls asleep with her favorite lullaby.</p>
<p><strong>Abby has many special needs that we cannot meet alone. Therefore, we are asking humbly for your help. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Si</strong>nce Abby's birth, mom has had to resign from her job to care for Abby on a full time basis. Dad works but resources are very limited. Abby has no insurance and out of pocket medical expenses are unmanageable. We cannot meet Abby's medical, physical and basic daily needs.</p>
<p>Abby currently wears a conformer in her left eye that needs to be treated and fitted by an ocularist on a regular basis. This helps her eye socket and muscles to develop and grow so that her eyes will appear normal and the same size. Insurance does not pay for this continued treatment. We are seeking help for Abby to get a new prosthetic eye and continue treatment.</p>
<p>Abby takes several medications and treatments to control her daily seizures. We are seeking help to cover the costs of the medications that are not covered by insurance. Some of the medications come from Canada and other areas of the world and they are not covered by insurance. These medications are vital to control her seizures.</p>
<p>Abby requires special equipment for her physical therapy, speech therapy, and vision therapy which is not covered. Some of these items include a future wheel chair, special seats, strollers, car seats, ramps, special needs van, housing, visual aids and many more items.</p>
<p>Every penny makes a difference to us. We are all faced with difficult times, so if you are unable to give please help us to spread the word and share our story so that maybe it will get the attention it needs.</p>
<p>Aicardi Sydrome is a very rare disease and there are not many organizations or charities out there for support. We hope that someday we will have the attention we need for the funding of our little ""angels.""</p>

In 2011, the United States Supreme Court found that the overcrowding had gotten so bad — close to double the prisons’ designed capacity — that inmates’ health and safety were unconstitutionally compromised. 





The Training Center's ""Prison Release Program"" provides immediate transitional support designed for rehabilitation, redemption, and transformation.

<p>Josie Nordman, age 20, has cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that she was diagnosed with at four months old. As time has progressed, so has her disease. After suffering a very large loss of lung function this past year, she progressed to end stage lung disease, and her only hope of living was to receive a lung transplant. On July 28 2013, a donor was found, a match was made and Josie underwent lung transplant surgery.</p>
<p>The financial cost of the surgery and ongoing medical expenses over the first year is astonomical. Josie's family is holding a series of fundraisers throughout the year to help pay for these expenses and would deeply appreciate any contributions. No donation is too small...whether you have $5 to spare or $50, any amount will help. Thank you in advance for keeping Josie in your thoughts.</p>
<p>Josie loves theater and horses.  She is a junior at Northwestern University where she studies theater and communications. She is an avid equestrian and until she got too sick to ride, she was part of Northwestern’s equestrian team. She also loves soccer and is a fan of Sporting Kansas City. Despite having spent most of her young life in the hospital, her positive and realistic outlook about her situation is an inspiration to everyone who meets her.</p>

<p>4:00am <span>Josie has been taken into the operating room and being prepped for surgery. There are still tests to be done on the donors lungs. Our deepest condolences go to the donor's family. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and with Josie at this time.</span></p>

<p><span><span>4:00pm Surgery is complete and Josie is doing well. She is now in ICU connected to a ventilator. She will be kept sedated for at least another 5 hours and then they will attempt to remove the ventilator. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>10:00pm Josie is sedated and comfortable but not ready for breathing tube to be removed.  The tube will hopefully be removed sometime tomorrow morning.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Both chest tubes are now out. She <span>is eating pumpkin seeds and potato chips. Today she took a walk around her room and into the corridors of the ICU with her new lungs.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Josie has been moved to a regular room. She is off of oxygen completely and her oxygen saturation is 98%. 5 days ago she was showing sats of 80% or less off oxygen.

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">THURSDAY August 1 2013</span></p>

Terence and his team are ready to bring this product to market and wants the Indie Gogo community to be a part of the initial launch.  Terence developed the idea for the XLP Tennis Trainer while he was training his daughter, Noel. Terence was frustrated by the tennis training tools available at the time because of the lack of productivity and the cost of these products.Terence decided to use his expertise and create his own training system that would produce more effective results, be more affordable and cause less injuries. While training his daughter Noel, Terence used simple materials in the back of his house to create the first iteration of the XLP. This enabled Terence to train Noel at any point in time and in any location. With the aid of the early stage XLP Trainer, Noel improved her skills and went on to become a No. 1 USTA junior in the country and to obtain numerous athletic scholarships. Finally, Terence decided to take his concept a little further and fully develop the XLP Tennis Trainer to be easily be accessible and affordable to people across the world.  When sitting down to build the initial XLP Trainer, the goals were to create a training product that would: 

Allow training anywhere, rain or shine. A lot of tennis training tools focused on being outside on the court, which could be affected by the weather. With XLP Tennis Training System, Terence is able to train his players indoor or outdoor while producing maximum and effective training. 

Technique based training versus Results based training. Young and developing players often develop poor mechanics in an effort to achieve short term results. The XLP Tennis Training System eliminates the opportunity for players to lock into a poor technique, produce low impact  and drastically reduce the chances of injury. 

Create opportunity to train multiple players simultaneously with or without a coach. 
Give players an opportunity to work on every type of swing including serve. 
Enables high performance training without using a basket of balls
   Terence has developed many iterations of his trainer over the years, finally landing on three revolutionary products: The XLP stationary trainer; XLP handheld trainer; and X-Tremity attaching trainer.   The XLP Stationary trainer allows players to work on every type of ground stroke swing in a low impact, repeatable fashion. Players can train indoors or outdoors, with or without a coach or trainer. With the stationary trainer, players and coaches do not have to chase down or collect balls.  To develop a good serve, the XLP handheld trainer allows coaches and players to focus on developing the right mechanics on an overhead smash and serve.  The X-Tremity is a dynamic training tool that allows players to work on a variety of different swings at every possible angle. The X-Tremity can be easily attached to different items such as but not limited to; polls, fences and trees. The X-Tremity can be adjusted at any angle that is suitable for the player.  Terence has 20 years of experience as a tennis trainer and skills coach.

<h3>Handball: It's Your Favorite Sport (You Just Don't Know It Yet)</h3>
<p>Handball, or team handball, is a fast-paced, high-scoring Olympic sport, played between two teams on a court approximately the size of a basketball court. Seven (7) players, including a goalkeeper, from each team try to outscore their opponent by shooting a volleyball-sized ball into their opponent’s net. Each player can carry the ball for up to three steps before having to dribble, pass, or shoot, and anywhere between 30-50 goals are scored during a typical game.</p>
<p>As one of the most popular Olympic and professional sports in the world, handball has a worldwide following. During the 2016 Rio Olympics, handball was the second highest-ticketed sport, and over 800,000 people attended matches during the 2019 IHF Handball World Championships. On top of that, thousands of fans attend professional handball matches every week in countries like Germany, Sweden, and France. </p>
<p>With the United States hosting the 2028 Olympics, Team USA will have to field an Olympic handball team for the first time since 1996.  </p>
<p>However, outside elementary school gym classes and a handful (pun intended) of amateur clubs, handball does not exist in the United States (which may explain why handball, along with table tennis and badminton, are the only<i> </i>sports that the USA has <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>never</strong></span> won an Olympic medal in).</p>

<li>Fielding the most dominant handball team in America</li>
<li>Providing world-class instruction for aspiring handball players and coaches</li>

<p>Currently, handball in the United States is unwatchable. </p>

<p>We understand that, but hear us out: In the United States, it's difficult for even the most dedicated handball player to compete against high-level competition. Unless one plays for the national team, it's unlikely that an American player will have the opportunity to test themselves against experienced teams and players from across the world, let alone play in an environment thats intense and electrifying. </p>
<p>On top of that, if Detroit HC wins the USA Team Handball National Championship, we qualify for the IHF SuperGlobe Tournament in Saudi Arabia, where we'll play against the professional best clubs in the world.</p>

<p>On his innocent face touched by pain, from time to time a shy smile
makes its place. He knows he is sick, feels very weak, but still believes that,
despite everything, one day he’ll get well.</p>
<p>At the age of only 13 Mihai is fighting a hard battle with cancer. The
boy has an aggressive brain tumour (the full diagnosis shows an expansive, recidivating
gangliar process 
in the right side of the cerebral falx). The disease was detected at
only 7 years when it affected his sight. Mihai's parents say they will never
forget this day which changed entirely the life of this family. </p>
<p>The disease has progressed very rapidly since then.  In 2008 the boy has gone through 3
neurosurgical interventions. At just one week from the first intervention the
second followed and in June, this year - the third one. </p>
<p>The young boy has long lost the feeling of a normal childhood by
spending so much time in hospitals and fighting physical pain.</p>
<p>Mihai lags in growth, has hormonal dysfunctions and after the second
operation has also been diagnosed with <i>diabetes insipidus</i>. He also has
teeth problems which cause terrible pains and the dentists are afraid to treat
him because of the associated risks.</p>
<p>The boy had also a cardiac arrest and was in a state of coma for 3
weeks. </p>
<p>Currently Mihai is going through hell, he can't go out or attend
school. The disease has changed him a lot, he cried and was close to entering a
depression although this is very unfamiliar for children of his age. </p>
<p>The treatment and the medical interventions carried in the local
medical institutions, here in Moldova, attained very little. </p>
<p>""We have been advised to go to Germany for treatment but the
prices were excruciating"", said Liliana with a sigh, ""we just don't
have such money. Nevertheless, our consulting doctor has told us that the
specialists from a highly equipped, proficient clinic in Turkey can help us in
our case. The operation alone would cost about 17.000 euro which is still a lot
for our modest budget but we truly hope to gather these money."" </p>
<p>“We are determined to fight no matter what” says Mihai's mother Liliana.
Despite all the difficulties, she has always been by her child trying to
comfort him and to ease his pain. The family is ready for everything to change
Mihai's fate but for that your help is also crucial.</p>
<p>This story has appeared in a few instances in the local mass media
(see links below) and has received a number of contributions, however giving
the economic hardships in Moldova and the relative frequency of such cases, the
local contributions, are often insufficient to cover the needs.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways you could contribute financially to this case.
You can either make a regular donation via Indiegogo or transfer the money to
one of the following accounts (in one of the available currencies which you
find convenient). You may also contact directly Mihai's family at  (+373) 69649704.</p>

On his innocent face touched by pain, from time to time a shy smile
makes its place. He knows he is sick, feels very weak, but still believes that,
despite everything, one day he’ll get well.
At the age of only 13 Mihai is fighting a hard battle with cancer. The
boy has an aggressive brain tumour (the full diagnosis shows an expansive, recidivating
gangliar process 
in the right side of the cerebral falx). The disease was detected at
only 7 years when it affected his sight. Mihai's parents say they will never
forget this day which changed entirely the life of this family. 
The disease has progressed very rapidly since then.  In 2008 the boy has gone through 3
neurosurgical interventions. At just one week from the first intervention the
second followed and in June, this year - the third one. 
The young boy has long lost the feeling of a normal childhood by
spending so much time in hospitals and fighting physical pain.
Mihai lags in growth, has hormonal dysfunctions and after the second
operation has also been diagnosed with diabetes insipidus. He also has
teeth problems which cause terrible pains and the dentists are afraid to treat
him because of the associated risks.
The boy had also a cardiac arrest and was in a state of coma for 3
weeks. 
Currently Mihai is going through hell, he can't go out or attend
school. The disease has changed him a lot, he cried and was close to entering a
depression although this is very unfamiliar for children of his age. 
The treatment and the medical interventions carried in the local
medical institutions, here in Moldova, attained very little. 
""We have been advised to go to Germany for treatment but the
prices were excruciating"", said Liliana with a sigh, ""we just don't
have such money. Nevertheless, our consulting doctor has told us that the
specialists from a highly equipped, proficient clinic in Turkey can help us in
our case. The operation alone would cost about 17.000 euro which is still a lot
for our modest budget but we truly hope to gather these money."" 
“We are determined to fight no matter what” says Mihai's mother Liliana.
Despite all the difficulties, she has always been by her child trying to
comfort him and to ease his pain. The family is ready for everything to change
Mihai's fate but for that your help is also crucial.
This story has appeared in a few instances in the local mass media
(see links below) and has received a number of contributions, however giving
the economic hardships in Moldova and the relative frequency of such cases, the
local contributions, are often insufficient to cover the needs.
There are multiple ways you could contribute financially to this case.
You can either make a regular donation via Indiegogo or transfer the money to
one of the following accounts (in one of the available currencies which you
find convenient). You may also contact directly Mihai's family at  (+373) 69649704.

</h3> <p>A friends little son had to go to the hospital a few days ago because he fall badly on his head. He had to stay there for almost a week and he was very unhappy. The room he stayed in was like a normal hospital room. The walls where painted in some grey and light yellow, but that was it. No colorful pictures for the kids to look at.</p>
<p>When i was 4 years old, I had to go to the hospital too. There they had one wall in every room covered completely with fairytail pictures like Snowwhite or Bambi.</p>
<p>This made my stay so much more fun and so much less frightening.</p>Now we try to raise money to repaint the rooms or at least hang a view fun paintings. <br/>Another thing, that is missing is a colorful fun area for the kids to play at.

</div></div>","Short Description
 A friends little son had to go to the hospital a few days ago because he fall badly on his head. He had to stay there for almost a week and he was very unhappy. The room he stayed in was like a normal hospital room. The walls where painted in some grey and light yellow, but that was it. No colorful pictures for the kids to look at.
When i was 4 years old, I had to go to the hospital too. There they had one wall in every room covered completely with fairytail pictures like Snowwhite or Bambi.
This made my stay so much more fun and so much less frightening.Now we try to raise money to repaint the rooms or at least hang a view fun paintings. Another thing, that is missing is a colorful fun area for the kids to play at. Maybe like this one from a hospital somewhere in Asia.This is a picture of the current play area:Another great feature would be a little reading corner where parents or older siblings can pick up a book and read to the little ones.
  What you get out of it...
Our plan is to paint a 1cm x 1cm square for each euro someone spends on a 1m x 1m square canvas (We do this twice of course). When we really reach our goal to fill the complete canvas, we will raffle it of to one of you.
We will also have little thank you notes and pictures from the kids in the hospital.

</div><div>

Months of appointments with public health service doctors, physical therapies, all kinds of tests, and still no one understood what could be causing my new pain. </span></p>They all insisted it could be caused by the many hours I spent working in front of the computer, but the truth is that my pain kept growing and growing, until on February 24th I arrived in the ER with a pain that wouldn't even let me breath.  I was forced to take a sick-leave and stop going to work.<span><br/><br/>Finally, on March 20th -my mother just arriving from Caracas- they gave me the sensed diagnose: <b>Fibromyalgia</b>. I had heard of it but had no idea of what it was or meant. I tried to put some of my experience with arthritis into it by attacking the condition on time to cut its space, but sadly the response from Social Security was slow and erroneous, and without me even knowing, the syndrome had already built up.</span></span><span><br/><br/>Fortunately, I have learned about a doctor who assures the syndrome has a cure -and I have no doubt- but appointments are expensive and not covered by any type of insurance. Even so I didn't hesitate, having heard the positive experience of a girl that had gone through the same situation was my main motivation, and on April 8th I went to my first appointment. Since that day I began evolving favorably.</span><br/><br/>
</div><div>
<br/>
<div>
<h3><span><b>What it means to live with my condition</b></span></h3>
<p>Ever since that first appointment, the Doctor was very clear in warnings and recommendations:</p>
<p><b>-</b> <b>It is important to not stay alone.</b> I am blessed and fortunate to be able to have my mother come from Caracas. Her support, guidance and energy have been crucial on this 'complicated' process. She is still living -and sleeping- with me in Madrid.</p>
<p><b>- The process is long, slow and expensive... and she was right!</b> I'm not yet able to retake my usual pace of work and the negative financial impact is extremely high.</p>
<p><b>- Avoid stress and anxiety.</b> Every Time I learn to liberate myself more, to put less weight on my shoulders, to vent. I have learned that, even if for now it means I have to rely on medicines to make it possible, I do.</p>
<p><b>- Stay positive.</b> I can't be any other way. Even though there are natural low moments, I'm now aware this new syndrome has a cure, I have found the right doctor, I have affective and emotional support from friends and family and, thanks to the angels on my way, this road has been more manageable and I am ready for recovery.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b> <b>for fibromyalgia</b> is expensive, that is the undeniable truth.  I have been lucky enough to find ways to fund my treatment, but it has been at the cost of  a very scary word, particularly for someone who is currently unable to work: Debt.</p>
<p><span>Fortunately, I'm now starting to feel myself again, I can finally sleep and therefore, think and create: it is time to get hands-on!  I still have months of upcomming appointments, medicines and physical therapy to rehabilitate my muscles almost atrophied because of the counter-indicated complete rest initial treatment.</span></p>

<p>- With your <b>affection</b>, which I will always be grateful for.</p>
<p>- Helping me pay my <b>debts</b> ( €10,000 until now) and continue with what is left of my treatment  withouth entering into another debt again -which will also help eliminate additional stress that only makes my condition stronger.</p>
<p>- By being <b>multiplying agents</b> of my campaign and leveraging the power of a great ripple effect.</p>
<p>- By helping others <b>learn</b> about <b>Fibromyalgia</b> and understand the particularities of this condition in order to give diagnosed -or undiagnosed- patients the hope of having a way out.</p>

Mi A.R. entró en remisión por primera vez hace unos 10 años y hoy, salvo por los inconfundibles signos que llevo en mi cuerpo, que me individualizan y caracterizan, la artritis es para mi casi inexistente en síntomas.</i><p></p><p><i>Hace más de año y medio comencé a sentir dolor otra vez, uno distinto, permanente, muscular. Meses de visitas a médicos de la salud pública sin tener idea de razones; ﬁsioterapias, pruebas, un 'puede ser consecuencia de tantas horas sentada trabajando' y el dolor en aumento. <br/></i></p><p><i>Dada de baja tras acabar en urgencias el 24 de febrero con un dolor que no me dejaba ni respirar, ﬁnalmente el 20 de marzo después de recoger a mi mamá al aeropuerto, dejar sus maletas en casa e irnos al médico, el temido diagnóstico fue develado: <b>Fibromialgia</b>. Había escuchado hablar de ella, pero realmente no tenía ni idea. Intenté partir de las bases de mi experiencia con la artritis atacando la nueva realidad a tiempo para no darle más campo, pero lamentablemente la respuesta de la seguridad social fue lenta y con grandes desaciertos. Sin yo saberlo el síndrome se había incubado. </i></p><p><i><span style=""""></span></i></p><p><span><i>Supe de una doctora que asegura que la condición tiene cura, y no lo pongo en duda, pero las consultas son costosas y no las cubre ningún seguro. Ni lo pensé: conocer la positiva experiencia de una chica que había pasado por lo mismo fue mi principal motivación. Así que el 8 de abril tuve mi primera cita y desde ese día hasta hoy he evolucionado favorablemente. </i></span></p><br/>
<div>
<h3><span><i>Lo que significa vivir con fibromialgia</i></span></h3>
<p><i>Desde esa primera cita, las advertencias y recomendaciones médicas fueron muy claras:</i></p>
<p><i><b>- Es importante que estés siempre acompañada.</b> Afortunadamente mi mamá pudo viajar desde Caracas, su apoyo, su guía y su empuje han sido claves en este proceso un tanto 'complicado'. Ella sigue viviendo -y durmiendo- conmigo en Madrid.</i></p>
<p><i><b>- El proceso es largo, lento y costoso, ¡y tenían razón!</b> Aún no estoy en capacidad de retomar mi ritmo habitual de trabajo y el impacto económico ha sido muy elevado.</i></p>
<p><i><b>- Evita el estrés y la ansiedad.</b> Voy aprendiendo a liberarme cada vez más, a cargarme menos, a desahogarme, aunque signifique, por ahora, recurrir a medicamentos que me faciliten el proceso. </i></p>
<i><b>- Mantente positiva.</b> No puedo ser de otra manera. A pesar de los momentos naturales de bajón, tengo en cuenta que la condición tiene cura, que he dado con el médico indicado, y que cuento con el apoyo de amigos y familiares.<br/><br/></i>

My ""not so brief"" story of health

I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) when I was 14. Since then I’ve understood what it’s like to live in pain. 10 years ago my RA entered on remission stage and today, except for the unmistakable signs my body shows, which personalize and characterize me, arthritis is almost nonexistent on most of its symptoms.

Over a year and a half ago I started to feel pain again, but a different kind: it was permanent, muscular. Months of appointments with public health service doctors, physical therapies, all kinds of tests, and still no one understood what could be causing my new pain. They all insisted it could be caused by the many hours I spent working in front of the computer, but the truth is that my pain kept growing and growing, until on February 24th I arrived in the ER with a pain that wouldn't even let me breath.  I was forced to take a sick-leave and stop going to work.Finally, on March 20th -my mother just arriving from Caracas- they gave me the sensed diagnose: Fibromyalgia. I had heard of it but had no idea of what it was or meant. I tried to put some of my experience with arthritis into it by attacking the condition on time to cut its space, but sadly the response from Social Security was slow and erroneous, and without me even knowing, the syndrome had already built up.Fortunately, I have learned about a doctor who assures the syndrome has a cure -and I have no doubt- but appointments are expensive and not covered by any type of insurance. Even so I didn't hesitate, having heard the positive experience of a girl that had gone through the same situation was my main motivation, and on April 8th I went to my first appointment. Since that day I began evolving favorably.



What it means to live with my condition
Ever since that first appointment, the Doctor was very clear in warnings and recommendations:
- It is important to not stay alone. I am blessed and fortunate to be able to have my mother come from Caracas. Her support, guidance and energy have been crucial on this 'complicated' process. She is still living -and sleeping- with me in Madrid.
- The process is long, slow and expensive... and she was right! I'm not yet able to retake my usual pace of work and the negative financial impact is extremely high.
- Avoid stress and anxiety. Every Time I learn to liberate myself more, to put less weight on my shoulders, to vent. I have learned that, even if for now it means I have to rely on medicines to make it possible, I do.
- Stay positive. I can't be any other way. Even though there are natural low moments, I'm now aware this new syndrome has a cure, I have found the right doctor, I have affective and emotional support from friends and family and, thanks to the angels on my way, this road has been more manageable and I am ready for recovery.


What Art for Health is for







Treatment for fibromyalgia is expensive, that is the undeniable truth.  I have been lucky enough to find ways to fund my treatment, but it has been at the cost of  a very scary word, particularly for someone who is currently unable to work: Debt.
Fortunately, I'm now starting to feel myself again, I can finally sleep and therefore, think and create: it is time to get hands-on!  I still have months of upcomming appointments, medicines and physical therapy to rehabilitate my muscles almost atrophied because of the counter-indicated complete rest initial treatment.
Don't stop and don't look back: my steps are forward, I'll end up stronger and healthier after this!
I'd like to invite you to be a part of my happy way out of this condition and of the decision I made months ago, and keep on telling myself every day: ""This is the beginning of my healthy life, I will be healthy for the many upcoming years I will live"".



How you can help
You may be asking yourselves why I’m sharing this now or how you can be part of this project… in many ways:
- With your affection, which I will always be grateful for.
- Helping me pay my debts ( €10,000 until now) and continue with what is left of my treatment  withouth entering into another debt again -which will also help eliminate additional stress that only makes my condition stronger.
- By being multiplying agents of my campaign and leveraging the power of a great ripple effect.
- By helping others learn about Fibromyalgia and understand the particularities of this condition in order to give diagnosed -or undiagnosed- patients the hope of having a way out.






Perks of supporting our case
You’ll get rewards on exchange! I'll give you what I love most and what I'm best at: photographs!.
Depending on the contribution you make you will have the opportunity of choosing a photo from an unpublished series called LIFE that my eye captured 4 years ago. I was saving it for the right moment, and the right moment has arrive 
The size of the photograph will be related to the amount of your donation, and it will be sent digitally to avoid costs of printing and mailing. You will also receive all the information of the selected photo, my credits and, if you wish, a dedicated postcard.

The reach: beyond helping me
The objective of the campaign goes far beyond helping me fund and complete the treatment required for my recovery. 
A percentage of your contribution will be destined to continue to collaborate with  the non-profit foundation  Fundación Internacional del Dolor , registered in the Spanish Ministry of Education and Culture in 1997  (registry number: Madrid 1-3-502),  focused on investigating and raising awareness around pain related conditions. 
Another percentage will be given to a special person who took care of me with so much love, who stayed with me, always aware of my needs before my mother could be with me and who has kept on helping us after my mom came. Chain of favors? Kind of...
I will keep on doing everything I can to recover: I have already added exercise to my daily routine, and I will give everything I have within me to continue to get better, and continue enjoying LIFE, because hey, I enjoy myself too! My spirit, my passions and my incessant attitude of expressing everything I come up with.

Mi ""no tan breve"" historia de saludA los 14 años fui diagnosticada con artritis reumatoide y desde entonces descubrí lo que era vivir con dolor. Mi A.R. entró en remisión por primera vez hace unos 10 años y hoy, salvo por los inconfundibles signos que llevo en mi cuerpo, que me individualizan y caracterizan, la artritis es para mi casi inexistente en síntomas.Hace más de año y medio comencé a sentir dolor otra vez, uno distinto, permanente, muscular. Meses de visitas a médicos de la salud pública sin tener idea de razones; ﬁsioterapias, pruebas, un 'puede ser consecuencia de tantas horas sentada trabajando' y el dolor en aumento. Dada de baja tras acabar en urgencias el 24 de febrero con un dolor que no me dejaba ni respirar, ﬁnalmente el 20 de marzo después de recoger a mi mamá al aeropuerto, dejar sus maletas en casa e irnos al médico, el temido diagnóstico fue develado: Fibromialgia. Había escuchado hablar de ella, pero realmente no tenía ni idea. Intenté partir de las bases de mi experiencia con la artritis atacando la nueva realidad a tiempo para no darle más campo, pero lamentablemente la respuesta de la seguridad social fue lenta y con grandes desaciertos. Sin yo saberlo el síndrome se había incubado. Supe de una doctora que asegura que la condición tiene cura, y no lo pongo en duda, pero las consultas son costosas y no las cubre ningún seguro. Ni lo pensé: conocer la positiva experiencia de una chica que había pasado por lo mismo fue mi principal motivación. Así que el 8 de abril tuve mi primera cita y desde ese día hasta hoy he evolucionado favorablemente. 

Lo que significa vivir con fibromialgia
Desde esa primera cita, las advertencias y recomendaciones médicas fueron muy claras:
- Es importante que estés siempre acompañada. Afortunadamente mi mamá pudo viajar desde Caracas, su apoyo, su guía y su empuje han sido claves en este proceso un tanto 'complicado'. Ella sigue viviendo -y durmiendo- conmigo en Madrid.
- El proceso es largo, lento y costoso, ¡y tenían razón! Aún no estoy en capacidad de retomar mi ritmo habitual de trabajo y el impacto económico ha sido muy elevado.
- Evita el estrés y la ansiedad. Voy aprendiendo a liberarme cada vez más, a cargarme menos, a desahogarme, aunque signifique, por ahora, recurrir a medicamentos que me faciliten el proceso. 
- Mantente positiva. No puedo ser de otra manera. A pesar de los momentos naturales de bajón, tengo en cuenta que la condición tiene cura, que he dado con el médico indicado, y que cuento con el apoyo de amigos y familiares.







¿De qué se trata Art for Health?


Es una campaña que busca recaudar fondos a través de una serie inédita de fotografías realizadas en 2010. Lo costoso del tratamiento es una realidad, aunque no imaginaba hasta qué punto. He contado con la suerte de haber tenido de dónde sacar dinero hasta ahora, pero eso ha signiﬁcado una palabra temida: deudas. 
Llegó el momento de poner manos a la obra, de volver a crear. Yo no me quedo quieta ni miro hacia atrás, todos mis pasos son hacia adelante, ¡de esto saldré fortalecida!
Gracias al ejército de ángeles en mi camino esto se ha hecho más llevadero a todo nivel, pero aún faltan meses de citas, rehabilitación y fortalecimiento del sistema muscular, casi atroﬁado por el reposo inicial, contraindicado para la fibromialgia. 
Sin embargo,  además de las deudas adquiridas, hará falta más dinero para esta etapa de tratamiento y recuperación...  Es aquí donde vuestro aporte comienza a ser pieza fundamental en mi proceso de recuperación.




¿Cómo puedes ayudar?

Ahora os debéis estar preguntando porqué estoy compartiendo ahora cómo podéis ser parte de este proyecto… De muchas formas:
- Con vuestro afecto, del cual siempre estaré agradecida.
- Ayudándome a pagar mis deudas (€ 10.000 hasta ahora) y continuar con el resto de mi tratamiento sin endeudarme de nuevo - cosa que además ayuda a eliminar el estrés que solo hace empeorar mi condición. 
- Siendo agentes multiplicadores de mi campaña y hacer que se cree una reacción en cadena.
- Ayudando a otros a informarse sobre la fibromialgia y que entiendan las particularidades de la condición, dándole a los diagnosticados - o no diagnosticados - la esperanza de que existe una salida. 






Lo que consigues al apoyar esta campaña¡Obtienes premios a cambio! Daré lo que más me gusta y lo que sé hacer mejor: ¡fotos!
 Dependiendo de tu contribución tendrás la oportunidad de elegir entre las imágenes de una serie inédita llamada LIFE que mi ojo capturó hace 4 años. La tenía reservada para algún momento importante y ese momento ha llegado.  El tamaño de la imagen varía de acuerdo al aporte realizado, y en la mayor parte su entrega será en formato digital para evitar costos de impresión y envío postal. Con cada una recibirás también la información de la fotografía seleccionada, un certificado con los créditos de autoría y, si lo deseas, una postal imprimible dedicada.

El alcance de la campaña según el aporteCon tu aporte conseguirás ayudarme a conseguir una completa recuperación, permitiéndome cumplir con los pasos necesarios dar continuidad a mi tratamiento, Un porcentaje de tu contribución está dedicado a continuar  la colaboración directa con la fundación sin fines de lucro Fundación Internacional del Dolor,  registrada ante el Ministerio de Educación y Cultura de España en 1997 (número de registro: Madrid 1-3-502)  y dedicada a investigar y difundir información acerca de condiciones de dolor.Otro porcentaje le será entregado a una persona que, durante los primeros meses de mi condición, antes de la llegada de mi mamá, se hizo cargo de mí y me ayudó a sobrellevar el dolor… una especie de “cadena de retribución”. La posible creación de un programa/fundación donde el arte sea fundamental en cualquier terapia destinada a restablecer la salud y la felicidad frente a cualquier condición. Por mi parte, me comprometo a hacer todo lo que esté a mi alcance para lograr una completa recuperación que me permita seguir mejorando y disfrutando de la vida durante los muchos años que me quedan por vivir… mi espíritu, mis pasiones y mi necesidad incesante de expresión estarán siempre agradecidos.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

Locca stands for the world’s smallest and most sophisticated tracking devices, which enables you to locate and communicate with everything and everyone that is equipped with this tiny device by using your smartphone/tablet (iOS/Android/Windows Phone) or web browser  -  internationally.

 Locca can be used in many different fields. We did extensive market research and identified these 5 categories that matter most to many people. 


 
When it comes to energy efficiency, Locca Locators are very intelligent, guaranteing a battery runtime of up to 1 month. So what’s our top secret to energy efficiency?  Thanks to our proprietary algorithm, Locca uses its advanced energy technology to offer exact locating and long battery runtime.

 During the first roll-out phase we have special contracts with telecommunication operators of most European countries, USA and Canada. The Locca location service for those countries is included in every Locca Pack!   To use the Locca devices in other regions than Europe, USA and Canada, you can purchase our individual country packages. We are working on getting special contracts with more countries. The coverage of our Locca Packs will therefore increase throughout 2015 (details will follow as update on indiegogo, on our website and social media sites).


In 2014 and 2015, the Locca Packs cover the following countries:Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Channel Islands, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Repulic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, French Guiana, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Isle of Man, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Martinique, Monaco, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Réunion, Romania, Saint-Barthélemy, Saint-Martin (French part), San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, USA. We created special packages for our indiegogo supporters, which include a LoccaMini or LoccaPhone device (depending on the pack), all accessories necessary for the specific field of application and the SIM card service fee for 6 months. Click on the perk to proceed directly to the check-out:






















All indiegogo perks include 6 months of service, i.e. we will charge you a monthly service fee only after the first 6 months of operation.There are two different fees, depending on whether you have a pack including a LoccaMini or LoccaPhone. The costs for LoccaPhone are higher, since our service covers not only data but also voice traffic.All supporters who want to buy more than 1 Locca Pack will get a special discount. The discount applies on your total monthly bill, no matter if you purchased only LoccaMinis, LoccaPhones or a combination of them.

You can easily pause the service with one click in the Locca app. You will not be charged when the service is on hold. Locca subscription is pre-paid, there is no service contract, no hidden fees and you can cancel anytime.All Locca devices have a built-in SIM card, similar to your mobile phone, because our world class location and communication services create data traffic (to use location service) for the LoccaMini and additional voice traffic (to make phone calls) for the LoccaPhone. For this communication and locating service we have to charge you a small monthly fee. The monthly fee is a flat rate service fee and includes unlimited locating service and up to 100 minutes of voice connection nationally. There are NO further roaming costs for data traffic!
 

For the last 2 years we have been working together with the best engineers, designers and software developers to create world class locators with an intuitive handling and that you can use for any field of application.We have fully functional prototypes of the LoccaMini and the smartphone apps for iOS, Android and Windows Phone will be available in the App Store soon.
 We are now ready for mass production of the LoccaMini (for pets, bike, stuff) and this requires us to raise money from the incredible IndieGoGo platform, which has helped many companies to successfully launch their products and services.We need to raise a minimum of  €75,000 ($100,000) to manufacture the first production run of LoccaMini.The LoccaPhone is not completely finished; as we focused our resources on LoccaMini during the last months, in order to quickly supply you with the first Locca products. Our engineers are currently working on the LoccaPhone prototype.

<p>Hi there, I'm James, and I'd love to tell you a little bit about myself and
Camp Lupine.<br/>
<br/>
I have been working in recreation for over 15 years and I love it.
Working in this setting has allowed me to combine my passion for recreation
with my love of working with people; it has allowed me to help patrons in the
pursuit of their interests and lead them to the discovery of new passions.  Now I want to seize the opportunity to pursue
my own passion and build something I can be proud of.<br/>
</p>
<p><b><span>What will my donation help you to achieve?</span></b>
</p><p><span>This campaign will help Camp Lupine become reality. It has been a dream
of mine for many years to open my own camp. I want to build a place where kids
can come have fun, feel safe and secure, and be willing to try new challenges.
Your contributions will help start up a camp that will be able to accommodate a
wide range of children and youth.  All kids will be welcome; Camp Lupine
will offer staff to assist children with special needs, and we will work with
lower income families to ensure their children can attend the camp and/or after

<p>Chronobiology is the study of everyday human activities and bodily processes such as hormone release, metabolic changes, cardiovascular activity and other processes, related to the natural body rhythm.</p>
<p>The AYO light gently enters your eyes, just like sunlight, and triggers retinal ganglion cells that send signals to your brain. AYO can tell your brain to “turn on” or “turn off,” no matter what the wall clock or your body clock says about the hour, the day or the time zone.</p>
<p>The signals from AYO can order your brain to, among other things, suppress its melatonin release, the hormone that makes you sleepy. The result: you’re rapidly more awake and energized, wherever in the world you may be! </p>

<p><b>SURPRISE STRECH GOAL - Unlocked as a special Christmas gift - AYO wireless charging </b></p>
<p>Our next generation wearable shouldn’t be hold back with messy wires and missing cables. Some of you have addressed those concerns and voiced the power-dock idea. Therefore, we have decided to give you all a special Christmas gift - wireless charging of AYO through the AYO case! The micro USB charging will be replaced and a wireless charging feature will be introduced instead! Charging wirelessly will make your Ayo more durable and much easier to use. </p>
<p><b>SPECIAL GIFT - Hard Carry Case part of the standard AYO package</b></p>
<p>Our initial idea was to create a special hard carry case as part of our Stretch goals. </p>
<p>During our user tests and following your comments we realized that a great carry case is essential and it should be an integral part of your AYO experience. With a thorough deliberation we decided to have a special carry case as a part of the standard AYO package – this means no extra cost for the backers and this feature is already unlocked! </p>
<p>$200,000 STRETCH GOAL ACHIEVED - A power bank battery will be integrated in the already promised AYO hard carry case. That means you will be able to charge your AYO on the go! </p>

They are just amazing!"" Nejc Slovnik, Slovenia ​""Every aspect of AYO, from the bottom-up, is seen as it was deeply thought about, designed, manufactured and delivered in the BEST possible way!"" Gal Schneor, Israel ​​""The best about AYO is its immediate effect! I usually arrive around 10 pm after an 8-hour long-haul flight. AYO helps me get the sleep I need to kick start the day and ""wow"" my clients."" Stoyan Petrov, UKand many more...The most innovative product to be sold on-board by Travel Blue and the Global Shopping Forum! AYO was internationally recognized by key influencers in the Travel Retail industry as a top innovation for solving the problem of jet lag. 



With AYO you are three simple steps away from more energy, better sleep, and less jet lag.


AYO is simple to set up and use - after creating a user profile in the AYO app based on your sleep habits and lifestyle preferences, our sophisticated algorithms perform an in-depth analysis calculating critical points for your sleep/wake routine and activity levels.
By wearing AYO in as little as 20 minutes a day, the clinically-backed AYO light can help you wake up easier while feeling more energized as well as alleviate jet lag or make you more active in the dark and evening hours, depending on the program you choose.
Due to the innovative and user-friendly design, you can use AYO while brushing your teeth, making breakfast, watching TV, reading the newspaper, checking your emails, etc. - it does not distract your eyesight in any way.
Most of our customers experience positive effects of AYO immediately or shortly after a session and are able reach their goals in three to seven days.Learn more about AYO and how it works on the video below! 
 

 
Do you keep snoozing the alarm? AYO can help you wake up naturally with a smile on your face. 
AYO sets your “biological alarm clock” so your body is ""fully charged"" at the start of a new day. AYO optimizes and adjusts your melatonin onset and offset to help you experience newfound energy and a natural & easy wake-up routine. 
AYO accomplishes this by finding out what your chronotype is (whether you are a morning person or an evening person) and helps you shift your body rhythm in the desired direction. 
Forget about pesky alarms, snoozing or tumbling in bed. AYO helps you actively optimize your sleep quality and habits. 
Find and set your natural sleep rhythm for brilliant, energizing sleep and a healthier, more productive time awake with AYO!
 

 
Traveling across 3 or more time zones? Then you are going to be jet lagged! As little as twenty minutes of “AYO” per day can help it go away!
Long-haul jet flights create jet lag: Tiredness and disorientation sometimes lasting for days after the flight, interfering with vacations or business trips.  
AYO helps our customers who are long-haul travelers adapt better to a new time zone by assessing their flight itinerary and sleep habits, and then providing guidance on the AYO usage.
On each trip, AYO customizes your AYO-wearing schedule, telling you when to wear the glasses to best adjust your internal body clock to the new time zone.  
No more sleepless nights, dozing off in meetings, stress or other jet lag symptoms. 
AYO is the long-distance traveler’s best friend and the technology behind AYO has been shown to help the long-distance travelers adapt to a new time zone 60% faster than usual. 
            
 

 
Forget the “power nap.” Take a 20-minute “power boost” instead!  
AYO boosts your energy and attention levels, enabling you to become more focused, rested and active. The unique blue light gently delivered by AYO to your eyes mimics the natural light of a sunny summer’s day, delivering extra bolts of energy along the way.  
When your energy dips anytime during the day or the night or winter season, take an “energy boost” with AYO.  For most, it’s a mood enhancer too!
 

AYO's proprietary technology is based on 20 years of Chronobiology research in leading universities around the world, including Harvard and Oxford.  
Chronobiology is the study of everyday human activities and bodily processes such as hormone release, metabolic changes, cardiovascular activity and other processes, related to the natural body rhythm.
The AYO light gently enters your eyes, just like sunlight, and triggers retinal ganglion cells that send signals to your brain. AYO can tell your brain to “turn on” or “turn off,” no matter what the wall clock or your body clock says about the hour, the day or the time zone.
The signals from AYO can order your brain to, among other things, suppress its melatonin release, the hormone that makes you sleepy. The result: you’re rapidly more awake and energized, wherever in the world you may be! 
To learn more about the science behind AYO, be sure to check out the video below and visit our science page:

AYO glasses are slim and minimalistic but also house a smart device that delivers insights you can use to enhance your energy and help you set your natural rhythm. 
Our easy-to-follow suggestions and simple steps help analyze your activity patterns and progress, enabling AYO to learn from your behavior, so each time you use AYO, the results progressively improve. 
Start with your current sleep and body rhythm. Adjust it to match your lifestyle. Then you’ll see the improvement you’re making with AYO.  The system makes things easy. It’s like having an “optimize” button for your brain!
AYO integrates sophisticated proprietary technology in circadian lighting into a wearable wellbeing tech, bundled in one great product with numerous amazing features! 
 

  



What happens when you put a visionary and a technology aficionado – Branislav, together with a fitness and nature enthusiast – Aleksandar? Both of them are frequent flyers and go-getters who ended up in the Netherlands during a dark and gloomy winter, doing their Master's program of Entrepreneurship.  
The result was an outrageous and amazing idea: a breakthrough innovation that would boost their energy, help them wake up naturally in the morning and travel the world without jet lag! 
Add to the mix one brilliant and experienced technology wiz – Nikola, supplement it all with the incredible support from leading experts and scientists in the field of Chronobiology and many awesomely passionate team members from various backgrounds.
Expose this community to major entrepreneurial mentors from the Netherlands, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, Kairos Society and Bob Dorf. Introduce them to the President of Philips Mr. Frans van Houten, Director of Innovation at KLM Mr. Rogier van Beugen, Dutch Prime minister Mr. Mark Rutte, Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands, Sonny Vu from MisFit wearables, World Tennis Player No.1 Novak Djokovic, Sir Richard Branson and many more game changers. 
Award them with cool international honors and provide them with guidance. Partner them up with a credible and experienced German product development and production company, and you will end up with AYO – a next generation visionary wearable.
AYO is the result of three years of development and wonderful support of experts and enthusiasts. We are very grateful that we managed to come this far and hope that with your help we can finish what we started and let you enjoy AYO in no time!


When we designed AYO, we put special attention to all the details. We are proud to say that we have spent thousands of hours on iterations and improvements that makes AYO an amazing device!
In the last 3 years, we have gone through numerous prototype versions of AYO. AYO's smart algorithm has been developed with close attention to in-depth knowledge of Chronobiology and light treatment, and we are especially pleased of its ability to make custom programs for each individual user, as well as being able to adapt over time and get better with continued usage.
We are already in production and have delivered the orders to the majority of our loyal backers! The remaining orders as well as the future ones are being delivered in May 2017. We are currently in the process of finalizing the deliveries to the rest of our backers and at the same time, we are warmly welcoming the invaluable feedback from our current users and customers who help us make AYO better and more awesome!

       FIRST STRETCH GOAL of $ 100,000 COMPLETED - ChronoJump app feature will be included!Our first stretch goal is reached! And ChronoJump app feature is now a fact. This smart addition to our AYO app can help you achieve a custom and fast temporary internal rhythm shift or make sure you are at your peak at the specific moment in time. For instance, you want to catch a live TV broadcast in the middle of the night or be at your top performance for a specific sport activity, etc. Basically by syncing your circadian rhythm you are jumping in the desired state for a day!
SURPRISE STRECH GOAL - Unlocked as a special Christmas gift - AYO wireless charging 
Our next generation wearable shouldn’t be hold back with messy wires and missing cables. Some of you have addressed those concerns and voiced the power-dock idea. Therefore, we have decided to give you all a special Christmas gift - wireless charging of AYO through the AYO case! The micro USB charging will be replaced and a wireless charging feature will be introduced instead! Charging wirelessly will make your Ayo more durable and much easier to use. 
SPECIAL GIFT - Hard Carry Case part of the standard AYO package
Our initial idea was to create a special hard carry case as part of our Stretch goals. 
During our user tests and following your comments we realized that a great carry case is essential and it should be an integral part of your AYO experience. With a thorough deliberation we decided to have a special carry case as a part of the standard AYO package – this means no extra cost for the backers and this feature is already unlocked! 
$200,000 STRETCH GOAL ACHIEVED - A power bank battery will be integrated in the already promised AYO hard carry case. That means you will be able to charge your AYO on the go! 
Have a look at it in the Gallery. 

                         
                             
Usage
When do I need to wear AYO?
AYO App will provide you with the specific time of usage that in most situations correspond to your mornings or evenings, depending on the program you have chosen.
Do I need to wear AYO with opened or closed eyes?
Use AYO with your eyes open and it will not interfere with your vision. Using AYO with open eyes  is completely safe.
How long do I need to wear AYO in order to feel an effect? 
It depends on the program you select and your desired effect. In case of the Energy program, you can start feeling the effect of AYO in as little as 20 minutes of usage.
Safety and the science behind AYO
How does it actually work? 
AYO uses sophisticated light treatment to optimize your master body clock based on an in-depth knowledge of Chronobiology. For more information please have a look at: http://goayo.com/benefits.html
Is it safe for the eyes? 
Yes, AYO is considered to be very safe for your eyes. Actually, it is safer than the light you get from the Sun everyday, as it does not use any of the harmful UV or Infrared lights.
Furthermore, AYO has been certified for photo biological safety by an international regulatory body.  
What are the clinical proofs behind the technology used in AYO?
AYO technology is based on proven and tested light treatment solutions and industry standards. Furthermore, we are in the process of conducting exciting clinical trials with AYO! 
General 
How long will it take until I notice the effect on my wellbeing?  
It usually takes around 3 to 7 days to feel the positive effects of AYO. However, some short-term effects can sometimes be felt right after the usage.
I have heard of light treatment before. How is AYO different? 
AYO innovates light treatment in a few key areas. AYO is the most sophisticated light treatment solution: it provides a personalized approach that is crucial for the efficiency. It is easy to use thanks to the AYO app and it minimizes glare while maintaining effectiveness. Last but not least, it’s packed with amazing features, never seen before in a light treatment solution.
What system will the AYO App support?
AYO App is available for downloading both on the App Store and Google Play. 
Product development and delivery
When will I get my AYO? 
 A good part of the AYOs to all our backers have already been delivered successfully. We are planning to finalize the deliveries to the rest of our current and new backers later this month and next month.  
What materials are the glasses made of? 
The AYO glasses are made of high-quality plastic materials.
Can I get it in different colors/materials? 
We currently plan to have AYO in one color pattern: white-blue. Press & Media

By offering kids classes in a group fitness setting on the SURFSET Boards, we are teaching kids at a young age the benefits of being active and staying healthy. With obesity on the rise in children it's our job to show them the way to take care of their bodies. At On Point Body our focus will be to educate and have fun, which is something I know parents will get behind. We plan to offer 2 classes a week for kids.

Great for the community!
Our local area truly needs a business like this. I know this studio will build relationships, have a community feel, and be a comfortable place to re-energize your body and mind. Upbeat music and a clean stylish atmosphere will make this spot a place everyone will want to come and experience.
Your support is going to make my dream of helping people feel and look their best come to life!

Help create a revolution in the we organize health research to make it easily accessible and organized for all to create new connections and knowledge. </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","LIGHT - Social HighlightingMy name is Steve Scott. I am the founder of LIGHT and CarbogeneticsCurrently there are many users of LIGHT and a lot of people find it beneficial. LIGHT is a social search engine designed to allow people to find the best parts of the internet. The focus on this project is to make this tool into a premiere research tool for health and wellness. And also to introduce the social aspect which really gives the tool it's power. Collectively finding the best research and organizing it to make it much more useful and easy to find.Here is how the LIGHT search engine currently works 

 
Funding Level 1: Convert Ray Peat Newsletters to Digital (Total Backed: $2,000)There is approximately 35 years of newsletters which have not been put in digital format. Each newsletter is on average 6 pages. It is estimated to about around 1,200 pages. So we will convert each newsletter to text and triple check the content. Each newsletter will be delivered back to Ray Peat in HTML and PDF format. Also each article will be indexed into the LIGHT search engine. Dr Ray Peat will be sending me the newsletters.Funding Level 2: Bud Weiss Interviews with Ray Peat (Total Backed: $7,000)Over many years Bud Weiss has conducted approximately 40 hours of interviews with Ray Peat. Once he is done editing them he will post on Youtube and send to me for transcribing. Each word will be time-stamped and indexed to the search engine to find easily.These interviews are chock full of great information about CO2 and other health related information that have not been made public before.Funding Level 3: Generative Energy Podcasts by Danny Roddy (Total Backed: $10,000)There are approximately 31 hours of podcast material which will be transcribed, triple checked, and time-stamped. It will then be indexed to the LIGHT search engine to make it easy to find. These interviews are a great source of health and physiological information including interviews with Ray Peat, Georgi, Karen Mcc and more.  Funding Level 4: Giving Back to Ray Peat (Total Backed: $12,000)For all the work Dr Peat has done and the graciousness in which he makes his work available to everyone, I want to give back to him. We will give him a CO2 Breathing Machine, CO2 Therapy Bath, Capnometer and a Red Light Man device. Funding Level 5: Improve LIGHT Features (Total Backed: $17,000)Currently you can highlight material as you are reading it. The new features will allow you to highlight multiple parts of the page at the same time and have it indexed into the search engine all at once. We will also be adding better sharing features for highlights, text, audio and videos. It will allow you to choose the text font, background image and more when sharing.We come across so much health information each day that it's hard to find and organize the best we come across. You will be able to find and organize your own highlights as well as those from others. You can create groups of like minded individuals as well as create projects within groups to help find the best information from a collectively united group of people.Funding Level 6: LIGHT RESEARCH (Total Backed: $27,000)LIGHT RESEARCH is a social research engine allowing users to create Statements and provide studies that support or do not support the statement. Users will be enabled to vote if the study supports or does not support. Additionally comments will be allowed under each study to discuss. All studies will be classified by type of study and if animal or human. This will allow people to search for virtually any topic and see what research has been done on it and find it all in one place.  You can also see which statements are supported by individual studies and also see what other studies the authors have conducted. In the search above you can see all studies regarding ""emodin"". You can filter between human and animal studies as well. Funding Level 7: LIGHT SOCIAL (Total Backed: $47,000)Level 7 is what brings it all together. People will be able to create pages and groups. With your user account you will be able to create your own profile page. You will be able to comment on studies, create your own highlights associated with your account, mark if a study supports the statement or does not.Additionally you'll be able to create Groups. Groups allows like minded individuals to come together and find information together. You will also be able to create projects around certain topics. All information highlighted by Groups and Individuals is publicly available to search. The advantage is that you are able to filter by Users and Groups. So if you want to follow a group or individual and see what they are highlighting you are able to.Levels of FinancingAll levels of financing will produce something unique valuable. No matter how much is financed, part of the project will be completed and you will find it tremendously valuable. If more money is raised than the $47,000 then that money will go into transcribing, time-stamping every word, and indexing other popular health podcasts. Every $ raised will add valuable to an already valuable search platform. Health blogger and research Danny Roddy has said:Steven Scott's Ray Peat search engine is pretty phenomenal. The ability to search Ray's audio interviews for interesting keywords is one of the most useful research tools I've come across.Bud Weiss, founder of Buteyko New York City has said:""Wow. I'm absolutely overwhelmed both by your incredible dedication to bringing this work forward and making it so much more researchable and to your extraordinary generosity. You deserve so much recognition for doing this and making research and teaching with this a kind of dream all of us who are serious about it would wish for and here you are doing it.

The patch combines light therapy with cutting-edge nanotechnology to provide immediate and long-lasting health benefits.            Taopatch uses a mixture of nanotechnology ingredients, specifically nanocrystals called Quantum Dots to facilitate light therapy, similar to low-level laser therapy. Taopatch contains layers of these Quantum Dots, 10,000 times smaller than human hair.      These Quantum Dots have the capability of being photosensitive and are activated by infrared wavelengths of light naturally emitted from our body. Taopatch converts infrared energy into specific therapeutic wavelengths of light (it actually glows in the dark).   Taopatch uses light therapy, similar to low-level laser therapy and sun exposure, to make you feel better and more balanced than ever before.   The photons released by Taopatch are similar to the biophotons our nerve cells use to communicate with each other as shown by Dr. Fritz Albert Popp in 1972. This light is sent into specific acupuncture points on your body, which helps your nervous system “remember” how to naturally communicate with the rest of your body. It also works like a light supplement for your body, your brain and your cells.     Taopatch is very easy to apply. Each package comes with medical-grade, waterproof, hypoallergenic and breathable adhesives to apply Taopatch to your skin. You can also use medical skin tape or bandages. Your Taopatch will include detailed instructions for you to reference as you apply it to specific acupoints on your body.       Taopatch was created by an Italian biomedical scientist Fabio Fontana.

Flöckbud is a location-based workout finder for people with similar fitness goals.

</ul><div data-id=""15651317""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div></div>","Welcome to Raybaby, the world's first and only non-contact sleep and breathing tracker, created for moms and dads to bring in that much needed sanity in their lives. Supported by Johnson & Johnson, and HAX as part of the Joint Consumer Health Device Program, Raybaby safely monitors vitals, breathing rates and sleeping habits all from a 'Smart Journal' app while even making recommendations to improve the baby's sleep...and yours! Raybaby is suitable for infants and toddlers (0-3 years of age)    The need for Raybaby arose from you, either a parent of the 21st century, or well-wishers of one. Juggling a world of responsibilities and careers, along with trying to raise a happy, healthy baby is no mean feat. Wonderful, yet exhausting.But sometimes new parents tend to forget just how much path-breaking technology can ease up their lives. And we're here to do exactly that. To help you look beyond baby monitors and toys. To be non-invasive, precise, and adapt tech that even the grandparents would be cool with. :) And we'd love to show you how!
Through a technology that works on the principles of ultrasound, it NOTIFIES you when the baby is running a fever

Recognizes warning signs and instantly send alerts
Observes even minute variations if baby has any sort of respiratory illnesses or allergy attacks like Bronchitis or Asthma

Tells you how much your baby has slept 
And how much he/she needs to sleep
Alerts when the baby wakes up or rolls over

Our sleep recommendation system will help with sleep training of babies
 Raybaby builds up a picture and video collage of your baby's most precious moments. So the next time family and friends come over, you can just show them the very first time he said ""Da-da."" :)We know how much new moms and dads wish they could constantly keep in touch with their little one - constant reassurance of a parent's voice is an important part of his/her development. Raybaby comes equipped with integrated Infrared video camera which enables live video streaming even in pitch darkness, built in speakers, and audio monitoring that uses a highly sensitive microphone.
Indicates current mood of the baby
Comprehensive, easy to use information
Provides helpful tips and recommendations
 New parents getting time to themselves? A miracle. Remember the last time you baked a cake? Did yoga? Went for date night without being constantly anxious? Raybaby wants to change that narrative. Being a parent need not always be supremely stressful. Now you can focus on what really matters, while Raybaby watches over your bundle of joy. Built on an unparalleled AI platform, Raybaby is intuitive and molded to junior's sleep pattern and respiration. Behind the simple interface is a powerful algorithm that keeps you up-to-date on your baby's REM requirements, and even offers recommendations on how to ensure that her development can be optimized. You've put weeks of effort into the baby room, handpicked the cotton and matched the stuffed toys. Everything looks perfect. So why would you bring home a clunky baby monitor that stands out sore?Raybaby has been designed keeping in mind your tastes; inconspicuous, single-wired, and might we say - even elegant. :) With the decision to eliminate harmful batteries, comes the question of emergencies during power failures. Fear not; Raybaby comes with a built in power backup which will last for 3+ hours of operation. Coupled with local connectivity over WIFI/Bluetooth 4.0, and GSM-voice/SMS remote notification feature, you will never be more than a simple tap away from seeing what your baby is up to.   We know that most backers won't have the opportunity to experience Raybaby before pledging, but we are confident that you are going to love Raybaby. We will reward your faith in us by offering a 30-day money back guarantee. It’s simple. If you don’t think Raybaby is helping your baby or you, send them back within 30-days for a full refund.     Why, of course.

Er ist der kleinste &amp; günstigste AED (automatischer externer Defibrillator) und ist mit deinem Handy verbunden. Du kannst ihn in deinem Rucksack oder in deiner Tasche bei dir tragen, damit du immer &amp; überall für den Notfall vorbereitet bist. Dein Handy gibt dir rechtzeitig Bescheid, wenn der Akku geladen, oder die Elektroden erneuert werden müssen.</p><p><strong>Mit welcher Technologie werden die Schock-Impulse von PocketDefi abgegeben?</strong><br/>Die Schocks von PocketDefi werden biphasisch verabreicht.<br/>Im Gegensatz zur monophasischen Defibrillation fließt der Strom dabei in eine Richtung durch das Herz, wird dort umgekehrt und fließt dann in die Gegenrichtung. Die biphasische Defibrillation hat den Vorteil, dass viel weniger Energie nötig und dadurch die Wahrscheinlichkeit einer Schädigung des Herzmuskels kleiner ist.</p><p><strong>Erkennt PocketDefi automatisch, ob eine Schockabgabe erforderlich ist?</strong><br/>Ja, PocketDefi erkennt automatisch, ob eine Schockabgabe erforderlich ist.<br/>PocketDefi ist ein automatisierter externer Defibrillator (AED). Geräte dieser Art werten Herzrhythmen selbstständig aus und schlagen bei Bedarf eine Schockabgabe vor. PocketDefi ist ein Halbautomat – was bedeutet, dass die Schockabgabe durch einen Tastendruck durch den Anwender erfolgt.</p><p><strong>Wie viele Schocks kann PocketDefi abgeben?</strong><br/>Die Anzahl der Schocks, die ein Defi abgeben können muss, ist durch medizintechnische Normen geregelt. Sie besagen, dass ein Defi in der Lage sein muss, mindestens 20 Schocks abzugeben. An genau diese Vorgaben muss sich natürlich auch PocketDefi halten. In der Regel sind aber für eine erfolgreiche Defibrillation nur wenige Schocks erforderlich.</p><p><strong>Kann PocketDefi auch an Kindern angewandt werden?</strong><br/>Plötzliches Herzversagen außerhalb vom Krankenhaus ist bei Kindern extrem selten. Für die erste Version von PocketDefi konzentrieren wir uns darauf, zuerst die wahrscheinlichsten Fälle abzudecken, planen aber für eine spätere Version eine Lösung für die Defibrillation von Kindern.</p><p><strong>App-Abo - Was kostet dies nach Ablauf der 2 gratis Jahre?</strong><br/>Die Besonderheit von PocketDefi liegt darin, über die Smartphone App die laufende Wartung durchzuführen. Damit ist es nicht mehr zwingend notwendig, dass ein Servicemitarbeiter vorbeikommt um das Gerät auszulesen. Mittels deines Smartphones und der dazugehörigen App kann das automatisch erfolgen. Dieses App-Abo wird sich in einem sehr niedrigen Preisbereich bewegen und nur € 1-2 pro Monat ausmachen.<br/>Zusätzlich wird es noch andere kostenpflichtige Optionen der App geben. Diese erinnern zB an den rechtzeitigen Tausch der Elektroden etc. Die App selbst ist aber nicht Voraussetzung für die Verwendung des PocketDefi. Auch im Notfall ist dein Smartphone für die Schockabgabe nicht notwendig.</p><p><strong>Was kosten die Elektroden?</strong><br/>Der Preis steht noch nicht endgültig fest, wird aber - wie bei anderen Laiendefis auch - in etwa zwischen € 50 und € 100 betragen.</p><p><strong>Welche Wartungen sind erforderlich?</strong><br/>Ein Großteil der Wartung wird über die dazugehörige App erfolgen. Davon merkst du nichts, denn diese wird automatisch von uns durchgeführt. Die Elektroden sind nach Ablauf des Haltbarkeitsdatums oder nach Gebrauch zu ersetzen. Der Akku muss nicht wie bei anderen Geräten regelmäßig getauscht werden, da dieser aufladbar ist. Dafür ist im Basispaket die induktive Ladeplattform enthalten. </p><p><strong>Welche Wartungskosten fallen an?</strong><br/>Im Gegensatz zu den meisten herkömmlichen AEDs, kann PocketDefi aufgeladen werden. Das bedeutet, dass der ansonsten teure Batterietausch wegfällt. Somit ist das Gerät im laufenden Betrieb nicht nur viel günstiger sondern auch wesentlich nachhaltiger. Die Elektroden sind nach Ablauf des Haltbarkeitsdatums oder nach Gebrauch zu ersetzen. Der Preis der Ersatzelektroden wurde noch nicht finalisiert - bewegt sich aber im Bereich von 50-100 € pro Paar.</p><p>Was die laufende Kontrolle und Wartung betrifft, so ist es bei PocketDefi möglich, den Zustand des Geräts bzw. der Software über die Smartphone-App auslesen zu lassen. Somit muss kein Servicetechniker mehr vor Ort sein, um dein Gerät zu überprüfen. Für diese “Fernwartung” wird es ein App-Abo geben. Dieses ist die ersten beiden Jahre im Verkaufspreis inbegriffen. Danach wird der Preis für die Basisversion in etwa € 1-2 pro Monat betragen.</p><p><strong>Warum hat PocketDefi keinen Bildschirm?</strong><br/>PocketDefi ist für eine möglichst rasche Anwendung konzipiert, weshalb wir uns für ein schlichtes &amp; intuitives Design entschieden haben. Ein Bildschirm würde die kleine Baugröße außerdem unmöglich machen.</p><p><strong>Was kostet die Ladeplattform extra?</strong><br/>Die Ladeplattform wird es extra vorerst nicht zu kaufen geben. Später, nach der Markteinführung in 2018 kann sich das durchaus ändern.</p><p><strong>Gibt es ein Trainingsgerät?</strong><br/>Zunächst werden wir das Echt-Gerät durch die Zulassung führen. Damit sind wir sicher gut beschäftigt. Eine Möglichkeit mit PocketDefi zu trainieren, ist uns aber auch wichtig, und wird es in Zukunft sicher geben.</p><p><strong>Warum beträgt die maximale Defibrillationsenergie 150 Joule?</strong><br/>Die Schockabgabe erfolgt grundsätzlich biphasisch, da diese Art des Impulses als sicher und effektiv gilt. Genaue Details können wir zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt noch nicht bekannt geben. Wir arbeiten bei diesem Thema mit Universitäten zusammen und betreiben selbst Forschung. Eine neuartige Pulsform ermöglicht es, mit geringer Energieabgabe eine erfolgreiche Wiederbelebung durchzuführen.<br/>Die Leitlinien geben je nach Impulsform unterschiedliche Empfehlungen für die zu verwendende Energie ab, wobei jedoch angemerkt wird, dass optimale Energiestufen nicht bekannt sind. Für den ersten Schock soll die Energie zwischen 120 und 150 Joule liegen. Für den zweiten und nachfolgende Schocks ist nicht klar, ob eine gesteigerte Energie zu bevorzugen ist. Auf jeden Fall ist es für den Patienten am besten, die abgegebene Energie auf den Körperwiderstand abzustimmen. Fazit: PocketDefi passt den Schockimpuls an den Patienten an und vermeidet Schäden durch eine zu hohe Schockenergie.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Wurde deine Frage noch nicht beantwortet?</h2><p style=""text-align: center;"">Benutze doch die Kommentar-Funktion um deine Frage an uns zu stellen.

Ist keine normale Atmung und kein Puls feststellbar, müssen sofort Reanimationsmaßnahmen (Herzdruckmassage & Defibrillation) durchgeführt werden.Um eine Unterversorgung der Organe und somit Folgeschäden zu vermeiden, ist eine Defibrillation in den ersten 3 Minuten notwendig. Nach Auftreten eines Kreislaufstillstandes sinkt die Überlebenschance nämlich pro Minute um etwa 10%.Im städtischen Raum beträgt die durchschnittliche Zeit vom Absetzen eines Notrufes, bis zum Eintreffen der Rettungskräfte 12 bis 15 Minuten. Um diese Zeit zu überbrücken, wurden in den letzten Jahren Laiendefibrillatoren an öffentlichen Plätzen und in Institutionen (Banken, Spitäler, Gemeindeämter, usw.) platziert. Erleidet jemand einen Kreislaufstillstand, können diese Defis von dort geholt und zum Unfallort gebracht werden.Da der nächstgelegener Defi-Standort meist unbekannt ist, werden die Defis oft nicht, oder nicht rechtzeitig gefunden. Würde man aber einen eigenen Defi im Rucksack bei sich tragen, könnte man diese wertvolle Zeit reduzieren & jährlich weltweit etwa 17 Millionen Menschen rechtzeitig helfen. So kannst du uns helfenProjektstatusWas wir bisher erreicht haben, und noch erreichen wollen: So verwenden wir deinen BeitragUnser gemeinsames erstes großes Ziel sind € 100.000. Mit diesem Betrag werden wir das Zulassungsverfahren für Medizinprodukte vorbereiten und die Serienüberleitung starten.Doch das ist erst der Anfang - wir haben noch viel mehr vor: Übersicht der limitierten Pakete Das sind wirDas PocketDefi-Team besteht aus 7 klugen Köpfen aus den Bereichen Hardware- & Software-Entwicklung bzw. Marketing. Die meisten von uns haben ein medizintechnisches Studium als Grundlage, und sind damit für die Entwicklung des PocketDefi bestens gerüstet. Als zum Teil  ehemalige Zivildiener und Sanitäter, ist uns das Retten von Leben ein großes Anliegen.  Experten über PocketDefi PartnerPresse  AwardsFördergeberFAQsWie funktioniert PocketDefi?PocketDefi ist ein Laiendefibrillator. Er ist der kleinste & günstigste AED (automatischer externer Defibrillator) und ist mit deinem Handy verbunden. Du kannst ihn in deinem Rucksack oder in deiner Tasche bei dir tragen, damit du immer & überall für den Notfall vorbereitet bist. Dein Handy gibt dir rechtzeitig Bescheid, wenn der Akku geladen, oder die Elektroden erneuert werden müssen.Mit welcher Technologie werden die Schock-Impulse von PocketDefi abgegeben?Die Schocks von PocketDefi werden biphasisch verabreicht.Im Gegensatz zur monophasischen Defibrillation fließt der Strom dabei in eine Richtung durch das Herz, wird dort umgekehrt und fließt dann in die Gegenrichtung. Die biphasische Defibrillation hat den Vorteil, dass viel weniger Energie nötig und dadurch die Wahrscheinlichkeit einer Schädigung des Herzmuskels kleiner ist.Erkennt PocketDefi automatisch, ob eine Schockabgabe erforderlich ist?Ja, PocketDefi erkennt automatisch, ob eine Schockabgabe erforderlich ist.PocketDefi ist ein automatisierter externer Defibrillator (AED). Geräte dieser Art werten Herzrhythmen selbstständig aus und schlagen bei Bedarf eine Schockabgabe vor. PocketDefi ist ein Halbautomat – was bedeutet, dass die Schockabgabe durch einen Tastendruck durch den Anwender erfolgt.Wie viele Schocks kann PocketDefi abgeben?Die Anzahl der Schocks, die ein Defi abgeben können muss, ist durch medizintechnische Normen geregelt. Sie besagen, dass ein Defi in der Lage sein muss, mindestens 20 Schocks abzugeben. An genau diese Vorgaben muss sich natürlich auch PocketDefi halten. In der Regel sind aber für eine erfolgreiche Defibrillation nur wenige Schocks erforderlich.Kann PocketDefi auch an Kindern angewandt werden?Plötzliches Herzversagen außerhalb vom Krankenhaus ist bei Kindern extrem selten. Für die erste Version von PocketDefi konzentrieren wir uns darauf, zuerst die wahrscheinlichsten Fälle abzudecken, planen aber für eine spätere Version eine Lösung für die Defibrillation von Kindern.App-Abo - Was kostet dies nach Ablauf der 2 gratis Jahre?Die Besonderheit von PocketDefi liegt darin, über die Smartphone App die laufende Wartung durchzuführen. Damit ist es nicht mehr zwingend notwendig, dass ein Servicemitarbeiter vorbeikommt um das Gerät auszulesen. Mittels deines Smartphones und der dazugehörigen App kann das automatisch erfolgen. Dieses App-Abo wird sich in einem sehr niedrigen Preisbereich bewegen und nur € 1-2 pro Monat ausmachen.Zusätzlich wird es noch andere kostenpflichtige Optionen der App geben. Diese erinnern zB an den rechtzeitigen Tausch der Elektroden etc. Die App selbst ist aber nicht Voraussetzung für die Verwendung des PocketDefi. Auch im Notfall ist dein Smartphone für die Schockabgabe nicht notwendig.Was kosten die Elektroden?Der Preis steht noch nicht endgültig fest, wird aber - wie bei anderen Laiendefis auch - in etwa zwischen € 50 und € 100 betragen.Welche Wartungen sind erforderlich?Ein Großteil der Wartung wird über die dazugehörige App erfolgen. Davon merkst du nichts, denn diese wird automatisch von uns durchgeführt. Die Elektroden sind nach Ablauf des Haltbarkeitsdatums oder nach Gebrauch zu ersetzen. Der Akku muss nicht wie bei anderen Geräten regelmäßig getauscht werden, da dieser aufladbar ist. Dafür ist im Basispaket die induktive Ladeplattform enthalten. Welche Wartungskosten fallen an?Im Gegensatz zu den meisten herkömmlichen AEDs, kann PocketDefi aufgeladen werden. Das bedeutet, dass der ansonsten teure Batterietausch wegfällt. Somit ist das Gerät im laufenden Betrieb nicht nur viel günstiger sondern auch wesentlich nachhaltiger. Die Elektroden sind nach Ablauf des Haltbarkeitsdatums oder nach Gebrauch zu ersetzen. Der Preis der Ersatzelektroden wurde noch nicht finalisiert - bewegt sich aber im Bereich von 50-100 € pro Paar.Was die laufende Kontrolle und Wartung betrifft, so ist es bei PocketDefi möglich, den Zustand des Geräts bzw. der Software über die Smartphone-App auslesen zu lassen. Somit muss kein Servicetechniker mehr vor Ort sein, um dein Gerät zu überprüfen. Für diese “Fernwartung” wird es ein App-Abo geben. Dieses ist die ersten beiden Jahre im Verkaufspreis inbegriffen. Danach wird der Preis für die Basisversion in etwa € 1-2 pro Monat betragen.Warum hat PocketDefi keinen Bildschirm?PocketDefi ist für eine möglichst rasche Anwendung konzipiert, weshalb wir uns für ein schlichtes & intuitives Design entschieden haben. Ein Bildschirm würde die kleine Baugröße außerdem unmöglich machen.Was kostet die Ladeplattform extra?Die Ladeplattform wird es extra vorerst nicht zu kaufen geben. Später, nach der Markteinführung in 2018 kann sich das durchaus ändern.Gibt es ein Trainingsgerät?Zunächst werden wir das Echt-Gerät durch die Zulassung führen. Damit sind wir sicher gut beschäftigt. Eine Möglichkeit mit PocketDefi zu trainieren, ist uns aber auch wichtig, und wird es in Zukunft sicher geben.Warum beträgt die maximale Defibrillationsenergie 150 Joule?Die Schockabgabe erfolgt grundsätzlich biphasisch, da diese Art des Impulses als sicher und effektiv gilt. Genaue Details können wir zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt noch nicht bekannt geben. Wir arbeiten bei diesem Thema mit Universitäten zusammen und betreiben selbst Forschung. Eine neuartige Pulsform ermöglicht es, mit geringer Energieabgabe eine erfolgreiche Wiederbelebung durchzuführen.Die Leitlinien geben je nach Impulsform unterschiedliche Empfehlungen für die zu verwendende Energie ab, wobei jedoch angemerkt wird, dass optimale Energiestufen nicht bekannt sind. Für den ersten Schock soll die Energie zwischen 120 und 150 Joule liegen. Für den zweiten und nachfolgende Schocks ist nicht klar, ob eine gesteigerte Energie zu bevorzugen ist. Auf jeden Fall ist es für den Patienten am besten, die abgegebene Energie auf den Körperwiderstand abzustimmen. Fazit: PocketDefi passt den Schockimpuls an den Patienten an und vermeidet Schäden durch eine zu hohe Schockenergie.Wurde deine Frage noch nicht beantwortet?Benutze doch die Kommentar-Funktion um deine Frage an uns zu stellen.

This way PocketDefi is always ready at hand in your backpack or purse, so you can save lives any place and any time.affordableThe cost of PocketDefi is about 60% lower compared to common defibrillators. Therefore, PocketDefi is the first lay defibrillator you can afford personally.safe and simpleThe PocketDefi software will check if a shock is needed all by itself. Then  you can save lives by pushing the button. The plain design allows an intuitional handling of PocketDefi.smartphone connectionThe connection to your smartphone reduces maintenance. The app checks if your PocketDefi is all right and if it’s ready for use. Through messages on your smartphone you will notice if your assistance is required. In case of an emergency PocketDefi will work without your smartphone. Components and PackagesBaseThe base consists out of a basic module and a package of electrodes. After expiry or use the package of electrodes has to be exchanged for a new one.ChargerWith the inductive charger you can charge your PocketDefi very easily. Thus, the costly exchange of batteries is obsolete. This is not only good for your budget, but also for the environment. The battery is designed to have enough power to defibrillate multiple times, even after 30 days in standby mode. PocketDefi App – support aside emergenciesWith the PocketDefi App we service your device over the air. Therefore, we will recognise if your PocketDefi is ready for use, if an Update is needed or if electrodes need to be exchanged.Additionally, we intend to develop a Proximity Alert. This will offer you the possibility to notify other first aiders with PocketDefis in case of an emergency, if you’re not carrying your device with you. To provide this feature, we have to reach the funding goal of €350.000,-, for which we need your help. The way PocketDefi worksPocketDefi is easy to handle for everybody
After taking the lid off, the voice support starts to give instructions
Take the electrodes out of the package.

Apply the electrodes on the patient’s chest as shown in the picture.
The device will perform an analysis and will recommend to apply a shock if needed. Push the button if requested.
After use, the electrodes have to be replaced.

  What’s the need forlay defibillators?In case of cardiac arrest immediate first aid is needed. If neither normal breathing nor heart rate can be detected, resuscitation (CPR) has to be performed immediately.To avoid a critical shortage of oxygen in organs, and therefore permanent injuries, defibrillation within the first 3 minutes is necessary. In cases of cardiac arrest chances of survival diminish 10% per minute.In urban regions, the average time between the emergency call and the emergency forces to arrive is 12 to 15 minutes. To fill this gap, lay defibrillators have been placed in public places and institutions (banks, hospitals, community offices, etc). In cases of cardiac arrest, these defibrillators can be retrieved to the emergency. Because the position of the next defibrillator is mostly unknown, defibrillators are often not found, or retrieved in time. Would the first aider carry his/her own defibrillator in his bag pack or purse, valuable time could be saved and 17 million people worldwide could be saved each year.This is how you can contributeProject statusMilestones we have achieved, and ones we are aiming for: This is how we will use your contributionOur first major collective goal will be reaching €100.000,-. With this amount we will prepare for medical authorisation and initiate serial production.But that’s just the start – we have a lot more to achieve: Overview of limited Packages This is usTeam-PocketDefi consists of 7 bright young people coming from hardware & software development as well as marketing.

<p>Founder Hans Brouwer — a product developer with over 25 years of experience — conceived the idea of creating a 'new' alarm clock years ago. While working on other projects it kept popping up in his mind. Together with Grinn, a partnering technology development company in Wroclaw, Poland he created the first functional prototype back in 2014. </p>
<p>At the end 2016 he got in contact with Robert Bronwasser and Yannick Brouwer to develop form and functionality in what would eventually become Circa. In April '17, Daan Weijers joined the team, and the team continued developing what Circa is today; <i>a beautiful alarm clock that helps you to sleep better</i>!</p>

</div></div>","More than 60% of people use their smartphone to wake up in the morning. However, we often find ourselves scrolling through our timelines late at night, and get sucked into our phones before starting the day.Circa wants to change that.Circa is a stand-alone device designed to help you sleep better, while offering less distractions. With every clock, a sleep-sensor is included. The sensor lives under your mattress, and allows circa to analyse your sleep and determine in what sleep-stage you are in. This way, Circa can be intelligent about waking you up and provide you with insights and actionable feedback that can actually help you with your sleeping habits.   Where the smartphone is designed to do hundreds of different things well, Circa is designed to be great at one thing: helping you sleep better!Smart alarmCirca features a thin sensor underneath your mattress that measures your movement and respiration to understand your sleep cycles. Normal alarms wake you up on a fixed time, no matter what. In a timeframe of 30 minutes before your alarm is set, Circa will find the best time to wake you up in your light sleep. This way, you’ll wake up easier and more refreshed in the morning.Put Circa's sleep-sensor underneath your mattress once and never think about it again.
 
Insights


A lot of “smart” sleep products provide you with an arbitrary sleep score and graphs about single nights. Although fun at first, they do not provide actionable feedback to improve your sleep in the long run. Circa collects data over multiple nights, to provide you with insights and feedback that help you to adjust and improve your routine.
Circa provides you with long-term insights and actionable feedback on the device itself.
 
Coaching
In order to make it easier to keep your routine, Circa can send you a friendly reminder on your phone when it’s time to go to bed. 

Soothing sounds 
Fall asleep with soothing sounds like whistling birds, trees blowing in the wind or ocean waves. 


White, pink or brown noise 
Circa can provide you with white, pink or brown noise to shift your focus. The constant layer of sound works like a muffling blanket that masks disturbances in your environment like ticking radiators, dripping faucets and outside noise.


Breathing Assistant 
Circa’s Breathing Assistant emits a slowly pulsing light. Slow down your breath by closing your eyes and following the light to calm your body down before sleep.

 

Wake up with your favorite sounds and music 
Circa features a carefully designed audio system that makes your music and alarms sound rich and clear. Wake up with beautiful alarm sounds, nature sound or your favorite music.

 
Circa has DAB+, HD Radio and Internet Radio inside to listen to your favorite stations from around the world and with Spotify inside you can listen to your favorite artists and playlists.

 
Waking up comfortably with the Internet of Things 

 
Circa can connect to your smart home using Triggi. Connect Circa to your connected lights to slowly light up your room or let your thermostat start making your home comfortable based on your waking time. You can use the Triggi app on your phone to link Circa to more connected things.

  

Never not waking up 
When you turn off the light, Circa will quickly reassure you that an alarm has been set. Because of the backup battery, it will always wake you up, even if the power is down.

 
Dark screen 
Circa features an OLED display, where black pixels are completely off and don’t emit light. In combination with a specially designed dark interface and automatic brightness adjustments, Circa emits less light at night then your average red-digit alarm clock.
Sleep experts advise to hide the time at night. If you’re a sensitive sleeper, seeing the time at night can start a whirl of calculations that won’t help in falling asleep again. Set Circa to “Dark at Night” and it will only show you the time when you tap the device!
No wireless connectivity at night
Going dark also means automatically shutting off Bluetooth and WiFi at night, when you don’t need it. Then, a few minutes before waking you up, it will switch them back on.

Circa is designed by Dutch industrial designer Robert Bronwasser.
 

 
Circa’s design is unique yet modest and fits within a variety of interiors. We offer several color combinations and a wide variety of clock faces to adapt Circa to fit your taste.
We selected the highest quality materials and components to create a product that will be a joy to use for years to come. Circa’s friendly appearance is defined by the use of fabric on the front and back, we’re working together with leading Danish textile design company Kvadrat to give the product a unique and beautiful finish.
Circa is available in 3 beautiful colors, Day, Night and Dawn.
 

  

 

 

 

Founder Hans Brouwer — a product developer with over 25 years of experience — conceived the idea of creating a 'new' alarm clock years ago. While working on other projects it kept popping up in his mind. Together with Grinn, a partnering technology development company in Wroclaw, Poland he created the first functional prototype back in 2014. 
At the end 2016 he got in contact with Robert Bronwasser and Yannick Brouwer to develop form and functionality in what would eventually become Circa. In April '17, Daan Weijers joined the team, and the team continued developing what Circa is today; a beautiful alarm clock that helps you to sleep better!

Timeline
In the development and testing of our final electronics we faced some issues that resulted in delays in the manufacturing process. We therefore updated our planning accordingly as can be seen below. We do a monthly update here on Indiegogo to keep everybody up to date about where we are in the process. You can find these here.

<p>BIll Kennedy is a fixture in the downtown theater scene. Bill is a wonderful guy who always has a great attitude and is a master of technical theater. Recently, he was working a load-in for me on the Lower East Side and when we finished the call, we saw that his heavy duty bike lock had been cut and his bike had been stolen. Bill lives in Red Hook, an area typically only accessible by a very long walk or a bus ride. A bike is a necessity in this area. A bicycle in Red Hook can easily cut down an hour public transit commute and turn it into a 20 minute bike ride. Replacing a nice bike the one Bill lost is not a cheap endeavor especially on a theater technicians salary around the holidays. I figured a few small contributions from friends might at least get him a little closer to being able to afford a bike and get back to square one.</p>

<p><em>    Four years ago in a coffee shop in Flagstaff, Arizona a serendipitous conversation with a public health nurse sent me on a circuitous journey to become a Family Nurse Practitioner. The odds against me, I worked hard and unexpectedly was accepted to all of the programs I applied to--including the best and most selective in my field! Sadly, the struggle had just begun. Nursing school is expensive, and as a low-income student, federal aid, scholarships and grants don't cover it...</em></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The journey that brought me here began in the most unexpected way: a few months prior to graduation, I dropped out of high school. During the ensuing years, I began increasingly to seek a path that would bring fulfillment and meaning to my life. </p>
<p>Then, a friend invited me to join him on a 2,500 mile cross-country bicycle ride. With my possessions reduced to two panniers, I spent a summer traveling through the deepest parts of America. From oil fields to rural farmlands to reservations, there  emerged a narrative of struggle, hope and perseverance.</p>
<p>This trip deepened my desire to do some good in the world. The next year, I was selected for an internship with the NPS in Arizona, where I interviewed members of several American Indian nations to develop a program about their affiliation with the site.</p>
<p>I loved the opportunity to hear personal stories, but was frustrated that I had nothing to give in return. During a weekend trip, I was hosted by a public health nurse and former field director of the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health. A few weeks later, I ran into him again at a coffee shop.</p>
<p>During our brief encounter, I expressed this frustration to him. Acknowledging my concern, he urged me to consider nursing as a means of giving back. It'd been the furthest thing from my mind, but once he planted the seed, it was the most obvious thing in the world. I haven't looked back since!</p>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>I hope to work in rural, reservation communities through Indian Health Services. As a Family Nurse Practitioner, I can provide comprehensive healthcare throughout the lifespan in an area with few resources. I hold a B.A. in Health &amp; Society, with a body of research on health literacy and access to care.</p>
<p>Receiving my combined BSN/MSN from an institution with a reputation for innovative curriculum and respected faculty will provide a foundation for leadership in my field. That I have come so far in seeing my goals to fruition has instilled confidence that I have chosen a profession in which I will thrive. </p>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>As a low-income student, I can't afford to meet the financial demands of a three-year nursing program without significant support from loans, scholarships and grants. The program which I have selected will require $50,000 out-of-pocket after federal and institutional aid. In addition to merit-based and need-based awards, I am asking that you consider making a donation--an investment in creating a future leader in the healthcare field. </p>
<p><strong>What You'll Get</strong></p>
<p>As an artist, I am offering an array of perks which include photographs depicting scenes from my travels over the past four years; custom beadwork; or, for a contribution of $1,000, a commissioned painting. For contributions from members of the local community, I am also offering a one-hour massage at the $75 level. </p>
<p>Check out the gallery and my website to see my photography!</p>
<p>All contributors will receive hand-written letters throughout my nursing education updating them on my progress towards becoming a Family Nurse Practitioner. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I recognize that not everyone is able to contribute monetarily. For those who are inspired by my journey and would like to help in a different capacity,please pass on my story to your friends and family members. It is my desire to increase access to quality care for all people. This is an opportunity to invest in the future of public health!</p>

<p>You can find more information about me and my goals, education, and travels on my personal website: <strong><a href=""http://stephanieprevic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://stephanieprevic.com/</a></strong></p>
<p>All funds will be used at the institution where I have been accepted, or, if I am unable to afford the cost of tuition, set aside in a savings account until I can put it towards my nursing education. </p>

<p>""<em>After practicing with Suzanne for awhile, I find myself incorporating breath practice almost unconsciously throughout my day. Riding an elevator, waiting for a traffic light to change, standing in line at the grocery store, whenever I find a moment. Over time, I have found it easier to drop into practice in ways I wouldn't have been aware of or even thought possible a couple of years ago. The benefits of pausing for a moment to breathe brings a sense of presence and calmness so that I am ready for it whatever the day brings</em>.""     Anne</p>

<p>""<em>Practicing these breath practices with Suzanne has helped me be more aware of my breath... it provides an oasis for me. One of my big problems with self practice is that I'm impatient + I rush it.

<p>""<em>(After practicing these breath practices,) I have started breathing at work. To the point, where I walk into a meeting stressed out - my whole team (let's out a big exhale) with me! I will use this CD every night! And I hope everyone else does too! </em>""     Christa</p>
