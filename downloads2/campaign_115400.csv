<p>Help pay for the editing, distribution, and cover art of a completed comedy e-novel featuring a strong, funny Australian Indigenous heroine.</p>
<p>See the book extracts below!</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Hi, my name's Jessica Getty. I'm a New Zealander and work as a Web Analyst in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>When I first came to Australia I was very impressed with the engaging Aboriginal sense of humour which is very cheeky, much like the Maori sense of humour.</p>
<p>I had already written a full length crime novel with a Maori detective as the lead character for which I won a place in a group editing session at the Varuna Writers' Centre in the Blue Mountains. However, I wasn't happy with the novel because it was supposed to be dark but it was turning into a comedy! So I put it in the bottom drawer.</p>
<p>After a few months off I decided to play to my strengths - I wanted to introduce a strong Aboriginal character and write a comedy novel that smacked of the irreverent Bush Mechanics humour seen in the TV series. (Google it if you don't know it). I also wanted to make it a rollicking adventure - a sort of sci-fi Famous Five In Sydney crossed with a Ben Elton type comedy crossed with a Marion Keyes romance!</p>
<p>I wasn't sure how it would go down - a white person writing pretty politically incorrect humour with my Black heroine, Tuesday, perhaps the first Black female heroine in a comedy novel in Australia! However, everyone who reads it says they have laughed out loud and that they love the female lead character.</p>

<h3>What your help will be used for</h3>
<p>The novel is completed. The market is young adults/adults. It's called <em>Tuesday, You're Terrific</em> and it's my second unpublished novel. (The first and third novels are sitting on my desk for future re-writing). Any funds are appreciated and will be spent as follows:</p>
<p>1. Fact checking by an experienced Aboriginal author and editor through the Sydney Writers' Centre.</p>
<p>2. One professional illustration through 99 designs for use on the cover or inside the book from a professional illustrator or graphic designer.</p>
<p>3. Lastly, if any money is left over it will go towards a Mac Mini so I can access iAuthor to produce the ebook. This will allow me to easily produce the novel and distribute it for iPad. It will also allow me to more easily decide whether I can/should include graphics and illustrations like the old Famous Five books used to have.</p>

<h3>Book Excerpts</h3>
<div><strong>Chapter Eight Excerpt</strong></div>
<div>
<p><em>“Help! Help! Get us out of here!”</em></p>
<p><em>Mr Scottie MacLaren, whose fork had been halfway to his mouth with tendrils of haggis dangling from his prongs when Bill and Audrey had crashed into his family’s dining room, hesitated. He was in the middle of an important speech to little Errol about the sanctity of the five o’clock family dinner time. “…and one does <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">not</span>  get up from the table <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">just</span> because a car has crashed through the window and come to a stop under our dinner table!” He waggled his juice streaked thumb at little Errol and bunched his great shaggy eyebrows together. “I don’t care if it <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">has</span> rolled to a stop over your foot. Understand?”</em></p>
<p><em>Errol’s little white face nodded solemnly. The glass of milk in his clenched fingers sloshed around above the puttering car engine. </em></p>
<p><em>“Please pass the potatoes, dear.” Scottie asked his wife.</em></p>
<p><em>Maggie MacLaren picked her spuds up from the bumper and the windscreen and the bonnet and slid off the one impaled on the Porsche’s antenna and placed them back in the shattered china bowl on the desecrated dining table.</em></p>
<p><em>“How was your day love?” She asked her husband, picking up a brussel sprout from the side view mirror next to Audrey’s lolling head.</em></p>
<p><em>“Aye, it was rotten. Debt collection in the middle of a State Emergency’s a real bugger.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Daddy,” interrupted his son.</em></p>
<p><em>“Errol,” Scottie MacLaren said calmly, “what have I told you about speaking out of turn?”</em></p>
<p><em>“That it’s ill bred. That it’s the sign of common muck. That it’s the kind of behaviour we could expect from pond scum like Englishmen.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Very good.”</em></p>
<p><em>“But Daddy…”</em></p>
<p><em>His mother sucked in her breath and Scottie MacLaren’s eyebrows knotted together until they were actually knotted (it was one of his wife’s duties to pick them apart at the end of the night). His chin trembled. “What?” He shouted. “What is soooooooo important, you have to interrupt your dear auld Dadde?” He struck a match and lit his pipe, waving the match in the air in front of him.</em></p>
<p><em>“I can hear somebody screaming from the boot.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Is anybody there?” Shouted Tom. “I’m about to…suffocate!”</em></p>
<p><em>This is where Scottie MacLaren hesitated. “Goddammit, we’re no gunna git annae rest!” He thumped his fist on the table which was sitting on the roof of the car.  He leant down and pulled Audrey out of the broken passenger window, dragging her body over the shattered windscreen glass.</em></p>
<p><em>“Watch where yer bleed!” He yelled to Audrey’s comatose head, dropping her on the green patterned carpet. “Come on, woman, give me a hand wi’ the other.”</em></p>
<p><em>Maggie and Scottie had to break open the driver’s door with Maggie’s homemade bread before they could drag Bill out of the squashed little cockpit. Bill was moaning and a trickle of dark red blood ran down his forehead.</em></p>
<p><em>Scottie turned off the engine and all was quiet.</em></p>
<p><em>From the boot came a rat-a-tat-tat.</em></p>
<p><em>“Er, hello?” Tuesday asked.</em></p>
<p><em>Scottie puffed furiously on his pipe and jerked open the boot with Bill’s key. Tom and Tuesday sprang up like Jack-in-the-boxes and swayed back and forth. “Git owt o the car yer bloody houns!” Bellowed Scottie MacLaren. He shook his head at the wet patches of saliva on their crotches. “In front of the wee boy ‘n all.”</em></p>
<p><em>Tom and Tuesday staggered away from the Porsche, their arms supporting each other, Tom’s erection softening faster than Errol’s foot beneath the Porsche’s eight kilogram tyre. They collapsed beside Audrey and Bill with relief. Tuesday knelt over the unconscious Audrey and slapped her gently across the cheeks and Tom took the opportunity to gently king hit a conscious Bill which rendered him unconscious, a state which Tom was sure would benefit from some more king hitting but which Tuesday gently restrained him from doing.</em></p>
<p><em>Scottie and his wife lifted up the Porsche from Errol’s foot. “Ooch, ‘tis only a scratch.” Scottie boomed, tapping his pipe ash into the exposed raw tendons of his son’s foot as he examined it.  “Back to the table ‘n don’t think wi’ oul this excitement ah have naye noticed ya have naye eaten ya sprouts.”</em></p>
<p><em>Maggie MacLaren smoothed down her skirt, brushed the dust and debris from the collapsed wall off her chair, and removed Clara’s glass nipple from her bread roll.</em></p>
<p><em>Errol MacLaren stared despondently at his dinner plate, thinking how unfair it was that despite the bits of smoking metal and ceiling and chandelier and brake lights and pink batt stuffing and blood and skin covering the dining room table, there were still three boiled brussel sprouts sitting perfectly neatly on his plate in front of him.</em></p>
<p><em>Scottie MacLaren smoked his pipe contently and revelled in the quiet joy of dinner with his family, rejoicing in the peaceful bird song that floated on the summer breeze through the four metre hole in his house.</em></p>
<p><em>And Tuesday and Tom and Audrey and Bill bled quietly in the corner.</em></p>

<p><strong>Chapter Seven Excerpt</strong></p>
<p><em>“Ssssssssssssssh,” Anthea ordered. Her voice came from directly beneath the bug in the light bulb. Her footsteps walked slowly about the secret room. She sniffed.</em></p>
<p><em>            “What ith it, Anthea?” Asked a heavy voice with a lisp.</em></p>
<p><em>            “I swear I can smell - porridge. And…,” she hesitated. “The smell of two people in love!”</em></p>
<p><em>            There was a mumble of horrified voices.</em></p>
<p><em>            “Who in this room is in love?” Screeched Anthea.</em></p>
<p><em>            A number of men spoke at once. “I’m not! No, not me! Never! Wouldn’t think of it. In love? Wouldn’t dare! No, never!”</em></p>
<p><em>            A brave voice piped up proudly from the back of the room. “I am.” He stepped forward closer to Anthea. “I am in love with Abdul!”</em></p>
<p><em>            There was a collective gasp.</em></p>
<p><em>            “It’s true.” Abdul admitted in a deep voice. “Kevin and I are in love.”</em></p>
<p><em>            “In <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">love</span>?” Hissed Anthea. “And how exactly does this fit in with your roles as suicide bombers? People who are in love want to live not <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">die</span>.”</em></p>
<p><em>            “Hmmm.” Kevin shuffled his shoe along the floor. “I suppose it is a bit of a contradiction.”</em></p>
<p><em>            “I hadn’t thought of that,” said Abdul brightly.</em></p>
<p><em>            “There’s only one thing for it,” Anthea stated matter of factly. There was the sound of a gun cocking. “Let go of each other’s hand and face the wall.”</em></p>
<p><em>            “Hang about,” said Kevin, “isn’t there some way we can still be in love and help out with your terribly secret evil plan?”</em></p>
<p><em>            “I know,” suggested Abdul helpfully, “we could just plant the bombs and tip-toe away.”</em></p>
<p><em>            There was a general murmur of agreement.</em></p>
<p><em>            “YOU CAN’T JUST TIP TOE AWAY!” Screamed Anthea. “YOU ALL NEED TO DIE!”</em></p>
<p><em>            “Can’t we just get away with a limp?” Someone asked from the sidelines. “I’ve always wanted a limp. Distinguished looking.”</em></p>
<p><em>            “Or a broken nothe?” Lisped the man beside her. “I wouldn’t mind a broken nothe. I’ve needed to get it fixthed for ageth.”</em></p>
<p><em>            There was a clamour of excited voices. “Singed eyelashes! A missing pinkie! A little scar on the cheek! Girls go mad for facial scars!”</em></p>
<p><em>            “SHUT UP!” Anthea roared. “You <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">have</span> to die so that you never, ever tell anyone about it!”</em></p>
<p><em>            “Ooh, I promise!” Squealed Kevin.</em></p>
<p><em>            “So do I,” said Abdul, “I promise ever so much. Really.”</em></p>
<p><em>            The room rang with agreement. “So do I! So do I! I’ll never tell, ever! Your secret’s safe with me! Not a word! What evil bomb plot? Do you know an evil bomb plot to destroy the most expensive over-priced city in the world? No! No!” There were shouts all around. “No! Never heard of it! I have no idea why there are eight tons of fertilizer and three boxes of dynamite and lots of little red and blue wires and a great big secret map with all the bomb sites drawn on it in this secret room!”</em></p>
<p><em> “Neither do I! Neither do !” Shouted everyone.</em></p>
<p><em>Anthea sighed. “That’s very kind of you. But I <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">am</span> sorry, you <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">are</span> going to have to die.”</em></p>
<p><em>The were murmurs of disappointment.</em></p>
<p><em>“Now, Kevin and Abdul, turn around you two. I can’t have two people who desperately want to move to Rushcutters Bay and own two cats and wear black turtle necks on my evil team.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Wait a minute,” piped up a voice. “I’m in love too.”</em></p>
<p><em>There was a shocked silence.</em></p>
<p><em>“I’m in love with…Brian.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Wot?” Said Brian.</em></p>
<p><em>“You know,” hissed the voice, “we’re in lurrrve. Like, it’s a bummer, I know. But there you go, sorry about that. Cause you know, like, wouldn’t it be funny if we were <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">all</span> in love, cause then like, poor Anthea here wouldn’t be able to kill us because then like, they’d be no one to carry out her evil plan. You know, wow, I mean, like, wouldn’t that be a bummer.”</em></p>
<p><em>There was a bit of a confused silence.</em></p>
<p><em>“I love you,” said Brian.</em></p>
<p><em>“I love Mohammed!” Thundered a deep-chested man.</em></p>
<p><em>“I love Peter!” Squealed another.</em></p>
<p><em>“So do I. So do I. I love Peter too!”</em></p>
<p><em>“SHUT UP!” Spat Anthea. “WHERE HAVE ALL THE EVIL MEN GONE? You couldn’t move for evil men a few years ago! <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Now</span>, what can you find? A few disgruntled postal workers at best! A determined writer of letters to the Editor! Well, I GIVE UP, GODAMMIT! NO ONE IS GOING TO DIE!”</em></p>
<p><em>A cheer rose from the room.</em></p>
<p><em>Across the road from Tom’s house, Mr G lumbered up Anthea’s front steps, the sweat streaming from his face, his armpits wet.</em></p>
<p><em>“SOMEONE IS GOING TO DIE!” He thundered.</em></p>
<p><em>“Uh oh.” Said Tuesday, Tom, and Esther.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<h3><strong>Chapter Eight</strong></h3>

<p>“I’m her lover,” Bill gloated. “Me and Tuesday.” (Audrey wasn’t around to correct his grammar anymore).</p>
<p>“Yeah, right.” Tom snorted. “You wish. Look how beautiful she is. As if she’d be interested in you.”</p>
<p>Bill turned back to Tuesday. “Beautiful?” He’d never thought of Tuesday in that light. Cute sure. Attractive of course, even in her stained Goodies t-shirt with her breasts doubling the size of the ‘o’ and the ‘d’. But beautiful? Did Tom know something he didn’t? “Whatever. The point is…” Bill screwed up his forehead. He hated that, when you’d just got your finger on the point and then it slipped away from you and you were left holding your hand in the air, pointing.</p>
<p>“The point is…we’re lovers…of sorts.”</p>
<p>Tom laughed and looked back at Tuesday. “Tuesday! Aren’t you going to defend yourself!”</p>
<p>Tuesday nodded vigorously at him. “No.” She stood and inched her way along the couch towards the door. “I mean - this is not the time for reminiscing, musing, self-berating, pondering, reflecting, deliberating, concluding, and philosophising, Tom. I have a fire to fight.” She tried to sneak past them both.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute,” Tom pulled her back by her collar. “You’re just neighbours, right? This old man and you?”</p>
<p>“I’m not old!” Bellowed Bill. “I’m charismatic! I’m mature! I’m sophisticated. I’m…” Bill tried to find the right word. “Thirty-nine!”</p>
<p>Tuesday and Tom didn’t even bother to challenge such an obvious lie. Bill was as much thirty-nine as Tuesday was a white male accountant from Turramurra.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I can prove it,” Bill gloated, giving Tuesday a triumphant look.</p>
<p>“That you’re thirty-nine?” Tom and Tuesday gasped.</p>
<p>“No!” Bill pulled up the waistband of his slipping pants so that they once again covered the crack of his backside. “I can prove that Tuesday and I enjoy a certain intimacy. That our love-making has been passionate and sex-u-al.”</p>
<p>“Bill,” Tuesday hastened. “I know you’re upset that your wife has left you and become a friend of mine and I know the cocaine you take has addled your brain until it’s just pea soup with real peas because you snorted fifteen peas up your nose to show me how the body’s digestion and respiratory systems are inter-related except that they’re not and now you have fifteen peas lodged in your left temporal lobe, <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">I know </span></em>these things have altered your sense of reality, so why don’t we just forget about this?”</p>
<p>“How can you prove it?” Tom asked Bill, folding his arms.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a CAT scan somewhere,” Bill said.</p>
<p>“No, I mean, how can you prove you’ve slept with her?”</p>
<p>“Tom!” Tuesday put on her most indignant face. “I refuse to let you talk about me like this when I’m still in the room!” She crept towards the door. “Do it after I leave.”</p>
<p>“She has a tiny white scar in the shape of a gun on her ass.”</p>
<p>Tuesday hesitated and paled. If only she hadn’t been playing Cluedo that day with her four year old brother. If only her mother hadn’t boiled the game pieces after her brother baked them in his ‘mud’ cakes. If only her mother hadn’t left the tiny white hot murder weapons to cool on the kitchen counter next to the footstool.</p>
<p>Still, Tuesday <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">had</span></em> set a trend. All of her brothers had little white scars on their black bottoms and Tuesday couldn’t count the number of family photos taken of them mooning the camera and grinning over their shoulders. </p>
<p>“First of all,” Tuesday growled, “I have a bottom. I do <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">not</span></em> have an ass.”</p>
<p>“Secondly, I may or may not have a scar in the shape of a gun in the bottom quadrant of my left buttock. I don’t often look at my bottom so frankly I am unable to confirm or deny Bill’s allegation.”</p>
<p>“Well, I wouldn’t mind looking at your bottom,” said Tom. “You know, just to sort this out once and for all.”</p>
<p>“Neither would I,” added Bill. “I’d quite like to look at your bottom too.”</p>
“NO ONE IS GOING TO LOOK AT MY BOTTOM!” Tuesday gritted through her teeth.<br/><br/>

Background
Hi, my name's Jessica Getty. I'm a New Zealander and work as a Web Analyst in Sydney, Australia.
When I first came to Australia I was very impressed with the engaging Aboriginal sense of humour which is very cheeky, much like the Maori sense of humour.
I had already written a full length crime novel with a Maori detective as the lead character for which I won a place in a group editing session at the Varuna Writers' Centre in the Blue Mountains. However, I wasn't happy with the novel because it was supposed to be dark but it was turning into a comedy! So I put it in the bottom drawer.
After a few months off I decided to play to my strengths - I wanted to introduce a strong Aboriginal character and write a comedy novel that smacked of the irreverent Bush Mechanics humour seen in the TV series. (Google it if you don't know it). I also wanted to make it a rollicking adventure - a sort of sci-fi Famous Five In Sydney crossed with a Ben Elton type comedy crossed with a Marion Keyes romance!
I wasn't sure how it would go down - a white person writing pretty politically incorrect humour with my Black heroine, Tuesday, perhaps the first Black female heroine in a comedy novel in Australia! However, everyone who reads it says they have laughed out loud and that they love the female lead character.


What your help will be used for
The novel is completed. The market is young adults/adults. It's called Tuesday, You're Terrific and it's my second unpublished novel. (The first and third novels are sitting on my desk for future re-writing). Any funds are appreciated and will be spent as follows:

Book Excerpts
Chapter Eight Excerpt

“Help! Help! Get us out of here!”
Mr Scottie MacLaren, whose fork had been halfway to his mouth with tendrils of haggis dangling from his prongs when Bill and Audrey had crashed into his family’s dining room, hesitated. He was in the middle of an important speech to little Errol about the sanctity of the five o’clock family dinner time. “…and one does not  get up from the table just because a car has crashed through the window and come to a stop under our dinner table!” He waggled his juice streaked thumb at little Errol and bunched his great shaggy eyebrows together. “I don’t care if it has rolled to a stop over your foot. Understand?”
Errol’s little white face nodded solemnly. The glass of milk in his clenched fingers sloshed around above the puttering car engine. 
“Please pass the potatoes, dear.” Scottie asked his wife.
Maggie MacLaren picked her spuds up from the bumper and the windscreen and the bonnet and slid off the one impaled on the Porsche’s antenna and placed them back in the shattered china bowl on the desecrated dining table.
“How was your day love?” She asked her husband, picking up a brussel sprout from the side view mirror next to Audrey’s lolling head.
“Aye, it was rotten. Debt collection in the middle of a State Emergency’s a real bugger.”
“Daddy,” interrupted his son.
“Errol,” Scottie MacLaren said calmly, “what have I told you about speaking out of turn?”

“Watch where yer bleed!” He yelled to Audrey’s comatose head, dropping her on the green patterned carpet. “Come on, woman, give me a hand wi’ the other.”
Maggie and Scottie had to break open the driver’s door with Maggie’s homemade bread before they could drag Bill out of the squashed little cockpit. Bill was moaning and a trickle of dark red blood ran down his forehead.

            There was a collective gasp.
            “It’s true.” Abdul admitted in a deep voice. “Kevin and I are in love.”
            “In love?” Hissed Anthea. “And how exactly does this fit in with your roles as suicide bombers? People who are in love want to live not die.”
            “Hmmm.” Kevin shuffled his shoe along the floor. “I suppose it is a bit of a contradiction.”
            “I hadn’t thought of that,” said Abdul brightly.
            “There’s only one thing for it,” Anthea stated matter of factly. There was the sound of a gun cocking. “Let go of each other’s hand and face the wall.”
            “Hang about,” said Kevin, “isn’t there some way we can still be in love and help out with your terribly secret evil plan?”
            “I know,” suggested Abdul helpfully, “we could just plant the bombs and tip-toe away.”
            There was a general murmur of agreement.
            “YOU CAN’T JUST TIP TOE AWAY!” Screamed Anthea. “YOU ALL NEED TO DIE!”
            “Can’t we just get away with a limp?” Someone asked from the sidelines. “I’ve always wanted a limp. Distinguished looking.”
            “Or a broken nothe?” Lisped the man beside her. “I wouldn’t mind a broken nothe. I’ve needed to get it fixthed for ageth.”
            There was a clamour of excited voices. “Singed eyelashes! A missing pinkie! A little scar on the cheek! Girls go mad for facial scars!”
            “SHUT UP!” Anthea roared. “You have to die so that you never, ever tell anyone about it!”
            “Ooh, I promise!” Squealed Kevin.
            “So do I,” said Abdul, “I promise ever so much. Really.”
            The room rang with agreement. “So do I! So do I! I’ll never tell, ever! Your secret’s safe with me! Not a word! What evil bomb plot? Do you know an evil bomb plot to destroy the most expensive over-priced city in the world? No! No!” There were shouts all around. “No! Never heard of it! I have no idea why there are eight tons of fertilizer and three boxes of dynamite and lots of little red and blue wires and a great big secret map with all the bomb sites drawn on it in this secret room!”
 “Neither do I! Neither do !” Shouted everyone.
Anthea sighed. “That’s very kind of you. But I am sorry, you are going to have to die.”
The were murmurs of disappointment.
“Now, Kevin and Abdul, turn around you two. I can’t have two people who desperately want to move to Rushcutters Bay and own two cats and wear black turtle necks on my evil team.”
“Wait a minute,” piped up a voice. “I’m in love too.”
There was a shocked silence.
“I’m in love with…Brian.”
“Wot?” Said Brian.
“You know,” hissed the voice, “we’re in lurrrve. Like, it’s a bummer, I know. But there you go, sorry about that. Cause you know, like, wouldn’t it be funny if we were all in love, cause then like, poor Anthea here wouldn’t be able to kill us because then like, they’d be no one to carry out her evil plan. You know, wow, I mean, like, wouldn’t that be a bummer.”
There was a bit of a confused silence.
“I love you,” said Brian.
“I love Mohammed!” Thundered a deep-chested man.
“I love Peter!” Squealed another.
“So do I. So do I. I love Peter too!”
“SHUT UP!” Spat Anthea. “WHERE HAVE ALL THE EVIL MEN GONE? You couldn’t move for evil men a few years ago! Now, what can you find? A few disgruntled postal workers at best! A determined writer of letters to the Editor! Well, I GIVE UP, GODAMMIT! NO ONE IS GOING TO DIE!”
A cheer rose from the room.
Across the road from Tom’s house, Mr G lumbered up Anthea’s front steps, the sweat streaming from his face, his armpits wet.
“SOMEONE IS GOING TO DIE!” He thundered.
“Uh oh.” Said Tuesday, Tom, and Esther.
 
Chapter Eight


“I’m her lover,” Bill gloated. “Me and Tuesday.” (Audrey wasn’t around to correct his grammar anymore).
“Yeah, right.” Tom snorted. “You wish. Look how beautiful she is. As if she’d be interested in you.”
Bill turned back to Tuesday. “Beautiful?” He’d never thought of Tuesday in that light. Cute sure. Attractive of course, even in her stained Goodies t-shirt with her breasts doubling the size of the ‘o’ and the ‘d’. But beautiful? Did Tom know something he didn’t? “Whatever. The point is…” Bill screwed up his forehead. He hated that, when you’d just got your finger on the point and then it slipped away from you and you were left holding your hand in the air, pointing.
“The point is…we’re lovers…of sorts.”
Tom laughed and looked back at Tuesday. “Tuesday! Aren’t you going to defend yourself!”
Tuesday nodded vigorously at him. “No.” She stood and inched her way along the couch towards the door. “I mean - this is not the time for reminiscing, musing, self-berating, pondering, reflecting, deliberating, concluding, and philosophising, Tom. I have a fire to fight.” She tried to sneak past them both.
“Wait a minute,” Tom pulled her back by her collar. “You’re just neighbours, right? This old man and you?”
“I’m not old!” Bellowed Bill. “I’m charismatic! I’m mature! I’m sophisticated. I’m…” Bill tried to find the right word. “Thirty-nine!”
Tuesday and Tom didn’t even bother to challenge such an obvious lie. Bill was as much thirty-nine as Tuesday was a white male accountant from Turramurra.
“Anyway, I can prove it,” Bill gloated, giving Tuesday a triumphant look.
“That you’re thirty-nine?” Tom and Tuesday gasped.
“No!” Bill pulled up the waistband of his slipping pants so that they once again covered the crack of his backside. “I can prove that Tuesday and I enjoy a certain intimacy. That our love-making has been passionate and sex-u-al.”
“Bill,” Tuesday hastened. “I know you’re upset that your wife has left you and become a friend of mine and I know the cocaine you take has addled your brain until it’s just pea soup with real peas because you snorted fifteen peas up your nose to show me how the body’s digestion and respiratory systems are inter-related except that they’re not and now you have fifteen peas lodged in your left temporal lobe, I know these things have altered your sense of reality, so why don’t we just forget about this?”
“How can you prove it?” Tom asked Bill, folding his arms.
“I’ve got a CAT scan somewhere,” Bill said.
“No, I mean, how can you prove you’ve slept with her?”
“Tom!” Tuesday put on her most indignant face. “I refuse to let you talk about me like this when I’m still in the room!” She crept towards the door. “Do it after I leave.”
“She has a tiny white scar in the shape of a gun on her ass.”
Tuesday hesitated and paled. If only she hadn’t been playing Cluedo that day with her four year old brother. If only her mother hadn’t boiled the game pieces after her brother baked them in his ‘mud’ cakes. If only her mother hadn’t left the tiny white hot murder weapons to cool on the kitchen counter next to the footstool.
Still, Tuesday had set a trend. All of her brothers had little white scars on their black bottoms and Tuesday couldn’t count the number of family photos taken of them mooning the camera and grinning over their shoulders. 
“First of all,” Tuesday growled, “I have a bottom. I do not have an ass.”
“Secondly, I may or may not have a scar in the shape of a gun in the bottom quadrant of my left buttock. I don’t often look at my bottom so frankly I am unable to confirm or deny Bill’s allegation.”
“Well, I wouldn’t mind looking at your bottom,” said Tom. “You know, just to sort this out once and for all.”
“Neither would I,” added Bill. “I’d quite like to look at your bottom too.”
“NO ONE IS GOING TO LOOK AT MY BOTTOM!” Tuesday gritted through her teeth.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Could You Use More Money In These Tough Times?<br/></strong></h2>
<h3><strong>The Need</strong></h3>
<p>If you could spend just $20 and know you would be able to pocket an additional $1,000 or more in savings, would you consider that a good purchase?What could you do with an extra $1,000, $3,000 or even $10,000 this next year? Would it change your circumstances in any way? Think how much even $1,000 in extra money next year would help you out. An extra $1,000 would pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 250 gallons of gas, or</li>
<li>Food for a family of four for 2-3 months, or</li>
<li>3-4 months of heating or cooling bills, or</li>
<li>Car payments for 3-4 months, or</li>
<li>The first $1,000 of an emergency fund, or</li>
<li>A long overdue family vacation</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, even $1,000 can make a big difference. Imagine what $2,000, $5,000, $7,000 or even $10,000 could do for you? The prolonged tough economy has left over 70% of us struggling just to make ends meet from month to month. With prices rising faster than our paychecks - if you even <em>have</em> a job - it's getting harder each month to survive financially.</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>We've written a book called <em>MORE MONEY in Tough Times: Discover the $10,000 You Never Knew You Had</em> that can lead people who are struggling (maybe even you?) out of their personal ""economic slump"" and help them find the hidden money they've had all along.</p>
<div>This book is a collection of over 100 ways to keep more of the money you're already earning simply by spending smarter. It also includes some basic financial advice on how to better manage your financial life for maximum benefit both now and for the future.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>MORE MONEY will show you:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>How to get sale prices on groceries when everyone else is paying full price (without using coupons!)</li>
<li>How to save hundreds on your car insurance by <em>increasing</em> your coverage and keeping the same insurance company</li>
<li>How to save money on gas before you ever leave your driveway</li>
<li>How carrying balances on your credit cards can <em>make you money</em> if you can take advantage of this secret technique</li>
<li>How to save thousands on medical tests and procedures even when you don't have health insurance</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>We've uncovered over 100 other ways to help you keep more of your own money as well, many of which are unique to this book. Each money saving idea is followed by a Potential Savings section so you can see how much each simple change you make can add to the extra money you'll find.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All of these ideas are simple to implement and can result in significant savings over the course of the year. Some may only save you $30, but some can save you several hundred dollars in a year. Combined they total well over $10,000 in annual savings if you were able to implement them all.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This book doesn't tell you to cut up your credit cards or live in a cardboard box just to save on rent. Instead, MORE MONEY shows you how to spend your money more efficiently so you have thousands left over at the end of the year <em>without reducing your lifestyle!</em>

<h2>Why This Book Is So Important</h2>

<p>This project is unique in another way: you will get back far more than you give. By putting even a few of these ideas into practice in your own life you'll save far more than any reward level you choose and you'll be helping us to spread the word to others as well.</p>

<li>To provide books to reward you, our backers</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""_mce_tagged_br"">Stretch Goal</h3>

Here’s the deal: I need $5000.
This money will cover the costs to
self-publish my manuscript, “Sins of the Father,” including editorial services,
cover design, e-book formatting and distribution, worldwide distribution,
promotional materials, book launch/signing materials and SO much more.

Every dollar
will go toward all aspects of the self-publishing process and distribution (whether I meet my goal or not). If
I exceed my goal, the excess will go toward the self-publishing of my next book
(already titled and outlined). In the event a major publisher offers me a deal, the excess money will be donated to International Crisis
Aid, an organization that has joined the fight against child sex
trafficking. 

All contributors will receive a
personal thank you note from me (you must provide a valid mailing address). You can donate any amount!
Contributions of certain amounts will
receive a free e-book or physical copy of the book (must provide a valid
mailing address and add $10 for shipping and handling)!
Folks that are feeling
extraordinarily generous may receive a story, written by me, starring them as
the protagonist or a private reading for an intimate gathering of friends,
complete with refreshments.
Of course, there are those that may
just want to donate for the sake of donating. That’s fine, too. You don’t have
to receive a perk to donate but, at least let me send you a thank you card!
THE IMPACT
By contributing, you
are not only helping me to achieve a lifelong dream, you are impacting my
future and enriching my life, as well. Once this book is finally in print and
available for purchase, I believe a flood gate of book ideas will open for me.
The fear that I’ll never see my dreams realized will diminish and I will be
free to continue to pursue my passion.
Who doesn't want to
have a hand in helping someone realize something so important to them? I know I
love to see people have their dreams come true and I am always happy to be
among those who helped it happen.
OTHER WAYS TO HELP
I realize that not
everyone will be able to contribute. You can help in other ways, too!

<p>Author's
Note</p>
<p>It
is surprising how 'little'
instances
happen to influence one's life.
They appear to be coincidences but I believe they are not.
They are serendipitous circumstances that  have meaning if we allow
ourselves to believe:
much like the young child in all of us.</p>
<p>The
story is based on real  instances but, of course, the retelling has
taken some of its own course.
For many years, I had harbored the thought of telling this story but
it was an enigma of what form it should take.</p>
<p>As
it happened, it was a chance meeting with an author of books for
children and the subsequent meeting of a young boy with the name RJ
(Ramon
Jacob)
that was the impetus to put pen to paper.

</p>
<p>It
was the spark that lit the fire, and, if I may add, the Bug that bit.</p>
</li>
<li>*** As a contributor your your participation will be important in bringing this project to life and raising it to a level that I could not achieve alone! ***</li>
</ul><p></p><p>What
is the Story about?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ramon
Jacob
learns to cope with the loss of his mother and adopts the Ladybug
as his symbol of her spirit.
 
</p>
<p>She
becomes a beacon in his emotional struggles and he believes that she
is always there to look over him, to calm him in his anxious moments,
to help him accept life's servings of fate, and, above all, to learn
to be positive and forward moving in life.</p>
<p>This
is a story for young people ages 8-12
and as well for 'children
at heart'
past the age of 20.
For those age 13-19,
you are invited to make the choice – you just might like this book.</p><p>Other images:  <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.182232071983370.1073741832.156748067865104&amp;type=1&amp;l=682d1c4f3f"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">....for More images of the publication...</a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; </h3><h3>What <b style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;""><i>You </i></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Get</span>

<p>Unique format 4.25 x 11.00 inches</p>
<p>- using aspects of ancient Chinese
bookbinding techniques:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
By serendipitous circumstance, I
discovered a technique of bookbinding that was prevalent during the
Ming dynasty (1366 – 1644)  right up to the early 1900's when China
produced documents by printing on one side of a large sized paper
which was then folded in half.  The folded sheets was held between
two boards and then tied with cord (often red or yellow) through
holes on the raw side of the pages and finally knotted to become the
finished binding. Also, traditional Chinese books read from right to
left, hence the similar front and back covers. To impart an artisan
approach, I have incorporated many of the techniques in the creation
of this book.</p>

is surprising how 'little'
instances
happen to influence one's life.
They appear to be coincidences but I believe they are not.
They are serendipitous circumstances that  have meaning if we allow
ourselves to believe:
much like the young child in all of us.
The
story is based on real  instances but, of course, the retelling has
taken some of its own course.
For many years, I had harbored the thought of telling this story but
it was an enigma of what form it should take.
As
it happened, it was a chance meeting with an author of books for
children and the subsequent meeting of a young boy with the name RJ
(Ramon
Jacob)
that was the impetus to put pen to paper.


It
was the spark that lit the fire, and, if I may add, the Bug that bit.

*** As a contributor your your participation will be important in bringing this project to life and raising it to a level that I could not achieve alone! ***
What
is the Story about?

Ramon
Jacob
learns to cope with the loss of his mother and adopts the Ladybug
as his symbol of her spirit.
 

She
becomes a beacon in his emotional struggles and he believes that she
is always there to look over him, to calm him in his anxious moments,
to help him accept life's servings of fate, and, above all, to learn
to be positive and forward moving in life.
This
is a story for young people ages 8-12
and as well for 'children
at heart'
past the age of 20.
For those age 13-19,
you are invited to make the choice – you just might like this book.Other images:  ....for More images of the publication...What We Need & What You Get

- using aspects of ancient Chinese
bookbinding techniques:


By serendipitous circumstance, I
discovered a technique of bookbinding that was prevalent during the
Ming dynasty (1366 – 1644)  right up to the early 1900's when China
produced documents by printing on one side of a large sized paper
which was then folded in half.  The folded sheets was held between
two boards and then tied with cord (often red or yellow) through
holes on the raw side of the pages and finally knotted to become the
finished binding. Also, traditional Chinese books read from right to
left, hence the similar front and back covers. To impart an artisan
approach, I have incorporated many of the techniques in the creation
of this book.

<p> As for the campaign itself – as you’ve

I’m from Bulgaria and the novel is written in Bulgarian. However, since
Bulgaria is a pretty small country and living off of writing alone is quite
hard here, I decided to try and get the book translated into English and

professional translator Alexander Gurovski and is half-way completed. After
that, of course, it will go through professional editing and then – to you!</p>
<p>And all that is the reason why I
started this crowdfunding campaign – to find in you some of my future readers
and to try and gather the rest of the funds I need. All in all, the costs for
the translation, editing, website, cover etc are around $3500 but since a part
of that is already taken care of, I decided to put the campaign’s goal at $2500.
Even with a bit less I’ll be able to finish everything eventually, but I’d
still be extremely happy to reach my goal. Every extra dollar after the goal is
reached will go into the translation of my short-stories which are part of the
novel’s world (and free on my website), into additional illustrations for the
book and more.</p><p><b>CAMPAIGN PERKS:</b></p><p>In thanks for your gift to support my enterprise, you can receive:</p><p></p><p>$4

<p><b>So why a trequel?</b></p>
<p>HELLO EVERYBARDY! - this is Daryl Qilin Yam, Joshua Ip, and Ruth Tang.</p>
<p>We are the editors of <i>SingPoWriMo 2016: The Anthology</i>, survivors from the team that oversaw this month-long, write-a-poem-a-day challenge. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">SingPoWriMo is really more than just a thing you do on Facebook for the heck of it – it's an annual gathering of like-minded people; a rigorous exercise both demanding and rewarding; as well as a bold, balls-out foray into the literary scene.</span></p>
<p>Our dear Facebook group has grown to over 2,400 members in our third year, sustaining our record of nonstop 100% growth year-on-year! We don't know if we can keep this up, but the poetry is definitely coming. Thousands of poems were generated this month by poets both seasoned and fresh onto the party boat. Asingbols? Check. Udaiyaathathu? Check. Poems on the MRT? Ch-ch-check. Singapore literature is the beast that just refuses to die, and this year's edition of the anthology seeks to collect the best of these poems in a sizeable volume, published and released by Math Paper Press by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Poetry. Is. Coming!!!!</p>
<p><b>How does the money work?</b></p>
<p>The quality has gone up year after year, and this time we had to pull together a team of junior moderators just to make sure everything got read and properly sifted through. They've compiled a longlist in the hundreds, and we'll need to work through that before we can have a good sense of what this year's collection will look like, but nevertheless, we hope to keep the final manuscript to under 200 pages. So the approximate cost of producing an anthology will be (all costs in SGD):</p>
<p>1. ~$4000 in printing costs<br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">2. ~$2000 in design/layout costs<br/></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">3. Marketing/Distribution costs<br/></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">4. Editorial Costs - zero, we're volunteering.<br/>5. Royalties - &lt;$2000 (~$20 per book x &lt;100 contributors??) we're giving out contributors' copies, not cash at this stage. Contributors retain all their rights.</span></p>
<p>Math Paper Press will be covering items 2 and 3, but in the community-driven spirit of SingPoWriMo, we're going back to Indiegogo to raise funds for this anthology and ease the financial burden off Math Paper Press / BooksActually, the little independent press / bookstore that could! A cut will also go to Sing Lit Station, our newly-founded literary non-profit that organises SingPoWriMo, puts together the moderating team, and provides all the free food and booze at the parties. Finally, if we do manage to raise more funds than expected, we want to give out copies of the anthology to schools and other places that can afford more exposure to local literature!</p>
<p><b>Why should I care?</b></p>
<p>Because Singapore Lit matters. Because you love all things to do with the making of books, the making of stories, the making of exquisite things with words alone. Because, for some strange reason, you feel inspired to write poetry of your own, but don't know how to go about doing it and making your own voice heard.</p>
<p>Because you just have a lot of spare cash lying around, and you want to throw it to a project whose editors and publishers are starving, like, literally. Because your friend is in the anthology and you know, yeah, you know. Because there are young kids in schools who are made to think that literature is not important, not essential to our daily lives, and simply not fun at all to do or read or study. Because this book is testament that literature is all games and hard work and rainbows and the small miracles that happen when a good poem comes together. And because this book is about a thousand people, telling one another to have another go at this wonderful, frustrating, and yet altogether mind-defying smorgasm of a poetry challenge.</p>
<p>Because SingPoWriMo is not simply about you, or me – it's all about all of us, and that same yet strangely variegated language we all speak in: poetry.</p>

dice Christine Weisser, ex-coordinadora en el proyecto de Colombia de Peace Brigades International,
acompañante psicosocial y profesional en terapia de Gestalt. </p>
<p>(ver abajo para entrevista sobre novela en Contagio
Radio con Alexandra Huck y Christine Weisser y reseñas en revistas alemanes de
la novela).</p>
<h2><b>Como nació la novela?</b></h2><p>
Soy Alexandra Huck y trabajé en Colombia / Urabá con PBI (Brigadas
Internacionales de Paz) en el año 1999/2000 y desde entonces he estado al tanto
de lo que sucede en la región y he realizado varias visitas. En algún momento
pensé que contar las historias de allá en el marco de más informes de derechos
humanos no era suficiente, ni iba a llegar a muchas personas, ya que yo misma
prefiero leer una novela sobre algo que me interesa. A la vez, la lucha de la
gente por su territorio  muchas veces parecía una verdadera novela de
suspense plasmada en la vida real, que solo faltaba poner en papel.</p>
<p>Decidí
emprender esto, regresé a Colombia y me quedé ocho semanas en Cacarica para todavía
conocer más historias, e impregnarme de los sabores, colores y sonidos que me
faltaban. Demoré unos años en escribir y publiqué la novela en Alemania en
noviembre 2014 con sus 472 páginas. Sólo pude escribir esa “obra de ficción
real” en mi propio idioma, el alemán, no obstante, desde el principio me llegó
el reclamo de que la gente en Colombia -y en otras partes- quería leerla
también. ¡Me parece más que justo! Las personas en Alemania y Suiza que han
podido leerla me animaron mucho a traducirla, como un paso más para hacer
memoria. </p>
<h2><b>¿A
qué va el dinero del crowdfunding?</b></h2>
<p>Con
la ayuda de un amigo recomendado por la Comisión Intereclesial de Justicia y
Paz encontré una editorial que quiere publicar la novela, siempre y cuando yo me
haga cargo de obtener una buena traducción. La versión alemana salió en
self-publishing, y sin casa editorial alemana es más difícil conseguir la
traducción. Para una traducción buena y profesional -y otra cosa no tiene
sentido- el costo total llega a 7.000 Euros. La traductora es Colombiana, vive
en Bogotá, conoce el Chocó y la problemática del desplazamiento y sus impactos.
Por iniciativa propia ya conseguí 4.000 Euros de financiación y yo estoy
dispuesta a poner otros 1.500. Por ende, me faltan los 1.500 Euros de esta
campaña de crowdfunding para terminar la traducción. Ya hemos empezado y
queremos tener el libro publicado en febrero de 2017, cuando se conmemoran 20 años
de los hechos reales (la Operación Génesis en el Cacarica), con los cuales se
relaciona esta novela. </p>
<p>Todo
el dinero del Crowdfunding va para el pago de la traducción. Se espera que la
novela salga impresa y a librerías y, obviamente, estoy muy pendiente de
asegurar que a las comunidades que conozco y me inspiraron lleguen también ejemplares. <b><br/></b></p><h4><b>Si no usas paypal o tarjeta crédito y quieres contribuir y tener la recompensa respectiva contactame a post(a)alexandrahuck.de y te mando los datos de banco. <br/></b></h4><b>
</b><p>En
Constanza Viera encontramos a una persona capaz de hacer la traducción. Ella tradujo
un capítulo de prueba, que tuve el honor de leer parcialmente en Cacarica,
Chocó en febrero 2016. <b><br/></b></p><h2><b>¿Cuándo
se publica la traducción? </b></h2>
<p>¡Ya
hemos avanzado y queremos tener el libro listo para publicación en febrero
2017!!! Es ambicioso, porque mientras tanto hay que hacer la traducción,
revisión, corrección de estilo, diseño, diagramación, impresión... </p>
<h3><b>¿Y
qué pasa en caso de que la novela sea un super-éxito y la autora termina
ganando mucho dinero con ella? </b></h3><h2>
</h2><p>Pues,
mi experiencia con la publicación en Alemania no es que con escribir libros se
gana dinero - menos algunas pocas personas muy exitosas. De todas formas, si
con la edición en castellano de la novela  llegare a tener ganancias
financieras, yo entregaría el dinero equivalente que salió del crowdfunding a
comunidades en el Bajo Atrato para que lo usen, por ejemplo, para sus
propuestas educativas. </p>
<h3><b>Desafíos
y trabajo a hacer: </b></h3>
<p>Muchos
todavía... Terminar la traducción, ponerse de acuerdo con la editorial sobre
las condiciones, revisar la versión final, hacer llegar el libro a las
comunidades, lograr la difusión en Colombia y fuera de Colombia. Confío en que
todo esto se va a lograr, dado que, además, hay muchos amigos y amigas rodeándome,
que están convencidos de que sacar esta traducción es importante (y están con
ganas, ell@s mism@s, de leer el libro). Agradecimientos especiales a Christine Weisser, Christiane
Schwarz, Roberto Montoya, Gloria Montoya, Helmut y Franziska Goebels, Ana María Lozano, de la Comisión Intereclesial
Danilo Rueda y Abilio Peña y
much@s otr@s por darme ánimo y apoyo en varios sentidos!! Además mis
agradecimientos van a la comunidad en Cacarica que me recibió y me permitió
conocer y aprender.  <br/></p>
<h2><b>¡Ayúdame
a difundir la campaña!</b></h2>
<p>Si
mucha gente hace una aportación pequeña, no es muy difícil lograr la meta. Ayúdame
a difundir la campaña, mándala a tus amig@s por email, facebook, twitter - lo
que tengas!! </p>
<h3><b>¿Cuándo
sale la traducción como radio novela?</b></h3>
<p>Creo
que mucha gente en el Chocó no lee tanto y transformar la novela en
radio-novela sería mucho mejor :-). Mi sueño sería que esto se haga después, sin
embargo, hasta ahora es un sueño y por lo tanto no tiene fecha. </p><div>

<h2>Die Geschichten an die Menschen in Kolumbien zurückgeben:
Spanische Übersetzung des Romans ""Marielas Traum""</h2>
<p> ""Marielas Traum"" ist ein Roman über Vertreibung, Kampf um das Land und Hoffnung in Kolumbien. Die Übersetzung ins Spanische soll es auch den Menschen in Kolumbien ermöglichen, ihn zu lesen - und soll einen  Beitrag zu Erinnerungsarbeit und Gerechtigkeit in Kolumbien leisten. <br/></p>
<p> Basierend
auf meinen Erfahrungen und auf den Geschichten der Leute habe ich diesen Roman
geschrieben, der sehr dicht an der Realität angelehnt ist. Ich habe ihn auf Deutsch
geschrieben und Ende 2014 publiziert. Es gibt einen Verlag in Kolumbien, der
jedoch nicht die Kosten für die Übersetzung übernimmt. Ich brauche noch die
1.500 € von diesem Crowdfunding und kann die außerdem noch benötigten 1.500 €
selbst bezahlen. </p>
<h3>Marielas Traum“  - eine fiktive
Geschichte, die sich doch genau so zugetragen haben könnte 

</h3>
<p>Schon Marielas Eltern haben an den Ufern des
Chitandó, im kolumbianischen Dschungel, ein Stück Land urbar gemacht. Mariela
wächst dort auf. Doch rechte Paramilitärs dringen in die Region vor. Brutal
vertreiben die bewaffneten Männer die Menschen aus Marielas Dorf. Und Oberst
Montenegro und sein Verbündeter Héctor setzen alles daran, dass die
Dorfbewohner niemals an den Chitandó zurückkehren. </p>
<p>Doch Mariela und die
Menschen aus ihrem Dorf sind nicht allein. Der Anwalt Felipe hilft ihnen, das
Recht auf ihr Land einzuklagen. Felipe will die Verantwortlichen für Mord und
Vertreibung vor Gericht bringen. Damit fordert er mächtige Interessen heraus.
Wie gefährlich das ist, erkennt auch die junge Deutsche Beata. Sie war nur für
ein Praktikum bei Felipes Organisation nach Kolumbien gekommen. Aber die Menschen
vom Chitandó wachsen Beata ans Herz. Und ihr wird klar, dass die
Palmölplantagen, die auf dem geraubten Land angelegt werden, auch für den
europäischen Markt produzieren. </p>
<p>Roman von Alexandra Huck. </p>
<h3><b>Warum ist es wichtig, den Roman zu
übersetzen?</b></h3>
<p>Um den Menschen in Kolumbien und im Chocó ihre Geschichten
zurückzugeben – in ihrer Sprache! Und damit er auch von Menschen an vielen
anderen Orten in Kolumbien und außerhalb gelesen werden kann. </p>
<p>(dt. Fassung Paperback, 472 Seiten, 14,90 Euro, ISBN 978-3-7357-9470-3,
auch als eBook) </p>
<p><i>„Für Land zu
kämpfen sollte ebenso wichtig sein, wie darum zu kämpfen, dass die Geschichte
des Kampfes um Land erzählt wird: das ist Kultur.“ Patricia Ariza im Interview
in ‚<span>Mujeres. Paz, Política y Poder’ (2016)</span></i></p>
<p><i>„In diesem Moment, in dem in Kolumbien ein
Schritt zum Frieden hin stattfindet, sind die Erzählungen von den Verbrechen,
aber auch von den Formen des Widerstandes dagegen entscheidend für Veränderung.
Es reicht nicht, die Fakten zu darzustellen. Sie nachzuempfinden, in einem
Roman wie diesem, erlaubt uns, uns neu zu denken und von der Überwindung unseres
Unglücks zu träumen“,</i></p>
<p><i>sagt </i>Abilio
Peña von der Organisation „Comisión Intereclesial de Justicia y Paz“.</p>
<p><i>„Es ist sehr wichtig, dass die Geschichten
und Wahrheiten der Leute endlich gehört und ihre Erlebnisse gewürdigt werden,
für Heilung und zum Aufbau neuer Beziehungen zwischen den
Menschen. Beim Lesen des Romans konnte ich die Beklemmung, Hoffnungen, Freude
und die Ohnmacht der Leute spüren, das Pochen des Dschungels im Chocó. Das hat
mir erlaubt meine Sinne und mein Herz zu öffnen für diese Realitäten, die in
Kolumbien und an vielen Orten dieser Erde existieren“, </i></p>
<p>sagt<i> </i>Christine
Weisser, frühere Koordinatorin von PBI-Kolumbien (Peace Brigades International),
Coach für psychosoziale Begleitung und Gestalttherapeutin. </p>
<p>(s. links weiter unten zu Rezensionen auf
Deutsch sowie zu Radiointerview auf Spanisch mit Contagio Radio mit Alexandra
Huck und Christine Weisser).</p>
<h3><b>Wie ist der Roman entstanden? </b></h3>
<p>Mein Name ist Alexandra Huck und ich habe in
den Jahren 1999/2000 mit Peace Brigades International in Urabá/ Kolumbien gearbeitet.
Seither habe ich verfolgt, was dort geschieht und habe die Region immer wieder
besucht. Irgendwann schien mir, dass es nicht genügt, die Geschichten von dort
in immer neuen Menschenrechtsberichten zu erfassen und dass auch nicht viele
Menschen solche Berichte lesen wollen – zumal ich selbst viel lieber einen
Roman über das lese, was mich interessiert. Der Kampf der Menschen in Urabá um
ihr Land, so schien mir, gleicht in der Realität schon oft einem Politthriller,
den nur noch jemand zu Papier bringen müsste. </p>
<p>Ich habe mich daran gemacht, das zu tun. Ich
bin nach Kolumbien zurückgekehrt und war zwei Monate in einem Dorf in Cacarica,
im Dschungel, um noch mehr Geschichten zu hören und um den Geschmack, den Duft,
die Farben und Geräusche aufzusaugen, die mir noch fehlten. Ich habe einige
Jahre gebraucht, um den Roman zu schreiben und ihn dann im November 2014 in
Deutschland veröffentlicht (472 Seiten, bei BoD). Der Roman ist eng an die
Realität angelehnt. Ich konnte ihn nur in meiner Muttersprache schreiben. Doch
von Anfang an haben Menschen in Kolumbien, vor allem aus den Gemeinden, aber
auch aus anderen Gegenden, gesagt, dass sie den Roman auch lesen wollen. Das
finde ich nur fair! Menschen in Deutschland und der Schweiz, die den Roman
kennen, haben mich ermutigt, für eine Übersetzung zu sorgen – auch als eine
Form des Gedenkens und Erinnerns an die Ereignisse. </p>
<h2><b>Wofür wird
das Geld des Crowdfunding verwendet<span>?</span></b></h2>
<p>Mit der Hilfe eines Freundes, an den mich die
Organisation„Comisión Intereclesial de Justicia y Paz“ weiterempfohlen hat,
habe ich einen kolumbianischen Verlag gefunden, der den Roman veröffentlichen
will - wenn ich für die Übersetzung sorge. Die deutsche Fassung ist im
Self-Publishing erschienen, und ohne Verlagshaus im Rücken ist es schwierig,
eine Übersetzung zu ermöglichen. Eine gute professionelle Übersetzung – und
etwas anderes macht keinen Sinn – kostet 7.000 Euros. Die Übersetzerin ist
Kolumbianerin, lebt in Bogotá, kennt den Chocó, das Thema Vertreibung und seine
Auswirkungen. Auf anderen Wegen habe ich bereits 4.000 Euros für die
Finanzierung zusammenbekommen und selbst kann ich noch 1.500 Euro beisteuern.
Daher fehlen mir noch die 1.500 Euro dieser Crowdfunding-Kampagne, damit wir
die Übersetzung zu Ende bringen können. Alles Geld aus dem Crowdfunding dient
dazu, die Übersetzung zu bezahlen. Der Roman soll dann gedruckt erscheinen und
im Handel erhältlich sein, aber selbstverständlich werde ich auch dafür sorgen,
dass die Gemeinden, die mich für den Roman inspiriert haben, ebenfalls
Buchexemplare erhalten. </p>
<h4><b>Wenn Du kein
Paypal oder eine Kreditkarte nutzt und mitmachen sowie eines der Dankeschöns
erhalten willst, dann schreib mir an post(a)alexandrahuck.de und ich schicke
Dir die Bankdaten.</b></h4>
<p>Mit Constanza Vieira haben wir die richtige
Übersetzerin gefunden. Sie hat ein Probekapitel übersetzt, aus dem ich im
Februar 2016 in Cacarica lesen durfte.</p>
<h3><b>Wann wird die Übersetzung veröffentlicht? </b></h3>
<p>Wir haben schon mit der Übersetzung angefangen
und wir hoffen das Buch im Februar 2017 veröffentlichen zu können, zum 20.
Jahrestag der „Operation Genesis“, einem realen Ereignis, das u.a. als Vorlage
für den Roman gedient hat. Der Zeitplan ist ehrgeizig, denn es gibt bis dahin
noch viel zu tun: Übersetzung, Korrektur, Layout und Druck... </p>
<h3><b>Was ist, wenn der Roman in Kolumbien sehr
erfolgreich wird und die Autorin damit eine Menge Geld verdient? </b></h3>
<p>Meine Erfahrung mit der Veröffentlichung
in Deutschland ist nicht, dass man mit einer Buchveröffentlichung Geld
verdienen kann – außer einigen wenigen Autor*innen. Sollte ich jedoch mit der
spanischen Fassung Geld verdienen, dann würde ich den Betrag, den ich über das
Crowdfunding gesammelt habe, an Gemeinden im Gebiet des „Bajo Atrato“ spenden,
damit sie es beispielsweise für ihre eigenen Bildungsprojekte nutzen können. </p>
<h3><b>Herausforderungen
und was noch zu tun ist</b></h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>Ziemlich viel... Erst einmal die Übersetzung
fertig bekommen, mit dem Verlag über die Konditionen verhandeln, die Endversion
durchsehen, das Buch den Gemeinden zukommen lassen, für die Verbreitung in
Kolumbien und darüber hinaus sorgen. Ich habe Vertrauen, das zu schaffen, vor
allem weil ich von vielen Freund*innen begleitet werde, die davon überzeugt
sind, dass es wichtig ist, diese Übersetzung herauszubringen (und die Lust
haben, das Buch selbst auf Spanisch lesen zu können). </p>
<p>Ganz besonderer Dank geht an Christine
Weisser, Christiane Schwarz, Roberto Montoya, Gloria Montoya, Helmut und
Franziska Göbels, Ana María Lozano und von der „Comisión Intereclesial de
Justicia y Paz“ an Danilo Rueda und Abilio Peña sowie an ganz viele weitere
Freund*innen, die mich ermutigt und in vielerlei Hinsicht unterstützt haben.
Vor allem geht mein Dank an die Menschen von CAVIDA in Cacarica, die mich
aufgenommen und mir erlaubt haben von ihnen zu lernen. <br/></p>

Internacionales de Paz) en el año 1999/2000 y desde entonces he estado al tanto
de lo que sucede en la región y he realizado varias visitas. En algún momento
pensé que contar las historias de allá en el marco de más informes de derechos
humanos no era suficiente, ni iba a llegar a muchas personas, ya que yo misma
prefiero leer una novela sobre algo que me interesa. A la vez, la lucha de la
gente por su territorio  muchas veces parecía una verdadera novela de
suspense plasmada en la vida real, que solo faltaba poner en papel.
Decidí
emprender esto, regresé a Colombia y me quedé ocho semanas en Cacarica para todavía
conocer más historias, e impregnarme de los sabores, colores y sonidos que me
faltaban. Demoré unos años en escribir y publiqué la novela en Alemania en
noviembre 2014 con sus 472 páginas. Sólo pude escribir esa “obra de ficción
real” en mi propio idioma, el alemán, no obstante, desde el principio me llegó
el reclamo de que la gente en Colombia -y en otras partes- quería leerla
también. ¡Me parece más que justo! Las personas en Alemania y Suiza que han
podido leerla me animaron mucho a traducirla, como un paso más para hacer
memoria. 
¿A
qué va el dinero del crowdfunding?
Con
la ayuda de un amigo recomendado por la Comisión Intereclesial de Justicia y
Paz encontré una editorial que quiere publicar la novela, siempre y cuando yo me
haga cargo de obtener una buena traducción. La versión alemana salió en
self-publishing, y sin casa editorial alemana es más difícil conseguir la
traducción. Para una traducción buena y profesional -y otra cosa no tiene
sentido- el costo total llega a 7.000 Euros. La traductora es Colombiana, vive
en Bogotá, conoce el Chocó y la problemática del desplazamiento y sus impactos.
Por iniciativa propia ya conseguí 4.000 Euros de financiación y yo estoy
dispuesta a poner otros 1.500. Por ende, me faltan los 1.500 Euros de esta
campaña de crowdfunding para terminar la traducción. Ya hemos empezado y
queremos tener el libro publicado en febrero de 2017, cuando se conmemoran 20 años
de los hechos reales (la Operación Génesis en el Cacarica), con los cuales se
relaciona esta novela. 
Todo
el dinero del Crowdfunding va para el pago de la traducción. Se espera que la
novela salga impresa y a librerías y, obviamente, estoy muy pendiente de
asegurar que a las comunidades que conozco y me inspiraron lleguen también ejemplares. Si no usas paypal o tarjeta crédito y quieres contribuir y tener la recompensa respectiva contactame a post(a)alexandrahuck.de y te mando los datos de banco. 
En
Constanza Viera encontramos a una persona capaz de hacer la traducción. Ella tradujo
un capítulo de prueba, que tuve el honor de leer parcialmente en Cacarica,
Chocó en febrero 2016. ¿Cuándo
se publica la traducción? 
¡Ya
hemos avanzado y queremos tener el libro listo para publicación en febrero
2017!!! Es ambicioso, porque mientras tanto hay que hacer la traducción,
revisión, corrección de estilo, diseño, diagramación, impresión... 
¿Y
qué pasa en caso de que la novela sea un super-éxito y la autora termina
ganando mucho dinero con ella? 
Pues,
mi experiencia con la publicación en Alemania no es que con escribir libros se
gana dinero - menos algunas pocas personas muy exitosas. De todas formas, si
con la edición en castellano de la novela  llegare a tener ganancias
financieras, yo entregaría el dinero equivalente que salió del crowdfunding a
comunidades en el Bajo Atrato para que lo usen, por ejemplo, para sus
propuestas educativas. 
Desafíos
y trabajo a hacer: 
Muchos
todavía... Terminar la traducción, ponerse de acuerdo con la editorial sobre
las condiciones, revisar la versión final, hacer llegar el libro a las
comunidades, lograr la difusión en Colombia y fuera de Colombia. Confío en que
todo esto se va a lograr, dado que, además, hay muchos amigos y amigas rodeándome,
que están convencidos de que sacar esta traducción es importante (y están con
ganas, ell@s mism@s, de leer el libro). Agradecimientos especiales a Christine Weisser, Christiane
Schwarz, Roberto Montoya, Gloria Montoya, Helmut y Franziska Goebels, Ana María Lozano, de la Comisión Intereclesial
Danilo Rueda y Abilio Peña y
much@s otr@s por darme ánimo y apoyo en varios sentidos!! Además mis
agradecimientos van a la comunidad en Cacarica que me recibió y me permitió
conocer y aprender.  
¡Ayúdame
a difundir la campaña!
Si
mucha gente hace una aportación pequeña, no es muy difícil lograr la meta. Ayúdame
a difundir la campaña, mándala a tus amig@s por email, facebook, twitter - lo
que tengas!! 
¿Cuándo
sale la traducción como radio novela?
Creo
que mucha gente en el Chocó no lee tanto y transformar la novela en
radio-novela sería mucho mejor :-). Mi sueño sería que esto se haga después, sin
embargo, hasta ahora es un sueño y por lo tanto no tiene fecha.

Die Geschichten an die Menschen in Kolumbien zurückgeben:
Spanische Übersetzung des Romans ""Marielas Traum""
 ""Marielas Traum"" ist ein Roman über Vertreibung, Kampf um das Land und Hoffnung in Kolumbien. Die Übersetzung ins Spanische soll es auch den Menschen in Kolumbien ermöglichen, ihn zu lesen - und soll einen  Beitrag zu Erinnerungsarbeit und Gerechtigkeit in Kolumbien leisten. 
 Basierend
auf meinen Erfahrungen und auf den Geschichten der Leute habe ich diesen Roman
geschrieben, der sehr dicht an der Realität angelehnt ist. Ich habe ihn auf Deutsch
geschrieben und Ende 2014 publiziert. Es gibt einen Verlag in Kolumbien, der
jedoch nicht die Kosten für die Übersetzung übernimmt. Ich brauche noch die
1.500 € von diesem Crowdfunding und kann die außerdem noch benötigten 1.500 €
selbst bezahlen. 
Marielas Traum“  - eine fiktive
Geschichte, die sich doch genau so zugetragen haben könnte 


Schon Marielas Eltern haben an den Ufern des
Chitandó, im kolumbianischen Dschungel, ein Stück Land urbar gemacht. Mariela
wächst dort auf. Doch rechte Paramilitärs dringen in die Region vor. Brutal
vertreiben die bewaffneten Männer die Menschen aus Marielas Dorf. Und Oberst
Montenegro und sein Verbündeter Héctor setzen alles daran, dass die
Dorfbewohner niemals an den Chitandó zurückkehren. 
Doch Mariela und die
Menschen aus ihrem Dorf sind nicht allein. Der Anwalt Felipe hilft ihnen, das
Recht auf ihr Land einzuklagen. Felipe will die Verantwortlichen für Mord und
Vertreibung vor Gericht bringen. Damit fordert er mächtige Interessen heraus.
Wie gefährlich das ist, erkennt auch die junge Deutsche Beata. Sie war nur für
ein Praktikum bei Felipes Organisation nach Kolumbien gekommen. Aber die Menschen
vom Chitandó wachsen Beata ans Herz. Und ihr wird klar, dass die
Palmölplantagen, die auf dem geraubten Land angelegt werden, auch für den
europäischen Markt produzieren. 
Roman von Alexandra Huck. 
Warum ist es wichtig, den Roman zu
übersetzen?
Um den Menschen in Kolumbien und im Chocó ihre Geschichten
zurückzugeben – in ihrer Sprache! Und damit er auch von Menschen an vielen
anderen Orten in Kolumbien und außerhalb gelesen werden kann. 
(dt. Fassung Paperback, 472 Seiten, 14,90 Euro, ISBN 978-3-7357-9470-3,
auch als eBook) 
„Für Land zu
kämpfen sollte ebenso wichtig sein, wie darum zu kämpfen, dass die Geschichte
des Kampfes um Land erzählt wird: das ist Kultur.“ Patricia Ariza im Interview
in ‚Mujeres. Paz, Política y Poder’ (2016)
„In diesem Moment, in dem in Kolumbien ein
Schritt zum Frieden hin stattfindet, sind die Erzählungen von den Verbrechen,
aber auch von den Formen des Widerstandes dagegen entscheidend für Veränderung.
Es reicht nicht, die Fakten zu darzustellen. Sie nachzuempfinden, in einem
Roman wie diesem, erlaubt uns, uns neu zu denken und von der Überwindung unseres
Unglücks zu träumen“,
sagt Abilio
Peña von der Organisation „Comisión Intereclesial de Justicia y Paz“.
„Es ist sehr wichtig, dass die Geschichten
und Wahrheiten der Leute endlich gehört und ihre Erlebnisse gewürdigt werden,
für Heilung und zum Aufbau neuer Beziehungen zwischen den
Menschen. Beim Lesen des Romans konnte ich die Beklemmung, Hoffnungen, Freude
und die Ohnmacht der Leute spüren, das Pochen des Dschungels im Chocó. Das hat
mir erlaubt meine Sinne und mein Herz zu öffnen für diese Realitäten, die in
Kolumbien und an vielen Orten dieser Erde existieren“, 
sagt Christine
Weisser, frühere Koordinatorin von PBI-Kolumbien (Peace Brigades International),
Coach für psychosoziale Begleitung und Gestalttherapeutin. 
(s. links weiter unten zu Rezensionen auf
Deutsch sowie zu Radiointerview auf Spanisch mit Contagio Radio mit Alexandra
Huck und Christine Weisser).
Wie ist der Roman entstanden? 
Mein Name ist Alexandra Huck und ich habe in
den Jahren 1999/2000 mit Peace Brigades International in Urabá/ Kolumbien gearbeitet.
Seither habe ich verfolgt, was dort geschieht und habe die Region immer wieder
besucht. Irgendwann schien mir, dass es nicht genügt, die Geschichten von dort
in immer neuen Menschenrechtsberichten zu erfassen und dass auch nicht viele
Menschen solche Berichte lesen wollen – zumal ich selbst viel lieber einen
Roman über das lese, was mich interessiert. Der Kampf der Menschen in Urabá um
ihr Land, so schien mir, gleicht in der Realität schon oft einem Politthriller,
den nur noch jemand zu Papier bringen müsste. 
Ich habe mich daran gemacht, das zu tun. Ich
bin nach Kolumbien zurückgekehrt und war zwei Monate in einem Dorf in Cacarica,
im Dschungel, um noch mehr Geschichten zu hören und um den Geschmack, den Duft,
die Farben und Geräusche aufzusaugen, die mir noch fehlten. Ich habe einige
Jahre gebraucht, um den Roman zu schreiben und ihn dann im November 2014 in
Deutschland veröffentlicht (472 Seiten, bei BoD). Der Roman ist eng an die
Realität angelehnt. Ich konnte ihn nur in meiner Muttersprache schreiben. Doch
von Anfang an haben Menschen in Kolumbien, vor allem aus den Gemeinden, aber
auch aus anderen Gegenden, gesagt, dass sie den Roman auch lesen wollen. Das
finde ich nur fair! Menschen in Deutschland und der Schweiz, die den Roman
kennen, haben mich ermutigt, für eine Übersetzung zu sorgen – auch als eine
Form des Gedenkens und Erinnerns an die Ereignisse. 
Wofür wird
das Geld des Crowdfunding verwendet?
Mit der Hilfe eines Freundes, an den mich die
Organisation„Comisión Intereclesial de Justicia y Paz“ weiterempfohlen hat,
habe ich einen kolumbianischen Verlag gefunden, der den Roman veröffentlichen
will - wenn ich für die Übersetzung sorge. Die deutsche Fassung ist im
Self-Publishing erschienen, und ohne Verlagshaus im Rücken ist es schwierig,
eine Übersetzung zu ermöglichen. Eine gute professionelle Übersetzung – und
etwas anderes macht keinen Sinn – kostet 7.000 Euros. Die Übersetzerin ist
Kolumbianerin, lebt in Bogotá, kennt den Chocó, das Thema Vertreibung und seine
Auswirkungen. Auf anderen Wegen habe ich bereits 4.000 Euros für die
Finanzierung zusammenbekommen und selbst kann ich noch 1.500 Euro beisteuern.
Daher fehlen mir noch die 1.500 Euro dieser Crowdfunding-Kampagne, damit wir
die Übersetzung zu Ende bringen können. Alles Geld aus dem Crowdfunding dient
dazu, die Übersetzung zu bezahlen. Der Roman soll dann gedruckt erscheinen und
im Handel erhältlich sein, aber selbstverständlich werde ich auch dafür sorgen,
dass die Gemeinden, die mich für den Roman inspiriert haben, ebenfalls
Buchexemplare erhalten. 
Wenn Du kein
Paypal oder eine Kreditkarte nutzt und mitmachen sowie eines der Dankeschöns
erhalten willst, dann schreib mir an post(a)alexandrahuck.de und ich schicke
Dir die Bankdaten.
Mit Constanza Vieira haben wir die richtige
Übersetzerin gefunden. Sie hat ein Probekapitel übersetzt, aus dem ich im
Februar 2016 in Cacarica lesen durfte.
Wann wird die Übersetzung veröffentlicht? 
Wir haben schon mit der Übersetzung angefangen
und wir hoffen das Buch im Februar 2017 veröffentlichen zu können, zum 20.
Jahrestag der „Operation Genesis“, einem realen Ereignis, das u.a. als Vorlage
für den Roman gedient hat. Der Zeitplan ist ehrgeizig, denn es gibt bis dahin
noch viel zu tun: Übersetzung, Korrektur, Layout und Druck... 
Was ist, wenn der Roman in Kolumbien sehr
erfolgreich wird und die Autorin damit eine Menge Geld verdient? 
Meine Erfahrung mit der Veröffentlichung
in Deutschland ist nicht, dass man mit einer Buchveröffentlichung Geld
verdienen kann – außer einigen wenigen Autor*innen. Sollte ich jedoch mit der
spanischen Fassung Geld verdienen, dann würde ich den Betrag, den ich über das
Crowdfunding gesammelt habe, an Gemeinden im Gebiet des „Bajo Atrato“ spenden,
damit sie es beispielsweise für ihre eigenen Bildungsprojekte nutzen können. 
Herausforderungen
und was noch zu tun ist


Ziemlich viel... Erst einmal die Übersetzung
fertig bekommen, mit dem Verlag über die Konditionen verhandeln, die Endversion
durchsehen, das Buch den Gemeinden zukommen lassen, für die Verbreitung in
Kolumbien und darüber hinaus sorgen. Ich habe Vertrauen, das zu schaffen, vor
allem weil ich von vielen Freund*innen begleitet werde, die davon überzeugt
sind, dass es wichtig ist, diese Übersetzung herauszubringen (und die Lust
haben, das Buch selbst auf Spanisch lesen zu können). 
Ganz besonderer Dank geht an Christine
Weisser, Christiane Schwarz, Roberto Montoya, Gloria Montoya, Helmut und
Franziska Göbels, Ana María Lozano und von der „Comisión Intereclesial de
Justicia y Paz“ an Danilo Rueda und Abilio Peña sowie an ganz viele weitere
Freund*innen, die mich ermutigt und in vielerlei Hinsicht unterstützt haben.
Vor allem geht mein Dank an die Menschen von CAVIDA in Cacarica, die mich
aufgenommen und mir erlaubt haben von ihnen zu lernen.

erscheint die spanische Fassung als Hörspiel? 
Ich denke, dass viele Leute im Chocó nicht viel
lesen und mein Traum ist daher, dass das Buch auch in eine Hörspiel-Serie verwandelt
wird. Aber bisher ist das ein Traum und hat kein Datum.

<p>When I was a kid, my house was filled with music. My parents didn't just play the music they grew up with in the 60's, they also introduced me to the music their parents grew up with. Yes, I would throw in my hip-hop cassette tapes, but my mom would put on old Motown records and my dad would throw a '45 on the phonograph and talk about his parents generation. Listening to music from so many time periods not only brought us closer together but it also gave us a platform to talk about what the musicians were saying. I remember when my mom sat me down in second grade to listen to the lyrics of John Lennon's 'Imagine' and talk about what it meant and my place in the world. I made 'Dream On' because I firmly believe in connecting through music and talking about an artist's message and social impact.

<h3>The Art</h3>
<p>The best part of making this book has been researching and listening to a ton of classic songs and artists and integrating them into my story. I've spent so much time listening to old music and drawing and I have to say this has probably been the most enjoyable project I've ever taken on.</p>
<p><strong>Posters:</strong><br/>Designing the wall posters for the book was a really fun challenge. Each poster was its own small little art project. I would do a little research on the artist, open up spotify and then start drawing. (So much fun, I could do this all day). Here's a time lapse video of drawing the posters if you want to see the process in action:</p>

The best part of making this book has been researching and listening to a ton of classic songs and artists and integrating them into my story. I've spent so much time listening to old music and drawing and I have to say this has probably been the most enjoyable project I've ever taken on.
Posters:Designing the wall posters for the book was a really fun challenge. Each poster was its own small little art project. I would do a little research on the artist, open up spotify and then start drawing. (So much fun, I could do this all day). Here's a time lapse video of drawing the posters if you want to see the process in action:


 

Characters:Here's a glimpse of the main characters.The Music:An eclectic variety of musicians, genres and styles are fully represented in 'Dream On'. I also incorporated as many historically relevant artists as I could into the backgrounds with band posters, and other hidden tributes throughout the book. From Ella Fitzgerald to Black Sabbath you're bound to rediscover some of your favorite songs from the 50's, 60's and 70's.*Some folks have asked if the actual music will be included alongside the book or ebook. I am not reselling any music, however a spotify playlist will be available to those who want to experience the book with accompanying music. 


About the Author
Hi guys! My name is Josh Tuininga. I'm a multi-media artist living in the great Pacific NW. You may know me from my first children's book Why Blue?, my design company The Medium, or other art projects that have come out of my Bluebird Bus art studio. Whatever the case - thanks for supporting my Indiegogo Project!You can learn more about me at my website: BlueBusArt.comMy kids and I performing at an open mic in Chelan, WA.

Public Domain & Fair Use
A lot of people ask if it's legal to use song names and artist names in the book. YES! All artist names and song titles are printed in accordance with fair use or public domain. Internet research wasn't good enough for me so I met with the lawyers at WLA (Washington Lawyers for the Arts) and they confirmed that song titles and artist names are not protected under copyright law. The U.S. Copyright Office has never found that a title of any length could be successfully registered for copyright protection. 

Thank You!!!Thanks to you all for your continued support of my art projects throughout the years. I'm very excited about this one.  -Josh",17.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>Mewow is a hero protecting her fellow animal friends. Ohno is a very small, damaged, and tailless cat who wants nothing more than to be a hero just like her. One day, Mewow is captured by the evil dog-villian Gruffigus. Now Ohno's chance to prove he can be a Supercat too!</p>

<h3>The Meaning</h3>
<p>Supercats is a read-out-load board book for pre-K to K kids just learning to read. The target range age is 1-5. It's a blast to read with your little one, and it's a heartfelt story about how differences don't make you less capable of achieving greatness.</p>
<p>Ohno is a disadvantaged creature. He has no tail. He's clumsy and very small, but he uses the skills and unique abilities he does have to become a superhero. I belive it's important to tell our children they are not only unique, but that their uniqueness is what makes them great.</p>
<p>Children love the charming characters here and I guarantee they will want to read it over and over again! </p>

<h3>Something Special</h3>
<p>I wrote this story hoping it would be become something different. I've read many, many kid's books over the past two years. I've seen nothing out there that introduces the comic book structure or style in this way other than Captain Underpants. I'm hoping this book will be a bridge to bring new readers to comics by showing them what they are and why they are so fun at an early age.</p>
<p>I have been taking samples of the book around with me to conventions and kids are drawn to the bright colors and beautiful artwork. There's nothing more gratifying that watching kids run up to your table and grab your book. They want to read it, and there have been many times that they stop in the middle of a convention and read it all the way through.</p>
<p>The amazing artist, Angela Oddling has not only contributed by drawing all of these fantastic pages, but her unique style and charm has made Supercats something truly special. </p>
<p>I'm certain anyone and everyone will find something to fall in love with this silly, beautiful book. It's a joy to read with it's simple rhyming story and loveable characters, and although it's simple and created for children just learning to read, the gorgeous art and whimsical tone is sure to capture the heart of anyone who reads it. </p>

<h3>The Beginning</h3>
<p>I have been making comics for the past 3 years now, and they have all been dark stories targeted at a teen to adult audience.  2 years ago I became a parent. I'm now a full-time father and comic creator, but now that I have a son to care for every day, I wanted to create something I can read with him; something he and I can both enjoy together.</p>
<p>Supercats is just the beginning. This is a story based on characters I created while playing with stuffed animal cats with my son. It's mainly just silly and fun, but I hope it's something everyone can enjoy. This series will evolve with my son. I am currently planning to create a series of 3 board books that increase in reading difficulty. </p>
<p>After these books are complete, Supercats will evolve into an all ages comic!</p>
<p>Hopefully fans and young readers will love these characters as much as we do and want to read, grow, and learn along with us. </p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Mi querida araña </strong>nos ofrece una historia de renacimiento, de la toma de conciencia de lo efímero de la existencia, apoyándose en lo que bien podría ser una trama de madurez de la protagonista.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Imagina que tienes una existencia normal, una rutina marcada… y que, de repente, te detectan una enfermedad grave. ¿Cómo sería tu vida si te dijeran que tienes un tumor cerebral a los veinticinco años? ¿Seguirías considerando «importantes» las mismas cosas? ¿Tendrías un punto de vista mucho más relativo acerca de los problemas cotidianos? Pocas veces nos detenemos a pensar por qué somos así o vivimos tal como lo hacemos, hasta que, ante esta incapacidad nuestra de pararnos a analizar quiénes somos o hacia dónde vamos, la vida misma lo hace por nosotros: nos detiene.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia</strong> es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionales pero de indudable calidad, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para promocionar cada título cuando esta todavía se encuentra en proceso de edición.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy se nos presenta <strong>Ana Sieben</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nacida en un pueblo con pretensiones cosmopolitas (Elche), en la costa levantina, nunca disfruté de su playa porque acentuaba mi innata, involuntaria e inexplicable nostalgia. Cursé estudios de Traducción en la Universidad de Alicante tras comprender en la temprana adolescencia que el sueño americano probablemente solo existía en las películas hollywoodienses que ya hace mucho que dejaron de contentar mi gusto y expectativas y aquello del inglés teórico era a lo mucho que podía aspirar; por eso, y porque me considero adoradora de la expresión escrita en su original forma (para vencer al enemigo, únete a él). Soy rescatadora de libros de contenedores azules —el doble <i>ci(n)vismo</i>— porque me entristecen las historias perdidas y encontradas. Compagino mi trabajo (por necesidad) con mi pasión por la lectura y la escritura —tanto más necesarias—, pues son los únicos remedios que mantienen a raya mi inconformismo, mi desazón.</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Lo que pasó después de ese día de luces y sombras y fogonazos cadmios me dejó hecha polvo. Por la mañana, vinieron dos enfermeras muy jóvenes y me despertaron, no sé muy bien lo que me dijeron, pero las veía con intención de mover algo inamovible: mi cuerpo. Me quitaron la sonda y me cogieron por las axilas. Entre las dos, me llevaron al baño y, después, al sentarme en un taburete de plástico, me ordenaron que me bañara yo sola. Mi primera reacción fue reírme sin poder. Me reí internamente, claro, porque me dolía todo el cuerpo, y el uso de cualquier músculo facial (o el que fuera) me inducía tal sufrimiento que tuve que ahogar la risa; en serio, no podía ni esbozar una sonrisa. Dolía. Aún tenía los ojos muy cerrados, no tenía fuerza para mantenerlos abiertos; me dolía mantenerlos abiertos. En un esfuerzo titánico los medio entorné y me miré al espejo. Dios mío, lo que vi en ese momento —aunque corto— me dejó tan pasmada que no me atreví a mirarme otra vez. Mi pelo era una maraña marrón abigarrada que luchaba por alejarse de la herida abierta en la cabeza. Tenía la cara entre amarilla y naranja, llena de yodo o lo que eso fuera, y también chorretones secos por los hombros; la piel surcada de heridas y moretones. Mis perennes y heredadas ojeras se habían intensificado y tenían un color retinto, pese a haber estado casi dos días inconsciente. Aparte, tenía vías en ambas manos, el antebrazo, y el cuello. Ya está, no acerté a ver nada más o, mejor dicho, no me atreví a mirar nada más. Me froté un poco el pecho con la manopla que me dieron y, cuando ellas, que me vigilaban, consideraron ya que lo que yo había hecho era ducharme, me pusieron un pijama de Mickey que me había comprado (azul, muy bonito), y me sentaron en la silla de la habitación junto a la mesa. No sé cuánto tiempo estuve así, sentada y sin moverme, pero era de día, así que mis padres no tardarían en llegar.<br/>          No alcanzaba a ver qué hora era, os recuerdo que los músculos de mi cuello y mis hombros ya no funcionaban, y todos mis esfuerzos estaban concentrados, en ese momento, en mantenerme erguida en la silla. ¡Qué triste fue ese instante recordándolo ahora! Más triste fue notar que, a mi izquierda, se abría la puerta de la habitación y mi madre entraba al grito de ""¡Ana! ¡Ana! ¡Ana!"". Supongo que para mis padres fue un impacto fuerte. El día anterior había transcurrido sin que yo diera señales de vida: estaba medio muerta en la cama. Y, al día siguiente, me ven con ropa y sentada.

</div></div>","¿Qué?
Mi querida araña nos ofrece una historia de renacimiento, de la toma de conciencia de lo efímero de la existencia, apoyándose en lo que bien podría ser una trama de madurez de la protagonista.
Imagina que tienes una existencia normal, una rutina marcada… y que, de repente, te detectan una enfermedad grave. ¿Cómo sería tu vida si te dijeran que tienes un tumor cerebral a los veinticinco años? ¿Seguirías considerando «importantes» las mismas cosas? ¿Tendrías un punto de vista mucho más relativo acerca de los problemas cotidianos? Pocas veces nos detenemos a pensar por qué somos así o vivimos tal como lo hacemos, hasta que, ante esta incapacidad nuestra de pararnos a analizar quiénes somos o hacia dónde vamos, la vida misma lo hace por nosotros: nos detiene.
¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionales pero de indudable calidad, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para promocionar cada título cuando esta todavía se encuentra en proceso de edición.
De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy se nos presenta Ana Sieben.
Nacida en un pueblo con pretensiones cosmopolitas (Elche), en la costa levantina, nunca disfruté de su playa porque acentuaba mi innata, involuntaria e inexplicable nostalgia. Cursé estudios de Traducción en la Universidad de Alicante tras comprender en la temprana adolescencia que el sueño americano probablemente solo existía en las películas hollywoodienses que ya hace mucho que dejaron de contentar mi gusto y expectativas y aquello del inglés teórico era a lo mucho que podía aspirar; por eso, y porque me considero adoradora de la expresión escrita en su original forma (para vencer al enemigo, únete a él). Soy rescatadora de libros de contenedores azules —el doble ci(n)vismo— porque me entristecen las historias perdidas y encontradas. Compagino mi trabajo (por necesidad) con mi pasión por la lectura y la escritura —tanto más necesarias—, pues son los únicos remedios que mantienen a raya mi inconformismo, mi desazón.
¿Por qué?
Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:
«Lo que pasó después de ese día de luces y sombras y fogonazos cadmios me dejó hecha polvo. Por la mañana, vinieron dos enfermeras muy jóvenes y me despertaron, no sé muy bien lo que me dijeron, pero las veía con intención de mover algo inamovible: mi cuerpo. Me quitaron la sonda y me cogieron por las axilas. Entre las dos, me llevaron al baño y, después, al sentarme en un taburete de plástico, me ordenaron que me bañara yo sola. Mi primera reacción fue reírme sin poder. Me reí internamente, claro, porque me dolía todo el cuerpo, y el uso de cualquier músculo facial (o el que fuera) me inducía tal sufrimiento que tuve que ahogar la risa; en serio, no podía ni esbozar una sonrisa. Dolía. Aún tenía los ojos muy cerrados, no tenía fuerza para mantenerlos abiertos; me dolía mantenerlos abiertos. En un esfuerzo titánico los medio entorné y me miré al espejo. Dios mío, lo que vi en ese momento —aunque corto— me dejó tan pasmada que no me atreví a mirarme otra vez. Mi pelo era una maraña marrón abigarrada que luchaba por alejarse de la herida abierta en la cabeza. Tenía la cara entre amarilla y naranja, llena de yodo o lo que eso fuera, y también chorretones secos por los hombros; la piel surcada de heridas y moretones. Mis perennes y heredadas ojeras se habían intensificado y tenían un color retinto, pese a haber estado casi dos días inconsciente. Aparte, tenía vías en ambas manos, el antebrazo, y el cuello. Ya está, no acerté a ver nada más o, mejor dicho, no me atreví a mirar nada más. Me froté un poco el pecho con la manopla que me dieron y, cuando ellas, que me vigilaban, consideraron ya que lo que yo había hecho era ducharme, me pusieron un pijama de Mickey que me había comprado (azul, muy bonito), y me sentaron en la silla de la habitación junto a la mesa. No sé cuánto tiempo estuve así, sentada y sin moverme, pero era de día, así que mis padres no tardarían en llegar.          No alcanzaba a ver qué hora era, os recuerdo que los músculos de mi cuello y mis hombros ya no funcionaban, y todos mis esfuerzos estaban concentrados, en ese momento, en mantenerme erguida en la silla. ¡Qué triste fue ese instante recordándolo ahora! Más triste fue notar que, a mi izquierda, se abría la puerta de la habitación y mi madre entraba al grito de ""¡Ana! ¡Ana! ¡Ana!"". Supongo que para mis padres fue un impacto fuerte. El día anterior había transcurrido sin que yo diera señales de vida: estaba medio muerta en la cama. Y, al día siguiente, me ven con ropa y sentada. Vale, también tiene una parte bonita, lo reconozco. Pero lo más bonito fue intuir (no podía girarme para mirarla) a mi madre llorando de esperanza.          El día en que me levanté con ayuda de la cama por primera vez lo recordaré toda mi vida —tanta cuanta me quede—, pero no por el hecho de haberme movido, sino porque recibí una noticia que era totalmente contraria a mi estado. Mi prima Ainhoa estaba embarazada. Me llamaron por teléfono a mediodía. Yo no era capaz ni de sujetar el teléfono, así que mi madre lo puso en altavoz, y mi prima me dijo que los Reyes Magos le habían traído un regalo que sólo podría abrir en nueve meses. ¿Os imagináis qué pasó a continuación? Lloré, lloré, lloré y me deshice en lágrimas, como lo estoy haciendo ahora. Fui incapaz de retomar la conversación, así que mientras lloraba —silenciosamente, llorar también dolía— mi madre tomó el relevo y les contó mi estado y las últimas novedades. Lloré egoístamente, creo, y lo siento, pero lloré más por estar viva en ese cuatro de enero, porque una noticia de vida me rompió el alma en dos y me hacía debatirme entre la gratitud y el egoísmo, porque era vida lo que necesitaba, porque dos días después de haber visto a la muerte esta me mandó otra vez al mundo de los vivos (seguramente fue mi abuela, no lo sé, pero sé que ella no me dejaría formar parte del club).

En ese momento pensé que le contaría la historia (esta) a ese bebé precioso, que dentro de unos meses será una niña tan bonita como su madre.          Y eso es, precisamente, lo que intento».

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>The Greater Man</i> is the beginning of a dialogue on how young men should develop a healthy relationship with masculinity. This book pulls wisdom from many different cultures, time periods, and leaders to address their failures and build on their triumphs to create a productive relationship with masculinity.</p>
<p>My name is Anirudh Garg and I am the author of <i>The Greater Man</i>. I wrote this book because I saw firsthand the crisis of masculinity plaguing young men and I wanted to do my part to build a space for them to grow.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the first steps to a healthy relationship with masculinity. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for masculinity and how we can weaponize it against today’s greatest struggles. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand how connecting with your masculine traits responsibly will yield you dividends.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how young men should make their way through the world by investing in themselves and strengthening their communities. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>The time my friend gambled away his savings</li>
<li>The story of my Jiu Jitsu coach who found the American Dream</li>
<li>The story of how my grandfather survived an assassination attempt</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p>Is divided into three parts...</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Anirudh Garg is an economics student at the University of Texas at Dallas who will be graduating in the Spring of 2022. He is an assistant script writer for the Bollywood production house Amriki Talkies.<br/><br/>Anirudh Garg spent time tutoring and volunteering with youth and noticed a persistent issue in how young men were socialized by media and culture. “We send young men mixed messages about what it means to be a man. We tell them to be open and vulnerable, but don’t create a space for that to happen. This process leaves them emotionally maladjusted” -- Anirudh Garg. He wanted to delve deeper into the cultural understanding of masculinity and how it could be refined to aid young boys into manhood.<br/><br/>When he's not practicing mixed martial arts or writing, Anirudh works with Daniel Che as the co-host of 'The Dialectic', where he discusses political and cultural issues such as political philosophy and art critiques.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Anirudh Garg on...</p>

<h3><b>Here's My Story and I'm Sticking To It</b></h3>
<h4>Who am I<span style=""background-color: initial;"">? </span>
</h4>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My name is </span><b>Kellie Knight</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> and I write books.  In my search for finding a publishing company
to publish my first children’s book that I passionately worked on for years, I
ran into multiple road blocks. Suddenly, I had finally gotten to the point when it was time to
publish and I couldn't decide what the greater risk would be.  I stopped in my tracks and
thought, “I should publish this book myself.” So here I am. </span></span></p>
</div><div>
<p><b>What about you? ""What about me, you ask?""</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I am the mom of three wonderful children and
a wife of an extremely magnificent man. 
I am also blessed to be a daughter, a sister, a granddaughter, a niece, a
friend and bff, an author, a therapist and the list goes on.  I grew up in Compton, CA.  Earned my BA in Communications and Journalism and just completed my MBA at about a week ago.  I grew up in urban
area and like many from urban areas, we have urban issues.  Rather than put those issues on the back
burner,  it is time to bring them to the front door. Since knowledge is power, it's time to empower the next generation and what better way to do it than through children’s books and books by urban authors. We can take baby steps to teach
others.  I am now ready to start a
company to publish my books and other author's books especially for those who have difficulty getting their voices heard.  And guess what? You
can help. </span></p>
<p><b>What’s this campaign all about?</b> </p>
<p>This campaign is to fund the
start-up of <b>Rolling Wheels Publishing</b>.  A
company that will help authors <i>“Take their Imagination Further.”</i>  If you can dream it, why not achieve it. Your contributions will help us get more
books published and help us raise awareness about issues that impact urban areas and our society as a whole. We need to get people reading and start the reading earlier.  Children’s books are not only for children. They
are books that entertain as well as teach lessons to those who are reading to
children as well. The beautifully written and illustrated books we want to publish are just waiting to get off the pages taped to my walls and onto book store shelves.  </p>
<p>The first book published by Rolling Wheels Publishing is: <b>""LJ the Little Knight: The Battle of
Autism""</b> which is a book that is very close to my heart because it deals with
the subject matter of understanding autism spectrum disorders.  Our only son is autistic and we have to
communicate on a much different level, but seeing the world through his eyes
has helped me write this first book in the series.</p>

<b>Where did the name Rolling Wheels Publishing come from?</b>
</div><div>
<br/>
<p>The name <b>Rolling Wheels Publishing </b>came about when I thought

order, so I would have to turn down the music and I'd stick my head out the window or walk back up to the porch and say, “What was that Daddy. I couldn’t hear you.”  He would
smile and say “Your wheels are rolling.” Then he’s just crack up laughing
because of all of the extra effort I took to figure out what he was trying to
say. He got me every single time.</p>

<p></p></div>","Here's My Story and I'm Sticking To It
Who am I? 

My name is Kellie Knight and I write books.  In my search for finding a publishing company
to publish my first children’s book that I passionately worked on for years, I
ran into multiple road blocks. Suddenly, I had finally gotten to the point when it was time to
publish and I couldn't decide what the greater risk would be.  I stopped in my tracks and
thought, “I should publish this book myself.” So here I am. 

What about you? ""What about me, you ask?""
I am the mom of three wonderful children and
a wife of an extremely magnificent man. 
I am also blessed to be a daughter, a sister, a granddaughter, a niece, a
friend and bff, an author, a therapist and the list goes on.  I grew up in Compton, CA.  Earned my BA in Communications and Journalism and just completed my MBA at about a week ago.  I grew up in urban
area and like many from urban areas, we have urban issues.  Rather than put those issues on the back
burner,  it is time to bring them to the front door. Since knowledge is power, it's time to empower the next generation and what better way to do it than through children’s books and books by urban authors. We can take baby steps to teach
others.  I am now ready to start a
company to publish my books and other author's books especially for those who have difficulty getting their voices heard.  And guess what? You
can help. 
What’s this campaign all about? 
This campaign is to fund the
start-up of Rolling Wheels Publishing.  A
company that will help authors “Take their Imagination Further.”  If you can dream it, why not achieve it. Your contributions will help us get more
books published and help us raise awareness about issues that impact urban areas and our society as a whole. We need to get people reading and start the reading earlier.  Children’s books are not only for children. They
are books that entertain as well as teach lessons to those who are reading to
children as well. The beautifully written and illustrated books we want to publish are just waiting to get off the pages taped to my walls and onto book store shelves.  
The first book published by Rolling Wheels Publishing is: ""LJ the Little Knight: The Battle of
Autism"" which is a book that is very close to my heart because it deals with
the subject matter of understanding autism spectrum disorders.  Our only son is autistic and we have to
communicate on a much different level, but seeing the world through his eyes
has helped me write this first book in the series.


Where did the name Rolling Wheels Publishing come from?


The name Rolling Wheels Publishing came about when I thought
of my Daddy, Raymond Spencer, who is no longer on this earth, but was dearly loved and respected.  When I first learned how to drive and even years
later, I recall backing out of the drive way and my Daddy would yell something
from the porch. I could never decipher what he was yelling because he always had a special request when someone was leaving the house.  Sometimes it was a
request for candy bar, cigarettes or a beer from the store or a last minute KFC
order, so I would have to turn down the music and I'd stick my head out the window or walk back up to the porch and say, “What was that Daddy. I couldn’t hear you.”  He would
smile and say “Your wheels are rolling.” Then he’s just crack up laughing
because of all of the extra effort I took to figure out what he was trying to
say. He got me every single time.



   
What We Need We need to raise $8,000 to start this company.  
The funds raised for the start of Rolling Wheels Publishing
will be used for:
1. Printing and Shipping Costs
2. Company Registration Fees

Beginning in the late 1970s, he experienced a series of dramatic spiritual visions that eventually led him to abandon his career and become a teacher and guru in Hinduism’s Goddess-centered Sri Vidya tradition. Upon discovering the remains of an ancient Goddess shrine in the jungles of eastern India in 1983, he revived and expanded it, opening it to the public as Devipuram in 1994.</p><p>My name is Michael Bowden. I am an attorney, writer and publisher, and the compiler and editor of <i>Gifts from the Goddess: Selected Words of Sri Amritananda Natha Saraswati</i>. Working with Guruji, I authored his biography, <i>The Goddess and the Guru</i>, which published in 2017, supported by an extremely successful crowdfunding campaign. <i>Gifts from the Goddess</i> is a follow-up and companion volume--again, edited and compiled with Guruji’s direct input and involvement. The book presents a broad and generous selection of Guruji’s major, lesser-known, and never-before-seen works, together comprising a startlingly original and eye-opening primary sourcebook--laying out, in engaging, accessible prose, the deepest, most secret and closely guarded traditions of authentic Sri Vidya Hindu Tantra.</p><h2>Where This Book Came From</h2><p>One day in the mid-oughts, Guruji, knowing of my background in editorial and publications work, showed me an astonishing manuscript called <i>Understanding Sri Chakra Puja</i>. He had composed it more than a decade earlier, but it was never quite finished, he said. Guruji asked me to help him complete it.</p><p>The draft, he explained, had been written in 1993-94, with an American woman named Devi Parvati acting as both interviewer and scribe. They worked on the book together until early 1994, at which point Guruji became enmeshed in the minutiae of running the newly opened Devipuram, and Devi Parvati had to return to America. In those pre-Internet, pre-cellphone days, the two soon fell out of touch--and <i>Understanding Sri Chakra Puja</i> was left unfinished.</p><p>In the late 1990s, a massive computer crash at Devipuram caused Guruji to lose many of his early writings and other precious documents. Among the casualties was the original manuscript of <i>Understanding Sri Chakra Puja</i>. He eventually found a copy in PDF format and asked a young devotee to convert it back into MS Word. The young man did so, but in the process, many sentences, paragraphs and sections of the document--including many mantras--were either dropped entirely or scrambled out of sequence.</p><p>Guruji noticed the problem immediately, but had no time to fix it himself and could find no one else to do the job. Eventually copies of the draft leaked and began circulating among Guruji’s followers in various forms.</p><p>But Guruji still wanted to get it right. And that, he told me, is where I could be of assistance.</p><h3>Reconstruction and Expansion</h3><p style=""clear: both;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537893129/h7frekjfhgbu9ok4cjx8.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;padding:10px;""/>Over the next few years, Guruji and I worked slowly through <i>Understanding Sri Chakra Puja</i>, gradually restoring its original form. Along the way, I also began assisting him with editing and preserving some of his other writings and lectures. The more I read of his work, the more I felt it deserved a wider audience. I eventually suggested that a selection of his writings should be compiled with <i>Understanding Sri Chakra Puja</i> into a comprehensive selection in book form.</p><p>And the seed of the present volume was born.</p><p><i>Gifts from the Goddess</i> includes writings and lectures from Guruji’s earliest (and arguably, most intense and vivid) days of spiritual teaching, while he was still a working nuclear scientist, and continues on to later gems written not long before his death. Among the many rarities in this volume are his powerful writings on the Ten Mahavidyas (“Great Wisdom Goddesses”) of Tantric tradition, a collection also known as the “Lusaka Notes”--works that even lifelong devotees have difficulty sourcing. Here, for the first time, they are presented in their entirety, augmented with later updates and additions by Guruji.</p><h3>The Quality of Guruji’s Work</h3><p style=""clear: both;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537896162/gokmkwuxc8kliluvyjl6.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;padding:10px;""/>Guruji lived very much in the present moment. Once a lecture was delivered, an essay written, a ritual perfected, he did not linger for long in its glow, but immediately moved on to new challenges.</p><p>His manner of expressing himself was genuine and original. He was an evocative writer and a natural teacher with a compassionate, compelling and practical message that, I am confident, will genuinely benefit many people on many different spiritual paths. Over time, I came to view him as a quiet but profound game-changer, a true iconoclast, a living exemplar of the ancient archetype of the <i>jivanmukta</i>—the enlightened being living in the world. (In fairness, this is a claim he has never made, to my knowledge. Quite the contrary: “I don’t accept any claims of me being a realized soul,” he once said. “To me, material and spiritual are all the same. There is only one realized soul. That is God. And you are it.”)</p><p>For Guruji, it was always about his students, always about teaching and sharing understanding. That ethic and dedication to radical honesty, transparency and accessibility for all exudes from this collection.</p><h3>Going It Alone</h3><p style=""clear: both;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537895360/vt9yh5xhxsik9dob0ufw.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;padding:10px;""/>When, with Guruji’s help and guidance, I initially completed the drafts to his biography, <i>The Goddess and the Guru</i>, and his collected works, <i>Gifts from the Goddess</i>, I presented formal proposals and sample chapters from both to a wide range of commercial publishers.</p><p>The biographical portion, <i>The Goddess and the Guru</i>, received some compliments for its artistic and literary merit and presentation, but no commercial publisher saw any serious potential in it: “Who would buy it?” they asked. “This Guruji just isn’t well-known enough.” The <i>Gifts from the Goddess</i> part, however--that is, the writings--got a lot of nibbles. Two major “Eastern spirituality” publishers, in particular, were interested in publishing Guruji’s writings without the biography. One mainly wanted just the sexiest, most provocative “Tantric” stuff. The second publisher was kinder and more evenhanded, but still wanted to stick with affirmations and inspirational writings. The rest, the reviewing editor told me, would have to be “dumbed down, frankly”: it was simply “too authentic” to be palatable to a mass audience.</p><p>The bottom line? To publish Guruji's writings commercially, we would have to give up on his intended and clearly stated vision--not to mention a huge amount of control over content, presentation, quality, etc. With the approach we are taking now, Guruji’s work remains in the control of Devipuram and Guruji’s followers.</p><p>And that is the reason for this campaign. We need to pull together and make this happen in a form that Guruji would recognize and approve. Yes, it’s a <i>lot</i> more work, and involves a <i>lot</i> more financial risk--but if we succeed, we’ll end up with the book that Guruji envisioned, the unadulterated teachings he wanted to share with the world, and an enduring legacy work to pass down for generations to come.</p><p style=""clear: both;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537896869/uivgegm3lmrllu5eahrg.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;padding:10px;""/>So it’s all up to us: Guruji’s friends, admirers, supporters, fans and disciples.

Please be sure to read our latest campaign update with important information about shipping dates. The books have been delayed for a number of unforeseen reasons, and we expect to ship them in late 2019. All other perks are shipping THIS WEEK!Explore the Essential Teachings of Sri Amritananda Natha SaraswatiSri Amritananda Natha Saraswati (1934-2015), widely known as “Guruji,” was a top nuclear scientist managing missile defense projects in India. Beginning in the late 1970s, he experienced a series of dramatic spiritual visions that eventually led him to abandon his career and become a teacher and guru in Hinduism’s Goddess-centered Sri Vidya tradition. Upon discovering the remains of an ancient Goddess shrine in the jungles of eastern India in 1983, he revived and expanded it, opening it to the public as Devipuram in 1994.My name is Michael Bowden. I am an attorney, writer and publisher, and the compiler and editor of Gifts from the Goddess: Selected Words of Sri Amritananda Natha Saraswati. Working with Guruji, I authored his biography, The Goddess and the Guru, which published in 2017, supported by an extremely successful crowdfunding campaign. Gifts from the Goddess is a follow-up and companion volume--again, edited and compiled with Guruji’s direct input and involvement. The book presents a broad and generous selection of Guruji’s major, lesser-known, and never-before-seen works, together comprising a startlingly original and eye-opening primary sourcebook--laying out, in engaging, accessible prose, the deepest, most secret and closely guarded traditions of authentic Sri Vidya Hindu Tantra.Where This Book Came FromOne day in the mid-oughts, Guruji, knowing of my background in editorial and publications work, showed me an astonishing manuscript called Understanding Sri Chakra Puja. He had composed it more than a decade earlier, but it was never quite finished, he said. Guruji asked me to help him complete it.The draft, he explained, had been written in 1993-94, with an American woman named Devi Parvati acting as both interviewer and scribe. They worked on the book together until early 1994, at which point Guruji became enmeshed in the minutiae of running the newly opened Devipuram, and Devi Parvati had to return to America. In those pre-Internet, pre-cellphone days, the two soon fell out of touch--and Understanding Sri Chakra Puja was left unfinished.In the late 1990s, a massive computer crash at Devipuram caused Guruji to lose many of his early writings and other precious documents. Among the casualties was the original manuscript of Understanding Sri Chakra Puja. He eventually found a copy in PDF format and asked a young devotee to convert it back into MS Word. The young man did so, but in the process, many sentences, paragraphs and sections of the document--including many mantras--were either dropped entirely or scrambled out of sequence.Guruji noticed the problem immediately, but had no time to fix it himself and could find no one else to do the job. Eventually copies of the draft leaked and began circulating among Guruji’s followers in various forms.But Guruji still wanted to get it right. And that, he told me, is where I could be of assistance.Reconstruction and ExpansionOver the next few years, Guruji and I worked slowly through Understanding Sri Chakra Puja, gradually restoring its original form. Along the way, I also began assisting him with editing and preserving some of his other writings and lectures. The more I read of his work, the more I felt it deserved a wider audience. I eventually suggested that a selection of his writings should be compiled with Understanding Sri Chakra Puja into a comprehensive selection in book form.And the seed of the present volume was born.Gifts from the Goddess includes writings and lectures from Guruji’s earliest (and arguably, most intense and vivid) days of spiritual teaching, while he was still a working nuclear scientist, and continues on to later gems written not long before his death. Among the many rarities in this volume are his powerful writings on the Ten Mahavidyas (“Great Wisdom Goddesses”) of Tantric tradition, a collection also known as the “Lusaka Notes”--works that even lifelong devotees have difficulty sourcing. Here, for the first time, they are presented in their entirety, augmented with later updates and additions by Guruji.The Quality of Guruji’s WorkGuruji lived very much in the present moment. Once a lecture was delivered, an essay written, a ritual perfected, he did not linger for long in its glow, but immediately moved on to new challenges.His manner of expressing himself was genuine and original. He was an evocative writer and a natural teacher with a compassionate, compelling and practical message that, I am confident, will genuinely benefit many people on many different spiritual paths. Over time, I came to view him as a quiet but profound game-changer, a true iconoclast, a living exemplar of the ancient archetype of the jivanmukta—the enlightened being living in the world. (In fairness, this is a claim he has never made, to my knowledge. Quite the contrary: “I don’t accept any claims of me being a realized soul,” he once said. “To me, material and spiritual are all the same. There is only one realized soul. That is God. And you are it.”)For Guruji, it was always about his students, always about teaching and sharing understanding. That ethic and dedication to radical honesty, transparency and accessibility for all exudes from this collection.Going It AloneWhen, with Guruji’s help and guidance, I initially completed the drafts to his biography, The Goddess and the Guru, and his collected works, Gifts from the Goddess, I presented formal proposals and sample chapters from both to a wide range of commercial publishers.The biographical portion, The Goddess and the Guru, received some compliments for its artistic and literary merit and presentation, but no commercial publisher saw any serious potential in it: “Who would buy it?” they asked. “This Guruji just isn’t well-known enough.” The Gifts from the Goddess part, however--that is, the writings--got a lot of nibbles. Two major “Eastern spirituality” publishers, in particular, were interested in publishing Guruji’s writings without the biography. One mainly wanted just the sexiest, most provocative “Tantric” stuff. The second publisher was kinder and more evenhanded, but still wanted to stick with affirmations and inspirational writings. The rest, the reviewing editor told me, would have to be “dumbed down, frankly”: it was simply “too authentic” to be palatable to a mass audience.The bottom line? To publish Guruji's writings commercially, we would have to give up on his intended and clearly stated vision--not to mention a huge amount of control over content, presentation, quality, etc. With the approach we are taking now, Guruji’s work remains in the control of Devipuram and Guruji’s followers.And that is the reason for this campaign. We need to pull together and make this happen in a form that Guruji would recognize and approve. Yes, it’s a lot more work, and involves a lot more financial risk--but if we succeed, we’ll end up with the book that Guruji envisioned, the unadulterated teachings he wanted to share with the world, and an enduring legacy work to pass down for generations to come.So it’s all up to us: Guruji’s friends, admirers, supporters, fans and disciples. If we don’t make this happen, no one else will.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i><strong>23 Miles and Running</strong></i>—The amazing, inspirational, and uplifting story of a young boy who grew up chopping cotton in the Mississippi Delta and ended up sleeping in the White House.<br/><br/>My name is Ty Pinkins, and I am the author of <strong><i>23 Miles and Running</i></strong>. I wrote this book to share the amazing account of a kid’s inspirational journey around the world. I was born in the small town of Rolling Fork, Mississippi, literally yards from a cotton field. After giving birth at 15, mom quit school to take care of me while dad worked as a tractor driver on a cotton farm. I grew up on cotton farms.<br/><br/>We moved from plantation to plantation, depending on where dad found work. When I was around 13 years old, he shook me awake early one morning before the sun rose. I climbed on to the back of an old beat-up truck with men twice my age. After driving several miles, the old truck stopped. We all climbed off and stood in the middle of a long dirt road. As the sun began to peek over the horizon, we stared silently at the seemingly never-ending rows and rows of freshly grown cotton—still moist with the morning dew.<br/><br/>Chopping cotton was grueling—back-breaking work. I did it throughout my teenage years to help my parents take care of me. Even at such a young age, I knew it was difficult for my parents—I wanted to carry my own weight. There were times when those cotton fields nearly broke me down. However, over time, I realized how that experience actually built me up! It prepared me for the incredible journey ahead.<br/><br/>In this book, I share that journey—with a deep sense of humility and realization that I am not an anomaly. Just as there were many others like me walking those rows of cotton back then, still today, there are many children in the Mississippi Delta growing up in poverty.<br/><br/>I hope that this book will be an inspiration to you and anyone else struggling to overcome adversity and help you discover that light within yourself to help you get back up when you’ve been knocked down. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for overcoming obstacles. I want you to see this book as a tool to help you take that next step forward when you feel like you’re too tired to keep going; and ultimately, face your next challenge with an anxious smile, knowing that through positive energy, you’ve already won.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about overcoming adversity and living life to its fullest—like dancing as if no one is watching:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growing up in the Mississippi Delta</li>
<li>Sailing Across the East China Sea</li>
<li>Flying Aboard Air Force One</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you enjoy a true story of overcoming adversity when life has dealt you a shitty hand, and the cards are stacked against you.<br/><br/>23 Miles and Running is a non-fiction book that speaks to the underdog and people in society who are facing seemingly insurmountable odds.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book - 23 Miles and Running</h3>
<p>The book is written in three parts:<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction and Chapters 1-8. Born in the belly of poverty and chopping cotton in the Mississippi Delta to help my parents pay the bills, I’ll discuss the time when I was 12-years-old and assembled an old bike; and without a seat, I road door-to-door asking people for my first job. I’ll also discuss my first time climbing onto the back of an old truck with men twice my age to head to the cotton fields. Additionally, I will discuss how a lanky white guy from Indiana, traveled over 650 miles to small-town Rolling Fork, Mississippi to lead a team of kids to the state high school basketball championship, and how that moment built so much hope and positive energy in those kids.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 9-11. This part discusses my transition from Mississippi when I joined the Army and was shipped off to Bootcamp. It will discuss the 13 years I spent in Europe as well as the challenges I faced and the friendships I made during three combat tours. In this chapter, I will share my experiences of letting go of my fears and traveling across Europe without a care in the world—ending up intentionally lost in places like London, Austria, and Germany.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 12-16. This part takes us to Okinawa, Japan, and on a voyage across the East China sea. It follows my amazing journey from that tiny island to the White House and beyond. In this section, I’ll share with you the importance of never giving up and that no dream is too big—reach beyond the stars. I will share how a chance encounter led to me working for the President of the United States, sleeping in the White House and flying on Air Force One.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Overcomer is about how successful entrepreneurs use fear as a catalyst for success in all areas of life. Unfortunately, most of us don’t have the luxury of having our opportunities handed to us on a silver platter at day one. In fact, the most successful entrepreneurs start with nothing. What makes them different from the rest? They achieve their ultimate success with a proven formula: determination, hard work, and a passionate vision.My name is DeDee Cai, and I am the author of The Overcomer. I want to inspire my fellow entrepreneurs, no matter where you are in your journey, to own your voice. You can pursue your purpose and create a massive impact on the world while flourishing as your authentic, imperfect self.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that you are more powerful than you ever imagined. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for overcoming fears and challenges. Ultimately, I want you to see The Overcomer as a tool to help you realize your true unique potential.In this book, you'll learn…

The cheat codes to unlearn your fear as quickly as you learned it.
How some of the most successful entrepreneurs became successful by embracing their fears, and how you can too.
How one woman broke a cycle of five generations of domestic violence just by re-writing her story.
How another woman transformed her life by curing her own depression, anxiety, and fear.

 
If you love self-development, entrepreneurship, and care about leaving a legacy of positive impact, this is a book you will cherish for life.The Overcomer is a nonfiction book that speaks to business owners, and self-development junkies who want to look at fear and success in a new way.
 
The Book - The Overcomer

This book is split into three value-packed parts that will guide you on your journey to finding your authentic self.Part 1: The first three chapters and introduction will teach you about the history of fear, what sets the overcomer apart, and why NOW is the ideal time to have a conversation around how we can embrace fear for our own success.Part 2: In chapters four through nine, you’ll get an in-depth view of the overcomer’s characteristics, and the principles they live by. You’ll witness stories of growth and transformation showing exactly how the overcomer takes on challenges in life and business.Part 3: In chapters ten through thirteen, you’ll explore the journey of an overcomer, and be challenged to follow along in your own life. You’ll see how anyone can overcome any adversity while rewriting their destiny.

Neil Gaiman</span></h6>
<h3>My ""Dark"" Story</h3>
<p>It was late summer, Paris, 2008. I had just finished five Stephen King novels and the Twilight Series and Neil Gaiman's American Gods. I was a professional blogger, writing art marketing tips for artists. But in the mornings, a story was blooming in me. A dark man in the woods of Western New York. The Wild Hunt roaming the skies. And a creature - half-woman, half-bird, that came to me out of a real ghost story from the region of a half-woman, half-horse ghost that sometimes appears on a hill in the Finger Lakes. And the mortals who have unknowingly called them there, searching for something WILD in themselves. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I started writing my story and simultaneously researching the creatures that were appearing in my head. Many of them related eerily back to the Gods and Fairies of ancient Ireland and I realized that I was somehow tapping into the collection consciousness. It thrilled me.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For the next two months I wrote every day until a first draft was completed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Since then I have done a lot of research on the heroes and Gods of Ancient Ireland, the flora and fauna of Upstate New York, and even spent a week in September 2010 in the Naples valley where it takes place. Two months ago I moved back to the area permanently, partly to really get my hooks into the setting of this story. But it still needs a lot of rewriting and some professional guidance. As a professional editor, I can look at it and honestly say that what it needs is the space and time a writing residency would afford me.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So I applied and sample I submitted was good enough to get me into the Vermont Studio Center, a prestigious writing residency in Johnson Vermont, for May 2011. This would allow me a month to focus solely on my creative writing instead of my freelance nonfiction writing and my editing work. It would allow me to be among other writers - I have been very isolated from people for the past 3 years because of the financial struggles of having my own business in this economic climate.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>GO TO THE GALLERY TO READ A RECENT DRAFT OF PART OF THE NOVEL.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am a published poet and short fiction writer but I really feel that my best work will be my completed novel. It will combine paranormal romance with philosophical explorations of what it means to desire to ""lose oneself."" I like to think of it as a cross between Neil Gaiman and Milan Kundera. I value readability and entertainment and will focus my efforts on making the story unforgettable.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have been writing and publishing my work since I was 15. I have studied with some incredible writers and once upon a time thought I would be one of them. But working as an editor every day has really made it hard to be the creative person I need to be in my off-time.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I think I have what it takes to make a really beautiful, lush novel that will thrill and intrigue readers. I just need some time, community support, and financial support to do it. And the added confidence that this will bring.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The problem I am facing is that even after being awarded grant money, 
the cost for the month at the Vermont Studio Center is still $1,950. I 
need to come up with at least $950.00 by April 8. The rest can be paid 
in monthly installments.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is what I can offer you in terms of perks: a copy of the book when it is published, thank yous in the dedication of the book, brief tutorials in how to submit your own work for publication (this is one of my professional services), or having a character named after you (for really big donations). </p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ABOUT THE SERIES<br/></span></strong></p>
<p>I’m raising money to launch a comprehensive publicity campaign to promote, distribute, and otherwise introduce Leoros to the world. THE EMERALD TABLET is <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">book 1 of 7</span></strong> in the <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">LEGENDS OF AMUN RA</span></strong> series.</p>
<p><strong>THE EMERALD TABLET</strong> is published by Enchanted Forest Press. Because we’re still in the editing phase, we’re not exactly sure how many pages it will end up being, because it depends on layout. However, we anticipate the book will be between 400 – 450 pages long.</p>
<p>I wrote <strong>THE EMERALD TABLET</strong> because I wanted to write the type of books I loved when I was a kid. I loved the Star Trek and Star Wars Universes; I loved murder mysteries and thrillers (and I still do), I also loved the comic book series Thor, which dealt with Norse mythology.

I’m raising money to launch a comprehensive publicity campaign to promote, distribute, and otherwise introduce Leoros to the world. THE EMERALD TABLET is book 1 of 7 in the LEGENDS OF AMUN RA series.
THE EMERALD TABLET is published by Enchanted Forest Press. Because we’re still in the editing phase, we’re not exactly sure how many pages it will end up being, because it depends on layout. However, we anticipate the book will be between 400 – 450 pages long.
I wrote THE EMERALD TABLET because I wanted to write the type of books I loved when I was a kid. I loved the Star Trek and Star Wars Universes; I loved murder mysteries and thrillers (and I still do), I also loved the comic book series Thor, which dealt with Norse mythology. My father introduced me to ancient Egypt and Greece and I fell in love with their mythologies as well. I wanted to combine everything I loved into one heart pounding series.
But most of all, I wanted to explore the human psyche a little. What makes a person good? What makes a person bad? As a fan of science fiction, I loved Darth Vader, but I also wanted to know what led him down the path of the dark side and what made Luke Skywalker strong enough not to succumb to the dark side’s temptations?
I wanted my characters to have to face their fears, overcome their weaknesses, and HAVE to step up to win. I also wanted to write a book that appealed to young adults to get them into writing just as much as a grown adult. Remember, YA is a point of view, not a reading level. I often re-read the stories I read when I was younger.
I have big plans for little Leoros and his gang.  I’m hoping a launch of book 2 in around summer, 2013.
Throughout the seven books, Leoros and Atlantia will go from 13 year olds just learning the world, into young adulthood, and emerging as a grown men and women the climactic battle of book 7.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

<h3><strong>RUN AMOK BOOKS: OUR STORY</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.runamokbooks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Run Amok Books</a> is a small independent press located in Princeton, New Jersey. We published our first book in the fall of 2016. Since then, we have published 6 books, with 4 more slated for 2018 and 3 more already contracted for 2019. In a word, we are growing! And that is great news!</p>
<p>As we grow, so does our reputation. Each month, we find an increasing number of worthy submissions in our submissions in-box. True to our mandate, we strive to publish books that deserve to be published and that are routinely overlooked by the mainstream book industry.</p>
<h3>
<i>THE ABUNDANT LIFE</i> BY AARON JACOBS</h3>
<p>It is difficult to express the excitement we felt at Run Amok when Aaron's submission popped up in our in-box. Here was a book that clearly fit our mandate: it was extremely well written, topically relevant, and funny--oh so funny! We were not surprised to learn that <i>The Abundant Life</i> had already gone the traditional publishing route. It had been sent by an eager New York agent to a well-known New York publishing house and had found its way onto an editor's desk. Impressed and excited, the editor pitched the book to the publisher, who after reviewing it did not hear that magical cha-ching of cash registers opening and so passed--said ""no"" to an excellent manuscript and talented author. But their loss was our gain, and we jumped at the chance to publish it.</p>
<h3>OUR CHALLENGE</h3>
<p>The challenge for us is that while our publication list has expanded with great books like Aaron's, our budget has not. This has left us to find new and innovative ways to find funding, ways like crowdfunding and Indiegogo. So what do we need more funds for? The truth is, making books these days can be done quite inexpensively. This is particularly true for Run Amok Books, as all the editing, formatting, and design is done in-house by dedicated Run Amok staff, who volunteer countless hours to projects they passionately believe in. What cannot be done by us is real advertising and promotion. Oh, we can and do send out countless emails to newspaper and magazine reviewers, and to bloggers and book lovers. But in the end, placing a print ad in <a href=""https://www.publishersweekly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Publishers Weekly</a> or a digital ad online at <a href=""http://therumpus.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Rumpus</a> or <a href=""https://www.forewordreviews.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Foreword Reviews</a> costs money. Having our books listed at <a href=""https://www.netgalley.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Net Galley</a> costs a lot of money, but it's money well spent, as a listing on Net Galley virtually guarantees that a book will be reviewed/discussed/buzzed by book bloggers, an essential part of the promotional equation. Just to give you a sense of the costs involved, below is a list  of the costs involved in the book promotion campaign we have planned for <i>The Abundant Life</i>.</p>
<ul>
<li>print ad in Foreword Reviews (to coincide with the publication date): $475 - $1000</li>
<li>digital ad in literary e-zines (such as The Rumpus) fulfilled by Litbreaker: $300 - $450</li>
<li>Listing on Net Galley book review site: $450 - $700.</li>
<li>Social media campaign (twitter, facebook): $100 - $150</li>
<li>Total = $1,325 - 2,300</li>
</ul>
<h3>HOW YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise about 70% of the promotional costs (about $1250) for <i>The Abundant Life </i>through crowdfunding. In order to give books like Aaron's the exposure they deserve, we are asking for public support, for your help. Keep in mind that there are many deserving books, like Aaron's, out there, written by many talented people--it could be a friend, a family member, the girl that sits beside you in Lit Theory 101, or the guy clicking away on his laptop in your local coffee shop--and we'd like to publish and promote as many of these books as possible. In order to do that, we're going to need additional funding. And that is where you come in. Please consider supporting this promotional campaign, and when you do, choose a perk--our way of saying ""Thank You"" for your support.</p>

Womanthology is entirely made up of first person content where incredible women (and supportive male champions of diversity) share their career stories, wisdom and knowledge about accelerating gender balance at work.
Our stories encourage our readers to reflect on their own career plans, hopes and ambitions.
Unlike regular women’s magazines, Womanthology is not about how you look, or how old you are. Traditional magazine segmentation keeps women of different ages apart. We want to bring them together.
Our stories have reached more than 200,000 readers and our social media shares have been seen more than 12.5 million times. We’ve come so far but there’s so much more to do and we need your pledges to keep growing.

<h3>Our project</h3>
<p>My name is Claire and I have worked for 12 years with hospital clowns and I really want people to understand how precious their contributions are to the wellbeing of sick children.</p>
<p>When my friend Regula Stucki wrote her book, I was on my way to London to study publishing. </p>
<p>Perfect timing! </p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
</div><div>
<p>First we need to translate the book in English. We have found the translator. Now we need the funds.</p>
<p>When the manuscript is done and checked, I will work with a self-publisher to create the physical book. Here again, we will need funds. </p>
<p>We are going to do two campaigns:</p>
<p>- one, the one you are looking at, for the translations costs - £ 2,000</p>
<p>- one, in the Spring, for the production costs - £ 2,500</p>
</div><div>
<p>The book exists in German and has sold nicely there. But I believe it has a much greater potential in English. There are thousands of hospital clowns all over the world and very few books on this particular job.</p>
<p>I am sure that parents, carers, hospital staff would be happy to know more about those precious moments.</p>
<p> I believe in this project so much, that I am ready to put time, energy and funds into it. But I thought it would mean so much more if many, many people could participate. ""Together"" is such a beautiful word.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>My name is Madison Troutz, and I am the author of iExperience: The Future of Museums. I wrote this book because I believe there is a need for certain topics to be addressed within the industry such as inclusivity, the rise of technology, and the revitalization of the museum industry.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that there is a need for a revitalization of the museum industry. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for experiential engagement and immersive exhibitions in you. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a guide to start having conversations about how museums can better cater to you, the visitors. Moreover, I hope this book serves as a guide toward the future and the important steps that need to be taken.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how in order to look toward the future, first, we must look toward our past:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Child Within - In this chapter, I go through how maybe the experiences we had in our childhood might be the key to revitalizing the museum industry.</li>
<li>Building Immersion - This chapter talks about how to build an immersive exhibition, what an immersive exhibition looks like, and how it can be incorporated into a museum setting.</li>
<li>The Redesign - This chapter goes in-depth, through what we need to do in order to revitalize the industry.</li>
</ul>You will love this book if you love activism, technology, museums, or even a captivating read.<br/>iExperience is a non-fiction book that speaks to museum-goers and museum professionals who are looking at the future of the industry, are curious, and open to the possibilities of what lies next.<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - iExperience</h2>
<p>The book is written in 4 Parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the Introduction + Chapters 1, 2, and 3. This chapter goes through the history of museums and how they became what they are today. You’ll learn about how museums were/are evolutionary in structure both physically and in ambiance. You’ll also learn about how experiential learning is the key to success and how pioneers like Walt Disney might have been an innovator in more industries than just one.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Part 2 is an other-worldly part, as the reader is fully immersed in technology. You’ll see how technologies like virtual reality can be used not only as a new way to experience museums but also as a way for everyone to experience museums. Then, you’ll be immersed in Let’s Hopscotch: Light &amp; Sound; a pop-up art exhibition that focuses on immersive, interactive experiences in order to bring people together and restore a once-lost connection.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 7 and 8. This section focuses on expanding the demographics of museum-goers. Currently, the demographics of museum-goers revolves around women, ages 45-56— we need to change this. The question is: how? Through my own ethnographic and analytical research, you’ll learn that the key to getting more people to enjoy museums, or expanding the demographic, is through opening the doors to a new way of experiencing museums.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains chapters 9, 10, and the conclusion. The last part of my book focuses on exactly how we’re going to revitalize the museum industry. In March of 2019, I went to Austin’s SXSW— a city-wide festival, of sorts, about technology and innovation. Through my experience at the Trump’s Twitter Library exhibition, put on by The Daily Show, I saw exactly what needed to be done in order for this revitalization plan to work. Moreover, I focus-in on what the meaning of a museum truly is and how if that meaning is kept front and center, there’s no way a museum could fail.</p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Madison Troutz is a University of Texas at Austin alum as well as a museum professional in Texas.<br/><br/>I wrote this book because I am passionate about museums. Through my formal education at UT, as a Sociocultural Anthropology major, it is in my nature to question environments and how they impact their inhabitants. As such, it only made sense to question the museum industry and take a visitor-centric approach when thinking about what they need in order to be future-proof.<br/><br/>If you were to ask my dog about me, he would probably say that his mom loves to go to local eateries and hit up local art events in the Austin area. However, I think that he’ll attest to, more than anything, my love for animals. As such, as an avid thrifter, I tend to only shop at thrift shops that give proceeds to local animal shelters. <br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Madison at madietroutz@gmail. LinkedIn <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/feed/</a>, Instagram @madhaitro, and on her Website <a href=""https://troutzhome.wixsite.com/website"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://troutzhome.wixsite.com/website</a>.</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use.

thINKingDANCE launched in October 2011, co-founded by Lisa Kraus and Anna Drozdowski because Philly’s burgeoning dance scene needed more coverage—intelligent, respectful writing—especially with the decline in print journalism. With 21 writers out of the starting gate and now 8 more, we have published over 260 articles about the work of over 150 artists/companies/venues. Our first year’s workshops, website design, and writer and editor fees were supported by a Dance Advance grant. Since January, we’ve been donating our time. To create a sustainable future, we need to pay our people! We are raising $8000 through Indiegogo and we look to you and everyone who reads and benefits from TD to partner with us by contributing your support.
 
More reasons to give and perks for every level of donation are listed below.  
 
Thank you for reading and supporting thINKingDANCE!

Brooks, Lynnette Overby, Megan Bridge, Nathaniel B. Hancock, Patricia Graham, Peter Price, R. Eric Thomas, Whitney Weinstein
What We Need 
Here’s where the money will go:


Workshops with guest teachers to develop skills in seeing, writing and critiquing  $1500


Web upgrades $500


Writers and editors fees  $4500


Fees for our editorial board, coordination of workshops and assignments, and social media, communications and grant-writing   $1500  

 
We'll thank you with gifts for various levels of giving that include public thanks on our site and on Facebook,  the unique TD lapel pin, the chance to curate your own Public Square discussion, a “Dance Date” attending a show with a TD writer, sitting in on our workshops, and more.
At TD, we imagined a future for dance writing. It looked something like this: 
 
What if dance writing had a space that was more than 3 column inches? 
 
What if writers came together to talk about their craft, the field and the work they saw?
 
What if choreographers could rely on getting coverage for their work that digs deeper, that doesn’t just describe? 
 
What if our city’s thriving, growing dance scene was made more visible, both in and outside of Philadelphia?
 
Over the last year and a half, thINKingDANCE has been working on creating that future. We’ve had a slow, quiet, but volcanic impact. 
 
What People Are Saying: 
 


Terry Fox, Executive Director, Philadelphia Dance Projects: 

“Anyone who writes about dance revs up the excitement for it and the discussion around it, or so that has been the result of thINKingDANCE  among dancers and presenters here in the Philly area the past 2 years. Preview articles have served to promote events and attract audience by linking to Facebook, websites and e-news.  Overall the journal has tangibly demonstrated the large volume of dance activity going in the region and has provided a history for same, which in and of itself is a valuable service to a somewhat marginalized art form. TD has trained and given voice to many people wanting to pursue esthetic and critical writing.”
 


Nicole Bindler, Choreographer

“TD broadens the accessibility of dance for the layperson, exposing audiences to the underlying concepts and ideas that dance artists are working with. TD supports dance artists in Philadelphia by providing a mirror to reflect on their work, a new lens through which to see their process and by giving them a vital presence online... When I was in residence in Mexico City a musician noticed I was reading Susan Rethorst's book and then said: ""Ahh, I've heard about this..."" and then showed me a tab on his web browser with Megan Bridge's TD review of the book.How did a musician in Mexico find his way there? How many others around the world are reading about dance through TD and expanding their definition and impression of what dance is?""
 


Nathea Lee, Managing Director, Kùlú Mèlé African Dance & Drum Ensemble 

“As a managing director and member of Philadelphia's rich dance community, I appreciate thINKingDANCE for its thoughtful and well informed coverage of the full spectrum of dance. It is especially meaningful at this time when media coverage of arts and culture has diminished to such an extent. There are not many writers who are knowledgeable about traditional/folkloric dance, so it has been refreshing to read reviews of Kulu Mele's work that are written from an informed perspective.”
 


Marissa Montenegro, Public Relations Manager, Pennsylvania Ballet   

   “Since its inception, thINKingDANCE has offered an invaluable platform for both the city’s talented dance writers as well as its vibrant and diverse dance organizations and artists. Its writers have crafted countless thoughtful, creative, and meaningful pieces. Their contribution to the discourse on dance in Philadelphia cannot be overstated.”

Pourquoi ce livre?



Il existe peu d'ouvrages qui expliquent les liens entre l'histoire, la colonisation, la sociologie et l'architecture en Afrique. L'importance de ce livre réside dans le fait qu'il couvre les conséquences des changements structuraux de la société en Afrique Centrale sur le logement, tout en décrivant les techniques traditionnelles, le tout abondamment illustré, avec des photos et des dessins.

Cet ouvrage est une tentative de réponse au dilemme constant que rencontre l'architecte africain, dans sa pratique du métier, à savoir la conception des architectures ""africaines modernes"" alors que les africains ne veulent plus vivre dans des cases ou des huttes de paille.
La démarche que propose Epée Ellong, avec Diane Chehab, est de parcourir ce qui constitue l'architecture africaine traditionnelle jusqu'à l'architecture africaine moderne, afin de faire apparaître les contradictions dans les mutations sociales et techniques au cours des différentes étapes historiques qui constituent cette époque. 
Pour accomplir ce travail, l'auteur puise dans son expérience et sa connaissance propre de l'Afrique Centrale. Il a voyagé considérablement à l'intérieur du Cameroun, et a discuté avec les habitants, y inclus les chefs traditionnels et les anciens des villages.
Les illustrations et photos qui accompagnent les textes montrent les phases de construction des architectures traditionnelles, modernes, les objets usuels, etc... De nombreuses références historiques et linguistiques vernaculaires sont utilisées pour mieux expliquer et faire comprendre les changements sur le plan humain et architectural.
Parmi les sujets couverts dans l’ouvrage:
- Les migrations historiques en Afrique
- L’architecture traditionnelle au Cameroun
- L’architecture coloniale
- Les conséquences des changements sociaux sur l’architecture et l’espace bâti
- L’évolution de l’habitat au Cameroun
- Orientations pour une architecture

<p>This project helps fight childhood cancer, supports independent artists, and entertains you. And it's ridiculously simple.</p>
<p>I'm Rick Wayne, and I'm a<strong> socially responsible author</strong>.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean I write about the environment or social justice. It means I want to <strong>make the act of reading a <em>social</em> good</strong> (not just a personal one).</p>
<p>I want you to help the world even when you're enjoying amazing stories about wizards or counter-terrorists or renegade lovers or explosions in space.</p>
<p>I mean, why can't we <strong>enjoy ourselves and be socially conscious at the same time</strong>?</p>
<p>I think we can.</p>
<p>But I can't do it alone.</p>
<p>I'm organizing an anthology of eclectic short fiction for release later this year. The authors will all be<strong> talented independents writing cutting-edge stories</strong> on all kinds of crazy ideas (not just socially conscious ones).</p>
<h3>Here's where you come in.</h3>
<p>The business end of a book, much like the business end of a horse, is an active and smelly thing. It takes a lot of feed to write, edit, cover design, format, and produce an <strong>awesome book</strong>.</p>
<p>And we're going for awesome here.</p>

<h2><span class=""articleTitle"">Why support St. Jude?</span></h2>
<p>From the website...</p>
<p>The support of caring people like you helps ensure that St. Jude Children's Research Hospital will continue its lifesaving mission of finding cures and saving children.</p>
<p><strong>How do your donations help?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks to donors, no family ever pays St. Jude for anything. Care, housing, transportation, meals—the list of services we provide to our families is unequalled. But it is for one purpose: To ensure the very best outcome possible for every child.</li>
</ul><p><strong>How is St. Jude making a difference for sick children?</strong></p>

</ul><p><strong>How are donations used?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During the past five years, 81 cents of every dollar received has supported the research and treatment at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.</li>

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>These days I spend most of my time writing fictional oddities, but in previous lives I've been a medical student, a survey researcher, a corporate executive, and a husband.</p>
<p>I have two big dogs that go with me everywhere. I'm a cheese freak, a music junkie, and an art fanatic.</p>
<p>I also try to be a good person. 2012 was a very hard year for me and my family. Marriages ended. Jobs were lost. Health declined. It was tough.</p>
<p>But we got through that, and now I'd like to give something back. Will you help?</p>

<p><span>You could, and that would be great. Here is the link where you can make that donation:</span></p>

<p>However, if you donate to this project, I will add blood, sweat, and elbow grease to turn your donation into something greater--not only a greater donation down the road, but a new model where readers and writers come together to make the world a better place just by doing what they enjoy.</p>
<p><span>In short, your donation here is the ripple that starts the wave!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why Support Crowdfunded Reading?</h2>
<p>Writing projects typically do very poorly on crowdfunding sites. In fact, publishing ranks <strong>second-to-last</strong> on overall funding success rate.</p>
<p>Some might argue that's because people don't read anymore, but I don't think that's it.</p>
<p>It's easy to hear a sample of someone's music or look at a concept sketch for a new graphic novel and decide if you'll like it or not.</p>
<p>But if I tell you, ""these stories are going to be awesome!"" you'll naturally be skeptical, and there's no easy way for me convince you this project is worth your money.</p>
<p>And so your dollar goes to other cool projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why an Anthology?</h2>
<p>It's like finding new music. The hardest part is knowing where to look and who to trust.</p>
<p>There has been an <strong>EXPLOSION</strong> of indie writers in the last few years. The market is flooded. I think we all know there is some really good stuff out there. But how do you find it?</p>
<p>That's my job. Think of this anthology like a <strong>new music sampler</strong>. You probably won't love everything, but you'll <em>at least</em> find a few new authors that really speak to you.</p>
<p>Go find those author's other works, and now you've got a month's worth of additional awesome reading, or more.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How Will It Work?</h2>
<p>First, we need to hit our goal. That has to be step one. And please don't assume that will just magically happen without your help, <strong>'cuz it won't</strong>.</p>
<p>Second, thank you for being a nice person. It counts. And I notice it.</p>
<p>Third, once funded, I will get the word out through my network of fellow authors that we're accepting submissions between 3,000 and 30,000 words. This is paid work, so I know we'll get a massive response! I'll sift through the roughage and find 8-12 diamonds. I will then set the authors to work with an experienced fiction editor to polish, polish, polish and produce a real professional piece.</p>
<p>I will hire a talented cover artist, secure a limited print run, and deliver <strong>gold-plated awesomeness</strong> to your door. And you don't have to lift a finger.</p>
<p>While you're enjoying the stories, I will sell the remainder of the books to fund additional printing as necessary to cover future sales. I will also market the book online and at conventions, bookstores, coffee shops, concerts, churches, tattoo parlors, slaughterhouses, carnivals, and anywhere else good people like to hang out.</p>
<p>All the after-cost proceeds go to charity for as long as the book will sell.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where Will My Money Go?</h2>
<p>The short answer: <strong>to the artists</strong>, <strong>to overhead</strong>, <strong>to the kids</strong>. That's it.</p>
<p>Here's a quick break down:</p>
<p>~$3,600 to pay 8-12 artists a fair price for their work</p>
<p>+$2,000 for multiple rounds of professional editing</p>
<p>+$500 to pay for the creation of and license to great cover art</p>
<p>+$2,300 for formatting and a <em>very</em> limited print run</p>
<p>+$1,000 to cover campaign costs (indiegogo, PayPal, etc.)</p>
<p>+$800 in basic marketing expenses (such as listing the book, printing flyers, renting booth space, etc.) so people know to buy it for a worthy cause!</p>
<p>Minus $500 of my own money that I am putting up to support this project.</p>
<p><strong>$9,700 Total</strong></p>
<p>Obviously all of that is an approximation, but it's a good approximation based on professional experience. If anything, it's a little low.</p>
<p>In the <em>very</em> unlikely event we are over-funded--that more people pledge than are required to produce the work--the money will go to expand the print run so we can sell more to support St. Jude.</p>
<p>Let's kick some butt! </p>

<p> </p></div>","Hello. 
This project helps fight childhood cancer, supports independent artists, and entertains you. And it's ridiculously simple.
I'm Rick Wayne, and I'm a socially responsible author.
That doesn't mean I write about the environment or social justice. It means I want to make the act of reading a social good (not just a personal one).
I want you to help the world even when you're enjoying amazing stories about wizards or counter-terrorists or renegade lovers or explosions in space.
I mean, why can't we enjoy ourselves and be socially conscious at the same time?
I think we can.
But I can't do it alone.
I'm organizing an anthology of eclectic short fiction for release later this year. The authors will all be talented independents writing cutting-edge stories on all kinds of crazy ideas (not just socially conscious ones).
Here's where you come in.
The business end of a book, much like the business end of a horse, is an active and smelly thing. It takes a lot of feed to write, edit, cover design, format, and produce an awesome book.
And we're going for awesome here.
I'll cull the best in indie short fiction, have it professionally edited, and deliver awesomeness to your door... that is, if you're willing to help.
Here's why you should, why this project is different:
First, you get something right now, a novella called Agony in Violet, and you get to keep it whether we meet our goal or not. (Some of you may have it already!)
Second, all proceeds from the ongoing sale of the finished anthology will go to St. Jude's Children's Hospital, because I believe there's nothing more awesome than helping sick kids. Period.
There are lots of worthy projects out there, I know. But I'm not aware of any that make your dollar do so much at once.
I hope you'll support this project, and have fun too.
Be Good. And happy reading. :)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome to my campaign. A Saudi Life is a fictional novel that I have had in my head for a few years now and never got around to get it out. Its basically the story of Saudi man and his friends starting with high school in the 90s all the way to today. While its fictional it does get much of its inspiration from my personal life and the lives of my family and friends. In the novel we explore Saudi Arabia and the evolution of culture and politics starting with the end of the Gulf war to the Arab spring. This is basically an insider story of the Saudi culture.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Author</h3>
<p>I'm a 37 year old male native of Saudi Arabia. I was born and raised in Riyadh and have spent about 12 years of my life abroad either as a child or an adult. I've been happily married for the last 2 and a half years to a great and supportive local doctor. Some of you might know me from my old podcasts. A Saudi Life was a podcast hosted and produced by me talking about Saudi Arabia and its culture. I also had the pleasure to guest a number of time on The Phileas Club podcast.</p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I have always wanted to write this novel but never had the energy or the time to do so. As this has been long overdue and thinking about it is taking more energy then just writing it I decided it was time to do it. However, I am not a writer, I'm just a person with a story which means I would need a professional editor  to work with me on this project. I estimate that this would cost around USD5000 at minimum. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>Please check the perks to the right --&gt;<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For many Saudi Arabia is a mystery and for some their knowledge of Saudi Arabia is limited, even those that visit or live in Saudi Arabia from the western expat community don't always get to know Saudi Arabia and their knowledge is limited to a specific part of society, the western educated middle and upper class or the tourist view. Very few people outside of Saudi Arabia experience or understand Saudi culture from a family perspective on many levels and no better way to learn about Saudi then to read it in a novel. This is a fictional novel so its meant as entertaiment first but its also meant to introduce Saudi culture from the perspective of a Saudi and its important to give a true image about the culture its self.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word and inform your friends and family about this project and let your social network know about it.</p>
<h3>Sample</h3>
<p>I am working on two approaches to a novel, one is Sci-Fi futuristic view of Saudi Arabia, this would be my next project. For this funding I want to work on the story of a local saudi man starting in 1992 with the gulf war and his days in high school up to current time. The following is an extremely rough draft of the first couple of pages. This is only to give an idea of what I'm doing, it is in no way an example of what the final product would be.</p>
<blockquote>""<br/>It's a new year and I’m back to school transferring to my first year in secondary school. Its been a hard last year, Saddams Armies invaded Kuwait and all hell broke loss. Saudi Arabia has been in a state of war for the first time in its history since its unification in 1932. Life has been weird and crazy the last year with schools closed most of the time and people moving all around the country trying to move away from the range of the scud missiles Sadam unleashed on us, recruitment camps for volunteers 16 years or older were established under the pressure and demand of the population to play a part in defending the country, the patriotic fever has reached its ultimest level in the country. Thousands of Kuwaiti refugees moved to Saudi including the royal family. This also coincided with the deployment of  US forces in Saudi as a major part of the international coalition to protect Saudi and liberate Kuwait, which didn’t go smoothly with many Saudis who saw it either as a symbol of weakness to depend on others or saw it as an invasion of infidels to the holy lands. But little did the Saudi government have an option in the matter, Saudi forces were small compared to irags one million man force and with little to no real combat experience compared to Iraqs 7 year war experience with Iran, plus Iraq was massing an assault on the Saudi Kuwaiti boarders, at least that’s what the US and their satellite photos claimed, if you ask some till this day they would tell you those photos were brushed and the iraqi forces were building defenses and not an assault, but that’s the past and what happened happened.<br/>Oh ya I forgot, let me introduce my self. My name is Faisal AlKhalidy from Saudi Arabia, born and raised in Riyadh city but my family originally descends from the Qassim region just north of Riyadh city. I’m 16 years old and starting my first year in secondary school I guess its called high school in the USA. My father is Naseer AlKhalidy an accountant for the Ministry of Defense, my mother is Haia AlMishary a house wife and a great mother. I have three brothers and one sister. I’m the oldest in the family. We live in one of Riyadh's modern middle class neighborhoods in the north called AlOliya. I love it here it’s a bit more modern then the rest of Riyadh with more of a western style. Our house is decent and average for a middle class family. Its about 650 square meters with a small guardin, a room for the chufer, 5 bedrooms, mens guest living room, women guest living room, family living room, dinning room, kitchen, and 6 bathrooms.<br/>Man I miss summer vacation, waking up so early is no fun, “Mom close those curtness the light is annoying” I shout out as my mother enters my room and opens the curtness to let the sun light in and wake me up. “Its 6 am and the drive to school takes half an hour so get out of bed and get ready it’s a school day not a vacation anymore.” she says that as she turns the AC off and exits my room and continues her morning routine of waking me and my brothers and sister up. 6 am, man I got used to sleeping in till 12 pm if I wanted. I start to lazily move out of bed, man its cold that AC works great at night. I finally get out of bed and head to the bathroom. I look into the mirror and man do I look horrible, I got so used at staying up late during summer that I didn’t sleep till 2 am last night. I brush my teeth and wash up and then perform wodu, woudu is a ritual washing that muslims need to perform before praying, start out with washing the hands, followed by the mouth then the nose, the face, arms. hair and ears and finally the feet. I didn’t wake up to perform the fajer (sunrise) prayer today so better late then never. I exit the bathroom and there on my desk I find a hot glass of milk, I guess the maid brought it in while I was washing up. My mom has gotten us used to having a glass of milk every morning just before school. I’ll just let it cool down a bit while I pray and change into my school clothes. Its nice to have your own room, I feel sorry for Ali and Saad, my youngest two brothers, they have to share a room together and do they fight a lot. Ya I got my own room with a bathroom, Fahad the oldest of my brothers has his own room but shares the bathroom with Ali and Saad, Nora my sister has her own bedroom with a bathroom because shes the only girl even though shes the youngest. Of-course my mom and dad have their own room as well. I finish praying and head to the closet where I get my clothes for school out. Well nothing special for school, we wear what we usually wear everyday here in Saudi a thob and a somaq. A thob is like a shirt that is body length usually white specially during summer and a somag is a cloth that we wear on our heads. Its traditional Saudi clothes, we also usually wear an uqal to hold the somaq to our heads but its baned in school as some students used it as a weapon, an oqal is like a thick circular rope and can be painful if you hit someone with it. After I get my clothes on I check my bag, got a notebook and pencils, hope we get our books today. I drink my milk and exit my room. In the family living room I find my mom relaxing and having a cup of coffee, my dad is still asleep he won’t wake up for another hour. I head to my mom kiss her forehead and sit down beside her as we wait for the rest of my brothers and sister to come down.""</blockquote>
<h3>Timeframe</h3>
<p>The plan is to publish the book by the end of 2014. It might happen sooner but I rather give myself a years worth of flexibility.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">There are two main challenges, one is the finding the right editor to help with the book. The second is writing the book, this is a challenge for any writer.

I’m the oldest in the family. We live in one of Riyadh's modern middle class neighborhoods in the north called AlOliya. I love it here it’s a bit more modern then the rest of Riyadh with more of a western style. Our house is decent and average for a middle class family. Its about 650 square meters with a small guardin, a room for the chufer, 5 bedrooms, mens guest living room, women guest living room, family living room, dinning room, kitchen, and 6 bathrooms.Man I miss summer vacation, waking up so early is no fun, “Mom close those curtness the light is annoying” I shout out as my mother enters my room and opens the curtness to let the sun light in and wake me up. “Its 6 am and the drive to school takes half an hour so get out of bed and get ready it’s a school day not a vacation anymore.” she says that as she turns the AC off and exits my room and continues her morning routine of waking me and my brothers and sister up. 6 am, man I got used to sleeping in till 12 pm if I wanted. I start to lazily move out of bed, man its cold that AC works great at night. I finally get out of bed and head to the bathroom. I look into the mirror and man do I look horrible, I got so used at staying up late during summer that I didn’t sleep till 2 am last night. I brush my teeth and wash up and then perform wodu, woudu is a ritual washing that muslims need to perform before praying, start out with washing the hands, followed by the mouth then the nose, the face, arms. hair and ears and finally the feet. I didn’t wake up to perform the fajer (sunrise) prayer today so better late then never. I exit the bathroom and there on my desk I find a hot glass of milk, I guess the maid brought it in while I was washing up. My mom has gotten us used to having a glass of milk every morning just before school. I’ll just let it cool down a bit while I pray and change into my school clothes. Its nice to have your own room, I feel sorry for Ali and Saad, my youngest two brothers, they have to share a room together and do they fight a lot. Ya I got my own room with a bathroom, Fahad the oldest of my brothers has his own room but shares the bathroom with Ali and Saad, Nora my sister has her own bedroom with a bathroom because shes the only girl even though shes the youngest. Of-course my mom and dad have their own room as well. I finish praying and head to the closet where I get my clothes for school out. Well nothing special for school, we wear what we usually wear everyday here in Saudi a thob and a somaq. A thob is like a shirt that is body length usually white specially during summer and a somag is a cloth that we wear on our heads. Its traditional Saudi clothes, we also usually wear an uqal to hold the somaq to our heads but its baned in school as some students used it as a weapon, an oqal is like a thick circular rope and can be painful if you hit someone with it. After I get my clothes on I check my bag, got a notebook and pencils, hope we get our books today. I drink my milk and exit my room. In the family living room I find my mom relaxing and having a cup of coffee, my dad is still asleep he won’t wake up for another hour. I head to my mom kiss her forehead and sit down beside her as we wait for the rest of my brothers and sister to come down.""
Timeframe
The plan is to publish the book by the end of 2014. It might happen sooner but I rather give myself a years worth of flexibility.

Risks and challenges
There are two main challenges, one is the finding the right editor to help with the book. The second is writing the book, this is a challenge for any writer. I do intend to get this book written and published, reaching the funding goal means it will happen in 2014.FAQPlease ask in the comment section or by email saudi@asaudilife.net I will respond to all comments and questions as time permits and will post questions and answers here as I receive them.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Who is Dusty Pierre and what is the story about?</strong></p>
<p>Dusty Pierre is quite the unusual robot. His curiosity takes him on thrilling adventures across the galaxy. In our first story, called ""Dusty Pierre's Secret Search of Love,"" Dusty wants to experience first-hand this feeling humans call love and it takes him on a secret mission to Earth to a city called Paris. Along the way, he experiences a variety of new feelings including sadness, joy, frustration, disappointment, perseverance and ultimately, love.  If you have a few minutes to watch our short video, you can see, in more detail, what the story is about.  We envision an entire series of short stories around Dusty Pierre's adventures.  This is only the beginning!</p>

<p><strong>Who is behind this project?</strong></p>
<p>Hi.  My name is Troy Green.  My passion for writing short stories and working with artists was discovered about three years ago as a hobby, while working in a career on the complete opposite side of the spectrum as a business analyst. Evenings and weekends were spent exploring this interest and although it started out as a hobby, just recently I realized how much pleasure this brought to my life and decided to take a huge leap out of the corporate world to follow my dreams of writing short stories full-time. Along the way, I have been fortunate enough to meet a special artist named Ivo Kozarov. His extraordinary artistic skills, hard work, and ability to understand my vision of characters and storylines is a huge reason why we have come this far. Both of us have worked together for the past year in building a portfolio of around 50 unique robot and alien characters as well as our first short story called “Dusty Pierre’s Secret Search of Love”. We hope this campaign can launch us into the world of creating and self-publishing children’s books.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/718064/pictures/original/20130322083404-revised_team.png?1363966443"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>

<p><strong><strong>Why Indiegogo</strong></strong></p>
<p>We’ve applied a great deal of time building “Dusty Pierre’s Secret Search of Love,” creating more than 25+ scenes.  We carefully depict each scene to fit and flow with the storyline.  Most of the scenes are currently only sketches. To turn this into a completed story with full illustrations and self-publish as a paperback book, will require a lot more time. If we are fortunate enough to gather enough funds from this campaign, we want to turn Dusty Pierre’s first adventure to life and self-publish our first paperback book. The paperback book will ultimately include over 40+ pages. Indiegogo provides us an opportunity to potentially gather enough funds to continue this exciting venture.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is to raise at least $20,000.  Keep in mind that 40-45% of total funds will actually be used for costs of gifts for our generous supporters, particulalry books, while another 9% of costs will go to Indiegogo, unless of course we meet our goal.  Because total costs of the campaign will be around 55% of total funds, the first $8,000 of campaign funds will be used to help pay for the fantastic illustration work Ivo will do to complete the book.  After costs of the first $8,000 of funds, that leaves me around $3,700 to pay for illustration work. Every dollar past the first $8,000 of funds wil go directly towards print costs to build a small inventory of books that will be used for local bookstores around the San Francisco Bay area. </p>
<p>To give you an idea of the time needed for illustration work, each of the 25-30 color illustrations for the book can take many hours to create from start to finish. It's a fairly demanding task, especially given the short time frame to complete.  We will then convert each of the illustrations and storyline into a printer friendly format for books.</p>
<p>Longer term, we hope to turn ""The Adventures of Dusty Pierre"" into a popular series with added accompaniments such as coloring books, action figures, games, stickers, posters, bedroom/bathroom sets, and hopefully someday, short animated films. But for now, we are focused on getting our first book published and we are grateful for anything you can provide. Our dream is to do this full-time. Not just a career, but as an adventure!</p>
<p><strong>What if we don't meet our goal?</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost I want to pay Ivo for his fantastic illustration work, that is the number one goal.   All funds under $8,000 will help me pay for illustration work.  Any dollar above $8,000 will go towards building a small inventory of our first book.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></p>
<p>If we are fortunate and lucky enough to surpass our initial goal of $20,000, the funds will go directly towards developing our second book called ""Dusty Pierre and Guapo Chop It Up!"". The storyline takes place back on the space ship where Dusty decides to take a sushi cooking class with master chef El Guapo and his mini chefs.  During the cooking class Dusty gets distracted with using chop sticks to attempt catching a fly.  One of the mini chefs takes this personally and gives Dusty the glare.  A few minutes later Dusty again attempts to catch a fly and the mini chef is now upset.  El Guapo, the big chef steps in and ultimately turns into a brief chop stick fight.  </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/716510/pictures/full/20130329105526-Chops_It_Up.jpg?1364579735"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My dream is to do this venture full-time working with a variety of talented artists from all over the world, building multiple storylines, characters, games, and merchandise around each of the storylines.  10-15 years from now I want to be in direct competition with Disney.  I believe stretch goals for this are out of reach and unrealistic, but if we somehow manage to exceed $40,000 this would fullfill my dream of pursing this venture full-time.</p>
<p><strong>Why not go to a publishing house?</strong></p>
<p><span style="""">Although working with a publishing house is a great option for many writers, they tend to give very little control and ownership to original writers and illustrators. Since we are completely new to the industry, we will have little negotiating leverage with potential publishing houses on ownership and commission rates.

<p><span style="""">We not only want the ability to build relationships with local bookstores, but also to have full control over pricing of our books at any time, particularly for marketing efforts during seasonal time frames and discounting.

<p><span style="""">There has always been something about the look and feel of a real tangible copy of a children’s book.

I fund my adventures by crafting non-commercial indie travel media at the crux of race, place and adventure, but for the past 3 years, all my cash saved from dead-end jobs has gone to paying for my extensive medical care.</p><p></p><h3>About VONA</h3><p></p><p>VONA/Voices is the nation's only multi-genre workshop for writers of color, and I'm lucky to have been accepted to join in this June! I come from a single-parent, working-class, immigrant household in New York, and opportunities like this are rare, Even if I had finished high school and gone to college, I still wouldn't have gotten a writing coach of color who focuses on travel! Spaces like these are really important for people like me in this white, straight, male-dominated industry. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Gist</h3><p>Since 2011, I've been struggling with chronic pain in the right side of my body, emanating from tears in my shoulder. Without access to health insurance in the States, I've been traveling back and forth to Ecuador (where my family is from) for treatment, and underwent surgery last Fall. Though it was unsuccessful, I still owe over $1,000 for it, and continue to pay out of pocket for medical expenses. Since the pain has expanded toward my right hand, writing for more than 30 minutes a day (as well as basic functions) has become impossible, meaning I can't work for a living. I'm stuck in a situation where I can't pay for my healthcare and can't get better without it. Lame!</p><p>But I'm not asking for help with my medical costs. A flight from Ecuador to California runs about $700 (with luck) and though the fine folks at VONA have fronted half of my tuition in financial aid, I still owe them $300. I'm asking for at least $900 to help with these costs - but anything at all would be mad mad mad appreciated!</p><p>In exchange, I'm offering my zines, photos and writing services as perks!</p><p>Every single contributor will receive the zine Dispatches: Conversations with Writers of Color on Race, Place &amp; Adventure, which is a series of interviews I'm conducting in conjunction with this crowdfunding campaign on baniamor.com.

I fund my adventures by crafting non-commercial indie travel media at the crux of race, place and adventure, but for the past 3 years, all my cash saved from dead-end jobs has gone to paying for my extensive medical care.About VONAVONA/Voices is the nation's only multi-genre workshop for writers of color, and I'm lucky to have been accepted to join in this June! I come from a single-parent, working-class, immigrant household in New York, and opportunities like this are rare, Even if I had finished high school and gone to college, I still wouldn't have gotten a writing coach of color who focuses on travel! Spaces like these are really important for people like me in this white, straight, male-dominated industry. The GistSince 2011, I've been struggling with chronic pain in the right side of my body, emanating from tears in my shoulder. Without access to health insurance in the States, I've been traveling back and forth to Ecuador (where my family is from) for treatment, and underwent surgery last Fall. Though it was unsuccessful, I still owe over $1,000 for it, and continue to pay out of pocket for medical expenses. Since the pain has expanded toward my right hand, writing for more than 30 minutes a day (as well as basic functions) has become impossible, meaning I can't work for a living. I'm stuck in a situation where I can't pay for my healthcare and can't get better without it. Lame!But I'm not asking for help with my medical costs. A flight from Ecuador to California runs about $700 (with luck) and though the fine folks at VONA have fronted half of my tuition in financial aid, I still owe them $300. I'm asking for at least $900 to help with these costs - but anything at all would be mad mad mad appreciated!In exchange, I'm offering my zines, photos and writing services as perks!Every single contributor will receive the zine Dispatches: Conversations with Writers of Color on Race, Place & Adventure, which is a series of interviews I'm conducting in conjunction with this crowdfunding campaign on baniamor.com.

la que vivimos. El <i>vaulting</i> ayuda a elevar autoestima,<span>  mejorar la fuerza física y  mental, promover el trabajo en equipo y
convivir con la naturaleza y los caballos. Una vez que te paras en un caballo
en movimiento, sabes que ¡Cualquier cosa se puede lograr! </span></p>
<p><span>El <i>vaulting</i>  se empezó a practicar en México hace más de 10 años. </span>Alejandra Orozco Vizcaíno, quien nos
representará en estas competencias, fue la primera mexicana en representar a su
país en una competencia internacional de <i>vaulting</i> (CVI).<span> En el 2013 México participó por primera vez en una CVI, donde Alejandra obtuvo
el 3er lugar. Ella ha estado entrenando y preparándose para competir en
Australia en Marzo. Lo único que falta es tu apoyo para lograrlo!</span></p>

</h3><p>Hi, my name is Alejandra. I'm a Mexican vaulter and my goal this year is to qualify for the World Equestrian Games (WEG) and represent México. If you're not a horse person, WEG is like the equivalent of the Olympics for horse sports, it happens every four years and it's HUGE.<br/>I have been getting sponsors to cover some of my training trips and competition costs, but I still need all the help I can get to make it through the year and be able to go to all the qualifying competitions. <br/>To qualify for WEG, I basically have to climb the competition ladder. There's three levels of competition, all of them have scoring from 0-10 kind of like gymnastics:<br/>1* CVI: which is the first level that I competed at last year. I already got the score I needed for that one!<br/>2* CVI: I need a 6.5 for this one, which is in Australia in a little over a month! <br/>3* CVI: This is the highest international level. I need a 7.0 and I'm giving myself 2 opportunities: one in California and the second in Canada, both in May. Once I get this score I'm qualified to compete at WEG since I'm the only Mexican who's ever competed internationally.<br/><br/>I've been focusing on my training and doing everything I can to get the scores I need.

She will be representing México in the first CVI of the season. We would like to thank everyone who either through donations or likes and shares on facebook and email made this possible. This is just the beginning of the story. After Australia there are two other competitions where she needs to qualify to compete in the World Equestrian Games in Normandy. There are 52 hours left on the campaign, any funds raised during this period will go directly towards competition entry fees and horse expenses for the competitions in California and Canada.Our biggest priority now is to let as many people know that there is vaulting in México. It's not just a dream anymore, it's real! So share this with anyone and everyone, let's reach the 2,000 visits!!¡GRACIAS!¡Hemos juntado suficientes fondos para mandar a Alejandra a representar a México en Australia! Nos gustaría agradecer a todos los que han formado parte de esta campaña y ya sea con donaciones o publicidad en facebook han hecho esto posible.Este es sólo el comienzo de la historia. Después de Australia, México (representado por Alejandra) participará en dos competencias más. En ellas será necesario obtener el puntaje requerido para competir en los Juegos Ecuestres Mundiales en Normandía.Quedan 52 horas en esta campaña, todos los fondos que se obtengan a partir de este momento serán destinados en su totalidad a las entradas y gastos de caballos para estas dos competencias en California y Canadá.Nuestra meta ahora es que la mayor cantidad de gente posible sepa que en México tenemos vaulting. Ya no es sólo un sueño, ¡Es una realidad! Así es que comparte esta campaña con todos y vamos por las 2,000 visitas!!¡Ayúdanos a hacer historia!En Pro Vaulting México, nuestro objetivo es promover el vaulting. 
Estamos orgullosos de que por primera
vez, México tiene oportunidad de mandar a una seleccionada en vaulting a los
Juegos Ecuestres Mundiales. Para convertir este sueño en realidad, nuestra
representante tiene el reto de calificar en 3 competencias internacionales: Australia,
California y Canadá. ¡Confiamos en que entre todos lograremos esta meta!
El vaulting es un deporte muy interesante
donde la persona va bailando arriba de un caballo al galope ( http://www.fei.org/fei/disc/vaulting/about ). Con tu
contribución lograremos que México tenga una mayor participación a nivel
internacional. La meta es poder promover este deporte y mejorar la sociedad en
la que vivimos. El vaulting ayuda a elevar autoestima,  mejorar la fuerza física y  mental, promover el trabajo en equipo y
convivir con la naturaleza y los caballos. Una vez que te paras en un caballo
en movimiento, sabes que ¡Cualquier cosa se puede lograr! 
El vaulting  se empezó a practicar en México hace más de 10 años. Alejandra Orozco Vizcaíno, quien nos
representará en estas competencias, fue la primera mexicana en representar a su
país en una competencia internacional de vaulting (CVI). En el 2013 México participó por primera vez en una CVI, donde Alejandra obtuvo
el 3er lugar. Ella ha estado entrenando y preparándose para competir en
Australia en Marzo. Lo único que falta es tu apoyo para lograrlo!
Tú puedes ser parte de esta gran historia, ayúdanos a lograr y superar la meta!

Canada. We know that with your help we can make this happen!!Vaulting is an equestrian sport where a dance routine is performed on a

<p>God designed marriage to play a
pivotal role in His strategy for battle against the evil one. He intended the
differences between men and women to give us a tactical advantage, but the

battle back-to-back against the real enemy, defending each other’s greatest

<p>Hello, I’m Rebecca D. Bruner, an
author, retreat speaker, and Bible teacher with over twenty-five years’
experience in women’s ministries. Through my study of the Bible and my
twenty-eight-year relationship with my husband, God has revealed many vital
truths and insights to me regarding marriage. I wrote <i>A Wife of Valor: Your Strategic Importance in God’s Battle Plan </i>to
pass on the crucial lessons I have learned to other Christian wives. My hope is
that readers will apply these biblical principles to strengthen their
marriages, and perhaps avoid a few of my mistakes.</p>
<p>During my research for this book,
I was surprised to discover that women file for divorce twice as often as men
do. <i>A Wife of Valor</i> will help women
evaluate the success of their relationships on the basis of God’s goals and
design, rather than merely their personal satisfaction. Such a resource could
play a crucial role in saving many marriages.</p>
<p>By contributing to
this campaign, you will help uphold the biblical model of marriage as a
reflection of Christ’s relationship with his bride, the church. You will help
preserve and pass on these principles to upcoming generations. Each chapter includes questions which can be used for group discussion or personal
reflection, making it a valuable resource for counselors and mentors who want
to empower young women to serve God in their calling as wives.</p>

<p><i><strong>“There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.”</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>― Maya Angelou, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</strong></i></p>
<p>I have asked myself this question. “How can I use my position, knowledge of publishing, writing, editing, and sharing stories to help create additional contributions to the literary world that is diverse, equitable, and doesn’t just represent the same segment of society it always has since its inception? What concrete actions can I take to make actual change and move beyond the tired conversation we’ve been having for decades about the lack of diversity in publishing?”</p>
<p><i><strong>“Stories you read when you're the right age never quite leave you. You may forget who wrote them or what the story was called. Sometimes you'll forget precisely what happened, but if a story touches you it will stay with you, haunting the places in your mind that you rarely ever visit.”</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>― Neil Gaiman, M Is for Magi</strong></i></p>
<p>Continuing my efforts in self-publishing stories and voices of people living with HIV was the answer. Yours support will allow Not Our Status But Our Stories to speak the voices and stories of those under- represented in publishing. Together will be allow the stories and history of our collective community to be told.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact of Not Out Status But Our Stories </strong>will create and build community through publishing where, “A person is a person through other people' strikes an affirmation of one’s humanity through recognition of an ‘other’ in his or her uniqueness and difference. It is a demand for a creative inter-subjective formation in which the ‘other’ becomes a mirror (but only a mirror) for my subjectivity. This idealism suggests to us that humanity is not embedded in my person solely as an individual; my humanity is co-substantively bestowed upon the other and me. Humanity is a quality we owe to each other. We create each other and need to sustain this otherness creation. And if we belong to each other, we participate in our creations: we are because you are, and since you are, I am. The ‘I am’ is not a rigid subject, but a dynamic self-constitution dependent on this otherness creation of relation and distance”.</p>

The Impact
“There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.”
― Maya Angelou, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings
I have asked myself this question. “How can I use my position, knowledge of publishing, writing, editing, and sharing stories to help create additional contributions to the literary world that is diverse, equitable, and doesn’t just represent the same segment of society it always has since its inception? What concrete actions can I take to make actual change and move beyond the tired conversation we’ve been having for decades about the lack of diversity in publishing?”
“Stories you read when you're the right age never quite leave you. You may forget who wrote them or what the story was called. Sometimes you'll forget precisely what happened, but if a story touches you it will stay with you, haunting the places in your mind that you rarely ever visit.”
― Neil Gaiman, M Is for Magi
Continuing my efforts in self-publishing stories and voices of people living with HIV was the answer. Yours support will allow Not Our Status But Our Stories to speak the voices and stories of those under- represented in publishing. Together will be allow the stories and history of our collective community to be told.
The Impact of Not Out Status But Our Stories will create and build community through publishing where, “A person is a person through other people' strikes an affirmation of one’s humanity through recognition of an ‘other’ in his or her uniqueness and difference. It is a demand for a creative inter-subjective formation in which the ‘other’ becomes a mirror (but only a mirror) for my subjectivity. This idealism suggests to us that humanity is not embedded in my person solely as an individual; my humanity is co-substantively bestowed upon the other and me. Humanity is a quality we owe to each other. We create each other and need to sustain this otherness creation. And if we belong to each other, we participate in our creations: we are because you are, and since you are, I am. The ‘I am’ is not a rigid subject, but a dynamic self-constitution dependent on this otherness creation of relation and distance”.

<p><strong>WHAT IS BIG SHARED WORLD ALL ABOUT?</strong></p>
<p>The Big Shared World project was born out of my frustration with our world today. While we seem to be plugged in and hyperconnected, many people also feel equally isolated. Even when friends get together physically, they may be more immersed in their phones than the conversation “in real life.”</p>
<p>Looking beyond the personal, I also saw people, myself included, experiencing a disconnection from even the most pressing global issues. Sure, we have unprecedented, 24-hour, exposure to news updates, if we want it, but most people I know keep plenty busy managing their own lives, and lack the time to examine how their daily actions contribute to the bigger picture. People all too often feel removed from the heavier issues, as if they are someone else’s problems to solve. While I understand this reaction, I worry that our disengagement could be detrimental for all of us.</p>
<p>At a crossroads in my own life, I had been considering what it was like to be a millennial during this unique moment in history. When that consideration broadened to include what it was like to be a <i>human</i> at this unique moment in history, I decided the only way to learn the answer to that question was to talk with as many humans, from as wide-ranging backgrounds as I reasonably could. I decided to put all my resources together and design a travel project that addressed these growing concerns I was experiencing. Thus, the seed for Big Shared World was sown.</p>
<p>From there, I consulted friends, colleagues, and pretty much anyone who would give me their opinion, seeking a base of three questions to ask those I came across in my travels. After much consideration, I settled on these, as most likely to develop the kind of deep conversation I was seeking:  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486093946/iejgmfq0uj3ljdxz2jzp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>These three questions served as a controlled element in an otherwise spontaneous journey around the world. While international travel on its own can change a person’s perspective and broaden their worldview, these three questions allowed for a consistent thread to anchor my interactions, no matter where I was in the world. The initial Big Shared World mission was “3 Questions. 30 Countries. 300 People.” <strong>Nearly 15 months later, I had surpassed my goal, and had asked my three questions of over 700 people in 40 countries across six continents!</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486365457/ceabnmlrid09sji35tue.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>During that time, Big Shared World, which had started as my personal project, developed into a community. This community was built on genuine, mutual curiosity and a reciprocal desire to truly connect. Every person who took the time to respond to my questions helped elevate the project. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>The Big Shared World journey began with the inception of the idea and continues to this day. I actually traveled from October 2014 through December 2015. During this period, I traveled on six regional legs—alighting in either Minnesota or Washington DC in between legs to rest, reconnect with friends and family, and repack for the next region! </p>
<p>In 2016, with BSW travels complete, I focused on processing my experiences and interactions, and finding the framework for the story I had to tell. To do so, I worked with book coaches, attended writer conferences, and spent a lot of time processing working on putting the experience of the journey into book form. I also worked with a data guru to help me make sense of the more than 700 responses to my three questions through a more thorough analysis process. </p>
<p>The first half of 2017 will focus on advancing the book’s production process. With a summer publication date, the journey will continue as I work to bring the BSW story to a wider audience. From anecdotes to underlying wisdom gleaned, I look forward to sharing the insights and important takeaways from the project.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT COMES NEXT FOR BIG SHARED WORLD?</strong></p>
<p>Just as a small idea turned into the most amazing big adventure, my hope is that this campaign will help define the way forward for Big Shared World. The book production and launch is important, but it is only one part of the bigger picture. Ideally, support for this campaign will garner opportunities to further showcase the importance of embracing curiosity and working together—so we all feel prepared to address the big issues facing our dynamic, fragile world.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS THE BSW BOOK ALL ABOUT?</strong></p>
<p>The BSW book is part travel journal (think, Bill Bryson), part spiritual memoir (think, idealistic millennial meets <i>Eat Pray Love</i>), and part sociological thesis (except, not boring!). As you read, you’ll follow my experiences from the birth of the BSW idea, across six continents, and back home to the United States, where I start to make sense of it all. Along the way, you’ll meet hundreds of people from around the globe who enter into deeply meaningful conversation about the modern world we all share.</p>
<p>It has been said that “Man travels the world over in search of what he needs and returns home to find it.” I discovered the truth in those words, certainly. But I have also come to understand what author Pat Conroy means when he says, “Once you have traveled, the voyage never ends, but is played out over and over again in the quietest chambers. The mind can never break off from the journey.”</p>
<p>The BSW book is both my opportunity to share my journey with you—and to play it out over and over again, gleaning more insight with each new reflection upon it.</p>

<p>The Big Shared World journey was brought to life with the help of hundreds of people from all around the world. What better way to publish its results than with a crowdfunding campaign?</p>

<p><strong>WHAT DOES THE BOOK EDITING AND DESIGN PROCESS ENTAIL?</strong></p>
<p>The following are some of the larger components included:</p>
<p><strong><i><u>Developmental Edit</u></i></strong><strong><i> -</i></strong> This includes a full reading of the manuscript by an editor who will indicate where the story could be expanded or trimmed, address confusing passages, and suggest where revisions could be made throughout.  <i>(approx $3000)</i></p>
<p><strong><i><u>Copyedit</u></i></strong><strong><i> -</i></strong> A copyeditor will fix misspellings, verb tense issues, errors in character names or continuity, and make sure edits from the first round of developmental editing didn't introduce any new errors or break style. <i>(approx $3000)</i></p>
<p><strong><i><u>Layout Design</u></i></strong><strong><i> -</i></strong> A custom interior design of a book includes fonts, formatting, and styles used throughout a book. Coming up with a consistent template for each chapter maintains consistency and readability throughout the book. <i>(approx $2500)</i></p>
<p><strong><i><u>Proofread</u></i></strong><strong><i> -</i></strong> A proofreader goes through an edited, formatted book to look for any mistakes in the text, as well as any undesirable design elements.<i> (approx $1000)</i></p>
<p><strong><i><u>Cover Design</u></i></strong><strong><i> - </i></strong>Many people judge a book by its cover, so a quality design is important to the quality of the overall book. Cover and back cover design includes  marketing copy to tell the book’s story and details such as generating the barcode for selling purposes.<i> (approx $1000)</i></p>
<p><strong><i><u>Formatting + Publication Costs</u></i></strong> - Once the manuscript is print-ready, it will be available on Amazon and other book-selling platforms. Each has different requirements and fees associated. Also, the book will need an ISBN and other official components. <i>(approx $1000)</i></p>
<p><strong><i><u>Printing</u></i></strong> - Even authors have to pay for their books! Printing costs will cover books ordered through the campaign, as well as an initial run of books to share in marketing and publicity efforts. <i>(approx $2000)</i></p>
<p><strong><i><u>Campaign Logistics -</u></i></strong> Running a crowd fund campaign incurs costs such as video production, perk fulfillment, and transaction costs with Indiegogo and payment platforms. <i>(approx $2000)</i></p>

<p>The main goal for this campaign is to fund the editorial and design process for the BSW book. Upon reaching our goal, we will move forward with additional steps to achieve a successful book launch. We have brainstormed stretch goals that will help take the book and Big Shared World to the next level. Effective marketing can get a book off the shelf and into people’s hands. Setting longer term goals for Big Shared World will allow the BSW team to continue developing programs for engagement beyond the stories in the BSW book.</p>

<p>The Big Shared World team looks forward to amplifying the mission by developing partnerships and delivering materials that can help bring the message of BSW to more people. We hope that once the initial funding goal of $15,000 is met, we will be able to pursue our stretch goals in order to further expand the BSW project through marketing and outreach, as well as program and curriculum development.</p>

<p>This journey, this campaign, and this book are all about embracing curiosity and starting conversations that make people think. Contributing to this campaign is not just about helping to publish the stories in the BSW book, it is about joining me and the BSW team in our efforts to bring people together and start meaningful conversations about our Big Shared World, today. </p>

<p>Big Shared World would be just an idea if it wasn’t for the help of hundreds of people—people who answered the questions, welcomed me in their homes, offered suggestions and expertise. Everyone who made this journey come to life is part of the BSW Community!</p>
<p>In addition, the BSW team includes talented individuals and organizations who have supported the journey professionally.  </p>
<p><strong><i><u>Student Research Project</u></i></strong> - I was extremely fortunate to be taken on as a pro-bono client of <a href=""http://www.integrateddevelopmentgroup.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Integrated Development Group</a>, a student consulting group from University of the Pacific. During the course of the travel, IDG researched an extensive list of resources to help me find more information about various topics that struck me while traveling. The end result was a comprehensive, annotated bibliography that expanded my understanding of concepts ranging from climate change to geopolitics.</p>
<p><strong><i><u>Campaign Development + Management</u></i></strong> - Two talented students from IDG launched their own consulting firm after graduating. <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/meagankim1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Meagan Kim </a>and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/courtneybye"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Courtney Bye</a> of Sprout Consulting have been instrumental in developing this crowd fund campaign. From perk research to the beautiful graphics, this campaign launch has been a huge team effort. </p>
<p><strong><i><u>Website Design</u></i></strong> - While traveling, I re-connected with a friend in Vietnam from a study abroad program years back. The timing was perfect. I needed a better website, and his family had a web design company. My stay in Vietnam included lots of time in the <a href=""http://www.seadev.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Seadev</a> office, getting to know their brilliant team and sharing ideas for how the BSW story would best translate into a website. Their design team consistently impressed me as they took my vision and turned it into the most dazzling reality. I am always proud to send my website link to people, as I know it perfectly captures the essence of me and Big Shared World<i>. </i>We continue to work together, ensuring the website reflects the process of the project.</p>
<p><strong><i><u>Coaching/Book Editing</u></i></strong> - I have been fortunate to come across the most amazing people just when I need them. When I initially started to think about how the book would come together, I found Jamie Morris, book coach and editor, at <a href=""http://www.voiceheartvision.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VoiceHeartVision</a>. As I shared the highlights from my experiences, Jamie walked me through story development techniques that helped to illuminate the bigger themes and narrative arcs of the BSW story.</p>
<p>Then, after much time writing and rewriting, I found <a href=""http://www.carolinelambert.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Caroline Lambert</a>, a Washington DC-based editor and book coach. Caroline has been instrumental in building my confidence in the pages that fill the BSW book.</p>
<p>At an Airbnb conference on global hospitality and travel, I struck up a conversation with <a href=""https://www.gailbaral.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gail Baral</a>, an entrepreneur coach who has helped me to clarify my vision and goals, and continues to provide thoughtful counsel on the best way forward.  </p>
<p><strong><i><u>Data Analysis</u></i></strong> - The data analysis process started with IDG. While traveling, I wrote people’s answers in 10 bright red Moleskine notebooks, then meticulously transcribed them into a spreadsheet. IDG helped begin the methodical coding system needed to analyze the results of this social research project. Yigal Goldshtrom has taken over making sense of the 700+ responses. Not only are there answers to the three questions, but seven demographic questions and various sub-coded elements, as well. Yigal has made tackling this arduous task seem easy, and I look forward to sharing a more detailed analysis of the BSW answers.</p>
<p><strong><i><u>Campaign Video</u></i></strong> - The campaign video is a work of art by two incredibly talented individuals living on two different hemispheres! I connected with Ignacio Lidejover of <a href=""http://www.puertocfilms.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Puerto-C Films</a> in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Together, we wrote the video script. Then, I connected with Dietrich Wilke of <a href=""https://www.vimeo.com/fullframemediaservice"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Full Frame Media</a> to do the videography work for the film. Dietrich is a fellow Minnesotan, and together we spent two days capturing footage for the campaign video. By the power of the Internet, the three of us worked together, and Ignacio produced the most beautiful video as the focal point of the campaign. </p>

*Breakdown of costs are determined based on a word count of 75,000. 
 

WHAT DOES THE BOOK EDITING AND DESIGN PROCESS ENTAIL?
The following are some of the larger components included:
Developmental Edit - This includes a full reading of the manuscript by an editor who will indicate where the story could be expanded or trimmed, address confusing passages, and suggest where revisions could be made throughout.  (approx $3000)
Copyedit - A copyeditor will fix misspellings, verb tense issues, errors in character names or continuity, and make sure edits from the first round of developmental editing didn't introduce any new errors or break style. (approx $3000)
Layout Design - A custom interior design of a book includes fonts, formatting, and styles used throughout a book. Coming up with a consistent template for each chapter maintains consistency and readability throughout the book. (approx $2500)
Proofread - A proofreader goes through an edited, formatted book to look for any mistakes in the text, as well as any undesirable design elements. (approx $1000)
Cover Design - Many people judge a book by its cover, so a quality design is important to the quality of the overall book. Cover and back cover design includes  marketing copy to tell the book’s story and details such as generating the barcode for selling purposes. (approx $1000)
Formatting + Publication Costs - Once the manuscript is print-ready, it will be available on Amazon and other book-selling platforms. Each has different requirements and fees associated. Also, the book will need an ISBN and other official components. (approx $1000)
Printing - Even authors have to pay for their books! Printing costs will cover books ordered through the campaign, as well as an initial run of books to share in marketing and publicity efforts. (approx $2000)
Campaign Logistics - Running a crowd fund campaign incurs costs such as video production, perk fulfillment, and transaction costs with Indiegogo and payment platforms. (approx $2000)
 

The main goal for this campaign is to fund the editorial and design process for the BSW book. Upon reaching our goal, we will move forward with additional steps to achieve a successful book launch. We have brainstormed stretch goals that will help take the book and Big Shared World to the next level. Effective marketing can get a book off the shelf and into people’s hands. Setting longer term goals for Big Shared World will allow the BSW team to continue developing programs for engagement beyond the stories in the BSW book.

The Big Shared World team looks forward to amplifying the mission by developing partnerships and delivering materials that can help bring the message of BSW to more people. We hope that once the initial funding goal of $15,000 is met, we will be able to pursue our stretch goals in order to further expand the BSW project through marketing and outreach, as well as program and curriculum development.
 

WHAT DO I GET FOR MY CONTRIBUTION?
The fun of a crowdfund campaign is in the perks! Our perks are designed at all levels, with individuals and organizations in mind. For just $5, you can receive a handwritten thank you postcard from me, and YOUR NAME IN THE BOOK! The first print run of the BSW book will include a section in the back of the book listing all the contributors at this level and above. For $1500, I will send you 20 autographed copies of the book, then personally show up to your book club meeting to share in the stories of Big Shared World together!
For organizations, I look forward to sharing the insights from Big Shared World with your team! For just $500, we can have a customized consulting session over Skype. For $3000, I'll come to your organization and speak in person! All larger perks include a bulk purchase of the books. 
To keep the campaign fresh, there will be new perks launched throughout the campaign. Coming soon, my personal favorite is the BSW Travel Lover's Package which will be full of my favorite products for an on-the-go individual! If you contribute to the campaign early on, you'll be first to get updates of new perks added to the campaign. 
The perks in this campaign were sourced to include products from ethical companies with a social mission as part of their business models. For instance, the socks in the Book Lover’s Package are from Conscious Steps, a company that gives a portion of their sales to charitable causes. The passport holder in the Travel Lover’s Package is from 11:11, a small business in California that makes each product by hand, with love. 

This journey, this campaign, and this book are all about embracing curiosity and starting conversations that make people think. Contributing to this campaign is not just about helping to publish the stories in the BSW book, it is about joining me and the BSW team in our efforts to bring people together and start meaningful conversations about our Big Shared World, today. 
 

Big Shared World would be just an idea if it wasn’t for the help of hundreds of people—people who answered the questions, welcomed me in their homes, offered suggestions and expertise. Everyone who made this journey come to life is part of the BSW Community!
In addition, the BSW team includes talented individuals and organizations who have supported the journey professionally.  
Student Research Project - I was extremely fortunate to be taken on as a pro-bono client of Integrated Development Group, a student consulting group from University of the Pacific. During the course of the travel, IDG researched an extensive list of resources to help me find more information about various topics that struck me while traveling. The end result was a comprehensive, annotated bibliography that expanded my understanding of concepts ranging from climate change to geopolitics.
Campaign Development + Management - Two talented students from IDG launched their own consulting firm after graduating. Meagan Kim and Courtney Bye of Sprout Consulting have been instrumental in developing this crowd fund campaign. From perk research to the beautiful graphics, this campaign launch has been a huge team effort. 
Website Design - While traveling, I re-connected with a friend in Vietnam from a study abroad program years back. The timing was perfect. I needed a better website, and his family had a web design company. My stay in Vietnam included lots of time in the Seadev office, getting to know their brilliant team and sharing ideas for how the BSW story would best translate into a website. Their design team consistently impressed me as they took my vision and turned it into the most dazzling reality. I am always proud to send my website link to people, as I know it perfectly captures the essence of me and Big Shared World. We continue to work together, ensuring the website reflects the process of the project.
Coaching/Book Editing - I have been fortunate to come across the most amazing people just when I need them. When I initially started to think about how the book would come together, I found Jamie Morris, book coach and editor, at VoiceHeartVision. As I shared the highlights from my experiences, Jamie walked me through story development techniques that helped to illuminate the bigger themes and narrative arcs of the BSW story.
Then, after much time writing and rewriting, I found Caroline Lambert, a Washington DC-based editor and book coach. Caroline has been instrumental in building my confidence in the pages that fill the BSW book.
At an Airbnb conference on global hospitality and travel, I struck up a conversation with Gail Baral, an entrepreneur coach who has helped me to clarify my vision and goals, and continues to provide thoughtful counsel on the best way forward.  
Data Analysis - The data analysis process started with IDG. While traveling, I wrote people’s answers in 10 bright red Moleskine notebooks, then meticulously transcribed them into a spreadsheet. IDG helped begin the methodical coding system needed to analyze the results of this social research project. Yigal Goldshtrom has taken over making sense of the 700+ responses. Not only are there answers to the three questions, but seven demographic questions and various sub-coded elements, as well. Yigal has made tackling this arduous task seem easy, and I look forward to sharing a more detailed analysis of the BSW answers.
Campaign Video - The campaign video is a work of art by two incredibly talented individuals living on two different hemispheres! I connected with Ignacio Lidejover of Puerto-C Films in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Together, we wrote the video script. Then, I connected with Dietrich Wilke of Full Frame Media to do the videography work for the film. Dietrich is a fellow Minnesotan, and together we spent two days capturing footage for the campaign video. By the power of the Internet, the three of us worked together, and Ignacio produced the most beautiful video as the focal point of the campaign. 
 

We appreciate every bit of your support and want to thank you for taking the time to learn more about this significant project. We look forward to sharing this book and the stories of our Big Shared World with you!

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>The First Generation</i> has insights from children of Serbian, Filipino, Peruvian, Vietnamese, and Chinese immigrants, and it helps us realize that our problems do not discriminate. These mental health problems are common in all cultures, which is why we need to make it not only acceptable but normal to talk about our mental wellness.<br/><br/>My name is <strong>Eileen Stremming</strong> and I am the author of <i>The First Generation</i>. I wrote this book because it is so important for us to talk about mental health and it should not be stigmatized. Let’s talk about mental health like we can our physical health. </p>
<p><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that it is up to you to hold yourself accountable to help break down mental health stigma, as well as learn that mental illness does not have to debilitate you. Reframing the conversations around mental health so that they are a normal part of any discussion starts right here. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for normalizing mental health in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you find that it is completely okay to talk about mental health.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn why it's harder to talk about mental health for first-generation children and how important a support system is in order to help yourself and eventually others.</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll hear about the story of Jady, who found that you are not alone in your journey. Your support system can be the one that you were born with.</li>
<li>The story of Ena, who found that listening to the people who have your genuine well-being at heart makes it easier to get out of your head.</li>
<li>The story of Jane who, despite her family’s judgments, decided that she needed to get help — and realized that she is the only one who can call the shots in her life. You’ll see that you can take responsibility for your own life and health too.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are passionate about normalizing mental health assistance and learning about stories from people on their mental health journeys.</p>

<h3>The Book - The First Generation</h3>This book is written in 5 Parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction and why it’s harder for children of immigrants to navigate the conversation surrounding mental health journeys.

In this section, I share my own personal story with mental health as well as my little sister’s experience with the same problems, and the story of Justin Nguyen and his experiences with mental health.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 4, 5, and 6. This part helps us recognize the signs of common mental illnesses. It's important to educate ourselves, advocate for our friends with mental health problems, and help prevent suicides. It’s up to us to hold ourselves accountable in normalizing conversations surrounding mental health.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 7, 8, and 9. In this section, stories are shared from children of immigrants discussing the importance of creating a support system and simply finding somewhere they feel safe discussing their problems.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains Chapters 10 and 11. This part delves into trying to do something when your mental health seems to be faltering and kicking your butt. It will include stories from people who finally took responsibility into their own hands to better their mental health.<br/><br/>Part 5 contains Chapters 12, 13, and 14. In this section, I will share stories from people who are trying to help break down the stigma and how they are just doing that, as well as advice from mental health professionals on how to do so.<br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2> This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<p><strong>Eileen Stremming</strong> is an aspiring psychology trailblazer and Patient Care Coordinator intern at Agape Therapy Institute where she gets to see the ropes of how a practice works. She hopes that this can be the beginning of making an impact in the world of mental health.<br/><br/>She wrote this book because she’s tired of people seeing mental illness as “less than” a physical illness. Just because you cannot see a mental illness does not mean it is not real — and that’s why conversations around mental health need to happen. She is passionate about normalizing the idea of therapy as if it was as simple as going to the doctor’s office.<br/><br/>Eileen’s cats, Katherine and Hamilton, would say she’s a pretty good mommy — she spends hours baking her life away when she’s stressed, gives THE BEST cuddles, and is the most lovingest mom they could have ever wished for.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Eileen at eileenrenee07@gmail.com and eileenrenee_ on Instagram.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Una niña de mi edad</strong> es la historia de dos chicas: Alegra y Gladys, que una vez se encuentran emprenden una serie de aventuras de menor a mayor grado.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Alegra lleva un sol interior, una luz manifiesta en sus acciones, que crece para salvar a su amiga de la oscuridad. Esta fuerza concentrada la lleva a descubrir una serie de circunstancias adversas a Gladys, a quien ilumina, día tras día, con fervor, hasta convertirla en una lectora apasionada. Como una heroína, Alegra asciende con su compañera a sublimes alturas. Descubre un túnel oculto en el sótano de la casa de los Gasparotto e inicia junto a Gladys un viaje en el tiempo, que revela valor y pasión por el conocimiento.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia</strong> es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy se nos presenta <strong>Beatriz Pineda Sansone</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nací en la ciudad de Maracaibo, Venezuela, una tierra ardiente llena de luz. De niña era inquieta, llena de arrojo. Admiraba a nuestro Arturo Uslar Pietri cuando conducía su programa televisivo <i>Valores Humanos</i>. Su huella imborrable ha sido mi norte. Mi mayor encanto siempre han sido los niños con su arco iris de inocencia, su sencillez y su corazón floreciente. Cuando tuve los veintidós años, contraje matrimonio con Marcos Sansone, el compañero de mi vida. Tuve cuatro hijas maravillosas, que han extendido el fuego que llevo dentro a otros confines. Gracias a ellas he realizado grandes aventuras a favor de los niños.<br/>          Creé el Taller Literario Infantil Manzanita que devino en Fundación en 1985. Más tarde, con motivo del nacimiento de un nuevo diario en Maracaibo, fundé <i>Azulejo</i>, el periódico de los niños del diario La Verdad —primera etapa—. Extendí el Programa <i>La Hora del Cuento</i> a centros de arte, museos, universidades, colegios y McDonald’s de la ciudad con el fin de cultivar en los niños el amor por la lectura, y todas sus destrezas cognitivas, afectivas y psicomotoras. He luchado con pasión por convertir a los niños en emperadores de la palabra. Más tarde, en 1996, obtuve el título en Filología Hispánica con el premio <i>Summa Cum Laude</i> en la mención Investigación y Crítica de la Universidad del Zulia.<br/>          Cursé estudios de postgrado (2000-2003), y publiqué mis primeros escritos en la misma institución: <i>Las memorias del maestro Ramiro</i> (1979); <i>Desde otro rayo</i> (1992); <i>Cosmogonía en la obra de Ramón Palomares. Revista de Literatura Hispanoamericana No. 36</i> (1998). Me convertí en articulista de los diarios venezolanos <i>Economía hoy</i> y <i>El Universal</i>. Luego comencé a viajar con mi familia. He vivido en los Estados Unidos, Italia y España. En España he publicado: <i>Los ojos de la montaña</i> (2011),<i> La Hora del Cuento. Enseñar a razonar a los niños a través de la lectura de cuentos</i> (2015), y <i>El Principito y los Ideales. Defensa de la libertad, del amor y del razonamiento</i> (2017).<br/>          He recibido premios y reconocimientos a lo largo del camino, que me han regalado una gran satisfacción. Un relato de mi autoría titulado «Un extraño visitante» ha sido homenajeado recientemente por promover los valores a través de la lectura por la Fundación editorial el Perro y la Rana de Venezuela (2018). Estoy afiliada al Grupo de Estudios Peirceanos de la Universidad de Navarra.</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Un día, después del almuerzo, mientras Gladys tendía la ropa de los niños en las cuerdas del patio, yo observaba con curiosidad que había un marcado desnivel en el terreno donde se encontraba la casa de los Gasparotto, de forma que la cocina, el último cuarto y las áreas del servicio se elevaban del terreno a más de un metro, así que había que subir por unas escaleras como de seis o siete peldaños para llegar hasta ellas.<br/>          Le comenté a Gladys que en Italia, la mayoría de las casas tenían desnivel, porque había sótano. Pero acá era muy poco común, y, sin darme cuenta, me vi persiguiendo una pista que me indicara que, efectivamente, había subterráneo. Y, en efecto, en el lugar menos esperado comenzamos a notar que la pintura estaba agrietada formando un cuadrado perfecto.<br/>          Enseguida fuimos por una espátula y un cuchillo y con cuidado comenzamos a abrir la fisura. Pero, cuál fue nuestra sorpresa al percibir que un pedazo de pared se desprendió con facilidad, porque se trataba de una capa delgadita de cemento, así que continuamos levantándola, siempre guiadas por la grieta que aparecía en la pared, y otros pedazos comenzaron a caer, dejando al descubierto la superficie de madera de una pequeña puerta por donde una persona adulta doblada podía entrar. La empujamos con fuerza y ella cedió. Apareció, entonces, ante nosotros una boca oscura que nos causó sobresalto. Pero no entramos, aquel escenario inspiraba sospecha, temor. Se me ocurrió ir corriendo a casa en busca de dos linternas y un palo de escoba.<br/>          —A lo mejor nos tropezamos con un depósito de vino o con un tesoro —dije.<br/>          Armadas con el palo de escoba y las dos linternas, iluminamos el recinto desde afuera, y nuestro asombro creció cuando notamos la presencia de una escalera como de dos metros que descendía más aún. Decidimos entrar con mucho cuidado, pues pensamos que allí se podía ocultar cualquier tipo de bicho.<br/>          Con las dos linternas pudimos iluminar aquel espacio oculto que no recibía luz por ninguna otra parte. Y comenzamos a descender, caminábamos con suma precaución apartando telas de araña. Aquél era un espacio grande como el de una habitación.»</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
<li>Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.</li>
</ul>
<p>Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de <i>Una niña de mi edad</i> que saldría después a la venta.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><u>Aviso para navegantes</u>: La opción RESPALDAR es únicamente para realizar donaciones a la edición, por lo que no habrá comunicaciones posteriores en busca de datos de envío... cualquiera de las opciones válidas de reserva exige cumplimentar formulario para poder servir el pedido.</i></p>
<h3>Además...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona a la autora, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y <strong>Beatriz PIneda Sansone</strong> vea publicada su obra.</p>
<p>Gracias por vuestro tiempo.</p>

Una niña de mi edad es la historia de dos chicas: Alegra y Gladys, que una vez se encuentran emprenden una serie de aventuras de menor a mayor grado.
Alegra lleva un sol interior, una luz manifiesta en sus acciones, que crece para salvar a su amiga de la oscuridad. Esta fuerza concentrada la lleva a descubrir una serie de circunstancias adversas a Gladys, a quien ilumina, día tras día, con fervor, hasta convertirla en una lectora apasionada. Como una heroína, Alegra asciende con su compañera a sublimes alturas. Descubre un túnel oculto en el sótano de la casa de los Gasparotto e inicia junto a Gladys un viaje en el tiempo, que revela valor y pasión por el conocimiento.
¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.
De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy se nos presenta Beatriz Pineda Sansone.
Nací en la ciudad de Maracaibo, Venezuela, una tierra ardiente llena de luz. De niña era inquieta, llena de arrojo. Admiraba a nuestro Arturo Uslar Pietri cuando conducía su programa televisivo Valores Humanos. Su huella imborrable ha sido mi norte. Mi mayor encanto siempre han sido los niños con su arco iris de inocencia, su sencillez y su corazón floreciente. Cuando tuve los veintidós años, contraje matrimonio con Marcos Sansone, el compañero de mi vida. Tuve cuatro hijas maravillosas, que han extendido el fuego que llevo dentro a otros confines. Gracias a ellas he realizado grandes aventuras a favor de los niños.          Creé el Taller Literario Infantil Manzanita que devino en Fundación en 1985. Más tarde, con motivo del nacimiento de un nuevo diario en Maracaibo, fundé Azulejo, el periódico de los niños del diario La Verdad —primera etapa—. Extendí el Programa La Hora del Cuento a centros de arte, museos, universidades, colegios y McDonald’s de la ciudad con el fin de cultivar en los niños el amor por la lectura, y todas sus destrezas cognitivas, afectivas y psicomotoras. He luchado con pasión por convertir a los niños en emperadores de la palabra. Más tarde, en 1996, obtuve el título en Filología Hispánica con el premio Summa Cum Laude en la mención Investigación y Crítica de la Universidad del Zulia.          Cursé estudios de postgrado (2000-2003), y publiqué mis primeros escritos en la misma institución: Las memorias del maestro Ramiro (1979); Desde otro rayo (1992); Cosmogonía en la obra de Ramón Palomares. Revista de Literatura Hispanoamericana No. 36 (1998). Me convertí en articulista de los diarios venezolanos Economía hoy y El Universal. Luego comencé a viajar con mi familia. He vivido en los Estados Unidos, Italia y España. En España he publicado: Los ojos de la montaña (2011), La Hora del Cuento. Enseñar a razonar a los niños a través de la lectura de cuentos (2015), y El Principito y los Ideales. Defensa de la libertad, del amor y del razonamiento (2017).          He recibido premios y reconocimientos a lo largo del camino, que me han regalado una gran satisfacción. Un relato de mi autoría titulado «Un extraño visitante» ha sido homenajeado recientemente por promover los valores a través de la lectura por la Fundación editorial el Perro y la Rana de Venezuela (2018). Estoy afiliada al Grupo de Estudios Peirceanos de la Universidad de Navarra.
¿Por qué?
Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:
«Un día, después del almuerzo, mientras Gladys tendía la ropa de los niños en las cuerdas del patio, yo observaba con curiosidad que había un marcado desnivel en el terreno donde se encontraba la casa de los Gasparotto, de forma que la cocina, el último cuarto y las áreas del servicio se elevaban del terreno a más de un metro, así que había que subir por unas escaleras como de seis o siete peldaños para llegar hasta ellas.          Le comenté a Gladys que en Italia, la mayoría de las casas tenían desnivel, porque había sótano. Pero acá era muy poco común, y, sin darme cuenta, me vi persiguiendo una pista que me indicara que, efectivamente, había subterráneo. Y, en efecto, en el lugar menos esperado comenzamos a notar que la pintura estaba agrietada formando un cuadrado perfecto.          Enseguida fuimos por una espátula y un cuchillo y con cuidado comenzamos a abrir la fisura. Pero, cuál fue nuestra sorpresa al percibir que un pedazo de pared se desprendió con facilidad, porque se trataba de una capa delgadita de cemento, así que continuamos levantándola, siempre guiadas por la grieta que aparecía en la pared, y otros pedazos comenzaron a caer, dejando al descubierto la superficie de madera de una pequeña puerta por donde una persona adulta doblada podía entrar. La empujamos con fuerza y ella cedió. Apareció, entonces, ante nosotros una boca oscura que nos causó sobresalto. Pero no entramos, aquel escenario inspiraba sospecha, temor. Se me ocurrió ir corriendo a casa en busca de dos linternas y un palo de escoba.          —A lo mejor nos tropezamos con un depósito de vino o con un tesoro —dije.          Armadas con el palo de escoba y las dos linternas, iluminamos el recinto desde afuera, y nuestro asombro creció cuando notamos la presencia de una escalera como de dos metros que descendía más aún. Decidimos entrar con mucho cuidado, pues pensamos que allí se podía ocultar cualquier tipo de bicho.          Con las dos linternas pudimos iluminar aquel espacio oculto que no recibía luz por ninguna otra parte. Y comenzamos a descender, caminábamos con suma precaución apartando telas de araña. Aquél era un espacio grande como el de una habitación.»
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de Una niña de mi edad que saldría después a la venta.
Aviso para navegantes: La opción RESPALDAR es únicamente para realizar donaciones a la edición, por lo que no habrá comunicaciones posteriores en busca de datos de envío... cualquiera de las opciones válidas de reserva exige cumplimentar formulario para poder servir el pedido.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona a la autora, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Beatriz PIneda Sansone vea publicada su obra.
Gracias por vuestro tiempo.

<h3>Does life often seem harder than it should? </h3>
<p>Do other people seem to succeed faster than you? </p>
<p>Do their lives seem easier, less stressful and more glamorous, too? </p>
<p>Have you ever wondered to yourself…<i>why</i>?!</p>
<p><strong>My name is Eugene Vassilas and I am the author of <i>The F*ck Yes Life.</i> </strong></p>
<p>After writing my first book, <i>The Rebel’s Bible</i> —a guide to developing inner strength— I discovered how many well-intentioned people get secretly trapped by their “struggle” mindset. </p>
<p>While chasing a better life, it becomes '<i>hard work'</i> and '<i>long hours'</i> and '<i>life's hard'</i> all the way.</p>
<p>If any of this sounds familiar, don’t worry. It’s not your fault;</p>
<p>You’ve been unwittingly conditioned to think and live this way by society and other people.</p>
<p>But with <i>The F*ck Yes Life</i>, I'm going to help you make<i> hustle, stress &amp; fear-based living</i> a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Not to mention, you're going to love the powerful mindsets, stories and lessons that will stick with you a lifetime. </p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you’ll discover how accessible your “dream life“— whatever that means to you— really is —without all the “hustling” and  “grinding”.</p>
<p>(If this sound’s crazy, then you definitely need to get this book.)</p>
<p>I'm going to show you how to create a life that is fun, productive, and flows — no matter what yours looks like at the moment.</p>
<p>My hope is that I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for personal growth. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you create your own better world, and bring it to life.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>This is a book about mindset transformation and personal evolution. </strong></h3>
<p><strong>You'll read stories such as:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How many stress-driven working cultures prey on your insecurities — and how to recognize it and stop being exploited because of your dreams of success. </li>
<li>How Justin Faerman, Co-Founder of the Flow Consciousness Institute, left his soul-crushing career despite his fear and shifted into a life more in alignment with his passions and dreams as a visionary entrepreneur and wisdom teacher.</li>
<li>How J.D. Bradley, notorious street fighter turned book author — honed his hard-earned lessons from the street into insights on how to remain a badass without fighting and getting what he wanted in life.</li>
<li>What 300 Warriors from Ancient Sparta can teach us about mindset and getting things done in 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>You'll love this book if you:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Find yourself struggling at work or home, constantly pushing yourself but spinning your wheels and wondering why!</li>
<li>Want to see how the most successful are able to balance hard work and play </li>
<li>Are ready for a high-status communication protocol that’s powerful, purposeful and gets your needs met every time </li>
</ul>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The F*ck Yes Life</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to ambitious creatives who are open to looking at success and lifestyle design in a new way.</p>
<p>You might be a business person, lawyer, engineer— or someone who is simply tired of being bullied by never-ending life’s to-dos. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>This book is divided into four parts: </strong></h3>
</div>
</div><div>
<p>In <strong>MINDSET</strong>, you’ll learn the the principles of living a no-limits life. You’ll be introduced to the mature, powerful badass you already have within, but who may be in hiding. Even so, you’ll start to realize what’s possible for the next version of you— and how to bring that person to life. </p>
<p>In <strong>HEARTSET</strong>, we’ll focus on emotions, people and connection. After all, this transition requires an empathy overhaul. You’ll learn how to release judgements, conceit, and your so-called “inadequacies” so you can show up as a powerhouse for yourself and others. You’ll connect deeper and feel more satisfied more often as a result.</p>
<p>In <strong>BODYSET</strong>, we’ll focus on behavior and action. We’ll focus on getting this empowered mindset into your muscle memory, so you can own it. That way, you can still get stuff done, but stay relaxed and balanced while doing it. This section is also going to prove how pointless the ""go 110% all the time"" strategy is. Instead, you’ll learn how to start doing the right things in the right way, for more grace and ease.</p>
<p>In <strong>FUTURESET</strong>, you’ll learn how to get out of bed excited each day, and the tools to deal with any challenges which may pop up on the way to the life of your dreams.<br/> </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BTW: If you <strong>support <i>The F*ck Yes Life</i></strong> and want more confidence-packed content, choose the Perk option <strong>Rebel Confidence Coaching Program. </strong> This is my 8-week, become-a-badass, live online group process, that starts late Feb.

<p>I want to self publish a picture book called, ""I Just LOOK Different,"" for children born with facial deformities so that they know they are not alone, and to foster understanding in hopes of reducing, if not stopping, bullying of those children.</p>
<p>Here is my story.</p>
<p>The little girl in the picture is me, around 4 years old.</p>
<p>My twin sister and I were both born with a bilateral cleft lip and palate. It was a surprise to both of my parents. But we were lucky in many respects. Our dad was in the Air Force, so the numerous medical procedures, which started at 3 months old, were covered by insurance. But more importantly, my sister and I were lucky in that we had each other. We had someone with us at all times that knew what we were going through, someone to talk to, share our fears with, and ultimately commiserate when the teasing began. That teasing and taunting followed us in to adulthood, when it finally stopped. It's been a weird blessing, though I wouldn't wish it on anyone.</p>
<p>It was during one of my shifts as a radiology technologist when the idea of the book came to me. I had to do a chest x-ray on an inpatient at the hospital where I was working. But when I went to get the patient, I was greeted by the stunning site of a person with no face. This patient had tried to commit suicide with a gun shot under the chin but had failed. The patient was alert, but horribly disfigured and blind for life. I didn't know what had prompted this person to get to that point, but I knew they would be in for what would probably be a lifetime of stares and whispers about how they looked.</p>
<div>
<h3>Who this book is for</h3>
<p>All I could think about for hours afterwards was what I had endured growing up, and what children all over born with facial defects were dealing with every day as far as the teasing and bullying. I researched to see if there were any books that are actually meant to help children with facial deformities deal with adversity, and there are very few. So I went to the cafeteria during my lunch break and wrote the book. I called it, ""I Just Look Different."" But I wasn't comfortable sending it off to a publisher, to be changed and altered. It was my story. It was me.</p>
<p> When I was younger, bullying was much more personal and direct when the cruel names and taunts were said directly to my face. Everyone knows that in this day and age, bullying has gone to extremes with all of the technology that is out there. Kids need as much support as they can get in dealing with the verbal attacks that come at them from so many places, and which seem to unfortunately be so common place these days. This point was brought home to me after I appeared on America's Got Talent.</p>
<p>I love singing and auditioned for America's Got Talent a few years ago. I made it to Las Vegas before I was cut, but because of those brief few minutes I had been given on T.V, I received hundreds of emails from people born with all types of facial defects, their parents, siblings, and friends, thanking me for putting myself out there and putting a face on something that nobody really talks about. I wanted to publish it after reading them, but still couldn't afford to do so. Now, hopefully with your help, I can.</p>
<p>This book is very personal. It chronicles some of the things I dealt with when I was very young. <strong>It is for the children out there like me. </strong>They need to know that there are other kids out there like them who have gone through what they are going through every day. Hopefully, the book will also educate those kids who may think it's okay to say hurtful things to other kids, especially for reasons beyond their control. This book is for ALL of them.</p>
<p><strong>THE COST AND BENEFITS</strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I am self-publishing this book so I can make every decision regarding its printing and publication and offer non-profit organizations reduced retail pricing. The publishing package and the initial printing which of 1000 copies to keep the retail price down will cost $4000. Any money after that will be needed to pay for the illustrations for the book. <strong>Part of the profits at the end</strong> <strong>of the year will go to</strong> <strong>Ameriface, Operation Smile, and the Smile Train</strong>, <strong>all national organization that offer information and support to families with children born with facial defects</strong>. I am hoping to find an artist willing to do the art work at a reduced rate due to the nature of this book.</p>
<p>I am dedicated to seeing this through, so if the funds aren't raised this time around, I will do what I can with the money raised to get it started, then fund raise again until I make my goal. There are multiple perks being offered as an incentive to donate.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you so much for your support!</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Know any organizations that help kids with facial defects, or doctor's offices, clinics? Please let them know about this project to help get the word out! Any clinics or non-profit organizations will get a deeply reduced price for any books they order when they order directly from me! </p>

Our dad was in the Air Force, so the numerous medical procedures, which started at 3 months old, were covered by insurance. But more importantly, my sister and I were lucky in that we had each other. We had someone with us at all times that knew what we were going through, someone to talk to, share our fears with, and ultimately commiserate when the teasing began. That teasing and taunting followed us in to adulthood, when it finally stopped. It's been a weird blessing, though I wouldn't wish it on anyone.
It was during one of my shifts as a radiology technologist when the idea of the book came to me. I had to do a chest x-ray on an inpatient at the hospital where I was working. But when I went to get the patient, I was greeted by the stunning site of a person with no face. This patient had tried to commit suicide with a gun shot under the chin but had failed. The patient was alert, but horribly disfigured and blind for life. I didn't know what had prompted this person to get to that point, but I knew they would be in for what would probably be a lifetime of stares and whispers about how they looked.

Who this book is for
All I could think about for hours afterwards was what I had endured growing up, and what children all over born with facial defects were dealing with every day as far as the teasing and bullying. I researched to see if there were any books that are actually meant to help children with facial deformities deal with adversity, and there are very few. So I went to the cafeteria during my lunch break and wrote the book. I called it, ""I Just Look Different."" But I wasn't comfortable sending it off to a publisher, to be changed and altered. It was my story. It was me.
 When I was younger, bullying was much more personal and direct when the cruel names and taunts were said directly to my face. Everyone knows that in this day and age, bullying has gone to extremes with all of the technology that is out there. Kids need as much support as they can get in dealing with the verbal attacks that come at them from so many places, and which seem to unfortunately be so common place these days. This point was brought home to me after I appeared on America's Got Talent.
I love singing and auditioned for America's Got Talent a few years ago. I made it to Las Vegas before I was cut, but because of those brief few minutes I had been given on T.V, I received hundreds of emails from people born with all types of facial defects, their parents, siblings, and friends, thanking me for putting myself out there and putting a face on something that nobody really talks about. I wanted to publish it after reading them, but still couldn't afford to do so. Now, hopefully with your help, I can.
This book is very personal. It chronicles some of the things I dealt with when I was very young. It is for the children out there like me. They need to know that there are other kids out there like them who have gone through what they are going through every day. Hopefully, the book will also educate those kids who may think it's okay to say hurtful things to other kids, especially for reasons beyond their control. This book is for ALL of them.
THE COST AND BENEFITS


I am self-publishing this book so I can make every decision regarding its printing and publication and offer non-profit organizations reduced retail pricing. The publishing package and the initial printing which of 1000 copies to keep the retail price down will cost $4000. Any money after that will be needed to pay for the illustrations for the book. Part of the profits at the end of the year will go to Ameriface, Operation Smile, and the Smile Train, all national organization that offer information and support to families with children born with facial defects. I am hoping to find an artist willing to do the art work at a reduced rate due to the nature of this book.
I am dedicated to seeing this through, so if the funds aren't raised this time around, I will do what I can with the money raised to get it started, then fund raise again until I make my goal. There are multiple perks being offered as an incentive to donate.
Thank you so much for your support!


Other Ways You Can Help
Know any organizations that help kids with facial defects, or doctor's offices, clinics? Please let them know about this project to help get the word out! Any clinics or non-profit organizations will get a deeply reduced price for any books they order when they order directly from me!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>This is the true story of a young rabbi who quits the pulpit to travel the world. Rabbi Ben lays out a five year plan to climb the highest mountains, scuba dive with sharks, and see some of the world’s most impressive sites.</p>
<p>On his journey Ben hopes to discover and explore all the world has to offer. His beliefs as a person, as a spiritual leader, and as a religious Jew will be challenged as new situations constantly arise. Now it is time to see what he truly believes in.</p>
<p>‘God is in My Backpack’ follows the first year of Ben’s travels from Australia to Canada, Central and South America, Europe, and India. He shares his personal journey as he discovers a deeper connection with the world at large, and with G-d.</p>
<p>It was not always easy for Ben, as he writes in the book...</p>
<p><em>A movie was playing on the in-flight screen. I didn’t find it interesting but kept watching anyway. It gave me a way to distract myself from all my nagging thoughts and rising anxiety. So many things came to mind: Could I really travel for the next five years? What if I got bored? Maybe after a while everything would become uninteresting. Seeing a waterfall, a museum, or a monument would just make me say, ‘Yeah, whatever it’s just another waterfall!’ </em></p>
<p><em>And what about money?  Would I have enough? What if I ran out? Maybe things would cost more than I planned? Would this mean I’d need to stop and get a job at some point?</em></p>
<p><em>Would I always be able to find food to fit my kosher dietary needs? Could I really survive on mostly fruit, nuts, vegetables, rice, and eggs? I guess I could? I read that if you ate only avocados you could live for a year… but yuck… I didn’t want to eat only avocados for one year.</em></p>
<p><em>And could I run away from who I was? I was a rabbi and cantor, – who would I be now? What would my label be? Don’t we all need labels? Don’t we all need to be able to say, “Hi, I’m John. I am an accountant,” or, “I’m Sally and I’m a nurse.”</em></p>
<p><em>What was I going to say? I was giving up my identity that I spent the last few years creating. Perhaps I could just be ‘Ben.’ That’s it. ‘Ben,’ nothing more, nothing less… well, maybe a bit more.  I could give my full name, ‘Binyamin.’ This could give me an identity boost. ‘Binyamin,’ in the Bible was the youngest son of Jacob. This was perhaps better than plain ‘Ben.’ But maybe it would be good to lose my identity completely and create a whole new one?</em></p>

<h1><strong>Here is a Sample from the Book:</strong></h1>
<p>(Please note: photos won't necessarily be in the book, and things may change slightly after editing<strong>)</strong></p>
<p><em>Along with journal entries, I had other writing to do. I had to fill out postcards to send to family and friends. Most importantly was a weekly card to Grandma. She loved to get the cards and to hear about what I was up to. I couldn’t always tell her the truth, though; some things would make her too nervous. It was important to make her a bit worried, but not too much. Grandma’s job – like any good Jewish grandmother – was to worry about her children and grandchildren. I had to do my share and give her something to worry about, but not, G-d forbid, enough to give her a heart attack.</em></p>
<p><em>So, what do I tell Grandma?</em></p>
<p><em>I should probably not mention the volcano I climbed this week – yes, the one with the flowing lava – the one where we hiked along a red stream of hot, molten rock. It had been flowing one foot away from me and I could feel the rising heat. The rock was sharp and jagged. One guy slipped and cut his hand and backpack. He probably needed some stitches.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/285/639/7028b0b2393d2784a8ad7efb813b1b00_large.jpg?1354239075"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><em>This is not a story to tell Grandma. Because it’s not even something she can share with her friends when they sit around drinking tea and kvetching. If she starts telling them how worried she is about her grandson, the Rabbi, who is now climbing active volcanoes, her friends may think she’s started to lose her mind.</em></p>
<p><em>Instead, I will talk about the weather, the food, and the people. But how boring! I don’t want to write about this. However, it is something she could worry about and share with her friends.</em></p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/018/212/ab302a74174990c6d1a675571ec3f483_large.JPG?1338944092"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><em>“Oy, I tell you, my grandson, the Rabbi,” I could hear Grandma saying. “I don’t know what he’s doing in Guatemala, where’s he supposed to get a job in Guatemala; how many Jews and synagogues do you think there are in Guatemala? And look at this card he sends me – he says it was very cold, so he went to the market and bought a jacket for five dollars…How warm is a  five-dollar jacket supposed to keep him! I hope he doesn’t get sick, G-d forbid…”</em></p>
<p><em>This could work, I thought; but, I’d spoken about the weather in the last card.</em></p>
<p><em>I could tell her about my three days soaking in the hot thermal bath in the mountains. I should probably leave out the part that I was the only one there – well, at least during the night and early morning, when everyone was gone. People came up during the day. But there are a few small cabins to stay in overnight, which are expensive for local people, but with American dollars, it wasn’t much. Early in the mornings, I would soak in the pools, surrounded by lush, green hills. As the sun rose and the clouds lifted, it looked like something from a prehistoric world. It made me think of the movie Jurassic Park that I saw as a kid. A misty jungle. I was almost waiting for a dinosaur to appear.</em></p>
<p><em>At night, I lit a wood fire in my small, cozy cabin. I could sit and think. It was one of the most peaceful places I’d ever been to. I like these opportunities because when I’m alone, I can meditate and work on my connection with G-d.</em></p>

<p><em>But this is too much; it won’t fit on one postcard.</em></p>
<p><em>I could write smaller, but Grandma won’t be able to read it.</em></p>
<p><em>Hmmmm…</em></p>

<p><em>“Grandma, Guatemala is not India…Yes, I know it is a third-world country, but…Okay, I promise to be careful what I eat. Anyway, I’m eating mostly fruits and vegetables…Yes, Grandma, I’m peeling everything, and I’m not drinking the local water, only purified, bottled water.”</em></p>
<p><em>We’d had this conversation already – was it three times or four? I can’t remember. Oh, that’s another thing – should you actually trust the bottled water. I’ve heard there have been some scams where people re-bottle tap water to sell to tourists.</em></p>

<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Jorge’s mother stoked the fire while Pablo looked around, scanning the village, from house to house. He seemed deeply lost in thought.</em></p>
<p><em>“We find you wife from village. A good Guatemala woman who cook for you, no?”</em></p>
<p><em>“No, thank you,” I replied; “not interested.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Why not?” Pablo pressed. “You marry good girl, you live in village, have many kids, learn Spanish, have a nice farm, some chickens, a few pigs, we have good church you can come to.”</em></p>
<p><em>“No, thank you,” I repeated. “It is very thoughtful of you, but I’ve got other things to do with my life.”</em></p>
<p><em>Pablo shrugged and said, “Fine, I will teach you some traditional dancing in case you change your mind. If you marry here, you need to dance at wedding.”</em></p>
<p><em>I was a Rabbi, or at least an ex-rabbi, I thought. I spent plenty of time dancing at Jewish weddings, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, and Israel celebrations. Well, that is if you can call what we did dancing – i.e., the hora, the traditional Jewish dance.</em></p>
<p><em>Pablo demonstrated his people’s traditional way of how to approach a girl on the dance floor. “Step like this, bow like this, put out your hand…” I guess it worked well if you were dancing at a local village festival. If I tried these steps anywhere else in the world, people would either think I was drunk or doing some comedy routine. My six-year-old dancing partner, Pablo’s daughter, laughed as I did the approach.</em></p>
<p><em>Then, it was my turn to show him my traditional dance. I wanted to demonstrate some hora or Chassidic dance steps, though I could not think of any. Chassidic dancing, which is what I grew up with, is mainly running around in a circle while holding hands or clapping. It’s kind of a like doing a hora, only with less rhythm and coordination, and applying more speed.</em></p>
<p><em>I explained how, in Chassidic dancing, if you try and dance with any beat or rhythm, you will be bumped into and pushed out of the circle. The family could not understand how my type of traditional dancing had no steps and no rhythm. “You need to just run around in a circle very quickly and go crazy. Like this…” I kept demonstrating.</em></p>
<p><em>They probably thought I was crazy. The family had a good laugh at my antics, as did the half-dozen local village kids who had gathered by the door. They had enjoyed watching the hapless foreigner trying to dance to their music, and now, demonstrating his own traditional dances. They were very helpful, though, and I had an endless source of six-year-old dancing partners to laugh at me.</em></p>

“No, thank you,” I replied; “not interested.”
“Why not?” Pablo pressed. “You marry good girl, you live in village, have many kids, learn Spanish, have a nice farm, some chickens, a few pigs, we have good church you can come to.”
“No, thank you,” I repeated. “It is very thoughtful of you, but I’ve got other things to do with my life.”
Pablo shrugged and said, “Fine, I will teach you some traditional dancing in case you change your mind. If you marry here, you need to dance at wedding.”
I was a Rabbi, or at least an ex-rabbi, I thought. I spent plenty of time dancing at Jewish weddings, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, and Israel celebrations. Well, that is if you can call what we did dancing – i.e., the hora, the traditional Jewish dance.
Pablo demonstrated his people’s traditional way of how to approach a girl on the dance floor. “Step like this, bow like this, put out your hand…” I guess it worked well if you were dancing at a local village festival. If I tried these steps anywhere else in the world, people would either think I was drunk or doing some comedy routine. My six-year-old dancing partner, Pablo’s daughter, laughed as I did the approach.
Then, it was my turn to show him my traditional dance. I wanted to demonstrate some hora or Chassidic dance steps, though I could not think of any. Chassidic dancing, which is what I grew up with, is mainly running around in a circle while holding hands or clapping. It’s kind of a like doing a hora, only with less rhythm and coordination, and applying more speed.
I explained how, in Chassidic dancing, if you try and dance with any beat or rhythm, you will be bumped into and pushed out of the circle. The family could not understand how my type of traditional dancing had no steps and no rhythm. “You need to just run around in a circle very quickly and go crazy. Like this…” I kept demonstrating.
They probably thought I was crazy. The family had a good laugh at my antics, as did the half-dozen local village kids who had gathered by the door. They had enjoyed watching the hapless foreigner trying to dance to their music, and now, demonstrating his own traditional dances. They were very helpful, though, and I had an endless source of six-year-old dancing partners to laugh at me.
 
Why This Project?

I have chosen to use the crowd-founding approach to help pay for the publication of this book. There are a number of costs such as, paying the editor, the proof reader, for the cover design and the actual printing of the book. Funds raised here will enable me to get the book published.

Thank you for reading this far and I hope you get a coppy and enjoy the book.

<h3>Why Get Involved?</h3>
<p>Over the past two years Sounds and Colours has earned a reputation as a worldwide champion of South American culture, with regular readers across Europe, North America, South America and Asia. We've always been committed to finding the most interesting stories and artists, and are at our happiest when unearthing a hidden gem. It's the same approach we are bringing to this edition.</p>
<p>When you buy a copy of Sounds and Colours in print, you help to cover the cost of printing a first edition book. This is a big undertaking. You are also supporting the writers in showcasing their talent, the independent Colombian artists with their artwork, and the creation of a wider audience for Colombian culture. Not to mention the fact that you will get book of passionately-written, well-researched book that you will want to keep for years.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.soundsandcolours.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Sounds and Colours"">Sounds and Colours</a> is a South American music and culture magazine. Up to now we've always been purely online, with this being our first venture into the physical world!</p>
<p>Our aim has always been to raise awareness of the amazing and diverse cultures of South America, promoting independent artists, groups and movements that rarely get the attention they deserve. This is something which we will continue doing in <em>Sounds and Colours Presents Colombia</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Are We Using Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>We have been planning this book for some time now, and could never quite work out how to make it happen. Trying to get advertisers takes a lot of time and diverts our energies away from actually writing about the things we love. It also creates situations where we have to feature certain content to please our sponsors.</p>
<p>By raising the funds through Crowdfunding it really feels like we are able to keep our DIY aesthetic, and will allow us to make the book that we want to make, and that you all will want to read.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Breakdown of Costs</h3>
<p>The breakdown of the costs are quite simple. Here they are:</p>
<p><strong>Cost of printing 1,000 books</strong>:<strong> </strong>$3,000</p>
<p><strong>Cost of producing 1,000 CDs</strong>: $1,000</p>
<p><strong>Payment for Commisioned Artwork &amp; Articles</strong>: $500</p>

I currently live in the Bay Area of California. My free time is typically spent by procrastinating and writing.<br/></span>The purpose of this campaign is to help fund entries for chapbook competitions. </p><p>A chapbook is a collection of short stories and/or poems (In my case, poems) that is smaller than a regular book; typically, a book will contain anywhere from fifty to one hundred pieces, while a chapbook may contain as little as ten to twenty. The purpose of a chapbook is to allow newer writers, such as myself, a foot in the door of the publishing world. Publishing a chapbook is significantly easier and enables newer writers to start creating collections without having to go through large press houses. Chapbooks are usually more intimate than books; they're often hand-stitched or bound, have a smaller print run, and often reside on the ""first frontier"", so to speak, of publishing.</p><p>Should you help this fundraiser in any way, you will be helping a new writer get his first collection published.

I currently live in the Bay Area of California. My free time is typically spent by procrastinating and writing.The purpose of this campaign is to help fund entries for chapbook competitions. A chapbook is a collection of short stories and/or poems (In my case, poems) that is smaller than a regular book; typically, a book will contain anywhere from fifty to one hundred pieces, while a chapbook may contain as little as ten to twenty. The purpose of a chapbook is to allow newer writers, such as myself, a foot in the door of the publishing world. Publishing a chapbook is significantly easier and enables newer writers to start creating collections without having to go through large press houses. Chapbooks are usually more intimate than books; they're often hand-stitched or bound, have a smaller print run, and often reside on the ""first frontier"", so to speak, of publishing.Should you help this fundraiser in any way, you will be helping a new writer get his first collection published. That's monumental in itself; it's difficult to make a splash in the near-boundless sea of writers. What I need and where it'll goThe funding goal is set to five hundred dollars. Most of this money will go towards submission fees for chapbook contests; a great deal of the larger chapbook contests require a small payment to help fund the contest and these payments can range from ten dollars up to fifty. A smaller portion will go towards covering the costs of the perks, however most of that will come from my own pocket.Should the goal not be reached, the funds will still go towards submission fees and the perks. Other Ways You Can HelpCan't donate?

Vary Baker, whose book <i>Me &amp; Lee</i> documents her intimate
relationship with Lee Harvey Oswald while they both lived and worked
in New Orleans on a cancer research project, will make her first
public appearance in New Orleans in over 10 years to mark the
birthday of her lover and explain why she believes Lee Harvey Oswald
was not the lone gunman who killed President John F. Kennedy.<br/><br/>Ms.
Baker will be the featured speaker at a one-day symposium sponsored
by Trineday Publishing and Stuart H. Smith at Loyola University’s
Miller Hall, Room 114 on Saturday, October 19, 9 a.m. to noon.
Other JFK researchers and authors will be featured.<br/><br/>Ms.
Baker, a girlfriend and lover of Lee Harvey Oswald in New Orleans
during the summer of 1963, has been living in exile in Europe for
almost a decade after receiving death threats and surviving several
accidents since going public with her story. Her book has been out
for three years and has garnered a strong following in the JFK
research community, according to Publisher Kris Millegan.<br/><br/>Accused assassin Lee
Harvey Oswald is the central figure in Ms. Baker’s true story of an
enthralling Cold War spy saga. Me and Lee documents how 23-year-old
Oswald was involved in an underground medical laboratory overseen by famed New Orleans Dr. Mary Sherman and employing a 20-year-old Judy to create
a bio-weapon capable of infecting and killing humans with cancer. The bio-weapon, which was tested on an Angola prisoner, was successfully
developed and to be smuggled into Cuba to use against Fidel
Castro. The goal: kill Castro in order to save John F. Kennedy's life by changing the focus of his enemies to invade a then-helpless Cuba. Baker also describes Lee Oswald’s roles in the CIA in the USSR and as a ""pro-Cuba"" activist in New Orleans so he would be trusted by the communists. Me &amp; Lee reveals for the first time many mysteries in Oswald's life, culminating with his abortive trip to Mexico City, his being ordered back to Dallas, and why he had to die after being framed in the Kennedy assassination. Readers typically say ""this book connects all the dots,"" praising Me &amp; Lee as ""the most sensible and logical explanation of the actions of the mysterious Oswald.""<br/><br/>After
studying her story and interviewing Judyth several times, Jim Marrs,
veteran JFK researcher and author of <i>Crossfire: The Plot that Killed
Kennedy</i> wrote: “Will anyone in the government finally tell the
public the truth about the Kennedy assassination? It is highly
unlikely. But can we ever really know the truth? I say yes, by studying
the wide array of information now available, thinking for ourselves,
and listening to the impassioned unflinching voice of Judyth Vary
Baker.”<br/><br/>Former
Governor Jesse Ventura calls Baker’s book “stunning” and ranked
it among his six favorite conspiracy reads, adding that, “her book
shows beyond any doubt that (Oswald) was clearly a government
agent.”<br/><br/>The
event is open to the public but registration is required. A $20
admission charge includes Ms. Baker’s book or another title from

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>SURVIVOR is my personal account of the cross-continental journey of many Haitian, African and Cuban migrants from 2015 to 2017. With the goal of entering the United States, we traversed through 10 countries by land, even having to walk across the dangerous Darien Gap Forest.

</div></div>","Short Summary
SURVIVOR is my personal account of the cross-continental journey of many Haitian, African and Cuban migrants from 2015 to 2017. With the goal of entering the United States, we traversed through 10 countries by land, even having to walk across the dangerous Darien Gap Forest. Some made it across to the US, others went on to enter Canada, and others, like me, stayed on the Mexican border in Tijuana and Mexicali. Unfortunately, many of them did not survive, and others were deported under the Obama and Trump administrations. I wrote this book to share my personal experience as a migrant, to keep register of our difficult journey brought on by unjust circumstances that cause us to migrate, and to commemorate the resistance and perseverance of everyone on their search for a better life.

Podemos tomarlo como un periodo de descanso, de intentar conocernos desde cero, de enfrentarnos a lo desconocido que se esconde dentro de cada uno de nosotros. Ahora no tenemos responsabilidades, no podemos trabajar, no podemos discutir con las personas que nos hacen enfadar, ni preocuparnos por problemas que ahora mismo nos son tan ajenos. Puede que alguno de nosotros tuviera una vida fácil, pero seguro que había preocupaciones y quebraderos de cabeza. Tenemos la posibilidad de pasear por lugares nuevos encima de nuestros propios pasos, observar el paisaje del que tantas veces habremos disfrutado y maravillarnos por primera vez. Podemos conocer a las personas de nuestra familia y considerarlos amigos, o quizás volver a enamorarnos del que juraba ser el amor de nuestra vida.<br/>          —Creo que a ti el accidente te ha dejado un poco loco —afirmó Susi.<br/>          —No…, puede que Tomás tenga una parte de razón. Aunque no puedo dejar de sentir miedo —reconoció Amelia.<br/>          —¿Razón? Creo que no me está ayudando demasiado hablar con vosotros…<br/>          —¿Y de qué quieres hablar?<br/>          —Del inspector. De que somos sospechosos de haber matado a un hombre, y ninguno de los tres recuerda nada. Puede que uno de nosotros sea un asesino.»</p>

<p>Hello everyone! We are overjoyed to announce that our second book <i>God is with Us</i> is now available for pre-sale of personalized, signed copies AND that we will be hosting a <i>God is with Us</i> meet and greet, book reading, and party complete with dancing in Sedona on October 27, 2018 in celebration of the new book and of course, of YOU! Tickets for this are limited, so please get yours early if you are ready and able to meet us in this sacred space. We are so thrilled to offer this and hope that many of you can come!</p>
<p>For those of you who may be new to our work, Hanan and I are a writing and creative team - married for 20 years and having gone deeper and deeper into sacred partnership throughout. Hanan is a highly ethical, heart-centered shaman whose work helps clients emerge from illness, overcome personal obstacles and tap into their sacred purpose; and I am a writer, speaker and embodiment of the divine feminine, working to inspire others daily through my writing. </p>
<p><i>God is with Us</i> is our second book, which details the story of how we uncovered a hidden shamanic lineage that holds potent secrets to vitality and divine union. This book, both tender and fierce, resurrects potent truths that were forced into hiding for thousands of years: known as the Essene tradition. This secret lineage—whose ways and practices are encoded in the Dead Sea Scrolls as well as within <i>us</i>—is a messianic, Goddess-honoring sect of Judaism who practiced shamanic divine union as the deepest form of personal atonement and communion with the Divine.</p>
<p><i>God is with Us</i> also tells the very real, miraculous stories of Hanan’s shamanic journeywork, which have helped people heal everything from addiction to broken relationships to cancer—and more. We outline five potent journeys, each with its own collective messages and themes, shedding vital light on how we may all use these practices to heal, restoring wholeness and energetic vitality that will last lifetimes. </p>
<p>This is also a wonderful volume for anyone who is simply curious about shamanism, the divine feminine, and/or divine union and wants to learn more from an ancient perspective.</p>
<p>In this campaign, we are offering a pre-sale of <i>God is with Us</i>, which is a limited time event as well as tickets to our epic celebration in Sedona on Saturday, October 27, 2018, in which we will all come together, socialize, eat, enjoy a reading of the book and Q&amp;A, and of course, DANCE!!! Proceeds from this will go directly to support our family as we relocate to the magical town of Sedona, as well as to support the development of EISEN, our new institute devoted to education on how ethical, heart-centered shamanism can revolutionize our treatment of illness (mental and physical) when used in loving partnership with conventional medicine. You can learn more about EISEN here: esseneshamanism.com.</p>
<p>WE ARE SO EXCITED and we hope that you are too. Thank you so much for supporting our work. Please feel free to contact us with any inquiries, and we’ll see you in Sedona!</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Unfiltered</i> is about how to combat misinformation using perspective journalism.<br/><br/>My name is Sudiksha Kochi and I am the author of <i>Unfiltered</i>. I wrote this book for two reasons. First, I am passionate about fighting misinformation. I had the opportunity to work at PolitiFact, a Pulitzer-Prize winning fact-checking organization, where I discovered just how dangerous misinformation can be. When an individual is exposed to falsehoods, they are forming a perception of reality that not only puts themselves at risk but puts others at risk too. We see it all the time, from the groups of anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers who believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is ""fake"" to the QAnon conspiracy theorists who continue to believe that the 2020 presidential election was a fraud. It is scary to think that misinformation can lure hundreds of people across the nation into its trap.<br/><br/>I also wrote this book because many people think of journalists as ""stenographers."" To put it simply, they think that journalists go to the White House or Capitol Hill, hear what politicians have to say about an issue, and then present those words to the public. Well, I am here to tell you that is not what journalists do! In fact, journalists challenge the power of elected officials, engage in their local communities, and report from an angle all the time. This side of journalism, however, is never fully exposed to the public.<br/><br/>My book is about perspective journalism, which is a concept that I branded after doing extensive research and interviews with journalists from a variety of different experiences and backgrounds. Perspective journalism combines the fundamentals of news reporting with the fundamentals of fact-checking. In this book, I introduce six principles of perspective journalism and offer strategies to help combat misinformation using those principles.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover more about what journalism is and, more importantly, use journalism to positively impact your life. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you fight misinformation on a daily basis and change your thinking about any news topic at hand.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Former NBC journalist and GoLike founder Mariana Atencio's experience covering three hurricanes, one earthquake, and a mass shooting at a Texas church. She conveys the idea of storytelling in journalism and how stories have to be told with ""raw emotion that really needs no translation.""</li>
<li>Independent journalist Jennifer Karchmer's time in Reykjavik, Iceland documenting freedom of the press as a volunteer for Reporters Without Borders.</li>
<li>Emmy-Award Winning NPR journalist Tonya Mosley's thoughts on rebuilding trust with local communities and the power of accountability in journalism.</li>
<li>Freelance journalist Alice Driver supported by the National Geographic Emergency Fund for Journalists documenting the experiences of families living in Latin America</li>
<li>PolitiFact founder and Knight Professor of the Practice of Journalism and Public Policy at Duke University Bill Adair's model on the continuum of journalism.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Unfiltered</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to anyone who wants to look at journalism and combating misinformation in a new way.</p>
<h3>The Book - <i>Unfiltered</i>
</h3>
<p>This book is divided into three parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1 - 3. In this section of the book, readers will learn the history behind misinformation, why the term ""fake news"" should not be used, Bill Adair's model on the continuum of journalism, the psychology behind misinformation, and the prevalence of misinformation in society today.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 4 - 9. In this section, readers will learn about the six principles of perspective journalism. Each chapter will feature 2-3 journalists whose experiences contribute to the foundation of each principle.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 10 - 12 + conclusion. In this section, readers will be offered strategies to help combat misinformation on a daily basis using the principles of perspective journalism.</p>

</div></div>","Story of My Book
Unfiltered is about how to combat misinformation using perspective journalism.My name is Sudiksha Kochi and I am the author of Unfiltered. I wrote this book for two reasons. First, I am passionate about fighting misinformation. I had the opportunity to work at PolitiFact, a Pulitzer-Prize winning fact-checking organization, where I discovered just how dangerous misinformation can be. When an individual is exposed to falsehoods, they are forming a perception of reality that not only puts themselves at risk but puts others at risk too. We see it all the time, from the groups of anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers who believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is ""fake"" to the QAnon conspiracy theorists who continue to believe that the 2020 presidential election was a fraud. It is scary to think that misinformation can lure hundreds of people across the nation into its trap.I also wrote this book because many people think of journalists as ""stenographers."" To put it simply, they think that journalists go to the White House or Capitol Hill, hear what politicians have to say about an issue, and then present those words to the public. Well, I am here to tell you that is not what journalists do! In fact, journalists challenge the power of elected officials, engage in their local communities, and report from an angle all the time. This side of journalism, however, is never fully exposed to the public.My book is about perspective journalism, which is a concept that I branded after doing extensive research and interviews with journalists from a variety of different experiences and backgrounds. Perspective journalism combines the fundamentals of news reporting with the fundamentals of fact-checking. In this book, I introduce six principles of perspective journalism and offer strategies to help combat misinformation using those principles.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover more about what journalism is and, more importantly, use journalism to positively impact your life. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you fight misinformation on a daily basis and change your thinking about any news topic at hand.
In this book, you'll hear stories such as...

Former NBC journalist and GoLike founder Mariana Atencio's experience covering three hurricanes, one earthquake, and a mass shooting at a Texas church. She conveys the idea of storytelling in journalism and how stories have to be told with ""raw emotion that really needs no translation.""
Independent journalist Jennifer Karchmer's time in Reykjavik, Iceland documenting freedom of the press as a volunteer for Reporters Without Borders.
Emmy-Award Winning NPR journalist Tonya Mosley's thoughts on rebuilding trust with local communities and the power of accountability in journalism.
Freelance journalist Alice Driver supported by the National Geographic Emergency Fund for Journalists documenting the experiences of families living in Latin America
PolitiFact founder and Knight Professor of the Practice of Journalism and Public Policy at Duke University Bill Adair's model on the continuum of journalism.

Unfiltered is a nonfiction book that speaks to anyone who wants to look at journalism and combating misinformation in a new way.
The Book - Unfiltered

This book is divided into three parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1 - 3. In this section of the book, readers will learn the history behind misinformation, why the term ""fake news"" should not be used, Bill Adair's model on the continuum of journalism, the psychology behind misinformation, and the prevalence of misinformation in society today.Part 2 contains chapters 4 - 9. In this section, readers will learn about the six principles of perspective journalism. Each chapter will feature 2-3 journalists whose experiences contribute to the foundation of each principle.Part 3 contains chapters 10 - 12 + conclusion. In this section, readers will be offered strategies to help combat misinformation on a daily basis using the principles of perspective journalism.

In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have about mental health.<br/><br/>As part of writing this book, I have had the incredible experience of meeting people from all walks of life and from across the globe.

I will move to any state in the US for $15,000, the cost of doing the entire trip. If an individual or corporation gives me $15,000, I will move to a state of their choice for Sept 2019-Sept 2020. I'll do community service 3x a week and be a part of the community. For $20,000, you can pick any city or town (except for Truth or Consequences, NM) 

What We Need & What You Get:
These are the expenses I'm dealing with on this trip.

25,000 miles worth of gas
occasional hotels/AirBnbs when I can't find hosts
interview equipment/meals for interviewees/gifts for hosts
car payments
marketing
food
flights back and forth from the UK


Why is this important?
We live in a very polarized country and I want to share a variety of opinions that exist in our excitingly diverse country. It's important for us to understand other perspectives and since not everyone can get in the car and curate a mix of regional, political, socioeconomic, and ethnic identities, I decided I'd do it for you. We need a positive view of the contributions people are making to their local communities that we're not getting from the media. Here is a sampling of some of those interviewed:

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<p><i>Rise: How Empowering Women Elevates Us All </i>is about how society benefits as a whole when women are given the chance to come into their power. <i>Rise </i>seeks to not only illustrate the various reasons why female empowerment is important, but also aims to provide guidance on how we can support the women around us and allow them the chance to create a positive impact on their own lives, their communities, and even the world.<br/><br/>My name is Shana Abraham and I am the author of <i>Rise: How Empowering Women Elevates Us All</i>. I wrote this book because I’ve come to realize just how important and powerful female empowerment is, not just for women but for society as a whole. We can look at its effects from any perspective — political, social, health, economic, etc. — and it always results in progress.<br/><br/>There are many people who want to empower women, but don’t know the most effective ways to encourage them. There are also many young women who want to create social change, but don’t know where to start. Many women would benefit from learning about the tools that can help them, but also from learning that they are not alone in the challenges that they face.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the close relationship between gender equity and global health. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for female empowerment in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you create social change and support the women around you.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the various levels of adversity that women face daily, and the core principles of female changemakers who've been able to overcome such challenges, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How there are many different ways to be an effective female leader and the range of experiences that can create an impact. You’ll learn from stories about Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by the Taliban, to Elyse Fox, who battled with depression her entire life and discover the various ways women can overcome their forms of adversity to advance a greater cause.</li>
<li>How Mercy Akuot was a child bride in Sudan, and how after days of violence and struggle, she was able to get help and escape this fate. You’ll be inspired by her resilience and how she’s used this experience to fight negative cultural practices across the globe.</li>
<li>How it’s not about giving women charity, but rather a chance to fight for what they deserve, and how young women across the globe have championed a variety of causes, from Jihye Yang in South Korea, Suhani Jalota in India, and Nadya Okamoto in America.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you either are or know a young woman who wants to be a leader in their own right. They may look up to certain female public figures, but don’t know just how powerful they themselves can be when given the right resources. With the stories and insights you find in <i>Rise</i>, you’ll learn effective strategies to lift up the women around you and help them explore opportunities to create social impact.<br/><br/><i>Rise </i>is a non-fiction book that speaks to young women and their supporters who are looking at female empowerment and social change for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Rise: How Empowering Women Elevates Us All</h3>The book is written in 3 Parts...<br/><br/>Part 1 provides background on the female empowerment movement, the history of social change, and why many women continue to hesitate to create social change and/or take leadership roles. It highlights key insights, such as how women tend to reinvest 90% of their income into their families when economically empowered, in comparison to the average 30-40% from men. Part 1 also delves into how social change has been amplified due to the advancement of technology in recent years, such as through social media campaigns, online crowdfunding sources, etc.<br/><br/>Part 2 explores the core principles of female changemakers and details the stories of how they’ve been able to cultivate qualities such as authenticity in order to attain their level of success. You’ll see how adversity can come in various forms, from violent encounters like Malala’s experience to mental health struggles like Elyse Fox, and how with resilience, one can find ways to overcome these challenges. Part 2 also speaks to the importance of a support network and illustrates the various levels in which a young woman can be encouraged and advocated for.<br/><br/>Part 3 centers around how to empower women and girls. It lays out the various challenges to empowerment, such as how many young girls are forced to turn to sex work in order to pay their school fees, allowing them to continue their education and avoid being married off early. It dives into the various methods of empowerment: psychological, social, economic, education, and more. Factors such as the lack of academic opportunities for girls is costing our society trillions of dollars, demonstrating one of the reasons it’s imperative that we not only acknowledge the necessity of female empowerment but also act on this issue. This final part shows that there are numerous ways to move the world towards a more equitable society and that it’s never too early or too late to start supporting women.<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>

<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>

<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this summer</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>When I pre-sell 100 physical copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a Spanish translation. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a Hindi translation. These translations were chosen as goals rather than a hardcover or audiobook in order to expand the reach of the book to people who may not be comfortable reading English, many of whom belong to low-resource areas and may need the tools within it the most. <br/><br/>I am also offering some <i><strong>exclusive rewards</strong></i> for people who<u> pre-order my book now</u>:</p>

And, if all goes well, your contributions will also help us launch the next book in The Little Loka™ India series.  We are all about creating a sustainable model.  </p><p><b>Seeding Tomorrow’s Leaders:</b> Paying it forward was a mandatory part of our mission and business model.  It made sense to us to focus our giving on India (the country we’re writing about) and on young social entrepreneurs dedicated to making a difference in their respective communities.  We also realized early on that allocating a percentage of our profit was not ideal for us because there was no guarantee that this amount would be significant enough to make an impact.  So, we decided to set aside a pre-determined pool of money for each young leader.  We’ll make two payments to them over the course of one year.  Thus, your contribution to our campaign will also help us fund the two amazing young leaders whom we’ve vetted and selected - <a href=""http://2lokas.com/youth-empowerment/sumeet-gade/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sumeet Gade </a>and <a href=""http://2lokas.com/youth-empowerment/aarti-naik/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aarti Naik</a>.  Both began their social ventures when they were only 20 years-old and amidst their own challenging circumstances.  Sumeet started Pragati, a program to promote the recovery of children in hospitals.  Aarti began SAKHI for Girls Education, an initiative aimed at promoting education for girls within slums.  For more information on the pre-selected projects and their amazing founders, feel free to visit the <a href=""http://2lokas.com/youth-empowerment/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tomorrow’s Leaders</a> page on our website.  </p><p><b>Book Donations:</b> Although the focus of our books, and our venture in general, is global in nature, we’d like to support communities within the United States as well.  We live in a pretty special place, indeed.  And, there clearly is a need for our support here, particularly given the increasingly diverse country we live in.  Our plan is to donate Little Loka™ books to communities in need - via libraries, Head Start programs, etc.  We feel that this will be a wonderful way to not only support more traditional education and literacy efforts targeting young children, but to foster a greater understanding of the cultural similarities and differences among us all as well.  </p><p><b>Perks:</b> And...finally!  As much as we’d love to be able to provide the perks we’re offering through the various tiers for free, our budget just won’t allow it.  Le grand sigh. Anyway, the good news, because there’s always good news, many of our perks will be 100% handmade and/or personalized with the help of our in-house artist and illustrator extraordinaire who has an eye for creative merch and product design.  Not to mention, she’s clearly quite talented when it comes to artistic endeavors.  There are also some fabulous organizations that have agreed to lend a hand by subsidizing their work so we can offer specific perks to you!  So, we’ve built the cost of design, printing, and production into our goal total.  And, if you absolutely love something and want more of it or if you’re interested in additional items we might offer, we’ll also be selling items separately through our online storefront.  </p><p><br/></p><p>                                                              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/193454/files/20131112150038-3Logos.png?1384297238"" src="""" style=""width: 79.30434782608695px; height: 24px;""/><br/></p><p>                                                        <br/><b>LET'S SURPASS $25,000!</b></p><p><b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></b></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/193285/files/20131112134119-easelly_visual__2_.jpg?1384292479"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span>                                                               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/193454/files/20131112150038-3Logos.png?1384297238"" src="""" style=""width: 80.64px; height: 24px;""/><br/></span></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span>                                                            <br/></span></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span>ACCOUNTABILITY = AWESOME</span></p>We’re known to geek out to cool visuals, so, rather than try to explain where each of the estimated dollar amounts is going, we figured we’d provide an infographic in the form of a flow-chart instead.<br/><p></p>

<p></p></div>","IN CASE YOU DON'T READ FURTHER, THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN ORDER THE BOOK (print copy starting at the $15 giving level).  THANKS FOR READING THIS MUCH! Dear Visionary,Hello!  And, Namaste.  You’re undoubtedly here for a reason, and we thank you.  You may be here because you love our idea of creating a children’s board book series that promotes greater cultural awareness and openness, starting with India.  You may also like the fact that we’re trying to give back to some amazing young leaders in India.  You may also be here because you assumed, based on the 2Lokas name or something else and totally random (it happens), that we’re offering some super-cool, human-sized gadget that will beam you up to an otherworldly place, and back, in 3.74 minutes.  Or, simply, that we’re just two crazy ladies.  In any case, we believe you may also be reading this because you share our larger vision of building connections in the work that we do, and cultivating “youthfulness” throughout the world. And, by youthful we don’t mean age.  Age is just a number, an arbitrary numerical assignment.  By youthful, we mean the curiosity, the openness, the fun and fearlessness that we associate with being young - that we see and admire in our own little ones.  We could certainly use more of that in the world and we truly believe it’s in all of us, perhaps hidden or forgotten, but it’s there.  So, by investing in our first board book, you’re also investing in our shared vision.  Thats right, now you’re a part of this vision, so jump up, jump down, and get excited!Of course, for those of you who are wondering what on earth we’re talking about, don’t worry, we’re going to take a turn for the tangible and concrete with bullet points, photos, infographics, and more. Starting...now.Your contribution to this campaign will not only be forever appreciated, but it will also:
Help us launch The Little Loka™ Series with our first children’s board book - “Maya and Leela Present: Dances of India.” 
Allow us to pay it forward to the country we’re writing about (India!) and financially support young social entrepreneurs effecting social change in their communities. We’ll also be donating books here in the U.S. as part of our philanthropic efforts.
Enable us to build a business model that fully integrates social values, forges connections among people from varying backgrounds, and promotes the shared vision we mentioned above.
You’re probably also interested in who we are, and possibly even in how this whole thing came about.  Well, we’re two professionals, two mothers, two college tennis buddies, two lo(c)kas.  We noticed a dearth of books aimed at the youngest readers (ages 0-4) that reflected the rich cultural diversity around us - both in the United States and around the globe.  Thus, our book project, with a social twist, was born!  We believe it’s never too early, or too late for that matter, to open up to and better understand the world.  And, 2Lokas (the venture we started) and this book project are part of our own effort to create a meaningful and successful social enterprise model for ourselves and for others.That’s essentially it!  Feel free to scroll down for additional details on the campaign including: where specifically your money will go, awesome perks, and our hopefully not too lofty monetary goals. Even if you’re not particularly interested in getting your hands on a book (you can always get a gift for someone or we can donate one or many books on your behalf - clearly, the options are abound!), we still invite you to consider contributing to this journey of ours.  Likewise, if you’re in the Washington, D.C. area, think about coming out to our Book Preview shin-dig on November 17th, which may or may not involve some form of Indian dance (so get ready to Free Your Dance!). Check back for updates on this!Anyway, we understand that there are many cyber places and spaces you could be frequenting right now.  But, you’re here with us.  And, we thank you for that.  Much love,Kyra + Malini2Lokas, LLCExpress. Engage. Empower.                                                                                                                     FUNDING DETAILSBook Launch: Your contributions will help us cover all aspects of the production of 500 print copies of the board book (board books are more expensive to print) plus the development and launch of an interactive digital version.  The costs include: publishing, editing, printing, packaging, design, illustrations, marketing, and ultimately distribution! And, if all goes well, your contributions will also help us launch the next book in The Little Loka™ India series.  We are all about creating a sustainable model.  Seeding Tomorrow’s Leaders: Paying it forward was a mandatory part of our mission and business model.  It made sense to us to focus our giving on India (the country we’re writing about) and on young social entrepreneurs dedicated to making a difference in their respective communities.  We also realized early on that allocating a percentage of our profit was not ideal for us because there was no guarantee that this amount would be significant enough to make an impact.  So, we decided to set aside a pre-determined pool of money for each young leader.  We’ll make two payments to them over the course of one year.  Thus, your contribution to our campaign will also help us fund the two amazing young leaders whom we’ve vetted and selected - Sumeet Gade and Aarti Naik.  Both began their social ventures when they were only 20 years-old and amidst their own challenging circumstances.  Sumeet started Pragati, a program to promote the recovery of children in hospitals.  Aarti began SAKHI for Girls Education, an initiative aimed at promoting education for girls within slums.  For more information on the pre-selected projects and their amazing founders, feel free to visit the Tomorrow’s Leaders page on our website.  Book Donations: Although the focus of our books, and our venture in general, is global in nature, we’d like to support communities within the United States as well.  We live in a pretty special place, indeed.  And, there clearly is a need for our support here, particularly given the increasingly diverse country we live in.  Our plan is to donate Little Loka™ books to communities in need - via libraries, Head Start programs, etc.  We feel that this will be a wonderful way to not only support more traditional education and literacy efforts targeting young children, but to foster a greater understanding of the cultural similarities and differences among us all as well.  Perks: And...finally!  As much as we’d love to be able to provide the perks we’re offering through the various tiers for free, our budget just won’t allow it.  Le grand sigh.

<p><strong>Hello readers! </strong></p>
<p>My name is Megan Nantel and I need your help so that I can do science this summer!  I’m a grade 12 student living in Vancouver, British Columbia and I am going to be graduating at the end of June.  Since I will be attending university next year, I definitely need to get a summer job to save up... BUT I would much rather continue to work on some science projects that I started during the school year instead!</p>
<p>Your support would allow be to continue my science research project and continue to develop a science blogging network for teens! Working on these science endeavors this year has helped me realize that I want to continue with science in my future.  I really enjoy both the areas of scientific research and science communication; hence, I want to work on these two important <strong>cultures</strong> of science this summer!</p>
<p>My research project is on Okanagan grapes yeasts ability to use diesel as a carbon source (<a href=""http://futurescienceleaders.org/wild-destroyers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://futurescienceleaders.org/wild-destroyers/</a>). Hydrocarbon spills and hydrocarbon waste (like oil containers or oil drums) can be detrimental to the environment so scientists are looking at ways to use naturally occurring species to clean up this pollution!  Any information about microorganisms that can add to our collective knowledge of potential bioremediation and hydrocarbon degradation methods is critical to finding the perfect combination that can one day reverse this sort of damage.  Your support would directly make a discovering like this a reality! I have already generated a lot of interest with this project and am competing at the Canada-Wide Science Fair but there is so much more I could do!</p>
<p>This summer I would also like to work on developing a newly created science blogging network for teens called <a href=""http://u20science.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">U20 Science</a>.  Science communication is critical for all scientists, especially young ones.  I would be spending the summer creating easy Wordpress tutorials and working on publicizing the site to teens.  The work with U20 Science would help lay the framework for future young scientists by educating them about the importance of science communication. </p>
<p>I really enjoy working on these projects but saving up for school is crucial for me.  Your support would mean that I could continue this work.  My goal is $1995 because I was born in 1995, however anything above this would be amazing! </p>
<p>As cheesy as it may sound, helping me means helping the future of science in general!  Helping me also means that you are eligible for some amazing perks!  Best of all, all of the perks accumulate so you don’t just receive the perk that matches with the donation but all of the perks before it as well!  I have items from homemade cards and key chains to acknowledgements in my paper and science cookies.  I will definitely treat all my supporters with love!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read my campaign! Please also use the Indiegogo share tools to help me generate interest in my project!</p>

As cheesy as it may sound, helping me means helping the future of science in general!  Helping me also means that you are eligible for some amazing perks!  Best of all, all of the perks accumulate so you don’t just receive the perk that matches with the donation but all of the perks before it as well!  I have items from homemade cards and key chains to acknowledgements in my paper and science cookies.  I will definitely treat all my supporters with love!
Thank you so much for taking the time to read my campaign! Please also use the Indiegogo share tools to help me generate interest in my project!
Sincerely,

<p><em>""The eight steps taught here may be seen as eight principles to live by.

<h3>Mysteries of the Tarot Unlocked!</h3>
<p>Who hasn't been fascinated by the mysterious tarot, writer and reader alike? For centuries, fortune-telling by the Tarot has caught many an imagination, but nothing like what I'm about to present here.</p>
<p>I am an editor who specializes in working with indie writers. But first and foremost I am a FICTION LOVER. There's only one thing I love more than my kids and Death By Chocolate Cake--and that's STORY. Editing is my career, and I've edited over seventy successful indie books. I know talent when I see it, and I know what it takes to make a story work. I have self-published myself so I know how to put a publication together. Need character references? Check out my Testimonial Page:  <a href=""http://wordwebbing.com/testimonials-3/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://wordwebbing.com/testimonials-3/</a><br/><br/>Want more? Just ask and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Except about the goat incident, with which I was not involved. (Can't reveal details; the gag order, you know.)</p>
<p>I've been reading since I was three years old. Through some dark and terrible times, the only thing which saved my life and my sanity, more than once, were books. Wonderful, fabulous, amazing stories spun by people I didn't know, but who saved me. People who had no idea the joy and wonderment that helped me survive some awful experiences. </p>
<p>I want to pay some of that back by presenting to you a collection of incredible stories based on the Major Arcana of the Tarot by an eclectic and tremendously talented group of writers. Each one has their own unique view and storytelling voice--voices I know will mesmerize, hypnotize, and satisfy your deep fiction itch. How do I know? Because I have either worked directly with some of these writers as an editor, or am a fan of their work. </p>
<p>In order to make this happen, I need your help. </p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Hi, my name is Torben Sonntag. ""Viel Bier um nix"" is the first book I´ve written. At first I did it for the fun of it. I thought it´s cool to have a self-written book in my shelf and it would make a perfect present for my small children some day. But the outcome was way better that I thought it could get. </span><br/></p>
<p>So I self-published it in Germany. I printed 2,500 copies and sold 1,000 within the first 4 month (till now). That means I have still invested much more time and money than I got back. But I believe, it´s a damn good book that should make much more people happy.  As my story plays on Hawaii, it would totally make sense to have an English version of it. This is the back cover text:</p>
<p>""Stefan and Jorn, two friends from school days, spend their windsurf-holidays on Maui / Hawaii. After a party they get brutally attacked. Stefan barely survives, Jorn is kidnapped. As quick and unbureaucratic help from the local police is unlikely and  time is running, Stefan needs to find his friend on his own. </p>
<p>A hot trail leads to Kahoolawe, a Hawaiian island that has been used as a training target for the military since decades and is currently being cleared of unexploded ordnance. When Stefan sets off to rescue his friend, he has no idea that hunting is just about to begin...""</p>
<p></p>
<p>Review by n-tv.de (one of the biggest news-channels in Germany): <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">„Drugs, shootings, deaths, nasty characters, and a ludicrously thrilling story. All this is part of ""Viel Bier um nix"" by Torben Sonntag. The novel really lives up to it´s subtitle ""A Hawaiian action thriller ""!</span></p>
<p>Review by Kieler Nachrichten (regional newspaper in Northern Germany): <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">„It starts on a container ship somewhere in the South China Sea and ends in Kiel between „Fishbar“ and „Café do Sul“. In between you’ll find a crazy story about surfers, drug lords and a trip halfway around the world. ""Viel Bier um nix"" is the action-thriller by Torben Sonntag“</span></p>
<p>I already contacted some translators. To get a decent translation I have to invest 12.000 €. Of course it also takes money to get some marketing done and to print the English version. But if I can get 5.000 € here, I will start the project ""half way to Hawaii"" - The English titel of ""Viel Bier um nix""</p>
<p><b>Please help me to push this project further. Who know´s maybe my next campaign is to finance a movie of my story!</b></p>

The $10 perk should read ""DRM-free"" rather than just ""DRM"".Here at Silence in the Library Publishing, we've put out what we like to think are some really great products. Many of you, who know us from Kickstarter, have taken the journey with us from our first anthology, Time Traveled Tales, through Athena's Daughters and Apollo's Daughters, all the way to the graphic novel Icarus. Many of those projects have captured the imagination of a large number of readers. Never before, though, have we launched a project with the power to galvanize the entire science fiction and fantasy community, from authors and artists, to publishers and readers, like this one. This time, you see, we're taking care of our own. And that's when all of us are at our best. When we, as a community, are supporting each other.The purpose of this anthology is to provide that kind of support to author CJ Henderson. Let me start off though, by saying that this is not charity. We are not simply collecting money and handing it off to a needy individual to help pay medical expenses. No, what we are doing here is endowing a grant. A grant that will allow CJ to continue to produce the kinds of stories that CJ writes. Stories with the power to entertain and captivate us all. We are making an investment in CJ.All of the authors, artists, publishers, graphic designers, and other professionals involved in this project are assigning what would be our portions of this anthology to that grant.Those professionals include authors like Kevin J. Anderson and Rebecca Moesta,Danielle Ackley-McPhail, Jack Dann, Ed Greenwood, Joe Haldeman, Nancy Holder,Tanya Huff, Gail Z. Martin, Jean Rabe, Mike Resnik, Janine K. Spendlove, Michael A. Stackpole, Anton Strout, Robert E. Vardeman, Elizabeth A. Vaughan, Gene Wolfe, Bryan Young, Timothy Zahn…well the the list goes on and on. It also includes artists like Alan M. Clark, Mark Dos Santos, Ben Fogletto, Thomas Nackid, Matt Slay, and Christina Yoder. Why are we doing that? If you know CJ or his work, you know the answer.CJ Henderson is a working author who has spent years writing insightful and entertaining books in a wide array of genres. He's also spent those years sharing his humor and good nature not just in his stories, but with the science fiction and fantasy community as a whole. A staple at conventions around the country, CJ has always made a point of being generous with his time and experience. And, oh boy, is there some experience! CJ, in addition to writing fiction, has worked as a movie house manager, waiter, drama coach, fast food jockey, interior painter, blackjack dealer, book reviewer, stockman, English teacher, roadie, advertising salesman, creative writing instructor, supernatural investigator, bank guard, storage coordinator, children’s theater director, card shark, film critic, dishwasher, magazine editor, traffic manager, short-order cook, stand-up comic, interview & general article writer; toy sales-man, camp counselor, movie booker, street mime, lounge lizard, and as a senior editor of legal publications at Matthew Bender & Co., Inc. And he's used all of this experience to inform his writing and his interactions with fans and fellow authors.CJ is facing a painful battle with a cancer that all of us, including CJ, thought he had beaten. Well, It has come back with a vengeance. Here's the story in CJ's own words:CJ Henderson here. Or, as I'm known these days, cancer boy. Here it is ... what's wrong with me. The abridged edition.Last year my leg swelled up massively, and this led to the discovery of blood clots which led to the discovery of cancer. Specifically, non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.

<ul>
<li>Translation and publication of the book into Spanish and Portuguese. (Yes, other languages will follow, but I think those are the most requested)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>The creation of an audio book (read by me in a professional studio)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>The great Book Tour of 2014. Yup, I will be wandering about far and wide giving talks, sharing ideas, hanging out with all who contributed to help me make the book a success.</li>

<p style=""""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Well, I wrote a book...</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The manuscript is finally finished. Ten years... </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Who am I? My name is </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Zan Perrion</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> and I have been traveling and lecturing and wondering about the philosophy of beauty for many years. In 2002, I founded the Ars Amorata movement.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What is the Ars Amorata? It is a celebration of the art of seduction, the rebirth of romance, and a lifelong quest for beauty and adventure...</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As I mentioned, I have been writing this book for ten years and it has not been an easy task! It is a book of ideas, which is, I suspect, the hardest thing to capture. At any rate, the manuscript is now finished.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The book itself is multi-layered (which is part of the reason it was difficult to write). In simplest terms, it begins with a man and a woman on a train. She is there to interview him because he wrote a book called </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Alabaster Girl</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> – the memories and impressions and half-remembered dreams of his lifetime in the arms and company of women. He has been interviewed before and thus, is ready for her questions. But she pushes for more. Who is he really? she asks. And why do women respond to him in ways they never do to other men?</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>He looks at her and realizes he has never told anyone the secrets to his success with women, and so now, for whatever reason, he does. The rest of the book then is the musings of a seducer. - a discourse, a brain-dump of everything he knows about the heart and soul of women. And interspersed throughout his discourse are excerpts of the book he wrote: <b>The Alabaster Girl</b>.</p>
<p>So my book has three layers (and thus three distinct ""voices""). Each chapter begins with the train journey interview (<i>Voice 1</i>), then opens up into his conversation to women in general about the way his mind works (<i>Voice 2</i>), and is sprinkled throughout with pieces from his book (<i>Voice 3</i>).</p>
<p>So there you have it... I wrote a book called <b>The Alabaster Girl</b> about a man who wrote a book called <b>The Alabaster Girl</b>! At its core, it is a book <i>about</i> the heart of women written <i>to</i> the heart of women. Ah, how presumptuous is that?</p>
<p>Is it a story? Not really. Is it self-help? No. Is it philosophy? I am not sure. Is it a novel? I suppose. But it is a novel without plot or characters or anything really. So it is hard to categorize!</p>
<p>Here are the chapters:</p>
<p></p>

<p>What's next? The publishing and promotion process. My goal is to have it published on my birthday, <b>December 14, 2013</b>. In order to do that, it is necessary for me to completely focus on this project until then. This means that I need to slow down my schedule of talks and live events. I love doing those events and I will continue to do them again in the future, of course, but for the next couple of months, I need to stop everything and concentrate only on this considerable project.</p>
<p>This is where you come in, dear reader. I am seeking a few angel sponsors. My book will come out eventually anyway, but your contribution will help to smooth the process and allow it to be published by my exacting, albeit arbitrary, deadline.</p>
<p></p>

The campaign for my upcoming book is an ongoing success. Thank you to all who contributed. I will be spending all of my time in January signing and sending out your physical copies. I will be busy... we have contributions from over thirty countries!Again, to everyone who has supported the project thus far, thank you!And if you haven't signed up yet to get your personalized, signed copy (or your early-bird digital review copy) of the book, it's not too late. There is still several days to go before the campaign ends! So if you have been hesitating, hesitate no more!Any amount I receive above the campaign target amount will go directly to the following:

Translation and publication of the book into Spanish and Portuguese. (Yes, other languages will follow, but I think those are the most requested)

The creation of an audio book (read by me in a professional studio)

The great Book Tour of 2014. Yup, I will be wandering about far and wide giving talks, sharing ideas, hanging out with all who contributed to help me make the book a success.

That's it... I think you will like the book and to be frank, I am nervous to finally release into the wild after ten years!And now... as a gift for meeting and exceeding our target amount, I have attached a short passage from the book itself!Here's the link:The Alabaster Girl - Indiegogo Excerpt Enjoy,Zan Perrion_____________________________________________________________________________
   And here is the original pitch...




Short Summary

Note: I forgot to add this to the $50 and $100 (signed physical copy) option: Please add $10 shipping for orders outside of Canada


Well, I wrote a book...
The manuscript is finally finished. Ten years... 
Who am I? My name is Zan Perrion and I have been traveling and lecturing and wondering about the philosophy of beauty for many years. In 2002, I founded the Ars Amorata movement.
What is the Ars Amorata? It is a celebration of the art of seduction, the rebirth of romance, and a lifelong quest for beauty and adventure...
As I mentioned, I have been writing this book for ten years and it has not been an easy task! It is a book of ideas, which is, I suspect, the hardest thing to capture. At any rate, the manuscript is now finished.
The book itself is multi-layered (which is part of the reason it was difficult to write). In simplest terms, it begins with a man and a woman on a train. She is there to interview him because he wrote a book called The Alabaster Girl – the memories and impressions and half-remembered dreams of his lifetime in the arms and company of women. He has been interviewed before and thus, is ready for her questions. But she pushes for more. Who is he really? she asks. And why do women respond to him in ways they never do to other men?


He looks at her and realizes he has never told anyone the secrets to his success with women, and so now, for whatever reason, he does. The rest of the book then is the musings of a seducer. - a discourse, a brain-dump of everything he knows about the heart and soul of women. And interspersed throughout his discourse are excerpts of the book he wrote: The Alabaster Girl.
So my book has three layers (and thus three distinct ""voices""). Each chapter begins with the train journey interview (Voice 1), then opens up into his conversation to women in general about the way his mind works (Voice 2), and is sprinkled throughout with pieces from his book (Voice 3).
So there you have it... I wrote a book called The Alabaster Girl about a man who wrote a book called The Alabaster Girl! At its core, it is a book about the heart of women written to the heart of women. Ah, how presumptuous is that?
Is it a story? Not really. Is it self-help? No. Is it philosophy? I am not sure. Is it a novel? I suppose. But it is a novel without plot or characters or anything really. So it is hard to categorize!
Here are the chapters:



The Way of Beauty


The Way of Seduction


The Way of Discovery


The Way of the Natural


The Way of Men


The Way of Women


The Way of Love


The Way of Salvation


The Way of Beauty





What's next? The publishing and promotion process. My goal is to have it published on my birthday, December 14, 2013. In order to do that, it is necessary for me to completely focus on this project until then. This means that I need to slow down my schedule of talks and live events. I love doing those events and I will continue to do them again in the future, of course, but for the next couple of months, I need to stop everything and concentrate only on this considerable project.
This is where you come in, dear reader. I am seeking a few angel sponsors. My book will come out eventually anyway, but your contribution will help to smooth the process and allow it to be published by my exacting, albeit arbitrary, deadline.

So it is my honor to ask for help. My direct appeal to you is this... I am inviting you to help release sponsor the publication and presentation of this book.I like to think of it exactly like the artists and minstrels of days gone by - they sought out friends and patrons who believed in their work enough to lend support. Or perhaps it's like intrepid explorers of centuries past - knowing that they could not do it alone, they sought out patrons and requested financial backing for their dangerous and risky overseas explorations!
Well, that is perhaps a little overly dramatic... my book is hardly dangerous or risky or intrepid, but you get the point!
How much do I need? I calculate 15,000 dollars to pay for everything - the book publishing, the book design, the website, the promotion and book tour (yes, I plan to hit the road for all of 2014 and will very likely be in a city near you!)
That's it... this is a very personal project and thus, a very personal request. If you are willing to contribute something toward that amount, you will forever be regarded by me as a personal patron. For that I will always be grateful._____________________________________________________________________________UPDATE (November 4): Very few people have ever read the manuscript of my book. Not even parts of it. Why? I don't know. Like I said, it is deeply personal and I have kept it close to my chest over the years. I think only four people (including my editor in New York) have ever read it in its entirety! And now I am about to present it to all of you!One person who has read it recently is my good friend, Steve Pavlina (Personal Development For Smart People - www.stevepavlina.com). Here is his proffered testimonial:
""The Alabaster Girl is a richly compelling, beautifully poetic journey into the heart of relationships. With his unapologetic wisdom and tough compassion, Zan delivers an astonishingly insightful guide to the paradoxes of love. This opus is best relished in small sips, allowing time for its many a-ha moments to weave themselves into your own tapestry of self-discovery. Highly recommended!""

Why is it that you get a smile and a personal welcome when picking up a cup of coffee and you get coffee in a plastic cup when you buy a $250,000 car?




Why is TripAdvisor so successful ? Why are people venting their opinions on everything wrong in a hotel?




And why is the CHO* more important than the CEO?


In ""What companies can learn from butlers"" Vincent Vermeulen bundles his experience of founding his own butlerschool.
While training butlers and companies he discovered that any company can profit from the techniques he developed over the years.
WAIT! Not only companies can benefit from this book. You as well ! You will learn powerful techniques butlers use everyday to apply in your personal life and boost your self-confidence.
   What We Need & What You Get To be able to publish the book we are looking for funding:


The target amount will give us the opportunity to develop beautifully crafted books in print.


You can get your hands on the book one week prior to the actual launch.


Some of the perks are really amazing. How about a private training at your company or having a private butler for the weekend in your house?


Should we not hit our target, the book will still be published in ebook format.


    The Impact We have tons of stories of people coming to us wanting to be trained as a butler. Shortly after the training they start working all over the world. 



Someone working in the media for years, all of sudden is working for a wealthy family in the most stunning houses in the world. And we want more stories like this.



Big brands were be able to install a new mindset for their employees


A 20 year old applying these techniques is now making over $4000 in personal income per month doing what she loves


A lady thinking her career was over at 53 is providing top level service in Switzerland

These are only some of the stories you will read in the book and hopefully the book will write your story as well.

Risks & Challenges
 The funding will not only allow us to publish the book but also to partner with research institutes to make the book even better. Integrating studies of behavioral science together with renowned universities is only one benefit should we hit our target.
In any case, with or without funding, this will become a landmark book in business writing. So join us!

ABOUT THE BOOK:
""Naughty Girl's Guide to Las Vegas"" is a naughty travel guide to the city. It's part travel, history and coffee table book. 
""Your Naughty Travel Guide to Las Vegas is here! How many times have you traveled to a city and wondered where to go for the sexiest bars, clubs and restaurants? Where to attend the best swinger parties? How to find a fetish hotel that caters to your kinks? This is not your average travel book on Las Vegas, this is your naughty guide to the city. The book, written by sex coach and adult entertainer Sienna Sinclaire, is a gorgeous mix of travel information, sexy photos and naughty historical tidbits of Sin City's not so innocent past and present. It truly comes off as a naughty Frommer’s travel guide, complete with listings for individuals to research on their own before planning out their trip. Get your copy today and learn all about Vegas' naughty side. Whether you live in Las Vegas or you're traveling solo, with your girlfriends or with your lover this book is an indispensable guide in the quest to discover the sexy side of Vegas. Plus this book lets you determine how naughty you want to get. Maybe you want some clean, sexy fun with your lover at a strip club where the girls keep their clothes on?

It’s not just “naughtiness” that you’re exploring but a celebration of local figures, businesses, history, products and food.""
 
This will be my second book in my naughty series, my first book was ""Naughty Girl's Guide to Los Angeles."" I funded and self-published the book all on my own but need to raise money for this book to keep the series going. 
I've had a huge success from my LA book with tons of radio and TV. I was even featured on a reality show for the upcoming Vegas book, hoping to promote it for when it comes out. 
The Los Angeles book won TWO awards for ""Best Travel Guide"" in 2013.
I want to turn this into a successful series of naughty travel guides, so that travelers have something different to experience in cities than your normal touristy stuff.
The Vegas book will be over 300 pages of naughty things to do in Las Vegas that I've personally researched on my own. It took me 2 years to research and write the book. 
You can learn more about my current book and upcoming Vegas book by visiting my website so you see what it's all about at www.NaughtyTravelGuide.com





WHAT THE MONEY WILL BE USED FOR:
The book is completely finished! Now the book just needs to be designed, edited and printed along with marketing. This is what I will be using the money for as it's not cheap to print a full color travel guide. 
The book is very well designed. I don't have sample pages of the Vegas book yet but you can view sample pages of the LA book below and more here http://www.thenaughtygirlsguide.com/user/naught... 










  
RISKS & CHALLENGES:
 This will be my second book so I'm completely aware that things take time with design, editing and printing. Right now the book is ready to head to the designers, then editor and finally off to the printers. I already know the time schedules of designing, editing and printing a book. So right now I'm looking for it to come out October/November 2014. It could come out earlier or later. But if it does come out later then I will personally contact anyone with the delays.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>I Love ""Weirdo Music""</h3> <p>That's how a friend once described the stuff I listen to: basically, music that is dark, intense, and/or transgressive in some way. Over the years I have supported music - and especially independent artists - in every way possible, from working in a music store to attending shows; booking shows; coordinating promotional campaigns; press releases; and music journalism (conducting interviews, writing music reviews, etc.) - <b><i>because I want these artists to continue making music</i></b>. </p>
<p>For a fan of contemporary industrial music, the acts on the bill for the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/events/680263258679204/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SE:UK Industrial Alliance festival</a> in London are too good to miss. To have them all performing on the same event, under the same roof, may never happen this way again. I want to be there to document the event, as a music journalist and photographer. </p>
<p>This may not seem like a big deal to many of you, but for me this will be like attending Woodstock. Getting there is an adventure that I hope to achieve with the help of friends, family and music fans who appreciate and/or share my passion. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Here's the Bottom Line</h3>
<div>$1000 is needed for airfare. It's essentially a weekend trip, during which time I intend to cover the festival for my blog, <a href=""http://factoryworkermedia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">factoryworkermedia.com</a>. </div>
<div>One of the blog's main goals is to acknowledge that today's music is as important and noteworthy as anything that came before, and worthy of serious consideration and analysis. That kind of writing doesn't happen as often as it could, but I do my best to contribute to the perpetuation of meaningful discourse.</div>
<div>As I mention in the pitch video, perks are essentially negotiable - maybe I can get you into a show, maybe you want a copy of the audio from one of my past interviews (the Emilie Autumn one is a personal favourite) - tell me what it was that prompted you to support the campaign, and let's see if we can't think of something personalized just for you. </div>

</div></div>","I Love ""Weirdo Music"" That's how a friend once described the stuff I listen to: basically, music that is dark, intense, and/or transgressive in some way. Over the years I have supported music - and especially independent artists - in every way possible, from working in a music store to attending shows; booking shows; coordinating promotional campaigns; press releases; and music journalism (conducting interviews, writing music reviews, etc.) - because I want these artists to continue making music. 
For a fan of contemporary industrial music, the acts on the bill for the SE:UK Industrial Alliance festival in London are too good to miss. To have them all performing on the same event, under the same roof, may never happen this way again. I want to be there to document the event, as a music journalist and photographer. 
This may not seem like a big deal to many of you, but for me this will be like attending Woodstock. Getting there is an adventure that I hope to achieve with the help of friends, family and music fans who appreciate and/or share my passion.    Here's the Bottom Line
$1000 is needed for airfare. It's essentially a weekend trip, during which time I intend to cover the festival for my blog, factoryworkermedia.com. 
One of the blog's main goals is to acknowledge that today's music is as important and noteworthy as anything that came before, and worthy of serious consideration and analysis. That kind of writing doesn't happen as often as it could, but I do my best to contribute to the perpetuation of meaningful discourse.
As I mention in the pitch video, perks are essentially negotiable - maybe I can get you into a show, maybe you want a copy of the audio from one of my past interviews (the Emilie Autumn one is a personal favourite) - tell me what it was that prompted you to support the campaign, and let's see if we can't think of something personalized just for you. 
Failing that, there's the default ""Postcards From the Edge"" perk. (Go on, admit it - you all love getting snail mail.) :)
    The Impact Usually I can manage travel costs myself, but earlier this fall I invested in a DSLR camera for my concert photography (of course that will pay for itself several times over in the long run - including this trip) and the timing of that acquisition sacrificed a significant portion of my travel fund. It's unlikely that a North American festival could book all of these European acts together on a single event any time soon, so your support will help to ensure that these talented independent artists get the recognition they deserve and, with a little luck, eventually they will be able to tour here, too.

 The usual work/travel challenges apply: jet lag, communication (do the tube stations still have free wi-fi?), local travel logistics (hence the concern about wi-fi), sufficient battery power and data storage, etc. I always bring a backup audio recorder and digital camera, and this won't be my first trip to London, so the biggest hurdle is just the usual crippling exchange rate.

<p><strong>Our transformation from a dysfunctional, unsustainable and spiritually empty society means a return to sacred civilization.  This is beyond “religion”. It is a return to the ways and values of honoring Earth, Life and Spirit.  My intention is to learn how to do this, and bring that learning back for all of us to share.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Most Westerners go on “vision quest” to discover themselves, or to work out some personal challenge.  Mine is different.  I am questing to discover the sacred roots of human civilization, and to find the path of return to a society that places Earth, Spirit and Life over the values of greed and selfishness.</p>
<p>This Summer, I am walking the path of sacred civilization, to the ancient Kingdom of Ladakh, in what is now Northern India, Northern Pakistan and Southern China.<br/><br/> This journey is to answer a Call. My eyes and Heart will be open for the Source.</p>
<p>I have been active in the field of “Societal Transformation” for over five decades, working to create an inclusive world that works for all beings.  My work has taken me to 38 countries, and to over 100 distinct cultures, on every continent with people on it. <br/><br/> But – I’ve always explored current, living cultures.  Now, I intend to use the past to help guide all of us to a viable future.  Your support will help all of us transform our world by rediscovering our roots.  I strongly believe that the way OUT of our current Mess will come from looking INTO the roots of sacred civilizations.</p>
<p>By “roots”, I don’t mean the Euro-centric and Spirit-depleted histories that we were taught in school.  My search will be well outside those “boxes” that confine our Spiritual and imaginal mental landscapes.<br/><br/> Although I use the word “sacred” I am NOT talking about “religion”.  Our ancient roots connected us to each other, to the Earth, to Life and to the Spirit.  Religions tend to do the opposite. (I am not against religion.  It is fine in its place – which is not running a society.)<br/><br/> Around the world, we find evidence that humans have lived (and many are still living), in sacred civilization.  We refer to “native” or “indigenous” people as those who practice ways of life that evidence a deep respect for Earth, all beings (and Life Itself) and Spirit.  The “indigenous” people hold to Transcendental ways of knowing, predicated on concepts and a world-view that has been transported over thousands of miles and thousands of years.<br/><br/> Or… from no time and no distance. </p>
<p>We see that “indigenous” people living in “sacred civilization” have a deep, mystical bond with All.  But, we rarely ask the question: “Where did they get it from?”  And, “Why are these sacred societies so similar in their cosmologies/ understandings about the Universe?  Where did they learn how to live in harmony with the Earth and each other?”  <br/><br/> There is evidence that the deep reverence for Earth, Spirit and Life originated in Central Asian shamans/ Spirit workers.  There is evidence that they spread this knowledge into North and South America and Europe.  There is evidence that the roots of Western civilization come from these same shamans of Central Asia.  However, rather than rely on this evidence, I intend to go to the source.<br/><br/><strong>A Spiritual Journey – Not an Academic One…</strong><br/> This is not an academic journey.  I am not traveling to support or refute some premise.  This is not (just) a “writing” assignment.  [I use the “writing” category simply because Indiegogo has no category for “social transformation” or “sacred journey”, or anything else like this campaign].</p>
<p><strong>What I Need:</strong><br/><br/> I will use the funds you give for the journey/ societal vision quest to the ancient civilization of Ladakh.  Specifically, funds will be used for  plane tickets, travel equipment, places to stay, hiring local guides, journey expenses to sacred sites, visas, travel insurance, cross-border expenses, recording equipment…<br/><br/> Any funds over my request will be used to fund a conference upon my return (slated for Fall, 2013).  “Societal Transformation and Sacred Civilization” will chronicle the journey, and will explore how we can incorporate the values and tools of sacred civilizations into our presently dysfunctional society. [I will use some additional funds to enhance the journey by obtaining more optimal travel arrangements, and by adding more locations, including possibly Nepal and Tibet.]</p>
<p><strong>The Impact:</strong><br/>  Funders get the satisfaction of knowing that they are active participants in the next big step in the transformation of our society.  With your contribution, you will become an active, positive and inclusive agent for the transformation of our society!  A little goes a long way: a little more even longer.</p>
<p><strong>If Short of Goal:</strong><br/><br/> Less than full funding will mean a scaled back journey.  Significantly below the funding request may mean scaling back on the ambitions for the journey itself.  [This may mean less than optimal travel arrangements (time and routes). Not having guides, translators, or appropriate ground transportation will limit what I will be able to discover, and paradoxically, make the journey more expensive.]</p>
<p>In a way, this journey is like a referendum on the state of our current civilization.  You “vote” of $100, or even $10, will send a message to all of us – that you recognize our present society is dysfunctional, and that you support the idea of bringing inclusivity and sacredness back to our human societies.  Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong><br/><br/><strong>First:</strong> Please know that even $5 or $10 is significant in the world of crowd-funding.  Don’t feel self-conscious because you don’t have hundreds to donate. (And, don’t feel self-conscious if you do!  Give with gusto!)  Any and all of your dollars will contribute to the “buzz” around this project.<br/><br/><strong>Second:</strong>  Please spread the word!   It’s through people like you telling their friends and associates that word of this journey will spread to others.  Please put this link into your church’s weekly bulletin (or mosque, temple, kovil…).  Talk about the “vision quest” with friends, family and co-workers.  Show your support. </p>
<p><strong> Third:</strong>  Do you know of any shamans or spiritually-minded people in Ladakh?  Trustworthy drivers or good places to stay in Leh?  I already have contacts there, but your <strong>personal</strong> knowledge and experience can help make this quest a success! [Please... no advertisements for services.  They will be ignored.]</p>
<p><strong>Fourth:</strong>  Please hold the meta-vision of “a world that works for all”.  For the sake of our planet and for the sake of our humanity, we need a meta-vision that is larger than our individual selves and longer than our life span.  We need a human society based on sacredness.</p>
<p>Peace,</p>

Be part of the world peace tipping point and celebrate the 10th anniversary of <b>Dr. Will Tuttle's</b> groundbreaking book <b><i>The World Peace Diet</i> </b>by backing our next decade's efforts of self-publishing media:  two <i>World Peace Diet</i> companion books--<b><i>World Peace Diet Cookbook </i></b>by Culinary Olympic award-winning Chef Mark Stroud and <b><i>World Peace Yoga</i> book</b> by nationally known yogini, and founder of World Peace Yoga Anna Ferguson. Our second decade also includes realizing our dream of nationally launching a <b>World Peace Diet Cuisine </b>line of organic, gluten-free, sugar-free vegan food products. How many times has Dr. Will Tuttle been asked
after creating this practical tool, <i>The World Peace Diet</i>, “what do I eat on
this diet?”<span> And our answer is, “you have
read the book, now eat the food."" </span>To achieve this, funds raised in this campaign will also support the World Peace Diet Cuisine food line's development. This incorporates a commissary food-manufacturing kitchen 
—
the <b>Peace House Grille</b> dining area — for test marketing food products for a national reach while providing Cincinnati local
sustainable vegan eating. <span></span><span></span> On top of this, assistance with these projects will indirectly make expansion of the <b><a href=""http://worldpeaceearth.com/jubilee-animal-sanctuary/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jubilee Animal Sanctuary</a> </b>possible, as it will be funded through their financial prosperity.<br/><div align=""center"">

<span><p>In this third trimester of our campaign, we focus on what these tools – cookbook, yoga book, and food products - mean to you and us in the creation of a sustainable economic environment for our various projects.  By generating additional income from these economic engines, we are able to make our <a href=""http://jubileepeacefest.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jubilee Peace Fest</a> festival ticket price much lower and accessible to all income levels for people seeking a life-changing spiritual experience.  And very dear to our hearts, this revenue gives us the means to sustain and expand our Jubilee Animal Sanctuary. Even after our recent move, the horses require more land to graze and exercise, more land to grow hay, and better indoor living conditions. With more land and a new barn, Maitreya and Arjuna will then be able to welcome new fellow animal (people) friends, such as cows, pigs, chickens, sheep, goats, and ducks.  Our intention is to ultimately create a self-sustaining sanctuary from self-generating income. With this model, we would ideally only require outside assistance such as crowdfunding for larger one-time principal improvements. This is our immediate and long-term sustainable economic plan and we ask you today to be part of this ongoing mission.<br/></p>

<h3>A Little History</h3>
<p>Since 2005, the first World Peace Diet study
group is still going strong in this 10<sup>th</sup> year anniversary meeting
twice monthly in Cincinnati and sharing stimulating
conversations and delicious vegan eats. In the last ten years, we have served up spiritual and educational food in different formats, such as classes, workshops, teacher
trainings, and festivals to thousands of people. Our Center creates spiritual opportunities
for under-served populations, such as the Deaf community, inner city kids, and the
homeless. <br/></p></span><span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437688443/enms4wrulh5rv89rkd1f.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 264px; height: 176px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437688515/lqg3z1znv1jervu8l0no.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 345.818px; height: 180px;""/><br/></p>

<h3>PERK Your Interest to Reach Our Goal</h3>

Our goal set for this campaign is $72,000, with a stretch goal of an additional
$72,000, for a total of $144,000. Your contributions are to be used in the
following manner:<p></p>
<p>$45,000 pays for completing our <b><i>World Peace Diet</i> <i>Cookbook</i></b> and <b><i>World Peace Yoga</i> book</b>, including the shared expenses of editors,
copywriters, layout designers, photographers, printing, distributing, e-book
formatting, marketing and promoting the books. The more contributions we
receive, the more books we are able print and more widely spread our
peace-filled message.<br/><br/>$27,000 <span></span> pays for the costs involved
with creating the first <b>World Peace Diet Cuisine</b> food line prototype, including market
evaluation and research, product analysis, development of prototype: recipe creation, recipe
testing ingredients, recipe testing time, recipe testers for market testing, food photographer,
and packaging design, followed by national launch preparation and further marketing and promotion. In addition, we are now able to hire the necessary architectural, engineering, and design firms to bring forward our commissary test kitchen to early stages of construction.  <br/><br/>The first $72,000 is for self-publishing our <i>World Peace Diet
Cookbook</i> and <i>World Peace Yoga</i> book, and creating our first
prototype of a World Peace Diet Cuisine food line.  <br/>
<br/>
Ideally this campaign stretches to $144,000, raising an additional $72,000 in
contributions allowing us to pay for the expansion of our building. This includes construction
costs so that our <b>Global World Peace Diet Center’s</b> footprint increases by 600
square feet and is LEED Platinum Certified using green and sustainable building
materials, energy star food preparation equipment, and earth friendly systems,
such as solar and permaculture for our commissary kitchen and additional
spiritual practice space that is handicap accessible.<span>  <br/></span></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>By reaching our goal to publish and produce these products and
services, together we are more deeply and widely spreading the message of kindness and compassion articulated by<i> The
World Peace Diet</i> in very practical and useful everyday ways of living.<span> It is
by increasing, improving, and promoting more “all” vegan “compassionate” products, services, and programs, that,
this message becomes the change. This is a call, a clarion call, for more vegan businesses,
more vegan programs, services, institutions--you name it, on every street
corner, a vegan world. This is a huge
task, and, together, we are up to it! <br/><br/></span>
<p><span>It is our belief that it is the vegans, yogis, and other compassionate people of the world and their energy of
kindness and gentleness who have kept this planet from completely imploding.
Therefore, we are asking all vegans and animal lovers to step up and join with us
and other vegan businesses and organizations to become an even greater force
for peaceful change in the world.<span> Get
involved, collaborate with other like-minded souls with your time, talent, and
money! Peace 
—real peace in our lifetime
<span>—</span> is doable, now, today, not in some far off blurry future. </span><br/></span></p>
<p>Please be part of this tipping point for change and celebrate with us this 10<sup>th</sup> year anniversary of <i>The World Peace Diet</i> and the potential

</div></div>","Summary
 

Be part of the world peace tipping point and celebrate the 10th anniversary of Dr. Will Tuttle's groundbreaking book The World Peace Diet by backing our next decade's efforts of self-publishing media:  two World Peace Diet companion books--World Peace Diet Cookbook by Culinary Olympic award-winning Chef Mark Stroud and World Peace Yoga book by nationally known yogini, and founder of World Peace Yoga Anna Ferguson. Our second decade also includes realizing our dream of nationally launching a World Peace Diet Cuisine line of organic, gluten-free, sugar-free vegan food products. How many times has Dr. Will Tuttle been asked
after creating this practical tool, The World Peace Diet, “what do I eat on
this diet?” And our answer is, “you have
read the book, now eat the food."" To achieve this, funds raised in this campaign will also support the World Peace Diet Cuisine food line's development. This incorporates a commissary food-manufacturing kitchen 
—
the Peace House Grille dining area — for test marketing food products for a national reach while providing Cincinnati local
sustainable vegan eating.  On top of this, assistance with these projects will indirectly make expansion of the Jubilee Animal Sanctuary possible, as it will be funded through their financial prosperity.
       
       
In this third trimester of our campaign, we focus on what these tools – cookbook, yoga book, and food products - mean to you and us in the creation of a sustainable economic environment for our various projects.  By generating additional income from these economic engines, we are able to make our Jubilee Peace Fest festival ticket price much lower and accessible to all income levels for people seeking a life-changing spiritual experience.  And very dear to our hearts, this revenue gives us the means to sustain and expand our Jubilee Animal Sanctuary. Even after our recent move, the horses require more land to graze and exercise, more land to grow hay, and better indoor living conditions. With more land and a new barn, Maitreya and Arjuna will then be able to welcome new fellow animal (people) friends, such as cows, pigs, chickens, sheep, goats, and ducks.  Our intention is to ultimately create a self-sustaining sanctuary from self-generating income. With this model, we would ideally only require outside assistance such as crowdfunding for larger one-time principal improvements. This is our immediate and long-term sustainable economic plan and we ask you today to be part of this ongoing mission.
   
Our two new books and our food product line will enable our current global outreach to deepen and further our
 vision of creating world peace one lifestyle change at a time. They 
also serve our 
mission of, educating, encouraging, researching and promoting a 
loving lifestyle to create virtuous, kind, gentle, and respectful 
relationships among all beings and the Earth, and contributing to peace throughout the world.





A Little History
Since 2005, the first World Peace Diet study
group is still going strong in this 10th year anniversary meeting
twice monthly in Cincinnati and sharing stimulating
conversations and delicious vegan eats. In the last ten years, we have served up spiritual and educational food in different formats, such as classes, workshops, teacher
trainings, and festivals to thousands of people. Our Center creates spiritual opportunities
for under-served populations, such as the Deaf community, inner city kids, and the
homeless.  

Our Global World Peace Diet Center sponsors the Jubilee Peace Fest, a life-changing jubilation of yoga, music, and food, a spiritual festival that has just celebrated its fifth year anniversary. The festival includes the World Peace Diet Facilitator Training as an
ongoing part of the event. One of our World Peace Diet Facilitator graduates recently directed and premiered the ground-breaking film Cowspiracy. The festival brings in many awe inspiring yogis,
activists, foodies, and musicians, such as, Sharon Gannon, Chloe Jo Davis,
Julia Butterfly Hill, Victoria Moran,
Sticman of Dead Prez, HuDost, and many others. 
   
(From left, Anna Ferguson, Mark Stroud, Will Tuttle, Madeleine Tuttle.)
Chef Mark Stroud is a Culinary
Olympic award-winning vegan chef, yoga (meditation & philosophy) teacher who conducts
classes, workshops, and has run multiple nationally recognized restaurants. Anna Ferguson’s knowledge of yoga and her ahimsic
(nonviolent) style of teaching derived from years of study and practice with
Doug Swenson and Julie Kirkpatrick, Sharon Gannon, and David Life of Jivamukti
Yoga. We are building on the work of Dr. Will Tuttle, author of the #1 Amazon best-seller, The World Peace Diet, now translated into over 15 languages. A former Zen monk with a
Ph.D. in education from U.C., Berkeley, Dr. Tuttle has worked extensively in intuition
development, spiritual healing, meditation, music, creativity, vegan living,
and cultural evolution. He and his wife Madeleine 
— a visionary artist whose work has been exhibited throughout North America and Europe—travel
together to educate and share the ideas in The World Peace Diet.
