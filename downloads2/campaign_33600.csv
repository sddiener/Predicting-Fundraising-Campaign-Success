<h3>Hi.  Thank you for reading.</h3>
<p>Please allow me to tell you briefly about myself.  I am currently one year into a two year volunteer service, living in the Gambia, West Africa.  I work with the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education and the Gambia Basketball Association.  Prior to coming to Africa, I worked for Flowing Wells School District in Tucson, AZ as a teacher and a coach.  </p>
<p>I met Lamin at about 10 PM one evening on my way home from the office.  To get home, I take 2 vehicles, the second of which drops me at the top of my street and I have to walk a couple kilometers ""inside"" to get to my compound.  At the top of my street, I can pay 8 dalasis (a quarter) and get a ride to my junction. The vehicle is called a gelli gelli and is an old van that is filled with about 20 passengers.  Lamin, thirteen years old, was working as a apprentee on this vehicle.  An apprentee calls out to potential customers, helps load passangers belongings, makes sure everybody has a seat, collects money, and distributes change.  This is not an easy job.  Usually apprentees are not 12 years old; they are usually at least 18.  Lamin is a different kind of kid.  He is tough, street smart, trustworthy, and when I met him, very sick.  After a couple months and countless trips to private clinics, the MRC, and the Banjul Teaching Hospital, Lamin has been diagnosed with extra-pulmonary Tuberculosis.  This is not contagious because it is not in his lungs but has relocated to his lymphnodes.  It will take 6-12 months of an antibiotic compound to get well.  The good news is, Lamin is getting his power back.  He is also getting his smile back.  You can learn a little more about that by checking out a few blogs written about him at <a href=""http://hugsfromsara.wordpress.com/2013/04/13/lamin/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://hugsfromsara.wordpress.com/2013/04/13/lamin/</a> and <a href=""http://hugsfromsara.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/knock-knock-knock/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://hugsfromsara.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/knock-knock-knock/</a>.</p>
<p>Lamin is an orphan who is taken care of by his Grandma to the best of her ability.  She is a fish seller at the market and has many children to take care of.  Lamin has been sick on and off his entire life and has never been properly diagnosed.  It is not easy to get good medical attention in the Gambia.  Now that he is on his way to getting better, Lamin wants to go to school.  He has went to school in the past and even though he is a bit behind, will catch up quickly.  He speaks English as well as most any boy his age who has the opportunity to go to school.  He is very anxious to learn to read and write.  It is currently summer break in the Gambia and my goal is to have Lamin in school at the start of the next school year.  I have one more year in which I will be able to see him off to a good start and establish the necessary support system.  </p>
<p>Working as a volunteer, I am able to directly contribute to causes that are legitimate and deserving.  The problem is that when situations like this one find me, I do not always have the financial resources to take action.  In my role here, I am paid the equivalent of a Gambian school teacher and this equates to about $200 a month.  You contribution will support Lamin through the next two years of his education.  At this point, I will be in the United States earning a salary and will be able to pick up where you generous support left off.  The donation will go to tuition, school supplies, school clothes, lunch money (which will be paid to my neighbor whom is a shop keeper and will ensure Lamin has something to eat everyday), and tutoring to get him caught up as he has been out of school for a while.  This project is sustainable because of my relationship with people in my community who will be here assisting after I am gone and my relationship with head teachers at Upper Basic Schools that I work.  Through my primary project I communicate with many Gambian teachers and principals online and because of this I will be able to continue sposoring Lamin after I have left the Gambia.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ebrima is a boy by whom I hope to do right before I go home.  I met hime on a trek through the Gambian countryside.  This boy, from a small village called Mandinary, treked miles and miles with us that day.  He was not annoying (as small boys can sometimes be), he was actually quite a good guide, and although our ""official"" toubab guide assured us he knew the route, I personally felt more comfortable having Ebrima as part of our group.  I had been in the Gambia for less than a month at this time and was wrapped up in the newness of it all.  I gave this boy my cell phone number before he left us that day.  After this, I learned of Ebrima's greatest quality.  Persistence.  Everytime Ebrima got some cell phone credit he would call or text me.  He knew little to no English at the time so these messages were hard to understand.  He wanted to go to school.  He called and greeted me many times before he finally had somebody take the phone and let his request be known.  So I travelled to Mandinary with the idea that for a few hundred dalasis I would be able to get Ebrima in to school.  If I could send a boy to school for the price of what you would spend on one dinner in America, I had to do it, right?  When I got to the school and sat down with the head teacher, I realized it wouldn't be so simple.  Ebrima was thirteen, but had never been to school.  He would have to start in third grade.  This was not ideal for anybody.  We would need to tutor him intensively so he could move through the grades more quickly than his peers.  He didn't need to catch up with the children his age who had started school on time but needed to get a little farther along.  Hiring a tutor was not something that fit into my budget.  He also needed a uniform, lunch money, etc.  I understand all of these things now, but at the time I was definitely knee deep in my learning curve.  With this new understanding of what it would take to sponsor a Gambian student, I paid Ebrima's tuition for the year, bought him notebooks, gave his head-teacher lunch money for a month, bought him 2 uniforms, and paid for a tutor for one month.  This is where my support for Ebrima stopped.  I know he needed more but I am not able to provide it.  What he needs is not really all that much but unfortunately, more than I can give.  His English is much better, both written in verbal, after one year.  I have such a respect for Ebrima's persistence and demeanor that I want to be able to give him this opportunity.  </p>
<p>The situations with the two boys are nearly the same.  These numbers are not exact but good representations of how your donations will be spent.</p>

<p><strong><br/></strong>If the project is overfunded, the difference will be used to purchase a bike for Lamin, increase lunch money (d5 buys half a bread with chocolate, think half a baguette with nutella), and extend the tutoring to 9 months out of the year.  </p>
<p>Thank you in advance for taking the time to read these boys stories.  If you are unable to contribute financially, sharing this with your friends, family, acquantances, and colleagues via word of mouth, social media, or email is an equally important contribution to the cause.  </p>

If the project is overfunded, the difference will be used to purchase a bike for Lamin, increase lunch money (d5 buys half a bread with chocolate, think half a baguette with nutella), and extend the tutoring to 9 months out of the year.  
Thank you in advance for taking the time to read these boys stories.  If you are unable to contribute financially, sharing this with your friends, family, acquantances, and colleagues via word of mouth, social media, or email is an equally important contribution to the cause.

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Jackie! I work full time for Knox County in Knoxville, TN. I love to sew so that is what I do in my spare time! My mom started teaching me to sew when I was 9 and I haven't stopped!</p>
<p>Last year I was asked by One Vision Intl. to go on a mission trip to Haiti to begin a sewing project with the girls living in an orphanage. I went on the trip and spent three days working with the girls, teaching them how to use sewing machines and preparing them to learn to make clothing. In Haiti, sewing skills could change a girl's life.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because it will help me get back to Haiti and the girls who are anxiously awaiting our arrival.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The cost of the trip is $1,600. This cost covers airfare, lodging and transportation in Haiti, and security.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>So What Do You Get?!</h3>
<p>As a thank-you for your contributions, there are a few<em><strong> AWESOME PERKS</strong> </em>involved! For a contribution of $10, you will receive a personalized thank-you and picture of the sewing project! For contribution of $12, you will receive a personalized thank-you and hand-made fabric keychain. For your contribution of $20, you will provide a girl in the orphanage with a handmade pillowcase dress and you will receive a personalized thank-you with a picture of the girl who received your gift. For a contribution of $25, you will receive a personalized thank-you and a handmade wristlet (large enough to hold cash, cards, and cell phone). For a contribution of $50, you will receive a personalized thank-you and handmade purse. For contributions of $100 or more, you will receive a personalized thank-you, a handmade purse and wristlet, as well as supply a girl in the orphanage with a new dress.</p>
<p>For those who want to give outside of the US:I will not be able to send any items due to high shipping costs.  I will send you pictures via email if you request them </p>
<p>If I receive more than my goal amount, the money will go toward supplies for the sewing project.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The sewing project in Haiti will have a great impact in the lives of these girls. A lot of children in orphanages in Haiti do have families. These families were unable to provide the basic necessities for survival and opted to give up their children so that they had a chance for life.</p>
<p>This project is not about handing out freebies. Our goal is to simply walk along the side of these girls through life teaching them a skill. This skill will hopefully lead to a self-sufficient life. These girls will be able to provide for their future families.</p>
<p>I have the opportunity to make a return trip to Haiti in April. The girls are waiting for our return and asking to learn how to make pants and blouses with buttons! With your help, I will return in April to see my girls!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not everyone is in a position to help out financially, but that's okay! Please, if you can, spread the word. Tell friends, family, post this site on facebook, show someone a photo of the girls, do an interpretive dance explaining the cause - whatever you feel to help get the word out there. You never know who of your friends may feel inclined to donate!</p>

basis – dance parties, burlesque shows, board game nights, art exhibits, neighborhood
festivals – but without a local weekly to act as a clearinghouse for all these
events, it can be hard to connect.Over the last five years we’ve
expanded Apt613 beyond the blog to include a radio show, a lecture series and
our yearly Support Local Campaign. We’ve grown from a team of seven to over fifty

<p>On
Friday march 7<sup>th</sup> 2014, we received <b>“the phone call”</b> that no one
should ever receive for a member of their family, specially, the youngest one.</p>
<p>23
year old Ricardy, also known as Ricky, Rickbo…etc…, suffered a tragic and unimaginable
death.</p>
<p>4
years prior Ricky survived a life-threatening shooting.
After overcoming the possibility of being paralyzed along with death itself,
Ricky was finally getting his life back together.  Overall, he wanted to fulfill his parents and
brothers dreams and expectations of him while keeping his boys (“homies”) happy.  In the family, we know sometime we were tough
on him because of the expectations and the examples he had to follow: “both of his
older brothers got here in this country the same day that he did, both
graduated from college with their Master’s degree in Accounting and Engineering
respectively. Neither one has ever been in trouble.  People look at them as role models (success
stories) for any family coming in this country”.  So, we understand the pressure that was on
Ricky and we can tell sometime that bothered him a lot because he never received
the proper credit for doing well in school or for trying to follow the right
path.</p>
<p>After
graduating from Palm Beach State College with an AA degree and an overall GPA
of over 3.0, Ricky was accepted to both Florida State University (FSU) and
Florida Atlantic University (FAU).  Ricky
chooses FAU in order to follow his brothers’ footsteps.  Looking through his Facebook page the past
few days, we realized how much impact his life had in the community especially
for his friends.  To some, Ricky was a
role model, a brother, a friend (loyal and compassionate), a student /
classmate on his way to obtaining his master’s degree or PHD, if he wanted to
please and impress his dad particularly, in Physical Therapy.  While on this journey to success, Ricky was
repeatedly and brutally stabbed to death, a devastation that no one was
prepared for.</p>
<p>We are now
asking anyone who has been touched or impacted by Ricky’s life and death in one
way or another to please lend us a helping hand in reaching our short term goal.</p>
<p>Our
short term goal is raise $20,000 to help with funeral and burial expenses for
Ricky. Together, we can finally send Ricky and his tired body home to rest in
peace.</p>
<p>Long
term we hope to establish a scholarship or some type of fund to help educate
and fight violent crime in our community. These Stupidities and Non sense acts
have to stop.  Look at how they are
treating our community, our people, our kids (Haitians) as savages. As we
mourning Ricky’s death, we will find a positive way to celebrate his short life
on hearth and help many from suffering the same fate.  </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>For
those who knew Ricky well, you all knew him for his flashy wardrobe and his
exclusive sneakers: LeBron’s, Foams, polo’s etc. To show our gratitude for the donations
and to share Ricky’s memories with you we are giving away at least 5 of his
sneakers signed by the members of family to the 5 most generous Donors. We also
are thinking about other memorabilia’s; for example: Gold or Silver necklaces,
earing, dog tags with Ricky’s original fingerprint, t-shirts, hats… etc.)
Please contact any member of the family for more information.</p>

Nous
sommes un poste de huit pionniers de la 48eme (jeunes adultes de 16 à
18 ans) encadrés par deux animateurs adultes. Nous faisons partie du
mouvement de jeunesse LES SCOUTS en Belgique. Comme chaque année,
nous organisons un grand camp de juillet sous l'égide d'un projet
d'entraide et de solidarité.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Cette
année nous avons opté pour un projet humanitaire destiné aux
enfants gravement malades. 
</p>
<p>
D'une
part, nous voyagerons à travers cinq pays d'Europe où nous
consacrerons notre temps à l'animation et l'aide aux enfants dans le
besoin ainsi qu'aux associations sociales locales. 
</p>
<p>
D'autre
part, nous lançons cette page de financement participatif dans
l'espoir de venir en aide financièrement à Kelly, une petite fille
atteinte d'une maladie grave en Belgique. Nous lançons cette
démarche en partenariat avec MAKE A WISH-BELGIUM South qui s'occupe de
réaliser les voeux des enfants malades. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Durant
tout notre voyage n'hésitez pas à nous suivre sur TWITTER,
INSTAGRAM et FACEBOOK. Vous y découvrirez nos activités, nos
rencontres, nos échanges... 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Notre
voyage sera notre moyen de nous engager tangiblement pour aider ceux
qui en ont besoin. C'est notre manière d'être crédible face à
ceux qui souhaiteraient nous aider à financer le voeu de Kelly. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<b>Pourquoi
un projet de grand camp ?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Faire
partie d'un mouvement comme le scoutisme, c'est s'engager à défendre
des valeurs et une vision du monde. Au sein d'une unité scoute, nous
tentons de vivre sous l'égide de la confiance, de la solidarité et
de l'écoute des uns et des autres. 
</p>
<p>
Décider
d'opter pour un projet de camp demande une réflexion qui puisse
allier nos convictions collectives, nos ambitions, notre intégrité
personnelle et notre identité de groupe. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
En
tant qu'animateur pionnier, j'ai toujours été légèrement en
colère envers ces projets de camp qui ne respectaient aucune valeur
de groupe mais répondaient « simplement » au besoin de
légitimé d'un voyage de fin d'année. Reconstruire un château qui
tombe en ruine dans le sud de la France, par exemple, est d'une aide
précieuse pour le patrimoine national d'un pays et permet au poste
pionnier de faire partie d'un acte de solidarité. Ce type de projet
répond pleinement aux « conditions » qui font que nous
faisons partie d'un mouvement de jeunesse ; mais en quoi cela
est-il légitime et cohérent avec l'identité même du groupe si
aucun des jeunes et aucun des animateurs ne se sent concerné par les
châteaux, le patrimoine architectural, l'entreprenariat ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Il
était donc important pour nous de pouvoir répondre aussi bien à
notre engagement scout qu'à nos valeurs personnelles et collectives,
nous plaçant au centre de nos convictions les plus intimes. Rien de
mieux, il me semble, pour se sentir stimulé et cohérent. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<b>Les
raisons de notre projet ?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Très
vite, nous avons compris vouloir nous créer un projet de camp qui
puisse représenter au mieux notre génération ainsi que l’essence
même du scoutisme : l'animation et l'engagement. D'autant plus
quand la majorité des pionniers souhaitent devenir animateurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
D'une
part, nous voulons apporter un bienfait réel et tangible à la
société ; nous placer au plus proche de l'humain et de ses
enjeux. D'autre part, nous souhaitons pouvoir profiter des moyens de
communication instantanée contemporains comme les réseaux sociaux
(Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest) afin de communiquer au plus
grand nombre instantanément de manière intelligente en réponse au
constant suivant :  nous avons été bercés et nous avons
grandi avec la télé-réalité ou la compétition et les nominations
déterminent les rapports relationnels. Nous avons pu parfois devenir
« accros » à certaines émissions et cela ne nous aura
pas rendus plus intelligents. Aujourd'hui notre volonté est de
tenter d'en tirer les bienfaits et de profiter de cette pratique qui
consiste à s'afficher face au monde pour communiquer un message, une
action positive et engageante. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<b>Notre
projet de grand camp ?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Nous
avons décidé de voyager à travers l'Europe en train. Notre
engagement humanitaire se fera auprès des enfants en difficultés.
Notre ambition, en partenariat avec l’association MAKE A WISH –
BELGIQUE South, est de pouvoir s'engager en tant que scouts et citoyens
avertis des enjeux humains. L'animation pour les enfants en
difficulté sera notre manière de physiquement et tangiblement
s'engager. De plus, nous avons décidé de nous inscrire dans un
projet social plus vaste et financer le voeu d'un enfant malade
belge. L'idée est donc celle d'un camp parrainé (au même titre
qu'une marche parrainée) pour récolter de l'argent en faisant appel
à la solidarité mondiale.</p>
<p>

de rêves, l'enfance est le monde de tous les possibles : devenir
pompier l'espace d'une journée, parcourir le monde à la découverte
des dauphins, vivre la vie d'une star, rencontrer son idole ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Mais
lorsque la maladie frappe, l'enfance bascule, l'équilibre familial
vacille et le bonheur s'estompe. Séjours à l'hôpital, examens
médicaux et traitements font alors partie du quotidien.</p>
<p>
Malgré
la maladie, les rêves continuent d'habiter le coeur des enfants. Ces
rêves, Make-A-Wish® Belgium South a pour mission qu'ils deviennent
réalité.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Pour
l'enfant malade, la réalisation d'un voeu est un moment magique à
double titre. Tout d'abord, parce qu'il va vivre son rêve, bien sûr,
mais également parce qu'il va le partager avec sa famille et ses
amis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Make-A-Wish® Belgium
South donne en effet l'occasion à l'enfant d'être à l'origine de
moments positifs qu'il partage avec ses proches. Ces moments
continuent à vivre dans le coeur des enfants. 
</p>
<p>
Pour
eux, toutes les étincelles d'espoir ou de bonheur sont autant de
soutien pour affronter le quotidien, d'énergies positives pour aider
à une guérison.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Pour
ces bonnes raisons, les bénévoles, les parrains et les donateurs de
Make-A-Wish® Belgium South mettent tout en oeuvre pour exaucer
ces voeux. Nous voudrions faire plus, faire mieux...</p>
<p>
Et
pour cela, nous avons besoin de vous, d'un peu de votre temps, de
votre soutien financier, de votre réseau de connaissances ...</p>

<b>Le
voeu de Kelly ?</b></p>
<p>

Kelly
est une petit fille atteinte d'une maladie grave. Elle aimerait
pouvoir rencontrer son idole : Kevin DE BRUYNE. 
</p>
<p>
Pour
ceux qui ne le connaitraient pas,  Kevin DE BRUYNE est le numéro 7
de l'équipe nationale belge.

</p><p>
En
BELGIQUE, les DIABLES ROUGES sont un véritable phénomène sportif,
social et politique. Leur belle campagne en coupe du monde de
football n'a que confirmé tout le bien que le pays pensait déjà
d'eux. Symboliquement, les DIABLES ROUGES réussissent ce que le
gouvernement belge tente depuis plusieurs années : unir le pays
et les différentes communautés. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Il
était important pour nous de choisir et de soutenir un voeu qui
puisse être en lien avec notre génération et avec notre projet.
Aider une petite fille à rencontrer son idole suffit à légitimer
notre engagement. Mais celui-ci est encore plus juste quand il
englobe des valeurs de solidarité, de fraternité et d'union comme
le fait l'enseigne des DIABLES ROUGES. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<b>A
quoi servira votre argent ?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Quand
un enfant est soutenu par MAKE A WISH Belgium South, le voeu englobe toute une
série de frais. 
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>
	Un
	voeu n'est jamais celui d'un seul enfant mais celui de toute sa
	famille. MAKE A WISH Belgium South permet à l'enfant de vivre son rêve entouré
	de ses parents, de ses frères et de ses soeurs...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Lors
	d'une rencontre avec une star comme  Kevin DE BRUYNE, MAKE A WISH
Belgium South	offre toute la panoplie d'accessoires permettant à l'enfant de
	garder des souvenirs tangibles. Comme le maillot de foot, la
	casquette... 
	</p>

<li>
<p>
	Pour
	tous les voeux ,MAKE A WISH Belgium South engage une assurance extrêmement
	détaillée.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Pour
	que le voeu de Kelly se passe dans les meilleurs conditions, MAKE A
	WISH Belgium South organise une mise en scène et un événement marquant afin de
	sacraliser la rencontre avec  Kevin DE BRUYNE. Il s'agira
	probablement d'un match de l'équipe nationale belge
	ou du club de Kevin DE BRUYNE (WOLSBURG en ALLEMAGNE) et d'un diner
	au restaurant. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Bien

<b>Nos
motivations :</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Voyager
fait partie des grands souhaits d'un poste pionnier. A la recherche
de nouvelles rencontres, de nouvelles cultures, de nouveaux
paysages... Voyager en groupe entre amis est d'autant plus gratifiant
et exaltant. 
</p>
<p>
Notre
volonté de vivre un projet de camp comme celui-là s'inscrit aussi
dans le désir de formation des pionniers, c'est-à-dire dans leur
envie de devenir animateurs. Des animateurs avertis et désireux
d'expériences hors du commun. Nous avons conscience que le public
que nous visiterons durant notre camp sera un public défavorisé
nous renvoyant en partie à une forme d'impuissance. Cependant, c'est
peut-être aussi de cette manière-là que nous pouvons nous rendre
les plus utiles. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Le
groupe se montre très ouvert et très motivé à l'idée de se
confronter à une autre réalité, à une réalité issue d'une autre
culture et d'une langue différente. Opter pour ce genre de projet
représente pour nous le meilleur moyen de devenir de meilleurs êtres
humains. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
La
communication de masse à-travers les réseaux sociaux est aussi l'un
de nos objectifs : utiliser à bon escient la technologie pour
une « noble » cause.

Pourquoi
un projet de grand camp ?


Faire

tentons de vivre sous l'égide de la confiance, de la solidarité et
de l'écoute des uns et des autres. 


Décider

En
tant qu'animateur pionnier, j'ai toujours été légèrement en

s'engager. De plus, nous avons décidé de nous inscrire dans un
projet social plus vaste et financer le voeu d'un enfant malade
belge. L'idée est donc celle d'un camp parrainé (au même titre
qu'une marche parrainée) pour récolter de l'argent en faisant appel
à la solidarité mondiale.


Où
allons-nous ?


Nous
voyagerons à travers la SLOVENIE, la HONGRIE, la SLOVAQUIE et la
REPUBLIQUE TCHEQUE.


A LJUBLJANA: 	Nous irons animer et soutenir un camp de vacances  pour 			enfants atteint de maladies cérébrales.MARIBOR: Nous irons animer et soutenir des enfants handicapés physiques. 

BUDAPEST :	Nous irons animer et soutenir une association à
BUDAPEST s'occupant 				d'enfant aveugles et malvoyants.

BRATISLAVA :	Nous irons animer et soutenir une association à
BRATISLAVA s'occupant 				d'enfants victimes de problèmes moteurs.PRAGUE: Nous irons animer et soutenir une association à PRAGUE s'occupant d'enfant durant les congés scolaires. 



MAKE
A WISH ?

Peuplée
de rêves, l'enfance est le monde de tous les possibles : devenir
pompier l'espace d'une journée, parcourir le monde à la découverte
des dauphins, vivre la vie d'une star, rencontrer son idole ...


Mais
lorsque la maladie frappe, l'enfance bascule, l'équilibre familial
vacille et le bonheur s'estompe. Séjours à l'hôpital, examens
médicaux et traitements font alors partie du quotidien.

Malgré
la maladie, les rêves continuent d'habiter le coeur des enfants. Ces
rêves, Make-A-Wish® Belgium South a pour mission qu'ils deviennent
réalité.


Pour
l'enfant malade, la réalisation d'un voeu est un moment magique à
double titre. Tout d'abord, parce qu'il va vivre son rêve, bien sûr,
mais également parce qu'il va le partager avec sa famille et ses
amis.


Make-A-Wish® Belgium
South donne en effet l'occasion à l'enfant d'être à l'origine de
moments positifs qu'il partage avec ses proches. Ces moments
continuent à vivre dans le coeur des enfants. 


Pour
eux, toutes les étincelles d'espoir ou de bonheur sont autant de
soutien pour affronter le quotidien, d'énergies positives pour aider
à une guérison.


Pour
ces bonnes raisons, les bénévoles, les parrains et les donateurs de
Make-A-Wish® Belgium South mettent tout en oeuvre pour exaucer
ces voeux. Nous voudrions faire plus, faire mieux...

Et
pour cela, nous avons besoin de vous, d'un peu de votre temps, de
votre soutien financier, de votre réseau de connaissances ...


Le
voeu de Kelly ?


Kelly
est une petit fille atteinte d'une maladie grave. Elle aimerait
pouvoir rencontrer son idole : Kevin DE BRUYNE. 


Pour
ceux qui ne le connaitraient pas,  Kevin DE BRUYNE est le numéro 7
de l'équipe nationale belge. 




En
BELGIQUE, les DIABLES ROUGES sont un véritable phénomène sportif,
social et politique. Leur belle campagne en coupe du monde de
football n'a que confirmé tout le bien que le pays pensait déjà
d'eux. Symboliquement, les DIABLES ROUGES réussissent ce que le
gouvernement belge tente depuis plusieurs années : unir le pays
et les différentes communautés. 



Il
était important pour nous de choisir et de soutenir un voeu qui
puisse être en lien avec notre génération et avec notre projet.
Aider une petite fille à rencontrer son idole suffit à légitimer
notre engagement. Mais celui-ci est encore plus juste quand il
englobe des valeurs de solidarité, de fraternité et d'union comme
le fait l'enseigne des DIABLES ROUGES. 



A
quoi servira votre argent ?


Quand
un enfant est soutenu par MAKE A WISH Belgium South, le voeu englobe toute une
série de frais. 





	Un
	voeu n'est jamais celui d'un seul enfant mais celui de toute sa
	famille. MAKE A WISH Belgium South permet à l'enfant de vivre son rêve entouré
	de ses parents, de ses frères et de ses soeurs...



	Lors
	d'une rencontre avec une star comme  Kevin DE BRUYNE, MAKE A WISH
Belgium South	offre toute la panoplie d'accessoires permettant à l'enfant de
	garder des souvenirs tangibles. Comme le maillot de foot, la
	casquette... 
	



	Pour
	tous les voeux ,MAKE A WISH Belgium South engage une assurance extrêmement
	détaillée.



	Pour
	que le voeu de Kelly se passe dans les meilleurs conditions, MAKE A
	WISH Belgium South organise une mise en scène et un événement marquant afin de
	sacraliser la rencontre avec  Kevin DE BRUYNE. Il s'agira
	probablement d'un match de l'équipe nationale belge
	ou du club de Kevin DE BRUYNE (WOLSBURG en ALLEMAGNE) et d'un diner
	au restaurant. 
	



	Bien
	sur, il va de soit que les frais de déplacement sont assez couteux
	dans la mesure où MAKE A WISH Belgium South assure un confort irréprochable pour
	Kelly.  
	


Nos
motivations :


Voyager
fait partie des grands souhaits d'un poste pionnier. A la recherche
de nouvelles rencontres, de nouvelles cultures, de nouveaux
paysages... Voyager en groupe entre amis est d'autant plus gratifiant
et exaltant. 


Notre
volonté de vivre un projet de camp comme celui-là s'inscrit aussi
dans le désir de formation des pionniers, c'est-à-dire dans leur
envie de devenir animateurs. Des animateurs avertis et désireux
d'expériences hors du commun. Nous avons conscience que le public
que nous visiterons durant notre camp sera un public défavorisé
nous renvoyant en partie à une forme d'impuissance. Cependant, c'est
peut-être aussi de cette manière-là que nous pouvons nous rendre
les plus utiles. 



Le
groupe se montre très ouvert et très motivé à l'idée de se
confronter à une autre réalité, à une réalité issue d'une autre
culture et d'une langue différente. Opter pour ce genre de projet
représente pour nous le meilleur moyen de devenir de meilleurs êtres
humains. 



La
communication de masse à-travers les réseaux sociaux est aussi l'un
de nos objectifs : utiliser à bon escient la technologie pour
une « noble » cause.

<h2>WHAT WE NEED</h2>
<p>It takes thousands of dollars
  to host a Pride Festival. We are asking our community to support our efforts in
  making this the best festival yet! We are looking to raise $15,000+ between now
and our “Free to be You” Pride Festival and Equality Celebration in September.</p>
<h2>WHY WE NEED THE COMMUNITY'S SUPPORT</h2>
<p>Sedona/Verde Valley Pride is a
Non-Profit 501(c)(3) organization. All of the money we use to hold our events
each year comes in from your generous donations and sponsorships from local and
corporate businesses. In order for us to maintain our mission of educating the
whole Verde Valley on issues affecting our LGBT friends, family and neighbors,
we must maintain our visibility in the community and we do so with our Annual
Pride Festival in September.  Without the
support of the community and sponsors, Pride would not exist in Sedona or the
Verde Valley.</p>
<h2>HOW WE’LL USE YOUR DONATION </h2>
<p>Every year we must rent the
tents, tables, chairs, a dance floor and sound equipment to make the festival
enjoyable for everyone. With more vending options, more entertainment and more
events scheduled than ever before, we need the money to pay for equipment
rentals, food &amp; drinks for our events and for marketing &amp; advertising
purposes. Your money pays our entertainers, your money helps fund the rentals,
your money helps us organize and make our vision a reality. Every dime raised
between now and September 25<sup>th</sup> goes toward this year’s festival.</p>

<p>Jacksonville, Florida does
not currently have an organizational system in place to be able to serve the
amount of underprivileged students in the area. Currently, there are 127,085
students in Jacksonville, FL that do not receive arts education. There is a
great demand to meet the needs of the remaining students. For example, one of
the largest arts education organizations, Cathedral Arts Project, only serves
2,000 students. Arts education dwindled after the economic recession, creating
a surplus of underprivileged students without access to arts education
opportunities. JAMS would tap in to that target market, filling the standing
void. No one organization can tackle the number of students throughout
Jacksonville that are in need of arts education but with the introduction of
JAMS, student exposure to the arts in Jacksonville will be increased with every
student who walks through our doors.</p>
<p>I picked JAMS as my final
project because of my passionate belief in the need of increased arts education
in inner city Jacksonville. My commitment to JAMS has spanned nearly a year and
after meeting with numerous parties on the matter I realize the extent of the
need. The initial stages of the organization are prepped and ready to go, I am
dedicated to see this project through, JAMS will one day open its doors. I feel
that if the board gives me the chance to put my plan into action, they will not
be disappointed but will be proud to play a part in helping kick start the
early stages of one of the best arts organizations in Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<p>I have defined the need not
only by data but also by talking to the police department, who have helped me
identify two hot spot areas of major lack of resources for youth.  One in
north Moncrief Rd. and Soutel Dr., and one in District Seven area in the square
comprised of Talleyrand Ave, 8<sup>th</sup> St., North Liberty and The

heart of District Seven, many people have implored to me the overwhelming need for after
school help. This is a huge area of need not only for after school help with
homework, but also exposing children to the arts. My experience at working for
Cathedral Arts Project as Program Coordinator gives me great insight into the
needs of students, schools and communities as well as the programming knowledge

<h3>What happens if the goal is not met?</h3>While there is the possibility that this goal will not be met, I still plan on using any and all received funds to cover the listed points above. I am not one to spend frivolously. I am extremely particular on budgeting and long-term planning.

Items of that nature will be purchased with money saved up after I have fully established myself in Syracuse.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<h3>What do you get for contributing?</h3>
<div>There is a very large variety of perks that are available to you as a thanks for contributing!! The very lowest-tier and simplest perk is a personalized, well-thought-out, and hand-written letter from me thanking you for all of your support. Additional things such as pictures, t-shirts, and stickers are added throughout the different tiers corresponding to the donation amounts. <br/><br/>The higher-tiered perks include a personal, guided video tour of my favorite places around Syracuse, including certain areas of campus; a personalized visualization and creation of your favorite piece of music, as seen through the eyes of a synesthete; and best of all, your very own commission of a piece from me! As a composer, I'm <i>always</i> looking for new material; and, now you can help!! With these four-highest perks, you can actually see your donations dollars at-work. All you have to do is email me what sort of group you want to perform, and what you want the piece to sound like. Additional details are listed in the perk explanation and you will receive your very own signed copy of the score and a recording. <b>NOTE:</b> Making a recording is not free; and therefore, your donation will go towards getting a recording made especially for you!! <br/><br/>All of the perks are inclusive; by which I mean, when choosing a higher-tiered perk, you will also receive the perks of any/all lower-tiered perks up to that donation level. <b>NOTE:</b> All commissions will include the perks until the $100 donation as I will not write 4 different pieces for someone if he/she donates $1000. <b>ALSO: </b>Any commission recipients will still receive a Synesthesia Visualization, so be sure to include your song-of-choice for that as well. <br/><br/>

<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In the past, I have been the recipient of the Jefferson County McCormick Scholarship that provides full-payment for tuition, room/board, and textbooks. I was able to maintain and adequately budget that money throughout my entire undergraduate career. I also received the WV Promise Scholarship (tuition) as well as the Federal Pell Grant and the WV Higher Education Grant. All of which were put towards expenses such as a complete cleaning and mechanic overhaul on my clarinet and the printing of all scores and parts for my senior composition recital.<br/><br/></span></span>
</h3>
</div><div> <h3>Do I have to contribute money?</h3>
<div>No! Not at all!! If you just wish to express your emotional support towards this new step in my life, it is greatly appreciated!! If you would like to donate any items towards my education (such as office supplies) or new apartment (such as odds and ends like dishes or towels), that's super cool too! This campaign is simply to put my plans out there with the help of anyone and everyone willing to see this next step in my career become a success.<br/><br/>

</h3>
<h3>Can I share this campaign information with my friends &amp; family?<br/>
</h3>
<div>Absolutely!! Feel free to spread the information about this campaign as far and wide as you'd like!! I am not opposed to receiving messages from someone I've never met, half-way around the world, interested in hearing the music I have to offer and seeing that I am able to make more of it!! It is possible to share this campaign through Facebook, on Twitter, and even just copy/pasting the link wherever you like.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><h3>Can I share your story &amp; information with my friends &amp; family?</h3>Most definitely!! I love meeting new people and learning about their stories, their experiences, their education, and most of all their talents! As such, I have no problem what-so-ever with wanting to share that with anyone else who's interested and willing to listen. Even if you don't want to contribute, but want to spread the news about the work I do, that is supportive in itself and extremely appreciated!!</span></div>

There is a very large variety of perks that are available to you as a thanks for contributing!! The very lowest-tier and simplest perk is a personalized, well-thought-out, and hand-written letter from me thanking you for all of your support. Additional things such as pictures, t-shirts, and stickers are added throughout the different tiers corresponding to the donation amounts. The higher-tiered perks include a personal, guided video tour of my favorite places around Syracuse, including certain areas of campus; a personalized visualization and creation of your favorite piece of music, as seen through the eyes of a synesthete; and best of all, your very own commission of a piece from me! As a composer, I'm always looking for new material; and, now you can help!! With these four-highest perks, you can actually see your donations dollars at-work. All you have to do is email me what sort of group you want to perform, and what you want the piece to sound like. Additional details are listed in the perk explanation and you will receive your very own signed copy of the score and a recording. NOTE: Making a recording is not free; and therefore, your donation will go towards getting a recording made especially for you!! All of the perks are inclusive; by which I mean, when choosing a higher-tiered perk, you will also receive the perks of any/all lower-tiered perks up to that donation level. NOTE: All commissions will include the perks until the $100 donation as I will not write 4 different pieces for someone if he/she donates $1000. ALSO: Any commission recipients will still receive a Synesthesia Visualization, so be sure to include your song-of-choice for that as well. 


  How can I trust my donation will be used properly?

In the past, I have been the recipient of the Jefferson County McCormick Scholarship that provides full-payment for tuition, room/board, and textbooks. I was able to maintain and adequately budget that money throughout my entire undergraduate career. I also received the WV Promise Scholarship (tuition) as well as the Federal Pell Grant and the WV Higher Education Grant. All of which were put towards expenses such as a complete cleaning and mechanic overhaul on my clarinet and the printing of all scores and parts for my senior composition recital.

 Do I have to contribute money?
No! Not at all!! If you just wish to express your emotional support towards this new step in my life, it is greatly appreciated!! If you would like to donate any items towards my education (such as office supplies) or new apartment (such as odds and ends like dishes or towels), that's super cool too! This campaign is simply to put my plans out there with the help of anyone and everyone willing to see this next step in my career become a success.



Can I share this campaign information with my friends & family?

Absolutely!! Feel free to spread the information about this campaign as far and wide as you'd like!! I am not opposed to receiving messages from someone I've never met, half-way around the world, interested in hearing the music I have to offer and seeing that I am able to make more of it!! It is possible to share this campaign through Facebook, on Twitter, and even just copy/pasting the link wherever you like.

Can I share your story & information with my friends & family?Most definitely!! I love meeting new people and learning about their stories, their experiences, their education, and most of all their talents! As such, I have no problem what-so-ever with wanting to share that with anyone else who's interested and willing to listen. Even if you don't want to contribute, but want to spread the news about the work I do, that is supportive in itself and extremely appreciated!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I am Helen Howard,

and helping other people to grow their own snails at home. As a teacher I believe it is vital for

Baby snails are
very engaging, even if they are not on your list of favourite animals because

exhibited by young graduates and new entrants into the Nigerian labour
market and were compelled to find a solution. </p>
<p>The Bridge aims to address these
shortcomings—workforce incompetence, unethical leadership and unemployment—by
training of the youth and encouraging job creation by the youth. The Bridge
seeks to groom, empower and inspire young adults to strive for excellence and
achieve self-actualisation. The program is positioned to help participants
attain global professional competency, become contenders for impactful career
opportunities and leadership roles and become entrepreneurs that create job in
their communities. </p>
<p>Our vision is to see a socially,
economically and politically prosperous Nigeria driven by Ethical leaders. Our
success will be to transform participants into young leaders who will ensure
the socio, cultural, economic and political landscape they inhabit is affected
positively and ultimately altered permanently by their presence and decisions.
We will equip and motivate these young leaders to identify and maximize their
full potential as catalysts for change and growth. Our mandate is to ensure the
actualisation of leadership potential, innovation and professionalism in our
participants’ career and entrepreneurial endeavours. We truly believe the

<h3><b>HISTORY</b></h3>
<p>Major Nathaniel Cheairs built the Greek Revival brick structure on
property originally purchased by his father in 1811. The current rear wing was the original
two-story house and detached smokehouse which was constructed before the main house and was occupied by the Cheairs family until
the main house was completed in 1855. Afterwards, it was used as a kitchen and
living quarters for slaves and servants. The Cheairs family enjoyed a few peaceful years before the Civil War
began. <br/></p>
<p>The Battle of Spring Hill brought the Civil War to
Rippavilla. On the morning of November 30, 1864, General John Bell Hood ordered
his subordinate commanders to meet him at Rippavilla for a meeting before
proceeding to Franklin.
The meeting, also referred to as Hood’s War council breakfast, occurred in the
dining room after being served coffee, ham and biscuits by Mrs. Cheairs. Rippavilla was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July
19, 1996 for historic significance, <br/></p>
</div> <div>
<p></p>
<h3>CURRENTLY<br/>
</h3>
<p>In addition to being a non-traditional educational setting
for local schools, Rippavilla is a tourist destination for vacationers and tour
bus groups. For the past ten years, tourism has been and continues to be one of
the top five economic drivers in Middle Tennessee and Rippavilla’s role in
local tourism enables Maury County to compete with surrounding counties and
attract this stream of tax revenue. </p>
<p>Rippavilla sponsors a Boy Scout Troop and a Girl Scout Troop
as part of its community outreach. Both troops are allowed to meet and camp on
the site’s 89 acres. </p>
Throughout the last 18 years, Rippavilla, Inc and the board of directors
 have worked diligently to become good financial stewards of this 
stately antebellum mansion. As a 501(c)(3) non-profit we do not receive 
any financial help from local, state or federal governments. There have 
been varied fundraisers throughout the years, corn maze, bridal fairs, vintage 
marketplace, paranormal investigations, Civil War reenactments, etc to 
raise the much needed funds. Due to the age of the house, 159 years 
old, and the cost to maintain the house and property the fundraisers 
have not been able to provide enough monetary gain for the necessary 
repairs.<br/><br/><h3>
<b>NEEDS</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>On the rear wing, the existing metal
standing seam roof and metal gutters were installed the early 1900s (some
research indicates both roof and gutters were installed in 1914) have rusted
throughout the years allowing rain to leak into the interior. As a result,
interior plaster damage ($2,025) is apparent in the original kitchen. Repairs to the roof ($9,050) and gutters ($2,750) are of
vital importance as to prevent moisture from creating exterior structural
damage to the bricks and mortar and the interior plaster.</p>
<p>On the main house, a new copper roof and flashing were
installed in 1996, when Rippavilla, Inc was incorporated, but through the years the flashing joints have eroded
allowing moisture to enter the interior walls and ceiling of the original
dining room gradually break downing the plaster resulting in bits of plaster
falling on the furnishings and floor.</p>Repairing the flashing on the connecting hallway roof ($350) and
plaster in the dining room of the mansion ($3,500) is of vital importance as to prevent
further damage to the plaster and the original wood lath supporting the
plaster. If the flashing is not repaired, moisture could begin to damage the
exterior brick wall and mortar potentially resulting in structural damage.
Also, the walls and ceiling are a very visible part of our tours as well as
part of the area used for fundraising dinners. <br/><br/>The home has 60 shuttered windows that were originally hung in the 1950's. The shutters were repaired in 2004 by local Amish carpenters but have begun to deteriorate again due to weather. Some shutters on the south and west side of the home have fallen off completely and shutters on other sides have started to lose slats. The cost for new historically accurate shutters is $30,000 for all 60 windows.<br/><p></p>

</h3><p>I am a Junior at the University of
Hawaii Maui College and have been nominated to represent the United States, my university
and my community as a member of the International Scholar Laureate Program (ISLP)
Delegation on May 27, 2014 through June 9, 2014 in China.</p>
<p>ISLP nominates exceptional college
and university students from around the country to this experiential
educational program. I have enclosed a sample of our itinerary for your review.
As you can see, this will be a powerful experience, enabling me to interact
with many prominent men and women in engineering and technology.</p>
<p>Attending this program will
challenge me to develop my leadership skills and reach my career goals of
becoming an engineer with a focus on energy management and efficiency. I am
focusing on my liberal arts degree right now and plan to graduate in 2015 with
goals to continue on to electrical engineering at University of Hawaii Manoa campus. I maintain a 3.91 GPA,
am involved in training other students in energy auditing and was recently
awarded certifications in Energy Management and Production, Home Energy Surveying
and Commercial Energy Auditing.</p>
<p>Imagine if you had been given this
opportunity for a life changing experience when you were in college and were
unable to participate for lack of funds. The program cost including tuition and
travel will exceed $8,000. I am investing every dollar I can of my own money to
make sure I don’t miss out on this once‐in‐a‐lifetime experience.<span>  I currently work full time at Mana Foods as a
produce clerk, part time for Green Building Hawaii as an energy consultant and
go to school part time in order to support my education and live here in Maui. <br/></span></p><p><span>If you want to know what your money will be contributing to I have attached a copy of all the activities I will be able to be a part of due to your financial support.  If you don't want to contribute through my Indiegogo site you can join me at Flatbread Paia on April 22nd, Earth day, for a fund raiser and silent auction.  <br/></span></p><p><br/><span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>International
Scholar Laureate Program Delegation Itinerary to China</p>
<p></p>
<p>The International Scholar Laureate Program (ISLP) Delegation on Engineering
&amp; Technology in China will provide you with access to the people, places
and perspectives at the core of the engineering powerhouse that is today’s
China. </p>
<p>Through special access to engineering marvels, lectures by top engineers and
government officials, exciting activities, group discussions and immersion in
the sights, sounds, people and places that make up this exotic land, you will
return with not only a new perspective on China, but also on the future of
engineering and the role you want to play in it.</p>
<p><b>Beijing</b></p>
<p><b>Cultural
Excursions included in the Program:</b></p>
<p><b>Tian’anmen
Square</b> is the political heart of modern China. At 100 acres, it is
the largest public square in the world. Known as the site of massive student
protests, it is the entry point to the Forbidden City. The square features
famous monuments including the Gate of Heavenly Peace and the mausoleum of
former Chinese ruler Mao Zedong.</p>
<p>China’s
former imperial palace, the <b>Forbidden City</b>, has been home to a long line
of emperors, from Yongle in 1420 through Puyi in 1924. The political center of
Chinese government for five centuries, it now houses the <b>Palace Museum</b>,
which contains the largest collection of imperial artwork and artifacts in the
country.</p>
<p><b>The
Great Wall of China</b> is the world's longest human-made
structure, stretching across approximately 4,500 miles. It is a series of stone
and earthen fortifications constructed and maintained between the 5th century
BC and the 16th century AD. Originally built to keep nomads out of China, it is
today considered a symbol of Chinese unity and is one of the world’s most
recognizable landmarks. The Great Wall was named a UNESCO World Heritage site
in 1987.</p>
<p>Each

Hawaii Maui College and have been nominated to represent the United States, my university
and my community as a member of the International Scholar Laureate Program (ISLP)
Delegation on May 27, 2014 through June 9, 2014 in China.
ISLP nominates exceptional college
and university students from around the country to this experiential
educational program. I have enclosed a sample of our itinerary for your review.
As you can see, this will be a powerful experience, enabling me to interact
with many prominent men and women in engineering and technology.
Attending this program will
challenge me to develop my leadership skills and reach my career goals of
becoming an engineer with a focus on energy management and efficiency. I am
focusing on my liberal arts degree right now and plan to graduate in 2015 with
goals to continue on to electrical engineering at University of Hawaii Manoa campus. I maintain a 3.91 GPA,
am involved in training other students in energy auditing and was recently
awarded certifications in Energy Management and Production, Home Energy Surveying
and Commercial Energy Auditing.
Imagine if you had been given this
opportunity for a life changing experience when you were in college and were
unable to participate for lack of funds. The program cost including tuition and
travel will exceed $8,000. I am investing every dollar I can of my own money to
make sure I don’t miss out on this once‐in‐a‐lifetime experience.  I currently work full time at Mana Foods as a
produce clerk, part time for Green Building Hawaii as an energy consultant and
go to school part time in order to support my education and live here in Maui. If you want to know what your money will be contributing to I have attached a copy of all the activities I will be able to be a part of due to your financial support.  If you don't want to contribute through my Indiegogo site you can join me at Flatbread Paia on April 22nd, Earth day, for a fund raiser and silent auction.

We believe this is a God opportunity to be able to go together for the first time and for the final time as a family in our youth group. We will be doing different types of outreaches and various types of servitude in Jamaica. God's heart is for the widows and the orphans, and that is the heart we intend to share to the people of Jamaica.The Need and The RewardFor us to be able to step foot in Jamaica we must first raise the money to get there. We are asking you to consider making a one-time donation. Your financial contribution,
whatever it may be, will allow God to touch the lives of those who don’t know
the name of Jesus through us. You are not only investing in a mission trip but you are also
investing in an experience with God's heart that is very present in the mission field. The trip costs $1850 per individual, so it will cost $7400 for the four of us. Yikes that's a lot of money, but I know God can work miracles and that anything is possible. We have created different types of perks for any donation so you would feel our gratefulness. Any amount counts and we are grateful. Whatever money is raised we will put it towards our Jamaica trip.*Food will arrive before the photos and thank you notes arrive, once we receive the orders.The ImpactEach day we will work assisting a local church in reaching their city with God’s love. We will be involved in dramas, evangelism, cultural programs, street rallies, children’s ministry and construction.Here is the impact that your donations can bring:

We will be aiding in fixing parts of the orphanage we will be staying at.

We will be involved in various forms of construction.
We will be spending time with children that are motherless and fatherless.
We will be conducting various services to reach people for Jesus. 
You are investing in the hearts of the Jamaicans we will encounter.

You are investing in our experience to gain a heart for the orphans and widows that God has for them.

<h2><strong>(¡Versión en Español abajo!)</strong></h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.riostorivers.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ríos to Rivers</a> was founded by river runners from the Colorado River basin who have grown up with the legacy of the United States’ golden era of dam building.</p>
<p>We’ve teamed up with Club Náutico Escualo, a youth kayaking club from Chilean Patagonia that teaches confidence and self-respect, and fosters a deep connection with local rivers and wilderness. Club Náutico Escualo's home river, the pristine Río Baker, and the nearby Río Pascua are threatened by five mega-dams, similar to those on the Colorado River. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/1003850_1387570781462116_1646016505_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><strong>Club Náutico Escualo, a free youth kayak club that has been teaching kayaking on the remote Rio Baker for the last 14 years.

<p>Time is short, but there’s still a chance to stop the dams. The transmission line needed to deliver the power 2,000 kilometers to Santiago, Chile, hasn’t been approved. 74% of Chileans oppose the dams and the lines.<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/722/963/b625558c7317c2e76c5d4628b05e0ee8_large.jpg?1373043213"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>In August 2013, Ríos to Rivers will lead eight members of Club Náutico Escualo through the Grand Canyon, using the fate of the Colorado River—recently designated the most endangered river in the United States by American Rivers—to show them what it means to dam a river and what is at stake in their home region. This will be the first time the young kayakers will have seen a large dam first hand.</p>

<p>We need your help to complete the exchange and bring eight members of Club Náutico Escualo and their two coaches to the Grand Canyon. They’ll be reunited with their US friends and participate in hands-on scientific projects to learn about the impact of dams on the Colorado.</p>
<p>The exchange is being documented by filmmaker and co-founder Weston Boyles, whose <a href=""http://www.losescualos.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first film about Club Náutico Escualo</a> has screened at film festivals world-wide.</p>

<p>In the same way that few in the United States knew what would be lost when Glen Canyon Dam was built, few Chileans have witnessed the majesty of the Baker and Pascua Rivers. Our film will use the engaging plot of exchange to show Chilean and world audiences the intrinsic value of Patagonia’s rivers, and illustrate why these rivers deserve similar protection as the Grand Canyon. The film will also be a fundraising tool for future exchanges with the goal of cultivating a legacy of exchange and education between the Grand Canyon and Patagonia.   </p>

<p>Ríos to Rivers cofounders Weston Boyles and Susan Munroe and our small team have <strong>volunteered</strong> time, energy, and money over the past two years because we believe that our program has the potential to change lives and influence the future of Patagonia's rivers.</p>

(¡Versión en Español abajo!)
Ríos to Rivers was founded by river runners from the Colorado River basin who have grown up with the legacy of the United States’ golden era of dam building.
We’ve teamed up with Club Náutico Escualo, a youth kayaking club from Chilean Patagonia that teaches confidence and self-respect, and fosters a deep connection with local rivers and wilderness. Club Náutico Escualo's home river, the pristine Río Baker, and the nearby Río Pascua are threatened by five mega-dams, similar to those on the Colorado River.

Time is short, but there’s still a chance to stop the dams. The transmission line needed to deliver the power 2,000 kilometers to Santiago, Chile, hasn’t been approved. 74% of Chileans oppose the dams and the lines.

In August 2013, Ríos to Rivers will lead eight members of Club Náutico Escualo through the Grand Canyon, using the fate of the Colorado River—recently designated the most endangered river in the United States by American Rivers—to show them what it means to dam a river and what is at stake in their home region. This will be the first time the young kayakers will have seen a large dam first hand.

We've Already Completed Half of the Exchange!
In March 2013 we led eight Colorado students to Patagonia, where they met members of the Escualos club (The River Sharks), kayaked the Río Baker, and heard both sides of the debate over the proposed dams in Patagonia. Read more about that adventure here.

We need your help to complete the exchange and bring eight members of Club Náutico Escualo and their two coaches to the Grand Canyon. They’ll be reunited with their US friends and participate in hands-on scientific projects to learn about the impact of dams on the Colorado.
The exchange is being documented by filmmaker and co-founder Weston Boyles, whose first film about Club Náutico Escualo has screened at film festivals world-wide.

In the same way that few in the United States knew what would be lost when Glen Canyon Dam was built, few Chileans have witnessed the majesty of the Baker and Pascua Rivers. Our film will use the engaging plot of exchange to show Chilean and world audiences the intrinsic value of Patagonia’s rivers, and illustrate why these rivers deserve similar protection as the Grand Canyon. The film will also be a fundraising tool for future exchanges with the goal of cultivating a legacy of exchange and education between the Grand Canyon and Patagonia.

$25,000 Will Pay for Five Chilean Students' Trip to Grand Canyon

Bus and plane transportation from the Escualos’ remote Patagonian town to the United States
Visas to enter the United States
Transport and food while in the United States
Travel insurance
12 day kayaking trip through Grand Canyon – supported at a generous discount by Hatch River Expeditions.
We've been fortunate to receive funding from a variety of sources, including the Escualos' home town, which donated $2,500 toward the travel costs associated with the visa application process, but we still need your support. $25,000 is the minimum that we need to make this trip a reality; we need to raise at least $40,000 by the end of 2013 to cover other operational and production costs.
Ríos to Rivers cofounders Weston Boyles and Susan Munroe and our small team have volunteered time, energy, and money over the past two years because we believe that our program has the potential to change lives and influence the future of Patagonia's rivers.

What’s In It For You?
Aside from the satisfaction of helping to create a legacy of exchange between the Grand Canyon and Patagonia, you could receive handwritten thank you cards from the Escualos; DVDs of the finished documentary signed by the filmmakers; an exclusive rafting trip through Westwater Canyon on the Colorado River with Holiday River Expeditions; and more! You could also have your name appear as a co-producer of the entire film!
Ríos to Rivers is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, which means that you also get to deduct your donation from your taxes.

<h3>My Story!</h3>
<p>Hi all! Here's my story! I'm a 24 year old single, independent girl from the USA! I have been offered the chance of a lifetime to venture over seas and teach our language ENGLISH to those students in Thailand! This is an amazing opportunity for myself, the Thai students, and the US! By going to Thailand I will have the chance to obtain my TEFL Certification through a 3 week course and then will go on to be placed somewhere in the country to teach what I know about our language and it's origin and linguistics to those fortunate children!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As mentioned this is an amazing opportunity on so many levels! For myself I am going to gain the experience of another culture. How they live, act, dress, talk, learn, socialize, etc. But even better the lives of innocent and precious children will be greatly and positively impacted by such a program. The students of Thailand will have the opportunity to become exposed to another culture and language, and at such a young age! This exposure to American culture and the English language can help lessen the divides that are sometimes created throughout the globe. As an american citizen it is important that we display american as the land of the free and that we welcome other cultures and nationalities. Portraying such a positive image of american onto these students will encourage cultural diversity and acceptance!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If this adventure is unable to take place it could be a total let down. I know myself that I can not change the world, but as one person I can be a little change that can make a huge difference. Encouraging diversity in other countries can only make the world a better, happier place. Also, exposing such young children to the English language will lessen communication gaps throughout the world and encourage greater communication and collaboration throughout the world!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How you can help make a difference!</h3>
<p>I have suggested a $2,400 campaign goal. This may seem high and with economic times being tough I understand it is hard to find the spare money, but every little bit helps! This amount was determined by factoring the cost of the course and airfare to Thailand. The course to become certified and qualified to spread and teach English to another country itself is over $1,200, but I know that if it can increase diversity and understanding it is worth it!

<p> </p>
<p>Other costs that I am factoring in into this adventure include the cost of maintaining and providing a healthy and happy learning environment for the students.

<p>If I can not reach my goal, I hope to still travel and spread my knowledge and affect on the lives of others. While I am still in college, and have massive student loans already, I will be more than likely taking out another loan to provide the funding for my experience and adventure. This is by no means what I would hope to do, but in order to ensure the success of such an experience, I am willing to go to such lengths. Therefore, I am asking for your help in any way, small or large! It will be greatly appreciated by myself and I am sure my future students!<br/></p>

</div></div>","My Story!
Hi all! Here's my story! I'm a 24 year old single, independent girl from the USA! I have been offered the chance of a lifetime to venture over seas and teach our language ENGLISH to those students in Thailand! This is an amazing opportunity for myself, the Thai students, and the US! By going to Thailand I will have the chance to obtain my TEFL Certification through a 3 week course and then will go on to be placed somewhere in the country to teach what I know about our language and it's origin and linguistics to those fortunate children!



The Impact
As mentioned this is an amazing opportunity on so many levels! For myself I am going to gain the experience of another culture. How they live, act, dress, talk, learn, socialize, etc. But even better the lives of innocent and precious children will be greatly and positively impacted by such a program. The students of Thailand will have the opportunity to become exposed to another culture and language, and at such a young age! This exposure to American culture and the English language can help lessen the divides that are sometimes created throughout the globe. As an american citizen it is important that we display american as the land of the free and that we welcome other cultures and nationalities. Portraying such a positive image of american onto these students will encourage cultural diversity and acceptance!
 
If this adventure is unable to take place it could be a total let down. I know myself that I can not change the world, but as one person I can be a little change that can make a huge difference. Encouraging diversity in other countries can only make the world a better, happier place. Also, exposing such young children to the English language will lessen communication gaps throughout the world and encourage greater communication and collaboration throughout the world!



How you can help make a difference!
I have suggested a $2,400 campaign goal. This may seem high and with economic times being tough I understand it is hard to find the spare money, but every little bit helps! This amount was determined by factoring the cost of the course and airfare to Thailand. The course to become certified and qualified to spread and teach English to another country itself is over $1,200, but I know that if it can increase diversity and understanding it is worth it! Along with the course cost, airfare is quite expensive for the 22 hour travel that will be necessary. Most airlines are asking over $1,400 for round trip airfare. 
 
Other costs that I am factoring in into this adventure include the cost of maintaining and providing a healthy and happy learning environment for the students.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Yoga teachers Nick Manci and Laura Brown have always felt that the people who <strong><em>need</em></strong> yoga and mind-body group classes the most <strong>RARELY get to have access</strong> to them. Since working with underserved populations - and bringing these in-need, at-risk groups to yoga and mind-body classes is where true Seva (service) is found, their new studio in Flagstaff is raising funds to provide class scholarships to in-need populations.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>People who will be receiving scholarships to attend yoga classes and Mind-Body Resilience Training at the all-new Prana Studio on Flagstaff, AZ include but are not limited to:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>At-Risk Youth</li>
<li>Populations recovering from addictions</li>
<li>Formerly incarcerated, reintegrating into society</li>
<li>At risk teens</li>
<li>Women recovering from trauma, abuse &amp; eating disorders</li>
<li>Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans</li>
<li>- and many other groups who need support reintegrating into communities, whether in the form of finding thei purpose, healing trauma, or building resilience.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are basically raising funds to cover our costs - studio space rental and mat space to provide individuals with the opportunity to take classes at no out-of-pocket cost - i.e, scholarships!</li>
<li>We have SO many amazing perks for our donors - including <strong>passes to the Sedona Yoga Festival</strong> (this coming weekend!), passes to the <strong>Flagstaff Yoga festival</strong> (in August), Downloads of Nick's <strong>One Breath Yoga DVDs</strong>, <strong>studio sponsorship</strong>s, and<strong> public class passes</strong> for all the other yoga and MBRT classes happening at Prana Studio - this is <em><strong>THE best deal on all of these passes you will find anywhere!</strong> </em><em><br/></em>
</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, that just means we'll be able to provide a few scholarships rather than hundreds - we'll still use the funds for scholarships, though, so all good :) Every dollar helps - Muchas muchas gracias, everyone!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><em><strong>Mind-Body Resilience Training (MBRT)</strong> has been successfully implemented by Nick Manci with the U.S. Marine Corps, and previous to that his work was taken into prisons in Portland, Oregon - providing men a means to effectively build resilience, release trauma, and re-discover their purpose and their valuable roles as men in their communities.</em> Bringing it to more at-risk and in-need groups to strengthen the community of Flagstaff from the inside out helps everyone!</p>
<p><em>Working with teen mothers and women recovering from eating disorders have been causes that Laura has held dear to her heart since taking her teacher training 7 years' ago.

<p>The Foundation for Human Movement Studies has partnered with Indiegogo to develop a fundraising campaign to develop scholarship support for a week long developmental movement intensive lead by Jeff Tunkey, a graduate of the Spacial Dynamics Institute®. The learning goal of this pedagogical course is to enrich and enliven teaching approaches, starting with the insights of Rudolf Steiner a century ago and then linking these to more recent research and methods including those taught by Jaimen McMillan the founder of the Spacial Dynamics Institute®.  The intensive will examine the foundations of healthy development that occur through movement, and experience how these foundations can be joyfully built through ‘old time’ gym, schoolyard and backyard games once played by children all over the world. Many of these activities are in books for teachers and recreation directors published between 1910 and 1950. The intensive is scheduled for June 23rd 2013 through June 30th , 2013 at the Aurora Waldorf School  near Buffalo, NY.  Each day will include five hours of movement and two hours of supporting pedagogical theory.</p>

<p><strong>A little about Jeff…</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Jeff Tunkey is a graduate of the Spacial Dynamics Institute® IS 3 (class of 1999). Since 1994, Jeff has taught both Physical Education and Extra Lesson at Aurora Waldorf School.  He has also worked with teacher groups through the Association for a Healing Education, the HEART Program in Toronto, and at other Waldorf and public schools. Jeff has worked as an Educational Support Team Coordinator, Faculty Chair and Board President at Aurora Waldorf School, and is a Board member of the Association for a Healing Education.  In addition, Jeff maintains a website that is a resource of movement ideas for teachers and parents at  <a href=""http://www.movementforchildhood.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.movementforchildhood.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you can help us achieve…</strong></p>
<p>In Jeff’s own words: “I began teaching in my mid-40's; I'm now 65. I believe that the curriculum I've built up over the years is one that strengthens students' foundations for learning and for a lifelong appreciation of movement. Before I retire I would like to pass along what I've learned - both the activities and the deeper understanding of their importance for the future of childhood.”</p>
<p>A childhood rich in varied play and movement strengthens the developmental foundations needed for success in the grades and beyond. Through age-appropriate movement, the child gains basics like: postural control; spatial orientation; movement coordination; the ability to change sight perception instantaneously between three-dimensional and two-dimensional space; good body geography; and confirmed dominance. From early childhood through high school, experience has shown that classes of students who are provided with appropriate daily movement activities are able to move ahead more solidly.</p>
<p>If you would like to see more of Jeff’s work, he has posted a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzax9Ztdpjs&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">3-part YouTube video</a> of an all-school circus.

<h3>""Here I am God, Send Me""</h3>
<p>My passoin in life is to reach those who have never heard the gospel. Who knew some 19- year old retail sales/college student woud have an opportunity to go to Australia! I can't believe it either. Going to YWAM I will be definitely taken out of my comfort zone, but I'm okay with that! </p>
<p>What I need:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I need to raise $6,000 by the time I leave July 4, 2013. I will be going to Byron Bay, Australia. I have many fundraisers set in place to help me reach my goal. I need your help as well. Any amount of donations will help! I truly believe God can multiply. ""All things are possible!"" </p>
<p>$2,000- Round trip Plane ticket</p>
<p>$4,000- Outreach phase (That covers my transportaion, living, food, accomodations, ect.)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By giving you're investing not only in my life but also in the Kingdom of God. Anything my team of nine students and I do for the Kingdom, will go towards your treasure in Heaven. </p>
<p>This past summer, I went to India and God went with us! I have several stories but not enough room to write them all. However, I would like to share with you one story while  I was in India. My team of eight and I went to the slum in the very poorest part of Pune to pick up trash. I have never experienced anything like that before the smell, the sight of it, words can't explain. We were touching things that were in some cases unknown to us. The people in the slums and the community couldn't believe we were doing that, some even felt ashamed that the Americans would come to clean up the mess. We wanted to set an example on how Christ wants us to keep not only our homes clean but our hearts also. By the end of the day newspaper reporters came from two stations came and we ended up on the front page of a few newspapers. Because of this testimonial act of service the slums of Pune now have weekly trash pick-ups. Cleaning the slums, a simple act of kindness, has impacted millions of people. Through those newspapers millions were able to see our purpose in going, which was to ""Make God Known."" </p>
<p>If you invested in that trip you will forever be rewarded.  A permanant ministry has now be established in that area.    </p>

<p>Founded in 2007, WPS is an established nonprofit 501(3)(c) organization dedicated to serving children and adults with special needs.  We follow the most stringent safety standards in the industry, established by the Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship International, or PATH Intl.  Our students come with a variety of disabilities including autism, developmental delays, birth defects, cerebral palsy, hearing impairment, speech disorders and epilepsy. By forming a special relationship with horses, students with cognitive, social, physical, and emotional disabilities are able to achieve impressive gains in these areas. </p>
<p>WPS is unique in Central Ohio. We only serve people with disabilities.  We're not a for profit stable with show horses, lessons and boarders, we focus on therapy riding and helping our students overcome personal challenges.  We keep our lesson fees low so that our already financially stressed families can afford the program.  We rely solely on fundraising events and private donations and everyone that ""works"" here is a volunteer.   Our founder, Christy Richmond, has personally funded WPS for years.  Our lessons take place in the beautiful wooded acreage and indoor arena that she built for her own use.  Back in 2007, a life threatening accident, (a kick from a horse split her liver), caused Christy to reevaluate her priorities, to leave her stressful but high paying career in medical sales and do something she'd wanted to do for years, heal kids with horses.</p>
<p>I've been an instructor, volunteer and fundraiser at WPS for 4 years.  To my students, I'm Miss Amy.  To me, they are a joy and an inspiration.  Thirteen year old Alicia was born with cerebral palsy.  Her stiff, spastic limbs make just getting her on horseback a difficult task.  That doesn't matter, her absolute love for horses is what gets her on and we usually laugh all through her lesson!  Afterwards, her muscles and joints are looser thanks to the horse's rolling walk.  Her body gets quite a work out just keeping itself centered on his back and her mom has to cajole her to leave the barn, stop brushing ""Chip"" and let him go have dinner!  </p>
<p>I've had many wonderful students over the years, some who laugh with me like Alicia and others who can't communicate as much with me as they can with the horse.  We have students who have learned to ride well and are starting to jump.  We have students who volunteer to help other students.  Walt, a young man  with autism, was awarded his Eagle Scout badge for a project he completed at WPS.  When Walt came to WPS, he hardly spoke or looked us in the eye.  Today, we rely on him as an important part of our program.</p>
<p><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></p>
<p>Everything is going well at WPS except for one thing.  We have volunteers, students, a long waiting list of potential students, and healthy horses (though we need a few more).  What we lack is funding.  Christy's resources are exhausted. We've never had a big corporate sponsor and the few mini grants we've received have literally been eaten up by the horses, they eat a lot of hay.  We've taken part in some local events but not ones with great earning potential yet.</p>
<p>We aren't giving up yet.  If we lose the property we can find somewhere else to do lessons but we'd lose our uniqueness, our place that's just for our students and their challenges.  With no place to keep it, we'll lose most of the tack and equipment we've acquired over the years.  We'll have to find homes for the horses, a difficult endeavor in this economy where people all over are having trouble keeping them.</p>
<p>We'd lose our future and the plans we have for our program.  We'd like to expand into helping others with different challenges, women recovering from breast cancer, military veterans with physical and emotional disabilities, and more.  We'd also like to get everyone off the waiting list and into lessons!</p>
<p>Your donations would help keep a good thing going.  Help us get back on our feet financially, give us more time to seek out sponsors and create fundraising events.  We need a big bandage to help us heal, buy us some more time so we can redouble our efforts and save the future of White Pine Stables for our students.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need Now and in the Future.</strong></p>
<p>We need to pay the mortgage, taxes and insurance.  That's about $4000 a month. Having a few months paid in advance would alleviate a lot of stress on everyone.   </p>
<p>We always need to feed our horses.  A load of hay lasts about 4 weeks and costs around $1000.  We need more horses, thus we'll need even more hay.  Then there's electricity, water, veterinary expenses, the blacksmith, fuel for the tractor, office supplies, cell phone, etc.</p>
<p>Christy needs a salary, something she hasn't had in years.  Paying her and a part time office assistant is a goal we have for future fundraising.  We'd also like to pay for a development staff member or contractor, someone to focus solely on fundraising while Christy takes care of most everything else involved in running WPS.</p>
<p>Our goal of at least $10,000 is a drop in the bucket to some non-profits but to us it'll mean we can stay afloat a while longer.  Even if we don't quite reach that goal, funds donated here will go towards paying the mortgage on the property and feeding our hardest workers, our horses.</p>
<p> <strong>Help Us &amp; The Horses May Hug You!</strong></p>
<p>Every little bit will help and though we can't afford to send you a t-shirt, please know we'll be overjoyed with any amount you send.  What we can give is appreciative shout outs on Facebook, Twitter and our website.  We'll tell everyone about the wonderful supporters we have and name some in our future promotions and fundraising materials.  We'll share our most delicious fundraiser with our heroes and heroines, <em>Christy's Gram's Buckeyes, </em>a delicious concoction of chocolate and peanut butter, very popular in Ohio!</p>

We would like to thank to all the supporters who helped us to make the Food Hacking Base at OHM 2013 reality. We hope you will come by and enjoy the event with us or if you are not present in a ""physical form"" you will keep an eye on it ""online"".
 
Oncer more many thanks,

Introduction
 

We are the Food Hacking Base (fhb), a bunch of hackers from all over the world who share the love of experimenting with food and beverages. After more than two years of promoting these concepts on some of the world major hacker events, we recently started our website and we are ready to become permanently active. We are building tools and trying out new techniques or those based on the ancient wisdom of traditional societies. Merging this ancient knowledge with today's scientific understanding and technology are some of our areas of interest.

This crowdfunder is about creating food&beverage hacking hub at the OHM2013  (Observe Hack Make) event and of course ""in the online world"". It is a place to hack food, either on your own or joining one of the donation based workshops. Next to that we will build and run a cookware washing area for the community and even build a prototype of a hexayurt-based cold room. We are documenting all of these activities and sharing it with the community as our contribution to the open source paradigm with the hope of changing the world for the better and enjoying it on the way!

  If you want to know more about how the FHB will be used, please read on at the chapter --The base--. Many thanks for your support, fhb!

 
The project
 

To provide the community with an excellent base for hacking food at OHM2013 and future events, we need your support. The funds we receive will go towards the basic infrastructure (tents, tables, floors), tools (pots, pans, stoves), and of course food! We'll need plenty of ingredients to welcome all visitors with exotic and exciting food and beverages and make food hacking a possibility for all, as we promoted at the last CCC camp, 28c3 and 29c3 conferences. 

 
  If you'd like to know in further detail how your money will be spent, we invite you to take a look at our OHM2013 wiki budget section.
Important to note is that any donations we receive that are not necessary to cover our costs will be set aside for Food Hacking Bases future events, next one being 30c3 in Hamburg.
 
  If you want to know more about how the FHB will be used, please read on at the chapter --The base--.
 
 

 
The base
 

As many of you might know, there is another major hacker conference coming this summer - OHM2013 in the Netherlands and we will be there! We've already had more than €500 donated within the core group, so that we can have a nice tent and some other stuff functioning as a food&beverage hacking hub. We have planned several workshops so people can join and contribute in a nice relaxed environment, leaving space for more collaboration and single projects. For one of the projects, for example, we will be makeing Matelade, a marmelade based on yerba mate, a herb for a tea-like beverage. Other projects include vegan hacking and probiotic beverages brewing, with ""Kombucha cosmopolita"" beeing the scary one! All this will be also presented during donation based workshops keeping to ""no one turned away for lack of funds"" system as we did before. We will be catering for ourselves and all interested during the event happily enjoying our experiments as a group, our capacity is around 15-20 people for a meal on regular bases. Another important feature worth of stressing is that  we also open the kitchen to the people  so you can join us and experiment on your stuff or play with your own food project after coordinating with us as on the last CCC camp. Again we will construct and run a community shared washing area for dishes and kitchen equipment. The new""big"" construction project for this event is a hexayurt based cold room which would be again shared as a community project, aimed to be reused on other events.

 
So come and join us at OHM2013 and thanks for supporting us, we really appreciate it :)

We are also currently building a foodhacking centric place online as well at https://foodhackingbase.org Join us there!

 
The goals
 

€700 - The Food Hacking Base is possible! We will be able to build the basic infrastructure for cooking and small workshops.

 

€1200 - At this level it's possible to prepare some foodstuffs and promotional materials in advance. Next to that we will be able to invest in more kitchen utensils for workshops and (glass) containers for projects.

 

€2500 and over - We will build and run a modular and reusable cold room. This room will make it possible to produce on a larger scale our probiotic drinks and even work on other projects that would otherwise not be achievable.",1.0,0,"7 Campaigns

<p>My name is Philip.  I am a former 1-percenter and former Marine.  I have chosen to give up my lifestyle &amp; join the 99%, to speak for those that are SUFFERING and who don't have a voice.  My great-grandfather, was Harry Jersig, President of Lone Star Brewery from after Prohibition - 1970's.  I have two sons 7-years-old &amp; 3-years-old.  My oldest son has High Functioning Autism.  I have decided to let go of all fear and live my life SOLELY out of LOVE.  My background is in Advertising &amp; Marketing - that was my first passion.  My two passions go hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>Our campaign is about getting to the root of all of our world problems - the lack of empathy, love, compassion, kindness &amp; understanding that our children are not being exposed to.  We need to teach them Empathy, as I believe and I believe Maria Montessori believed that this will lead to a Peaceful World.  If you've ever donated, volunteered for or given anything to a Non-Profit, then please consider our cause, as we would like to raise an entire generation of A CARING, KIND, LOVING &amp; NURTURING SOCIETY.

<h3> Detangling Matted Tangled Hair Prevents Depression</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We earnestly need more individuals to be hired and educated.  Hair loss can cause depression as well, but very matted hair tends to lead to depression faster.</p>
<p> Matted hair leads to depression, low self esteem and frustration.   Hair is a major part of every person’s identity and when the hair becomes matted or severely tangled for long periods of time it affects the self esteem.  This is also compounded with the opinions and judgmental views of others.</p>
<p> When hair becomes seriously tangled or matted, most people become so scared.  They don’t want to cut their hair.  Some people go into denial by allowing their hair to stay this way.  They are ashamed to go out in public or to even to their salon.  Inevitably their hair gets worse.</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>Value of Education/ Expansion Project To You and The World  </strong></h3>
<p>There is an urgent need for us to train and hire more professional hair detanglers, as well as educating salon hairdressers in the art of detangling hair.  Every day some one in the world is distraught with tangled matted hair.  This need has become a high demand service for us.</p>
<p><strong><em>Unfortunately, due to lack of education, many salons are actually making insensitive judgments</em></strong> about clients that have very matted hair.  Many hairdressers do not know how to patiently detangle, they are judgmental, and <strong>HEARTLESS.</strong></p>
<p>These hair stylists do not want to take the time to TRY to detangle a client that walks into the salon with severely matted tangled hair.  They take one look at their hair and say <strong>""have you considered a new hair cut.""</strong></p>
<h2>
<strong> </strong>The Impact of an International Education Plan</h2>
<p>Through the establishment of Professional Hair Detangler Salon Training Centers in major cities beginning in January 2013, we will train, certify and hire hairdressers, as well as individuals who are interested in learning how to remove dreadlocks, detangle very matted and severely tangled hair; tangled hair extensions, old or matted braids and weaves.  </p>
<p>We will extend our services by training people to provide mobile professional hair detangling services in hospitals, personal home service for people that are just returning home from hospitalizations, and homes for elderly.</p>
<p> We will also educate, train, and certify salons that want to provide these services.</p>
<h2> IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE'S HAIR</h2>
<p>We are very grateful for your support, your contributions will allow us to educate, employ more people by expanding into more cities.  And continue to provide a unique service that can help change lives and give people hope again.  We need people who value and respect each persons God given beauty in hair.</p>
<p>We are talented with this gift of taking down tangled matted knotted hair through and with the tangible touch of GOD.</p>
<p>The shame, self blame and loss of self esteem causes most women to begin concealing knots or clumps of matted hair. This is what leads to deep depression and frustration. </p>
<p>Matted tangled hair must be detangled immediately, or else it will lead to changes in thinking or mood.</p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Hello, my name is Miguel Sa and I am asking you for donations to my education because I have faith. I have faith in myself at bringing about a positive change in the world on many levels through the intentions of my actions, and the idea's I choose to engage with. I am passionate about making a difference in people's lives, whether it is as small as saying thank you or as grand as giving them a essential skill, item, or idea that helps them on their journey through life. The kind of help you give is essential, as jesus once said, you give a man a fish, you  feed him for a day. you teach a man to fish you feed him for a life time. That is why I see sustainable housing, one that can take care of your basic necessities, while also making you conscious of where these are coming from, as essential. Without relying on bureaucratic institutions, knowing how to grow your own food and form your own communities, would give you a sense of freedom and personal empowerment few know in our society. Also it is even more important to be able to take care of your own basic necessities because in our highly interconnected society, any sort of crisis across the world can directly effect the system in our own country that so many of us rely on to live. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><strong>A little about Me</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">I lived in toronto until I was four, then my parents divorced and I moved to Hamilton when my mother met my soon to become step father. There I lived the rest of my childhood until I decided I wanted to go to the University of Ottawa. My childhood was... interesting to say the least. I was the youngest of three brothers (one blood brother one step brother), and observed the struggles of bringing together two families. Needless to say Im thankful for every moment of my life, as without it I would not be where I am right now, and would not have learned so many valuable life lessons. Experiences are the greatest teachers we can have , teachers and books always come second, though they have played a major role in my growth. My Entire Family is Portuguese, and 98% of them live in Portugal, though the majority of my family on my step fathers side live here in Hamilton. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">My Decisions to go to the university of Ottawa was a easy one, its a beautiful city, I wanted to start fresh somewhere new, and the program I decided to go into , conflict studies and human rights, was exactly the kind of direction I wanted to take. Into my second semester I became somewhat disenfranchised with the university system, and the impractical and abstract ways of dealing with the idea of human rights and how someone ""deserves"" basic necessities. Though most of my grades were in the 80's, I had a feeling of incompleteness or longing for something else. Thats when I discovered earth ships through the documentary the Garbage warrior. It was like a revelation; a home built from mostly recycled materials, that collects rain water, produces electricity, grows food, regulates the temperature of the house using natural phenomenon. This technology puts the power of providing your own basic necessities into your own hands. As I was recently doing plenty of research about the water crisis, the food crisis, in a sense the vulnerability of the entire structure that western society lives off of made earth ships like a God send.

One day creating communities like these

 
What Kind Of world do we want to leave for our children?
What kind of world do we want to live in? 
Is there a way of even creating this world?
Join me in my Journey to try and create a better world not just for ourselves but for future generations!
Hello, my name is Miguel Sa and I am asking you for donations to my education because I have faith. I have faith in myself at bringing about a positive change in the world on many levels through the intentions of my actions, and the idea's I choose to engage with. I am passionate about making a difference in people's lives, whether it is as small as saying thank you or as grand as giving them a essential skill, item, or idea that helps them on their journey through life. The kind of help you give is essential, as jesus once said, you give a man a fish, you  feed him for a day. you teach a man to fish you feed him for a life time. That is why I see sustainable housing, one that can take care of your basic necessities, while also making you conscious of where these are coming from, as essential. Without relying on bureaucratic institutions, knowing how to grow your own food and form your own communities, would give you a sense of freedom and personal empowerment few know in our society. Also it is even more important to be able to take care of your own basic necessities because in our highly interconnected society, any sort of crisis across the world can directly effect the system in our own country that so many of us rely on to live. 
A little about Me
I lived in toronto until I was four, then my parents divorced and I moved to Hamilton when my mother met my soon to become step father. There I lived the rest of my childhood until I decided I wanted to go to the University of Ottawa. My childhood was... interesting to say the least. I was the youngest of three brothers (one blood brother one step brother), and observed the struggles of bringing together two families. Needless to say Im thankful for every moment of my life, as without it I would not be where I am right now, and would not have learned so many valuable life lessons. Experiences are the greatest teachers we can have , teachers and books always come second, though they have played a major role in my growth. My Entire Family is Portuguese, and 98% of them live in Portugal, though the majority of my family on my step fathers side live here in Hamilton. 
My Decisions to go to the university of Ottawa was a easy one, its a beautiful city, I wanted to start fresh somewhere new, and the program I decided to go into , conflict studies and human rights, was exactly the kind of direction I wanted to take. Into my second semester I became somewhat disenfranchised with the university system, and the impractical and abstract ways of dealing with the idea of human rights and how someone ""deserves"" basic necessities. Though most of my grades were in the 80's, I had a feeling of incompleteness or longing for something else. Thats when I discovered earth ships through the documentary the Garbage warrior. It was like a revelation; a home built from mostly recycled materials, that collects rain water, produces electricity, grows food, regulates the temperature of the house using natural phenomenon. This technology puts the power of providing your own basic necessities into your own hands. As I was recently doing plenty of research about the water crisis, the food crisis, in a sense the vulnerability of the entire structure that western society lives off of made earth ships like a God send. So I then realized I was not going to finish University, I attended one more semester of school and officially left Ottawa in january 2013. 
Right after I did a little bit of volunteering and then started working in my fathers company 50+ hours a week to help provide for the money I will be needing to go across America to New Mexico and then off to Missouri for the two courses I will be taking. 
About the courses; 
 The first course is going to be at the Earth ship community just outside of Taos New Mexico where I will be learning the philosophy of earth ships while also receiving hands on training in building earth ships from scratch. It last six weeks from late april until early june. From here I will then go do some volunteer farming in colorado to cut down the cost of the trip, learning more about farming, and to bring me closer to my second destination. 
The second course is an Eco-village course in Rutledge, Missouri where I will be living in an intentional community who has its own local currency, produces most of its own food using permaculture, and builds natural homes out of straw and clay, and insulating with newspaper. The Village is called Dancing rabbit and I will be living there for 37 days from july 5 to august 11. If you want more info on either of the curriculums don’t be afraid to ask, I will give you a full itinerary of what every day would look like and major concepts covered in each course. 
THE TOTAL COST
Earth ship course 2000$US
Eco-village course 2400$US (now only 1900$ because I got a scholarship! thank you ecovillage education!) 
Total transportation (estimation) 750-1000$US (taking buses and trains ....my mom would kill me if I hitchhiked...literally)
Its funny because I feel selfish and unworthy to ask strangers or even family and friends for money. Even though walking down the street if a person asks me for change I never second guess giving them any change I do have. The difference here is I can share with you what I learn and even give my own creativity or inspirations to others in return for any donation. Despite my savings from working , and receiving some support from my family, I will be short on my financial needs to go on this great learning experience. 
That is why I am asking you to make a difference, a donation small or big, will make a difference so please give what you can. Any of your contributions will be much appreciated, as Ive never done anything like this before, and even a small donation will make me extremely grateful. If you want to donate to a specific thing please  let me know. Most or all of the contributions without specific requests as to where they wish to be allocated, will be aimed at the second course for that needs to be payed by June 1st, and I will already be attending the earth ship course by the time this campaign ends . Also the funds will help cover the fees from indiegogo.
Your contribution will not only allow me to share what I learn/have learned with a wider audience via the great perks I offer for each donation level, but will also help me stay out of credit card debt! I did apply for a personal bank loan but was rejected because of my lack of resources. 
What You can do
1) make a donation of whatever is fitting with your income
2) share this campaign on twitter, facebook, or other social media outlets. 
Even if you don’t decide to contribute because one, you cant or two, you don’t see that I really am needing of your hard earned dollars. I hope you take a positive message, and some useful knowledge from this campaign, and use it to not only change your life but to help someone else become more sustainable in how they live.

<p><strong>My name is Lexus Loa and I am 12 year old only child with an amazing mother. </strong><strong>She has been raising me on her own. My father is in prison for taking someones life. My mom always tells me to ""stay young and have fun, be a kid"". Also to not only chase my dreams, but catch them as well. In the distant future my goal is to someday get a scholarship to sing at Juilliard Arts. I know that if I put in the effort I can achieve this eventually. Currently though an opportunity of a lifetime has come up. My class will be getting the chance to fly to D.C. and then go to New York. Everyone is invited but not everyone will go. You see this trip is very expensive. My mom said that no matter what I will go and she means what she says. But since she has always done so much for me my whole life I want her to get the chance to come with me. Altogether for both of us to go it will cost over $8000. It includes the flight, hotel, and food. All for 7 amazing days. So if there is anyone out there that can help me reach my goal. I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. For those who may not be able to help with my dream financially I still want to thank you for taking the time to read my story it really means alot to me. One thing you could do is spread the word around and tell your friends about me. Once again thank you so much.                  </strong></p>

<h2><strong>Peace and Blessings,</strong></h2>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">My name is Susan Diane Mitchell, and I am asking for angel donations, gifts and support to help me achieve a goal on my sacred path, a path of destiny that is much bigger than just myself.  I have consecrated my life work to be in sacred service to the Divine Afrikan Feminine, the divinity within Black women and people of Afrikan descent throughout the planet.  The goal I am reaching for, and for which I am asking for your help, is to raise the funds that will allow me to travel to a very important Transformative Studies Intensive Retreat as the very first part in a program of doctoral study to which I have been accepted. </h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I applied to, was accepted, and offered a scholarship for two years to assist me in pursuing a PhD in Transformative Studies from the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) in San Francisco, CA, for the 2013-14 academic year.  However, the scholarship assistance I am receiving does not cover travel expenses.  I am asking for financial help to cover airfare for myself and my caregiver/partner to assist me during the travel and the retreat, as my health necessitates such assistance.</h3>

<p>Both of which she is diagnosed with. We are now looking at the possibility of Fibromyalgia.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I am so honored by this opportunity, and I would like to explain why this is so important, beyond myself, and why your contribution is sowing seed in good, fertile soil.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>My Credentials,</h2>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I was born in Washington, D.C. in 1967 to young, beautiful, intelligent parents who were students at Howard University. After my parents divorced, I was raised for the majority of my childhood in Oakland, CA, visiting my father in his home of Anniston, AL every summer.  I am blessed to have the ancestral roots that I have, for both of my parents, and my grandparents before them, blessed me with a richness of life and a thirst for knowledge.  I have been supported by wonderful people who love me, and I have always been encouraged to study, write, teach, and excel in my studies.  I attended Spelman College from 1985 to 1988 on an Honors Scholarship, where I studied English and Spanish as a double major. </h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I ultimately completed my undergraduate studies in English and Spanish at Jacksonville State University in Jacksonville, AL, graduating with Special Honors in English. I continued my studies while raising a family while attending the University of Alabama at Birmingham as a Graduate Assistant in the Department of English, where I earned an MA in English and American Literature. My studies at Spelman College in the literature of Black women continued at UAB, where I submitted a thesis that focused on the literature of Africana womanist writers, such as Toni Morrison, Maryse Conde, and Gloria Naylor.  I received a High Pass on this scholarship, and graduated with distinction.  In addition, I worked for many years as a college instructor at a community college, a distance learning school, a university, and a technical school, as well as a private and volunteer tutor and instructor for language classes.</h3>
<p>          </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Those are some of my accolades, and I speak of these  accomplishments to demonstrate that I am highly capable of successfully completing this doctoral program.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>Scholarship</h2>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I want to explain what I discovered during the research for my thesis,  what I have remembered about myself in the process, and why it is so important that I continue on my sacred path.  In applying an original theory of ""spirit discourse,"" I was able to trace a sacred Afrikan feminine principle that underlay every conceivable hardship, oppression, abuse, disenfranchisement, and neglect that these amazing narratives portrayed in the experiences of the Afrikan woman characters depicted in the novels.  I identified this principle as an ancient, primordial, essential transformative and creative power that women possess in general but which I posit Afrikan women and women of Afrikan descent possess in particular because of their experience and because of the anciency of Afrikan spiritual practices that show up, even despite themselves, in the lives and stories of Afrikan women.  I became fascinated with the idea that soon grew into conviction that women--and Afrikan women in particular because of their most ancient connection to the Divine as the first humans on the planet--have within them innate, creative and transformative energy and power that, when cultivated and nurtured rather than debased and destroyed, can significantly impact the healing process that is so desperately needed for the planet and all of her peoples. </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">CIIS is an integral part of a ""mecca"" in the Bay Area of worldwide sacred feminine scholarship, and my presence, voice, participation and leadership in this arena is crucial to placing the Afrikan woman in the center of the Great Work that is being done to transform the earth into a place that blesses and sustains everyone and every beneficial lifeform.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I am the mother of four beautiful daughters and five beautiful sons.  I am living with a host of neurological symptoms of diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis and Chiari 1 malformation, and suspected fibromyalgia, which include chronic pain and fatigue.  Pursuing this life goal of earning a doctorate in the ""field of my dreams,"" in the writing, research, teaching and visioning of the sacred Afrikan feminine is so healing for me and healing for others. </h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The despair I feel sometimes in coping with the pain and fatigue, and the limitations that accompany them is chased away by my excitement of this opportunity. I have much to live for and much to look forward to, and I feel great excitement and gratitude to be able to continue my sacred path in the service of teaching and writing about the Divine Afrikan Feminine, and the anciency of the Black Goddess.  Please help me get to California so that I can continue this most auspicious sacred work.</h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Thank you so much.</h3>

My name is Susan Diane Mitchell, and I am asking for angel donations, gifts and support to help me achieve a goal on my sacred path, a path of destiny that is much bigger than just myself.  I have consecrated my life work to be in sacred service to the Divine Afrikan Feminine, the divinity within Black women and people of Afrikan descent throughout the planet.  The goal I am reaching for, and for which I am asking for your help, is to raise the funds that will allow me to travel to a very important Transformative Studies Intensive Retreat as the very first part in a program of doctoral study to which I have been accepted. 
I applied to, was accepted, and offered a scholarship for two years to assist me in pursuing a PhD in Transformative Studies from the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) in San Francisco, CA, for the 2013-14 academic year.  However, the scholarship assistance I am receiving does not cover travel expenses.  I am asking for financial help to cover airfare for myself and my caregiver/partner to assist me during the travel and the retreat, as my health necessitates such assistance.
 
Here is a link for Chiari Malformation Type I

and
Multiple Sclerosis
http://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/guide/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis
Both of which she is diagnosed with. We are now looking at the possibility of Fibromyalgia.
 
I am so honored by this opportunity, and I would like to explain why this is so important, beyond myself, and why your contribution is sowing seed in good, fertile soil.
 
My Credentials,
I was born in Washington, D.C. in 1967 to young, beautiful, intelligent parents who were students at Howard University. After my parents divorced, I was raised for the majority of my childhood in Oakland, CA, visiting my father in his home of Anniston, AL every summer.  I am blessed to have the ancestral roots that I have, for both of my parents, and my grandparents before them, blessed me with a richness of life and a thirst for knowledge.  I have been supported by wonderful people who love me, and I have always been encouraged to study, write, teach, and excel in my studies.  I attended Spelman College from 1985 to 1988 on an Honors Scholarship, where I studied English and Spanish as a double major. 
I ultimately completed my undergraduate studies in English and Spanish at Jacksonville State University in Jacksonville, AL, graduating with Special Honors in English. I continued my studies while raising a family while attending the University of Alabama at Birmingham as a Graduate Assistant in the Department of English, where I earned an MA in English and American Literature. My studies at Spelman College in the literature of Black women continued at UAB, where I submitted a thesis that focused on the literature of Africana womanist writers, such as Toni Morrison, Maryse Conde, and Gloria Naylor.  I received a High Pass on this scholarship, and graduated with distinction.  In addition, I worked for many years as a college instructor at a community college, a distance learning school, a university, and a technical school, as well as a private and volunteer tutor and instructor for language classes.
          
Those are some of my accolades, and I speak of these  accomplishments to demonstrate that I am highly capable of successfully completing this doctoral program.
 
Scholarship
I want to explain what I discovered during the research for my thesis,  what I have remembered about myself in the process, and why it is so important that I continue on my sacred path.  In applying an original theory of ""spirit discourse,"" I was able to trace a sacred Afrikan feminine principle that underlay every conceivable hardship, oppression, abuse, disenfranchisement, and neglect that these amazing narratives portrayed in the experiences of the Afrikan woman characters depicted in the novels.  I identified this principle as an ancient, primordial, essential transformative and creative power that women possess in general but which I posit Afrikan women and women of Afrikan descent possess in particular because of their experience and because of the anciency of Afrikan spiritual practices that show up, even despite themselves, in the lives and stories of Afrikan women.  I became fascinated with the idea that soon grew into conviction that women--and Afrikan women in particular because of their most ancient connection to the Divine as the first humans on the planet--have within them innate, creative and transformative energy and power that, when cultivated and nurtured rather than debased and destroyed, can significantly impact the healing process that is so desperately needed for the planet and all of her peoples. 
 
CIIS is an integral part of a ""mecca"" in the Bay Area of worldwide sacred feminine scholarship, and my presence, voice, participation and leadership in this arena is crucial to placing the Afrikan woman in the center of the Great Work that is being done to transform the earth into a place that blesses and sustains everyone and every beneficial lifeform.
 
I am the mother of four beautiful daughters and five beautiful sons.  I am living with a host of neurological symptoms of diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis and Chiari 1 malformation, and suspected fibromyalgia, which include chronic pain and fatigue.  Pursuing this life goal of earning a doctorate in the ""field of my dreams,"" in the writing, research, teaching and visioning of the sacred Afrikan feminine is so healing for me and healing for others. 
The despair I feel sometimes in coping with the pain and fatigue, and the limitations that accompany them is chased away by my excitement of this opportunity. I have much to live for and much to look forward to, and I feel great excitement and gratitude to be able to continue my sacred path in the service of teaching and writing about the Divine Afrikan Feminine, and the anciency of the Black Goddess.  Please help me get to California so that I can continue this most auspicious sacred work.
 
Thank you so much.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>ABOUT THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. The problem</strong><br/>In spite of international law that prohibits the use of child soldiers, an estimated 300.000 children are currently active as soldiers. In the context of the international community and international humanitarian work, there is a general consensus on the use of child soldiers, namely that it should be banned as soon as possible. But even though international legislation provides for this wish, in practice it seems that legal instruments are only partly effective.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why the use of children in war has not stopped yet is the fact that international law on the subject is ambiguous to say the least. Confusion starts from the question what the definition of the child is. Also, these laws are imposed upon groups that never had to do with their creation in the first place, since only governments have been involved in the creation of international laws.</p>
<p>For example Denov, who is a specialist on the subject of child soldiers, argues that defining childhood based on age reflects a bias towards Western notions of childhood. She writes:</p>
<p>""The United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as ‘every human being below eighteen years’ (article 1). However, ‘childhood’ is indeed a contested concept and a social construction that varies in form and content across cultures and social groups, and is defined by localized understandings and values. Defining childhood based solely upon age not only reflects a bias towards western notions of childhood which are rooted in biomedical theory (Kemper 2005), but also may overlook other salient cultural social, economic, gendered, class and other status determinants that extend well beyond the notion of age (2010: 2).""</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. The research question</strong><br/>Central to the question and practice of child soldiers is the question of the child. What is “a child”? What does “childhood” mean? Is the concept of childhood a cultural and temporal bound concept, or is it a universal, timeless fact (as international law seems to claim)? And what does it have to do with age? How are children different from adults and where do we draw a line, if there even is one?</p>
<p>Only when these questions are answered, one can start to look at the more normative questions underlying the question of child soldiers, being amongst others, why is it wrong to use child soldiers? Why is it wrong for children to be involved in armed conflicts? Why should this norm be embedded in international law?</p>
<p>In my research I intend to look into the question of the concept of childhood. The central question to my research will be: “what is the meaning of the concept of childhood, in the context of the use of child soldiers?”. I will link this question to the practice of the use of child soldiers in Africa, specifically Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. Methodology</strong><br/>For this purpose I will engage in both </p>
<ol>
<li>A philosophical and historical investigation into the concept of childhood (theoretical part)</li>
<li>An investigation into the concept of childhood in the context of the use of child soldiers  (field research)</li>
</ol><p>For the second part I will conduct 70 interviews with different groups of people from Rwanda, Congo, the Netherlands and Belgium - people who are involved in the practice of child soldiers or have been involved, policy makers on children's rights, humanitarian workers and ""ordinary local people"". I will ask all of these groups aboutt their perspective on the question ""what is a child"". </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4. Expected Results</strong></p>
<p>I expect to find different answers to the question “what is the meaning of the concept of childhood?”. Departing from a philosophical and historical perspective, explaining how the idea of childhood originated, how the concept of childhood can be understood as part of a language game and how the idea of childhood is part of constructed social reality, I assume this perspective will create a frame in which to explain and understand the empirical data found in the interviews, including their expected variety. I expect that different people from different groups of interest will give different answers to questions concerning the concept of childhood. Ultimately I expect to come to a general conclusion regarding the concept of childhood understood in the frame of a philosophical perspective. I think the philosophical perspective will help to explain the different content of answers and to combine the answers to a unified answer to the research question.</p>
<p>Also, I expect to come up with recommendations for further research on the subject of the concept of the child, international humanitarian law and the use of child soldiers. The research will also provide input for policy-making and research on current policies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5. Who am I</strong><br/>My name is Marieke Hopman, I am 24 years old. I live in Amsterdam, which is where I'm studying for my masters in philosophy. The current research is my own initiative. It will serve as my master thesis and also for my master after master's thesis at Gent University (Belgium). This is my personal project for the next two years. The only reason I started it is because I realized I wanted to do something usefull with my time, education and brain. I am truly hoping this is how I can contribute to a better world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>6. What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong><br/><br/>The budget necessary to finish the project is <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">€10,000,- (USD 13,108)</span>. The whole of this budget will be spent on costs for research, mainly costs for field research. My contribution are my hours (approximately 1800 hours over two years).</p>
<p>Any contribution is very welcome. If I turn out not to meet the total budget I might consider chipping in myself or cutting budget (probably both). But the budget is already pretty tight as it is.</p>

opportunity…just for some more than others.” (Washington Post Oct. 18th, 2014)
At The Center for Arts Education we strive to level the playing field, and we need your support today.
In a world where neighborhood and
family income are predictors of success, (NYTimes Feb 9th, 2012) we use the ARTS
to help students who might not have any other path to a successful career. 
Our Career Development Program
helps students connect to the $21 billion creative arts industry through our
Boot Camp and Internship program.
And with your help we can help
students achieve their dreams.

Why This Matters Now
Funding has changed, and we need to raise a minimum of $12,500 to continue providing these kids with the skills and experiences they need to compete and succeed in the 21st Century workplace.
Our students come primarily from NYC's outer boroughs -- Queens, The Bronx and Brooklyn and a large majority of our students qualify for free lunch. 
Your donation pays for all Boot Camp expenses, Career Awareness Day, graduation, and students' arts experiences and provides a stipend and a metro card for each student.
The next class is scheduled to start in less than 2 months. We need your help to make sure these students have an experience that honors their talent and ambition.

                                 


The Career Development Program includes:



Three-Week Intensive Boot Camp: Students learn the essentials of the workplace from resume writing to networking, email etiquette to career roadmapping. Students graduate from Boot Camp with comprehensive jobs-skills and are prepared to begin their internships.

Arts Experiences: Students explore and experience the wide range of art and culture available in New York City - they will attend a Broadway show, visit museums and galleries, and participate in performing and visual arts workshops.  

Interviews: Students interview for internships at arts and creative businesses around New York City in a variety of fields including architecture, theater, music, design, advertising, the visual arts, and fashion.

Internships: Students are placed in  13-week internships at top NYC arts and arts-related businesses where dedicated mentors show them the ropes and teach them the business.  Frequently, internships turn into summer jobs and beyond.

<p>I gave birth to Adelaide Shekwoshimi Hideyoshi Ogidion May 30 2007.  I was 46 years old, eleven years older than his father and Adelaide(<strong>Adel for short</strong>) is our Only child.  He was diagnosed with two holes in the heart (a PDA and VSD) when he was 5 months old.  His life was ebbing away as his heart grew weaker, larger, occupying virtually all his chest, with more than 50% shunt of the blood pumped from his heart into his lungs.  He was weak and blue when I took him to Hudrulaya Narayana (a Heart Hospital) in Bangalore where he had a surgery with support from feminists and friends like Meena Seshu, Pramada Menon, Bene Madunagu, and the humanitarian desk of the hospital.  This is where Adel was diagnosed with the Down Syndrome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He recovered gradually from the impact of the heart condition</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He took a little longer in his case to sit without support, crawl, stand and took his first steps when he was 26 months old.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this point, I had started bombarding him with Sesame Street, Barney and Vegetale videos.  He took interest in them was learned over the next two years to say his alphabets, sing along and dance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In all the sessions we had, with his paediatricians and the endocrinologist, they were convinced that he could cope in a regular school because he displayed high level of intelligence.  The Endocrinologist in fact concluded that he must have the mosaic pattern of down syndrome since other children his age could not do certain tasks that Adel was capable of.</p>
<p>At four I enrolled him in a kindergarten class of a faith based institution.  I moved him from there to a private Primary School believing that they had a standard that will enable Adel progress well in his education.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Till this point, I had had to fight discrimination and stigma including from family members (his father and his relatives) who saw Adel as an abnormal and handicapped child.  The traditional way of receiving a child born into a family was not performed for Adel.  All through the hospitalisation and surgery, his father’s relations did not visit him in the hospital.  A huge statement of rejection given what should ordinarily have been the case in a cultural setting where extended families are closely knit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At three, Adel could call elevators, select the floors, he could identify our hotel rooms, he could tell his way around town, as wrong turns would draw a cry.  From the age of two, he could operate the DVD player, select channels from the TV, operate the mobile phone in and out of various folders, identify all the letters of the alphabet and numbers in whatever order they are presented, including mirror image.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In November 2011, his father left us discontinuing his financial support. One of the reasons he gave was that since I was treating cancer (I have been on treatment for CA breast since December 2010 when I had RMM) and was not in a position to give birth to more children, and the only son I gave him was not normal, he needed to go find some other woman who will have more children for him.  It was an additional pain when in September 2012 the  School wrote me a letter advising me to withdraw my son from their school.  This was shocking because he had passed his examinations.  Convinced that his expulsion from school was a discrimination based on his birth condition, I sued the school and presented evidence of his continually improving performance.  The Judge ruled on 14<sup>th</sup> February 2013 that the school had acted “in the best interest of the child”.  To pursue appeal on the case, is further depletion of resources needed for his education especially since financial support from his father was no longer forth coming.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the little resources I had left I approached other much cheaper schools to get him back to school, but the efforts have failed.  He is constantly rejected and I am told to take him to the school of the “deaf and dump”, only school for people with hearing and speech impairment. </p>
<p>The options I have exist only outside Minna, the town where I live and work. Please I need your financial support to take him to Abuja or Lagos to offer him the education he so desperately needs and record a success story that debunks myths, stereotypes and taboos.</p>
<p>I thank you, Adel thanks you For taking the time to read our story and for your anticipated support</p>

<h2 class=""p1""><strong>Traditional Chinese Culture Center</strong></h2>
<p><span class=""s1""><strong>(中文在下面）</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Why a Traditional Chinese Culture Center?</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">After spending most of my adult life in China, in 2006 I moved back to North Carolina. I became a visiting scholar at Duke University where I'd studied in the 1980s. I was astonished to find that there's now as much Mandarin as English spoken on the campus. Chinese are by far the largest group of international students at Duke. When I attended there were only a couple of Chinese graduate students and no undergraduates. Now the number of both is in the thousands, well more than half of the international student body. With China's economy continuing to grow rapidly there is increasing international interest in China. The number of young Westerners studying Chinese language, history and culture is skyrocketing. We host a Chinese Roundtable once a week at Duke and dozens of Chinese and American students gather to speak Mandarin and share their mutual interest in Chinese culture. I host regular homemade Chinese dumpling parties at my house and the attendance always numbers in the dozens. My house is already an informal Chinese culture center. Now I'm formalizing it. It's clear that the time is ripe for a traditional Chinese culture center in Durham. </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>What will we offer?</strong> </p>
<p class=""p1"">The center will offer classes in:</p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li1"">Mandarin language </li>
<li class=""li1"">Calligraphy and Painting</li>
<li class=""li1"">Martial Arts</li>
<li class=""li1"">Yoga</li>
<li class=""li1"">Meditation</li>
<li class=""li1"">Traditional Chinese Medicine, Acupressure Massage and Bodywork</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1"">Other activities include:</p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li1"">Vintage Chinese tea ceremonies</li>
<li class=""li1"">Traditional meals from our on-site organic garden</li>
<li class=""li1"">Chinese music performances</li>
<li class=""li1"">Chinese film screenings</li>
<li class=""li1"">Homemade Chinese dumpling parties</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>My History</strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Water &amp; Tea </strong><span class=""s1""><strong>水</strong></span><span class=""s2""><strong>/</strong></span><span class=""s1""><strong>火</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1"">After two decades in China, I moved back to the Bay Area and met a teacher of traditional Chinese culture more knowledgeable than any I'd found in China. Wang Mingyi and I had known each other in Beijing prior to the events of 1989. I was a foreign correspondent for UPI and he was a translator for the Baltimore Sun. After the tragedy in Tiananmen Square in June 1989 people were scattered to the winds. Mingyi returned to his village in southwestern Yunnan Province—bordering the Golden Triangle of Burma, Vietnam and Thailand—and apprenticed with a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine. He began practicing the healing arts, met and married an American woman, had three children and moved to San Francisco. It was there that I met him again after more than a decade. He looked the picture of health—younger than when I had last seen him more than ten years before. I said to him: ""Whatever you're doing to stay so healthy, I want to learn it."" He smiled and said: ""Drink hot water."" </p>
<p class=""p1"">This is based on the Zen-Taoist principle: <span class=""s1"">上善若水</span> (the highest virtue is to be like water). But Doctor Wang explained to me that the real meaning is to BE water. It's a traditional health practice dating back millennia, fusing the water and fire elements [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xing"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s3"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xing</span></a>] to flush the body of toxins and cleanse it. To aid in the ingestion of hot water we drink vintage Pu'er old growth tea from Doctor Wang's home province of Yunnan. Our healing center will make this unique tea available to all interested in experiencing traditional Chinese tea culture.<br/><br/><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Clean Food </strong><span class=""s1""><strong>木</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Soon after meeting Doctor Wang I quit my magazine editing job at UC-Berkeley and began spending every day with him, helping with his clinic, patients, and learning as much as I could about his traditional healing practice. In addition to drinking hot water, the practice also includes a simple plant-based diet. The philosophy is that we are so full of toxins that to cleanse you have to first stop putting more poison into your body. I've seen people lose ten pounds in a week this way, not fasting but just drinking hot water and eating healthy food. I helped Doctor Wang open a healing center in the Mission District of San Francisco, and moved into the center as its first caretaker. After serving in the center for a year, I drove cross-country to Duke and found that traditional China had come to North Carolina.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Kung-fu </strong><span class=""s1""><strong>金</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Upon arriving, I sought out the Duke Tai-Chi Club. I found a martial arts community more vibrant than any I encountered in my daily pre-dawn forays to Chinese parks to learn tai-chi. The Duke Tai-Chi Club was led by Ben Fisher, a disciple of Master Sam Chin and his <span class=""s1"">意力拳</span>/Iliqchuan (ILC) family martial art [<a href=""http://www.mindfulkungfu.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s3"">http://www.mindfulkungfu.com</span></a>]. I've been studying with them ever since. The group, no longer affiliated with Duke, meets three times a week for 2-3 hours and practices solo exercises and also spars. Sam Chin is the most knowledgeable martial artist I've ever studied with. He's a dedicated teacher with students all over the world. </p>
<p class=""p2"">The North Carolina ILC community is a special piece of traditional Chinese culture in Durham, and our culture center will host regular martial art classes and events.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Organic Farming </strong><span class=""s1""><strong>土</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1"">During my time in China, what I missed more than anything was unspoiled nature. I've reconnected with that in North Carolina. My love for the outdoors and commitment to healthy eating has led me to organic gardening. For the past six years I've cultivated my own and the Duke Community organic garden. I grow most of the food I eat, supplemented by the fresh produce at the Durham Farmer's Market. Organic gardening is an integral part of my health and spiritual practice, as it was in traditional Chinese culture.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Our traditional culture center will teach people not only how to grow their own organic produce, but how to live off of it. We will offer organic meals and juice from our home-grown fruit.</p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>中国传统文化中心</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>为何要开办中国传统文化中心？</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">我的大部分成年时光是在中国渡过的。2006年，我搬回北卡，在我曾于80年代就读过的杜克大学做访问学者。我非常吃惊地发现，在校园内，说中文像说英文一样普遍。迄今为止，中国留学生是杜克大学外国留学生中最大的群体。80年代我上学时，杜克只有为数不多的来自中国的研究生，且根本没有本科生。现在不同了，中国的研究生和本科生加起来有几千人，占外国留学生半数以上。随着中国经济的不断快速发展，人们对中国的兴趣愈加浓厚。学习中文、 中国历史和文化的年轻西方人与日俱增。我们在杜克举办的每周一次的中国圆桌会议，每次都有几十位中美学生出席，他们聚在一起说中文，分享对中国文化的感想。我也常在家开饺子派对，总有几十位客人光临。我的家一直是个非正式的中国文化中心。现在时机已经成熟，我要把它办成在Durham正式的中国传统文化中心。</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong><br/>提供的活动项目：</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">中心将提供以下课程：</span></p>
<p class=""p4""> </p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">普通话</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">书法、 绘画</span></p>

<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">打坐</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">中医，指压按摩，及全身治疗 (bodywork)</span></p>
<p class=""p4""> </p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">其他活动包括：</span></p>
<p class=""p4""> </p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">传统中国茶道</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">用自家种植的有机植物烹调的传统美食</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">中国音乐表演</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">中国电影放映</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">自制饺子派对</span></p>
<p class=""p4""> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>我的经历</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><strong>水与茶—水/火</strong></span> </p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">在中国工作和居住了20年后，我回到了旧金山湾区，再次遇见了这位比我在中国认识的任何人都精通中国文化的老师。 我和王明一（Wang Mingyi）早在1989年事件之前就在北京相识。 我当时是合众国际社的外国记者，他是巴尔迪摩太阳报的翻译。1989年6月天安门广场悲剧发生后，人们都随风散落各地。明一回到了他位于缅甸、越南和泰国金三角边界的云南省的村庄，给一位中医当学徒。他开始实践这一医术，邂逅了一位美国妇女，便与她结婚成家。他们育有三名子女，现住旧金山。在那里，十年之后，我再次跟他不期而遇。 他是健康的化身，他比我十几年初次见面时更年轻了。我跟他说：“你是怎么保持健康的，我也要跟你学。”他笑着对我说：“喝热水。”</span></p>
<p class=""p4"">这源于禅和道家的原理：上善若水。 但王大夫跟我解释说它的真正含义就是人要像水一样。这是有着几千年历史的医道，通过水与火融合将体内的毒素冲洗干净。为了有助于热水的吸收，我们每天喝王大夫云南老家种植的陈年普洱。我们的治疗中心备有这种独特的茶，随时欢迎对传统中国茶道感兴趣的人。</p>
<p class=""p4""> </p>
<p class=""p4""><strong>干净的食物—木</strong></p>
<p class=""p4"">见到王大夫不久，我就辞去了在加州伯克利大学做杂志编辑的工作。我每天跟王大夫一道帮他料理诊所和患者，同时跟他学习他的传统治疗术。除了喝热水，该治疗术还包括主要由植物构成的食谱。该原理认为，我们全身充满毒素，要想清洗，必须首先停止把更多的毒素带入体内。我亲眼见到有人用此办法在一周内体重减轻了10磅。这并不是禁食，而是喝热水，吃健康食品。我帮助王大夫在旧金山的Mission 区开办了他的诊所，随即搬到那里成为诊所第一个管理人。在诊所服务了一年之后，我开车穿越美国返回杜克，我发现传统的中国已经来到了北卡。</p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""> </span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><strong>功夫—金</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">一到此地，我便找到了杜克太极俱乐部。这里的武术社区充满活力，绝不亚于当年我每天凌晨在中国的公园学太极拳所见的景象。杜克太极俱乐部由Ben Fisher 带领。Ben Fisher是Sam Chin 师傅的弟子，跟随他学习意力拳。我从那时开始就一直跟他们学。如今，这个俱乐部已经不属于杜克了。它的成员每周三次、 每次2 到3 小时练习单手拳和对手拳。Sam Chin 是我所从师的武术教练中对武术最精通的师傅。他具有奉献精神，他的学生来自世界各地。</span> </p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">北卡意力拳社团是Durham 中国传统文化的一只独秀。我们的文化中心将举办定期的武术课和活动。</span></p>
<p class=""p4""> </p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><strong>有机栽培—土</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">在中国居住期间，我最怀念的是未受破坏的自然。回到北卡，我又回归到大自然之中。我对户外运动的热爱和对健康饮食的承诺使我开始栽培有机植物。六年来，我耕种自家和杜克社区的菜园。我吃的大部分食品是我自己种的，其它的是Durham 农贸市场的新鲜农产品。就像中国传统文化，有机栽培是我身体和精神实践的一个组成部分。</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">我们的传统文化中心不仅会教大家怎样种植有机农产品，还教人们怎样靠它生活。我们还会提供自家种植的有机美食和水果的果汁。</span></p>

My History
Water & Tea 水/火
After two decades in China, I moved back to the Bay Area and met a teacher of traditional Chinese culture more knowledgeable than any I'd found in China. Wang Mingyi and I had known each other in Beijing prior to the events of 1989. I was a foreign correspondent for UPI and he was a translator for the Baltimore Sun. After the tragedy in Tiananmen Square in June 1989 people were scattered to the winds. Mingyi returned to his village in southwestern Yunnan Province—bordering the Golden Triangle of Burma, Vietnam and Thailand—and apprenticed with a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine. He began practicing the healing arts, met and married an American woman, had three children and moved to San Francisco. It was there that I met him again after more than a decade. He looked the picture of health—younger than when I had last seen him more than ten years before. I said to him: ""Whatever you're doing to stay so healthy, I want to learn it."" He smiled and said: ""Drink hot water."" 
This is based on the Zen-Taoist principle: 上善若水 (the highest virtue is to be like water). But Doctor Wang explained to me that the real meaning is to BE water. It's a traditional health practice dating back millennia, fusing the water and fire elements [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xing] to flush the body of toxins and cleanse it. To aid in the ingestion of hot water we drink vintage Pu'er old growth tea from Doctor Wang's home province of Yunnan. Our healing center will make this unique tea available to all interested in experiencing traditional Chinese tea culture. 
Clean Food 木
Soon after meeting Doctor Wang I quit my magazine editing job at UC-Berkeley and began spending every day with him, helping with his clinic, patients, and learning as much as I could about his traditional healing practice. In addition to drinking hot water, the practice also includes a simple plant-based diet. The philosophy is that we are so full of toxins that to cleanse you have to first stop putting more poison into your body. I've seen people lose ten pounds in a week this way, not fasting but just drinking hot water and eating healthy food. I helped Doctor Wang open a healing center in the Mission District of San Francisco, and moved into the center as its first caretaker. After serving in the center for a year, I drove cross-country to Duke and found that traditional China had come to North Carolina.
 
Kung-fu 金 
Upon arriving, I sought out the Duke Tai-Chi Club. I found a martial arts community more vibrant than any I encountered in my daily pre-dawn forays to Chinese parks to learn tai-chi. The Duke Tai-Chi Club was led by Ben Fisher, a disciple of Master Sam Chin and his 意力拳/Iliqchuan (ILC) family martial art [http://www.mindfulkungfu.com]. I've been studying with them ever since. The group, no longer affiliated with Duke, meets three times a week for 2-3 hours and practices solo exercises and also spars. Sam Chin is the most knowledgeable martial artist I've ever studied with. He's a dedicated teacher with students all over the world. 
The North Carolina ILC community is a special piece of traditional Chinese culture in Durham, and our culture center will host regular martial art classes and events.
 
Organic Farming 土
During my time in China, what I missed more than anything was unspoiled nature. I've reconnected with that in North Carolina. My love for the outdoors and commitment to healthy eating has led me to organic gardening. For the past six years I've cultivated my own and the Duke Community organic garden. I grow most of the food I eat, supplemented by the fresh produce at the Durham Farmer's Market. Organic gardening is an integral part of my health and spiritual practice, as it was in traditional Chinese culture.
Our traditional culture center will teach people not only how to grow their own organic produce, but how to live off of it. We will offer organic meals and juice from our home-grown fruit.

 
中国传统文化中心
为何要开办中国传统文化中心？
我的大部分成年时光是在中国渡过的。2006年，我搬回北卡，在我曾于80年代就读过的杜克大学做访问学者。我非常吃惊地发现，在校园内，说中文像说英文一样普遍。迄今为止，中国留学生是杜克大学外国留学生中最大的群体。80年代我上学时，杜克只有为数不多的来自中国的研究生，且根本没有本科生。现在不同了，中国的研究生和本科生加起来有几千人，占外国留学生半数以上。随着中国经济的不断快速发展，人们对中国的兴趣愈加浓厚。学习中文、 中国历史和文化的年轻西方人与日俱增。我们在杜克举办的每周一次的中国圆桌会议，每次都有几十位中美学生出席，他们聚在一起说中文，分享对中国文化的感想。我也常在家开饺子派对，总有几十位客人光临。我的家一直是个非正式的中国文化中心。现在时机已经成熟，我要把它办成在Durham正式的中国传统文化中心。
提供的活动项目：
中心将提供以下课程：
 
普通话
书法、 绘画
武术
瑜伽
打坐
中医，指压按摩，及全身治疗 (bodywork)
 
其他活动包括：
 
传统中国茶道
用自家种植的有机植物烹调的传统美食
中国音乐表演
中国电影放映
自制饺子派对
 
我的经历
水与茶—水/火 
在中国工作和居住了20年后，我回到了旧金山湾区，再次遇见了这位比我在中国认识的任何人都精通中国文化的老师。 我和王明一（Wang Mingyi）早在1989年事件之前就在北京相识。 我当时是合众国际社的外国记者，他是巴尔迪摩太阳报的翻译。1989年6月天安门广场悲剧发生后，人们都随风散落各地。明一回到了他位于缅甸、越南和泰国金三角边界的云南省的村庄，给一位中医当学徒。他开始实践这一医术，邂逅了一位美国妇女，便与她结婚成家。他们育有三名子女，现住旧金山。在那里，十年之后，我再次跟他不期而遇。 他是健康的化身，他比我十几年初次见面时更年轻了。我跟他说：“你是怎么保持健康的，我也要跟你学。”他笑着对我说：“喝热水。”
这源于禅和道家的原理：上善若水。 但王大夫跟我解释说它的真正含义就是人要像水一样。这是有着几千年历史的医道，通过水与火融合将体内的毒素冲洗干净。为了有助于热水的吸收，我们每天喝王大夫云南老家种植的陈年普洱。我们的治疗中心备有这种独特的茶，随时欢迎对传统中国茶道感兴趣的人。
 
干净的食物—木
见到王大夫不久，我就辞去了在加州伯克利大学做杂志编辑的工作。我每天跟王大夫一道帮他料理诊所和患者，同时跟他学习他的传统治疗术。除了喝热水，该治疗术还包括主要由植物构成的食谱。该原理认为，我们全身充满毒素，要想清洗，必须首先停止把更多的毒素带入体内。我亲眼见到有人用此办法在一周内体重减轻了10磅。这并不是禁食，而是喝热水，吃健康食品。我帮助王大夫在旧金山的Mission 区开办了他的诊所，随即搬到那里成为诊所第一个管理人。在诊所服务了一年之后，我开车穿越美国返回杜克，我发现传统的中国已经来到了北卡。
 
功夫—金
一到此地，我便找到了杜克太极俱乐部。这里的武术社区充满活力，绝不亚于当年我每天凌晨在中国的公园学太极拳所见的景象。杜克太极俱乐部由Ben Fisher 带领。Ben Fisher是Sam Chin 师傅的弟子，跟随他学习意力拳。我从那时开始就一直跟他们学。如今，这个俱乐部已经不属于杜克了。它的成员每周三次、 每次2 到3 小时练习单手拳和对手拳。Sam Chin 是我所从师的武术教练中对武术最精通的师傅。他具有奉献精神，他的学生来自世界各地。 
北卡意力拳社团是Durham 中国传统文化的一只独秀。我们的文化中心将举办定期的武术课和活动。
 
有机栽培—土
在中国居住期间，我最怀念的是未受破坏的自然。回到北卡，我又回归到大自然之中。我对户外运动的热爱和对健康饮食的承诺使我开始栽培有机植物。六年来，我耕种自家和杜克社区的菜园。我吃的大部分食品是我自己种的，其它的是Durham 农贸市场的新鲜农产品。就像中国传统文化，有机栽培是我身体和精神实践的一个组成部分。
我们的传统文化中心不仅会教大家怎样种植有机农产品，还教人们怎样靠它生活。我们还会提供自家种植的有机美食和水果的果汁。",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Our goal is to develop lifelong learners who are ready to meet their future academic and social challenges with success and confidence. As part of that goal, we know that our focus cannot only be on the child but must include the family and the community at large.

<div>Hi, I’m Jasmine Mattson a 12 year old student from North Carolina. This year I have been offered the chance of a lifetime… to be a delegate on a global service-learning experience to Ghana, West Africa, to learn, share, and work with African villages!  When I was about 5 I got a book about Africa and ever since then I was obsessed with it. It became a dream of mine to visit Africa and I have been offered the chance … to actually GO THERE, and to help!   I was ecstatic, but I don’t have the money ($2,200) to go so I am on a fundraising effort and my first deadline is on Friday.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In March 2013, our group of 7th and 8th grade delegates from Evergreen Community Charter School (ECCS; <a href=""http://evergreenccs.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">evergreenccs.org</a>) will embark on a 12-day global service-learning experience to Ghana, in partnership with Motherland International Relations (<a href=""http://motherlandinternational.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">motherlandinternational.org</a>). I need my first taste of the developing world like nothing else, and want to share the wonders of lifetime with the other curious children at my school.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In Africa, we will connect with students at The Esiam Heritge Academy, a progressive school in the heart of Ghana, to help initiate a new farming program for the 1,000 day-students at Heritage Academy. The farming program is the result of a Heritage Academy student-lead project aimed at developing sustainable solutions to the challenges of contemporary village life (<a href=""http://schoerkefoundation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">schoerkefoundation.org</a>).</div>
<div>The ECCS delegation will also work with AproTech, an organization dedicated to fostering sustainable and equitable development in Ghana and across Africa (<a href=""http://aprotechghana.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">aprotechghana.wordpress.com</a>). AproTech, created by Dr. Kofi Sam, a physics professor, government Secretary of Housing, and classmate of former UN Secretary Kofi Annan, is devoted to giving Africa's rural poor the right tools to make use of the resources around them so that they can work their own way out of poverty.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If I were you this would be great to donate to, because it’s not a simple trip somewhere it’s educating the young minds of the next generation. I know I have made a difference where I have gone before, but this is bigger than any goal I’ve pushed myself towards before. Just remember if you can’t donate that’s fine but it would be lovely if you spread the word to others that you think may be able to.

<p>(Please note that we cannot change the official ""goal"" of $30,000 as it is listed on this campaign. The true goal of this campaign now is $16,174 - $5,605 of which has been met at the time of this writing.) Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>My name is Ryan Knopper and I have created this campaign to help my friend Prince Otchere continue his education at Loma Linda University School of Medicine. Let me tell you more about him.</strong> </p>
<p>Imagine one day you fall ill and are in desperate nend of medical attention. None of us ever expect to be in this predicament, but if we are, we want to know that we are being cared for by the most <strong>knowledgeable and capable</strong> physician possible.  Someone who is <strong>caring, smart, intelligent</strong> and able to work with you to get you better.</p>
<p>This is exactly the type of physician that Prince Otchere is becoming. Having already completed his first year of medical school and excelling in his classes, he is on track to fulfill his dream and calling to become a physician who will meet the needs of underserved communities both here and abroad. </p>
<p>The only problem is that Prince’s path is threatened to be derailed due to financial need. As an intenational student from Ghana, Prince is not eligible for financial aid. As a first year student, he received a scholarship to cover part of tuition expenses and secured a private student loan to cover the rest. Thankfully, he has another scholarship and found a cosigner for much of the sophomore year.. However, he still needs to raise <strong>$10,569</strong> to make up the remainder. At present, he has truly exhausted all available options up to this point, including scholarships, loans, and gifts from family and friends. He has been in contact with the administration of the school and has worked hard to actively seek out resources and networking opportunities to finance his education. His efforts have brought him this far, but even after working with several cosigners, the circumstances of our current economy have made it difficult to secure private loans for the full amount necessary for him to be able to continue on in medical school with his class this coming fall.</p>
<p>Once he is finished with his 2<sup>nd</sup> year, the school will give him full institutional aid for his 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> years, so this is the time that we really need your assistance to help us collectively push Prince over this financial hump.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Contribute</strong></h2>
<p>Your donation will not only benefit a future physician, but all of the communities and families that Prince will come in contact with in the future around the world. This is an opportunity to give a gift that will have exponential dividends far beyond this moment. </p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>If you can not help financially, please help spread the word throughout your social networks, coworkers, church groups, friends and family. Indiegogo has some amazing tools that make sharing fast and easy. Prince can use any help you are willing to give.</p>
<h2><strong>Thank-you!</strong></h2>
<p>I would like to personally thank you for your time in reading about Prince's story.

UPDATE - PARTIAL SUCCESS!By God’s grace, I have successfully registered for the first Semester of the academic year. Through the effort of this campaign, a generous man has co-signed an amount that made my registration possible. I appreciate your prayers, contribution and support through this difficult time. Your words of encouragement and your zeal to help another in need have been inspiring. I am still short $16,174 for the Second half of the year. Because of your generous donation of $5600, what I actually need to raise now is $10,569 to cover the rest of the school year. Again, I thank God and everyone who has given of themselves to make sure that my dream comes true.

<h2 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>About the TAASC Dyslexia Project</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>It is believed that dyslexia can affect around 10 percent of a given population</p>
<p>Dyslexia is a learning disorder characterized by difficulty reading. The disorder is a specific information processing problem that does not interfere with one’s ability to think or understand complex ideas.</p>
<p>Dyslexic people are highly creative, intuitive, and excel at three-dimensional problem solving and hands-on learning. Unfortunately the core of our educational system and environment outside of school relies on reading, word recognition and decoding. These areas are of great struggle and difficulty for the dyslexic.</p>
<p>Because of this many students with dyslexia experience a loss of or low self-esteem. This can lead to behavior problems, anxiety, aggression and withdrawal from friends, parents and teachers. </p>
<h3>The TAASC impact </h3>
<p>We have found at TAASC that our students with dyslexia flourish. <a href=""http://www.ashevilletaasc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>TAASC is a youth based non profit (501(c)(3)</strong> </a>that combines wilderness leadership and service learning to create compassionate, capable leaders. For over 7 years we have been providing life changing experiences aimed at developing qualities essential to succeeding in life.</p>
<p>Parents of our dyslexic students comment on the changes they see in their kids. They grow in confidence and are able to transfer this confidence from their wilderness experiences to their school work. Their self-esteem develops as they master the skills required to travel, play, and learn in the wilderness. They are natural leaders and begin to see themselves for the strengths they possess rather than the disability they have.</p>
<p>The multi-sensory environment of the wilderness plays to their intellectual strengths  allowing them to believe in themselves as capable, bright leaders. The experiential nature of the wilderness allows them to have breakthrough successes they have not yet experienced at school or home.</p>
<p>We have been amazed at the impact of TAASC on students with dyslexia and would like to offer it to a larger number of students who struggle with the self doubt and sense of inadequacy that can be so paralyzing.</p>
<p><strong>Freya’s story from the video above</strong> is a great testimonial to the success of students with dyslexia participating in this program.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Funding Received for this Project will go directly to the following:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>specialized curriculum development for children with learning challenges</li>
<li>scholarship for students with dyslexia who would benefit from being in TAASC</li>
<li>an evaluation study, so we can track our results and keep improving what we do</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Your investment in a student with dyslexia will provide them with the following activities over the course of a year.</strong></h3>

<h2>Adolescents Breathe Peace in Prison</h2>
<p>My name is Lisa V. Blake and I am the founder of the Maine Mindfulness Project, a program I began in 2009 to teach the practice of meditation in a number of venues in the state of Maine.  The initial focus was to deliver meditation sessions in schools and medical settings to help children and people of all ages learn to use a simple breathing technique to create peace and expand inner space awareness, while also enjoying the side perk of the practice: alleviating stress and negativity.</p>
<p>In 2010, I was asked to start a program as a volunteer at the state's largest adolescent prison.  Due to the success of the work with over a hundred adolescent inmates who have gone through the meditation and yoga classes, the inmates have requested that we expand this project.</p>
<p>I will love to do just that with your kind support and generous help.  </p>
<p>This project is especially important to me because these children are the self described ""worst adolescent criminial offenderes in Maine,"" but under the veneer of the scared and hardened attitude are tender and confused hearts waiting for someone to teach them peace, love and happiness.  </p>
<p>This is what our meditation and yoga program does by helping them to learn how to feel safe and breathe peace.</p>
<p>The magnitude of what contributors will help us achieve is to create a more peaceful society by helping these young people understand themselves on a more profound level and that they do have other choices in life beyond violence and crime. Therefore, the whole community in the state benefits from truly rehabilitating and re-forming these young people.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have kept this volunteer project going on my own expense for over 2 years.  Recently i asked a yoga teacher to come on board and she is great!</p>
<p>We need to raise $12,000 to continue to add another teacher and expand the number of classes we offer in order to meet the demand from the adolescent inmates.</p>
<p> Currently, we have volunteered 5 hours each per week and have covered our own travel expenses for the past 2 years (over 100 miles per week).  In order to keep the program growing and successful, we are trying to offer 5 hours of instruction each week covering all the units and inmates.  </p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, we will use whatever funds are raised to expand the program as feasibly as possible.  I am also the Buddhist Chaplain at the prison.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our unique program is building a more peaceful society here in Maine and is a model that can be expanded and duplicated in other states and countries. By sharing love and happiness with youth who have not truly experienced much of either of these feelings we are truly able to help young people learn to love themselves and make better choices in the future.</p>
<p>Maine has the nation's lowest adolescent recidivism rate and it is due to engaged interaction with deeply troubled youth who are eager to learn better.  This program teaches them how to learn and feel better, pointing them inward in order to guide them outwardly in new directions. </p>
<p>I have taught meditation to thousands of people, many of them youth and teenagers.  No one has yet reported that they felt zero benefit or did not enjoy the experience. If we want world peace, we have to teach our children well how to live in peace.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Thank you for reading about our project.  If you are unable to help financially, please help us spread the word about our project to media or other folks who might be able to contribute.  Or just get excited that we are truly helping to make the lives of some imprisoned young people better for them, which ultimately will be better for us all.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p class=""p1"">In 2008 Camp Thunderbird South Dakota was founded by a few caring teachers at He Dog School on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Their intention was not to solve all of the problems faced by students growing up on the reservation, but to offer a tool to address them.</p>
<p class=""p1"">With support from He Dog School and the Boys and Girls Club of Rosebud, the camp was able to hold summer camp on the reservation and become a source of learning, leadership, and success for kids.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Now, the camp aims to grow and impact an increasing number of students.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3>
<p>In order for us to reach this goal, we need:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""p1"">
<strong>$1,500 to fund a stipend for a part-time, volunteer Camp Director</strong>.</li>
<li class=""p1"">Communicating with families, soliciting and vetting camper applications, scheduling activities, arranging for food and lodging, and recruiting and training staff -- that's hard work. Even harder when the same person is responsible soliciting donor and community support. <strong>We need a dedicated position to improve our effectiveness</strong>.</li>
<li class=""p1"">To make this position feasible for qualified candidates, we hope to cover living expenses for the weeks leading up to and following each camp, and provide a stipend for some of their service. This will allow us to begin this summer prepared to give campers the best experience possible.</li>
<li>Any money we raise through our IndieGoGo campaign will help to fund this position and improve the effectiveness of our organization.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p class=""p1"">Native American youth in South Dakota face poverty, substance abuse, gangs and parental neglect. The suicide rate for Native youth in the Great Plains is ten times the national average [1]. Not surprisingly, education is undermined. Native students trail their white peers by two to three grade levels in reading and math [2]. As one community member and aide at He Dog School on the Rosebud Reservation described, “There are so few opportunities here that can give our kids hope from a young age.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">Excitingly, small,<strong> targeted interventions focused on self-affirmation can feedback to have lasting impacts</strong> on academic achievement for those most at risk [3]. Camp Thunderbird works to provide educational, confidence-boosting, summer activities, that are otherwise not available in these remote rural areas. Because cultural pride is crucial, we work along side other community organizations and with community members to help foster cultural competency and pride. </p>

</p><p>With chapters on the prison industrial complex, hypocrisy of drug prohibition, politicians against prohibition, parents against prohibition, authors and pundits against prohibition, asset forfeiture,  international violence of the drug war and religious leaders against the drug war, this book is a scathing indictment of the war on drugs.</p>
<p>This book is about you, us, our reach towards ending this horrendous drug war.  When Eric Holder read his copy, he then forwarded it to the DEA to educate them as well.  This book would not exist without ARO, DPA, LEAP, the Baker Institute, DPFT, MPP, NORML and scores of other organizations and individuals who stepped up to the plate and took mighty swings at the logic of drug war.</p>
<p>We can use your help.  We will go to Washington DC and hand deliver nearly 600 copies of <i>To End The War on Drugs – A Guide for Politicians, the Press and Public</i> as soon as possible, likely around June 1, 2014.  This will be our ""summer reading assignment"" for these officials.  Once back in session, we will pull no punches regarding those who still choose to dismiss public safety by  still believing in drug war</p>
<p>We would like to include a “sign on” letter from your organization with each copy of the book that can include contact names, address and email.
</p><p>The cost to print, ship to our offices to attach individual letters for each elected official will be approximately $10 per book.  435 Representatives, 100 Senators, the President and 50 US Governors gives a total of 586 books.  585 X 10 = $5,860.00 needed to deliver these books.</p>
<p>We have in mind to contact all news teams in Houston area, capture scenes of three generations of our family printing, labeling, stuffing and prepping the books for shipment.  We will put these scenes on flash drives to give reporters when we hold our press conference in D.C.  Thus far we have the support of the James A.

</p><p>Hie,
I’m Emmanuel,<span>  I’m going to be the new
principal of a school.. Imagine, how cool that is.. </span></p>
<p>Now,
let’s get right into my story. I’m a freelance web designer and technician.. In
the beginning of this year, I took a trip to Sodwana Bay, in Kwazulu Natal and
also went through a place called Mbazwana where the interesting part started.. </p>
<p>Let
me tell you about Sodwana Bay first, this place has got a beautiful beach with
lots of scenery, but that’s not what captured my attention, you see, the
literacy rate in this place is so low that I could not believe it , I’m from Johannesburg,<span>  the city of gold where they is everything at
your fingertips (and everyone can speak English , in this place, there is almost
close to nothing , it’s a small rural town in the middle of nowhere (not exactly) .. Take a look at Sodwana bay itself <a href=""https://www.google.co.za/search?q=sodwana+bay&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=55_TU4GXH4TH7Ab1xYGQCg&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=679#imgdii=_"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here </a></span></p>
<p>My
mission here is to educate .. Now, I teamed up with several friends
from Johannesburg and we all came down here.. we hunted for a place to start our little

<h1><b>Will
you help us? </b></h1>
<br/></div>","Hie,
I’m Emmanuel,  I’m going to be the new
principal of a school.. Imagine, how cool that is.. 
Now,
let’s get right into my story. I’m a freelance web designer and technician.. In
the beginning of this year, I took a trip to Sodwana Bay, in Kwazulu Natal and
also went through a place called Mbazwana where the interesting part started.. 
Let
me tell you about Sodwana Bay first, this place has got a beautiful beach with
lots of scenery, but that’s not what captured my attention, you see, the
literacy rate in this place is so low that I could not believe it , I’m from Johannesburg,  the city of gold where they is everything at
your fingertips (and everyone can speak English , in this place, there is almost
close to nothing , it’s a small rural town in the middle of nowhere (not exactly) .. Take a look at Sodwana bay itself here 
My
mission here is to educate .. Now, I teamed up with several friends
from Johannesburg and we all came down here.. we hunted for a place to start our little
venture and after speaking to the wonderful Mayor of Mbazwana , Mr Ncube , he
gave us a place behind the library, that was used as a school before but was
abandoned (or so I think) .. What exactly are we going to be teaching here ? We took a good look around the local town and surrounding areas and realized that most people around here were ranging from ages  20 - 40 on average had either not made it to Grade 12 or failed ... This is where we came to a conclusion where the school will be a Matric finishing school .. We will be giving those who either never made it to Grade 12 or those who wish to re-write their grade 12 and also we are going to include a computer school with subjects starting from Introduction to computers (for the beginners  going all the way to advanced computing ..  How will it help the community ? Take a look at it from this angle , in South Africa, without a Grade 12 or any computer knowledge chances are slim (very very small, think about ameoba proteus small) that you will either get a job or pretty much do anything after that, and we are not even talking about college or university here because there is a minimum pass rate for that .. So in short, our school will be a bridge to those that never made it .. Giving them the second chance to go try again and aim higher .. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What we did here 
The
place was in ruins, so we cleaned it up and turned it into what now looks like
a school.. Now the problem is, we have exhausted all our savings that we put on
this because we never imagined that starting a school can cost so much (so much
for raising a building from the ruins)...Why only $5000 ? Isn't that too little ? Well, as a matter of fact, if this whole project was depending on $5000 it was not going to be accomplished ..As for the ""why"" part , after doing all the math (thanks to our Mathematician , she is good in numbers) we realized that in order to jump the finish line ( we almost there, but stuck at the moment) , we are only short about $5000 that roughly translates to ZAR 53 000 in South African currency .. You Sure ? : Yes we are sure .. 100% Sure

is the part where we need your help ….

</h2><p>The Live Learn &amp; Play concept was formed in December 2009 after Jill VanKuren, a professional in the field, grew frustrated with the lack of (and non-existence of) resources, activities, and just fun places in general to recommend to families with Autism and special needs. There was a huge need for a place of acceptance for kids of all ability levels, a place for resources for families and professionals, and a place for parents to come and just be able to relax. She created the concept that became Live Learn &amp; Play. Investors took on the concept and opened a center which closed due to unrelated financial problems of the investors. Because of the overwhelming community support and love for Live Learn &amp; Play, it was established as a 501c3 non-profit organization officially in September 2012. We are raising funds to continue our mission and re-open this amazing center for our families. We are VERY close to reaching our goal! :)<br/></p><p>Sections of the Center &amp; Key Features:<br/></p><ul>

<li>“I just had my son's 4th birthday at Live Learn 
&amp; Play. I usually try and avoid taking him out in public due to his 
Autism and ADHD. But his 4th birthday was awesome!! He was able to play,
 have fun and just be himself! I didn't have to worry about explaining 
to typical children's parents why my son acts the way he does or 
apologize to them for my son doing something to their child. I got to 
meet other parents that are going through the same struggle my family 
is. It is a wonderful place and there is no place around here that even 
closely compares to Live Learn and Play. This is the perfect, safe 
environment for children like my son and we are so thankful we finally 
have a place to go and play.”- Nicole F. (June 2012)<br/>
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
<p>“Unless
 you are a parent of a child with special needs, it is nearly impossible
 to describe the feeling when one finds a warm and accepting haven like 
Live, Learn &amp; Play. The freedom to let our kids be who they are 
without worry or judgment is a precious gift, and their (and our) smiles
 speak more than words ever could. Live, Learn &amp; Play is an 
invaluable addition to the Allentown community.”- Deb H. (July 2012)</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
<p>“Live
 Learn &amp; Play is a great resource for both my son with autism &amp; 
my daughter who is neurotypical. They both enjoy attending open play 
times! It is wonderful to have a place that is welcoming, accepting, and
 understanding of my son's needs and behaviors. And my daughter enjoys 
playing there so much that she requested to have her upcoming birthday 
at LL&amp;P. I love having an inclusive community resource that works so
 well for both of them!”- Tracy B. (July 2012)</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>“Bottom
 Line--there are places to play in the valley; there are places for 
therapy in the valley. But there is NO PLACE where my kids can engage in
 therapeutic play in a safe, encouraging environment. There is NO PLACE 
where I know my kids can be kids and I can turn my head and not wonder 
what might happen. There is NO PLACE where I can feel safe letting my 
daughter be herself without the stares and awkward moments from other 
parents. Thank you LLP for taking the risk and opening! Thank you for 
being here.”- Christa H. (June 2012)</p>

<p>“My
 daughter is 3 and is in the autism spectrum. She has a speech delay and
 sensory issues. After only a few weeks of attending the summer program 
at Live Learn &amp; Play, we notice she is saying a lot more words and 
is more social. There's no other place in the area where she can 
interact with other kids while being exposed to sensory play.  And she 
loves it - when I drop her off she runs into the building and the other 
kids hug her when they see her!”- Nicole B. (June 2012)</p>

<p>“I
 can not live without Live Learn &amp; Play! Though my constant request 
to just move in with my children is denied, we return on a regular basis
 for open play. I am the mother of 2 sons on the Autism spectrum ages 6 
and 5. My 6 year old is high functioning and has ADHD as well. LLP 
provides a safe and understanding environment where he can run to his 
heart's content. I don't need to worry about him hurting himself when he
 falls (and he ALWAYS falls) because they were mindful enough to provide
 a play area with a padded floor. The staff is knowledgeable on the 
condition of Autism and other special needs. They go the extra mile for 
our special children. My younger son is non verbal and prone to 
aggressive meltdowns, and sometimes bangs his head. I am extra grateful 
for the padded floors when it comes to him! Because there are other 
families present living with special needs, we don't become a spectacle 
when negative behaviors happen. For example, if I was at a McDonald's 
play place, my son could bust his head wide open on the floor.....while 
the parents stand around judging how my bad child is a product of my bad
 parenting. The average typical family is clueless of our challenges. I 
am comforted by how supportive and helpful the staff and parents are and
 how quickly they come to help. It is an unspoken ""rule"" amongst us to 
help each other. Everything about LLP is wonderful. I finally have a 
place to take my kids to play! A place like this is long overdue.”- Charissa T. (July 2012)<br/></p>

</div>
</div><div> <p>Our residents at Matthew House Ottawa: Refugee Services have many incredibly stressful and pressure-making things to do in the first few months of arriving in Canada.

<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are always risk &amp; challenges in any fundraising opportunity. To overcome some of these risks and challenges we have picked the flexible funding model which guarantees we get money to go to the fair either way. This may mean the residents may not get to go on any rides, it also may mean some residents may not even get to come. Therefore we really would love your support in helping us take all of our residents to the fair!</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you cannot contribute monetarily, the second best way to contribute is to get the word out there and make some noise about our campaign. Tell everyone, even if they are out of province, state, country, etc, every little bit will help!</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary

What is Matthew House Ottawa: Refugee Services? We are part of a growing network founded to help refugee claimants by providing a place to live while they attempt to build a future in Canada. Matthew House Ottawa: Refugee Services is able to provide short-term accommodation for up to 10 refugee claimants along with assistance in settling into life in Ottawa. Our goal is to connect a large range of services to refugee claimants who seek our assistance. We are not just a transient place to live but a real home supported by caring individuals; a place where people can know they are among friends and feel at peace.
We want to take our residents the Carp Fair to give them a typical Canadian experience! There will be a lot of Canadian culture, food, agriculture as well as a bunch of rides and games that the residents can try and experience.  
Your contributions will be greatly appreciated by not only the refugees themselves but also Matthew House Ottawa: Refugee Services staff and volunteers; they will never forget this amazing, Canadian experience!   What We Need & What You Get We need money to help cover the costs of admission, food, ride tickets and gas for our resident refugees at Matthew House Ottawa: Refugee Services but also for a couple volunteers to come along to drive and help co-ordinate the outing.

The Impact

 Our residents at Matthew House Ottawa: Refugee Services have many incredibly stressful and pressure-making things to do in the first few months of arriving in Canada. This would be none other than a great Canadian experience for them but also a day where they can let loose, have fun, smile & enjoy themselves!

  Risks & Challenges There are always risk & challenges in any fundraising opportunity. To overcome some of these risks and challenges we have picked the flexible funding model which guarantees we get money to go to the fair either way. This may mean the residents may not get to go on any rides, it also may mean some residents may not even get to come. Therefore we really would love your support in helping us take all of our residents to the fair!

<h3>Round 1 (completed)<br/>
</h3>We spent $230,000 for legal fees, much of it raised here, that took us through the critical hearing last month with Justice Bannon of the NY State Supreme Court. We hope, based on the strength of our petition and oral arguments, that she will: reverse the imposition of tuition; remove errant Board members; order formation of The Associates of Cooper Union (as called for in the Trust); and begin an audit of the school's finances. But even then, we must continue to fund the legal effort.</div><div>
<br/><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px;"">Round 2: Our goal is to raise at least $100,000 for the second round of legal action.</span><br/></p>
<p>If Justice Bannon rules for The Committee to Save Cooper Union we must be prepared to defend that decision against appeal (and if she rules against, we will mount an appeal). We don't know when her ruling will come down, so therefore time is of the essence. Whatever the outcome, it is almost certain that a final, binding decision will require additional steps. Thanks to a generous $25,000 donation from Cooper alum Adam Forbes, we are off to an excellent start - the remaining goal is $75,000. We need your continued support and faith in the true Cooper Union for what might be a protracted legal battle. We should take heed from Lincoln’s own words in Cooper Union's Great Hall on February 27, 1860 - ""Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.""</p>

<br/><h3>Fundraising Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>This ""Appeal"" Indiegogo campaign is part of the Phase 2 of our fundraising as discussed in our first Indiegogo campaign.<br/>
</li>
<li>So far our legal fee expenditures have been: $50,000 for the initial petition and $180,000 for subsequent petitions and representation through the hearing, for a total of $230,000 in legal fees. The fixed fee arrangements we negotiated with our attorneys have resulted in a substantial discount to their normal hourly rates. We have other costs as well, including expenses such as our public relations firm, which has helped us generate support for our cause.</li>
<li>All members and officers of Committee to Save Cooper Union have put in their time and efforts on an unpaid volunteer basis.</li>
<li>We will still need to raise additional funds to complete our action and are working on other fundraising initiatives.</li>
<li>Regarding tax deductibility of donations: Committee to Save Cooper Union is a non-profit corporation, but we don't yet have 501c3 status for tax deductibility. We are working on a fiscal sponsorship arrangement which would enable tax deductibility for certain donations. Please contact us for issues related to this.<br/>
</li>
<li>If our goal of preserving a free tuition Cooper Union is achieved, 
any remaining funds will be donated back to Cooper Union. If the goal is
 not achieved, any remaining funds will be donated to a worthy 
educational cause.<br/>

</div></div>","The legal action to stop the destruction of Peter Cooper's free college is being waged by a coalition of faculty, alumni, and students—joined by a broad community that is angered at the injustice of 155 years of free tuition ending in order to fund wasteful administrative bloat, misguided empire building, and questionable fiscal practices.



Life or Death for Cooper Union




Cooper Union receives income of over $20 million a year because of a tax exemption on commercial property owned by the school that was granted because the NY State Legislature believed that Cooper Union's free school, although private, was operating for the public's good. This tax exemption is essential to the Cooper Union’s survival.   The imposition of tuition by the Board of Trustees jeopardizes this tax exemption, which is worth far more than what their tuition scheme brings in. 

“The tax benefits that have accrued to Cooper Union are based on maintaining the mandate for free tuition. It is critical to the future access to higher education for deserving students that that commitment be maintained.""

-- State Assemblywoman Deborah Glick 

""What's at stake here is if the free tuition is scrapped, then we in the legislature have to reconsider, I think, our position in affording a property tax break to Cooper Union. Let's be clear, no other private institution in New York currently receives such a tax break…""

-- State Senator Brad Hoylman
Just as the State legislature had the power to provide Peter Cooper with a massive tax subsidy to promote his vision of free education, it has the power to take it away.
The Cooper Union Board of Trustees has pursued the reckless course of charging tuition, thus endangering the very existence of the school. They should have worked with the dedicated community of faculty, alumni, and students to scale back runaway administrative spending and get Cooper Union back to a prudent course of living within its means as outlined in the Working Group plan. 

We have no choice but to continue legal action as they have rejected all alternative paths (including Trustee Jeffrey Gural’s offer to donate up to $2,000,000 to buy time to refine an alternative approach.) Please help!


Powerful Allies
We have gained powerful allies as the facts have come out, including State Senator Brad Hoylman and State Assembly member Deborah Glick (Chair of the Higher Education Committee). The Daily News, NY Post, NY Times, and PIX Ch. 11 News have taken notice and amplified our voice. Andrew Rossi's documentary, Ivory Tower, featured our struggle and explained how it is part of a larger national crisis in higher education where tuition costs and student debt are spiraling out of control. We need your help to sustain our efforts and preserve free education at Cooper Union for future generations.(Video below includes footage of Senator Hoylman speaking at our press event.)





Round 1 (completed)
We spent $230,000 for legal fees, much of it raised here, that took us through the critical hearing last month with Justice Bannon of the NY State Supreme Court. We hope, based on the strength of our petition and oral arguments, that she will: reverse the imposition of tuition; remove errant Board members; order formation of The Associates of Cooper Union (as called for in the Trust); and begin an audit of the school's finances. But even then, we must continue to fund the legal effort.
Round 2: Our goal is to raise at least $100,000 for the second round of legal action.
If Justice Bannon rules for The Committee to Save Cooper Union we must be prepared to defend that decision against appeal (and if she rules against, we will mount an appeal). We don't know when her ruling will come down, so therefore time is of the essence. Whatever the outcome, it is almost certain that a final, binding decision will require additional steps. Thanks to a generous $25,000 donation from Cooper alum Adam Forbes, we are off to an excellent start - the remaining goal is $75,000. We need your continued support and faith in the true Cooper Union for what might be a protracted legal battle. We should take heed from Lincoln’s own words in Cooper Union's Great Hall on February 27, 1860 - ""Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.""
 
  



Fundraising Information

This ""Appeal"" Indiegogo campaign is part of the Phase 2 of our fundraising as discussed in our first Indiegogo campaign.

So far our legal fee expenditures have been: $50,000 for the initial petition and $180,000 for subsequent petitions and representation through the hearing, for a total of $230,000 in legal fees. The fixed fee arrangements we negotiated with our attorneys have resulted in a substantial discount to their normal hourly rates. We have other costs as well, including expenses such as our public relations firm, which has helped us generate support for our cause.
All members and officers of Committee to Save Cooper Union have put in their time and efforts on an unpaid volunteer basis.
We will still need to raise additional funds to complete our action and are working on other fundraising initiatives.
Regarding tax deductibility of donations: Committee to Save Cooper Union is a non-profit corporation, but we don't yet have 501c3 status for tax deductibility. We are working on a fiscal sponsorship arrangement which would enable tax deductibility for certain donations. Please contact us for issues related to this.

If our goal of preserving a free tuition Cooper Union is achieved, 
any remaining funds will be donated back to Cooper Union. If the goal is
 not achieved, any remaining funds will be donated to a worthy 
educational cause.

hard working with his studies and wishes to pursue a professional career as a

received  a loan for a french violin made in 1848

 That’s me! - Ian Howland. I am 18 years old, also from Victoria BC. Since a young age, I have had a passion in art and animation.
Although I have also played violin for many years alongside my brother, my
focus rests in the art field.Recently, I got accepted into a
prestigious summer school program in Paris, France, at Gobelins. I was one of few
international students to be accepted. Taking this step would be a great leap
towards my dream career- to be a film animator.However, we are in a dilemma! With me and my brother’s busking money, our mother is only able to pay for half
of the fees. That’s why we are hoping that you could support us, and to help us
reach our goals.What We Need & What You Get We are
hoping to raise the amount needed for
Ryan to
study violin in Switzerland  
Ian to
be able to partake in the Gobelins Summer School program of 2014.
All the
money raised will be going directly to these things, regardless of how much is
fund-raised in the end! A few general things that the money will be put towards
includes money for the train ride into Switzerland, money for food, metro
tickets for two weeks, the violin and animation programs themselves, and
student living costs. (Please scroll to the bottom for specific details) Perk Previews-------------------------->> Deviantart Portfolio<<---------------------------------------------------------->>Violin performances<<--------------------------------The Impact: 
We both have big goals. Ryan has dreams to become a violinist, and to be at the top of the musical world. I have dreams to become an animator and to work in a good field. If we are able to get some help from others with peoples' donations, it will help us to start accomplishing our goals. Even though we have been held back financially until now, it has never stopped us from working towards our future careers. As shown in the video above, we were interviewed recently (June 18) about our cause.

However, my piano teaching income can only afford minimum costs to support my
sons. So, I have made a decision ... That is to sell my house to 

pay for both
Ian's art school in Paris for 3 years and 


Ryan's violin study in Switzerland
and Italy.  

Nevertheless, the seller's market has been
very low that I am not yet able to sell my house to support my sons in time. I have been taking a chance-I keep my hope of selling my house

It was her attempt to provide young kids with their own books and the start of their personal library. As a young native girl growing up in Northern New Mexico, Lita and her seven brothers and sisters had no books in there home. Dr. Lita Mathews believes in early childhood literacy as a key to academic and social success.</strong></div><div><strong>Since Dr. Lita began the book giveaway she has been able to reach over 500 young native kids each year. The total amount of books given has reached three thousand books. Thus providing each child with several brand new books.</strong></div><div><strong>For many years the books were donated by various groups such as Disney and others. However those donations have gone away. It is important for Dr. Lita to reach out at this time for help to continue this wonderful and fantastic educational effort.</strong></div><div>

</div></div>","Short SummaryIn 1998 Dr. Lita Mathews began the Book Give Away, at the annual Gathering of Nations Pow Wow in Albuquerque, to young Native American boys and girls. It was her attempt to provide young kids with their own books and the start of their personal library. As a young native girl growing up in Northern New Mexico, Lita and her seven brothers and sisters had no books in there home. Dr. Lita Mathews believes in early childhood literacy as a key to academic and social success.Since Dr. Lita began the book giveaway she has been able to reach over 500 young native kids each year. The total amount of books given has reached three thousand books. Thus providing each child with several brand new books.For many years the books were donated by various groups such as Disney and others. However those donations have gone away. It is important for Dr. Lita to reach out at this time for help to continue this wonderful and fantastic educational effort.
note: The Gathering of Nations, a non profit organization, produces the annual Gathering of Nations Pow Wow in Albuquerque New Mexico each April.

<h3><span>Short Summary</span></h3>
<p>Mellow Pages Library &amp; Reading Room was founded in early February of 2013. Our original space, which was 200 square feet, quickly became recognized as a center for small press, independent and underground literature as well as a vital source for readings and literary gatherings. Following a storm of positive media attention, including the L Magazine, The New York Times and TimeOut New York, we received an outpouring of support and books which caused us to quickly outgrow our space. In July, we made a gamble on our new home, a huge (to us) 400 square foot corner studio in the same building, 56 Bogart. This is an ideal space for both our collection and our event programming, and was a necessary investment for the continuation and expansion of the community we created.</p>
<br/><p>What's most important about this project is the idea that powerful community spaces can be created and sustained by the same communities they support. Mellow Pages is a functional library with over 200 members, and has always been an entirely free resource to the people who wish to use it. We will be keeping it that way. During our experimental first months it was up to us to prove whether or not we could handle the job. We took on that challenge because we were passionate about our idea and felt that a space free of consumer pressures was amiss in the neighborhood. Nothing is for sale in Mellow Pages, everyone is welcome, and you are free to read and work as you wish. </p>
<br/><p>Now that it’s clear Mellow Pages Library is a worthwhile project, we agree it’s time to share the responsibility with those also up for the challenge. Thus far, we have funded the space ourselves, which has been a task we’ve enjoyed struggling through. But after countless strangers asking for ways they can help, this seems like a sensible option. We would love to continue taking on a greater schedule of events, housing more dynamic workshops like Words After War, and supporting the readership of small presses throughout the country. To do this we will need your help. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to be as transparent as possible here. Our goal of 20,000 dollars nominally reflects our needs over the course of one year, 15,000 of which solely amounts to the rent. Don’t get discouraged by this number. Whether or not we reach this goal is not contingent on continuing the dream. We will persevere, as we already have. That said, every dollar helps. </p>
<p>This monetary request represents the latest facet of the experiment: we want to make as big an influence as we can, as positive, to create the best small press experience possible. We are exploring our options. We would like the ability to buy the books we house straight from the publishers (publishers who have thus far donated at their own expense). We want the freedom to begin writing workshops of our own and reading groups with extended hours, to make a more tangible impact. We want proper shelving and proper heating. We want you to be comfortable as well as taken care of. We want some good coffee, and we want to provide that coffee free of charge. The corners of our imagination are bulging here. If we get enough, who knows? A nice camera to record readings? An archive of those readings? (a true to gosh website?) A screen to project movies upon? A karaoke machine that only has poetry? Let us explore.</p>
<p>Our ability to accomplish these things will depend on what we can raise. Sure, we would love to secure a year of rent, and on top of that, extend the goodness. Like we said, everything helps. Our goal is to offer everyone the chance to transform the neighborhood and hopefully alter some of the stigmas surrounding community spaces much like ours (spaces we think will spread if we can set a good enough example).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here is exactly what your money will help us accomplish:</p>
<p>1) $15,000 secures the future rent of Mellow Pages for exactly one year, allows us to focus on our event programming and frees up time to establish writing workshops and reading groups at extended hours. It also allows us to create a functional website.</p>
<p>2) $20,000 gives us the ability to go on a small press book buying spree (~$2,000) which will allow us to financially support the work we are passionate about and give back to the people who helped us along the way. It will also allow us to build the space to our desires, establish proper shelving and archive our readings for future consumption.</p>
<p>3) $20,000+ We begin to support the people who run and manage the space daily (7 days a week) whose time and energy help produce the programming of events and workshops, the upkeep of the space, the organization of the catalogue and the turnover of checkouts and memberships. If anyone is supportive of providing a small wage to the people who run and established Mellow Pages, these funds will extremely alter our lives. Your generosity will go further than you know, and we thank you for your support.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please, please share this campaign and help us reach our goal! Anything within your power will give us a positive boost, so fear not!</p>
<p>If you have other services you'd like to provide or donate, please do! Everything is welcome and helpful. If you have the skills to help us build, please let us know. If you have heaters, refrigerators, shelves, wood, tools, etc. we would love to share. Know that aside from money there are many ways you can help, and of course we are always eager to receive books of all kinds. Thank You!</p>

Don’t get discouraged by this number. Whether or not we reach this goal is not contingent on continuing the dream. We will persevere, as we already have. That said, every dollar helps. 
This monetary request represents the latest facet of the experiment: we want to make as big an influence as we can, as positive, to create the best small press experience possible. We are exploring our options. We would like the ability to buy the books we house straight from the publishers (publishers who have thus far donated at their own expense). We want the freedom to begin writing workshops of our own and reading groups with extended hours, to make a more tangible impact. We want proper shelving and proper heating. We want you to be comfortable as well as taken care of. We want some good coffee, and we want to provide that coffee free of charge. The corners of our imagination are bulging here. If we get enough, who knows? A nice camera to record readings? An archive of those readings? (a true to gosh website?) A screen to project movies upon? A karaoke machine that only has poetry? Let us explore.
Our ability to accomplish these things will depend on what we can raise. Sure, we would love to secure a year of rent, and on top of that, extend the goodness. Like we said, everything helps. Our goal is to offer everyone the chance to transform the neighborhood and hopefully alter some of the stigmas surrounding community spaces much like ours (spaces we think will spread if we can set a good enough example).

Here is exactly what your money will help us accomplish:
1) $15,000 secures the future rent of Mellow Pages for exactly one year, allows us to focus on our event programming and frees up time to establish writing workshops and reading groups at extended hours. It also allows us to create a functional website.
2) $20,000 gives us the ability to go on a small press book buying spree (~$2,000) which will allow us to financially support the work we are passionate about and give back to the people who helped us along the way. It will also allow us to build the space to our desires, establish proper shelving and archive our readings for future consumption.
3) $20,000+ We begin to support the people who run and manage the space daily (7 days a week) whose time and energy help produce the programming of events and workshops, the upkeep of the space, the organization of the catalogue and the turnover of checkouts and memberships. If anyone is supportive of providing a small wage to the people who run and established Mellow Pages, these funds will extremely alter our lives. Your generosity will go further than you know, and we thank you for your support.

<h3>The Play-To-Learn Story</h3>
<strong>In 2009, Leora Lazarus quit her job as a teacher and started a free program for the families that could not afford to attend a regular preschool. The program has grown from one class of 22 children to over 1,200 families a year. They call her Teacher Lee.<br/></strong><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>Teacher Lee was shocked by the number children who were starting Kindergarten not knowing how to cut or hold a

for many children. They are set up for 
failure in a school system that emphasizes academics and testing. The Play-To-Learn program gives every child the tools to flourish and succeed, no matter who they are and what their circumstances.<br/></p>
<p>Teacher Lee Play-To-Learn is a truly unique FREE preschool program that does two wonderful things:

<ol>

Moldova – a beautiful country in the Eastern Europe. I am happily married with
Sergiu and we’re expecting a baby this summer :)))I work as Human Resources Manager
in a small company that operates in constructions and telecommunications.Every day I see Young people with an university degree
searching for a job.  Unfortunately, in Moldova
Young  people have difficulties getting a
job, and this is because they lack practical skills which the majority of our colleges
and universities don’t provide.  Also, we
see that most of the families lack the possibility to provide their children with
activities that develop their creativity and other skills. During the last 10 months I found out
that I can do more for the people in Moldova. Me and my husband started to look
out for a great Idea that will bring happiness, peace and knowledge
both for children and for the adults.The best Idea is to have one place where you can relax, play, work and get free tea and cookies. Irina, a talented  designer, helped us create the design of our Dream Cafe (it grew up in a wonderful dream). You probably wonder Why PUZZLE? Why the colors brown, purple and
yellow? 
Well, a Puzzle is a combination from several pieces that create a clear
picture. This is what we would like to do: put together the right pieces and
create a shared space designed both for work and fun.  
Regarding the colors, we combine brown, purple and yellow to create a space
filled with love and happiness. YELLOW brings the Sun inside the room,PURPLE represents the union between wisdom and love and BROWN emanates spiritual warmth.
""It feels like home in our Puzzle Time Café. Here we work on our
projects or prepare for exams, advance our start-up or find new team members,
chat with friends or play board games. We have separate areas for each of these
activities"".

Our goal
is to create one place where we will organize conferences,
competitions, workshops, entertainments and many more activities both
for children and for the adults. We want to start with an English Club for
children and one for adults, a Research Club and an HR Club. Besides this we
want to make a small library and a game room. Having all of these activities
along with free cookies and tea, each month, 100 children and adults will have
new opportunities to enrich their life.
What We Need & What You Get
We found this great 100 m² Place, located in Chisinau. Now that we
have the project ready, it's time to set up the Puzzle wall, bring in the
furniture and electronic appliances and spread the word about our
delicious cookies.
We did the math and came up with a bill of 20 000 $.
In Moldova, our modest salary empowers us to get only a limited loan from
the bank. This covers about 4500 $.
We need to cover the amount of 15500$.
We can not do this without the help of our supporters,
though.  As employees, we really only make enough money to make ends meet.
We could wait until we can afford it ourselves, but our friends and family have
encouraged us to at least give this a shot.  Would you be willing to contribute from $5 to $150 to
help us reach this goal?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Emanuel (E.R.) Carpenter.  My goal is not only to help salespeople and small business owners become sales prospecting experts so that they can earn more money for their families but to help adults learn to read in the process.  I started my company Cold Call Sensei and wrote the book ""How to Dominate in Cold Calling &amp; Earn Six Figures Doing It"" to do just that.</p>
<p>Here's a little more about me:</p>
<ul>
<li>The only sales prospecting expert in the world who used to be a BUYER  and a sales GATEKEEPER and still makes up to 80 cold calls per day.</li>
<li>10 years experience prospecting for brands such as Salesforce.com, Freightliner, and SAP.</li>
<li>Author of TWO Amazon.com bestselling ebooks on sales prospecting.</li>
<li>Winner of the National Sales Network's 2012 Sales Impact Award.</li>
<li>Volunteer tutor for adult literacy programs that helps people learn to read and get their GEDs.</li>
<li>Proud U.S. Air Force Gulf War Veteran</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Need From You:</h3>
<p>My Amazon.com Ebook, ""How to Dominate in Cold Calling &amp; Earn Six Figures Doing It"" has made an impact for small business owners and sales professionals around the world.  The challenge is that only 20% of book readers have devices for electronic reading.  So they have been asking me to publish a paperback edition.  The funds from this campaign will help pay for the publishing and shipping of 200 copies of that limited-edition book to sales professionals and small business owners looking for a way to earn more money for their families.  A portion of the proceeds will also be donated to Literacy Forsyth where I volunteer as a tutor.   </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contributors to this campaign will not only benefit from this wonderful book on sales prospecting but they will also have the opportunity to get one or all of these extras:</p>
<p>A chance to make a difference in the lives of many adults who struggle with the challenges of learning to read to better themselves.</p>
<p>A free copy of the Amazon.com bestselling eBook ""Ask: The Life-Changing Secret to Success in Sales and in Life.""</p>
<p>50% off of our popular, 100-Question Sales Prospecting Assessment that tests prospecting skills, objection-handling skills, and more.</p>
<p>A chance to save $400.00 on our meticulously researched, Fortune 500 Sales Prospecting list.  It's the only list we make and use for our own sales prospecting needs, complete with the names of five top executives, email addresses, revenue, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus material</strong> on <strong>getting past gatekeepers</strong> and <strong>navigating through voicemail systems</strong> not available in the eBook.  </p>
<p>The opportunity to feel good about supporting a 100% veteran-owned company.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>No money?  No problem.  You can still help by doing one of the following:</p>
<p>Tell the salespeople and small business owners in your life about this campaign.</p>
<p>Write a review of the eBooks mentioned here that you've already purchased on Amazon.com, BN.com, or Smashwords.com.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary

<h1><b>IT’S MEDIA’S MOMENT!</b></h1>
<p>Join with NAMAC in telling the story of who we are as a media
arts community. </p>
<p>As the established field-service organization for the
independent media arts sector, <a href=""http://namac.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>the National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture</a>
launched <a href=""http://namac.org/mapping"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Mapping the Field in 2010</a>, to gather empirical data about the depth
and scope of the work of the independent media arts sector. By 2013, we had
surveyed over 500 arts leaders and organizations. The surveys yielded
impressive and robust data about community engagement, salaries, revenue
sources, staffing, and more! </p>
<p>We want to bring this data to life as a living, breathing
story about who we are as a field, a story that you can use to demonstrate your
impact to stakeholders, funders, and your communities. </p>
<p>That’s why we need you to join us in this endeavor to produce a dynamic, interactive
data visualization to illustrate the value of the media arts at the local and
national levels. Our members and allies shared data on 536 organizations and
artists from 46 states, and 7 sovereign Indian nations, and we want to make
sense of that data with you. </p>
<p>Here are just a few of the ways we envision this data can be
displayed and utilized to support your work: </p>
<p><span>●<span> 
</span></span><b><i>Convince funders and stakeholders of your
value!</i> </b>You’ll be able to show, in graphs and charts designed for easy searching and analysis, that you
are connected to over 500 organizations that annually reach over 100 million
viewers and listeners with work similar to what you create at your
organization.</p>
<p><span>●<span> 
</span></span><b><i>Demonstrate your impact on the economy!</i> </b>Our respondents have operating budgets that
total over $403 million a year. All this information can be viewable and
searchable by zip codes.</p>
<p><span>●<span>  </span></span><b><i>Compare salary ranges!</i> </b>You can search what
organizations -- with comparable annual operating budgets -- are paying for key
staff positions across the country. </p>
<p><span>●<span> 
</span></span><b><i>Organize key information visually! </i></b>Use compelling visual data to tell your story.</p>
<p>This is a project by and for the media arts community. Our
network mobilizes the power of community through media creation, media
literacy, and bringing untold stories to light. We touch the lives of 100 million people annually. Bringing this data to life shows the vitality
of who we are as a sector, what makes us uniquely different from corporate
media, and why the vibrancy of the work we create for social change and
creative expression is unparalleled. </p>
<p>Supporting this campaign will bring a powerful new tool into the
world for you and give you a chance to show your love of the media arts
community and the role NAMAC plays in supporting your passion.</p>
<h2><b>WHAT WE NEED </b></h2>
<p>We need $56,000 to make this happen. What that supports is $27,500 to engage the
amazing design firm <a href=""http://www.builtbycivilization.com/company/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Civilization</a>. But
don’t take our word for it, look at the fantastic work they created for other
clients.  <br/></p>
<p>An additional
$24,000 is required to support the NAMAC team for 4 months while we develop,
create and publish our work. And then
there’s the $4,5000 in fees we pay to IndieGoGo for providing the platform to
bring this campaign to you.</p>
<h2><b>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</b></h2>
<p>As a network, we now have social media tools available to us
that we could not have imagined ten years ago. You can extend your support to our campaign by using Indiegogo’s share
tools to reach your networks through Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and whatever
else may be created during our campaign. If you can take a little time during
each week of the campaign to share the message, be in touch to get the support
you need. If you want to see this
project live, spread the word!</p>
<h2><b>ABOUT NAMAC</b></h2>
<p>The National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture – NAMAC −
energizes independent voices throughout the media arts (film, video, digital
and audio arts). Founded in 1980, NAMAC was created by an eclectic group of
media arts organizations from different regions who realized that together they
represented a stronger social and cultural force than alone. Their idea was as
bold as it was simple: to create a national organization that would provide
services to support the endeavors of its members and advocate for the field as
a whole. </p>
<p>Today, we work with member organizations and allies to ensure
a free and open Internet for creators, develop leaders in the public interest
media and the visual arts communities, and biennially bring people together at
our signature national conference.  We
also do advocacy work in Washington on behalf of the independent creative
sector, and create and publish original research like Mapping the Media Arts
Field.</p>
