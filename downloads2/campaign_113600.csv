Woven with intentionally imprecise methods for creating nutritious, resourceful and fueling dishes for the active person, <i>The NonRecipe book</i> offers a new framework for approaching the kitchen, and our world - starting with our mind. These parallels found between the lessons I've learned in the kitchen - drawing from experiences across creating and working in food companies, coaching, consulting, startups, corporate - in athletic feats, and entrepreneurial endeavors offers a broad and unique perspective to approaching our plates. <i>The NonRecipe Book</i> is full of practical tools and the professional knowledge that connects these mindsets fostered in the kitchen, to stepping up in life.<br/><br/>My name is Amanda Presgraves and I am the author of <i>The NonRecipe Book</i>. What originated our of requests from friends begging me to document my strange food combinations into a recipe book, I quickly realized, I was the last person to write a recipe book. As I’ve never followed a recipe in the kitchen - it dawned on me - I haven’t in life either. What started as a way to give people my recipes, soon turned into the anti-thesis - taking the reader through a one-of-a-kind process to figure it out for themselves.<br/><br/>While conducing <i>The NonRecipe Book</i> Mindset Research interviews, <i>I learned many people believe</i>:<br/>1. they can’t cook, especially without directions<br/>2. that eating and living healthfully is boring, exhausting, confusing, time consuming and expensive<br/>3. the only way to adhering to desired food behaviors is through strict willpower</p><p>4. there is a certain prescription of eating and living that we need to follow<br/><br/><i>I’m challenging these believes, and proving them wrong.</i><br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the kitchen is a mirror for teaching us about ourselves. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for fueling ourselves from a place of radical self-compassion, caring for the health of our mind, body, and the world, and that we can truly create our own adventure, and life. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you write your own recipes starting in the kitchen, and watching the self-belief unfold into every facet of your life.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about to throw out the recipe book and listen to your voice. You'll hear heart-opening, research-driven, and uniquely-connected stories such as...</p><ul>
<li>The experience growing up as kid with ADHD and how it taught me how to navigate the world on my own terms</li>
<li>An almost career-ending injury that forced me to face the dark aspects of myself, and the difficult reality that I could identify as more than an athlete</li>
<li>Groundbreaking emerging research on the connection between self-compassion and mental toughness; how food impacts our mood; and ways to drive behavior change</li>
<li>Stories of food access, systemic injustice in our food system, sustainability, nutrition and resourceful eating from my professional and personal life</li>
<li>The process of learning to listen to our body, trust our intuition and reconnect with our body even when it feels like it is betraying us</li>
<li>Overcoming cultures of burnout and hustle in competitive athletics and entrepreneurship</li>
<li>The courageous and empowering journey of NonRecipe-students who evolved from cooking with fear and a lack of belief in the kitchen, to ultimately realizing their potential to fuel themselves and their life</li>
<li>How the process of building a business is surprisingly similar to creating a meal</li>
<li>My experiences with body image and how seeing eating disorders in the athletic community influenced my approach to food</li>
<li>Connecting the NonRecipe approach to the principles and interviews from the the worlds top designers, business leaders, and innovative companies with human behavior, neuroscience, and sports psychology</li>
</ul><p><i>You will love this book if you:</i></p><ul>
<li>Are the athlete and on-the-go human seeking nutritionally and scientifically backed ways of fueling your journey, forging your own path, and taking the trail less traveled.</li>
<li>Are ready to change your habits and behavior with a refreshed, intuitive and compassionate way of approaching food that is simple, fun, approachable, realistic and EASY - so you can put that energy back into living and leading a novel life of adventure</li>
<li>Don’t believe yourself to be a cook and think eating optimally means boring, tasteless food - you will see it doesn’t mean sacrificing delicious tastes, a fun lifestyle or the special experiences around food. It only enhances it. Your food can look great, taste better, and be phenomenal for you</li>
<li>Are a young athlete, high school graduate, retired Olympian, or mom of 3 kiddo’s, realizing you need to care for your mind as much as they body - that is were we begin</li>
<li>Feel the weight of society’s perfection-focused pressure in how you eat, move and live (we redefine that)</li>
</ul><p><strong>What struck me the most in my research:</strong> the mindsets one took into the kitchen, was identical to their approach in life.

<h3>Hi! I'm Reidun. I'm writing a book. </h3>
<p><i>(the first of many)</i><br/><br/>Memoir and biography have always fascinated me. There's something humanizing in sharing our truths with others as we experienced them. It's a way of connecting with others and finding common ground in all of our unique life experiences. </p>
<p>I've been writing for over ten years and never settled exactly on what to publish first as my debut title. As I expanded my repertoire, I discovered I had a talent for breathing life into nonfiction. Getting to the meat of a concept or event and deciphering it for others to enjoy and learn from is my passion, and I do it with words. I love teaching, sharing, and giving advice--and taking it, too!</p>
<p>Sharing our stories and passing them down to others is a critical element of developing culture and growing ideas. Each of our stories is important. Nordisco fills a space that right now is a little lacking. Alcoholism and its effect on families isn't a new topic, but some of what happens and the experiences I share are unique through the LGBTQ+ and mental health lenses.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>What I need: writing fuel! And that comes in two forms: coffee and money. I've got the coffee. (like I'd ever let myself run out)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Here's the breakdown of my budget. </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540528372/hjyfreg2ng1dcadf1bxc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><strong>BLUE</strong> data represents a best-case scenario if I could scrounge up every cent I needed to get this off the ground on a 30,000-word manuscript. That is just over $5800. This includes a full team and extra room for revisions (and perfection!)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><strong>YELLOW</strong> data represents an optimized/adjusted budget, with a revised manuscript of 25,000 words. This settles around $4600. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><strong>RED</strong> data also represents a 25,000-word manuscript where I skimp on some services and make do with what I've got. This is not ideal, but I can make things work. That's still around $3500.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why the campaign goal is only $2,000</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I want NORDISCO to be <i>accessible to as many people as possible. </i>There is value in the story I'm sharing, and I do not want it to be prohibitive based on cost.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Every single backing level is a simple quantity preorder, with one or two perks thrown in for good measure. (And maybe some surprises! You never know! ;)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The majority of the funding is to prepare the manuscript. Printing is the final step before marketing. For example, if 720 backers preorder the eBook and fund the entire project, then I know where to work the budget and can focus more on content, format, and marketing over design and printing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>At the end of the day, just like many of you, I also work a day job to support myself and fund as much of this project as possible. The reality is that I can only do so much of that on my own.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Your Preorder Does</h3>
<ul>

</div></div>","Hi! I'm Reidun. I'm writing a book. 
(the first of many)Memoir and biography have always fascinated me. There's something humanizing in sharing our truths with others as we experienced them. It's a way of connecting with others and finding common ground in all of our unique life experiences. 
I've been writing for over ten years and never settled exactly on what to publish first as my debut title. As I expanded my repertoire, I discovered I had a talent for breathing life into nonfiction. Getting to the meat of a concept or event and deciphering it for others to enjoy and learn from is my passion, and I do it with words. I love teaching, sharing, and giving advice--and taking it, too!
Sharing our stories and passing them down to others is a critical element of developing culture and growing ideas. Each of our stories is important. Nordisco fills a space that right now is a little lacking. Alcoholism and its effect on families isn't a new topic, but some of what happens and the experiences I share are unique through the LGBTQ+ and mental health lenses.

What I Need
What I need: writing fuel! And that comes in two forms: coffee and money. I've got the coffee. (like I'd ever let myself run out)
Here's the breakdown of my budget. 

BLUE data represents a best-case scenario if I could scrounge up every cent I needed to get this off the ground on a 30,000-word manuscript. That is just over $5800. This includes a full team and extra room for revisions (and perfection!)
YELLOW data represents an optimized/adjusted budget, with a revised manuscript of 25,000 words. This settles around $4600. 
RED data also represents a 25,000-word manuscript where I skimp on some services and make do with what I've got. This is not ideal, but I can make things work. That's still around $3500.
 
 
 
Why the campaign goal is only $2,000
I want NORDISCO to be accessible to as many people as possible. There is value in the story I'm sharing, and I do not want it to be prohibitive based on cost.
Every single backing level is a simple quantity preorder, with one or two perks thrown in for good measure. (And maybe some surprises! You never know! ;)
The majority of the funding is to prepare the manuscript. Printing is the final step before marketing. For example, if 720 backers preorder the eBook and fund the entire project, then I know where to work the budget and can focus more on content, format, and marketing over design and printing.
At the end of the day, just like many of you, I also work a day job to support myself and fund as much of this project as possible. The reality is that I can only do so much of that on my own.
 
 

What Your Preorder Does

Guarantees a digital or physical copy of the book for you.
When possible, supports organizations such as RAINN (coming soon, once budget is finalized!)
Sends the message to your community that you support independent art and creative control.

Mostly,- we pay for websites and we do all our own admin, $1000 yearly, not including email providers and stitches,- retreat infrastructure often requires handsome up front fees, occasional travel, huge amounts of logistics, and we reckon $4000-5000 before we begin to collect,- we enjoy being able to offer hugely discounted (or even free) retreats for the needy but capital-free,- in the meanwhile, there is the question of food and shelter, minimal as we all are,- everything we do is inspired by transforminginto tangible acts of hope and peaceful social activism.                       into tangible acts of hope and peaceful social activism.Risk-Free PERKSWe don't see any risk involved in our perks because the cheapest gives one a sense of having contributed to a proven good cause, and from those two up, tangible items, or many of them,     Or, in the words of readers so far -""I'm on page 123 started two days ago shit I can't stop and I'm not a reader!""""I started and finished it in one day...it is one of the most honest autobiographies I have ever read. Poetic. Brutally honest. Painful and incredibly naked and just so in time.""""I read it cover to cover that afternoon and just loved it!  The first thing I thought was, how incredibly brave of him to share his story. It really hit home for me, the book made me laugh, cry, think and feel!""​""A total game changer.""""An amazing, heartfelt, mind shattering epic adventure.""""Do yourself and possibly the world a favor and read this book. I promise you will not put it down.""""The most heartfelt and poetically written and truthful piece of literature I may have ever had the good fortune of reading and not been able to put down.""""Read it cover to cover today and you have nailed it!"" ""Really beautifully written.""“Just want to reiterate how truly amazing I found Butterfly Man! Your book is the ultimate emotional roller coaster ride – searingly honest, harrowing, almost cataclysmic, deeply touching, inspirational and uplifting, and in the final analysis life affirming and an absolutely irresistible catalyst for change!”​""I had no idea what I was in for. I read it cover to cover in one afternoon and just loved it! The first thing I thought was, how incredibly brave for him to share his story. It really hit home for me. The book made me laugh, cry, think, but mostly feel! After reading it you'll think about yourself, your truth, your connection to this world and to others and feel the changes and creativity it encourages.""""Butterfly Man is a raw, honest, and highly entertaining story of a man breaking free from the chains of shame and letting go and trying to live up to the super man sign hanging over his head after years of over achieving and not listening to what his body was trying to tell him. It is an inspiration in discovering yourself as a human being.""​""WOW. It's like poetry. I'm feeling all the angst and shame as I'm reading it. Some parts feel chaotic and stressful, just how I imagine you must've been feeling. I'm loving it!""""This is a beast my man!""""Honestly I think I could read it a million times and still not be able to find the words.""""This book is a mess!! Just like many of us!!!""""It's painful in every way and if the person reading it isn't able to feel the agony you were in they've reached inside to feel their own.""“A must read for anyone who wants to be a true to themselves and still perform! I both cried and laughed, a beautiful read.”""The style is fresh and original I hear the voice clearly...it's going along with the ride!""""Real and passionate and I was alongside you the whole way. It's almost like a huge verse of poetry.""“This is amazingly real you can feel the suffering! Fuck bru!""""It's really beautifully written and done so in such a unique way. It feels like a stream of consciousness.""""You did a lot of amazing things with your words and I was sad when it was over. It felt so nice, getting lost in your craziness and so refreshing and grounding.""""You found a way, a portal, a path to us people and I promise to be one of the messengers. Your book will not sit on a shelf, it will travel around and get all tattered and worn out, that is a promise!!""**By no means is this a complete list of reviews, but our admin time is limited**PERKs, CONTINUEDThe most expensive of our perks gives you or someone you love an epic week in either Spain or Thailand,, with a top-ranked and amazing retreat provider, Olive Retreat,, where John's journey began and continues. Please enquire also for the possibility of bringing a retreat to you or your organization.           Check here to read what guests have said about Olive!PERKs, CONTINUEDAnd yet another perk is an actual appearance of Bodhi John McInroy himself, worth almost every penny, kind of.    Check that oke out. Hectic, bru! (ten bucks says he isn't wearing shoes)Rather than ""impact"" we prefer ""effects""The beauty of our lives is that we didn't set out from the beginning to be doing this, and yet, we are so grateful it has fallen to us to be here on the page together now, regardless of the outcome.Promoting an amazing and compassionate work of literature with a humanitarian objective, and doing retreats and supporting creativity and helping people to heal from various illnesses (mental and physical) and become healthier and happier and more loving and compassionate toward themselves and other living creatures is a pretty cool karmentum to have, eh?EffectsWhat you can say, if nothing else, when you look into the mirror or your lover's eyes or your children's or the sky is that out there yet another handful of people have invested their lives into saving other living creatures from suffering and abuse and certain doom. and have created a work of literary art, a health course and an online resource for supporting peaceful social activists,                  Look, it's Karma,                    we believe our project is valuable because mental and physical illness is increasing globally,
it has to do with how we are expected to live our lives,
that 150 billion animals are slaughtered every year,
that's 400 million a day, for food,
that half the world's population live on less than $2.50 a day,
that 5 (white) own half this world's wealth,
women still earn half as much as men,
25% of those earning women are sexually harassed,
75% of those who report it are punished,
age, disability, race, color, religion, nationality, are continued criteria for discrimination,
16,000 children under 5 years of age die every day,
21 million people are trapped in one kind of slavery or another,
more than 100 million people are homeless,
climate change is real,
each year, nations generate 1.3 billion tons of waste,
8 million tons of plastic go into the oceans every year, for a total of more than 5.25 trillion pieces as of now,
we eat them,
48 football fields of forest are cut down every minute,
sugar is the most dangerous and addictive drug in the world,
diabetes, heart disease, obesity, certain kinds of cancer, are the result,
180,000 annual deaths from fizzy drinks alone,
do you get our point?
do you understand why the world is suffering?
can you imagine that we've been trying to do something about this suffering for years but would like to do it on a larger scale?
we used to live for income, and now we live for reviews, i.e., there are those mornings, often actually, when you ask yourself, ""why I am I doing this?"" And then the message comes,
and you grab your mobile, open it, and read,""I am so lucky to have found you at the time of my greatest need.""​""I can't tell you how grateful I am for what you have given me, and how my life has changed as a result.""""Thank you for helping me remember to enjoy the journey as much as I feel the pain of awareness and a feeling of injustice for so many people.​""""I'm pretty sure you saved my life.""""I have been writing for days and I can't stop!""Other Ways You Can Maybe you don't have the dough to spare. That's cool. We really need help with social media, some editing, some admin, some of this and that. You see who we are and what we do, what looks fun for you?And that's all there is to it.And yet, we are happy to share our success. Maybe you want to invest your time in helping us develop our initiatives, and we are happy to share our resources and good luck with you, too, because that's just the way we are.Peace from those who for so long didn't feel at all, but now, do.""God bless, us, everyone."" - Charles John Huffam Dickens.",11.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hello my name is Matt Wright. I am a 29 year old man from Prince Georges county Maryland. I am a first time author, but I like to think that I am an experienced storyteller. I practically grew up in a hair salon/barber shop where both my parents worked. As a kid I spent more time at ""The Shop"" than I did in my actual home. Two things that I remembered as a kid was to stay out of grown folks business, but I also learned that everyone had a story. As a kid I wasn't privy to join the conversation but I was always allowed to listen and over time I gained perspective and learned the art of storytelling. </p>
<p>RNPGLA is bigger than me! This book is for every person who has ever scrolled down their social media timeline and thought less of themselves, for people who have had dreams deferred, or for people who may feel stagnant in a 9-5p and are looking for ways to grow.  Your contribution to this campaign will not just help me finish this project, but also help others out there who may be needing some encouragement or an escape in form of a book!</p>
<p>This project is extremely important to me because there aren't enough voices in our community highlighting the idea that it's ok to be normal. Social media has made it extremely easy to lose perspective in 2018, and this has led to my own personal experiences where I noticed direct correlation between  the ""problems"" I went through in my life and my ""skewed"" perspective""  </p>
</div><div>
<p>I am looking to raise $7500 in order to start my initial wave of mass production for this book, The $7500 will go towards editing fees, publishing costs, promotion expenses, and any unknown expenses that a first time author may experience. Editing and the production of the book will be the primary focus in the event that we do not reach the goal of $7500. </p>

<h3>Was Marley &amp; Scrooge the only ghost-to-human intervention ever?</h3>
<p>This is what I wonder.</p>
<p>Marley’s haunting, and the arrangement he made for Scrooge had a far-reaching and beneficial effect.  Surely, poor Jacob Marley’s ghost found some peace for being such a compassionate medium. I like to believe so.  I would also like to believe that attempts at intercessions such as this occur with some frequency among unfulfilled spirits. Even now. Even in Los Angeles. I Believe.</p>

UPDATE #1:
Read the opening of ""I Believe"" on my blog - http://writerblogue.blogspot.com/
 
Was Marley & Scrooge the only ghost-to-human intervention ever?
This is what I wonder.
Marley’s haunting, and the arrangement he made for Scrooge had a far-reaching and beneficial effect.  Surely, poor Jacob Marley’s ghost found some peace for being such a compassionate medium. I like to believe so.  I would also like to believe that attempts at intercessions such as this occur with some frequency among unfulfilled spirits. Even now. Even in Los Angeles. I Believe.
 This is that story.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><em>Our elders hold unique stories: both from the historical perspective and from the perspective of love - they are the ones who love us selflessly, wholeheartedly no matter what we do</em> </p>
<p>(a note from a friend)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let us introduce ourselves and our grandma (<em>babushka</em> as we call her in Russian).</p>
<p><strong>Maria (Masha)</strong> is my cousin, she is a graphic designer <em>illuminating the stories</em>. Have a look at her work here: <a href=""http://www.mariaklochkova.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mariaklochkova.com/</a> Masha got her MA degree at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and currently lives in London. </p>
<p><strong>Ekaterina (Katya)</strong> who is writing this text is an aspiring writer, an author of a few articles and a recently published family comedy (family members laughed to tears when reading:) I live in Moscow where I am taking a course on Russian literature and find inspiration for my stories.</p>
<p>When I recently got back to Russia after three years of living abroad I went to visit <strong>my grandmother</strong> (her name is Katya, and as you notice I was named after her) and found myself listening to my grandmother's life &amp; family stories. In fact I have heard them for at least ten times already...</p>
<p>And it suddenly stroke me. All this time I've been a passive listener of her stories. Just sitting there, again and again, nodding my head. That's fine, yet - <strong>why don't I write them up and share so that next generations hear them too and be encouraged by babushka's life?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What if our babushka shares about her life in the village in the USSR? The hunger that she went through in 1930s, when all people could eat were fried sunflower seeds? The letters she wrote for many mothers and sisters who asked her write to their husbands (grandma says she used to compose them well:) The time after the war when she and her husband Pavel worked on construction sire to rebuild the entire town?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since then, I've had a strong calling that I can't let those stories go and need to make them live long. With this, Masha and I started to explore the idea of publishing grandma's stories.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every grandmother holds enriching life stories, and our babushka is not unique in this regard. However I didn't notice that we often turn to the stories of the past and connect to our lineage. </p>
<p>This book's immediate impact would be visible in my family. <strong>It will wonderfully unite them around their roots</strong> and help each of my family members find strength for their own life journeys. </p>
<p>Secondly, I believe this book would become an <strong>inspiration for many young people to visit their elders and listen to them</strong>, and - by listening - to themselves become more whole and grounded individuals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Then, most importantly what if we take those stories beyond our family? What could the world learn about life in USSR during babushka's youth years? </em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Last but not the least, our babushka would be very happy to see this book as a <strong>gift for her 79th birthday </strong>:)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br class=""Apple-interchange-newline""/>We believe that crowdsourcing the funds would add us confidence in the importance of this work for the world. Of course, we would write up and share all the stories regardless of the funding, but publishing a book is different. </p>
<p>If we don't get the money through this campaign, the stories are likely to stay in our laptops and get emailed to our children in the future. It's fine, but not quite enough for the kind of stories our babushka holds.</p>
<p>If we exceed the goal, we will print additional copies and give them out to our funders.</p>

<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">I'm Rodvé Lewis and I graduated from San Jose State University in 2011 with a degree in Business Administration-Finance, and a minor in Economics. My passion is writing and telling stories. I've been creatively writing since I was 10. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">I finally wrote my first book titled ""Dreams or Degrees: How to Graduate from College in Four Years"" after many years of contemplation. At first I had no idea where to start, but I just knew that this book would definitely help students and I just started outlining. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">My story is unique because I was behind in school, but I was able to make an underdog turnaround to get back on track and out with a cap. Now I feel compelled to share my story with students around the world.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">My goal is $3000 to cover mainly publishing expenses. Publishing is roughly $2000, the other $1000 will be used to get a short run of books printed so I can start selling them. The more money I have toward printing, the cheaper it'll be to print. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>It Just Got Real</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The fact of the matter is that most schools graduate less than 50% of their students in 4 years. It's actually more like less than 30%. For example, when I graduated from San Jose State University, only 6.8% of the students did it in 4 years, while only 2.3% of the black males graduated in 4 years. It's not normal anymore to graduate in 4 years, so I'm giving you all the keys to success. I didn't write this book to try to make a lot of money. I wrote the book because I felt like what I did was special and if a lot of people agree with me I will be able to continue to write books.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Now don't get me wrong, some books are fun, but most ""how-to"" books are boring. Well this isn't your typical ""how-to"" book. I wrote it from my perspective and it reads more like a short story. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">I understand that everyone isn't in the position to contribute cash, but you can still help. There are millions of students in the world that may need this book: transfer students, high school seniors, regular college students, etc. They might not see my video, but with your help by sharing this, more people may be interested in the book and will have the option to contribute to the campaign. </span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong>The Book</strong></p>

I'm Rodvé Lewis and I graduated from San Jose State University in 2011 with a degree in Business Administration-Finance, and a minor in Economics. My passion is writing and telling stories. I've been creatively writing since I was 10. 
I finally wrote my first book titled ""Dreams or Degrees: How to Graduate from College in Four Years"" after many years of contemplation. At first I had no idea where to start, but I just knew that this book would definitely help students and I just started outlining. 
My story is unique because I was behind in school, but I was able to make an underdog turnaround to get back on track and out with a cap. Now I feel compelled to share my story with students around the world.
What I Need & What You Get
My goal is $3000 to cover mainly publishing expenses. Publishing is roughly $2000, the other $1000 will be used to get a short run of books printed so I can start selling them. The more money I have toward printing, the cheaper it'll be to print. 
It Just Got Real
The fact of the matter is that most schools graduate less than 50% of their students in 4 years. It's actually more like less than 30%. For example, when I graduated from San Jose State University, only 6.8% of the students did it in 4 years, while only 2.3% of the black males graduated in 4 years. It's not normal anymore to graduate in 4 years, so I'm giving you all the keys to success. I didn't write this book to try to make a lot of money. I wrote the book because I felt like what I did was special and if a lot of people agree with me I will be able to continue to write books.
Now don't get me wrong, some books are fun, but most ""how-to"" books are boring. Well this isn't your typical ""how-to"" book. I wrote it from my perspective and it reads more like a short story. 
Other Ways You Can Help
I understand that everyone isn't in the position to contribute cash, but you can still help. There are millions of students in the world that may need this book: transfer students, high school seniors, regular college students, etc. They might not see my video, but with your help by sharing this, more people may be interested in the book and will have the option to contribute to the campaign. 
The Book
Each chapter is self illustrated to give you an idea of how I think. The book will range from 100-150 pages in length when it's finally printed. I kept the typical college student's workload in mind and did my best not to write a text book.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What is Writers Read?</span></h3>
<p>Writers Read was born in Sitka, Alaska on September 26, 2012.  It began because one local writer realized there was no space in the Sitka community for writers to share their writing live for an appreciative audience.  She believed the small, island community was full of writers quietly working away at their craft, feeling alone with their art.  It turned out she was right!  Writers began to emerge from boats, cabins, homes, kayaks, tents, offices, the mountains, and the muskegs when she reached out asking for writers willing to read their own writing in front of an audience.  The first ever Writers Read was made of six writers who performed for an audience of over 75!  Since then Writers Read has happened once a month (with a month or two off) featuring at least four new writers at each event.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why Does Writers Read Need Money?</h3>
<p>Writers Read now wants to share local writers' work not just in live format, but in print, too.  To do this The Island Institute has offered to team with Writers Read to showcase Sitkan writers in the summer issue of ""Connotations.""  This special issue of ""Connotations"" will include writers who have performed in Writers Read, in addition to some Sitkan writers who have <em>yet</em> to perform live!</p>
<p>It takes a bit of money to print ""Connotations,"" and while Writers Read has raised some of the cost already through generous donations from audience members at events, we still need a bit more in order to get this very special issue printed and in your hands.  ALL money goes to printing costs (no staff are paid for this project).</p>
<h3>Some Perks to Donating</h3>
<ul>
<li>Donate $10 and receive a heartfelt ""thank you"" email from Writers Read and The Island Institute staff.</li>
<li>Donate $25 and get your name listed in the upcoming issue of ""Connotations"" as a financial conributor to the issue.</li>
<li>Donate $50 and receive a free copy of this special Writers Read issue of ""Connotations.""</li>
<li>Donate $100 and receive a free copy of this special Writers Read issue of ""Connotations"" as well as a public ""thank you"" at the special Writers Read event in September when we will make the summer ""Connotations"" issue available for purchase.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Some Other Perks to Donating</h3>
<ul>
<li>Help encourage Sitka writers to keep working away at their craft and consider sharing their writing publicly.</li>
<li>Help Writers Read become a sustainable part of Sitka's vibrant arts community.</li>
<li>Support The Island Institute's new focus on local writers and artists, and encourage The Island Institute to continue to showcase locals once a year in ""Connotations.""</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe you can't actually donate money right now, and that's A-OK because you can still help!  Get the word out about this fundraising campaign by sharing this indiegogo link with your friends.  Also, buy a ""Connotations"" issue when you see one available.  And attend future Writers Reads; the next one will be in September and an appreciative audience is just as important as the writers willing to share their writing.  Thank you!</p>

<p>I published my second book, I Know Very Well How I Got My Name, on May 1st 2013. I am touring this summer to give readings- so far I have visited San Francisco and NYC. I want to go to Philadelphia next to attend the Trans Health Conference- I've never been! </p>
<h3><strong>My Goal</strong></h3>
<p>I hope to have a table at the Philly Trans Health Conference (June 13-15) where I will sell &amp; sign books as well as answer questions and hopefully have some great talks with lovely people (yourself included)! I am also giving a free reading with other trans writers on the evening of June 13th.

<p>The conference itself is free, but paying for a room for 3 days, travel, buying the books to sell, renting a table, and compensating an assistant for the 3 days really adds up. </p>
<p>I really want to meet readers who are attending! This would also be a HUGE opportunity for me, seeing as thousands of trans and queer people attend each year. I could potentially acquire hundreds of new readers for my books. Because I am a self-published author, reaching out to readers in situations like this means everything! I need to get the word out there about my new book.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that books and readings are currently my only source of income, as I was fired from my job earlier this year for very sketchy reasons :(</p>
<p>My new book would not have been possible without your support in 2012 (see kickstarter: <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/57367316/new-book-from-author-of-refuse-about-transgender-y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/57367316/new-book-from-author-of-refuse-about-transgender-y</a>) and now I need some help again to make sure it is a success. </p>

<h3>I have been granted a full scholarship to attend the Writing &amp; Knowing Workshop, led by Ellen Bass, Dorianne Laux and Joseph Millar at The Esalen Institute In Big Sur, California. Now all I need are expenses for travel, accomodations and meals. This would be a tremendous opportunity for me. As most of you know, I have been seriously pursuing my craft as a poet for over 35 years (I started at 18) and received my MFA in Poetry from Vermont College in January of 2005. My first collection of poetry: <em>Closer</em>,  was published in June 2011. I am widely published, and details of my career as a poet are available through my website at WIX and Facebook page. A great deal (though not all) of my verse addresses the struggles of gay men in American culture, which is a cause of key importance to me. Ellen Bass (my friend and mentor) believes this 5 day workshop will be of particular value to me, and my growth as a poet. Ellen was the poet who chose me as one of the 10 selected for The Lambda Literary : Emerging Writers Retreat in August 2010. I am also wait-listed for Yaddo, and apply for residencies regularly, so all funds raised will be put to good use. Any donation, $1.00 or more, would be deeply appreciated. </h3>

Praise for HalineHaline is a mesmerizing story of a fallen world in which the characters struggle to cope with life after an environmental cataclysm. Not only is Sundeep's story told with a brisk pace and enveloping detail, it's also a call to act - to shape the future, before it shapes us. – Kabir Sehgal, AuthorIncredibly engaging and a total page turner. I found myself still reading at 1am, and didn't stop. I haven't been that engaged by a book since Harry Potter or Twilight! – Lauren Weinstein (pictured)I finished Haline in less than 24 hours - it was one of the most original and enjoyable books I've read this year. And when I say that, keep in mind that I'm only an occasional sci-fi fan, so I was initially skeptical about whether I'd enjoy it. If you like the sci-fi genre even a little bit, get this book. – Tyler Willis, EntrepreneurFor fans of ""The Wind-Up Girl"" and ""The Handmaid's Tale"" a cautionary story of a not too distant dystopian future, it serves as a hard slap across the face to wake from our collective apathy. – @thesubjectiveHaline is a fantastic cautionary tale which embodies a simple but powerful idea: the sum of our individual choices can greatly affect our collective reality. I dare you to read it and not feel the urge to make a change. – Satyender Mahajan, EntrepreneurHiMy name is Sundeep Ahuja. I’m an entrepreneur (and former actor) who 19 months ago started the long journey of writing a novel. I’m incredibly excited to pre-launch the book on indiegogo...thanks for stopping by!What's Haline?Haline is a dystopian novel about a “post climate-change” future. The plot is suspenseful and fast paced (it takes place over just 4 days), and early readers tell me they weren’t able to put the book down. It’s just over 50k words, or about 210 pages at a 5x8 trim.Like any great book (a-hem :), Haline is really about its main characters and their personal journeys: Natasha, who has something to prove; Aaren, who has something to hide; and Joaquin, who discovers something about himself that changes the course of his life – and all their lives.The story revolves around an upcoming election in the city-state of Haline, where the charismatic President Gaven Jemmer is seeking an unprecedented third term in a resource-starved world licking its wounds after decades of war and famine following the shutdown of earth's thermohaline flow.Why I wrote HalineI care about our planet. And its people. But I’ve been worried that we people haven’t been taking good enough care of our planet (or each other, for that matter). Two years ago I started writing a non-fiction “update” to An Inconvenient Truth in hopes of raising awareness around climate change and corporate greed (news flash: they are related). Then one day it hit me: I should write a fiction novel about climate change and corporate greed...it’d be much more fun to read!PRE-ORDER TODAY!I'm pre-selling 500 special edition, numbered & autographed copies to fund:
~$1000 to hire a professional editor. 

~$500 to launch a basic website.


~$250 to hire a cover artist. After all, most people judge books by their covers (the image above is my amateur attempt...don't judge! :).

~$250 to format the book for publication.
...and of course, money to fulfill the perks and market the book.
The novel is among the first of its kind in raising awareness around a possible “post climate-change future.” Pre-order the book to enjoy a good read and do a good deed :). FAQWhat does ""free download (select days)"" mean?I intend to publish via Amazon's Kindle Select program, which allows me to give the ebook away via Amazon (no Kindle required) for ""free"" for a couple days. I'll email you several days in advance of the free days, and then again on the days themselves.When can I expect to receive my perks?My intention is to order paperbacks of the final draft by 11/30, and then ship USPS out of San Francisco by 12/13. How do I win a free perk by sharing on Facebook or Twitter?I'll be watching Facebook & Twitter for people sharing this campaign with #haline; when it ends, I'll give away 10 'paperback,' 1 'stocking stuffer' and 1 'blissmo' perk.What is the book ""rated""?Much like Hunger Games, the book is somewhere between PG and PG13 – making it the perfect holiday gift for almost everyone.

My name is John Mierau. ENEMY LINES is a near-future adventure novel. It's built on mystery, danger, a touch of humor, and exciting characters you will root for... but they won't always win.

Now I want to make it available in ebook and Print. I created this IndieGoGo campaign to fund editing & cover illustration. 

UPDATE: [Dec. 28,2011]

What's ENEMY LINES about? Well now, that would be telling! In short, it's a near-future adventure about conspiracies, spies and aliens-where the lines aren't as clear as you think.  I don't want to spoil it by saying more, but if you like hints, you can check out the Book Trailer, or the transmedia campaign I put together with some of the top audiobook and podcast fiction voice around: 'ENEMY LINES: Transmissions'.

<p>I finally got the courage to live a dream. To travel and see as much as the world as I can with my 17 year old daughter. Although I am terrifed! I am not letting my fear stop me. I sold everything, packed and left my house, my haven, my security, my family, friends, my cat and dog. </p>
<p>Now we are in Europe. We stared the 4th of July, independance day. We have been traveling for almost a month now, started in Berlin, Amsterdam and now we are in France. From here we hope to continue to Spain, Italy, Turkey and as far as we can get.</p>
<p>I want to travel with Zelina for 6 months. I feel this is the best education and gift that I can give her and myself. And inspire other to follow their dreams.</p>
<p>She is the reason I want to be a better person. I’m teaching her things I am now learning at 40. Learning together has made us both strong and good friends. I have to be an example of everything I believe. It's a priveldge to be her Mother.</p>
<p>We want to travel and meet people, and film and blog our journey. So far we have been couchsurfing most of our trip, which is a great experience. We have met great people and have been able to experience how people live in each country. Yes these are strangers that host us in their homes. I have hosted over 55 people in Mexico that were traveling. Please take a look at the site <a href=""http://www.couchsurfing.org/profile.html?id=3XYL335"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.couchsurfing.org/profile.html?id=3XY...</a></p>
<p>I’m not worried about the destination as much as the intention and purpose. I love small towns and cities. There is still so much good and beauty in our world we don't see. I hope to share with you that beauty.</p>
<p>On my return I will be starting a travel clothing line, with comfortable fabric, with hidden pockets for money and passport. Clothing to wear while traveling that are functional, trending and practical.</p>
<h3><strong>Who is Super Chicken?</strong></h3>
<p>We are all full of fears, we are all chickens. I used to think that feeling fear was not a good thing. That if you had confidence the fear went away. Although that is not the case, the fear is still there.</p>
<div>Fear is a very uncomfortable feeling. EVERYONE feels fear, doing something out of our comfort zone. Fear with action is courage. The trick is not letting that fear paralyze you in life, feel the fear and do it anyway.</div>
<div>
<div>I design clothes, so I designed myself a chicken suit, a <strong>Super Chicken</strong> suit! What is a <strong>Super Chicken</strong> anyone that is scared or chicken, but is conquering that fear.</div>
<div>I am dragging this suit with me every where I go.  We are taking pictures to remind others that they can live their dreams. I'm still a chicken! </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Laugh and Smile!</h3>
</div>
When people see me in my chicken suit they laugh or/and smile.</div>
<div>There is a energy that shifts when you laugh and when you smile. You relax, and open up, it's a universal language.</div>
<div>There is a connection you make with others when you share a smile or a giggle.
<div>This is a great way to have fun and getting my point across. All my life I have been concerned about my looks or about how I appeared.</div>
</div>
<div>There is a rigidness and shyness that I have developed. </div>
<div>Well I think this is going to help me get out of my own skin. It's a freedom that I have not allowed myself, to be ridiculous and silly. I am still afraid to be ridiculous. I feel <em>very</em> ridiclous every time I get in this chicken suit, but I do it anyway.</div>
<div>My biggest desire is to inspire others to <em>Live their dreams</em>!, as I follow my own. Something I have always been too chicken to do, as so many are</div>
<p>I am grateful for everything in my life. I know I can’t do this alone. We need the support and help of others.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I have funded everything myself so far, I have used almost all my savings. We have spent $2,000 usd in one month in food and transportation and a bit of site seeing. This is on a tight budget in Europe I'm getting .77 cent for my us dollar. When we get back, we also have to set up a home again. We have no other income coming in.</p>
<p>We would love to travel another 6 months, but we need $12,000. If we do not get this we will only have enough for 2 more months, and then we will have to go back.</p>
<p>Since my house is packed and we have no home at the moment we would like to do all the traveling we can. Before we settle down again.</p>
<p>The money will give us flexiablity to meet more people and interview and film them. To do things and not to be on such a shoe string. We can take more time to work online writing and editing pictures to share with you. We would love to volunteer some place for a few weeks as well.</p>
<p>I am in the middle of writing a book on fear and facing it, and our journey.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If we can do this, <strong>anyone can</strong>. Everything is a sacrifice, we have given up a lot to do this. We can learn so much from each other. It's not always easy and it's often not comfortable. But when you get out of the box. you can see the circle we are in.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>My name is Thea Monyee´. I am a poet, a therapist, and a mother.  Most of you know me through Def Poetry, Verses and Flow, Da Poetry Lounge, or maybe I performed at your college.  But this is not about how we met; this is about where we are going.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Murmurs of a MadWoman </em>is a collection of work inspired by several life-changing moments that occurred in my life between the years 2009 and 2011.  This collection asks the question, what happens after I break?  Imagine that an emotional bomb goes off in your life.  What happens next?  After the landmines have exploded and the landslides have wiped away everything you thought you knew?  There will be hysteria, pain, and anger. Eventually there will be consciousness and a return of your survival instinct.  There will be sacrifices that have to be made and unsung heroes that appear out of thin air.  And if all goes according to plan, there will be a resurrection.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For those of you who are not familiar with my work this will be a beautiful introduction and I look forward to meeting you.  For those who are familiar with my work, this project was largely motivated by the realization that I owe you something.  I owe you more than just the parts of me that I am comfortable with. I owe you my shadow and my light.  I cannot ask these things of you, be it as a friend, an audience member, a supporter, or a client, if I am not willing to give you the same in return.  So here it is, my heart on a silver platter.  Raw, bloodied, and strong. Thank you for your patience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your donations are more than money to me; they are a financial representation of your blessing to move forward with this project.  My goal is to raise $4000.00, which will cover the cost of self-publishing through an amazing company I have identified, and duplication for the first 500 copies of the book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here are the perks!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <strong>$25 – Signed copy of a poem featured in <em>Murmurs</em> (50)</strong></p>
<p><strong>$50 – Signed copy of poem in <em>Murmurs </em>+ <em>In/Tuition</em> CD (30)</strong></p>

<p>Every year thousands of people come to visit the famous wild Chincoteague ponies that live in the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge on Assateague Island. They are often surprised to find out that the ponies have names and want to know how they can learn them.</p>
<p>In 2014 I developed a smart phone app called <i>Chincoteague Pony Names</i> for identifying ponies by their field markings. Over the years it's come to my attention that not everyone has a smart phone or feels comfortable using apps. I've decided to use the data collected in my app to publish a book for those people and anyone who likes books. It will be a 5 x 8 full-color 290 page hardcover book. The retail price will be $25.</p>
<p>Book publishing is a costly business. I would greatly appreciate your help in funding the publishing and printing startup costs needed to bring this book to market. To show my appreciation I'll be offering prints of photographs I've taken of the ponies. There will be a huge selection of photos to choose from.  Photos are cropped for 8x10 or 12x18/20x30. While many are available in both sizes, not all of them are. Some are only 8x10 and some are only 12x18/20x30. Other perks will include copies of the book, in printed or digital PDF forms.</p>
<p>Photos can be previewed at <a href=""http://ginasfamilystore.com/campaign/campaign_8x10.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://ginasfamilystore.com/campaign/campaign_8...</a> and<br/><a href=""http://ginasfamilystore.com/campaign/campaign_20x30.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://ginasfamilystore.com/campaign/campaign_2...</a></p>

Mouvements. Fragmentations. Éclats urbains. Chansons gaies, chansons tristes. Poings levés, contre-poings. Débordements. Corps brisés. Mains menottés.  Violentes valses et débris du temps, etc., etc. Seuls les témoignages resteront : seuls, ils survivront à l’Histoire. C’est à Tunis, du 24 au 28 mars 2015, que se tiendra la prochaine édition du Forum social mondial (FSM), l’un des plus grands rassemblements citoyens. TUNIS, MARS 2015 est un projet de documentation combinant l'image, le son et l'écrit. Il vise à offrir un(des) témoignage(s) personnel(s) de cet événement et de ses contours. Inspiré par le livre-fleuve Constellations du Collectif Mauvaise troupe, TUNIS, MARS 2015  se veut être une quête de sens et une mise en abyme des luttes populaires contemporaines. « Comment naissent-elles ? », « À quoi servent-elles ? », « Qui en sont les protagonistes ? », « À quoi aspirent-ils/elles ? », « Que craignent-ils/elles ? » sont quelques unes des questions qui seront explorées et qui, espérons-le, trouveront réponses lors de ce Forum. Le projet se terminera avec la publication d’un livre disponible en deux formats (électronique et papier) disponible sur un site web. N'hésitez-pas à vous inscrire sur la liste de diffusion du projet afin de suivre sa progression. À QUOI SERVENT VOS CONTRIBUTIONSLes contributions serviront principalement à couvrir les frais suivants : 
Déplacements (billet d'avion et déplacements à Tunis) : jusqu'à hauteur de 40 % du montant total amassé. 
Impression des exemplaires du livre Tunis, mars 2015  : jusqu'à hauteur de 40 % du montant total amassé.
Promotion du projet (site web et lancement) : jusqu'à hauteur de 20 % du montant total amassé.

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Comprehensive Experience</h3>
<p>This isn't just for fans of the book's first release. If you've never read <i>Pomegranate</i> before, this is the best way to do so: this is <i>Pomegranate</i> as it was always meant to be experienced. </p>
<ul>
<li>The addition of red lettering throughout several of the poems transforms the thematic lens of the work as a whole.</li>

</div></div>","A New Experience
This anniversary rerelease of Pomegranate includes the following brand new features:

Eight full color, full page illustrations by local superstar artist Dani Liddle.
Full color interior and text, allowing themes originally intended in several poems to finally shine through.
Hardcover book with new wraparound dust jacket, featuring new art by Dani Liddle.
A new introduction, ""Pomegranate Revisited,"" by novelist Andrew Kahler.
A brief collection of recently discovered poems, best described as the Pomegranate b-sides, collectively published herein as The Zheng He Sessions. These poems will never be published anywhere else.
An interview with artist Dani Liddle, and a brief gallery of her work. 
Only a limited run of 54 copies will ever be made. Each copy will be hand-numbered and signed by myself and Dani Liddle.

 

The Comprehensive Experience
This isn't just for fans of the book's first release. If you've never read Pomegranate before, this is the best way to do so: this is Pomegranate as it was always meant to be experienced. 

The addition of red lettering throughout several of the poems transforms the thematic lens of the work as a whole.

The Zheng He Sessions are made up of poems that would undoubtedly have been collected in the original release.
Dani Liddle's illustrations elevate the poems beyond what I could have ever imagined possible. The book is worth it for her illustrations alone.

<h2><strong>Campaign Overview</strong></h2>
<p><i>Origins </i>is a collection of stories, thoughts, and feelings about my racial and gender identity. I wrote it because I want others who have faced the same troubles and experiences to feel less alone, and to feel understood. My book will publish in February, 2020.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Origins</i> is about my experiences as an Asian woman in America in the past 8 years that I have lived here. Through short stories, essays, and poems, I share my own, and others', experiences with racial and gender-based prejudice in the United States. Some topics that I write about are different forms of racism, Asian under-representation, gender stereotypes, and sexual misconduct.<br/><br/>My name is Thy Nguyen and I am the author of <i>Origins</i>. I wrote this book because I want others who have faced the same troubles and experiences to feel less alone, and to feel understood. I also want to provide those who cannot relate a better understanding of the challenges that minorities and immigrants face in the U.S, and the tribulations of toxic gender norms and sexual violence.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the different forms of prejudice, and also gain a better understanding of the personal emotions of victims involved. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for race and gender in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you be more empathetic towards victims of discrimination and violence.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about people's personal feelings when they face such struggles. We hear a lot on the news about victims, but how do they actually feel? What are they thinking? Here are some of the stories that you will read about:<ul>
<li>Asian-American underrepresentation in the media and Hollywood; dig deeper into the racial dynamics of some of your favorite movies and shows including <i>Sixteen Candles</i> and <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>.</li>
<li>A news article was published by ESPN, titled “A Chink In The Armor,” in reference to basketball player Jeremy Lin. See the problem with that?</li>
<li>Katy Perry allegedly sexually harassed Josh Kloss, and Kloss actually receiving death threats for speaking out against her. Gender norms and stereotypes are toxic, and victims of sexual misconduct sometimes do not get the appropriate support that they need.</li>
</ul> You will love this book if you are passionate about, or are interested in racial representation and discrimination, and toxicity of gender roles and if you are an advocate against sexual violence.<br/>Origins is a non-fiction book that speaks to marginalized groups, and hopefully anyone, who is looking at issues of race and gender in the United States.<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Origins</h2>The book is written in 3 Parts....<ul>
<li>Part 1 contains the reason I am writing this book and my initial journey as an immigrant to the United States. I was a 12 year old kid living in Vietnam, and my mom suddenly told me that we were going to move to ~America~.</li>
<li>Part 2 contains chapters on racial discrimination — personal stories, secondhand stories, and news. On top of that, I also have fun and confusing experiences I have had as an immigrant to the U.S.</li>
<li>Part 3 contains chapters on gender norms, stereotypes, and sexual misconduct and violence. This chapter examines the effects of gender roles and stereotypes on media, advertising, mental health, and more. There will be several anecdotes from myself, and from friends on gender roles and sexual misconduct.</li>
</ul> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in February 2020</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this coming Spring.</li>
<li>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.</li>
<li>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</li>
<li>A personally signed copy of my book when I publish</li>
<li>A personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</li>
<li>Your Name will appear in a Special Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)</li>
<li>Early access to the Introduction of my Book and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback</li>
<li>The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover</li>
<li>I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my book</li>
<li>And more...</li>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Me quedo contigo</strong> es la crónica de una relación condenada de antemano, inequívocamente avanzando hacia el desastre... aunque la duda es <i>cuál</i> de las relaciones es esta.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Mara trabaja de camarera en un garito madrileño para poder pagarse el conservatorio y su minúscula buhardilla luminosa, donde se evade del mundo tocando la guitarra para Rai. Porque Mara y Rai tienen un pacto. Ella le da lo que Bárbara, su novia, no puede darle, sexo. Y lo que parece una aventura sin compromiso, se vuelve una relación indescifrable que ninguno es capaz de romper. No querían, pero era inevitable; vuelven el uno al otro a pesar de que son conscientes de que su historia de infidelidad tiene fecha de caducidad. Pero mientras tanto, se besan, se acuestan, se divierten, se gritan, se cantan, se enfadan y se buscan. Ella quiere más y él se lo da sin darse cuenta, pero no es capaz de abandonar a Barbi, como él la llama, por la delicada situación que atraviesa. Así que Mara le da celos con el nuevo dj del bar, Ben, un rubiales de muy buen ver con el que consigue progresar en el mundo de la música, que no en la cama.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">¿Y si «la otra» es la buena? ¿Y si «la otra» es la primera? Ellos están haciendo daño a otras personas sabiendo que lo hacen, pero sin poder evitarlo; y al final todo sale y les salpica en plena cara. Deberán ser valientes y afrontar las consecuencias de sus actos, aunque el corazón siempre les acerque. Porque los infieles también tienen su bonita historia de amor, a su manera. ¿Quién se quedará con quién?</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia</strong> es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionales pero de indudable calidad, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para promocionar cada título cuando esta todavía se encuentra en proceso de edición.</p>

<p>Hoy te presentamos a <strong>Isabel Simal</strong>.</p>

</div></div>","¿Qué?
Me quedo contigo es la crónica de una relación condenada de antemano, inequívocamente avanzando hacia el desastre... aunque la duda es cuál de las relaciones es esta.
Mara trabaja de camarera en un garito madrileño para poder pagarse el conservatorio y su minúscula buhardilla luminosa, donde se evade del mundo tocando la guitarra para Rai. Porque Mara y Rai tienen un pacto. Ella le da lo que Bárbara, su novia, no puede darle, sexo. Y lo que parece una aventura sin compromiso, se vuelve una relación indescifrable que ninguno es capaz de romper. No querían, pero era inevitable; vuelven el uno al otro a pesar de que son conscientes de que su historia de infidelidad tiene fecha de caducidad. Pero mientras tanto, se besan, se acuestan, se divierten, se gritan, se cantan, se enfadan y se buscan. Ella quiere más y él se lo da sin darse cuenta, pero no es capaz de abandonar a Barbi, como él la llama, por la delicada situación que atraviesa. Así que Mara le da celos con el nuevo dj del bar, Ben, un rubiales de muy buen ver con el que consigue progresar en el mundo de la música, que no en la cama.
¿Y si «la otra» es la buena? ¿Y si «la otra» es la primera? Ellos están haciendo daño a otras personas sabiendo que lo hacen, pero sin poder evitarlo; y al final todo sale y les salpica en plena cara. Deberán ser valientes y afrontar las consecuencias de sus actos, aunque el corazón siempre les acerque. Porque los infieles también tienen su bonita historia de amor, a su manera. ¿Quién se quedará con quién?
¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionales pero de indudable calidad, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para promocionar cada título cuando esta todavía se encuentra en proceso de edición.
De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy te presentamos a Isabel Simal.
Nacida el 17 de Septiembre de 1985 en Toledo, es Licenciada en Periodismo y Graduada en Turismo por la Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid. Ha sido redactora en la sección deportiva del departamento de radio de la Agencia Efe y, dentro del sector hotelero, ha colaborado en las diversas secciones que lo componen como recepción, administración, reservas y pisos en Madrid, Alicante, Girona, Málaga y Bizkaia. Recientemente, ha trabajado como dependienta en una tienda de moda y, actualmente, dedica su tiempo libre a hacer deporte, leer novelas e intentar escribirlas. Ha recibido numerosos reconocimientos por sus creaciones literarias, destacando el segundo premio en el II Certamen de Relato Breve Navidad Solidaria convocado por la Biblioteca de Castilla La-Mancha con su obra Aquellas circunstancias. Se define como un intento de muchas cosas y mientras trata de descubrir cuál es su aportación al mundo, está ocupada viajando. Sin ir más lejos, ahora mismo está escribiendo estas líneas rodeada de agua cristalina en la isla de Mallorca.
¿Por qué?
Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:
«―Llegas tarde, Rai ―le digo en cuanto abro la puerta.          ―He venido, ¿no?          ―Sí, has venido tarde ―me cruzo de brazos.          ―¿Quieres que me vaya?          ―La pregunta es si querías venir tú.          ―Mira, estoy harto de esta mierda ―se frota la frente―. Vamos a hacerlo y punto.          ―¿Y punto? ¿Punto y seguido? ¿Punto y aparte? ¿Punto y final? ―zarandeo los brazos cabreada por sus dudas.          ―No lo sé, Mara, no lo sé.          ―Mira, tenemos tres opciones. ―Enumero con los dedos―. Una. Te vas y se acabó. Dos. Follamos, te vas y se acabó. Tres. Follamos y hasta la semana que viene, como hemos hecho este puto año.

<h3>Join Me on a Literacy Journey</h3>
<p>My name is Debbie Glade. I am a journalist, small press publisher (Smart Poodle Publishing) and the author and illustrator of the award winning children's book, <strong><em>The Travel Adventures of Lilly P. Badilly: Costa Rica</em></strong>.  The book is about a plucky millipede girl who loves to read and play piano. She lives in the Miami Airport with her grandparents. One day they sneak aboard a plane and fly to Costa Rica for a really fun adventure. Lilly uses her brain and her music to save her and her family and friends from a millipede-chomping spider. Each book comes with a fully narrated CD, complete with voice overs, sound effects from the real Costa Rican rain forest and an original musical score with songs performed by me and my family. The story is both funny and educational, and the CD allows kids too young to read or those struggling to read to listen along with the book.</p>
<h3>Why I'm Creating this Campaign</h3>
<p>I visit schools, camps, libaries and charities in South Florida along with my reading, writing and geography programs. My passion is spreading the love of reading and teaching kids about geography, a subject greatly lacking in our schools. Many of the students I visit are in districts with some of the country's highest drop-out rates. What I find is that the children from the lowest income famies, who could most benefit from my book, simply cannot afford to buy the book. The high quality 64-page book/CD retails for $19.95, yet I deeply discount the book during all author visits - up to more than 50%. Even with the discount, many students' parents cannot afford to buy books. I give as much as I can, but I'd like to give many more books away to those who really need them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Campaign Goals</h3>
<p>My goals are straight forward. I'd like to raise $18,500, which is enough money to cover the production costs for 3,000 high quality, hard-cover, 64-page, full-color books with a CD. I will give every book away to needy elementary age students.</p>
<h3>Where the Donations Go</h3>
<p>Any and all funds raised, whether or not we meet, or even surpass our goals, will go toward providing free books to children who could most benefit from them. If we exceed our fundraising goals, we can always print more books.</p>
<h3>About the Smart Poodle</h3>
<p>Darwin is my gigantic and smart 3 yo standard poodle who seems to draw a lot of attention due to his size (5 ft. 3"" from the bottom of his back foot to the top of his head) and cuteness. He's gentle and loyal and so smart that he has been known to push my cell phone with his nose closer to me so I can text the owner of his best canine friend, Joey, and let her know we're ready to go for a walk.</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>We are offering you a wide selection of donation levels and unique perks to match. Get your name put into books as the donator. Get a personalized autographed copy of the book/CD. Receive a phone call from Lilly Badilly. Or even choose the school or charity where you'd like the books to be donated. These are just some of the many perks we are offering. Please note that the delivery of perks is estimated in June, however author visits where books will be donated may take place any time from June through December, 2013.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I often hear from teachers, librarians and parents that a reluctant reader really enjoyed my book, especially because that reader could listen to the entertaining and sometimes hilarious CD. I recently got an email from the dad of a 4-year old girl. He told me his daughter checked my book out of the public library 5 times because she loves the CD! This is big news, because a person's reading comprehension level is the greatest indicator of his or her financial success as an adult. There's no substitute for holding a real book in your hands, turning the pages, looking at the illustrations and wanting to learn. Your donation can make a huge difference in the life of a child; the gift of reading is one of the greatest gifts anyone can give.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether or not you are in a position to help out financially, please help spread the word about our cause. You can feel confident that it is a 100% positive, wholesome, feel good venture. You can use the Indiegogo share tools to get started.</p>
<p>We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your support!</p>

<h2><strong>Who We Are</strong></h2>
<p>Hello. We have been running a poetry publishing site for over a year now, and want to take our ideas to the next level. We want to turn our endeavours into a full-blown publishing house, not just poetry but literature also.</p>
<p>The world of publishing is changing rapidly, with the advent of self-publishing, and the increasing remoteness of the big publishing houses who are sticking with the safe titles.

<p>We believe that the world always needs literature, to take away the dull and dim veneer that covers our lives. And we believe that we can bring the best new poetry and literature into the world with our endeavours.</p>
<p>And to make this possible, we need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What your money will do</strong></h2>
<p>What will the money be going toward? Well, it will make it possible for us to achieve this goal. We need money for:</p>
<p>Marketing and advertising costs</p>
<p>Website Design</p>
<p>Costs of print runs</p>

<p>We add on board another collaborator, <strong>Mihai Dinelscu</strong>, to help us with a professional crew to film and edit the pilot.  </p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Joshua Guess. For the last several years I have been writing as a hobby, then part-time job. Now I'm on the edge of going full-time, but I need your help. I ran a campaign previously for the first novel in a series, <em>Victim Zero</em>, which tells the story of how the zombie apocalypse began in my <em>Living With the Dead </em>universe. While that campaign didn't reach its goal, the success we achieved together gave me enough time to finish and publish <em>Victim Zero.</em></p>
<p>That novel is doing well. Enough that I want to strike while the iron is hot and write the sequel I've been planning. So many ideas, so little time! </p>
<p>That's where your help comes in. If you read and enjoyed <em>Victim Zero </em>and/or my <em>Living With the Dead </em>series, then supporting this campaign will help me bring you more of the same. My outlook right now is as positive as it has ever been, and when the royalties from June hit my bank account in August, I should be in a financial situation where I can write full-time, even if it means eating cheap and turning off the air conditioning. </p>
<p>But to make it that long, I need your support. This campaign is intended to keep the lights on and let me spend the next six to eight weeks writing. The period of time between now and August is a bridge I need your help in crossing. It doesn't take much to help change someone's life. A few dollars here, sharing a link there. If this campaign is successful it will allow me to go for broke and be a full-time writer now. </p>
<p>See? It's that easy to make a dream come true.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p><em>Victim Zero</em> was about how The Fall began and the man responsible, Kell McDonald. The story follows Kell shortly before the outbreak and long after as he struggles to cope with his part in the end of the world. </p>
<p><em>Dead Will Rise </em>continues his tale. It's a smaller story told over a shorter time that chronicles Kell's effort to deal with his losses. With the zombie apocalypse as the backdrop, DWR is at its core an examination of how the weight of the world bends and distorts the man whose shoulders hold it. <em>Victim Zero </em>is the first leg of the journey and focuses on survival. </p>
<p><em>Dead Will Rise </em>is about learning to live.</p>

<p>Many campaigns get vague with where your money goes. Some are for things like board games that require a lot of cost for materials and the like. While a portion of the proceeds from this campaign will go to costs such as cover art, editing, fulfillment of perks and shipping costs, this <em>is </em>a campaign for a book. What you're doing by supporting <em>Dead Will Rise </em>is helping me afford writing full-time for the next few months while <em>also </em>getting unique, cool rewards for doing so. </p>
<p>It's a total win-win. </p>
<p>Rather than list the perks here, which are right there -------&gt; in the sidebar, I'll just give you the action-packed synopsis of the kinds of things you can get by supporting this campaign. </p>
<p>Perks start at five dollars, with everyone from that level and up getting an eBook version of <em>Dead Will Rise </em>as well as an exclusive short story written just for this campaign. From there it gets very interesting! I'll be doing a print version perk, another for personalized signed copies, a perk allowing you to beta read the book and give your feedback, making you a part of the process. I'll even write a short novella for you if, in the words of the immortal Bob barker, the price is right! Yep, you haven't gone nuts. For the top tier I will work with you to write an original novella using you as the main character, set in the <em>Living With the Dead </em>universe. The best part? When we're done, you totally own it. Publish it yourself, let it gather dust on your hard drive, sell it for charity, whatever you want. The rights are yours!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign will change my world. I'm modest, to be frank, and I don't think my writing will have the same effect on the world as success here would have on me. You, the fans, do seem to enjoy reading my books and I certainly love writing them. I like looking at this genre from different angles, telling stories you never really see elsewhere.</p>
<p>I get to entertain. I became a writer because I'm a reader. I read a lot and have since I was a kid. There is no feeling better than falling into a world and feeling your pulse pound as the main character struggles and triumphs. I want to write this book because enough of you expressed your satisfaction with <em>Victim Zero </em>and a desire for a sequel pretty much NOW. You asked, and this is me trying to come through. </p>
<p>If this campaign isn't successful I'll have to pick up a full-time job soon. I'll still work on DWR but it will take longer. As a flexible funding campaign I will get your contribution shortly after you make it, allowing me to pay editors, artists, formatters, and my bills to keep on writing. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some of my most hardcore readers are, in an interesting slice of spectrum, college students and retired people. Two groups who generally live on fixed incomes. Because I will never ask any of you to spend money on me or my work if you can't afford it (been there myself more than once and recently, too!), please don't feel bad if you don't have the ability to do so. I say this because a few people backed the last campaign but had to scrape up the money to do it. </p>
<p>That's super nice of you, but please don't feel you have to do that! </p>
<p>If you want to help but money is a problem there are other ways you can show your love. On this very campaign page are sharing tools for Facebook, Twitter, and the rest. Share a link, write a blurb about me and my work, spend a few minutes chatting with a friend who might want to help out. These campaigns work because fantastic friends and readers like you take the time out of your day to share and spread the word. If you can't back in dollars, then simply backing me up with kind words (and word-of-mouth) is more than enough. </p>
</div></div>","My Story
My name is Joshua Guess. For the last several years I have been writing as a hobby, then part-time job. Now I'm on the edge of going full-time, but I need your help. I ran a campaign previously for the first novel in a series, Victim Zero, which tells the story of how the zombie apocalypse began in my Living With the Dead universe. While that campaign didn't reach its goal, the success we achieved together gave me enough time to finish and publish Victim Zero.
That novel is doing well. Enough that I want to strike while the iron is hot and write the sequel I've been planning. So many ideas, so little time! 
That's where your help comes in. If you read and enjoyed Victim Zero and/or my Living With the Dead series, then supporting this campaign will help me bring you more of the same. My outlook right now is as positive as it has ever been, and when the royalties from June hit my bank account in August, I should be in a financial situation where I can write full-time, even if it means eating cheap and turning off the air conditioning. 
But to make it that long, I need your support. This campaign is intended to keep the lights on and let me spend the next six to eight weeks writing. The period of time between now and August is a bridge I need your help in crossing. It doesn't take much to help change someone's life. A few dollars here, sharing a link there. If this campaign is successful it will allow me to go for broke and be a full-time writer now. 
See? It's that easy to make a dream come true.
 
The Book
Victim Zero was about how The Fall began and the man responsible, Kell McDonald. The story follows Kell shortly before the outbreak and long after as he struggles to cope with his part in the end of the world. 
Dead Will Rise continues his tale. It's a smaller story told over a shorter time that chronicles Kell's effort to deal with his losses. With the zombie apocalypse as the backdrop, DWR is at its core an examination of how the weight of the world bends and distorts the man whose shoulders hold it. Victim Zero is the first leg of the journey and focuses on survival. 
Dead Will Rise is about learning to live.

Many campaigns get vague with where your money goes. Some are for things like board games that require a lot of cost for materials and the like. While a portion of the proceeds from this campaign will go to costs such as cover art, editing, fulfillment of perks and shipping costs, this is a campaign for a book.

<p>
</p>
<p>Welcome to The Art and Science of Digital Music Distribution. This 
soon to be published book is a teaching
tool for Music Artists, Labels, Media Engineers and anyone else with an 
interest in
publicizing recorded music. Why write this book? After conversing with
many people in the entertainment industry I have concluded that there 
are thousands of
entertainment professionals who have no concept of what it means to 
accurately create an MP3 file or an audio CD and to populate the
MP3 file or audio CD with Metadata Tags such as the Artist Name, Album 
Name, Tracking Numbers,
Publisher Name, Et cetera. In fact many studio enthusiasts will simply 
mix their projects
straight down to an MP3 file without any customization. This soon to be 
published book explains why creating a CD or MP3 file without any 
customization causes loss of advertising and revenue, and the book 
teaches artists how to use the same free software that is used by major 
music retail outlets to create and distribute trackable music.</p>

<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>My name is Christa Charter and I am the author of two crime novels set in the video game industry: Schooled (Lexy Cooper #1) and Pwned (Lexy Cooper #2). I'm in the process of writing the third book in the series. </p>
<p>Before I wrote books I worked in the video game industry for nearly two decades. I spent 8 years at Microsoft's Xbox as web editor/community manager/video hostess Trixie360.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why I Want To Go To Roswell, NM</h3>
<p>In my third Lexy Cooper novel, the company Lexy works for--Xenon Corporation--is getting ready to launch their next-generation console to replace the Xenon 24/7. And to launch it properly into the world, Xenon is throwing a big party (much like the Xbox 360 launch event ""Zero Hour""). The event will take place at a decommissioned air force base: Walker AFB, just outside of Roswell. </p>
<p>The hitch in this plan is that I've never been to Roswell or New Mexico at all. For me, realism is important in my novels. My books are ripe with Seattle and Redmond details down to the menu items in restaurants. I want to accurately represent the sights, sounds, and smells of Roswell and Walker AFB in the most important part of the new book--and maybe even the series.</p>

</div></span></span></div>","Who I Am
My name is Christa Charter and I am the author of two crime novels set in the video game industry: Schooled (Lexy Cooper #1) and Pwned (Lexy Cooper #2). I'm in the process of writing the third book in the series. 
Before I wrote books I worked in the video game industry for nearly two decades. I spent 8 years at Microsoft's Xbox as web editor/community manager/video hostess Trixie360.


Why I Want To Go To Roswell, NM
In my third Lexy Cooper novel, the company Lexy works for--Xenon Corporation--is getting ready to launch their next-generation console to replace the Xenon 24/7. And to launch it properly into the world, Xenon is throwing a big party (much like the Xbox 360 launch event ""Zero Hour""). The event will take place at a decommissioned air force base: Walker AFB, just outside of Roswell. 
The hitch in this plan is that I've never been to Roswell or New Mexico at all. For me, realism is important in my novels. My books are ripe with Seattle and Redmond details down to the menu items in restaurants. I want to accurately represent the sights, sounds, and smells of Roswell and Walker AFB in the most important part of the new book--and maybe even the series.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>
I grew up being a storyteller. I began telling
stories when I was five years old. I would make up stories about my dolls and
tell them to my mother. My first grade class journal was filled with stories
about my cats and dogs, but I had none! In sixth grade, I started writing down
my stories and bugged my literary teacher to read them and correct my mistakes.
I had envisioned the world I was writing about as a movie in my mind. Every
sentence I saw a new angle, and each paragraph became a new scene. As the years
went on, I began to be interested in writing for the silver screen.<br/></p>
<p>
<i>A Thorn</i> is an idea I’ve been working on since my freshman
year at RIT. But a lot has changed from then. This story was a challenge for me
to write. I haven’t had a traumatic experience like my main character
experienced. The main character is compelling to me because despite everything
she has been through, she manages to make beautiful music; like creating beauty
out of chaos. I wanted to tell a story that can be close to the
truth as possible. Someone known to the victim commits approximately two-thirds
of assaults and thirty-eight percent of rapists are a friend or acquaintance.
On top of that sixty percent of assaults are not reported. Knowing these
statistics, I created my story. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need funds to help pay for the costs of printing and binding my scripts for the actors to read at the table read presentation. I also have to print out a ""playbill"" to hand out to the attendees at my event. After this presentation, I will use whatever funds available to send my script out to film festivals so it can be picked up and eventually turned into a movie. That is my ultimate goal and I hope you can help me.</p>
<p>What you get:</p>
<p>$5 - electronic thank you note</p>
<p>$15 - handwritten thank you note</p>
<p>$25 - 1 page story with YOU as the main character &amp; special thanks in my playbill page</p>
<p>$50 - 5 page story with YOU as the main character &amp; special thanks in my playbill</p>
<p>$100 - 10 page story with YOU as the main character &amp; special thanks &amp; copy of my play bill</p>
<p>$125 - 10 page story with YOU as the main character &amp; honorable mention &amp; copy of my playbill &amp; signed copy of my script.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>

Sometimes trauma happens to an individual and
nobody knows why or how to deal with a sudden change in their behavior. It can
be mistaken as a phase. I wanted this story to raise awareness to behavior
and how sometimes their outbursts might not be just a teen rebellious phase.
They might seem attention seeking, but there could be a reason for it. So don’t
be afraid to ask, to push them to answer you. Maybe that’s what they want you
to do. <div><div><div>

""The world is everywhere whispering essays."" --Alexander Smith
We are an all-volunteer, independent nonprofit press devoted to publishing & celebrating the essay, in all its forms. CLICK HERE TO LEARN MORE.
The essay is a chameleon, at once formal and scholarly, lyrical and narrative, personal and political, educational and secretive, humorous and curmudgeonly, loud and quiet. It is endangered and dangerous, adaptable and perishable. Your contributions will help us put bold and provocative literature into the hands of readers, writers, students, and teachers. 

ALL OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS WE RECEIVE COME FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVE IN INDEPENDENT PUBLISHING.
HOW YOU CAN HELP SUPPORT OUR WORK


All contributions collected from this Indiegogo campaign will be directed toward the printing and distribution of our second print book, ESSAYING THE ESSAY, edited by David Lazar.

ESSAYING THE ESSAY is a must-have compendium of essays on the essay, showcasing diverse meditations on the form  by a wide range of writers throughout history, including Michel de Montaigne, Samuel Johnson, Virginia Woolf, Cynthia Ozick, Phillip Lopate, Robert Atwan, Lia Purpura, and John D'Agata.


Your support will help build our self-sufficiency (pre-press, printing, and advertising are expensive; the larger the print run, the lower the cost per title; distributing books costs money too).
The more funding we secure, the greater the possibility for us to offer:


Discounts for students, teachers, and writers.

Letterpress-printed, limited-edition versions of our titles, whose sales will help futher support our publishing and educational activities.

Publishing internships to more students.

Our first Indiegogo campaign, Everywhere Whispering Essays, funded the printing and distribution of our first print title, You. An Anthology of Essays Devoted to the Second Person, edited by Kim Dana Kupperman, with Heather G. Simons and James M. Chesbro.
YOU. AN ANTHOLOGY is a first-of-its-kind collection, featuring essays that explore failure, planetary movement, and love, among a variety of topics. The up close and personal candor of these autobiographical, lyric, personal, and segmented narratives is tempered by the distance, intimacy, humor, and unsentimental tenderness that the second-person point of view affords both writer and reader.OUR TRACK RECORD


Welcome Table Press has published (and distributed at no cost) ten electronic and six limited-edition, print issues of its periodical pamphlet series, OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON PRACTICE & FORM, featuring spoken essays derived from talks delivered at symposia, conferences, and other gatherings where friends of the essay might be found. Currently in production are six additional issues.
Two  co-sponsored by   Fordham University's Creative Writing Program and featuring Robert Atwan, Vivian Gornick, Phillip Lopate, Jerald Walker, Brian Doyle, Lia Purpura, Barbara Hurd, Robin Hemley, Idiots' Books, editors from national periodicals, and many other writers and teachers of the essay.                 Click HERE to download FREE PDFs of these important essays. 

Welcome Table Press is home to FOOD FOR THOUGHT, a hand-sewn, miniature/limited-edition periodical whose two volumes were published between 2002-2006 and featured lyric essays, poetry, and recipes for local, seasonal dishes. The twelve issues of FOOD FOR THOUGHT are preserved at SUNY Buffalo's Special Collections library.
We plan to re-create FOOD FOR THOUGHT NOTES as a series of video essays.
Because we are dedicated to spreading the word about the essay, our press has hosted and co-sponsored several low-cost or free educational events, including:
Two symposia on the essay, co-sponsored by      
Fordham University's Creative Writing Program andfeaturing Robert Atwan, Vivian Gornick, Phillip Lopate, Jerald Walker, Brian Doyle, Lia Purpura, Barbara Hurd, Robin Hemley, Idiots' Books, editors from national periodicals, and many other writers and teachers of the essay.

Internships for creative-writing students: we have been working with editorial interns for several years 
and are currently working with the Fairfield University's low-residency MFA Program to provide internships in its publishing concentration.

A book arts workshop in a rural community.

Fundraiser readings by the literary touring group Three Genres in the Rain, which benefitted organizations devoted to the reading and writing.
YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Welcome Table Press was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 2008 and granted 501(c)(3) status in 2009.



OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:
We know that not everyone can contribute to this fundraising campaign. But here's what you can do:

<p>While 29-year-old Libby Morgan is
fulfilling her ten-year-long dream: to witness and photograph a hot-air balloon
“fall freedom festival” at the Grand Canyon, a spontaneous side-trip in her RV
puts her in the path of 35-year-old Joe King, the disillusioned former country
music headliner. <br/></p><p>Weary of carrying his horn-dog, irresponsible, albeit
insanely-talented younger brother, Chuck, Joe is trying to keep his anger
contained for just two more weeks. Two weeks…to finish the humiliating
opening-act tour his loathsome manager forced on him as TBK’s contract finally expires.
Joe has sights set on change—but how will that change affect The Brothers King? <br/></p><p>A chance encounter brings Libby face-to-face with a nightmare from her past,

<br/><br/><h3>MORE Inspiration (and the love!):</h3>Because the inspiration for Whirlwind Love came from Christian Kane's Live in London CD,  Brand X Management and Christian would allow me to include a copy with certain levels--so there are THIRTY CDs set aside--and I hope you will not only support publication of my novel, but also Christian's CD--because it's fantastic!

Well...my ideal scenario will allow me to be my own pubisher--start my own publishing business, so that the two sequels that follow WHIRLWIND LOVE (namely, LEAD THE WIND and WINDWARD), will have a home and you...being the generous, thoughtful contributor will be the first to know about them (and know I'll do everything in my power to be as generous to you when that time comes!). If I cannot reach my goal, then I'll have to choose an option that puts others in control of my destiny--and none of us would want that, now would we?

<p>Medically retired FBI agent William Harrison struggles against
his own sense of uselessness while dealing with lies, deceit, and sinister assassins to
discover the truth about a decades-old government cover up of alien contact
code-named, the Saint Mary Project. With the aid of a few trusted companions –
and the guidance of a mysterious informant – Harrison fights hired guns and an
alien-human hybrid to end the cover up, and halt the unimaginable crimes that
Saint Mary and its hidden leaders have committed in the name of national
security.</p>
<p>Harrison’s investigation also reveals a powerful secret about
himself and his family, one that may prove to be the key to ending Saint Mary’s
cover up and crimes.</p>
<p>Finding the truth and fighting back before it is too late takes
Harrison out of his comfortable yet unrewarding life as a private investigator
in Tucson, Arizona, to his childhood home of Los Angeles, the bright lights of
Las Vegas and beyond, into the infamous Area 51, and even to the dingy alleys
of Moscow. Will he and his compatriots prevail, or will Saint Mary’s archaic
overseers remain unaccountable and continue to insurrect the truth that belongs
to us all? Find out in <b>Truth Insurrected: The Saint Mary Project </b>in

<p>To
say the subject is controversial would be an understatement, but that makes it
all the more suitable as the topic for a novel. For decades, perhaps even
centuries, people have seen these unknown craft in the sky or even underwater.
There can be a sharp divide between believers and non-believers, and
controversy about what it all means, especially in the context of alleged government secrecy. That tension, blended with the fundamental

About Truth Insurrected: The Saint Mary Project
Medically retired FBI agent William Harrison struggles against
his own sense of uselessness while dealing with lies, deceit, and sinister assassins to
discover the truth about a decades-old government cover up of alien contact
code-named, the Saint Mary Project. With the aid of a few trusted companions –
and the guidance of a mysterious informant – Harrison fights hired guns and an
alien-human hybrid to end the cover up, and halt the unimaginable crimes that
Saint Mary and its hidden leaders have committed in the name of national
security.
Harrison’s investigation also reveals a powerful secret about
himself and his family, one that may prove to be the key to ending Saint Mary’s
cover up and crimes.
Finding the truth and fighting back before it is too late takes
Harrison out of his comfortable yet unrewarding life as a private investigator
in Tucson, Arizona, to his childhood home of Los Angeles, the bright lights of
Las Vegas and beyond, into the infamous Area 51, and even to the dingy alleys
of Moscow. Will he and his compatriots prevail, or will Saint Mary’s archaic
overseers remain unaccountable and continue to insurrect the truth that belongs
to us all? Find out in Truth Insurrected: The Saint Mary Project in
October 2014.Read All About It!Newspaper headline from July 1947 regarding a pretty amazing recovery. Of course, the story changed soon thereafter. ;) In Truth Insurrected: The Saint Mary Project, the Roswell UFO incident figures prominently.Guy Hottel FBI Memo
Guy Hottel was a special agent in charge of the FBI's Washington Field Office. The memo he wrote in March 1950 and sent to the FBI Director concerned flying saucers recovered in New Mexico along with their occupants.
Why UFOs and Aliens?
To
say the subject is controversial would be an understatement, but that makes it
all the more suitable as the topic for a novel. For decades, perhaps even
centuries, people have seen these unknown craft in the sky or even underwater.
There can be a sharp divide between believers and non-believers, and
controversy about what it all means, especially in the context of alleged government secrecy. That tension, blended with the fundamental
question, are we alone?, makes for a great storytelling opportunity.The Aliens Are Coming!
UFOs and aliens have long been an entertainment favorite and readers of Truth Insurrected: The Saint Mary Project will definitely be entertained.

</b></p><h4><i><b>From The Book.... <br/></b></i></h4>He was a
strange looking man, shabbily dressed.<span> 
His dusty black jacket was fashioned like an old style drum major
uniform.  It was threadbare and had a double-breasted row of dull silver buttons running down its front.  He wore a drab silvery-white cloak that had
an insignia across the chest; an insignia that featured an eagle, a winged man,
an ox and a lion, symbols of the <i>four
evangelists.</i></span>
<p>At the
conclusion of the service the man emerged from the shadows and discretely pulled
me aside, away from the congregation as they exited the sanctuary.<span>  He seemed distracted, disturbed, somewhat
agitated, and worried.  He also appeared
to be frightened, yet keenly observant and decidedly sensitive
to everything and everyone in the church building.  He constantly turned his head one way, then
another, scanning the crowds of people as they exited the church.  He was looking for something.  Or someone. 
He leaned close to me, placing his hand in the small of my back to draw
me closer, and then he spoke, yet without ever really looking at me, his eyes
constantly scanning the people as they exited the sanctuary. </span></p>
<p>“This is
for you.<span>  Put it in your suit pocket,
quickly.”</span></p>
<p>He
hurriedly pulled a manila envelop that contained what appeared to be a small
ancient scroll, a rough, faded parchment, from under his coat and handed it to
me.<span>  His hands were trembling.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">---- 000 ---</p>

<p><b>So

Martyr</i>.</b><span><b> </b> Readers will explore <i>Extraordinary Places,</i> including <i>Christ Cathedral: The Church Of The Final

<p><b><i>Here’s more from the opening of the book…</i></b></p>
<p>Special
instructions were given concerning the ancient scroll, titled <i>A Psalm of the Apocalypse</i>:<span>  “I was to translate and eventually interpret <i>A Psalm of the Apocalypse,</i> written by a
boy, John the Younger.  It was originally
written in New Testament <i>Koine Greek</i>,
with some stanzas written in <i>Aramaic.</i>  The translation revealed that the parchment
was actually a sonnet, a psalm or psalter of the <i>Apocalypse,</i> comprised of a series of unbalanced verses and poetic
stanzas.  In substance, it was a faint
foreshadowing of the end of what is and the beginning of what is yet to</span> be. “ </p>

<p><b>Destiny is a fragile thing!</b><span><b> 
Delicate!  So too are dreams</b> --
and choices!  It’s choice, and the consequence of our choices – not chance –
that shapes and determines destiny.  Our choice can also hurt or help others fulfill their destiny.</span></p><p><span></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FDfxgDtDLtcU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDfxgDtDLtcU&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FDfxgDtDLtcU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div>  <p></p>
<p>I chose to publish my first book at the tender age of
4.<span>  I drew and colored all kinds of stuff,
mostly bull frogs and butterflies – and momma stapled the pages together.  My first book!  </span></p>
<p>My second book?<span> 
Fourth grade.  A book of poems and
sketches of all kinds of stuff, mostly bull frogs and butterflies.  Momma three-hole-punched the pages and put them
into a three-ringed binder.  My second book.</span></p>
<p>I’m only telling you about these two books because I
thought you should know -- I have writing experience.</p>
<p>Then, something happened.<span> 
It happened to you too.  You grew
up – and so did I.  And, well, many of those
childhood dreams sort of fell by the wayside.</span></p>
<p><b>Destiny is a fragile thing!</b><b> 
Delicate!  So too are dreams</b><span>!</span></p>
<p>I graduated.  Married (Yeah)<span>  A lovely
wife.  Three beautiful children.  A mortgage (yech!) 
Two dogs.  Double car garage.  You get the idea. But here’s an idea -- the
winds of destiny sometimes blow when we least expect them – and in ways we
hadn’t anticipated.  </span></p>
<p>A Call.<span>  God issued a
Call to me. (salvation) He issues the same call to each of us.  “The grace of God that brings salvation hath
appeared to every man.”  “Be ye saved all
ye ends of the earth.”  Then, God sent me
a Challenge (full-time ministry).  I
responded by making a Commitment (to serve Him as a pastor).  </span></p>
<p>Now, many decades later I look back as a seasoned
pastor and share that I have served three congregations and I’m still running
the race in the 24<sup>th</sup> year of my fourth pastorate.</p>
<p>In the midst of it all I sporadically sensed stirrings that were
impossible to ignore yet impossible to fulfill because of the demands and
pressures of pastoral ministry– stirrings to write.<span>  Stirrings!  I often suppressed them.  How often did I say, “I wish… I wish…”  But I never did.</span></p>
<p>I believe you understand.<span> 
I really do. </span></p>
<p><b>Destiny is a fragile thing!</b><b> 
Delicate!  So too are dreams</b><span>!</span></p>
<p>“I wish… I wish… ”<span> 
But I never did.</span></p>
<p>A wish is a
hope, a desire to do something that we haven’t yet done. We know how to wish,
don’t we?<span>  We know how to wish because we
all have hopes, and dreams and desires -- wishes! </span>But,
sometimes, dreams, hopes and wishes sort of fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>Can
I let you in on a little secret?  I
believe sometimes God peeks at us and smiles through the unplanned moments of
life!  He does this because He knows all
about our forgotten dreams, hopes and wishes.</p>
<p>God peeked and
smiled at me through the Walt Disney cartoon character -- Jiminy Cricket.<span>  By Jiminy! 
God has a sense of humor!  How do
I know?  Imagine, God using a cartoon
character of all things.  There He stood,
smiling and peeking at me in the midst of one of those unplanned moments of my
life.  He pointed his finger at me
through Jiminy Cricket who was skipping and dancing across the screen of my
television set – and here’s what he said… </span></p>
<p></p>
<p align=""center""><i>When you wish upon a star; </i></p>
<p align=""center""><i>Makes no difference who you are</i></p>
<p align=""center""><i>Anything your heart desires will come to you</i><i>.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the
message I received -- <em><b>""it makes no difference who you are""</b></em>
Anyone!<span>  Everyone!  Any age! 
Make a wish!  Dream a dream.  And strive to fulfill your destiny!  Do that which God has placed on your heart,
and do it well1  By the way, Jesus in John
15:7 tells us to “<em><b>ask whatever you WISH [theleo], and it will be done
for you.</b></em> [ESV -- English Standard Version]</span></p>
<p>Writing for me
is a delicate thing.<span>  It is a fragile
desire, a small part of a larger dream… a destiny rooted in childhood and woven
into the fabric of my life.  </span></p>
<p>One final note
in this About Me section.<span>  Every Sunday
when I stand to share a message from God I see God’s people, the congregation
seated in the Sanctuary.  High above
them, near the vaulted ceiling are flags, flags representing 34 American states
and the </span>District of Columbia.<span>  In the aftermath of hurricane Katrina our
church and community were destroyed and the entire population was displaced.  People from across </span>America came – gave
time, money and effort – to build us a new church.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Each Sunday I
have a visual illustration, a reminder of the Grace of God and the Generosity of
His people.<span>  We couldn’t have built this
new, debt free church without the help and generosity of His people from across
the country.  In like manner, this aspect
of ministry, this campaign can only be done through grace and generosity – to
fulfill the dream.</span></p>

</p><p>Thank
you for visiting my campaign.<span>  I’ve
been consumed for more than a year in writing and completing – <i>The Last Martyr – and I’ve felt God’s
guidance in many marvelous and mysterious ways! 
</i>I have a calm assurance that <i>The
Last Martyr</i> will be published – I am convinced of that!  </span></p>
<p><i>The Last Martyr</i> focuses on (1) the conflict between science and religion,
(2) between atheism and theism, (3) between that which is secular and that
which is sacred – from a biblical perspective – cloaked in the context of

<p>Many, within the Christian
community, have protested through pen and pulpit, the derelict state of the
Christian mind.  This book  -- <i>The
Last Martyr</i>  -- introduces and
orients the reader to critical biblical thinking -- with a clarity that fosters
biblical thought and facilitates Bible comprehension – utilizing the
fascinating narration that details the final journey of <i>The Last Martyr!</i> </p>
<p><i>The Last Martyr</i>  also touches
upon other competing Classical and Contemporary ideologies, philosophies,
theologies and scientific positions that are currently vogue and viewed as
culturally relevant by contemporary thinkers 
– while clarifying and contrasting their conflicts and compatibilities
with the biblical revelation. </p>

---- 000 ---A Metaphor.  It’s Beautiful.
Look.  On God’s Finger. Look.
A Butterfly.---- 000 ---
Catch the Vision!  This campaign is more than publishing a book, or two!  Its a Vision of touching people beyond pastoral ministry!  Its a long-time vision of extending my pastoral ministry into the field of writing with multiple goals -- touching lives and strengthening families!
From The Book.... He was a
strange looking man, shabbily dressed. 
His dusty black jacket was fashioned like an old style drum major
uniform.  It was threadbare and had a double-breasted row of dull silver buttons running down its front.  He wore a drab silvery-white cloak that had
an insignia across the chest; an insignia that featured an eagle, a winged man,
an ox and a lion, symbols of the four
evangelists.
At the
conclusion of the service the man emerged from the shadows and discretely pulled
me aside, away from the congregation as they exited the sanctuary.  He seemed distracted, disturbed, somewhat
agitated, and worried.  He also appeared
to be frightened, yet keenly observant and decidedly sensitive
to everything and everyone in the church building.  He constantly turned his head one way, then
another, scanning the crowds of people as they exited the church.  He was looking for something.  Or someone. 
He leaned close to me, placing his hand in the small of my back to draw
me closer, and then he spoke, yet without ever really looking at me, his eyes
constantly scanning the people as they exited the sanctuary. 
“This is
for you.  Put it in your suit pocket,
quickly.”
He
hurriedly pulled a manila envelop that contained what appeared to be a small
ancient scroll, a rough, faded parchment, from under his coat and handed it to
me.  His hands were trembling.
---- 000 ---

So
begins the journey of John, The Last
Martyr.  Readers will explore Extraordinary Places, including Christ Cathedral: The Church Of The Final
Judgment; the Grand Library of Christ Cathedral with its Hidden Treasures
and Ancient Artifacts; The Chapel of the
Candle, plus mysterious Gothic
Cathedrals, Ancient Chapels, Labyrinths, Bell Towers and the other-worldly site of the ancient Menorah whose majestic flames control
the flow of time and history.
Through The Last Martyr readers will marvel over
the powerful imagery of Towering Frescoes
depicting the Great White Throne
Judgment, the Judgment Seat of
Christ, The Lamb’s Book of Life, and many more mysterious medieval motifs
and biblical images. 
---- 000 ---

Here’s more from the opening of the book…
Special
instructions were given concerning the ancient scroll, titled A Psalm of the Apocalypse:  “I was to translate and eventually interpret A Psalm of the Apocalypse, written by a
boy, John the Younger.  It was originally
written in New Testament Koine Greek,
with some stanzas written in Aramaic.  The translation revealed that the parchment
was actually a sonnet, a psalm or psalter of the Apocalypse, comprised of a series of unbalanced verses and poetic
stanzas.  In substance, it was a faint
foreshadowing of the end of what is and the beginning of what is yet to be. “ 


About Me


A
Call   A Challenge  A Commitment
Destiny is a fragile thing! 
Delicate!  So too are dreams --
and choices!  It’s choice, and the consequence of our choices – not chance –
that shapes and determines destiny.  Our choice can also hurt or help others fulfill their destiny.  
I chose to publish my first book at the tender age of
4.  I drew and colored all kinds of stuff,
mostly bull frogs and butterflies – and momma stapled the pages together.  My first book!  
My second book? 
Fourth grade.  A book of poems and
sketches of all kinds of stuff, mostly bull frogs and butterflies.  Momma three-hole-punched the pages and put them
into a three-ringed binder.  My second book.
I’m only telling you about these two books because I
thought you should know -- I have writing experience.
Then, something happened. 
It happened to you too.  You grew
up – and so did I.  And, well, many of those
childhood dreams sort of fell by the wayside.
Destiny is a fragile thing! 
Delicate!  So too are dreams!
I graduated.  Married (Yeah)  A lovely
wife.  Three beautiful children.  A mortgage (yech!) 
Two dogs.  Double car garage.  You get the idea. But here’s an idea -- the
winds of destiny sometimes blow when we least expect them – and in ways we
hadn’t anticipated.  
A Call.  God issued a
Call to me. (salvation) He issues the same call to each of us.  “The grace of God that brings salvation hath
appeared to every man.”  “Be ye saved all
ye ends of the earth.”  Then, God sent me
a Challenge (full-time ministry).  I
responded by making a Commitment (to serve Him as a pastor).  
Now, many decades later I look back as a seasoned
pastor and share that I have served three congregations and I’m still running
the race in the 24th year of my fourth pastorate.
In the midst of it all I sporadically sensed stirrings that were
impossible to ignore yet impossible to fulfill because of the demands and
pressures of pastoral ministry– stirrings to write.  Stirrings!  I often suppressed them.  How often did I say, “I wish… I wish…”  But I never did.
I believe you understand. 
I really do. 
Destiny is a fragile thing! 
Delicate!  So too are dreams!
“I wish… I wish… ” 
But I never did.
A wish is a
hope, a desire to do something that we haven’t yet done. We know how to wish,
don’t we?  We know how to wish because we
all have hopes, and dreams and desires -- wishes! But,
sometimes, dreams, hopes and wishes sort of fall by the wayside.
Can
I let you in on a little secret?  I
believe sometimes God peeks at us and smiles through the unplanned moments of
life!  He does this because He knows all
about our forgotten dreams, hopes and wishes.
God peeked and
smiled at me through the Walt Disney cartoon character -- Jiminy Cricket.  By Jiminy! 
God has a sense of humor!  How do
I know?  Imagine, God using a cartoon
character of all things.  There He stood,
smiling and peeking at me in the midst of one of those unplanned moments of my
life.  He pointed his finger at me
through Jiminy Cricket who was skipping and dancing across the screen of my
television set – and here’s what he said… 

When you wish upon a star; 
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you.

Here’s the
message I received -- ""it makes no difference who you are""
Anyone!  Everyone!  Any age! 
Make a wish!  Dream a dream.  And strive to fulfill your destiny!  Do that which God has placed on your heart,
and do it well1  By the way, Jesus in John
15:7 tells us to “ask whatever you WISH [theleo], and it will be done
for you. [ESV -- English Standard Version]
Writing for me
is a delicate thing.  It is a fragile
desire, a small part of a larger dream… a destiny rooted in childhood and woven
into the fabric of my life.  
One final note
in this About Me section.  Every Sunday
when I stand to share a message from God I see God’s people, the congregation
seated in the Sanctuary.  High above
them, near the vaulted ceiling are flags, flags representing 34 American states
and the District of Columbia.  In the aftermath of hurricane Katrina our
church and community were destroyed and the entire population was displaced.  People from across America came – gave
time, money and effort – to build us a new church.  
Each Sunday I
have a visual illustration, a reminder of the Grace of God and the Generosity of
His people.  We couldn’t have built this
new, debt free church without the help and generosity of His people from across
the country.  In like manner, this aspect
of ministry, this campaign can only be done through grace and generosity – to
fulfill the dream.
Destiny is a fragile thing! 
Delicate!  So too are dreams!Sometimes
God peeks at us & smiles through the unplanned moments of life!Jesus
is our Hope!  His People -- our Help!
Thank
you for visiting my campaign.  I’ve
been consumed for more than a year in writing and completing – The Last Martyr – and I’ve felt God’s
guidance in many marvelous and mysterious ways! 
I have a calm assurance that The
Last Martyr will be published – I am convinced of that!  
The Last Martyr focuses on (1) the conflict between science and religion,
(2) between atheism and theism, (3) between that which is secular and that
which is sacred – from a biblical perspective – cloaked in the context of
biblical fiction.

<div class=""im"">
<div>Berim is about getting people outside of Iran to advocate for policies that give support Iranian social entrepenuers.  Let me explain: </div>
<div> <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Over 60% of Iran's population is under 30 and are educated, tech savy. Everyday there are people in Iran are doing awesome things from job training for women, conserving the environment and advocating for clean air. </span>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Instead of standing by these everyday heroes the international community is enacting policies that make their lives harder.</strong>  Policies like sanctions are the economic equivalent of cluster bombs.  They don't discriminate. They make it harder for activists in Iran to get access to technology and cutting edge tools we enjoy in the west to run effective campaigns. </div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div class=""im"">
<div>
<strong>We can change this. </strong> There are politicians in Australia and the United States and all over the world that want to do better on Iran.  However as representatives they can't act unless we show that their communities are behind them.  By standing together and pushing for better policies in our countries we can help give the people in Iran the space they need to create change.  </div>
</div>
<div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>
<strong>Helping build a free Iran is a key step to creating peace in the Middle East.  </strong>The Iranian Government sends weapons to Syria so that Assad can eliminate his opposition.  Also when people in the Iranian Government make deeply anti-semitic statements they make it harder to have sensible critiques of Israel. </div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
</div>
<div class=""im"">
<div>
<strong>By standing with the people of Iran we also safeguard our rights. </strong>When we allow our Governments in Australia, the US etc to trample over the rights of others we create the pathway for them to take away our rights as well.  That's why things like the patriot act and the anti terrorism laws passed.  Drones started as something that would only ever be used in other countries and now they can be used on us, no trials or due process necessary. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Can you become a founding member of Berim and give us $100 help us bring together people outside of Iran to advocate for policies that give everyday heroes in Iran the space they need to create a free Iran? </strong></div>

<div><strong>Where will my money go? </strong></div>

<strong>Collecting stories</strong> about how sanctions are impacting everyday Iranians. </div>
<div class=""im"">
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Producing infographics and videos </strong>that explain why policies like sanctions are making it harder for Iranians to create change in Iran. </div>

</div></div>","Berim is about getting people outside of Iran to advocate for policies that give support Iranian social entrepenuers.  Let me explain: 
 Over 60% of Iran's population is under 30 and are educated, tech savy. Everyday there are people in Iran are doing awesome things from job training for women, conserving the environment and advocating for clean air. 



Instead of standing by these everyday heroes the international community is enacting policies that make their lives harder.  Policies like sanctions are the economic equivalent of cluster bombs.  They don't discriminate. They make it harder for activists in Iran to get access to technology and cutting edge tools we enjoy in the west to run effective campaigns. 




We can change this.  There are politicians in Australia and the United States and all over the world that want to do better on Iran.  However as representatives they can't act unless we show that their communities are behind them.  By standing together and pushing for better policies in our countries we can help give the people in Iran the space they need to create change.  


 

Helping build a free Iran is a key step to creating peace in the Middle East.  The Iranian Government sends weapons to Syria so that Assad can eliminate his opposition.  Also when people in the Iranian Government make deeply anti-semitic statements they make it harder to have sensible critiques of Israel. 
 



By standing with the people of Iran we also safeguard our rights. When we allow our Governments in Australia, the US etc to trample over the rights of others we create the pathway for them to take away our rights as well.  That's why things like the patriot act and the anti terrorism laws passed.  Drones started as something that would only ever be used in other countries and now they can be used on us, no trials or due process necessary. 
 
Can you become a founding member of Berim and give us $100 help us bring together people outside of Iran to advocate for policies that give everyday heroes in Iran the space they need to create a free Iran? 



 
Where will my money go? 

 



Collecting stories about how sanctions are impacting everyday Iranians. 

 

Producing infographics and videos that explain why policies like sanctions are making it harder for Iranians to create change in Iran. 
 


Hold our governments to account by running campaigns that highlight the polices we are enacting that are hindering the ability of social innovators in Iran to be effective.

</h3> <p>For those that don't know, I ran a campaign for this book last year to fund the high cost of editing, and to get a few initial copies of the hardcover and paperback as well. Well now I am seeing that there are a lot more costs I hadn't anticipated. So I am running another short-and-dirty funding campaign, same as the first, to cover the rest of what I will need to get the book published.The book is now written, and fully edited. The cover is designed and 
finished, the interior of all versions (ePub, paperback, hardcover) is 
finished. There is simply nothing else left to do now but publish.  But I need just a little more help to do that.<br/></p>
<h3>About Me</h3>I am a new author, and this is my first book, a labor of love that has taken ten years to complete. I am normally a full time professional artist well known for my werewolf and anthropomorphic artwork. However I have always loved reading, and I was writing from a young age, well before I began doing art. I have always wanted to be an author, however I never thought it was in me to be one. But this book has shown me that not only is it possible, it has awakened in me a new love for writing I've never fully experienced before. The world I am writing about, and the characters that have come to me, have consumed me whole. I am addicted to their story, and it is far from finished. I have a whole series planned, fully written in my head. I just need your help to get this first book published.<br/>(I am going to be using a pen name—Christie Goldenwulfe—for my books, mainly because I want to keep my art and romantica (romantic erotica) writing separate from one another. I generally keep my art ""G"" to ""PG-13"" at the most, but my writing is where I express and explore other parts of myself, and for now my writing is a hard ""R"" or even ""X"" rating.)<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>About The Book</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hunger is a dark, paranormal romance bordering on the erotic (this is
 a mature, adult romance novel on the spicy side.  Meaning there is 
graphic sex scenes and profanities used.  Ohhh myyy!  18+ please!).  It 
is based on my werewolf race I have been developing for decades, the <i>Kierrn</i>,
 and is full of wildness, passion, eroticism, and darkness.  Yet there 
is also humor, moments of tenderness, joy, and genuine love and caring 
between the two main characters.  I love my characters and my story, and I hope you will too.<br/></p>
<p>Please read the plot summary below, and if you are curious, I have made the <a href=""http://www.christygrandjean.com/hunger/hunger-sample/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first two chapters available</a> to read for free to help you decide it you like my style, and my story.  If you
 are intrigued by the characters and enjoy where the story is going, 
please consider contributing to this campaign!  I am offering the book 
and some fun perks for your contribution.  While the book itself will be 
available via Amazon.com and other online sources, these perks will only
 be available through this campaign
and may not be available in the future! </p>
<h4>Plot Summary</h4>
<p><i>Supernatural abilities, arcane magic, killer good looks, animalistic allure… what’s not to love about being a werewolf?  Kain Ulmer wouldn’t change what he is for the world. He lives a carefree transient life where the only thing that matters is the next woman, the next conquest, the next thrill.  The Hunger is the price he pays, the curse that demands he make a human kill every three moons or risk madness.  Yet he considers the cost worth the rewards of ultimate power and freedom.  Kain has everything he could want—until fate brings him to her...<br/><br/>Autumn Sullivan has the perfect life. She lives in the most beautiful place in the world, a cottage nestled in the sanctuary of an ancient redwood forest.  She has realized her dream of owning a beautiful little coffee shop in the quiet Northern California town where she grew up, and her life is free from the complications of men and relationships. Just her and her friends, her shop, her redwoods, and her safe, simple life—until a dark, dangerous stranger disrupts her world and send her passions flaming.<br/><br/>Kain is determined to win this guarded creature, but he cannot know the wild desires they will awaken in one another, nor the danger he will bring to her doorstep. An evil even Kain cannot fathom targets Autumn, and they both must race to find answers, and a safe haven, before the Hunger catches up to them both.</i></p>

<p></p>
<h4>Formats</h4>
<p>Hunger will also be available in eBook format, both for Kindle and other devices.<br/>Hunger will be available as a 5.25"" X 8"" Trade paperback and will be 330 pages.  <br/>Finally,
 Hunger will be available as a 6"" X 9"" hardcover with cloth binding and a
 dust jacket.  It will be about 350 pages.  What is special about 
the hardcover edition is it will feature a ten page ""Sketchbook"" with exclusive drawings I have done in my own sketchbook of the characters, certain scenes, and maps of the area.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Design</h4>
<p>From cover to the last page I have meticulously designed this book according to all the current book design guidelines. It is an easy read and is everything you would expect to see from a ""big name"" publisher. <br/></p>
<h3>What I Need, and What You'll Get</h3>
<p>I now need to cover the costs of copyrighting, formatting costs, misc. publishing fees, and I want to get a few more copies of the paperback and hardcover to sell on my website and at the shows that I do. I figure it will cost around $3,000 to cover all of that.<br/></p>
<p>I will be officially launching this book on all platforms on June 21, 2016. I am considering this campaign to be the pre-pre-orders, which means everyone that contributes to this campaign (and of course those who contributed to the original campaign) will get the printed book at least two weeks before the official release date (I am estimating I will get them in by June 8th or so). Also, anyone who contributed to my first campaign for Hunger, and anyone that contributes $8 or over to this campaign will get the eBook for -free-.

<h3>Who I Am:</h3>
<p>I've been in the book business for years. I worked for an independent publisher for five years, doing ad design, contracts, editorial work, and cover layout. I spent 12 years at Barnes &amp; Noble, eight of that in a management position. I currently work in a library.</p>
<p>I've also been writing and self-publishing for the past five years, with enough success that I've had other authors pitch really exciting projects to me that they want me to publish. </p>
<p>I know the book business from just about every angle! </p>
<p>It's been a dream of mine for decades to start my own indie publishing company, and a dream to help other authors realize their dreams as well! The business has been formed - <strong>kOZMIC Press LLC </strong>with two imprints, kOZMIC Kids and kOZMIC Classics -- and I have the experience I need to get it going, but my pockets aren't very deep, and I could use a little help raising some start-up capital! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How YOU Can Help:</h3>
<p>While all the basics have been achieved (business license, new equipment, new software, bank accounts, etc), I could really use some additional funding to help out in these areas:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573193250/uwvzpnryyjwmowbgcmc4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Artwork Commissions </b>- All books need artwork, right? Covers, interior illustrations, etc. One of my upcoming projects is a children's picture book called <i>Lucy Can't Dance</i>, and an illustrator (<strong>Stephanie Jackson</strong>) has already begun work. It's about a shy, awkward little girl who learns to come out of her shell. I'm really excited about this project and can't wait to get it out into the world. Don't let Lucy down! Help her and her friends come to life!  </li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing</strong> - We have to get the word out about out titles! And every new book requires a new marketing strategy. <i>Lucy Can't Dance </i>will need to be marketed to bookstores, schools, libraries, and specialty stores. </li>
<li>
<strong>Other Authors</strong> - Some extra funds will help me get to a position where I can start taking on some of the other exciting projects that I've been pitched, which will help with advances and initial royalties. Plus, new authors writing new books need artwork, so that brings us back to the first point. And their books have to be marketed, so second point! </li>
<li>
<strong>Copy Editing </strong>- I'll need to hire professional proofreaders and copy editors to make sure every book is ready to be published! </li>
<li>
<strong>Accounting </strong>- I need to find someone to help me keep my books in order.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Impact Your Contribution Will Make:</h3>
<p>I firmly believe that art and expression are vital to human happiness and fulfillment. I want to be a part of giving other authors a voice and a stepping stone to bigger successes, and eventually grow my little business into a bigger success itself! </p>

I've been in the book business for years. I worked for an independent publisher for five years, doing ad design, contracts, editorial work, and cover layout. I spent 12 years at Barnes & Noble, eight of that in a management position. I currently work in a library.
I've also been writing and self-publishing for the past five years, with enough success that I've had other authors pitch really exciting projects to me that they want me to publish. 
I know the book business from just about every angle! 
It's been a dream of mine for decades to start my own indie publishing company, and a dream to help other authors realize their dreams as well! The business has been formed - kOZMIC Press LLC with two imprints, kOZMIC Kids and kOZMIC Classics -- and I have the experience I need to get it going, but my pockets aren't very deep, and I could use a little help raising some start-up capital! 
 

How YOU Can Help:
While all the basics have been achieved (business license, new equipment, new software, bank accounts, etc), I could really use some additional funding to help out in these areas:



Artwork Commissions - All books need artwork, right? Covers, interior illustrations, etc. One of my upcoming projects is a children's picture book called Lucy Can't Dance, and an illustrator (Stephanie Jackson) has already begun work. It's about a shy, awkward little girl who learns to come out of her shell. I'm really excited about this project and can't wait to get it out into the world. Don't let Lucy down! Help her and her friends come to life!  

Marketing - We have to get the word out about out titles! And every new book requires a new marketing strategy. Lucy Can't Dance will need to be marketed to bookstores, schools, libraries, and specialty stores. 

Other Authors - Some extra funds will help me get to a position where I can start taking on some of the other exciting projects that I've been pitched, which will help with advances and initial royalties. Plus, new authors writing new books need artwork, so that brings us back to the first point. And their books have to be marketed, so second point! 

Copy Editing - I'll need to hire professional proofreaders and copy editors to make sure every book is ready to be published! 

Accounting - I need to find someone to help me keep my books in order.

 

What Impact Your Contribution Will Make:
I firmly believe that art and expression are vital to human happiness and fulfillment. I want to be a part of giving other authors a voice and a stepping stone to bigger successes, and eventually grow my little business into a bigger success itself!

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>Be A Learn-It-All</i> is a book that explores the growth mindset and different strategies for lifelong learning .<br/><br/>My name is Jen Vermet, and I am the author of <i>Be a Learn-it-all</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to inspire and encourage others to not give up their curiosity of learning new things after formal education ends. I want others to take the reins of their learning through being exposed to what other options are available.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover inspiring stories and research for the unlimited potential you can unleash during the longevity of your life. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for lifelong learning in you. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you reach your educational goals through developing a strategy and tapping into your curiosity to ultimately be a lifelong learner within all aspects of your life.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about up-skilling and experimentation:<ul>
<li>My personal journey of discovering how to learn differently through shifting my mindset</li>
<li>An account of different mental tools and modes of learning through a better understanding of our brain</li>
<li>Inspiring stories of other’s learning journeys from applying what they discover to their life</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in optimizing your learning or looking to be inspired about different ways on your journey to learn through reframing your mindset and become a self-directed learner, a Learn-it-all. <br/><br/><i>Be A Learn-It-All</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to young adults and business professionals who are looking to explore different learning options to take advantage of. I want to see this book being used as a proactive tool to encourage learning over the longevity of a lifetime. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book -<i> Be a Learn-it-all</i>
</h2>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction and Chapters 1-5. In the introduction, I share how I faced a blind spot with an incorrect perception of myself, and how I started my own learning journey to develop my weaknesses. The science of learning, history of education, and defining what a “Learn-it-all” is will be described as well.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters 6-10. These are based on different strategies readers can experiment with. They will learn about self-education, self-awareness, self-assessment, and experiential learning. The reader can discover starting points where they can start their own learning journey as I did with taking different assessments, creating mindful habits, exploring different mediums, signing up for courses, and finding inspiring communities.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains Chapters 10-15. This part of the book will look to the future with a glimpse of the knowledge industry and how companies are looking for Learn-it-all attributes to hire. It will showcase how educating yourself is crucial for the future in this volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world. The time relevance of skillsets keeps shrinking. The linear life path will no longer be the status quo in the future, instead there will be multiple stages.<br/> </p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in October 2019</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this Fall 2019</li>
</ul> When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish</li>
<li>A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</li>
<li>Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)</li>
<li>Early access to the Introduction of my Book and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback</li>
<li>The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover</li>
<li>I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my book</li>
<li>And more...</li>
</ul>
<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p><br/>Jen Vermet is a student of life. She is a young professional who graduated from Miami University with a Bachelor of Science in Finance and a minor in Management and Leadership. She is an advisory analyst in leadership development within Korn Ferry in Chicago, Illinois. In December 2018, Jen became a leadership graduate from the Dale Carnegie course and is an active member of Toastmaster’s International.<br/><br/>Jen wrote this book because she strives to keep challenging herself to continue learning. She became aware of her fixed mindset after reading Carol Dweck’s book <i>Mindset The New Psychology of Success</i>. She now strives to maintain a growth mindset. Jen wanted to pass on what she learned to others for their own benefit of self-growth.<br/><br/>Adventure and traveling abroad are some of the learning experiences Jen loves most while being immersed in a foreign culture.

<h3>Why Fables?</h3>
<p>Not only are fables part of public school curriculum, but they have been a benchmark of didactic literature for thousands of years. The reasons are obvious. Tell a child a proverb and he or she may ignore you. But tell it through the mouth of a lion or a dragon or a cute little field mouse and all of a sudden you have a listening ear!  </p>
<p>After publishing six children's books over the course of three years, I have become convinced that while teaching children to love reading is a good thing, teaching them to love others is better. And I've discovered that fables can help in that endeavor. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book and the Mission (what you get)</h3>
<p>There are hundreds of campaigns, charitable organizations, and products you can support financially. There are also hundreds of books you can buy<i> right now</i> in a store. But here's why I think you'll benefit from partnering with me:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>Big Cat Spat</i> blends the old-school comic wit of Dr. Seuss and Bugs Bunny with the sharp proverbial wisdom of Aesop and Solomon. In other words, you'll be pre-ordering a bookstore quality hardcover book that will make your kids and grandkids laugh hysterically while also teaching them a valuable lesson about pride and the need to accept others.</li>
<li>Furthermore, when you pre-order the book, you'll also be giving to charity in the process. 15% of all funds go directly to helping feed, clothe and educate orphaned children throughout the world and I'm privileged to partner with Carol Adams and her Non-Government Organization called Y.E.S. Uganda. Carol raises and serves orphaned children there in Uganda, so visit her website at <a href=""http://www.caroladamsministry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.caroladamsministry.com</a> to learn about the wonderful work she and her team are doing there in Africa.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why $3,000?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Writing, illustrating, and publishing bookstore quality children's books is an expensive endeavor and one that has placed me in debt over the past two years.</li>
<li>Illustrations for a 40-50 page book cost around $1,500 (and that is actually an inexpensive price compared to most professional artists). For this book, the illustrations are already paid off.</li>
<li>The Chinese printing press I use (that prints for hundreds of publishers and thousands of authors) uses standard ""press printing"" which is the highest quality. However, it also means that the minimum amount of books I can print is 250. To print that few, the price per book is high and leaves me no room for profit. In fact, when factoring in the cost of illustrations, shipping, and time spent, I actually lose money. Thus, it is only ever reasonable for me to buy between 500-1000 books, because the cost per book drops significantly. To print 500 books will cost me a little over $3,000. </li>
<li>Ultimately, I would love to be able to order a thousand copies of <i>The Big Cat Spat</i>. As with my last two books, that would give me the ability to donate 100-200 books to various schools throughout North Carolina. I'll also be able to donate books to hospitals, day care centers, and literacy programs across the US. </li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, thank you for your interest in my stories! Thank you for your pre-order and partnership. Stories, like seeds, don't get very far unless they are spread by others.</p>
<p>God bless,</p>
<p>J.S. Davey</p>

The Book and the Mission (what you get)
There are hundreds of campaigns, charitable organizations, and products you can support financially. There are also hundreds of books you can buy right now in a store. But here's why I think you'll benefit from partnering with me:

The Big Cat Spat blends the old-school comic wit of Dr. Seuss and Bugs Bunny with the sharp proverbial wisdom of Aesop and Solomon. In other words, you'll be pre-ordering a bookstore quality hardcover book that will make your kids and grandkids laugh hysterically while also teaching them a valuable lesson about pride and the need to accept others.
Furthermore, when you pre-order the book, you'll also be giving to charity in the process. 15% of all funds go directly to helping feed, clothe and educate orphaned children throughout the world and I'm privileged to partner with Carol Adams and her Non-Government Organization called Y.E.S. Uganda. Carol raises and serves orphaned children there in Uganda, so visit her website at www.caroladamsministry.com to learn about the wonderful work she and her team are doing there in Africa.


 
Why $3,000?

Writing, illustrating, and publishing bookstore quality children's books is an expensive endeavor and one that has placed me in debt over the past two years.
Illustrations for a 40-50 page book cost around $1,500 (and that is actually an inexpensive price compared to most professional artists). For this book, the illustrations are already paid off.
The Chinese printing press I use (that prints for hundreds of publishers and thousands of authors) uses standard ""press printing"" which is the highest quality. However, it also means that the minimum amount of books I can print is 250. To print that few, the price per book is high and leaves me no room for profit. In fact, when factoring in the cost of illustrations, shipping, and time spent, I actually lose money. Thus, it is only ever reasonable for me to buy between 500-1000 books, because the cost per book drops significantly. To print 500 books will cost me a little over $3,000. 
Ultimately, I would love to be able to order a thousand copies of The Big Cat Spat. As with my last two books, that would give me the ability to donate 100-200 books to various schools throughout North Carolina. I'll also be able to donate books to hospitals, day care centers, and literacy programs across the US. 

All in all, thank you for your interest in my stories! Thank you for your pre-order and partnership. Stories, like seeds, don't get very far unless they are spread by others.
God bless,
J.S. Davey

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>I write science fiction and fantasy.<br/>
</h3> <p>We've all got this same old world around us. Steel and asphalt, stucco and concrete, bright buzzing lights and greyed-out night sky. Wood and tin, dust and mud, acrid fumes and palpitating sun. Slender ash trees in cool mountain hollows. Olive groves on dusky Mediterranean slopes.</p>
<p>The alchemy of storytelling takes that familiar stuff and transforms it into fantastic new worlds, which become just as much a part of us. The wild things and their wild rumpus. A magic door in a wardrobe. Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which. Amber, Nessus, Middle Earth. The claustrophobic corridors of a dying battlestar.<br/>
</p>
<p> I want to make more of those worlds. And this summer, I have a very special chance to make six of them!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431465250/kaal0gcbscj0jeuhg2wg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I'll be writing six new original stories, as part of a long-running speculative fiction workshop called Clarion West. Every year, 18 writers from around the world meet in Seattle for an intensive workshop experience. Not only do we get to work with each other's input and feedback, but we also get six amazing mentors from the sci-fi writing community to help us hone our storytelling.</p>
<p>Mentors this year include Connie Willis and Cory Doctorow. Mentors in recent years have included George R. R. Martin, Joe Hill, and Neil Gaiman.</p>
<p>For a young writer, Clarion is pretty exciting. And this year, I got in! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>But I could really use your help.<br/>
</h3> <p>I'm a freelance writer and editor. That means I don't get paid for hours when I don't work. And for almost two months this summer, I won't be able to take freelance contracts at all. <br/></p>
<p>So I'll have two months of no money coming in, but there will still be pesky bills to pay. For example:<br/></p> <ul> <li>$350 for two months of health insurance. I'll need that, in case I write so hard I break my arm. <br/>
</li> <li>$425 in travel expenses: flights, trains to and from the airport, etc. <br/>
</li> <li>$145 to keep my phone working for two months. (This means I can send you fun pictures of Seattle, yay!!)</li>
<li>$200 for food and other necessities. Clarion provides some meals, but not all.<br/>
</li>
<li>$900 to cover rent and utilities on my charming attic room while I'm away, so I still have a place to live when I get back.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <p>If you felt like doing math, you might have noticed that those costs already add up to more than the amount I'm asking for. And that's not even counting the expenses of creating the perks, shipping the perks to you, paying the IndieGoGo and credit card processing fees, etc. <br/></p>
<p>I'm hoping this campaign will raise a fair bit more than my goal, so I can write my six stories with a clear, unworried mind this summer. (The more I can immerse myself in what I'm working on, the better the end result!) But even the $1900 would make a huge difference. Seriously. So much.</p>
<p> <br/></p>
<h3>Perks!<br/>
</h3>
<p>One of the backer perks I'm offering is these Muji notebooks, screen-printed by hand, with the following designs by artist <a href=""michaelnorcross.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michael Norcross</a>:</p>
<p>1. Music Makers<br/></p>
<p></p>

<p>2. The Royal Library of Meret (long ago and far away, there was a city on a hill, and at the crown of the hill was the library...)<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432820285/iyvh4oer79ii0ri0iqxj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>3. Dreamscape: The Desert of Pento (This is from the same world as the library -- it's still cooking, and not quite ready to be served yet. So consider this a sneak preview! :-)<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432820294/hce4vuceeouopaaav4lk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>Other backer rewards will include needle-felted critters like this handsome fellow!</p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> I already got into Clarion and decided to go, so this thing is happening! Minimal risk to you! It's real and legit! You can see my name on <a href=""http://www.clarionwest.org/2015/03/23/introducing-the-clarion-west-class-of-2015/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this year's class list</a>!<br/></p>
<p>Of course I can't guarantee the exact path of my writing career. No one can do that. I might have a bestseller out next year, I might toil in obscurity for decades before finally coming out with something totally genius, or maybe I'll only ever publish short stories that circulate among a small crowd of dedicated speculative fiction fans. But I can tell you this: I'm as stubborn as they come. And I'm never, ever going to stop writing.<br/></p>
<p>By the way, if you want to check out a few things I've written recently, <a href=""http://christineneulieb.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">you can do that here</a>!</p>
<p>I'll do my best to get all campaign perks shipped before I leave (the workshop starts June 21). But if an overwhelming wave of generosity comes my way and there are zillions of packages to get ready, I may have to ship some of them in August when I get back.</p>
<p>I know you'll be waiting with bated breath.</p>
<p>If you've read this far, you're my hero. <br/></p>

 We've all got this same old world around us. Steel and asphalt, stucco and concrete, bright buzzing lights and greyed-out night sky. Wood and tin, dust and mud, acrid fumes and palpitating sun. Slender ash trees in cool mountain hollows. Olive groves on dusky Mediterranean slopes.
The alchemy of storytelling takes that familiar stuff and transforms it into fantastic new worlds, which become just as much a part of us. The wild things and their wild rumpus. A magic door in a wardrobe. Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which. Amber, Nessus, Middle Earth. The claustrophobic corridors of a dying battlestar.

 I want to make more of those worlds. And this summer, I have a very special chance to make six of them!


I'll be writing six new original stories, as part of a long-running speculative fiction workshop called Clarion West. Every year, 18 writers from around the world meet in Seattle for an intensive workshop experience. Not only do we get to work with each other's input and feedback, but we also get six amazing mentors from the sci-fi writing community to help us hone our storytelling.
Mentors this year include Connie Willis and Cory Doctorow. Mentors in recent years have included George R. R. Martin, Joe Hill, and Neil Gaiman.
For a young writer, Clarion is pretty exciting. And this year, I got in! 


  But I could really use your help.
 I'm a freelance writer and editor. That means I don't get paid for hours when I don't work. And for almost two months this summer, I won't be able to take freelance contracts at all. 
So I'll have two months of no money coming in, but there will still be pesky bills to pay. For example:  $350 for two months of health insurance. I'll need that, in case I write so hard I break my arm. 
 $425 in travel expenses: flights, trains to and from the airport, etc. 
 $145 to keep my phone working for two months. (This means I can send you fun pictures of Seattle, yay!!)
$200 for food and other necessities. Clarion provides some meals, but not all.

$900 to cover rent and utilities on my charming attic room while I'm away, so I still have a place to live when I get back.
    If you felt like doing math, you might have noticed that those costs already add up to more than the amount I'm asking for. And that's not even counting the expenses of creating the perks, shipping the perks to you, paying the IndieGoGo and credit card processing fees, etc. 
I'm hoping this campaign will raise a fair bit more than my goal, so I can write my six stories with a clear, unworried mind this summer. (The more I can immerse myself in what I'm working on, the better the end result!) But even the $1900 would make a huge difference. Seriously. So much.
 
Perks!

One of the backer perks I'm offering is these Muji notebooks, screen-printed by hand, with the following designs by artist Michael Norcross:
1. Music Makers


2. The Royal Library of Meret (long ago and far away, there was a city on a hill, and at the crown of the hill was the library...)
3. Dreamscape: The Desert of Pento (This is from the same world as the library -- it's still cooking, and not quite ready to be served yet. So consider this a sneak preview! :-)

Other backer rewards will include needle-felted critters like this handsome fellow!





  Risks & Challenges  I already got into Clarion and decided to go, so this thing is happening! Minimal risk to you! It's real and legit! You can see my name on this year's class list!
Of course I can't guarantee the exact path of my writing career. No one can do that. I might have a bestseller out next year, I might toil in obscurity for decades before finally coming out with something totally genius, or maybe I'll only ever publish short stories that circulate among a small crowd of dedicated speculative fiction fans. But I can tell you this: I'm as stubborn as they come. And I'm never, ever going to stop writing.
By the way, if you want to check out a few things I've written recently, you can do that here!
I'll do my best to get all campaign perks shipped before I leave (the workshop starts June 21). But if an overwhelming wave of generosity comes my way and there are zillions of packages to get ready, I may have to ship some of them in August when I get back.
I know you'll be waiting with bated breath.
If you've read this far, you're my hero. 
THANKS.

<h3>Short Summary of Me...</h3>
<p>I'm a sole parent and mother of 3 awesome kids. My first book was published in May 2010 and the second in November 2011.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.debislinger.com/?s=poppy+pretzel+"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Poppy Pretzel</a> - Passage Into Puberty, published by New Holland Publishing</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.debislinger.com/levi-sprocket-pocket/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Levi Sprocket</a> - what's in my pocket?, self published.</p>
<p>Levi Sprocket recently won a Bronze Medal at the prestigious Readers Favorite Awards in the U.S.A. in the category of Health/Wellbeing this year. Yeehah!</p>
<p>My books are called documentary fiction by many because I weave 'real life' situations into a story. For example, Poppy Pretzel is about a young girl who gets her first period at school but the underlying story is about friendships, self confidence and emotional connection. Unlike many books for kids this age, I add depth to the characters by revealing their emotions, how vulnerable they feel and how they get through their everyday lives.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about working with young people and one of my jobs has been as an Integration Aide, where I work 1:1 with kids that have special needs, so I'm in touch at a grass roots level how being a little 'different' can affect your life.</p>
<p>How do I know about allergies? Who doesn't these days! WIth 1 in 10 kids having an allergy, we are all interconnected somewhere with someone who has an allergy or intolerance to something. In particular though, my kids and I co-shared a house for some time with a dear friend, Suzanna who has two young children with allergies. Since that time, I've gained empathy about what it's like for a child to live day-to-day with an allergy and have seen first hand how others react when faced with a child who doesn't quite fit into 'norm'. Suzanna is in fact an author herself of the well known book <a href=""http://www.allergysafe.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Allergy Safe Family Food</a></p>
<p>This book will be between 10-12,000 words. Once Stella Cooke is written I will be continuing on with a series of other books for kids for ages 8+ on issues of health and wellbeing in the same format as Stella Cooke. The other topics that are drafted but not set in stone are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asthma </li>
<li>Diabetes</li>
<li>Autism</li>
<li>Sadness</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have ideas or suggestions of topics you think would be worthwhile covered, let me know. I love to hear what's on people's minds.</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking for funding that will allow me to have the books professionally edited and a book cover designed. These books will be made into eBooks first and then into hardcover books.</p>
<p>If you decide to contribute, here is where your money will be going:</p>
<p><strong>EDITING</strong>: I have a fabulous editor in the USA who does great work for me and in fact, edited my second book, Levi Sprocket. I'm able to do a good proof read but his touches make it magical and also readable for anyone, no matter what country they live in. So the first part of the funds will be going to the editing.</p>
<p><strong>COVER ARTWORK</strong>: A dear friend Elke from <a href=""http://www.curlewcreative.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Curlew Creative</a> did the artwork for my second book Levi Sprocket and I'd like her clever artistry to create the cover for Stella too. This would be probably a larger cost than the editing but a cover can 'make or break a book'. There will also be some small line drawings inside the book which I'll have Elke do as well so a contribution will go towards her artwork here too.</p>
<p><strong>FORMATTING:</strong> Stella Cooke will be made into an eBook on Smashwords, Kindle and other reading devices. Once edited, the manuscript needs to be formatted to suit these mediums.</p>
<p><strong>TYPSETTING:</strong> If I'm fortunate enough to have generous contributors, the book will go into print and yeehah for you guys, because that means if you've donated $20 or more, you get a copy of the book. Part of the cost will go to having the book typeset, which is a fiddly job but my typesetter is efficient and detail oriented.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Perks For You</strong>:</h3>
<p>Depending on how much you contribute will depend on what I'm able to supply you with your reward.</p>
<p>Every contributor will receive something for their generosity, even if only my undying respect, gratitude and good karma thoughts. </p>
<p>Levels start with personal email of thank you and appreciation up to 3 copies of ALL my books + PDF's and book marks.</p>
<p>If I don't reach the entire goal, then the funds will be put towards the book going to eBook first.</p>
<p>If enough funds are raised, my goal is for every school library to have access to a copy - whether digitally or hard copy. Yeh, I know it's a big goal but why not reach for the stars. </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></h3>
<div>I understand that you may not be able to contribute money but if you'd still like to help, here are a few ways you can:</div>
<p><strong>SHARE ON FACEBOOK/TWITTER</strong>: Share this campaign on facebook, twitter, or whichever social media site you frequent. Do you have friends who have allergies? Do you know of someone that could benefit from this book? Share it with them! You can also help by retweeting my Stella Cooke posts on:</p>

<p>But Melifax and his sect, the dour Browns, are determined to bring the people of Devien into a new age, an age of moralism, conformity and mass production, ensuring that the beauty and pageantry of Devien and its Devices will be lost forever.</p>
<h3>What's this campaign about?</h3>
<p><em>Songs for a Machine Age</em> is a fantasy novel written by a Maker who believes in people making things.  It's an unusual blend: a Dumas-esque adventure that celebrates the making of beautiful things, thoroughly influenced by the author's fascination with clockwork, magic, and history.</p>
<p>Heather McDougal grew up at a summer craft school, has worked in the garment industry, and has an MFA in sculpture, and is now deeply involved in the Maker movement. She is the creator of the fascinating blog <a href=""http://cabinet-of-wonders.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cabinet of Wonders</a>, a compendium of wonderful objects, thoughts, and ideas.</p>
<p>Her new novel, Songs for a Machine Age, is coming out from Hadley Rille Books and Heather is trying to collect enough money to put 100-150 free copies into the book bags given to the participants of the World Fantasy Conference at the beginning of November, just when the book is coming out, thus inspiring other authors, publishers, agents and reviewers to read and talk about the book.</p>

<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>If I can earn $1000, I can cover the cost of the free books, the fees, and the books I give away here.</p>

<li>With the fees for Indiegogo and prizes here, that figure comes closer to $900.</li>
<li>My goal is to send as many books as I can to the conference at the end of October.</li>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>A donation of $10 will get you a postcard with a URL for a free copy of the eBook</li>
<li>$25 will get you a signed copy of the physical book (in trade paperback format)</li>

<h3>Why should you help?</h3>

<h3>What Kurdish Matters is all about</h3>
<p>Do you ever hear them? The stories of Kurds, sharing their hopes in life, their sorrows, their choices, dreams, pains? Probably, you never do. Because the stories that are usually in the media about Kurds in Turkey, are about violence. <br/><br/>Violence is part of the Kurdish problem, but not the root of it. The root is that people's human rights are being denied. With Kurdish Matters, I want to tell the story of the Kurdish issue through the eyes of average Kurds. Villagers and city dwellers, students, workers, housewives, activists, mothers, fathers, children. Their lives tell the true story of the Kurdish issue in Turkey. <br/><br/>I am a very experienced freelance journalist (more than 20 years experience!), originally from the Netherlands. I have been based in Turkey since 2006. Earlier this year, I moved to Diyarbakir, the biggest city in the predominantly Kurdish Southeast of Turkey. When I hear the stories of the people here, there is only one thing I want to do: share them. <br/><br/>I hope my project will increase the awareness of the situation of Kurds in Turkey. Maybe, maybe, it can even slighty contribute to solving the issue by creating more understanding.</p>
<p>Writing this book, requires money. I need money to travel, to pay translators, and to create time - every minute I work on this book, I can not earn my daily living. Time is money. Besides the book, that will be published in both English and Dutch, Kurdish Matters also involves a website: <a href=""http://www.kurdishmatters.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kurdishmatters.com</a>. On that site, I blog about the book process and about what I learn investigating the Kurdish issue. I do that in three languages: English, Turkish and Kurdish. <br/><br/>The budget of the whole project is some €40,000. While this campaign on Indiegogo is running, I also run a crowdfunding campaign on a Dutch site. Both of them together will hopefully fund half of the project. The rest comes from a journalism fund in the Netherlands, and from my own modest savings. </p>

<p>I’m
Andrea, an educator and the mother of a 13 year old girl who is the illustrator
of this brand new book celebrating periods.<br/></p>
<p>My
Moon is a period book for girls and young women. It is an earthy celebration of
our nature seeing our period as a gift. The book includes a positive look at body
beauty as the perfection of nature and periods as the end of an amazing
reproductive story. Complete with colour illustrations. <br/></p><p></p><p>I’ve
been educating women and girls since I was 16 years old and have worked with
dedication to educate myself and daughter on a journey into womanhood. There is so much to share.<br/></p>
<p>If
you help me finish and print this book I will be able to take my stories to as
many girls as I can meet and leave one free copy in each public library and
school library I visit. With your help, I will help many, many more people.</p>
<p>We
can raise a generation of girls together.</p>

The bigger goal of this project in the future is to educate girls about the magic and beauty of their bodies and send a free copy to each school across Canada. Into the hands of many.
About Me and My Moon
I’m
Andrea, an educator and the mother of a 13 year old girl who is the illustrator
of this brand new book celebrating periods.
My
Moon is a period book for girls and young women. It is an earthy celebration of
our nature seeing our period as a gift. The book includes a positive look at body
beauty as the perfection of nature and periods as the end of an amazing
reproductive story. Complete with colour illustrations. I’ve
been educating women and girls since I was 16 years old and have worked with
dedication to educate myself and daughter on a journey into womanhood. There is so much to share.
If
you help me finish and print this book I will be able to take my stories to as
many girls as I can meet and leave one free copy in each public library and
school library I visit. With your help, I will help many, many more people.
We
can raise a generation of girls together.
""Never
doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world. Indeed, it
is the only thing that ever has.""

The Easter Bunny, the Boogeyman, the Tooth Fairy and even a wet-blanket named Bill are conducting their business from here too, working for a company called Holiday Incorporated, where they are under the thumb and watchful eyes of the omnipresent Corporate Headquarters.

had a funny name and a different appearance. He was never given a chance to

And only a year and a half later there was the greatest gift my parents could give me, my little sis. A few (I mean it when I say a FEW) years passed and now the two girls of the story fight for another story, a sweet children's story about a dinosaur called Bongo...! ""


What do we do?


      
Evi writes…
“I write for fun. I write for those I love. I write for the
things that make me laugh. I write to create smiles. I write for myself. I
write to remember. I write for my little ones. I write to my little ones.
I write to myself. I write to fulfill my dreams. I write to create new ones. I
write because I believe in fairies. I write to make a difference. I write to
believe. I write to you.”

run for those I love. I run to remember. I run to forget. I run to escape. I

What do we need? 
To Bring Bongo to Life we need the minimum amount of 800GBP. 
The writing has been done. (Hooray!!) Big part of a children's book is
the illustration which has been partially done but it needs to
be finalized and may subject to change. 
The money will go 100% towards a Publishing company which will publish
the book, promote and distribute it worldwide through thousand of online
retailers like Amazon and various distribution channels to target bookshops and
special markets while utilizing Print-On-Demand technology.
As it is only baby steps, we will work on an POD agreement which
practically means that the book will be available on order only. 
Anything extra will go towards the illustration and
the promotion of the book. 
If we don't hit our funding goal (cross your legs, bite your tongue,
sing naked in the rain, eat some salt while hopping on one leg and this will
never happen)  we’ll keep moving forward. In this unlikely event we
will have to delay publishing the book for a few weeks and reduce our
promotional activities until we reach our funding goal and proceed.
Children books have a higher publishing cost than any other book due to
the high number of images and the full color printing but that is
something we could not compromise as illustrations play a vital role. 
To run that campaign, we will literally run it to the full. Maria on
Saturday, 9th of November flies all the way from London to Athens to
run the Classic Marathon a day later. Oh yes! 42.195 klms (in British words 26 miles and
385 yards); first time

If it was to measure Maria’s faith to Bongo in klm’s that would have been a
Marathon route! That kept her running early mornings, late evenings, lazy wannabe
Sundays throughout the year. 
Your love and support is her drug to the race and there is not a single
anti-doping test in the world to detect that!

Precarious Future</a>. </i>Can you help us keep our ebook free?</p>
<p><i>Resist!</i> is the third book in the <i>Radical
Future</i> series: publications written and edited by young* activists,
journalists and artists calling for radical alternatives to the status quo. We're interested in social justice, liberation and collectivity, and the ways young people are organising to create change. If you think mainstream politics is a dismal failure and you still have hope we can do better, this book is for you. </p>
<p>The first book in the series, <i><a href=""http://www.lwbooks.co.uk/ebooks/radicalfuture.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Radical Future:
Politics for the next generation</a></i>, was written before the 2010 election (remember back when things were bad, but we had no idea how much worse they were going to get?). The follow
up, <i><a href=""http://www.lwbooks.co.uk/ebooks/Regeneration.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Regeneration</a></i>,
was published in 2012, and received over 50,000 downloads.</p>
<p><i>Resist!</i> includes chapters about youth activist
movements, re-envisioning work, feminist economics, direct action against the
housing crisis, alternative media and organising after the London riots, from
contributors like feminist campaigner <a href=""http://pollytrenow.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Polly
Trenow</a>, activist <a href=""http://isthisday.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wail Qasim</a> and
openDemocracy journalist <a href=""https://www.opendemocracy.net/author/adam-ramsay"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adam Ramsay</a>. It is edited by journalist and openDemocracy editor <a href=""www.rayfilar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ray Filar</a>.</p>
<p>We’re really excited about this next book and can’t wait to
get it published. </p>
<p>But to get there, we need your help.</p>
<p>Like the first two books in the series, we want to make <i>Resist!</i> as
accessible as possible by also offering it as a free ebook (as well as a paperback version). But ironically,
publishing a free ebook is expensive. The publisher, Lawrence &amp; Wishart, is
covering most of the costs, but we need
help with the final £2000. And we need it sharpish to get it out before the
general election. So that’s why we’re asking you to donate. Your money will go towards typesetting, copy editing, proofing, and promotion.</p>
<p>We’ve put together some amazing rewards. As well as
beautiful merchandise designed by our talented cover artist <a href=""http://www.yoavsegal.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yoav Segal</a>, we’re
harnessing the talents, pub-debating skills and canal boats of our
contributors. We're offering prints that you can put on your wall, and tote bags with our cover art on. You’ll also find a great selection of workshops, excursions and

<p><strong>Why We Are Writing this Book</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Andy’s “Why”</em></strong></p>
<p>My ex-wife and I are friends. Our kids are whole. Our divorce cost us about $300. We still share the same mutual friends. My parents still treat her as their daughter. Based on what I see out in the world, we are unusual. We are the exception. But does it really have to be that way? Unfortunately, both of us have many friends, colleagues and acquaintances who are suffering through the divorce process. My ex-wife and I are often asked, “How did you do it? How did you guys have such a ‘good’ divorce? What was your secret?” The purpose of this book is to answer these questions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Becky’s “Why”</em></strong></p>
<p>Unlike Andy, I grew up around some very painful divorces. The kind of divorce where kids are evicted from their homes two days before Christmas, because some judge decided he wanted to give the house to the “other spouse.” The kind of divorce where ex-spouses stopped talking to one another and have never talked to one another again, despite 20 years of history and kids in the picture.  I didn’t believe there could be a better “model” for divorcing. Yet, I had hope. I was and still am passionate that a better way could be found. Then one day I became a divorce mediator. People ask me all of the time: “Is it really possible to have a ‘friendly’ divorce?” Just as Andy acknowledged above, many people are surprised that there is such a thing as a “good” divorce.</p>
<p><strong><em>Call to Action</em></strong></p>
<p>So we wanted to write this book to reveal the secrets of the “good divorce"" as a real possibility for couples – an alternative to fighting, bickering over who gets the end table, and abusing their kids over who loves them more.</p>
<p>The money that we raise on Indiegogo will be used for 3 purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>To help pay for the initial publishing cost<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>To help pay for initial marketing of the book<br/><br/>

<li>To fund the creation of a website where we can collect and share stories, information, and advice about what works and doesn't work in creating a good divorce. We will be asking all of you for your recommendations on lawyers, mediators, and counselors who support the ""Good Divorce"" process. The website will provide a place where you can find out what resources are available in your local area.</li>

<p>
</p><p>Hi, my name is Alice Eckles and I need your help to publish my upcoming novel. <i>The Literature Preferred By Wild Boar: An Optimistic Story About The Future</i> is a humor filled post-apocalyptic novel about an environmental disaster that leaves humanity scrambling for new ways to live. Think JK Rowling meets George Orwell.  </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p>
<p>In 2056 the world's population is down to a few thousands after The Great Wobble, a catastrophic weather event. Deb a middle aged woman rebuilding her life and suffering from the loss of her career creates a project for herself. She is going to seek out a story that will help humanity survive. To do this she researches her grandfather's life crisis, and how he came through it. Her interest seems to draw lost family members out of the woodwork. </p><p>The trouble starts when a wild boar befriends her. Deb's neighbors-who have had their prestigious plants uprooted-  think the boar is her responsibility. They demand the Deb kill the boar, or else it's war. This neighbor, Alfred, is a French diplomat of sorts. Deb is an intuitive, nature loving person and doesn't want to kill the boar. Eventually she does decide to hunt the wild boar, under pressure from her husband, Charles, but also out of curiosity about hunting and this new hunger for meat that has come over the community. Eating meat had fallen into disrepute, but ever since Alfred's wife became pregnant the taboo seemed ready to break. </p><p>As Deb hunts the boar she is led into a spiritual world seemingly annexed off the everyday landscape. After she kills the boar undigested letters are discovered in his intestines that help Deb with her story and unite the community. The feast of wild boar also has the transformative effect of giving everyone a boost of warmth and self-knowledge. Deb's family as well as the human family are brought together.</p><p><b><a href=""http://www.alice-eckles.com/resources/Wild_Boar_sample_Eckles.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">READ A SAMPLE CHAPTER</a></b></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><b>Six Reasons to Eat Local</b></p>
<ul id=""yui_3_7_2_44_1374458881959_68"">
<li><span id=""yui_3_7_2_44_1374458881959_60"">Personal Health--food grown organically near where you live has more nutrients, and tastes better than factory food.</span></li>
<li id=""yui_3_7_2_44_1374458881959_67"">
<span id=""yui_3_7_2_44_1374458881959_65"">The Health of the Earth--local food requires much less in the way of </span><span>chemical and petroleum inputs. If you care about climate change, pollinators, and the environment in general than local food is the way to go.</span>
</li>
<li id=""yui_3_7_2_44_1374458881959_67""><span id=""yui_3_7_2_44_1374458881959_71"">Defeat Monsanto--It is the only way the average person can help defeat the plans of corporations like Monsanto. Seed saving, gardening, and buying local organic food is voting against Big Ag with your dollars. </span></li>
<li id=""yui_3_7_2_44_1374458881959_67""><span id=""yui_3_7_2_44_1374458881959_76"">Builds Strong Local Communities--sharing in the growing and gathering of food is the oldest shared human activity. When people come together in the garden it grows deep ties with each other along with the produce. </span></li>
<li id=""yui_3_7_2_44_1374458881959_67""><span id=""yui_3_7_2_44_1374458881959_79"">Food Security--The only way to protect our food supply is to control it ourselves by growing it ourselves. There are some very large private entities that would like to take that right away from us. We can't allow this to happen. Growing food is growing freedom.</span></li>
<li id=""yui_3_7_2_44_1374458881959_67""><span id=""yui_3_7_2_44_1374458881959_81"">Eating Local is Good for the Spirit-- anyone who has put their hands in the sweet earth will understand what I mean by this.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><b>About the book:</b></span></p>
<p><span id=""yui_3_7_2_44_1374458881959_99"">I am writing this book so that every person in America can enjoy these benefits. Factory food is ""easy"". If you have enough money you just go to the store and buy it--maybe already cooked, or at least neatly packaged. Finding and obtaining the fresh and healthy local foods can be a lot harder. Impossible in some places, but never easy. Local food can also be expensive, which shuts out the poor and struggling middle class from the health and social benefits of eating local.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span id=""yui_3_7_2_44_1374458881959_106"">This book will help you find local food where you live, and discuss ways of making it more accessible. </span></p>
<p>In order to complete this work it is my intention to physically visit and research local food system in every state and region in the country. Anyone can do Internet research on this subject, but to write a book like this it is necessary to observe conditions ""on the ground"". </p>
<p>Here is a draft list of chapters:</p>
<p id=""yui_3_7_2_94_1374183566486_39"">What is Factory Food, What is REAL food?</p>
<p id=""yui_3_7_2_94_1374183566486_39"">Why Don't More People Buy Local Food? The Obstacles that Keep Us on Factory Food</p>
<p id=""yui_3_7_2_94_1374183566486_39"">The Elements of a Local Food System: CSAs, Farmer's Markets, Community Gardens, Home Food Gardens, Gleaning, Casual Barter, Organic Food Hubs, Local Markets, Artisanal Manufacture, and Home Manufacture</p>
<p id=""yui_3_7_2_94_1374183566486_39"">Affordability--How Can we Attain Food Justice and How Can the Poor and Struggling Middle Class Eat Real Local Food?</p>
<p id=""yui_3_7_2_94_1374183566486_39"">Animal Husbandry</p>
<p id=""yui_3_7_2_94_1374183566486_39"">At Home Manufacture: Bread, Ferments, Canning, Drying</p>
<p id=""yui_3_7_2_94_1374183566486_39"">A 50 State (Plus DC) Guide to Local Food with an appendix listing contact information for all sources</p>
<p>About the author:</p>
<p id=""yui_3_7_2_110_1374183566486_63"">My name is Annabel Ascher and I am both a writer and a food activist. I have two main blogs, The Frugal Goddess and The Scratch cook. In recent years I have become more and more concerned about the factory food supply and what it does to damage our planet and our health. As a cook I longed for good real foods to produce amazing meals. I decided to get off ""factory"" foods, and joined a community supported farm. There were challenges I never dreamed of, even in a place that is known as ""real food heaven."" I began to wonder how hard it would be in other places not so blessed, and then I decided to find out for myself, and share that information in the form of a guidebook.</p>

Six Reasons to Eat Local

Personal Health--food grown organically near where you live has more nutrients, and tastes better than factory food.

The Health of the Earth--local food requires much less in the way of chemical and petroleum inputs. If you care about climate change, pollinators, and the environment in general than local food is the way to go.

Defeat Monsanto--It is the only way the average person can help defeat the plans of corporations like Monsanto. Seed saving, gardening, and buying local organic food is voting against Big Ag with your dollars. 
Builds Strong Local Communities--sharing in the growing and gathering of food is the oldest shared human activity. When people come together in the garden it grows deep ties with each other along with the produce. 
Food Security--The only way to protect our food supply is to control it ourselves by growing it ourselves. There are some very large private entities that would like to take that right away from us. We can't allow this to happen. Growing food is growing freedom.
Eating Local is Good for the Spirit-- anyone who has put their hands in the sweet earth will understand what I mean by this.

About the book:
I am writing this book so that every person in America can enjoy these benefits. Factory food is ""easy"". If you have enough money you just go to the store and buy it--maybe already cooked, or at least neatly packaged. Finding and obtaining the fresh and healthy local foods can be a lot harder. Impossible in some places, but never easy. Local food can also be expensive, which shuts out the poor and struggling middle class from the health and social benefits of eating local.

This book will help you find local food where you live, and discuss ways of making it more accessible. 
In order to complete this work it is my intention to physically visit and research local food system in every state and region in the country. Anyone can do Internet research on this subject, but to write a book like this it is necessary to observe conditions ""on the ground"". 
Here is a draft list of chapters:
What is Factory Food, What is REAL food?
Why Don't More People Buy Local Food? The Obstacles that Keep Us on Factory Food
The Elements of a Local Food System: CSAs, Farmer's Markets, Community Gardens, Home Food Gardens, Gleaning, Casual Barter, Organic Food Hubs, Local Markets, Artisanal Manufacture, and Home Manufacture
Affordability--How Can we Attain Food Justice and How Can the Poor and Struggling Middle Class Eat Real Local Food?
Animal Husbandry
At Home Manufacture: Bread, Ferments, Canning, Drying
A 50 State (Plus DC) Guide to Local Food with an appendix listing contact information for all sources
About the author:
My name is Annabel Ascher and I am both a writer and a food activist. I have two main blogs, The Frugal Goddess and The Scratch cook. In recent years I have become more and more concerned about the factory food supply and what it does to damage our planet and our health. As a cook I longed for good real foods to produce amazing meals. I decided to get off ""factory"" foods, and joined a community supported farm. There were challenges I never dreamed of, even in a place that is known as ""real food heaven."" I began to wonder how hard it would be in other places not so blessed, and then I decided to find out for myself, and share that information in the form of a guidebook.



What We Need & What You Get



Needs:
In order to write this book I will need to travel all across the country including Hawaii and Alaska. I will be staying mostly in hostels and taking trains and busses. But tickets will still be required and I will have to buy food and lodging.
The research phase will take one year of travel from 10 to 14 days out of each month, starting in September of 2013.
It is my intention at this time to self-publish, though I would be willing to consider a traditional publishing house if any should offer.
Transportation: $9500
Lodging: $4500
Food while traveling: $3600
Laptop for travel: $1400
Software for mobile writing and production: $1000

Accountability:
I will be doing regular blog posts to update the contributors on the progress of the book, from research to post-production. Check in and follow along as I travel throughout the country.

But that clearly isn't enough. So please look at the goodies in the Perks section! 



The Impact

This guide will help show people in diverse communities how they can get involved in the local food system, or build a local food system where none exists.
This book will be especially important for those people that are struggling financially but still want to feed themselves and their families REAL food. There will be information to help the poor and struggling middle class make truly healthy food choices and get food security.
This guide will help people to feed themselves healthy REAL food and increase the prosperity of their communities.

We estimate this will cost between $4000-5000, so we are well on our way to making this a reality.

And keep reading to learn more about our vision for changing the conversation about birth in our culture...</i></b>
</div><h3><b>1. About the Book</b></h3><p>When <i>Birthing From Within</i> was published 18 years ago, it was hailed as a “landmark in the history of childbirth.” Since that time, Birthing From Within has been a leader in changing the conversation about birth. Some of the ideas Pam England presented that were seen as radical and controversial are now not only accepted and embraced, and have even gone mainstream. Now Pam England is ready to turn the childbirth preparation on its head—again!—with a book that presents the cohesive and evolved vision and model that has been developed and refined over many years of teaching, reflecting, and supporting thousands of parents and birth professionals around the world. This is the <b>Ancient Map for Modern Birth.</b></p><p>Pam has been working on this book (with the helps of Virginia Bobro and many others) for nearly five years: the writing is done, all the illustrations are complete (take a peek at a few of them in the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/new-birth-book-ancient-map-for-modern-birth/x/7887624#/gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gallery</a>), and the final proofreading and book design are underway. Publication date is just around the corner: <b>January 2017</b>. Become a backer of this campaign and you will be first in line to get your hands on this book! You can help make this happen, and we need and value your support!</p><p>Already, the Birthing From Within message has reached hundreds of thousands of families and professionals. Our trainings are in demand around the world, and BFW childbirth classes are offered in 20 countries around the world. There is demonstrated interest our approach to the childbirth preparation and healing. This book is eagerly awaited by those who are already a part of Birthing From Within.</p><p>Every pregnant woman and birth professional will benefit from the compelling blend of current research intertwined with processes and stories that support a woman’s determination, self-respect, and readiness to deal with any type of birth, in any setting (from home to operating room). Our map, inspired by ancient teachings, offer the modern woman a step-by-step guide to understanding her emotional, physical, and psychological journey through the childbearing year. Readers will enjoy in-depth exploration of the story of Inanna, the Laborinth™, as well as practical information, art, rituals and ceremonies, mindfulness practices, and meditations that together provide a rich and stimulating pathway for women to discover personal and collective meaning during the profound rite of passage that is birth. <a href=""http://www.birthingfromwithin.com/blogs/birthing-from-within/52510340-sneak-peek-at-our-new-books-table-of-contents"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Take a peek at the <i>Table of Contents</i> here.</a></p><h3><b>2. Why the book is self-published </b></h3><p>Did you know that <i>Birthing From Within</i> was self-published and is still one of the most successful and beloved childbirth books ever? Despite competing bids from several publishing houses, we decided to self-publish this new book. </p><p>Here’s why: <i>Ancient Map for Modern Birth</i> is not like any other childbirth book out there. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Self-publishing ensures creative control and a collaborative process between authors, artist, and designer. The complex and elegant interior design, including over 140 illustrations, is considerable and requires attention to detail by a skilled designer who really embraces our vision. We are so pleased with the look and feel of this book; what a joy it is to see it come to life in the way we envisioned.</span></p><h3><b>3. Reviews</b></h3><p>""This book reaches far beyond the typical pregnancy and childbirth book. It guides us to find that place inside every human being which connects us to an ancient way of knowing and way of being. When we are connected to that, we cannot get lost. The excitement I felt when reading this book was like embarking on a major journey.  Each chapter was filled with unexpected delights: a story, a remarkable illustration, a new practice. It was like finding a new favorite spot, which I hated to leave, but then getting to discover yet another one. The insights in this book teach us so much more than how to birth.  They teach us how to be.  If you are a parent, want to be a parent, know a parent, have a parent, then read this book to find your inner map for how to prepare for birth, how to be with birth, how to talk with people about birth, how to simply BE."" --Carrie Kenner, Doula Trainer, Seattle, WA</p><p>""Pam England's wisdom helps women find their inner warrior, their empowering voice, their ability to trust their gut.""  <i>--Colleen Goidel, Doula &amp; Mentor, Atlanta, GA</i></p><div>""This book really shows the greater vision of Birthing From Within, which is about awakening the spirit. As I read it, I am given a new lens, a new map, for guiding parents, and also for looking at my own births. This has been so healing on many levels. Thank you!""  <i>--Michelle Beaulieu, Doula and Mentor, Sand Lake, NY</i><br/> <p>""<i>Ancient Map for Modern Birth</i> goes deeply into preparations for two rites of passage: childbirth and parenting. This book covers even more topics of interest to modern mothers and fathers (than Birthing From Within) and emphasizes the importance of staying flexible and open to the unknown possibilities and surprises that are a part of pregnancy, childbirth and parenting."" <i>--Rosanna Davis, CPM, Palo Alto, CA</i></p>

</div></div>","**December 1, 2016: BOOK IS BEING PRINTED! Please refer to the ""Updates"" page for the latest news on the book's production and delivery.****Thanks to over 460 backers, we reached and exceeded our original goal. Thank you!**We are keeping this campaign open, as we have a long list of projects (and costs) associated with our new book, Ancient Map for Modern Birth. First on the list is the e-book! We estimate this will cost between $4000-5000, so we are well on our way to making this a reality. The next item is a Spanish translation and distribution network, both in the U.S. and internationally. This is likely a $12,000-$15,000 project, which includes translation, design, printing, and marketing/distribution.So, we are aiming for $50,000 total to make these projects happen. As of today, we are adding the e-book as a perk, for only $10 (and no shipping!). This is a special discounted pre-order price. Keep spreading the word! And keep reading to learn more about our vision for changing the conversation about birth in our culture...
1. About the BookWhen Birthing From Within was published 18 years ago, it was hailed as a “landmark in the history of childbirth.” Since that time, Birthing From Within has been a leader in changing the conversation about birth. Some of the ideas Pam England presented that were seen as radical and controversial are now not only accepted and embraced, and have even gone mainstream. Now Pam England is ready to turn the childbirth preparation on its head—again!—with a book that presents the cohesive and evolved vision and model that has been developed and refined over many years of teaching, reflecting, and supporting thousands of parents and birth professionals around the world. This is the Ancient Map for Modern Birth.Pam has been working on this book (with the helps of Virginia Bobro and many others) for nearly five years: the writing is done, all the illustrations are complete (take a peek at a few of them in the gallery), and the final proofreading and book design are underway. Publication date is just around the corner: January 2017. Become a backer of this campaign and you will be first in line to get your hands on this book! You can help make this happen, and we need and value your support!Already, the Birthing From Within message has reached hundreds of thousands of families and professionals. Our trainings are in demand around the world, and BFW childbirth classes are offered in 20 countries around the world. There is demonstrated interest our approach to the childbirth preparation and healing. This book is eagerly awaited by those who are already a part of Birthing From Within.Every pregnant woman and birth professional will benefit from the compelling blend of current research intertwined with processes and stories that support a woman’s determination, self-respect, and readiness to deal with any type of birth, in any setting (from home to operating room). Our map, inspired by ancient teachings, offer the modern woman a step-by-step guide to understanding her emotional, physical, and psychological journey through the childbearing year. Readers will enjoy in-depth exploration of the story of Inanna, the Laborinth™, as well as practical information, art, rituals and ceremonies, mindfulness practices, and meditations that together provide a rich and stimulating pathway for women to discover personal and collective meaning during the profound rite of passage that is birth. Take a peek at the Table of Contents here.2. Why the book is self-published Did you know that Birthing From Within was self-published and is still one of the most successful and beloved childbirth books ever? Despite competing bids from several publishing houses, we decided to self-publish this new book. Here’s why: Ancient Map for Modern Birth is not like any other childbirth book out there. Self-publishing ensures creative control and a collaborative process between authors, artist, and designer. The complex and elegant interior design, including over 140 illustrations, is considerable and requires attention to detail by a skilled designer who really embraces our vision. We are so pleased with the look and feel of this book; what a joy it is to see it come to life in the way we envisioned.3. Reviews""This book reaches far beyond the typical pregnancy and childbirth book. It guides us to find that place inside every human being which connects us to an ancient way of knowing and way of being. When we are connected to that, we cannot get lost. The excitement I felt when reading this book was like embarking on a major journey.  Each chapter was filled with unexpected delights: a story, a remarkable illustration, a new practice. It was like finding a new favorite spot, which I hated to leave, but then getting to discover yet another one. The insights in this book teach us so much more than how to birth.  They teach us how to be.  If you are a parent, want to be a parent, know a parent, have a parent, then read this book to find your inner map for how to prepare for birth, how to be with birth, how to talk with people about birth, how to simply BE."" --Carrie Kenner, Doula Trainer, Seattle, WA""Pam England's wisdom helps women find their inner warrior, their empowering voice, their ability to trust their gut.""  --Colleen Goidel, Doula & Mentor, Atlanta, GA""This book really shows the greater vision of Birthing From Within, which is about awakening the spirit. As I read it, I am given a new lens, a new map, for guiding parents, and also for looking at my own births. This has been so healing on many levels. Thank you!""  --Michelle Beaulieu, Doula and Mentor, Sand Lake, NY ""Ancient Map for Modern Birth goes deeply into preparations for two rites of passage: childbirth and parenting. This book covers even more topics of interest to modern mothers and fathers (than Birthing From Within) and emphasizes the importance of staying flexible and open to the unknown possibilities and surprises that are a part of pregnancy, childbirth and parenting."" --Rosanna Davis, CPM, Palo Alto, CA

adorably witty children’s picture
book for ages 7 and up. It will give children the opportunity to
learn about self acceptance, the importance of acknowledging individualism and
their own uniqueness. This thirty-four page picture book was inspired by my personal
experiences with being bullied. I am the seventh, youngest and only American
born child of a Jamaican-Maroon Indian and a Jamaican-Turk Jew.  </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">I was under the impression that I was an only child and was being raised as such in Brooklyn, New York. I didn't
meet my four brothers and two sisters until I was three years old. When my parents completed
filing for my siblings’ citizenship to bring them to the U.S. I was a chubby
five year old. When they arrived they were quite mean and bullied me for years.
To make matters worse despite being born in America, I was raised in a West
Indian household and spoke Patois at school so I was bullied by American
children for my accent. I remember the feelings of helplessness, rejection and loneliness
that I felt and drew inspiration from those memories.</span></p><p></p>
<p> The story utilizes the West Indian moniker, “fatty
boom boom” which is an ambiguous term because it is deprecating yet it is also used
as an endearing  term in Jamaica; but is the American equivalent to the
derogatory word, fatso. In this endearing familial tale the lead character,
Nemah is a loveable chubby cheetah cub. She has two brothers, Nato and Nokey. But only Nokey truly
accepts her. Nato teases her for being overweight like the other cheetah cubs living in their Sout  African habitat. </p>
<p>In
spite of the ridicule and obvious physical obstacles, Nema surprises everyone
with her limitless spunk and literally saves the day for one of her
tormentors. Fatty Boom Boom is an adorable comical spin on an unsightly
societal blot plaguing youngsters across the globe. The story is infused with
positive messaging enabling children to grasp the importance of self esteem
from early on. </p>
<p>Bullying
incidents have escalated  and run the gamut from schools to the workplace.
The most disconcerting underlying issue is that young children are deeply
affected with emotional baggage carrying over into adulthood. In fact every
seven minutes a child is bullied which contributes to the formulation of their
psyche. </p>
<p>Fatty Boom Boom will aide children in learning self-worth
and individuality. They will also learn that differences make
the world an interesting place and bullying is just an attack on the very
things that makes human beings special. </p>

The purpose of Fatty Boom Boom is not only to shed light on the bullying epidemic but to also help our youth to love the skin they’re in. The charities chosen for the Fatty Boom Boom “Beat Bullying with Kindness” campaign do so much for our children so it would be a dream to be able to submit donations in the high digit range after the launch of the “Beat Bullying with Kindness” movement and campaign.Let's make a difference. The TeamNurit Folkes - Author/illustratorNico Sante - Creative consultantVictoria Campos Lauriston Simmonds Raphael Simmonds",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jacques Maudy.</p>
<p>I am a freelance photographer. My photography partner Jimi Casaccia and I<strong> volunteered with the Yangon Heritage Trust in Burma to photo document the historical buildings of Rangoon</strong>.</p>
<p>Rangoon, now Yangon is the capital of Burma also called Myanmar. Thanks to 50 years of dictaorship and economic embargo Yangon is the <em>LAST INTACT CITY</em> in Asia. Its amazing architecture is at risk and I’m going to tell you why…</p>
<p>Our photos have had a lot of interest in the media. We decided to make a book, Yangon A City to Rescue, to hold the Myanmar ministers accountable to their promises.</p>
<p>The photos are done. The layout is ready. Now we need your help to print it and launch it. Three photo exhibitions are already planned where the book will be launched - In Yangon, Bangkok and Brisbane. More will be organised with your help.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We travelled to Yangon in May and June 2012. We took the most comprehensive and compelling set of photos of Yangon and its beautiful people - see what the media says about our photos further down. The layout of the book is done and the book is <strong>ready to print</strong>. <strong>It is a 56 pages photo coffee table book 20 x 30 cm (7.87 x 11.81 inches)</strong>. The book is part of the global campaign of awareness about the dangers that Yangon landscapes faces. It is part of the pressure on government ministers to issue conservation regulations to contain the developers. We need the funds to print ""Yangon a City to Rescue"" and cover the costs of the launch.</p>
<p>Donors get our warmest thanks, their names listed in the book and on the website, signed original limited serie prints on metallic paper to hang in their home or office and signed ciopies of the first edition of the book.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal the number of pages of the book will be reduced to 44 but the book will be printed no matter what.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since the Nobel prize and democracy fighter Aung San Suu Kyi was freed from her 15 years of house arrest, Myanmar has been on my radar. It seemed that the president Thein Sein had decided to lead his country towards democracy. I wanted to witness the hope of the Burmese people.</p>
<p>I came across a video clip on the net where Sonny Thein, one of the founders of the Yangon Heritage Trust, was describing the risks the heritage buildings of Yangon were now facing. If Myanmar headed towards democracy the western embargo would be soon lifted (tembargo has now been lifted since July 2012) and the skyline of Yangon would indeed be at risk. I contacted Sonny immediately and offered to volunteer with the Yangon Heritage Trust to document the historical buildings.</p>
<p>He wrote back: “Come now! We are holding an international conference on the 1<sup>st</sup> of June and we need to display the photos at the conference. The ministers and conservation experts will be here. Come now.” The monsoon was pouring down on Yangon.  <strong>There are at least 180 buildings worth saving in the city.</strong> In 6 days the task was impossible for a photographer alone. <strong>And here came the first miracle -</strong>  Jimi Casaccia, and Italian traveller, was couchsurfing at my place. We had become friends instantly. I forgot to tell you that Jimi is an amazing, extremely talented photographer. He jumped on board without thinking twice.</p>
<p>Myanmar was nothing like we expected. Beautiful people who give you their heart for a smile<em>.</em> Yangon was simmering with hope and energy.</p>
<p>With Jimi we agreed to treat all the pictures the same way. <strong>We wanted to grab the officials' attention and make them realize what would be lost if they didn’t listen to the advice of the experts.</strong> We didn’t want flat technical architectural photography. We wanted drama<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>And here came the second miracle At the conference the Myanmar ministers committed to hold off <strong>any further building permits until the Yangon Heritage Trust issued guidelines of conservation</strong>. </strong><strong>It was a win</strong>. We had the feeling that we had contributed to something worth the sweat.</p>
<p><strong>So here comes the book</strong>. <strong>A book</strong> many Burmese people who fled the country under the dictators want to see. <strong>A book</strong> that will freeze time in 2013 and will hold the ministers accountable to their promises. <strong>A book</strong> that we can only print with your help.</p>

<p>WHAT AM I RAISING MONEY FOR?</p>
<p>To self-publish my second book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ABOUT MY BOOK</p>
<p>I am a tattoo artist and the majority of my clients are women. I have noticed that there are three main motivations that they have for getting tattoos:</p>
<p>1. Freedom</p>
<p>2. Grief</p>
<p>3. Connection</p>
<p>Under this umbrella of motivations there are celebratory sub-themes which include self-expression, awakening, a finalised divorce, escape from abuse, finding a 'tribe', recovery from addictions, coming out and coming of age, to name a few. And then there are those reasons which are yet to resolved or made peace with such as loss of a loved one, loss of a baby or loss of self; therefore, many of the designs I create are for memorial tattoos, images of hope, or covering of self-harm scars. </p>
<p>Without disclosing any identities or confidential stories, I share these main themes and the way I relate to them myself. With so much darkness creeping to the fore in the recent Covid years, I have witnessed even more boldness and bravery by women who realise that life really is too short to stay in the shadows or play it small. Requests for full sleeves, large sternum pieces, mastectomy scar covers, and a focus on celestial, mystical and witchy designs, show me that a fierce feminine force is stepping up and She wants to be seen. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHERE THE BOOK TITLE CAME FROM</p>
<p>I began my tattoo apprenticeship in 2017 with a funny, kind and characterful Thai mentor. In 2020 I was asked to join ‘The Mansell Collection,’ and I now run a studio within the business, bringing some feminine energy and creativity to the male-heavy environment. Over the last four years I have gained a wealth of insight into the many secret worlds of women and why they want to get inked. They willingly suffer hours under the needle in order to brand their skin with art and affirmations. My mentor used to laugh and say to me: “No Pain, No Stain!” His words were more profound than he realised. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>MY READERS</p>
<p><i>No Pain, No Stain </i> is not a self-help book or a diary, rather, an enchanting, funny and deep thought-provoking story. It is a memoir which draws upon my own challenging life-experiences: my yearning for freedom, my battles with body image, my struggle to find harmony between what I feel <i>called </i> to do in this world and what I <i>have </i> to do to make a living. And it refers to the practice of tattooing to explore how withstanding pain and darkness is sometimes necessary—and even a voluntary act—in order to gain something permanent in our often superficial and disposable society.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>MY PREVIOUS BOOK</p>
<p>Last year I self-published a memoir called <i>I Must be a Mermaid </i>: <i>Deep Fear of Shallow Living</i>, which retails on Amazon. On a small scale it was a massive success. I receive so many emotional reviews and DMs from readers who were extremely touched by my story and the level of honesty at which I wrote. It has become very clear who my audience are; they are women of all ages who are searching for more meaning, more magic and more freedom in their lives. They are women who are fed up with feeling ashamed of themselves or of their past, and gain comfort in my rawness about desires, dreams, sexuality, spirituality and unwillingness to conform. I have been so surprised by how most people tell me they read it in just one or two days, that they felt like I was writing <i>their</i> story in some way, that it has relieved anxiety—and I have been blown away by some who go as far as to say it has changed their lives, setting them on a new path. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHAT I NEED AND WHAT FOR</p>
<p>My last book was published in 2020 by a wonderful online company called <i>Happy Self-Publishing</i>. I was so impressed away by their friendly and 'go-the-extra-mile' approach. Its founder, Jyotsna Ramachandran is an inspiring woman, a really positive-minded entrepreneur who contacted me personally over Zoom to talk excitedly about my project.</p>
<p>I would absolutely LOVE to one day have a literary agent and gain a contact with a traditional publishing house who can market and distribute my books worldwide, not to  mention cover production costs. It's just not happened for me—yet. But the rebel in me refuses watch the years pass by while my work doesn't get out there.</p>
<p>It costs £800 to publish (doing my own editing), and I aim to have it completed by Spring 2022. However, it takes me a long time to save up the money, then more time to start the self-publishing process. My reason for starting a crowdfunding campaign <i>now</i> is so my readers (who are badgering me to write the second book!) can start enjoying and benefitting from it asap, rather than waiting another couple of years.</p>
<p>If you can contribute financially (£2 will make a difference) that would be amazing. If not, then I totally understand. Any sharing of this link would be most appreciated too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ABOUT ME</p>
<p>Originally from Surrey in South East England, I went to Art and Design college before backpacking across the globe at eighteen with my bestie. I then studied for a three year Illustration degree in South Wales. After a couple of years living in London and a bit of an early-life-crisis, I moved to the Channel Islands to start afresh and be by the sea. Now, I am a tattoo artist and a writer, living with my husband and our two little Yorkshire terriers. This year I turn forty and I feel like I'm just getting started. </p>

Under this umbrella of motivations there are celebratory sub-themes which include self-expression, awakening, a finalised divorce, escape from abuse, finding a 'tribe', recovery from addictions, coming out and coming of age, to name a few. And then there are those reasons which are yet to resolved or made peace with such as loss of a loved one, loss of a baby or loss of self; therefore, many of the designs I create are for memorial tattoos, images of hope, or covering of self-harm scars. 
Without disclosing any identities or confidential stories, I share these main themes and the way I relate to them myself. With so much darkness creeping to the fore in the recent Covid years, I have witnessed even more boldness and bravery by women who realise that life really is too short to stay in the shadows or play it small. Requests for full sleeves, large sternum pieces, mastectomy scar covers, and a focus on celestial, mystical and witchy designs, show me that a fierce feminine force is stepping up and She wants to be seen. 
 
WHERE THE BOOK TITLE CAME FROM
I began my tattoo apprenticeship in 2017 with a funny, kind and characterful Thai mentor. In 2020 I was asked to join ‘The Mansell Collection,’ and I now run a studio within the business, bringing some feminine energy and creativity to the male-heavy environment. Over the last four years I have gained a wealth of insight into the many secret worlds of women and why they want to get inked. They willingly suffer hours under the needle in order to brand their skin with art and affirmations. My mentor used to laugh and say to me: “No Pain, No Stain!” His words were more profound than he realised. 
 
MY READERS
No Pain, No Stain  is not a self-help book or a diary, rather, an enchanting, funny and deep thought-provoking story. It is a memoir which draws upon my own challenging life-experiences: my yearning for freedom, my battles with body image, my struggle to find harmony between what I feel called  to do in this world and what I have  to do to make a living. And it refers to the practice of tattooing to explore how withstanding pain and darkness is sometimes necessary—and even a voluntary act—in order to gain something permanent in our often superficial and disposable society.
 
MY PREVIOUS BOOK
Last year I self-published a memoir called I Must be a Mermaid : Deep Fear of Shallow Living, which retails on Amazon. On a small scale it was a massive success. I receive so many emotional reviews and DMs from readers who were extremely touched by my story and the level of honesty at which I wrote. It has become very clear who my audience are; they are women of all ages who are searching for more meaning, more magic and more freedom in their lives. They are women who are fed up with feeling ashamed of themselves or of their past, and gain comfort in my rawness about desires, dreams, sexuality, spirituality and unwillingness to conform. I have been so surprised by how most people tell me they read it in just one or two days, that they felt like I was writing their story in some way, that it has relieved anxiety—and I have been blown away by some who go as far as to say it has changed their lives, setting them on a new path. 
 
WHAT I NEED AND WHAT FOR
My last book was published in 2020 by a wonderful online company called Happy Self-Publishing. I was so impressed away by their friendly and 'go-the-extra-mile' approach. Its founder, Jyotsna Ramachandran is an inspiring woman, a really positive-minded entrepreneur who contacted me personally over Zoom to talk excitedly about my project.
I would absolutely LOVE to one day have a literary agent and gain a contact with a traditional publishing house who can market and distribute my books worldwide, not to  mention cover production costs. It's just not happened for me—yet. But the rebel in me refuses watch the years pass by while my work doesn't get out there.
It costs £800 to publish (doing my own editing), and I aim to have it completed by Spring 2022. However, it takes me a long time to save up the money, then more time to start the self-publishing process. My reason for starting a crowdfunding campaign now is so my readers (who are badgering me to write the second book!) can start enjoying and benefitting from it asap, rather than waiting another couple of years.
If you can contribute financially (£2 will make a difference) that would be amazing. If not, then I totally understand. Any sharing of this link would be most appreciated too.
 
ABOUT ME
Originally from Surrey in South East England, I went to Art and Design college before backpacking across the globe at eighteen with my bestie. I then studied for a three year Illustration degree in South Wales. After a couple of years living in London and a bit of an early-life-crisis, I moved to the Channel Islands to start afresh and be by the sea. Now, I am a tattoo artist and a writer, living with my husband and our two little Yorkshire terriers. This year I turn forty and I feel like I'm just getting started.

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<p><i>You Must Be A Jones </i>is my family’s story of how our parents, a committed and hardworking African American couple, created a happy and wholesome life and promising futures for their seven children despite the limitations of segregation and racism.</p>
<p>My name is Lydia Cole and I am the author of <i>You Must Be A Jones</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to offer a personal perspective on life for an average African American family growing up during some of the country’s most significant periods of change.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you gain a glimpse into the lives of one large black family who refused to let racism and modest means keep them from reaching their goals. I want readers of this book to see the world through our eyes, as we lived it. To see our family and other African American families like ours who refused to be held down and held back. Readers will engage with themes about the impact of segregation and integration, the power of a close family and determined parents, the magic of growing up in a place where everyone knows your name (something mundane), and learn alongside my brothers and sisters about the importance of never giving up.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of values and families, and perseverance and race, through narratives such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Family was always primary for us. That was never truer than when my grandmother, Nana, died. Our uncle, Dede, lived with her. He would never be able to live alone after contracting Parkinson’s Disease while serving in the army. After my grandmother’s passing, Dede moved into our house — a four-bedroom house with one bathroom, where six children and two adults already lived. Our house was full but never crowded. We always found a way to be there for each other.</li>
<li>Our parents had a teamwork approach to raising the seven of us. Mom was the main disciplinarian, caring for us and the household. On the weekends, Dad took a more active role including handling the grocery shopping and taking some of us along. On those trips to the grocery store, my twin brother, younger sister and I would visit the five and dime store where we would have our first encounters with racism. We were around seven or eight years old when we started going there and an old white lady followed and watched us whenever we entered the store. We experienced racism at a young age.</li>
<li>Our brother, Mike, was one of four black students to integrate into the schools in the state of Virginia. Despite the hold of segregation being broken, it would take many years before black students felt included in the integrated junior and high school communities. When our sister Roz attended Stratford two years after Mike, she imagined that she would make friends. Not only did that not happen, the school’s assistant principal kept Roz from attending a regional sports day that her class had chosen for her to attend, claiming it would be better for her not to go.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in reading about the joys and challenges of black family life in 1950's and 1960's America.</p>
<p><i>You Must Be A Jones</i> speaks to people who enjoy stories about the intersection of family life and history, and who want to grapple with the lived experience of black families in a segregated America. Readers who want to gain insight about the challenges faced by black families during segregation and still today, in a new way, will begin to understand what it means to be viewed as less-than and excluded for nothing more than the color of their skin.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope that <i>You Must Be A Jones</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a parent, what is the key to raising self-confident, happy, caring children equipped to handle life’s challenges?</li>
<li>What role does a spiritual relationship play in preparing children for the future?</li>
<li>What is the real-life impact of living in a country that values one group of citizens over another?</li>
<li>What is the role of the public education system to teach history that includes all citizens’ contributions in the making of America?</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing how to overcome the effects of racial inequity, leverage the benefits of educational opportunity, instill family values, and understand the magic inherent in a community that exemplifies a real-life “village” will change us all for the better.</p>
<h3><strong>The Book - You Must Be A Jones</strong></h3>
<p>The book is written in 4 Parts....</p>
<p><strong>Part 1: The Introduction + Chapters 1-7.</strong> Part One of <i>You Must Be A Jones</i> begins with the reader experiencing a Jones family Thanksgiving — one of our most important family gatherings. The story then takes the reader back in time to introduce our parents’ families, the Joneses and Greenes. You’ll learn how a profound loss for our mother changed her life, forcing her family to relocate back to Arlington, where our Dad also grew up. We see how Mom and Dad experience adversity as young people, and their choice to embrace hope and faith in tough times became foundational characteristics of life as they marry and start their family.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Chapters 8-11. </strong>Part Two of our story is all about community and family. It's filled with heartwarming stories of growing up in a small African American neighborhood where everybody knows everyone else. It shines a light on our community's decades-long battle to provide the best public education to their children, as we confronted racism and segregation in our day-to-day life. Through it all, you'll see how our faith and involvement in the church was central to believing in a better tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3: Chapters 12-17. </strong>Part Three begins with Dad's life-long dream to send all of his children to college unfolding. As teenagers, we experience the tradeoffs that came with attending a school where our presence was often and easily ignored even after successfully integrating the Arlington County school system. It's a period of ongoing change with several of us going to college, some of us going to war, and all of us coming of age.</p>
<p><strong>Part 4: Chapters 18-19.</strong> Part Four is dedicated to our parent's legacy and the realization of their dreams through their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. My siblings and I remember our parents, our community, and the gift of love and devotion we were blessed to receive.</p>

<p>Lydia Cole is a highly experienced communication professional with thirty years of experience across several disciplines, including broadcast and cable television and corporate communications. She currently consults with organizations and businesses supporting digital communications, social media, and strategic communications planning.</p>
<p>It is my hope that by sharing our family's story, people will gain a more accurate perspective of black family life. One that is uplifting and shines a light on the real-life ups and downs of black family life rarely told.</p>
<p>Beyond my venture into writing this book, I’m true to my heritage. I’m a family person, devoted to my children, my husband, and my siblings and their children. As a teenager, I became obsessed with knowing more about my grandparents and their parents and aunts and uncles. I routinely looked at family albums, hoping to learn something that I didn’t know before. Since that time, I’ve spent many hours researching my family’s genealogy and uncovering long-forgotten or little known facts about our family and heritage.</p>

I still have 9 more days left in the campaign and hope to reach the next level of funding. If I am able to reach the $6,000 goal, I can also publish You Must Be A Jones as a hardcover book in April 2021.
Thank you so much for contributing and supporting the publication of my first book!

Story of My Book
You Must Be A Jones is my family’s story of how our parents, a committed and hardworking African American couple, created a happy and wholesome life and promising futures for their seven children despite the limitations of segregation and racism.
My name is Lydia Cole and I am the author of You Must Be A Jones. I wrote this book because I wanted to offer a personal perspective on life for an average African American family growing up during some of the country’s most significant periods of change.
My hope is that, in reading this book, you gain a glimpse into the lives of one large black family who refused to let racism and modest means keep them from reaching their goals. I want readers of this book to see the world through our eyes, as we lived it. To see our family and other African American families like ours who refused to be held down and held back. Readers will engage with themes about the impact of segregation and integration, the power of a close family and determined parents, the magic of growing up in a place where everyone knows your name (something mundane), and learn alongside my brothers and sisters about the importance of never giving up.
In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of values and families, and perseverance and race, through narratives such as:

Family was always primary for us. That was never truer than when my grandmother, Nana, died. Our uncle, Dede, lived with her. He would never be able to live alone after contracting Parkinson’s Disease while serving in the army. After my grandmother’s passing, Dede moved into our house — a four-bedroom house with one bathroom, where six children and two adults already lived. Our house was full but never crowded. We always found a way to be there for each other.
Our parents had a teamwork approach to raising the seven of us. Mom was the main disciplinarian, caring for us and the household. On the weekends, Dad took a more active role including handling the grocery shopping and taking some of us along. On those trips to the grocery store, my twin brother, younger sister and I would visit the five and dime store where we would have our first encounters with racism. We were around seven or eight years old when we started going there and an old white lady followed and watched us whenever we entered the store. We experienced racism at a young age.
Our brother, Mike, was one of four black students to integrate into the schools in the state of Virginia. Despite the hold of segregation being broken, it would take many years before black students felt included in the integrated junior and high school communities. When our sister Roz attended Stratford two years after Mike, she imagined that she would make friends. Not only did that not happen, the school’s assistant principal kept Roz from attending a regional sports day that her class had chosen for her to attend, claiming it would be better for her not to go.

You will love this book if you are interested in reading about the joys and challenges of black family life in 1950's and 1960's America.
You Must Be A Jones speaks to people who enjoy stories about the intersection of family life and history, and who want to grapple with the lived experience of black families in a segregated America. Readers who want to gain insight about the challenges faced by black families during segregation and still today, in a new way, will begin to understand what it means to be viewed as less-than and excluded for nothing more than the color of their skin.
Ultimately, I hope that You Must Be A Jones inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:

As a parent, what is the key to raising self-confident, happy, caring children equipped to handle life’s challenges?
What role does a spiritual relationship play in preparing children for the future?
What is the real-life impact of living in a country that values one group of citizens over another?
What is the role of the public education system to teach history that includes all citizens’ contributions in the making of America?

I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing how to overcome the effects of racial inequity, leverage the benefits of educational opportunity, instill family values, and understand the magic inherent in a community that exemplifies a real-life “village” will change us all for the better.
The Book - You Must Be A Jones
The book is written in 4 Parts....
Part 1: The Introduction + Chapters 1-7. Part One of You Must Be A Jones begins with the reader experiencing a Jones family Thanksgiving — one of our most important family gatherings. The story then takes the reader back in time to introduce our parents’ families, the Joneses and Greenes. You’ll learn how a profound loss for our mother changed her life, forcing her family to relocate back to Arlington, where our Dad also grew up. We see how Mom and Dad experience adversity as young people, and their choice to embrace hope and faith in tough times became foundational characteristics of life as they marry and start their family.
Part 2: Chapters 8-11. Part Two of our story is all about community and family. It's filled with heartwarming stories of growing up in a small African American neighborhood where everybody knows everyone else. It shines a light on our community's decades-long battle to provide the best public education to their children, as we confronted racism and segregation in our day-to-day life. Through it all, you'll see how our faith and involvement in the church was central to believing in a better tomorrow.
Part 3: Chapters 12-17. Part Three begins with Dad's life-long dream to send all of his children to college unfolding. As teenagers, we experience the tradeoffs that came with attending a school where our presence was often and easily ignored even after successfully integrating the Arlington County school system. It's a period of ongoing change with several of us going to college, some of us going to war, and all of us coming of age.
Part 4: Chapters 18-19. Part Four is dedicated to our parent's legacy and the realization of their dreams through their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. My siblings and I remember our parents, our community, and the gift of love and devotion we were blessed to receive.

About the Author

Lydia Cole is a highly experienced communication professional with thirty years of experience across several disciplines, including broadcast and cable television and corporate communications. She currently consults with organizations and businesses supporting digital communications, social media, and strategic communications planning.
It is my hope that by sharing our family's story, people will gain a more accurate perspective of black family life. One that is uplifting and shines a light on the real-life ups and downs of black family life rarely told.
Beyond my venture into writing this book, I’m true to my heritage. I’m a family person, devoted to my children, my husband, and my siblings and their children. As a teenager, I became obsessed with knowing more about my grandparents and their parents and aunts and uncles. I routinely looked at family albums, hoping to learn something that I didn’t know before. Since that time, I’ve spent many hours researching my family’s genealogy and uncovering long-forgotten or little known facts about our family and heritage.

<p><strong>La boca del lobo</strong> es una novela mestiza, con lo mejor del género negro y del suspense fantástico.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">María, una joven de dieciocho años de edad y criada en un ambiente religioso y tradicional, se dispone a disfrutar por primera vez de un fin de semana con su pareja y amigos.

El peligro, que ya acechó a María cuando apenas contaba con ocho años y de lo que apenas guardaba recuerdo alguno, ha vuelto, con el único fin de terminar lo que empezó diez años atrás. Por eso, tendrá que pelear para poder acabar con el mal que se empeña en darle caza. Para ello, será necesario que busque ayuda y... quizá esa sea la peor idea de todas, pues aquellos que deberían ponerse de su lado tendrán otras intenciones.

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<p><i>To Hear a Girl Scream: A Memoir of Dreams and Insights in the 21st Century</i> is a book that explores racial identity and growing up in the 2000s in the American South.<br/><br/>My name is Camryn Cobb and I am the author of <i>To Hear a Girl Scream</i>. I wrote this book because, as someone who is biracial, I feel that I have a unique perspective when it comes to race and how different cultures interact in America. It has always been a dream of mine to write a book, and this book contains my most intimate thoughts about what the world has looked like to me over the years.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that we as humans share more experiences than those that divide us. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for social justice and equality. Ultimately, I want you to view this book as a tool to help you see the world in a more inclusive light.<br/><br/>In <i>To Hear a Girl Scream</i>, you'll learn about the importance of racial identity and how major events have affected young adults who are a part of Generation Z. Some stories from my book include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Mixed With Two,” in which I share my early experience of discovering I was biracial and understanding what race was</li>
<li>“Token Black Friends,“ where I share stories about the relationship between my childhood best friend and me as we grew up being the only people of color in predominately white spaces</li>
<li>“The 2016 Election,'” in which I explore my thoughts and feelings about this election cycle as a then-senior in high school, just shy of voter age</li>
</ul>You will love this book if you’re interested in understanding what the world looks like to someone who is racially ambiguous or if you want to hear more about the change that young people desire.<br/><br/><i>To Hear a Girl Scream</i> is a memoir-style book that speaks to young adults and open-minded souls who are looking at political optimism and challenging structural systems for the first time.<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - To Hear a Girl Scream</h3>
<br/>The book is written in <strong>3 Parts</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the Author’s Note and Chapters 1-5. In this section, as a young person bound by time, I discuss my dreams and worries concerning the world around me. I explore how the surplus of new opportunities contrasts with the disheartening lack of change I have encountered during my 20 years of life.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters 6-9. In this section, I dive deep into how I have been shaped by my interactions with my loved ones and everyone around me. I offer keen insights about how my identity affects the way I am perceived by others and the way I navigate in American society.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains Chapters 10-16. This section contains many of my stories and memories - from attending middle school to becoming a first-generation college student - while addressing the good, the bad, and the ugly of being a biracial minority in predominately white spaces.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>

<br/>About the Author</h3>
<br/>Camryn Cobb studies political research and communication in the advanced graduate program at the University of Georgia, where she is pursuing both a Bachelor of Family and Consumer Science and a Master of Science.<br/><br/>Camryn wrote this book because she (unknowingly) came into this world by making a statement. Being both white and black - two races historically pitted against each other in the South — she has learned to embrace this unique part of herself, and she’s eager to help different cultures and identities better coexist in the future.<br/><br/>Camryn is the first person to bring up political subjects or any other potentially uncomfortable conversational topics because she finds joy in authenticity and rawness. Her dreams span from encouraging her friends to think about the world in a new way to early-campaigning for the seat in the White House she will one day occupy.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Camryn at camryncobb@uga.edu and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/camryncobb/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.linkedin.com/in/camryncobb/</a>.<h3> </h3>

The book is written in 3 Parts.Part 1 contains the Author’s Note and Chapters 1-5. In this section, as a young person bound by time, I discuss my dreams and worries concerning the world around me. I explore how the surplus of new opportunities contrasts with the disheartening lack of change I have encountered during my 20 years of life.Part 2 contains Chapters 6-9. In this section, I dive deep into how I have been shaped by my interactions with my loved ones and everyone around me. I offer keen insights about how my identity affects the way I am perceived by others and the way I navigate in American society.Part 3 contains Chapters 10-16. This section contains many of my stories and memories - from attending middle school to becoming a first-generation college student - while addressing the good, the bad, and the ugly of being a biracial minority in predominately white spaces. What I Need & What You'll Get
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following: 
The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July 2020.

The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)
The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication
The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this summer.
 When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:
You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish
A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book

About the Author
Camryn Cobb studies political research and communication in the advanced graduate program at the University of Georgia, where she is pursuing both a Bachelor of Family and Consumer Science and a Master of Science.Camryn wrote this book because she (unknowingly) came into this world by making a statement. Being both white and black - two races historically pitted against each other in the South — she has learned to embrace this unique part of herself, and she’s eager to help different cultures and identities better coexist in the future.Camryn is the first person to bring up political subjects or any other potentially uncomfortable conversational topics because she finds joy in authenticity and rawness. Her dreams span from encouraging her friends to think about the world in a new way to early-campaigning for the seat in the White House she will one day occupy.For more information, you can connect with Camryn at camryncobb@uga.edu and www.linkedin.com/in/camryncobb/. 
Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<h3>When Our Haven Burned</h3>
<p>From the top of his sleek tower, Aldrix Sterling looks down upon a city lit by his power, but darkened by his greed. Amidst a fierce battle between his energy company and environmentalists, he oscillates between addressing the demands of his position and the human consequences of his neglect. </p>
<p>In the halls of power, Mayor Emerald Silva is determined to enact policies that will prevent others from sharing the fate of her lost home. But in an environment where many refuse to accept her as one of their own, she learns that making a difference may require some work in the shadows.</p>
<p>Freshly out of prison, Ezra is focused on a single thing: <i>revenge</i>. But as he comes to see the suffering in his community, he strives to both be part of the solution and eliminate the problem through any means necessary.</p>
<p>Told through an interconnected ensemble of perspectives, this collective narrative encompasses everyone from a brilliant dropout to a deaf father and a driven climate activist as they watch climate realities impact their communities in starkly different ways. As tensions in the city rise and destructive forces sweep through, every resident is forced to confront their own histories. And ultimately, they each find themselves caught between memories of the past and fear for the future as they try to keep their beloved city from burning in the present.</p>

<h3><strong>Who is Kerry Malone?</strong></h3>
<p>My first children’s book was released in October 2015. <i>You can do it Joey!</i> was meant to be a small project for my great-niece Tayla. When Meaghan Thomson came on board to do a couple of illustrations for me the project grew into a fully-fledged Indie publishing adventure! </p>
<p>And what an adventure it has been, learning about the children’s publishing industry and meeting fabulous creators and booksellers. <i>You can do it Joey!</i> is in the homes of children and families all around the world.</p>
<p>It’s now time to produce new books and this series is special. The original idea for the series occurred at a particularly difficult time in my life when I had low vision, before a lot of surgery restored my eyesight. At a time when I was nearly blind and struggling with changes in my life I wrote a story about a little girl going to school for the first time wearing glasses. This story has morphed in Sophie’s series and some of her stories are based on my experiences as child who wore glasses from a young age.</p>
<h3><strong>The book and the series</strong></h3>
<p><i>Sophie Makes New Friends</i> is the first book in my series of three chapter books for readers aged 6 - 9 years of age. Meaghan Thomson who illustrated <i>You can do it Joey!</i> is back to create more beautiful illustrations and design the series.</p>
<p>The series tells Sophie’s story as her family moves from the country to the city. She is anxious about making new friends in a big city school and has insecurities around wearing glasses. </p>
<p><i><b>Sophie Makes New Friends</b></i></p>
<p>It’s Sophie’s first day at her new big city school. Without her old friends, who will sit with her at recess? Will she make new friends?</p>
<p>She eventually finds the courage to say hello to Phoebe. Will Phoebe convince Sophie to join the skipping team?</p>
<p><i><b>Sophie’s New Glasses</b></i></p>
<p>Sophie has made some friends at her new school and it’s not long until the netball season starts. </p>
<p>Wearing glasses while playing netball in the rain has its challenges but when Sophie's glasses are broken during a game this creates a different set of problems. </p>
<p><i><b>Sophie’s Party Invitation</b></i></p>
<p>Sophie has been invited to Phoebe’s birthday party at the pool and then a special sleepover afterwards. </p>
<p>Sophie wants to go to Phoebe’s party but can’t wear her glasses in the pool. Will she be able to play and have fun with her friends? Will she ask her friends for help? </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>How will the money raised be used?</strong></h3>
<p>The money raised will be put towards the cost of illustrating, designing and printing book one of the series, <i>Sophie</i> <i>M</i><i>akes New Friends</i>. Illustrating and designing children's books takes a lot of skill and time and is an expensive process. Sophie’s story develops during the three books as she makes new friends and enjoys new experiences in the city and the dream is to release the series during the next two years.</p>
<p>Please have a look at the perks on the right hand side and if you are able to purchase one I would be eternally grateful. Your support will give me an idea of how many books I need to print and also help towards paying Meaghan for her beautiful work.</p>
<p>By pre-ordering your copy and/or copies for friends and family or your local school library, you will help bring this book and the series to life.</p>
<h3>How long is the campaign?</h3>
<p>The campaign will run until the 31st of July 2018 and <i>Sophie Makes New Friends</i> will be available in November 2018. </p>

I live in the town of Damak, in eastern Nepal. When I was 18 years old, just as I was about to head to university, I fell from the balcony of my home and landed on my back. I sustained a spinal cord injury from the fall, and when I became conscious a few days later, I was told some terrible news—I'd never be able to walk again. Those words sounded so unreal.  Like other people whose lives change instantly because of a split-second accident, I became angry at life, and very depressed. I remember thinking what a hopeful and happy person I was before the injury, and I wondered where that hope had gone and why it had left me.</p><p style=""font-weight: normal;"">But while in the hospital, a friend gave me a book to read, and that book really saved my life. As I read the first few pages, I realized that despite my condition, I was still fortunate to be able to read. I asked family and friends to bring more books when they visited, and by the end of my long hospital stay, I had read nearly 200 books. Reading really helped ease my pain, not by allowing me to escape it, but by making me realize that I still had value—that I could still contribute something. When I returned home, I was bound to a wheelchair but I realized there was a great opportunity in front of me: my town had no library, and my family had no money, but I had 200 books, so with those books I asked my parents if we could start our town's first library-- in our home.  With their support, we cleaned out a room of our house, asked neighbors to donate books and bookshelves, and officially opened <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/damakpubliclibrary"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Damak Public Library</a> in December 2012.</p>

<p><b>How you can help us build a sustainable, fully-stocked library</b></p>
<p>Our library has been very well received by the community, and since our opening, we often have more than 50 visitors coming every day. Recently we asked our users how they envision the future of our library, and based on their feedback, we understand that we need a larger, more central space for our library, with at least several computers, desks and chairs in addition to more books so that we can best serve our community and keep the library growing for generations to come. There's things we're doing to make this happen, and there are things we are asking for your support given our limited resources here.</p>
<p><b><i>What we're doing ourselves:</i></b></p><p></p><p></p><ul>

I live in the town of Damak, in eastern Nepal. When I was 18 years old, just as I was about to head to university, I fell from the balcony of my home and landed on my back. I sustained a spinal cord injury from the fall, and when I became conscious a few days later, I was told some terrible news—I'd never be able to walk again. Those words sounded so unreal.  Like other people whose lives change instantly because of a split-second accident, I became angry at life, and very depressed. I remember thinking what a hopeful and happy person I was before the injury, and I wondered where that hope had gone and why it had left me.But while in the hospital, a friend gave me a book to read, and that book really saved my life. As I read the first few pages, I realized that despite my condition, I was still fortunate to be able to read. I asked family and friends to bring more books when they visited, and by the end of my long hospital stay, I had read nearly 200 books. Reading really helped ease my pain, not by allowing me to escape it, but by making me realize that I still had value—that I could still contribute something. When I returned home, I was bound to a wheelchair but I realized there was a great opportunity in front of me: my town had no library, and my family had no money, but I had 200 books, so with those books I asked my parents if we could start our town's first library-- in our home.  With their support, we cleaned out a room of our house, asked neighbors to donate books and bookshelves, and officially opened Damak Public Library in December 2012.

How you can help us build a sustainable, fully-stocked library
Our library has been very well received by the community, and since our opening, we often have more than 50 visitors coming every day. Recently we asked our users how they envision the future of our library, and based on their feedback, we understand that we need a larger, more central space for our library, with at least several computers, desks and chairs in addition to more books so that we can best serve our community and keep the library growing for generations to come. There's things we're doing to make this happen, and there are things we are asking for your support given our limited resources here.
What we're doing ourselves:

Collecting used books from our community and throughout the region


Local fundraising: we've already raised funds with the gracious support of two international organizations based in Damak 


Have established a library card system so that books are not lost


Operate the library at minimal cost through our founder and a team of volunteers


Continue to promote the library by showcasing local talent (authors, artists, educators) at events throughout our community 

What we are fundraising and how $5,000 will get us started:

Rent for the new building location for the 1st and 2nd years = $2,400


3 Desktop computers= $1,050


Additional books = $1,000


2 battery inverter = $300


Computer tables, study tables and chairs = $250

How we'll utilize funds if we can exceed our minimum goal:

Additional rent for the building for the 3rd- 5th years = $3,600


Full-time staff member (salary for 2 years, based on local rates) = $2,800


Additional books = $2,000


3 additional desktop computers = $1,000


Utilities for 3 additional years = $1,350


Scholarships for talented but financially needy students = $500

Additional book shelves, tables and chairs = $500
