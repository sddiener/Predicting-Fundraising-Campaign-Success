<p>Over the past 8 years we developed our own proprietary way of

<p></p>This type of software conversion enables ENGINEERS and DESIGNERS to quickly

Converting Mesh DATA into CAD DATA; we saw the benefit of utilizing this type

<p>We are putting our manufacturing

<p></p>
<p>All the components were structurally
designed to a maximum weight <b><i>rating of 400 lbs, per person</i></b>.
Depending upon the model of furniture, the weight rating increases by a factor
of how many people can fit on it.</p>
<p>After R&amp;D was completed, we
started manufacturing the preliminary molds, to make the carbon fiber frames.
To keep the cost overhead low, the molds were machined from a high density foam
instead of aluminum. These molds were only intended to produce 10-15 parts a
piece.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Now, due to the high retailers' and

<p>To meet our budgetary numbers, we want to manufacture STAPLE units

<b>Timeline:</b><br/>
</h2>
<p>Once we have received the funding,
we will begin with the machining of the aluminum molds. The CAD data is all
there, so we only need to machine the same molds out of aluminum instead of
high density foam. This will only take us 3-4 weeks to complete once the
funding is complete, since we have to purchase the aluminum blocks, which will
weigh in access of 425 lbs a piece! A lot of money in the material alone!!</p>
<p>Once the molds are complete, we can

<p>This year, I'd love to do the same, as well as expand my button-making capability to 2.25""-sized versions. Unfortunately, a button press isn't cheap, and neither are the materials for the buttons themselves.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Now for the important parts: What exactly I'm needing, and what you can get in exchange!</p>
<p>I need - </p> <ul> <li>
<b>Goal is met! Thanks, Blutonian! &lt;3 <i>Basic Buttons for RTX 2016</i></b><i> - In order to be able to create enough 1.25"" buttons for all of the Guardians (estimating at 600), I'll need $100 for the button parts, printing the images, and mailing them all out to Austin.</i>
</li> <li>
<b>Goal is met! <i>Expanded Button Line for RTX 2016</i></b><i> - To be able to get the 2.25"" button machine, all of the supplies, print the images and mail them out to Austin, I'll need $500.</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>Goal is met! <i>Fee Overage </i></b><i>- I've got that extra $50 set into the goal to cover whatever fees Indiegogo &amp; the various payment methods will deduct from contributions.</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>Goal is met! <i>Stretch Goal - $800 - Button Bundle </i></b><i>- Outside of the Guardian exclusive buttons, I'd love to be able to design a set of 5 buttons, available for anybody.</i>
</li> <li>
<b>Goal is met! <i>Stretch Goal - $900 - Ghosts of RTX Past - </i></b><i>Reaching this point will allow me to make a set of buttons themed with various memories from all the RTXs that have passed.</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>Goal is met! <i>Stretch Goal - $1000 - New Color Printer </i></b><i>- <strike>In the event that we raise more than the $650 needed to press both 1.25"" and 2.25"" buttons, including mailing costs, </strike>I'll be able to purchase a color printer that will allow me to have full control over all the designs, and will be able to create more buttons!</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>Stretch Goal - $1200 - Team Buttons</b> - Should we get to here, I'll be able to create buttons specialized for each Guardian team.</li> </ul>
<div>You can get - </div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<b>Undying Gratitude </b>- I'll tweet you, friend you, and never stop singing your praises. Really!</li>
<li>
<b>Guaranteed Buttons</b> - I try to leave Guardian buttons at all of the rest spots, and hand them out on request, but there's no way for me to be able to be certain that every Guardian gets a button. Getting them via a perk will keep you from having the play the ""Will she have them on her?"" game.</li>
<li>
<b>Specialized Buttons</b> - The more money I raise, the more button designs I can produce, including a very special ""Thank you!"" button, available only to contributors.</li>
<li>
<b>Custom Button Packages </b>- A limited number of people can pick up a package of buttons in a design of their choosing!</li>
<li>

Last year, I was a Guardian for RTX, a gaming convention put on by Rooster Teeth in Austin, TX.  As a gift to my fellow Guardians, I created a set of 1.25"" buttons, pressed several hundred of them, and gave them out over the weekend.
This year, I'd love to do the same, as well as expand my button-making capability to 2.25""-sized versions. Unfortunately, a button press isn't cheap, and neither are the materials for the buttons themselves.   What I Need & What You Get Now for the important parts: What exactly I'm needing, and what you can get in exchange!
I need -   
Goal is met! Thanks, Blutonian! <3 Basic Buttons for RTX 2016 - In order to be able to create enough 1.25"" buttons for all of the Guardians (estimating at 600), I'll need $100 for the button parts, printing the images, and mailing them all out to Austin.
 
Goal is met! Expanded Button Line for RTX 2016 - To be able to get the 2.25"" button machine, all of the supplies, print the images and mail them out to Austin, I'll need $500.


Goal is met! Fee Overage - I've got that extra $50 set into the goal to cover whatever fees Indiegogo & the various payment methods will deduct from contributions.


Goal is met! Stretch Goal - $800 - Button Bundle - Outside of the Guardian exclusive buttons, I'd love to be able to design a set of 5 buttons, available for anybody.
 
Goal is met! Stretch Goal - $900 - Ghosts of RTX Past - Reaching this point will allow me to make a set of buttons themed with various memories from all the RTXs that have passed.


Goal is met! Stretch Goal - $1000 - New Color Printer - In the event that we raise more than the $650 needed to press both 1.25"" and 2.25"" buttons, including mailing costs, I'll be able to purchase a color printer that will allow me to have full control over all the designs, and will be able to create more buttons!


Stretch Goal - $1200 - Team Buttons - Should we get to here, I'll be able to create buttons specialized for each Guardian team. 
You can get - 


Undying Gratitude - I'll tweet you, friend you, and never stop singing your praises. Really!

Guaranteed Buttons - I try to leave Guardian buttons at all of the rest spots, and hand them out on request, but there's no way for me to be able to be certain that every Guardian gets a button. Getting them via a perk will keep you from having the play the ""Will she have them on her?"" game.

Specialized Buttons - The more money I raise, the more button designs I can produce, including a very special ""Thank you!"" button, available only to contributors.

Custom Button Packages - A limited number of people can pick up a package of buttons in a design of their choosing!

Sweet, Sweet Candy - Don't ask what salted caramels have to do with buttons, just grab yourself a pound of these amazing treats, then laugh at those who weren't able to get some themselves.  Maybe you can share? 
   Why Should You Help? Because buttons are awesome!  By contributing, you'll be helping me bring button goodness to the Guardians at RTX 2016, and at future cons as well.  This is my way of cheering on the Guardians, and it can be your way, too.
    Risks & Challenges Of course, $650 is a lot of money, and I might not raise it all.  If I don't manage to raise at least $600, which is the bare minimum I need to get the 2.25"" press, after fees, I'll still honor all of the perks, replacing 2.25"" buttons with the equivalent in 1.25"" buttons.  I won't be able to purchase the new press, but there will be buttons at RTX either way!
    Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't contribute with cash, you can still help out by:  Getting the word out! Tweet, share, and talk about this with your friends!  There's plenty of tools here on Indiegogo to get you going.
Art me some stuff! As you can see, things are a little blah around here. Send me logos, banners, interpretive dance routines, what have you, and I'll find a place for it on the page! Visit me and cheer me on!  I'll be doing some streams for this, and even dropping me a friendly line will help.

Cubit makes them easy with a single device that brings your design to life.Cubit precisely measures dimensional data of rooms or objects using (2) laser sensors and (1) rolling sensor, then attaches that data to the corresponding image within the app. Cubit is the only device that then guides you to exact point of references in your space based on your designs and measurements.  TUTORIAL DEMO VIDEO | HANG AN EQUALLY SPACED PICTURE No matter if you're hanging a few photos, rearranging a room, moving apartments, or undertaking a full home renovation, Cubit makes it easy for the amateur DIYer or the Interior Design professional to:

LAY OUT ROOMS - Create, re-design, or rearrange the layout of any room by measuring the dimensions of rugs, TVs, sofas, tables, shelves, or plants to organize a new space with items you already own.

DECORATE WALLS - Cubit allows you to hang multiple photos, paintings, and shelves in a virtual world, perfectly spacing your objects on the wall and with each other before you break out the hammer.

HANG PHOTOS OR MOUNT TVS  - Easily lay out a photo display wall with frames of any shape or size. Cubit can even take the precise hanging points on the back of the frame into account to pinpoint the exact spot on your wall to place nails.
CREATE FLOOR PLANS - Measure your furniture and visualize what your room will feel like with precise dimensional data, eliminating the guesswork.
AND MUCH, MUCH MORE  - Cubit is only limited by your imagination! What will you create?
 USING CUBIT IS AS EASY AS: 1. MEASURE 2. DESIGN 3. GUIDE CLICK HERE TO GET YOURS   THE WORLD'S SMARTEST DIY MEASURING & GUIDANCE TOOLFeature loaded engineering helps you virtually create using mixed reality objects within accurate real-world scale.  Cubit At A Glance:   See What The Experts Are SayingCheck out a few recent awards and media reviews of the laser-guided measure of the future.    ""Seeing Cubit was one of those moments at the show [CES] where I felt my heart swell. This is an extraordinary piece of technology that solves real problems for real people.""  -- CARLY KNOBLOCH, CNN, TODAY SHOW & HGTV ""Cubit’s features include real-time, accurate dimensional data from its smart wheel and laser distance measurer that's used app in project planning and layout app""  -- DIGITAL TRENDS ""Plott is translating the freedom of the IoT to devices that simplify complicated tasks...[Cubit] help[s] you measure, plan and execute your design perfectly."" -- BLUETOOTH SIG ""This one impressed me... I've never seen anything like Plott--and that's a good thing!"" -- USA TODAY ""Cubit offers visualization, context, and guidance of dimensional data, displayed in a format the user can understand with minimal measurements and no calculations "" -- VENTURE BEATCLICK HERE FOR OUR PRESS KIT  STEP 1: Measure Any Space or Object with Cubit's Accurate Software With a total of (3) three precision measurement sensors, Cubit removes the complexity of calculating the dimensional data of regular and irregular objects. Accurately calculating the dimensions of any object has never been easier, regardless of shape.With Cubit, you can easily measure anything and save it directly to your smartphone, even attach a photo for later use in the Cubit design studio app. That includes floor plans, rooms, walls, couches, tables, picture frames, TVs, bath tubs, beds, dressers and more. LASER MEASUREMENT SENSORSSimultaneously measure long distances or ""regular objects"" of square or rectangular shape in 2 directions with dual laser distance measuring sensors: one for horizontal and one for vertical.  Cubit's laser measure accurately calculates the dimensions of ""regular shaped objects"" such as rooms, walls, floor-plans with non-moveable objects (cabinets, baths, sinks, etc.) and more.Each laser has the ability to measure a distance up to 100 feet and is rigorously tested and redesigned to ensure accuracy of within 1/8 inch for every 30 feet measured.    CLICK HERE TO GET YOURS   SMART WHEEL MEASUREMENT SENSORFor irregular shapes, Cubit features a rolling rubber dimensioning wheel. To increase accuracy, it is  stabilized with a rubber rolling ball on the underside for smooth gliding on any surface.The dimensioning wheel reduces the number of calculations required to accurately measure ""irregular shaped objects""  such as couches, sculptures, shelves, tables, pictures, or chairs.Cubit's Smart Wheel Measure is accurate to .02% in lab tests to ensure every project is precise.  WIRELESS DATA & IMAGE TRANSMISSIONSDitch the pencil and paper, instantly capture and store data to your smatphone. Cubit wirelessly transmits all measurement data in real time to your smartphone via low-energy Bluetooth. Add a photograph of the object or background you just measured for in-app design.As an added redundancy, the  built-in leveling sensor ensures all initial measurements are accurate in order to later recreate the project you will design. SMART PICTURE HANGING DATATo reduce calculations down the line, Cubit goes one step further when you are measuring picture frames. Upon attaching overall measurements to your image of the picture frame, Cubit prompts you to photograph and select the hanging points on the reverse side. This allows Cubit to calculate your object's exact hang point so you know exactly where to hammer a nail.   CLICK HERE TO GET YOURS   STEP 2: Cubit's App Empowers You To Visualize And Design With EaseAfter measuring your space and your objects, Cubit's accompanying smartphone app allows you to design your space.Lay out your vision in our smartphone app in real scale with real images so every project is perfect before you start hammering nails. VIRTUAL DESIGN CENTERCubit brings your vision to life so you can finally get those photos hung on the wall, commit to the new chair that fits in your apartment's floor plan, or hang new shelving in your kitchen.The design process is a visual one and our app functions as your design center. Integrate photos of your actual space to get the feel for how the final project will look using real world background dimensions. Add features based on their true size, whether that is hanging pictures, cabinets, windows, or painted features. Now you have an accurately scaled visual design that is fully interactive and easily manipulated. MULTIPLE OBJECT SPACINGUpload multiple objects and let Cubit evenly center them for you throughout the entire wall, over a piece of furniture, or in relation to other wall objects.Do your art pieces look best aligned horizontally? Stacked? Centered over the couch? Or with shelves? With Cubit you can adjust with a few simple clicks to find the optimal design. Cubit's virtual designer allows you to test layouts in the app. Simply upload multiple objects, and the app gives you the power to play around with the design. Because accurate measurements are uploaded into the app, you have the ability to center objects horizontally, vertically, and in relation to other objects, like your mounted TV, windows, or your furniture. OPEN DESIGN COMMUNITYShare your designs with other users, and download other designs from a network of preloaded content.Cubit is your partner in design! Once you create your layout you can share with other users, collaborate with your roommate, or convince your significant other that the couch you looked at together really is the perfect fit.The app also features downloadable designs that inspire and revive your space. Simply download the layout in the app and customize with your own photos and wall hangings.   CLICK HERE TO GET YOURS   STEP 3: Cubit's Guidance System Transforms Your Ideas Into A RealityCubit is the first measurement product to not only bring your dimensional data into your smart device, but also bring it back into the real world with guidance.Remove the complexity of home improvement projects by allowing Cubit to apply your virtual design to the real world, indicating exactly where objects should be placed and nails should be hung. GUIDANCE MODEOnce you've finalized your design, Cubit navigates you to the exact points in real life.Switch into 'Guide mode' to bring your design from virtual to reality. Start in the corner of your measured space (wall or floor) and Cubit will indicate with a central arrow the direction you need to move. As you follow the arrow, you will see real time read outs of your point on the background on Cubit's display. Once you've hit your target Cubit will display a bullseye. This will indicate exactly where to place your object, whether that is a nail for your picture or the corner of your couch. LCD SCREEN READOUTSCubit displays real time information that adjusts to your movements.On the central LCD screen, Cubit displays all the necessary information you'll need to create a project, start to finish. Distance is shown in either imperial or metric units,  user's choice. The built in level ensures accuracy. You can also see directional guidance and battery life of your device. PREPARED FOR ANY JOBCubit's durability, accuracy, and longevity make it the perfect multi purpose tool. Housed in ABS plastic, Cubit is designed to be durable, because we know your tools can take a beating on the job. A single charge lasts up to 3,000 readings, so you can complete the entire job. The long lasting battery is charged through a micro USB on the underside of the device.The combination of two pinpoint lasers and rubber wheel make this the most versatile, all-in-one measurement tool that let's you ditch multiple other bulky tools for a single smart device.   CLICK HERE TO GET YOURS   Cubit RewardsWhich reward is right for you?    Cubit Tech SpecificationsWe give you the calculations and opportunity; you make it happen!   Cubit TimelineOur team has been working to constantly refine Cubit, both functionality and design.   Meet The Plott TeamWe are a collective of creatives, engineers, inventors, military veterans, designers and weekend warrior DIYers on a mission to create a way where a DIY project can be less complex, and more fun!  THE TEAMThe Plott team created Cubit as a way to spend our time designing how we want our space to look, or to download inspiration from online content, and then to take that design to life -- without having to be bogged down with a lot of the calculations and measurements.  A way to fully unleash our creativity.Together, we have won 4 awards @ CES, including the coveted “Best of Innovation” award for Smart Home.  We have also been awarded Best of What’s New from Popular Science, nominated for Best Connected Consumer Electronic from Mobile World Congress, won multiple best of innovation awards from ProTools Annual Review, as well as winning award for Best new product hosted by Amazon at the National Hardware Show.",30.0,1,"1 Campaign

Technology is all around us, but what happened to the robots we dreamed of as kids? The ones who could be our friends and members of our family.
The robots who were as smart as our smart phone, but could walk and talk and learn and engage with us, in a way no smart phone ever could.
We think Alpha 2 could finally be that robot, and with your support, we can make Alpha 2 a reality.



Share Dreams, Share the Alpha 2 Campaign.


In a world filled with technology, we have all been looking for something more.
The robots we’ve dreamed of since we were kids could be our friends and members of our family.

At UBTECH, it’s our mission to make these dreams
come true. That’s why we build humanoid robots, like Alpha 2. We have a proven
track record of bringing innovative technologies to market and we also expect
more and more developers to join us for robotic technology innovation.


“The Alpha 2 isn’t just nimble, it’s quite smart as well.” Andrew Tarantola, Engadget
“Unlike some other companion robots set to hit the market, such as Jibo and Buddy, Alpha 2 actually has legs to move around.” Steve Crowe, Robotics Trends
“This friendly little robot will read stories to your kids, and teach you yoga.” Andy Boxall, Digital Trends
“Meet Alpha 2, the humanoid robot that can pretty much do anything around the house.”  Molly Brown, GeekWire
“Alpha 2 has a similar design to many other hobby-class humanoids, but two things stand out: its potential for social interaction, and its extremely low cost.”  Evan Ackerman, IEEE Spectrum

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>At the age of 28, my husband was diagnosed with a stage 3 colon cancer. The chemotherapy left him with horrid neuropathy. During the course of treatment we found he had a blood clotting disorder which caused blood clots in his lungs. His health has continued to fall and he now has fibromyalgia which leaves him frequently unable to walk. He has been falling as he tries to transition from his bed to his wheelchair because our bed is very low to the ground. His doctor  says he needs an andjustable bed with massager to help with the muscle pain and clots. VA covers a lot of things but they do not cover hospital beds unless you are terminal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We are in the process trying to purchase a $6,000 bed from Sealy that is adjustable and has a massage feature to help his legs.</li>
<li>With 4 kids, one being Autistic, we simply don't have this kind of money and need some help.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we were able to get the funding for this bed, my husband would be able to get a good nights sleep again. He would also drastically cut his risk of falling as he tries to transition.</p>
<p>My husband is a great dad but so fequently is so worn out that a bed like this would give him the rest he needs and he'd hopefully have the energy he used to, in order to interact with the kids.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We would greatly apreciate anyone spreading a link to our campaign. Not everyone can contribute and that's ok. We gladly welcome any prayers.</p>

If something goes wrong, many of us know too little about electricity to fix the problem.

<li>Unlike traditional multimeters, Vion consists of a pair of probes without a bulky body, which eliminates hassle. Vion is lightweight and compact.</li>
<li>While existing multimeters require exact proper placement of the rotary switch, Vion's automatic mode measures with the probes, whether you put it on a rotary switch, on an AC switch, or on a resistance switch. </li>
<li>For existing multimeters, if the placement of the probes is off by even a little, the multimeter’s internal circuit board (PCB) may be damaged. Vion, however, is easily manageable, as there is no body or internal circuit board.</li>
<li>The measured values are automatically stored in the app, so you don’t need to manually write them down anywhere. </li>

</div></div>","What People ThinkEverywhere around you, whether at home or work, all energy consuming products utilize electricity. If something goes wrong, many of us know too little about electricity to fix the problem. This is why Vion was born, bringing to you the first smart multimeter that makes it easy to diagnose and fix electrical problems.Most multimeters require you to have the extensive electrical knowledge to understand the number displayed on the LCD in order to determine the fault. However, Vion is linked to the smartphone and automatically measures the product without having to select a measurement item and diagnoses the result as ‘Good/Bad’ through voice guidance.  Vion measures voltage and resistance has a pair of probes without a body and allows you to see the breakdown of electricity-powered products on your smartphone.  
Unlike traditional multimeters, Vion consists of a pair of probes without a bulky body, which eliminates hassle. Vion is lightweight and compact.
While existing multimeters require exact proper placement of the rotary switch, Vion's automatic mode measures with the probes, whether you put it on a rotary switch, on an AC switch, or on a resistance switch. 
For existing multimeters, if the placement of the probes is off by even a little, the multimeter’s internal circuit board (PCB) may be damaged. Vion, however, is easily manageable, as there is no body or internal circuit board.
The measured values are automatically stored in the app, so you don’t need to manually write them down anywhere. 
Multilingual Support/Real-Time Storage  Vion comes with various language guidance options to accommodate your needs.  Your measured values and results can be immediately saved on the smartphone in real-time.

Vion makes it easy to repair household electronics and to check for malfunctions in electric materials like your drones, batteries, electric bikes, washing machines, TVs, and light bulbs.When Vion is placed on the measurement target, the automatic detection function immediately recognizes DC/AC/Resistance, so you don’t have to worry about the risks of damage due to wrong selections.Bluetooth and smartphone connectivity provides you with various measurement functions so you can analyze, diagnose, and fix problems conveniently.  The Bluetooth connectivity allows for automatic/manual mode, various displays, detailed product failure analysis, voice guidance, storage, store connection, and other functions. After connecting for the first time, the connection is secured without having to connect every time.General ModeVion is made for everyone. So, if you are unfamiliar with electrical/technical knowledge, you can opt to use the automatic mode. Expert ModeVion not only measures resistance and voltage but also capacitor/inductor/diode.When you find that there is a stripped wire, the existing multimeter measures the measurement item with AC voltage. If AC voltage cannot be detected, measure it again as DC voltage. If DC voltage does not appear, select it as resistance. Vion can detect the state of the wire by measuring just once.Vion automatically detects the measurement target product by displaying the status of the product versus the measurement. This clearly outlines the voltage reference for each measurement target.Even when your smartphone is in your pocket, measurement results are delivered through voice guidance. This removes the risk of any sudden movement when attempting to measure objects and allows you to see the results simultaneously, making it possible to complete tasks that require more than one hand. A pair of probed Vion meters is small enough to fit snugly in your pocket and perfectly in your toolbox. In addition, the protection case enhances user convenience and can easily be stored with measurement aids.Vion automatically saves measured values by date/time and facilitates management of a large number of measurement objects, relieving the trouble of re-measuring items.The voice guidance feature is supported by multiple languages: English, Spanish, French, Japanese (Chinese and Korean are currently in progress)Manuals on measured products are presented by images to diagnose the fault, and this provides general users with a comprehensive guide on the measured products.The Vion app can connect directly to the store for purchases of measured products, reducing other unnecessary purchases and costs.                               Multimeters are fundamental instruments in the field of electricity and engineering. Overtime, with the increase use of electronics and electrical products, the multimeter has become widely utilized. The multimeter often requires expertise or knowledge for usability, which can cause general users to use them incorrectly, break them, and repeat the unnecessary cycle of purchasing more multimeters.

What are the fees?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, Prepdeck is available to ship anywhere in the world. When you back our campaign, simply select your country and the corresponding shipping price will be listed. We've done our very best to keep shipping prices down, but Prepdeck is not a small item, so this is a big factor. Note purchasing any multipack option does lower the per unit shipping price.</p><p><strong>Q: Is Prepdeck dishwasher safe?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes! We don't recommend putting the Prepdeck body in the dishwasher (although it can), rather we recommend rinsing with warm water and mild soap in the sink or wiped down in place on the counter.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use the containers in the freezer or the Microwave?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. Our containers are made from premium Tritan plastic and are rated for use in both the freezer and microwave.</p><p><strong>Q: Does Prepdeck fit in the fridge?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Well, it depends on the size of your fridge! It certainly could! We designed Prepdeck to be flexible, so all the container are removable and since they include lids, and stack nicely, it's easy to store prepped ingredients or leftovers in the fridge with or without the entire system.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I choose which accessories are included in Prepdeck?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Each Prepdeck systems comes fully loaded with over 35 features and accessories, standard. If you wish to add accessories or containers, you can do so via the add on menu.</p><p><strong>Q: Are the containers spill proof?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, when the lid is securely in place.</p><p><strong>Q: Where do I select my colors?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Prepdeck ships standard in Glacier White which includes the white Prepdeck, cool grey accessories and a White Marble cutting board/enclosure.

These issues can quickly make cooking feel frustrating, overwhelming, and a lot like a chore.There are plenty of kitchen accessories, but they all solve only a singular issue. There is no all-encompassing solution to help you prepare, measure, and store your food for minimal clean up and efficiency as you cook.       Prepdeck contains over forty-five high quality accessories into one sleek and organized system that allows you to stay tidy and organized as you prepare your meals, leaving you with less to clean up and less to stress about. A cluttered kitchen can be overwhelming. With Prepdeck, every tool you need is right in front of you.Effortlessly follow your favorite recipe or cooking show with the sleek table stand that sits elegantly behind the Prepdeck. Drop your worry and focus on what matters: Preparing a beautiful meal and having fun doing it!  With a sleek, minimalist design, and a variety of colorways, Prepdeck is meant to not only keep you organized and stress-free, but to enhance the beauty of any kitchen, big or small.               The Prepdeck enclosure doubles as a sizable cutting board, allowing for faster, more organized prep-time. It’s magnetic and is removable for easy cleaning.                         Prepdeck is not just for cooking in the moment. Prepdeck containers can also be stored in the fridge for those who love to prepare their meals ahead of time.   We created Prepdeck because we were tired of feeling overwhelmed in the kitchen. We knew there had to be a better way than messy drawers, dirty counters, and never ending prep time. We believe that there is so much joy to be had when cooking meals for yourself, with family, and with friends.  Cooking should not have to feel like a chore, and with Prepdeck, it doesn’t.Regardless of your kitchen size, cooking expertise, or the time you have to cook, Prepdeck is for you, helping you stay organized, efficient, and happy in your kitchen.  You can add on additional board choices via the add on menu. You will make your final board choice(s) once the campaign has ended.     If you're interested in purchasing 10-100 Prepdecks for business or wholesale, please contact us at hello@prepdeck.com and we’ll be glad to assist you. To purchase add-ons, simply back them separately from your Prepdeck.      Some of life’s most special moments start in the kitchen… creating delicious meals for loved ones, sticking to a diet that helps you accomplish your goals, or sharing time with family and friends around the dinner table. But busy schedules, and endless demands, can quickly turn cooking into a daunting task that feels like a chore.After experiencing this frustration first hand, Alexander Eburne took pen to paper, leaning on his 10+ years of experience developing and bringing products to market, to create Prepdeck.With a year and a half of hard work, countless iterations, feedback, testing, prototyping and refining, now behind us, Prepdeck is ready to become a reality, and your pledge is a big part of making that happen. With your help, we can move from prototypes to production, and we’ll be well on our way to helping bring back the joy of cooking, with Prepdeck.        Q: Do you ship internationally? What are the fees?A: Yes, Prepdeck is available to ship anywhere in the world. When you back our campaign, simply select your country and the corresponding shipping price will be listed. We've done our very best to keep shipping prices down, but Prepdeck is not a small item, so this is a big factor. Note purchasing any multipack option does lower the per unit shipping price.Q: Is Prepdeck dishwasher safe?A:  Yes! We don't recommend putting the Prepdeck body in the dishwasher (although it can), rather we recommend rinsing with warm water and mild soap in the sink or wiped down in place on the counter.Q: Can I use the containers in the freezer or the Microwave?A: Yes. Our containers are made from premium Tritan plastic and are rated for use in both the freezer and microwave.Q: Does Prepdeck fit in the fridge?A: Well, it depends on the size of your fridge! It certainly could! We designed Prepdeck to be flexible, so all the container are removable and since they include lids, and stack nicely, it's easy to store prepped ingredients or leftovers in the fridge with or without the entire system.Q: Can I choose which accessories are included in Prepdeck?A: Each Prepdeck systems comes fully loaded with over 35 features and accessories, standard. If you wish to add accessories or containers, you can do so via the add on menu.Q: Are the containers spill proof?A: Yes, when the lid is securely in place.Q: Where do I select my colors?A: Prepdeck ships standard in Glacier White which includes the white Prepdeck, cool grey accessories and a White Marble cutting board/enclosure. There is also a range of board options available which can be ordered via the add-on menu. All color options can be selected after the campaign ends.Q: How does the add-on menu work?A: Each item listed in the add-on menu is available to you, and there is no limit to the number of times you select an item. Indiegogo considers each perk a separate transaction, so depending on how you plan to purchase, you may need to process multiple transactions. Q: What is the warranty?A: For your peace of mind, Prepdeck purchases made during our campaign are guaranteed against manufacturing defects for a period of 1 year from the date of purchase.

</div></div>","WayCap capsules are compatible with Nespresso®  machines and solve the waste production problem present with disposable pods, because they can be reused as many times as you like. 
Moreover you can save up to 85% on disposable espresso pods, as they work with any coffee blend on the market.




 

 
With WayCap capsules, you can finally kiss goodbye to the millions of disposable espresso capsules that accumulate in landfills, to huge amounts of packaging, and to the tons of carbon dioxide generated for the production and distribution of the pods worldwide.



WayCap is Ecological
 

Thanks to WayCap compatible and reusable capsuless, a family of four can save more than 1,000 Euro per year, without sacrificing the taste of a fabulous cup of home-brewed espresso 
 


WayCap works with any blend on the market, but also gives the ability to create your own personal blend. Taking advantage of the possibility of purchasing coffee from all sorts of different places, from the coffee merchant next door to the supermarket and from the organic foods shop to your favorite local café, you can save up to 85% compared to the average cost of traditional disposable capsules.
Finally, you can be in command of your own choices once again.
 

WayCap is also highly practical. Thanks to the dispenser provided, you’ll be able to refill your pods in less than 30 seconds.
Its unique shape has been perfected to allow for easy and quick refilling of the pod with powdered coffee without making a mess and with the ability to use a uniform pressure, thanks to the handy coffee press.
Take a look to the video below to understand how:

 
The dispenser allows you to bring your favorite pod with you and enjoy the taste of your coffee wherever you are. Take a look how:  
 




 

 The unique shape of the exit system “by slot” together with the arrangement of holes through which the water flows, allows you to obtain a perfect espresso with the vast majority of the blends on the market.

Patent Application Pending
 After countless tests performed over a period of almost two years, we determined the correct number, shape, and distribution of the exit slots and the entrance holes that allow the water to flow inside the pod in the same way as in a traditional espresso.

<p>Please volunteer to help build the <b>core</b> of the new Old Stone House community oven, fireplace, and hearth from start to finish. In the process you'll learn about masonry and brick oven construction from professional oven mason Pat Manley.</p>
<p><b>This is now a FREE volunteer opportunity </b>thanks to successful fund-raising! </p>
<p><b>No prior masonry experience needed.</b></p>
<p>We're building the core of the oven from Wednesday, April 27, through Monday, May 2.</p>

<p>Different stages of the process will occur on different days, including: groundwork, the base slab, framing the door and arch, laying the door and arch, oven insulation, and facing. We'll also be laying the fireplace and hearth. You'll get to work on different parts of the process depending on which days you attend.</p>
<p>You should plan to wear closed-toe shoes -- wear boots if possible -- and bring work gloves and a bottle of water. We'll provide snacks! This is an all-day event, so you should plan to bring lunch, or you can get lunch from one of the great local shops and restaurants around the park.</p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>For an outdoor construction project there's always the risk of bad weather. To mitigate this risk, the Old Stone House has portable tents that we can set up over the construction site, enabling us to keep working.</p>
<p>The biggest risk is that we won't raise enough money to fund the cost of rebuilding the oven.  If that happens, we'll have to push off the oven construction until the fall or next year, or cancel the project entirely.</p>
<p>If we have to cancel the project, the money donated to this campaign will go to the Old Stone House and pay for firewood for the existing oven, a possible oven reinforcement and structural improvement project, and other educational programs at the Old Stone House.</p>

<h3>About Brick Oven Brooklyn</h3>
<p>In 2012, Jace and Yasmin Harker (the co-founders of Brick Oven Brooklyn) learned about the long history of communal brick ovens while on vacation in the Brittany region of France. In centuries past, it was too expensive for individuals to each have their own oven, so a village would have one large communal wood-fired oven. Several times a week, the oven would be fired and everyone from the community would gather at the oven to bake their bread.</p>
<p>We were inspired by the vision of bringing people together around a shared hearth, so when we returned to Brooklyn, we looked for a brick oven that hosted public events. The Old Stone House had a small but beautiful outdoor oven and invited us to use it, and that was the beginning of our monthly Open Community Baking Day!</p>
<p>In 2014 we started the Brick Oven Brooklyn meetup group to help coordinate and plan the oven days, and it's been taking off ever since! Now we're at nearly 400 members and growing. We recently launched Build Your Own Pizza days. If you love the idea of building community through cooking, come join us!</p>

</div></div>","Help build a better oven!We're rebuilding the community oven at the Old Stone House!The outdoor wood-fired oven and hearth at the Old Stone House was built ten years ago by a local Boy Scout troop. The community uses it regularly for historical cooking classes and Brick Oven Brooklyn's increasingly popular Build Your Own Pizza and Community Open Baking days. We fire up the oven, and anyone and everyone is invited to gather round the fire, cook your own food, and partake!We would love to expand these programs at the Old Stone House. With a larger oven and fireplace we can host:

Baking classes and field trips for local schools and the community


More and larger Community Open Baking and Build Your Own Pizza days


Historical cooking classes, demonstrations, and re-enactments


Weddings, birthday parties, and other events

With your help, we can rebuild the oven and hearth on the same site as the current oven.Properly built, insulated, and roofed, the rebuilt oven will serve Park Slope/Gowanus and the whole New York City community for generations to come!How can I help?Please donate to the campaign! You can donate any amount of money you choose, and optionally donate a perk. See below for a description of some of the perks.Just as important, you can volunteer your time to help build the oven!
Volunteer Community Oven Construction with mason Pat Manley


Please volunteer to help build the core of the new Old Stone House community oven, fireplace, and hearth from start to finish. In the process you'll learn about masonry and brick oven construction from professional oven mason Pat Manley.
This is now a FREE volunteer opportunity thanks to successful fund-raising! 
No prior masonry experience needed.
We're building the core of the oven from Wednesday, April 27, through Monday, May 2.
To sign up, please visit the Brick Oven Brooklyn Meetup page and RSVP for one or more days. Space is limited because only 8 people can work on the oven efficiently at once. So if you RSVP ""yes"" and then can't make it, please change your RSVP to ""no"" so someone else can get a spot. 
Please volunteer for as many (or as few) days as you can make it, on any combination of days. The more you help, the more you'll learn!
Every day you'll get to: 



Participate in building the core of the oven and hearth


Learn about materials, masonry techniques, and oven engineering


Ask lots of questions and take photos of the process


Learn from Pat's over twenty years of oven-building experience


Hang out with Pat over beer in the evenings


Different stages of the process will occur on different days, including: groundwork, the base slab, framing the door and arch, laying the door and arch, oven insulation, and facing. We'll also be laying the fireplace and hearth. You'll get to work on different parts of the process depending on which days you attend.
You should plan to wear closed-toe shoes -- wear boots if possible -- and bring work gloves and a bottle of water. We'll provide snacks! This is an all-day event, so you should plan to bring lunch, or you can get lunch from one of the great local shops and restaurants around the park.
About the Mason
Pat has over twenty years of experience building brick ovens for restaurants, bakeries, vineyards, and backyards all over the country, and has taught dozens of oven-building workshops to beginners and professionals. And every year Pat leads Masons on a Mission to build masonry stoves in Guatemala. 
Whether you want to build your own backyard oven, or work in a bakery, or just want to learn a new skill, this is a great learning opportunity!
If you have questions about the project, write to Jace at BrickOvenBrooklyn@gmail.com. 
See you soon!
What's already done?Much of the planning and design is already accomplished!

Professional mason J. Patrick Manley from Maine will lead the construction team. Pat has over 20 years experience building wood-fired brick ovens.


We have a finished design and blueprints for a rebuilt oven and fireplace. The design has been reviewed for engineering and suitability for the space and use cases, and is historically period-appropriate.


Labor for key parts of construction will be volunteers from local Boy Scout Troop 310, led by Eagle Scout candidate Andrew Sapini.







When will it be built?The construction schedule is set: Pat arrives on April 26, 2016, and core oven construction will be from April 27 through May 3, when Pat leaves.Our volunteer team and local volunteers will finish the oven's outer brick facing over several weekends in May.That's pretty soon, so we're on a tight schedule to finish raising funds!Where will the money go?The bulk of the funds we raise will pay for construction materials and Pat's time and housing during the week he's on-site leading the oven construction. Construction materials needed include:

Over 2500 bricks for the external facing


Special firebrick for inside the oven and fireplace


Modern insulation to improve the oven's efficiency and usefulness


Concrete, mortar, rebar, and other construction materials


Handmade door and damper for the oven


Cast-iron fireplace cranes (used for suspending pots over a cooking fire)

Metal roof to make the oven and fireplace weather resistant, preserving them for generations to come.
Some funds will, of course, also cover the materials costs for campaign perks like t-shirts and bread.Let's beat the goal!We'd love to raise more than our goal! Extra money will help us establish free oven-centric educational programs for area children, local schools, and the community, and bring in noted historians and local chefs for cooking classes and demonstrations. Some possible topics include:

Colonial-era cooking


How to bake your own bread


The daily life of a Dutch farmer in Brooklyn

Extra money will go towards the firewood fund, and will support general educational programs at the Old Stone House.RewardsIf you donate to the campaign, we'll engrave your name on a brass dedication plaque that will be mounted on the oven itself. Everyone who visits the oven will know that you helped support it!Depending on donation level, you will be a Friend, Keeper, Steward, Builder, or Patron of the Oven.In addition to that, we and the community are offering lots of cool perks for different donation levels.

Connected to the internet, it allows the entire family to care for their home anywhere and anytime with just a tablet or smartphone.As soon as it detects activity, Hi) sends a push notification. The monitoring function enables you to remotely access the camera and trigger the alarm of the device if you notice an unsavory character or something disturbing happening at your doorstep.Most of the time, a burglar will simply ring your doorbell to know if you're here. Make sure they know they’re on camera by speaking with them thanks to our crystal clear microphone. Since most thieves enter the home through the front door, just trigger the alarm and watch those thieves run fast! It offers two-way voice communication, as well as one-way video to let you see who’s at the door while talking to them. When a visitor presses your doorbell, it rings the app on the smartphones of each member of the family. You get a preview of who’s there and you can answer directly or let another member of the family take the call if you are busy.With Hi) there's always someone home!With Hi) you need never worry about missing an important delivery or visit anymore. You will always be available, via smartphone, to welcome and give instructions to the delivery man.We worked for two solid months to minimize the delay between the moment someone rings your doorbell and the call is received on your smartphone. We feel your visitors should never wait too long in front of a closed door.Hi) identifies and recognizes family members when they approach the front door of the family home. From there it can talk to your other internet-connected appliances: unlocking the door, turning on the lights, playing your “coming home” playlist from Spotify…  You only need your fingerprint (where available) on your Android or iOS phone.  Have peace of mind and know your family have made it home safe while you’re away. If Hi) is connected to an electric lock not only can you see and speak to your visitor but you can also open the door from your smartphone.  Hi) can even turn on the lights or open the blinds remotely, it’s up to you to decide when configuring the system as the device has two programmable functions..""Keeping a watchful eye on your house, Hi) let you see who is on your doorstep and communicate with your visitors remotely"" Today show, Jan 10th""French Tech company Fenotek, is launching Hi), a digital butler that puts a friendly face (or interface) on the category which could persuade consumers to buy in to the smart home with slightly more gusto"". WGSN Insider, Dec 22th""Hi) is a video doorbell by Fenotek that can also be used to turn lights on in your home and monitor its safety"". Huffington Post, Feb 2nd You spend a tremendous amount of money enhancing your home and its design. Why would you put the ugliest object in the world at your front door?Hi) is a sleek, eye-appealing device that will nicely enhance the décor of your doorway. The fluid design is inspired from the Streamline trend which was in vogue in the 1930s and is making a popular comeback thanks to the aerodynamic pure-line concept. At the time, Streamlining was associated with prosperity and an exciting future. We feel this is true now as it was back then.Every project comes with risk. However thanks to our experienced team, Fenotek has initiated a careful approach to mitigate all risks; technical, financial and logistical to make sure we've done everything possible to deliver Hi) to all of our backers on time and within budget. From a technical standpoint, Hi) is based on existing proven technologies (wifi, video, 3G, etc.). Therefore the development is focused on their integration into one single device, an easy-to-use user interface and appropriate backendinfrastructure. No less than 8 prototypes were designed and manufactured in a step by step approach to demonstrate capabilities and secure performances in the pursuit of the best possible final design.This result is an outstanding product with unmatched performances and features with no direct competitors as demonstrated during the latest CES in Las Vegas in January 2016.Meanwhile, industrialization of production remains a key factor of success; therefore sourcing solutions for pre-series and serial production are already identified and currently being evaluated. Glitches in component sourcing may lead to a delay of no more than a few weeks. At this moment, we have already secured our components and selected a partner to manufacture the first series of 2000 units, including the ones that will be ordered on Indiegogo!Hi) connects to your home Wi-Fi network or to 3G+ mobile broadband and sends real-time notifications to your smartphone or tablet when someone is at your door. Using our free Hi) App (which is available for Android and iOS) you can see an HD video stream of the visitors and speak to them using two-way audio communication. Hi) can alert you when motion is detected in front of your door so that you can activate the camera from your smartphone. Hi) offers the capability of opening the door via the smartphone or activates any AC 110v-230c devices such as a lamp or electrical blinds.

MowRo is schedulable, silent, incredibly efficient, and takes you mere minutes to set up!MowRo runs on schedule every other day or night — finely cutting your grass to help fertilize the lawn naturally.MowRo runs on schedule every other day or night. A low profile, no-trip perimeter wire is placed according to the needs of your lawn. The wire acts as a wall so MowRo knows when to turn and maneuver around the lawn. The perimeter wire also acts as a guide taking MowRo back to the docking station for charging. MowRo operates using an algorithm that helps maintain a consistent lawn. MowRo continuously mows day or night ensuring your lawn is pristinely kept and mows up to 6,500 sq ft per mow cycle. Program your yard size into MowRo, and the algorithm does the rest.The docking station acts as a home base that MowRo charges at. When it begins to rain, when MowRo finishes mowing or if MowRo becomes low on battery, it will automatically return to this docking station. When it comes to design, safety is the first priority. Live stress and worry free when it comes to the safety of you and your family while MowRo is running.The blades are housed inside a protective Mowing Blade Guard, this allows grass to pass through while protecting pets and children.The MowRo has multiple safety sensors that will cause it to reverse or stop the blades if it comes into contact with objects or is lifted off the ground.Traditional mowers act as an alarm clock for the entire neighborhood, everyone within a two block radius knows you’re mowing your lawn. MowRo’s electric motor is nearly silent, so silent you may not even notice it grooming away at your lawn on a sunny Saturday morning.  Normal lawnmowers roar at around 90db — that's loud enough to rupture your ear drums!! MowRo is 30x quieter and is as quiet as an electric toothbrush or a calm suburb.You can even run MowRo at night, be undisturbed and have the day to enjoy the lawn. MowRo’s simple user interface makes it easy for fas, no-fuss mow schedule programming. No complicated buttons and functions, the interface saves you even more time and reduces the mental workload. Just set it and forget it!Using the docking station and perimeter wire, MowRo is entirely autonomous. With the auto-return function MowRo will return to the docking station if it is low on battery, if it begins raining, or when it is done with the scheduled mow. MowRo is completely electric and uses a high-quality Samsung™ 28V 2Ah lithium-ion rechargeable battery. It's nearly silent and does not emit exhaust, fumes, or harmful greenhouse gases. Best of all, MowRo eliminates fuel costs and spills.The quality of MowRo is second to none. MowRo gives your lawn a “golf fair-way” or “carpet-like” look.The key to MowRo’s efficiency is that it maintains your grass by taking off a little bit every other day. This ultimately improves the health of your lawn. It achieves this by only cutting a fraction of an inch off your grass each time it cuts. Those little clippings then biodegrade into a natural fertilizer!​Sharp blades are necessary for a nice-looking lawn. Mowing with dull blades causes ragged cuts that turns the tips of grass blades brown. Cutting grass with sharp blades promotes growth and a healthy good looking lawn. Your MowRo comes with extra blades that are easily replaced with a simple screwdriver.The height of MowRo’s blades adjust from 0.8”-2.4” giving you the ability to personalize the look to your lawn.

This means cleaning, storing, sharpening and, most importantly, using the knife properly.</p><p>Any and all knives wear over time and is an inevitability as its edge wears down mostly due to abrasion. Our knives are sharpened to a 15 degree angle which when completed, creates a fantastically sharp blade, but with that comes an incredibly thin piece of steel withstanding all of the pressure and weight when in use. All knives, no matter the cost, will require proper maintenance to maximise their effectiveness in the kitchen and this should be expected when purchasing any kitchen knife.</p><p>Some things to consider:<br/><br/><strong>Cleaning</strong>: Our knives are hand-made using two materials; steel and wood. Steel is far more capable when it comes to withstanding pressure, heat, water etc. Although the wood we use is durable, we ask that particular care be taken when cleaning each knife so as not to damage and degrade the handle as this naturally wears quicker and is more susceptible to the elements. To do this we recommend not using a dishwasher and to clean the knife by hand, after which promptly drying with a dishcloth. Please appreciate that wood is an organic product and should be cared for appropriately.<br/><br/><strong>Storing</strong>: There are multiple reasons for properly storing your knives; to prevent unnecessary damage to the knife itself, to prevent the risk of injury, and to help create suitable access for when it is needed. We recommend these 3 options as suitable ways to store your knives.</p><p>Firstly, probably the most obvious one, a knife block. This allows for safe storing of your knives as the blades will be concealed whilst providing easy access to each handle, in addition to keeping them separate from other utensils within your kitchen.</p><p>Secondly, an alternative to the above would be a magnetic knife rack/holder. This provides both the benefit of keeping your knives away from other utensils with easy access to each handle. Each knife is never in contact with another and can be seen fully at all times.</p><p>Our third recommendation, should neither of the two above agree with you, would be to at the very least use a blade guard. These simply slide onto each blade and act as a barrier between the knife and other utensils. This option also helps prevent the risk of injury and would suit anyone not wishing to fully display their knives for reasons such as having young children around.<br/><br/><strong>Sharpening</strong>: No matter how little or often you use your knife, there will come a time when the cutting edge will have noticeably worn and result in a less efficient tool in your kitchen. There are many diy solutions out there, and most offer very simple procedures to achieve a sharp blade. Should you wish to have a go yourself, we recommend using a sharpening blade-guide paired with a whetstone, as if done correctly, creates a far superior result. There are plenty of resources out there both showing how it's done and explaining the requirements and benefits. We may in the future offer an in-house sharpening solution although is not something currently on offer.</p><p><strong>Using your knife</strong>: There are many factors which relate to the proper use surrounding the do's and don'ts of using a kitchen knife. We certainly can't name them all here however, to us, there are some that stand out amongst the crowd.<br/>      Please do not attempt to cut bones, frozen foods (or similar) or proceed to apply great pressure on the knife to forcefully make a cut. A knife should be guided and held securely to allow the blade to successfully do its job. Should there at any stage be more resistance than expected when attempting to cut, slice etc, please check for signs of wear on the blade and re-evaluate the required action.</p><p>Please use proper etiquette when holding a knife and make sure to have a secure, firm grip to maximise control when in use. Pay attention to the task and make sure to place any object on a solid, stable surface (ideally a wooden chopping board), and to keep any object secure to help prevent the risk of the blade slipping when attempting to cut.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Should you have any further questions or queries surrounding this campaign, please do not hesitate to contact us and we shall do our very best to get back to you.</strong></p><p><strong>Thank you for your interest.</strong></p><p><strong>G.

This means cleaning, storing, sharpening and, most importantly, using the knife properly.Any and all knives wear over time and is an inevitability as its edge wears down mostly due to abrasion. Our knives are sharpened to a 15 degree angle which when completed, creates a fantastically sharp blade, but with that comes an incredibly thin piece of steel withstanding all of the pressure and weight when in use. All knives, no matter the cost, will require proper maintenance to maximise their effectiveness in the kitchen and this should be expected when purchasing any kitchen knife.Some things to consider:Cleaning: Our knives are hand-made using two materials; steel and wood. Steel is far more capable when it comes to withstanding pressure, heat, water etc. Although the wood we use is durable, we ask that particular care be taken when cleaning each knife so as not to damage and degrade the handle as this naturally wears quicker and is more susceptible to the elements. To do this we recommend not using a dishwasher and to clean the knife by hand, after which promptly drying with a dishcloth. Please appreciate that wood is an organic product and should be cared for appropriately.Storing: There are multiple reasons for properly storing your knives; to prevent unnecessary damage to the knife itself, to prevent the risk of injury, and to help create suitable access for when it is needed. We recommend these 3 options as suitable ways to store your knives.Firstly, probably the most obvious one, a knife block. This allows for safe storing of your knives as the blades will be concealed whilst providing easy access to each handle, in addition to keeping them separate from other utensils within your kitchen.Secondly, an alternative to the above would be a magnetic knife rack/holder. This provides both the benefit of keeping your knives away from other utensils with easy access to each handle. Each knife is never in contact with another and can be seen fully at all times.Our third recommendation, should neither of the two above agree with you, would be to at the very least use a blade guard. These simply slide onto each blade and act as a barrier between the knife and other utensils. This option also helps prevent the risk of injury and would suit anyone not wishing to fully display their knives for reasons such as having young children around.Sharpening: No matter how little or often you use your knife, there will come a time when the cutting edge will have noticeably worn and result in a less efficient tool in your kitchen. There are many diy solutions out there, and most offer very simple procedures to achieve a sharp blade. Should you wish to have a go yourself, we recommend using a sharpening blade-guide paired with a whetstone, as if done correctly, creates a far superior result. There are plenty of resources out there both showing how it's done and explaining the requirements and benefits. We may in the future offer an in-house sharpening solution although is not something currently on offer.Using your knife: There are many factors which relate to the proper use surrounding the do's and don'ts of using a kitchen knife. We certainly can't name them all here however, to us, there are some that stand out amongst the crowd.      Please do not attempt to cut bones, frozen foods (or similar) or proceed to apply great pressure on the knife to forcefully make a cut. A knife should be guided and held securely to allow the blade to successfully do its job. Should there at any stage be more resistance than expected when attempting to cut, slice etc, please check for signs of wear on the blade and re-evaluate the required action.Please use proper etiquette when holding a knife and make sure to have a secure, firm grip to maximise control when in use. Pay attention to the task and make sure to place any object on a solid, stable surface (ideally a wooden chopping board), and to keep any object secure to help prevent the risk of the blade slipping when attempting to cut.Should you have any further questions or queries surrounding this campaign, please do not hesitate to contact us and we shall do our very best to get back to you.Thank you for your interest.G.

My name is Ranee Hanlon However  I am best known as 'Lady A Broad' an internationally published and awarded Pinup model. At home I am a mother, Graphic designer, vintage lover of the 1940/1950 and cursed with a creative mind.</p>
<p>I recently organised a High Tea fun raising event for a close friends mother who has Motor Neuron disease. It got me thinking about the extravagance and amazing decor the 1950's era provided for a High Tea. I have been looking for place mats and coasters to adorn my lovely vintage dinning table for many years yet haven't found anything that would compliment it. Combine the 1950's design with modern functionality. I want to create a set of coasters, a serving tray, tea towel and recipe/tip cards that have a soft vintage design. For the older generation to remember and younger generation to learn about. When not in use, the coasters can be used as an educational tool or presented in the serving tray as a centre piece on your table, at the ready for when friends drop by. In time place mats and a tea box will extend this gorgeous set. </p>
<p>I have had this idea amongst many others, Like a headache with pictures.  but this one will not go away. I know I need to make these home wares for it has been my passion for many years. I have been creating vintage inspired fridge magnets, broaches and earrings to try and earn some extra money to fund this project. I have been unable to achieve this utilising my current resources.</p>
<p>Every person that has seen my first set of  coasters  has loved my idea  and want to buy the prototypes for themselves and as gifts for family and friends. The only trouble is that they are incredibly labour intensive at the moment as everything is done by hand the long way with very tired hand tools and good old fashioned elbow grease. Now I am not afraid of hard work, however there is only a reasonable amount of time before theses wares become slave labour and very much running at a loss, as the price cannot match the time put in.</p>
<p>I am here to ask for your help for new equipment to replace the old and dangerous equipment that I have and to purchase other pieces that will remove several very long laborious tasks making the process faster and safer also giving me more diversity to create new kitchen wares to add to my range.</p>
<p>The Items I need to improve and help share my home wares are:</p>
<p>A laser cutter. An air compressor. spray gun. spray booth. laminator. colour laser printer. tea towel/ napkin printing and manufacturing. I will also need to look into printing costs for packaging.</p>
<p>My aim is to get my product out as soon as possible to capture a niche market in the Vintage/Rockabilly/retro industry. Having being part of these fantastic weekend events I see what is popular and sells. My advantage is that I have a graphic design background and think outside the square. I know that this will cause excitement among the vintage lovers and high end beautique shops alike.</p>
<p>The end product will be wood finished with a clear 2 pack varnish. A high quality product that will stand alone as an attractive centre pieces on your table. </p>
<p>Your help in funding this project will bring my ideas to life. Any money received with go to my first priority, the laser cutter worth $3,000. It can help me expand my goals and keep creating unique home wares. There are a lot of companies that do kitchen wares,but what they lack is the home made touch. The personal, soft touch that my design style has. My funding friends, you will see what I mean when you receive some yourself.</p>

<i>ULTRA-LUXURIOUS HEALTHY bed sheets that STAY on your bed and ENHANCE your sleep!</i><br/> </h3>
<p><strong>ULTRA-LUXURIOUS:</strong><br/>DeBora Rachelle bed sheets help regulate your body temperature - keeping you cool when you need it and warm when you don't.  HOW? We use extra long staple cotton that is hand-picked and single-ply. Such fine cotton is also, softer, more luxurious and durable.</p>
<p><strong>HEALTHY</strong><br/><i>SEVENTY percent</i> of manufacturers use harmful chemicals in their bed sheets and the US government has no regulations on what manufacturers put into their sheets. DeBora Rachelle bed sheets are OEKO-Tex tested, cruelty-free, and hypoallergenic. DeBora Rachelle bed sheets contain no harmful chemicals that can harm your family or you!</p>
<p><strong>STAY ON</strong><br/>DeBora Rachelle bed sheets have a new patented design that makes it easier to make your bed (no having to lift your mattress to try to get that last corner on) and they stay on!<br/><br/>1 - place long straps by the headboard (this way you know what side of the sheet is the headboard side). And put the fitted sheet and it's elastic around the bottom in place like a typical bed sheet.<br/><br/>2 - WITHOUT LIFTING your mattress, simply glide the slippery strap under the mattress to the opposite corner. </p>
<p>3 - Feel for the loop with your hand and run the strap through the loop and fold back onto itself with the Velcro closure. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527709261/m4pins81l0xwg8tlgk7c.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>4 - next put on the top sheet with the Velcro straps at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>SPECIFICS:</p>
<p>Have you ever woken up at night with the sweats? Managing your body temperature is an important part of getting a good night's sleep. DeBora Rachelle luxury bed sheets are made of <strong>EXTRA LONG SINGLE-PLY STAPLE</strong> cotton which allows air flow circulation and moisture absorption. Our natural fibers draw moisture away from your skin to help prohibit you from waking up drenched in sweat during the night.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527710153/do4m5qi9zoxratm5znbs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>DEBORA RACHELLE LUXURY BED SHEETS ARE SINGLE-PLY  </strong></p>
<p>The ply of cotton fabric is much more important than the thread count. Thread count cannot exceed approximately 413 threads without the threads being manipulated in some way by twisting the life out of them with other threads. Once you start to twist threads together, it suffocates the airflow movement making the fabric less breathable, less durable and prone to pilling.

</div></div>","ULTRA-LUXURIOUS HEALTHY bed sheets that STAY on your bed and ENHANCE your sleep! 
ULTRA-LUXURIOUS:DeBora Rachelle bed sheets help regulate your body temperature - keeping you cool when you need it and warm when you don't.  HOW? We use extra long staple cotton that is hand-picked and single-ply. Such fine cotton is also, softer, more luxurious and durable.
HEALTHYSEVENTY percent of manufacturers use harmful chemicals in their bed sheets and the US government has no regulations on what manufacturers put into their sheets. DeBora Rachelle bed sheets are OEKO-Tex tested, cruelty-free, and hypoallergenic. DeBora Rachelle bed sheets contain no harmful chemicals that can harm your family or you!
STAY ONDeBora Rachelle bed sheets have a new patented design that makes it easier to make your bed (no having to lift your mattress to try to get that last corner on) and they stay on!1 - place long straps by the headboard (this way you know what side of the sheet is the headboard side). And put the fitted sheet and it's elastic around the bottom in place like a typical bed sheet.2 - WITHOUT LIFTING your mattress, simply glide the slippery strap under the mattress to the opposite corner. 
3 - Feel for the loop with your hand and run the strap through the loop and fold back onto itself with the Velcro closure. 4 - next put on the top sheet with the Velcro straps at the foot of the bed.
5 - without lifting the mattress, feel for the bottom sheet loop and run the top sheet strap through the loop and fold back onto itself with Velcro.

ENHANCE your sleep* DeBora Rachelle bed sheets stay on so you will never be awakened during the night by your sheets coming off the corners of your bed.* DeBora Rachelle sheets regulate your body temperature and absorb perspiration.* DeBora Rachelle sheets do not contain any harmful chemicals, so your body can relax and not have to fight off any harmful chemicals as it sleeps.* DeBora Rachelle sheets are ultra-luxurious, soft, yet cool and crisp like a summer breeze, the ultimate to help you stay asleep!
Here is a link on how to make your bed: 

 
SPECIFICS:
Have you ever woken up at night with the sweats? Managing your body temperature is an important part of getting a good night's sleep. DeBora Rachelle luxury bed sheets are made of EXTRA LONG SINGLE-PLY STAPLE cotton which allows air flow circulation and moisture absorption. Our natural fibers draw moisture away from your skin to help prohibit you from waking up drenched in sweat during the night.   

DEBORA RACHELLE LUXURY BED SHEETS ARE SINGLE-PLY  
The ply of cotton fabric is much more important than the thread count. Thread count cannot exceed approximately 413 threads without the threads being manipulated in some way by twisting the life out of them with other threads. Once you start to twist threads together, it suffocates the airflow movement making the fabric less breathable, less durable and prone to pilling. Lack of airflow movement causes your body to retain heat so you will not receive the proper sleep you deserve. Think about how air flows through a braid in your hair verses a free flowing ponytail. DeBora Rachelle luxury bed sheets use one of the highest thread counts (400 thread count) available in single-ply.
Our fabric is OEKO-TEX TESTED and CERTIFIED which means, unlike 70% of bed sheet manufacturers, DeBora Rachelle luxury linens contain no harmful chemicals that can hurt you or your family.

There are many smart locks out there but they may not offer everything you need.<br/><br/>Imagine - as you approach your front door, it unlocks automatically and after you enter, it will lock itself. KeyWe can do this for you. </p><div>
<p>Sounds too easy?<br/><br/>Feeling unsure about the Smart Open? </p>
<p>The KeyWe has been tested in high rise buildings with many Bluetooth connections around and we are confident it is still fully functional in under these conditions.</p>
<p>The amazing part is that this is just one of many options of the KeyWe, you can try the Magic Touch - one which you can activate the touchpad with your smartphone and the door will open.</p>

<p>The KeyWe has the ability to store up to 20 passcodes per door lock, enabling each user to have their own unique code. </p>
</div><div>
<p>Expecting deliveries? </p>
<p>Why not try the One-Time Passcode (OTP) options for the courier? It's only valid for 2 minutes and can't be reused.</p>

<p><br/>However, some people prefer the traditional way and some prefer high tech but some of us are on the fence. </p>
<p>This is why the KeyWe offers functionality through your smartphone's NFC function, a physical key and even a key card (it's included - we've got you sorted)</p>

<p><br/>If you're an Airbnb host or have guests staying - there's also the Guest Key function which works just like a hotel key! (They don't even need to register to KeyWe!) </p>
</div><div>
<p>There won't be any confusion as the KeyWe will send you real time push notifications and will save records for up to two months.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the project our goal was to create a smart lock better than any on the market. This included the highest level of perfection for both hardware and software. Two years ago, a team of ten engineers developed KeyWe as a spin-off project within an established security company with over 30 years of industry experience. </p>
<p>Now KeyWe is being sold and serviced in 6 countries. We are confident that we have created the best smart lock on the market based on all our experiences and thoughts around the product. Production and research is located in Korea, customer service in San Francisco. By the time you get the product, we will be able to provide a 24/7 hotline service. The most important thing for us is the customer. We will do our best to achieve the highest customer satisfaction.</p>

There are many smart locks out there but they may not offer everything you need.Imagine - as you approach your front door, it unlocks automatically and after you enter, it will lock itself. KeyWe can do this for you. 
Sounds too easy?Feeling unsure about the Smart Open? 
The KeyWe has been tested in high rise buildings with many Bluetooth connections around and we are confident it is still fully functional in under these conditions.
The amazing part is that this is just one of many options of the KeyWe, you can try the Magic Touch - one which you can activate the touchpad with your smartphone and the door will open.

The KeyWe has the ability to store up to 20 passcodes per door lock, enabling each user to have their own unique code. 

Expecting deliveries? 
Why not try the One-Time Passcode (OTP) options for the courier? It's only valid for 2 minutes and can't be reused.

However, some people prefer the traditional way and some prefer high tech but some of us are on the fence. 
This is why the KeyWe offers functionality through your smartphone's NFC function, a physical key and even a key card (it's included - we've got you sorted)

If you're an Airbnb host or have guests staying - there's also the Guest Key function which works just like a hotel key! (They don't even need to register to KeyWe!) 

There won't be any confusion as the KeyWe will send you real time push notifications and will save records for up to two months.

The UI (User Interface) is easy to understand and use yet powerful 

just to list a few: 
-All features of the door lock can be set and controlled through the app -The app will send an alarm when the battery is low-Allow you to invite new users or guests-Register multiple locks to one app -Change the lock's hardware setting with the app



We want to offer more connections where possible. 

Z-Wave integrated KeyWe is designed to sync with hubs already in the market e.g. Alexa, so we can help build your smart home without the hassle.  
This is still a work in progress and we aim to enable any connections to any smart hub out there, also providing WiFi Bridge App and hardware. 
 












From the beginning of the project our goal was to create a smart lock better than any on the market. This included the highest level of perfection for both hardware and software. Two years ago, a team of ten engineers developed KeyWe as a spin-off project within an established security company with over 30 years of industry experience. 
Now KeyWe is being sold and serviced in 6 countries. We are confident that we have created the best smart lock on the market based on all our experiences and thoughts around the product. Production and research is located in Korea, customer service in San Francisco. By the time you get the product, we will be able to provide a 24/7 hotline service. The most important thing for us is the customer. We will do our best to achieve the highest customer satisfaction.

Treat yourself with better sleep and purchase your Kello today on our website.

 
       
 Great days start with good habitsStress and fatigue are the most common causes of lost sleep, affecting as much as 72% of the population. Sleep is a one way ticket to good health. So why do we all sleep badly?Kello has the answer: when it comes to sleep, it’s all about lifestyle.   How can Kello improve your sleep?Choose a program and let Kello take care of the rest. By using simple, effective and scientifically proven techniques, Kello helps you renew your sleep pattern and kick-start your morning routine.Fixing your sleep night after night means a healthier life day after day.  What's the secret sauce behind Kello's Sleep Programs?We've worked hand-in-hand with sleep specialists and analyzed hundreds of studies on sleep behavior so you can learn better bedtime habits to improve your daily productivity and energy.Here are some of the Sleep Programs that you'll find at launch, with more to be added all the time.    “Waking up, hitting the snooze button and drifting back to sleep is called fragmented sleep. Fragmented sleep has been proven to be not restorative.” (Journal of Sleep - The Effect of Sleep Fragmentation on Daytime Function)Kello can limit how many times a week you’re allowed to snooze. By ringing louder, changing playlists and even switching on the lights when you have used up your snooze allowance, you will improve your morning routine in no time.    ""You won’t be able to change your sleep schedule overnight. The most effective tactic is to make small changes slowly."" (The National Sleep Foundation, 'How To Get On A Sleep Schedule').Being in a rush is never a good way to start the day. We’ve all tried to set the alarm 45 minutes earlier only to snooze our way through it when the time comes.Why is it so hard? Because we're creatures of habit and our bodies dislike change.Slow and steady wins the race: Kello helps you get to your personal wake-up goal by knocking off a few minutes from your alarm every day.         ""Getting the best sleep ever is as simple as breathing. It helps people quiet the mind and let go of preoccupying thoughts."" (Medical Daily, May 2015).We all know the feeling: wide awake, under a stuffy blanket, head buzzing with thoughts when we should be long gone into slumber land. That’s where the ‘Fall Asleep Fast’ feature comes in.It gets you to focus on matching your breathing to a light pattern, slowing your mind and body as one.Once your breaths reach the perfect-for-sleep 6 breaths per minute, the relaxing music or specially developed white noises fade away, sending you to sleep 2.5 times faster than before.        `""Keeping a regular sleep schedule maintains the timing of the body's internal clock and can help you fall asleep and wake up more easily."" (Harvard Medical School, Division Of Sleep Medicine, December 2008).Restorative sleep is achieved through regular bedtimes. Kello notifies you when it’s time to get ready for bed for a healthier sleeping routine.Kello displays a sky full of stars when it’s bedtime: all you have to do is tap Kello’s head to check in to sleep and log your bedtime.    The Sleep PlatformThe ‘Sleep Platform’ is where all of our Sleep Programs live. You can access it and download Sleep Programs through Kello’s companion app.Here are a few additional Sleep Programs you will find at launch:Fight Jet LagTackle oncoming jet lag before a trip. Enter your trip details and Kello will personalize your sleep schedule to adjust your body clock.  Power NapsBoost your day with short power naps: Kello plays the right music for the right amount of sleep to get you through the rest of your day.   And More!We will constantly update Kello and add new programs to Kello’s Sleep Platform.      Starting a Sleep Program (Get To Sleep Fast)Kello is also a connected audio device. Thanks to its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, listen to all your favorite music anytime, any day. Tune Into A Good DayA great song can put you in a great mood. Kello helps kick-start your mornings with great tracks, day after day.Spring into action or hit the sack with your favorite playlists on Spotify, Deezer, SoundCloud, Tidal and more. Or tune into one of the podcasts from the 100.000+ radios available on vTuner.  Kello also comes with a collection of nature sounds.     Ban Your Phone From The BedroomWhen it comes to getting some good shuteye, our smartphones keep our brains roused and vigilant with endless distractions.This is why Kello doesn’t need your phone. This is one baby you can put in the corner while you get a decent night’s sleep.  A Smart Alarm Clock Belongs In A Smart HomeKello doesn’t just make you sleep better, it helps make life easier. Double tapping its head can trigger actions around the house.It can even trigger an action when the alarm goes off, because who doesn’t like to wake up to the smell of coffee in the morning?Kello can:     Not Your Average Alarm ClockAn alarm clock is a personal device. It sits next to you day in, day out. That’s why we’ve listened to people’s feedback to create the best alarm clock ever.   Kello's Companion AppIn order to set your alarms, start Sleep Programs, and manage Kello's settings, Kello comes with a companion app that connects to Kello via Wi-Fi.The Kello app will be available both on the App Store for iOS users and on Google Play for Android users. Setting up a Spotify alarm with Kello's companion app    A Great Speaker For A Great MorningKello has a high quality integrated speaker to make sure the first thing you hear on a morning sounds crisp and clear.Thanks to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, Kello is the external speaker of all your connected devices.      Get Dazzled By Its Looks, Not The ScreenKello progressively dims the screen so you can sleep like a baby. Or you can go out like a light simply by switching Kello’s screen off.   Never Go Hunting For Your Cables AgainSay goodbye to endless nights of looking for your charging cable under the bed. Kello integrates a fast charging USB port for all your devices.  We spent months looking for the perfect Kello. Sixty iterations later we came up with this smooth little guy.
   MaterialsKello’s shell is protected by a high quality silicone coating that prevents it from getting dusty or stained over time and gives it a soft touch feel.The front surface is covered with an acoustic fabric to protect the speaker.   ColorsColor is important, so we reached out to our community to find out which shades would best suit Kello.

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Also, it´s easy to clean, since you can easily detach the shade (which is the part of the lamps that collect the most dust), you can dust off or vacuum clean with not much effort.</span></p>

<p></p></div>","The Vortice
Hello IndieGoGo supporters, welcome to my page, I present to you the Vortice, a small bedside, floor, desk or ceiling lamp that incorporates 3 powerfull magnets that hold the shade in place, no need to unscrew your shade, just pull and voilá, easy to access the lightbulb, now just change it and place the shade back on.
Also, it´s easy to clean, since you can easily detach the shade (which is the part of the lamps that collect the most dust), you can dust off or vacuum clean with not much effort.




The Vortice lamp will look good in your entrance, bedroom, floor... Any where you like. It also has two ceiling versions, one individual for small places and one with three shades for bigger rooms (you can see images of these two version below, on the ""Perks explained"" section).




We´ve chosen the materials that are easier to recycle and match our needs, so we used polypropylene and acrylic.
The size of the Vortice is around 28 centimeters tall and width (11 inches). 



Colorful and customizable!
The Vortice loves light and colour! You can choose the colour of the backpiece and textile cord, make it your own to match your enviroment. Besides the colour you can also choose to have a brushed or chromed dome, whatever matches your style the best.
You can also choose the electric plug for your country.









How this idea was born? 
It was a year ago that it all began, I was fooling around with making curved origami inspired by the work of the brilliant David Huffman, after finding a shape that I found pleasing for the shade, I began to think how I would hold the light bulb in place.This actually created a problem: how can I change the light bulb easily in a closed shade...? And then it came to me, magnets! Easy to remove the shade, easy to put back on, no need of screws, metal parts or springs to hold it in place.So after many prototypes to polish the shape and many other prototypes to get a pleasing and colorful back piece, I was ready for this campaign.Where will the money go?Part of the money will be to invest in better molds for the back acrylic piece, plus make good contrats with our providers, which I already have decided where to build the production pieces, but they only believe when they see the investment.The Vortice is completly built in Portugal, since I want to use the best of my country so I can work closely with the companies that will make some of the pieces, also make sure I can fix mistakes quickly when they happen. Also part of it will be to build the site and distribution. (notice that we can only build the site if we reach our goal, if so, to honor the people that contribute, their names will appear on the facebook page if the site is not built).The perks explained:On this section you can see images of the perks and a chart to better understand what you get in each one.Note: the color changing light bulb seen above I do not advise to be used as a reading light or to light up a room like a regular light bulb, its perfect to make a colorful spot light in your room, creating a mood.Who am I?I´m a industrial Designer from Portugal with a bunch of ideas bubbling in my head, had already the chance to see some of my designs win international awards that took me for some really amazing experiences. When I had this idea I thougth it would be perfect for this site and so I develop some prototypes (which you can see some on the video and images) and now I would like to go for the next step, making some production runs, better molds, final pieces using good industrial machines to speed up the process.Thank you for the support!If you reached this part, it´s because you read the whole thing!

You rarely see me, but you can feel me when I’m upset.  Please start using water, it’ll make me happy and when I’m happy, you’re happy.” 
 
 How does Narsehole connect? It attaches in-between the seat and bowl and connects to the fresh water supply coming out of the wall via an included hose splitter.  Perfect for any occasion: You can activate the individual nozzles for the starfish or the clam, or both nozzle sprays at the same time for the dreaded diarrhea days. This will take care of your whole butt and restart you back in the game of life as if nothing was ever wrong in the first place. Side note - thought about what you wanna get your grandparents for Christmas this year? (wink)What’s the “Clam” for? If you happen to find yourself in ownership of a vagina on your frontside…set the directional knob to the “Clam”, turn the water on low:) Water is an effective way to remove bacteria and prevent UTIs. What is the temperature of the water? It’s cool/room temperature water. It’s kinda like splashing your face with water in the morning...a nice little wake me up :) 
 
 How do I poop with the Narsehole? Poop, play on your phone for a while to make sure it’s all out, turn the direction knob to the “starfish” and the water pressure knob to desired spray, turn water off, pat dry with a few squares of toilet paper or hand towel, and you’re done. 
 
 What types of toilets can Narsehole attach to? Almost any toilet. If you can see your water supply then install’s super easy! Everything is included in the box to connect.Does the Narsehole require electricity? Nope. It’s powered entirely by your fresh water supply. That means if your power goes out you can still clean your butt! NEW - Two Handle Options!

      Toilet paper is a 38 billion and 10 million tree a year industry in the U.S. Save money, the environment and your butt. 
 Day of the Nareshole ShootWe’re four dudes that used water to clean our butts for the first time in our mid 30’s. It was amazing, faster, more efficient and it left us feeling clean and fresh! We were shocked. Our goal -  Is to red pill everyone on water over toilet paper and to make sure their first experience is with a spray that’s gentle but firm, if they need it to be.

The electronic circuit of Locky is there to detect the turning of the key in a lock. As soon as you push the key out of the overlay, the wake-up switch turns the electronics on. Now, the IMU sensor detects and defines the movement of the key. The information obtained this way is sent to the app through a micro-controller via the built-in Bluetooth. The circuit also contains a speaker, which signals events and generates the key finder sound, and a replaceable battery. The electronics of Locky were designed with dependability and accuracy in mind, and we also wanted the device to be light and small.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537965417/jtzriiotcrhcpswwlqkb.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537965472/mnwm7u8nqfy85wbws6zk.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537965507/zjtv6wkwst6yntrrye7s.png"" src=""""/></p><p>We've been working on Locky for a year now.

Never again will you forget to close your door, nor will you lose your keys, thanks to the key finder function.Locky has most of the features of smart locks, but instead of focusing on the lock, we focused on how you use your key.Be sure that your home is safeLocky key overlay tracks the usage of your door lock and provides personalized information to the mobile app, which means you can check your door status, anytime and anywhere. Forget about forgetting to close the door It happens to the best of us, but with Locky you won't even start wondering if you locked your door. An instant unlocked door notification will let you correct your mistake before you manage to walk away from your house. Locate your keys anytime you need them According to statistics, keys are the third most commonly lost item, and first most difficult to find. With Locky, finding them takes only a matter of seconds, because the overlay is always on your key, working as a key tracker. Never leave your keys in the lock againIt's common to leave keys hanging in the front door, especially when you're tired, in a rush, or your hands are full of groceries. But that's dangerous! Thankfully, an immediate alert from Locky will never allow that to happen again. Full history of door lock status on your phone Do you like to have things under control? You can always check the exact time and day you locked or unlocked any door in your house, even if it was done by someone else, provided their key also has the overlay. Full door usage history is always available! Get notified if and when your child gets home If you equip your loved ones with Locky, you can track their door-related activities in the app. You can check when they left the house, or if the kids came home safely, or if your partner didn't forget to lock the door when in a rush. Locky allows you to protect your family's security, even from far away.  Upgrade your Master Key System with smart home features  A Master Key System allows you to open many doors with the same key. Thanks to the beacon stickers expansion Locky works great with this convenient solution. An Estimote beacon technology allows Locky to recognize every door without fail and track its status. Smarten your key in a few seconds There's no need to change your keys or habits, just get the smart and practical overlay and upgrade the key into a home security system. Locky allows you to keep the feeling of security which is provided by keeping an actual, physical key always with you. Carry your keys in styleLocky is not only extremely helpful and full of features, but also looks great!

Door usage history 
Review the full history of locking and unlocking your door with detailed information on your phone, anytime, anywhere.

 Smartwatches notificationsLocky is compatible with three most popular smartwatches: Apple Watch, Fitbit and Wear OS (Android) devices, which means that you can receive all notifications directly on your smart watch.Locky is based on the innovative idea of monitoring the movements of your key instead of tracking the lock usage to get the very same data. The electronic circuit of Locky is there to detect the turning of the key in a lock. As soon as you push the key out of the overlay, the wake-up switch turns the electronics on. Now, the IMU sensor detects and defines the movement of the key. The information obtained this way is sent to the app through a micro-controller via the built-in Bluetooth. The circuit also contains a speaker, which signals events and generates the key finder sound, and a replaceable battery. The electronics of Locky were designed with dependability and accuracy in mind, and we also wanted the device to be light and small. We've been working on Locky for a year now. From the beginning, our goal was to build a device that was simple and easy to use, but also multi-functional.  The result of the intense, yearly work of the whole team is a product we are very proud of.

<p>We need <strong>$100,000</strong> to build community gardens, school gardens and child care center gardens and to develop the Natural Teaching Curriculum.  The funding will go toward the materials, transportation of materials, and administration of the requests for funding for each garden.  The funding will also go toward hiring the appropriate people to write the curriculum and to publish the curriculum as it is completed.</p>
<p>At this time, we are asking for funding to begin our outreach to communities and organizations to start gardens at schools, community gardens, childcare centers, etc.  We need your help to support many to be able to feed themselves and learn how to take good care of the Earth so the Earth will take good care of them.  Thank you for your generosity and support for such a worthy cause.</p>
<p>if we don't reach our goal, we will place the funds that we do receive into an account and continue to write grants, and do fundraising until we do have our goal.</p>

<p>We have taken groups of teachers to the <strong>Water Shed Project for “Kids In Gardens”</strong> workshops so that the teachers will gain information and hands-on experience to develop their “garden curriculum” with their new gardens.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Gardens In Friendship Together, builds community gardens and school gardens, as well as individual/family gardens throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. These projects are to support learning about the Earth, feeding those who are in need of fresh food, and to help everyone become more environmentally wise.
Natural Teaching Curriculum will educate all ages about how to grow a garden and understand the effects we have on the Earth and all living beings that are an integral part of the Earth.  This curriculum is expected to be a part of the contract when supporting Requests for Proposals (RFP) from the community garens, schools, child care centers as well as families and individuals. Teachers, adults and children will be taught all about what to expect and how to use science, math, language, and social skills, while building and growing their gardens. This education will guide the future of the gardens and the people involved for generations.

<h3>What Happend... </h3>
<p>I heard the phone ring at 11:17 at night and thought who's calling me this late? When I saw the phone I saw it was my mom and answered... </p>
<p>She started talking quickly and mentioned a fire and everything burning up... I couldn't quite make out what she said so I said 'wait what happend?' she said it a second time.</p>
<p>Your brothers apartment is on fire and everything just burned up in it... He doesn't have nothing, no money, cards, ID, car keys, nothing.</p>
<p>My mom was visiting this side of the state to see clients, she's a holistic health specialist and was seeing clients.  She lost some of her equipment as well as all the money that she had worked for over the past several days (a few thousand dollars of equipment and money she lost) </p>
<p>My brother and his roommate Jr lost everything.</p>
<p>Their clothes, computers, ID, money, furniture, TV and pictures that they will never get back.</p>
<p>For me being close to each of them this was hard to hear because my mom is a cancer survivor and now her work helps others to live healthier lives to hopefully prevent getting cancer, so for her to lose part of her equipment and the money she worked for was tough... </p>
<p>To hear that my brother lost everything is tough, I have no idea what I would do if I were in that situation... having to work as well as live but having to start over again from scratch.</p>
<p>And his roommate Jr... a great guy who helps me out with graphic design when I need it was actually helping me out today with a new book cover... the day of the fire.</p>
<p>So, being that my brother and mom lost a lot and that a good friend lost a lot too I wanted to create this campaign to raise money to help them get some basic needs met like clothes, food, and the basics.</p>
<p>I realize that they will eventually get insurance but with the paperwork and wait I am not sure what they will do in the meantime so I figure this is the least I could do.</p>
<p>Give 5 or 10 bucks and it will go a long way.  It would really mean a lot to me and to them.</p>
<p>This year has been an especially tough year for my mom in her life personally so hearing this was tough because I know for her doing this work within the health space is one thing that she loves and this just cuts off her ability to work until she can get the equipment she lost again. </p>
<p>I hope that you will find a place in your heart to give, it will come back to you 10-fold... it's the way the universe works. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What They Need</h3>
<p>* I am looking to raise $10,000.  I want to be able to give my brother and his roommate (my friend Jr) 4k each to get back on their feet and be able to give my mom 2k to get the equipment she lost so she can still see clients and not have to wait it out... She lost her ID and everything in the fire so it could literally be a month till she get's her id and credit cards again and then time to order the new equipment after that.</p>
<p><strong>Please Donate, would really mean a lot...</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you cannot donate please share it on facebook, twitter, linkedin, google plus, pinterest, your blog etc... anywhere. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks for your time and consideration,</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>David King </strong></p>
<p><strong>I was just texting my brother and he was telling me how he noticed the fire and started knocking on doors and got his neighbors out of the building... Could have saved someone's life too.</strong></p>
<p><strong>P.S. This fire happend because someone who was TOLD not to use their fireplace because it needed to be cleaned used it and then the fire started... Ladies and gentlemen, follow basic instructions if someone who is smarter than you about something gives them to you... a bunch of people (2 of my family members) could have burned to death today because of one individuals choice to ignore something very basic.... Be smart, stay safe and make decisions that don't put others in harms way.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>UPDATE: </strong></h2>
<p><strong>I (being new to indiegogo) made this campaign only run 24 hours on accident.  I'm sure they could use more help so if you would like to help personally please don't hesitate to facebook me below personally and I will put you in touch with them.  Thank you so much for all of your support, it's been a blessing and they are very grateful. </strong></p>

An elegant tool to transform the way you read.By removing the need to push books open with your thumb, Page Anchor elevates the experience of using everything from hardcover and paperback books to journals and cookbooks.Page Anchor works with any book size, without damaging your book's spine. As technology advances, we spend more and more time feeling stressed from contant push notifications, short-form information and emails. This is why we believe it to be more important than ever to incorporate reading into our daily routines.Page Anchor is our way of incentivizing the world to read more. Our mission is to make reading more relaxed and enjoyable through elegant and functional design. Page Anchor has helped over 804+ book enthusiasts, modern professionals, students, and cookbook-users transform their reading experiences. We spent almost two years designing Page Anchor from the bottom up, obsessed with continuously iterating to make sure that the products could uphold our strict standards.The final version features a seamless body crafted in the finest 316L stainless steel. Each Page Anchor weighs in at a mere 23 grams to avoid being a burden to carry arround.We finish every anchor with a layer of precious metals and a rigorous hand-polish, resulting in its timeless and elegant appearance.  We launched our first versions of Page Anchor last year and have over 804 users. See what they have to say! Being able to finally release our full collection after two years of iterations feels nothing less than amazing.Here's a quick summary of what has happened since our earliest days of development:September 2016We created the first 3D mockup of Page Anchor, giving a real sense of what we were aiming to create.May 2017We ship the first version of the Signature Gold Page Anchor to our earliest customers.June 2017Our second model, the Winter Platinum Page Anchor, is introduced to the world. This silvery-white Page Anchor was inspired by Sweden's cold North.April 2018We recently finished the final prototypes of our two brand new models—the Rose Gold and Obsidian Black. They will be available alongside the new and improved versions of the Signature Gold and Winter Platinum models. 10 of our early supporters have already received a finished prototype of the new models. Here's what they have said about them: Page Anchor has shipped more than 1000 products to over 30 countries around the world, and this is just the beginning.You can reach our team at help@page-anchor.com - we read and reply to all your emails.Special thanksWe would love to thank our friends and family, and of course all customers of our previous versions of Page Anchor for believing in us.

This stores the network information and does troubleshooting to figure out why the WiFi stopped working. It will tell you if it was the router, the modem, the WiFi radio, or the Internet service provider. It can also send email alerts if things are offline and when they are fixed. And you can send a remote reset to the device from anywhere.</p><p>We are now getting ready to make our 2nd generation ResetPlug. It has a new chipset that includes 5GHz, better antenna design for better diagnostics, and it will be available in plug types for almost all of the world.</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We are raising money with preorders to make sure we can meet the minimum order requirements of our manufacturing facility.

<p>Plants convert certain wavelengths of light into energy using photosynthesis. With the wrong light, plants will elongate or die. Too much blue light and your plants will never grow, too much red and they will never develop strong roots.

<p>Pictured from left to right is Chris, Mike, and Paul; we are Soltech Solutions. Our team is compiled of Penn State University and Temple University graduates with backgrounds in Environmental Science, Energy Engineering, and Political Science.    </p>
<p>We initially created Soltech Solutions 2 years ago to design and manufacture traditional, high powered, red and blue growlights. After some extensive research in groundbreaking LED technology and plant growth we realized there were no growlights that could efficiently grow your plants while simultaneously creating a welcoming indoor atmosphere. We set out to bring a solution to this problem and developed the first décor pendant style growlight.</p>
<p>In the early stages of development we ran through heaps of prototypes finally landing on a design that could work. The first model of the Aspect hit the market January of 2016 and we’ve had nothing but positive feedback.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478807188/frzrpim5z3bn0gltpgkx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Because of our manufacturing space (the basement of a local business incubator) and the long manufacturing process, we knew we had to come up with a better design. We took all of your feedback into consideration and developed the new Aspect model. It’s sleeker, more efficient, and includes custom options never before offered. With a colorful choice of cords and the addition of lampshades, your home décor will never look the same.</p>
<p>Our mission is for everyone to be able to use our product, weather you have a green thumb or are a Grass-assassin! We want to make it easy for people to bring nature indoors and with the Aspect, you can.</p>

Plants convert certain wavelengths of light into energy using photosynthesis. With the wrong light, plants will elongate or die. Too much blue light and your plants will never grow, too much red and they will never develop strong roots. By using LED technology, we are able to produce the exact wavelengths in the right balance of blue and red that supports beautiful, healthy plants.
We offer two spectrums for both residential and commercial growers.

Pictured from left to right is Chris, Mike, and Paul; we are Soltech Solutions. Our team is compiled of Penn State University and Temple University graduates with backgrounds in Environmental Science, Energy Engineering, and Political Science.    
We initially created Soltech Solutions 2 years ago to design and manufacture traditional, high powered, red and blue growlights. After some extensive research in groundbreaking LED technology and plant growth we realized there were no growlights that could efficiently grow your plants while simultaneously creating a welcoming indoor atmosphere. We set out to bring a solution to this problem and developed the first décor pendant style growlight.
In the early stages of development we ran through heaps of prototypes finally landing on a design that could work. The first model of the Aspect hit the market January of 2016 and we’ve had nothing but positive feedback.

Because of our manufacturing space (the basement of a local business incubator) and the long manufacturing process, we knew we had to come up with a better design. We took all of your feedback into consideration and developed the new Aspect model. It’s sleeker, more efficient, and includes custom options never before offered. With a colorful choice of cords and the addition of lampshades, your home décor will never look the same.
Our mission is for everyone to be able to use our product, weather you have a green thumb or are a Grass-assassin! We want to make it easy for people to bring nature indoors and with the Aspect, you can.

A few years ago, Darren was excited to bring home a SodaStream for his family. He was looking forward to getting creative, coming up with new recipes and cutting back on sugar. But he discovered that the device could only carbonate water, required a CO2 tank that needed to be kept in his family’s kitchen and used synthesized chemicals for flavor.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Darren and Roy decided to make something better. Something that didn’t limit people to pre-packaged flavors or rely on a bulky tank. They spent the next two years in research and development, learning about the carbonation process, and developing prototypes of their tank-free system. This resulted in Spärkel, which launched in May 2019.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h1 style=""text-align: center;color:#056880;font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;Font-weight: 300;"">On Your Countertop Soon</h1><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556583183/blsv2mwvbuegghxy4jjt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556583193/i4q31tnss6ce4svpwqau.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h1 style=""text-align: center;color:#056880;font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;Font-weight: 300;"">All About Spärkel Shipping</h1><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556583242/m6l5ansk60r3529gd04o.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">We are able to ship to the United States and Canada.

A few years ago, Darren was excited to bring home a SodaStream for his family. He was looking forward to getting creative, coming up with new recipes and cutting back on sugar. But he discovered that the device could only carbonate water, required a CO2 tank that needed to be kept in his family’s kitchen and used synthesized chemicals for flavor.Darren and Roy decided to make something better. Something that didn’t limit people to pre-packaged flavors or rely on a bulky tank. They spent the next two years in research and development, learning about the carbonation process, and developing prototypes of their tank-free system. This resulted in Spärkel, which launched in May 2019. On Your Countertop Soon All About Spärkel ShippingWe are able to ship to the United States and Canada.

<p>Cast iron is one of the best materials ever used for cookware. Its legendary cooking properties, durability, and versatility make cast iron a staple in every kitchen. When Teflon took over the cookware universe in the 1960’s nearly all of the famous manufacturers stopped creating their legendary cookware and closed their factories. Non-stick coatings breakdown fairly quickly and become useless after the coatings flake off whereas cast iron cookware is routinely used for generations. </p>

<p>With the rise of the new foodie culture, there has been a renewed interest better cooking tools and better cast iron.</p>
<p>We decided to develop our skillets because none of the current manufacturers have created a product that can replicate the quality of the vintage pans. Our goal was to bring back the vintage quality and add some aspects that would make our pans easier to use. The weight of cast iron is one of the biggest drawbacks to the material. This is why reducing the weight of the cookware was one of our main design goals. Lighter cookware is easier to handle and clean. In order to make cast iron cookware more convenient, we knew it needed to be sold completely seasoned and ready to use, not just lightly coated to prevent rusting like some manufacturers. This is what drove us to create an industry leading seasoning process, so each pan is ready to use right out of the box. We also designed our cooking surface to hold the seasoning better than any other skillet, so that it requires re-seasoning less often.</p>

<p>Modern foundries are not equipped to achieve the desired wall thickness or surface finish with typical sand casting. Casting in sand and then milling is one way to reduce weight, but it introduces an imperfect secondary process and can’t correct every surface of the pan.</p>
<p>We discovered that by using a process called Investment casting (lost wax) that the wall sections could be thinner and the finished product would be much smoother on ALL surfaces – just like the vintage pans. We use investment casting for our 8"" and 10"" skillets, but due to its size the 12"" is cast in sand molds then milled.</p>
<p>We are completing the tooling for all of our skillets and will be able to start production <b>immediately</b> after the campaign is over. We are currently going through test runs of our seasoning process at our factory so that all the details will be worked out once we start production.</p>

<p>Keeping the pans from rusting after manufacturing is a problem that any cast iron manufacturer needs to address. One coat of vegetable oil will solve that problem, but makes for a very bad “seasoning”. Also, if not done properly, the “pre-seasoning” oil can lift during use, making for a very poor base for future seasoning. We decided to turn this technical problem into a feature by finishing each pan with 4 coats of baked on flax seed oil.</p>
<div data-id=""14046104""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1479241839/gfmvhxgne16mr1ll71ri.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Our testing and research shows that flax has among the best properties of any seasoning oil option. Since the inside of our skillets are extremely smooth, we found it necessary to use <a href=""http://www.genuineideas.com/ArticlesIndex/castironseasoning.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Greg Blonder’s</a> etching recipe to better prepare the surface so that the seasoning oil can stick. After the skillets are cast they are soaked in a recipe of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid for a short period of time. This etching microscopically erodes the surface grain of the iron, creating a “micro pitting” that provides a much better surface for the oil to adhere. This process results in a pan that is ready to use right out of the box with no further seasoning necessary, it also creates a seasoned base that is more durable and less likely to break down over time. The skillets are then finished with 4 coats of baked on flax seed oil. The skillets spend about 3 hours in the oven per coat to fully cure the oil. The flax seed oil creates a hard and durable base to build further seasoning upon as your pan ages.</p>

<p>One of the biggest drawbacks of using vintage cast iron pans is the short stubby handle. It is always too hot, sits very close to the cooking surface and has a look that should have been left in the 1800’s. Our ideal design kept similar dimensions, wall thicknesses and surface finishes on the pan part, but updated the look, feel and function of the handle.</p>
<div data-id=""14071216""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1479241842/ttxvshagbf1nbufs8bad.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>

<p>We considered using alternate materials and metals for the handle in hopes of creating a pan that could be largely used without the aid of a handle cover or oven mitt. All of the options were compromises that took away from the timeless durability of a cast iron pan. We needed our pans to conform to the convention that cast iron pans are nearly indestructible. No matter the heat source, recipe or food – cast iron skillets need to perform. Over the lifetime of a pan, the seasoning will most likely be compromised. Stripping and re-seasoning often subjects the pan to conditions and chemicals that would damage lesser metals or other materials. A multi-material pan also creates a weak point between the pan and the handle which could break at some point in the future. These factors drove our decision to stick with a single solid casting. We did our best to mitigate the heat transfer by creating a crescent shaped gap between the pan and the handle, slowing down the heat transfer.</p>
<p>With skillets, there is no such thing as one size fits all. We knew we wanted to launch with 3 sizes. We started with the 12” as the largest commonly used size. Once we finalized all the elements we scaled down the design to make 8” and 10” versions. These pans were small and light enough to remove the helper handle. We found that “weight” and “heft” were some of the biggest complaints of cast iron users. Our designs are focused on reducing the weight and improving the feel making the skillets easier to use.</p>

Its legendary cooking properties, durability, and versatility make cast iron a staple in every kitchen. When Teflon took over the cookware universe in the 1960’s nearly all of the famous manufacturers stopped creating their legendary cookware and closed their factories. Non-stick coatings breakdown fairly quickly and become useless after the coatings flake off whereas cast iron cookware is routinely used for generations. 

 
With the rise of the new foodie culture, there has been a renewed interest better cooking tools and better cast iron.
We decided to develop our skillets because none of the current manufacturers have created a product that can replicate the quality of the vintage pans. Our goal was to bring back the vintage quality and add some aspects that would make our pans easier to use. The weight of cast iron is one of the biggest drawbacks to the material. This is why reducing the weight of the cookware was one of our main design goals. Lighter cookware is easier to handle and clean. In order to make cast iron cookware more convenient, we knew it needed to be sold completely seasoned and ready to use, not just lightly coated to prevent rusting like some manufacturers. This is what drove us to create an industry leading seasoning process, so each pan is ready to use right out of the box. We also designed our cooking surface to hold the seasoning better than any other skillet, so that it requires re-seasoning less often.

Modern foundries are not equipped to achieve the desired wall thickness or surface finish with typical sand casting. Casting in sand and then milling is one way to reduce weight, but it introduces an imperfect secondary process and can’t correct every surface of the pan.
We discovered that by using a process called Investment casting (lost wax) that the wall sections could be thinner and the finished product would be much smoother on ALL surfaces – just like the vintage pans. We use investment casting for our 8"" and 10"" skillets, but due to its size the 12"" is cast in sand molds then milled.
We are completing the tooling for all of our skillets and will be able to start production immediately after the campaign is over. We are currently going through test runs of our seasoning process at our factory so that all the details will be worked out once we start production.

Keeping the pans from rusting after manufacturing is a problem that any cast iron manufacturer needs to address. One coat of vegetable oil will solve that problem, but makes for a very bad “seasoning”. Also, if not done properly, the “pre-seasoning” oil can lift during use, making for a very poor base for future seasoning. We decided to turn this technical problem into a feature by finishing each pan with 4 coats of baked on flax seed oil.

Our testing and research shows that flax has among the best properties of any seasoning oil option. Since the inside of our skillets are extremely smooth, we found it necessary to use Greg Blonder’s etching recipe to better prepare the surface so that the seasoning oil can stick. After the skillets are cast they are soaked in a recipe of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid for a short period of time. This etching microscopically erodes the surface grain of the iron, creating a “micro pitting” that provides a much better surface for the oil to adhere. This process results in a pan that is ready to use right out of the box with no further seasoning necessary, it also creates a seasoned base that is more durable and less likely to break down over time. The skillets are then finished with 4 coats of baked on flax seed oil. The skillets spend about 3 hours in the oven per coat to fully cure the oil. The flax seed oil creates a hard and durable base to build further seasoning upon as your pan ages.

One of the biggest drawbacks of using vintage cast iron pans is the short stubby handle. It is always too hot, sits very close to the cooking surface and has a look that should have been left in the 1800’s. Our ideal design kept similar dimensions, wall thicknesses and surface finishes on the pan part, but updated the look, feel and function of the handle.

 

We considered using alternate materials and metals for the handle in hopes of creating a pan that could be largely used without the aid of a handle cover or oven mitt. All of the options were compromises that took away from the timeless durability of a cast iron pan. We needed our pans to conform to the convention that cast iron pans are nearly indestructible. No matter the heat source, recipe or food – cast iron skillets need to perform. Over the lifetime of a pan, the seasoning will most likely be compromised. Stripping and re-seasoning often subjects the pan to conditions and chemicals that would damage lesser metals or other materials. A multi-material pan also creates a weak point between the pan and the handle which could break at some point in the future. These factors drove our decision to stick with a single solid casting. We did our best to mitigate the heat transfer by creating a crescent shaped gap between the pan and the handle, slowing down the heat transfer.
With skillets, there is no such thing as one size fits all. We knew we wanted to launch with 3 sizes. We started with the 12” as the largest commonly used size. Once we finalized all the elements we scaled down the design to make 8” and 10” versions. These pans were small and light enough to remove the helper handle. We found that “weight” and “heft” were some of the biggest complaints of cast iron users. Our designs are focused on reducing the weight and improving the feel making the skillets easier to use.

   Working with an overseas manufacturer creates many opportunities for time delays. The partners at Marquette Castings have experience working with foreign manufacturers and importing consumer products. Once products are in transit to our warehouse there are still numerous transportation issues that can arise, and while they are rare, such issues could have significant consequences on our ability to deliver the project on time. The good news is that we already have a finalized product, tooling and supply chain to quickly put into action upon the completion of a successful campaign.  How do I know the metal is safe? 
We test multiple samples from each production run to ensure the metal alloy meets our exact specifications and is FDA compliant. These reports will be available on our website.
How does the Lifetime Warranty work?  
It’s a piece of iron – not much can go wrong. If it does, we are here to help. We will also provide ample support and information on how to get your pan back to new condition if the seasoning is compromised.
What order will my skillet ship?  The skillets will ship prioritized on what production cycle you have chosen, and then by when your order came in. Some sizes may be available sooner than others – if you ordered multiple sizes, we will do our best to ship them to you as soon as we have them. Multiple skillet orders are given shipping priority to single orders.

It is made by stainless steel, has a larger diameter at one end, can just go through the holes in the bottom of the ice mold, and push out the ice cubes. The other end is smaller, can be used to fork fruit or olive, to decorate your drink. There are four different laser-carving geometric patterns on the stick.Once we reach $120,000, we will offer every set of Polar Ice Ball 2.0 with one swizzle stick. If you are the backer of the Group Buying Set, you will get four different pattern sticks at the same time. Better ice, better drinksOur family once discussed why beverages at restaurants tasted so good. My wife said ""it is only a psychological effect,” but my daughter and I disagreed. We started to do a more serious comparison and came to the conclusion that ice at restaurants is simply not the same...Ice cubes in restaurants are made in specialized ice-making machines and are more transparent. What's so special about crystal clear ice?It enhances the taste of your drink.The ice that comes out of your freezer contains air bubbles and other impurities, which can ruin the taste of your drink. Crystal clear ice, on the other hand, is flavorless and odorless.It looks fascinating. Shining with clarity, or glimmering under dim light, crystal clear ice in your craft drinks will transform your beverages into exquisite works of art. Moreover, adding a flower or piece of fruit between the silicone layers can turn your clear ice into an amazing show piece! It's perfect for a romantic occasion and it's a great way to impress you friends!Best for your whiskeyWhiskey and Scotch lovers can enjoy the taste and aromas of their favorite spirit on the rocks.By lowering the serving temperature of your whiskey or mixed drink, clear ice enhances your beverage by adding a cold, crisp taste. What people said about original Polar Ice Ball… By Shortyon, January 25, 2016Amazing.... We were skeptical; but, CLEAR ICE BALLS do take longer to melt - love it!By Robert Reeveon, Feb 23, 2017Perfect Ice Ball Every Time Always in search of the perfect ice ball maker, my search is over, this is as advertised the best, crystal clear 2.5"" ball, very easy to use.By Kirk Olson, July 6, 2017I love the drinks made with the ice ball.

Sadly at the early age of 17 doctors discovered that she had a brain tumor. During her fight with cancer her family had their friends from around the world shoot short positive energy  filled messages for Melike.(Video girls noktası) Unfortunately due to the cancer advancing through the vision center of brain, Melike wasn’t able to see the video. In 2012 at the young age of 18 she lost her battle. In an effort to give life and oxygen back to the planet in her memory, her family started the Melike Woods made up of 1000 trees.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Configure advanced workflows by setting up Flic with IFTTT, Zapier, Microsoft Flow or even the HTTP request function in our apps to command anything you can dream of. All of these are available in iOS, Android and Mac already, and will of course be available for the Flic Hub as well.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Did you know that Flic works perfectly with your Mac? You can also write your own plugins to the Mac app it order to extend its features.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Use Flic in your own App by implementing our Flic SDK for iOS and Android.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">If you know what you’re doing, you’ll recognize the structure of the Flic Hub. It’s basically an advanced Linux computer, much like a better-looking Raspberry Pi, with a two separate Bluetooth controllers (yep, two) for increased stability, excellent connectivity features and brilliant design. And yes, you can hack it as you please.</p>
<p><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497923711/cqcxsjtdmpdhcpiqda1v.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We’re not fooling around when it comes to security. No one has managed to break the Flic protocol, and trust us, they tried. The Flic hub security level is equally high. The Hub is password protected and can only be accessed with our App and the BLE communication between the two is SPAKE2+ encrypted. On the network side no ports are open to the outside world. All communication with our backend goes over TLS. That means no one will be able to reach your network from outside via the Flic Hub. Unless, of course, you give them your Hub password. Don’t do that.</p>

<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>What is the Flic Hub?</b></span></td>
<td>The Flic Hub is our latest product. It acts as a link between your Flic buttons and your connected devices and services. The beauty of the Hub is that you no longer have to rely on your phone as the gateway, giving you a much more reliable &amp; stable connection. It also comes with an optional IR accessory that allows you to control your TV, Set Top Box, HiFi sound system and much more directly from the Hub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>What is the Flic Hub App?</strong></td>
<td>The Flic Hub app is built into the existing Flic app and is only needed when you want to set up the click, double click and hold functions for each of your Flic buttons. You can also use the app to manage all your connected buttons and 3rd party service providers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Do I have to buy Flics in order for the Flic Hub to work?</strong></td>
<td>Yes, you will need to have a least 1 Flic in order to use the Hub. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>I have Flics already, will they work with the Hub or do I need to buy new Flics?</strong></td>
<td>Great! All Flics will work with the Hub!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Can all the actions in my current Flic App be used with Flic Hub?</strong></td>
<td>Most of the apps currently supported by Flic will be available on the Hub. Unfortunately phone specific actions such as send text message or hang up call will not work on the Hub, but if you still want these then connect the Flic to your phone :) As always we will be continually adding to the action list and partners which are supported so your Hub’s capabilities will continue to improve.</td>
</tr>

Unfortunately not all configurations will be available on the hub, e.g. phone specific actions such as send text message, or hang up call. Those that are compatible will be transferred once you pair the button to the Hub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Do I need to pair my other smart devices to the Flic Hub?</strong></td>
<td>Yes and no. The Hub will communicate with your other smart devices over a WiFi connection.

</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>I have a big house, can I purchase additional Hubs to extend my range? </strong></td>
<td>Yes. Each Hub has a range of around 100 feet (30m) so if you need to extend this then adding additional hubs is recommended. If you have a Flic that you keep on your keychain or wear around the house then simply pair it once with each Hub you own and it will ensure a seamless experience in any room, great for music control around the entire house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Can I power the Hub via a laptop or PC?</strong></td>
<td>Yes, however we recommend that you connect it directly to a wall outlet via a USB power adapter that is able to supply a minimum of 1A output. This will ensure that you have the best possible experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Can I connect the Hub directly to my router/network switch?</strong></td>
<td>Yes, you can connect an ethernet cable directly from the Hub to your router/network switch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Can I connect the Hub to my Bluetooth speaker?</strong></td>
<td>Yes! The Hub can connect to your speakers either with Bluetooth or with a standard 3.5mm Audio Jack cable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Can I connect the Hub to my WiFi speaker?</strong></td>
<td>Yes, no problem. As long as your WiFi speaker, e.g. a Sonos, is already setup and connected to a network then the Hub and Flic will be able to control it. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>What is IR and how can this control my TV, set top box, etc...? </strong></td>
<td>In a nutshell it means that a Flic can replace all your remote controls!<br/>IR means infrared and it's the way that old remote controls can communicate with TV’s, sound systems, air conditioners. We have developed an IR blaster accessory that you can connect to the hub that works like these old remote controls. This means you can clear the clutter on your coffee table and put all those old remote controls in the drawer as Flic can now replace them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Is the Hub safe?</strong></td>
<td>Yes, we take your privacy and security seriously so you can be sure that the Flic Hub will keep you and your smart home safe from threats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Adding such a device to my home network is a security risk, is the Hub protected?</strong></td>
<td>Yes the Hub is password protected keeping you and your smart home safe. Our protocol between the hub and the app uses both encryption and cryptographic signatures. On the network side no ports are open to the outside world. All communication with our backend goes over TLS. No other interface is used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Does the Flic Hub maintain a connection to my Flic buttons?</strong></td>
<td>Yes, once you pair a Flic to your Hub this will be remembered forever until you decide to disconnect it. This ensures that the Flic will work first time, every time with very low latency.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Will this constant connection drain my Flic button battery?</strong></td>
<td>No, Flic will go into sleep/passive mode when you are not using it and will wake up instantly when you press it. Flic and the Hub use BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) which consumes so little power that you can rest assured that your Flic will last for up to 18 months on a single battery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Can everyone in the house connect to the Flic Hub to control the devices?</strong></td>
<td>Once you connect a Flic to the Hub anyone in your house can use it! Your family, friends, even your dog! Each Hub will need to have an owner who links their partner/3rd party accounts to the Hub which can then be used by everyone else. The Hub itself is password protected so that only the owner can add new buttons and make changes unless they share the password to authorize others to do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>I currently use Flic through my smartphone to connect with my smart devices and have noticed some lag. Will the Hub fix this?</strong></td>
<td>Yes, we have worked extremely hard to improve this and the Hub will ensure a much more responsive experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Does the Flic Hub support zigbee/z-wave?</strong></td>
<td>The Flic Hub is not able to directly control ZigBee or Z-Wave devices but we do support several Smartlights, Smartlocks, etc.. through the local network and cloud (IFTTT). Also we’re constantly building support for more and more devices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>Does the Hub support Apple ‘Homekit’?</b></span></td>
<td>HomeKit will not be supported on the Hub at launch. We think it's great they have created a more open community by removing the MFI chip requirement. As such we will explore adding HomeKit in future software updates but we can't promise anything at this stage.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>What compatibility information is important to know?</strong></td>
<td>As long as you have WiFi or ethernet connected devices the the Hub can communicate with them. Some actions may not be directly listed in our app however through IFTTT many devices can be controlled via a Flic. <br/>The Hub can also communicate with Bluetooth classic devices and IR (infrared) however the connection range is limited.<br/>To setup and manage the Hub settings a Bluetooth connection is required, so you need to turn on the bluetooth on your phone.</td>

With the add-on IR accessory you can control TVs, home entertainment systems, & air conditioners to name a few. 


 

 
 


 

 
Combines WiFi, Bluetooth, and Infrared to control your outdoor & indoor home automation & entertainment devices.
 

 
 


 
Check out this video made by one of our top Flic Button users: 
 

 

 

 

 

 
The Flic Hub gives you a lot more control and flexibility when controlling your Flic buttons. 

 

 


 
 

 

 

 

 


 

Watch this Flic super-user show off how they've automated their home controls with Flic. 
 






 





 
 

 


Flic buttons will work up to 100 feet from the Hub. For comparison, the typical WiFi Router will work up to 150 feet. If you own multiple WiFi routers, then you should pre-order more Flic Hubs. You can pre-order as many as you need.


The Flic app lets you easily set up Flic button control.

New compatibility, better connectivity, and more control all packaged into a beautiful design.


 

 

Flic and the Flic Hub are highly customizable for the advanced user.

Configure advanced workflows by setting up Flic with IFTTT, Zapier, Microsoft Flow or even the HTTP request function in our apps to command anything you can dream of. All of these are available in iOS, Android and Mac already, and will of course be available for the Flic Hub as well.
Did you know that Flic works perfectly with your Mac? You can also write your own plugins to the Mac app it order to extend its features.
Use Flic in your own App by implementing our Flic SDK for iOS and Android.

If you know what you’re doing, you’ll recognize the structure of the Flic Hub. It’s basically an advanced Linux computer, much like a better-looking Raspberry Pi, with a two separate Bluetooth controllers (yep, two) for increased stability, excellent connectivity features and brilliant design. And yes, you can hack it as you please.

We’re not fooling around when it comes to security. No one has managed to break the Flic protocol, and trust us, they tried. The Flic hub security level is equally high. The Hub is password protected and can only be accessed with our App and the BLE communication between the two is SPAKE2+ encrypted. On the network side no ports are open to the outside world. All communication with our backend goes over TLS. That means no one will be able to reach your network from outside via the Flic Hub. Unless, of course, you give them your Hub password. Don’t do that.
Built entirely at our community's request, the Flic Hub has gone through numerous design iterations and development tests.
Shortcut Labs was founded out of the passion to make great technology simple. We are a bunch of brilliant engineers, creatives and entrepreneurs leading a hardware revolution from Stockholm, Sweden. There is one thing we do better than everyone else: Simplicity. 
We're coming back to Indiegogo after successfully raising over 800% of the Indiegogo funding goal for the Flic Smart Button in 2014. With years of improving Flic and shipping to thousands of customers worldwide, we're finally ready to reveal our latest product. The Flic Hub is finally here on Indiegogo, back where it all began. We hope you're as excited about it as we are.

How can I see if my order has been confirmed?
If you look under the ‘My Contributions’ tab located under your Indiegogo account then you will see if your order has been accepted and processed.

You will get a Black and White combo pack. For the 3 Flic Button orders it includes x1 Black + x2 White Flic Buttons. The 6 Flic Button orders will include x2 Black + x4 White Flic Button


How much is shipping for the IR accessory?
If you have purchased the $20 IR accessory perk in addition to the Hub perk then you will not be charged additional shipping. You will only pay the shipping cost associated with the Hub itself.


 


What is the Flic Hub?
The Flic Hub is our latest product. It acts as a link between your Flic buttons and your connected devices and services. The beauty of the Hub is that you no longer have to rely on your phone as the gateway, giving you a much more reliable & stable connection. It also comes with an optional IR accessory that allows you to control your TV, Set Top Box, HiFi sound system and much more directly from the Hub.


What is the Flic Hub App?
The Flic Hub app is built into the existing Flic app and is only needed when you want to set up the click, double click and hold functions for each of your Flic buttons. You can also use the app to manage all your connected buttons and 3rd party service providers.


Do I have to buy Flics in order for the Flic Hub to work?
Yes, you will need to have a least 1 Flic in order to use the Hub. 


I have Flics already, will they work with the Hub or do I need to buy new Flics?
Great! All Flics will work with the Hub!


Can all the actions in my current Flic App be used with Flic Hub?
Most of the apps currently supported by Flic will be available on the Hub. Unfortunately phone specific actions such as send text message or hang up call will not work on the Hub, but if you still want these then connect the Flic to your phone :) As always we will be continually adding to the action list and partners which are supported so your Hub’s capabilities will continue to improve.


Can one Flic Hub have multiple simultaneous users?
Yes. The Hub is perfect for the whole family to use and can support up to 64 simultaneous Flic connections at the same time.

How does the Flic Hub connect to my devices?

The Hub combines WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. 
Connect the Hub to your local WiFi network and it will be able to communicate with any other WiFi/Internet connected devices, both on your network and remotely.
Connect the Hub to your Bluetooth devices, such as Bluetooth speakers, and bring the Hub to life allowing it to play sounds (perfect for use as a doorbell).
Connect the optional IR accessory via the 3.5mm jack and control millions of legacy devices such as TV’s, Stereo Amplifiers, & Air Conditioners.



Will all my original/current Flic configurations be linked directly to the Hub?
Yes, to an extent. As long as you’re logged in via the same Flic account all of your Flic configurations should transfer over without you needing to reconfigure all your existing buttons. Unfortunately not all configurations will be available on the hub, e.g. phone specific actions such as send text message, or hang up call. Those that are compatible will be transferred once you pair the button to the Hub.


Do I need to pair my other smart devices to the Flic Hub?
Yes and no. The Hub will communicate with your other smart devices over a WiFi connection. As long as your other smart devices are correctly set up and connected to a network it will work seamlessly. If you want to connect Bluetooth devices to the Hub e.g. a Bluetooth speaker, then this can be done through the Flic app.

 

What is the range of the Flic Hub?
Up to 150 feet (45m) depending on the environment, indoors this is typically up to 100 feet (30m).


How do I connect my Flics to the Hub?

Download the Flic app, already available on the Apple App Store & Google Play Store
Once we start shipping you will then find a new tab for the Hub within our Flic App where you can pair your Flic buttons to the Hub.
After this pairing the phone is no longer needed unless you need to edit the button configuration.



How many Flics can I connect to the Flic Hub?
Up to 64 Flic Buttons, as of today. If you have a use case in mind that would require more reach out to us and we can see what we can do!


I have a big house, can I purchase additional Hubs to extend my range? 
Yes. Each Hub has a range of around 100 feet (30m) so if you need to extend this then adding additional hubs is recommended. If you have a Flic that you keep on your keychain or wear around the house then simply pair it once with each Hub you own and it will ensure a seamless experience in any room, great for music control around the entire house.


Can I power the Hub via a laptop or PC?
Yes, however we recommend that you connect it directly to a wall outlet via a USB power adapter that is able to supply a minimum of 1A output. This will ensure that you have the best possible experience.


Can I connect the Hub directly to my router/network switch?
Yes, you can connect an ethernet cable directly from the Hub to your router/network switch.


Can I connect the Hub to my Bluetooth speaker?
Yes! The Hub can connect to your speakers either with Bluetooth or with a standard 3.5mm Audio Jack cable.


Can I connect the Hub to my WiFi speaker?
Yes, no problem. As long as your WiFi speaker, e.g. a Sonos, is already setup and connected to a network then the Hub and Flic will be able to control it. 


What is IR and how can this control my TV, set top box, etc...? 
In a nutshell it means that a Flic can replace all your remote controls!IR means infrared and it's the way that old remote controls can communicate with TV’s, sound systems, air conditioners. We have developed an IR blaster accessory that you can connect to the hub that works like these old remote controls. This means you can clear the clutter on your coffee table and put all those old remote controls in the drawer as Flic can now replace them.


Is the Hub safe?
Yes, we take your privacy and security seriously so you can be sure that the Flic Hub will keep you and your smart home safe from threats.


Adding such a device to my home network is a security risk, is the Hub protected?
Yes the Hub is password protected keeping you and your smart home safe. Our protocol between the hub and the app uses both encryption and cryptographic signatures. On the network side no ports are open to the outside world. All communication with our backend goes over TLS. No other interface is used.


Does the Flic Hub maintain a connection to my Flic buttons?
Yes, once you pair a Flic to your Hub this will be remembered forever until you decide to disconnect it. This ensures that the Flic will work first time, every time with very low latency.


Will this constant connection drain my Flic button battery?
No, Flic will go into sleep/passive mode when you are not using it and will wake up instantly when you press it. Flic and the Hub use BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) which consumes so little power that you can rest assured that your Flic will last for up to 18 months on a single battery.


Can everyone in the house connect to the Flic Hub to control the devices?
Once you connect a Flic to the Hub anyone in your house can use it! Your family, friends, even your dog! Each Hub will need to have an owner who links their partner/3rd party accounts to the Hub which can then be used by everyone else. The Hub itself is password protected so that only the owner can add new buttons and make changes unless they share the password to authorize others to do this.


I currently use Flic through my smartphone to connect with my smart devices and have noticed some lag. Will the Hub fix this?
Yes, we have worked extremely hard to improve this and the Hub will ensure a much more responsive experience.


Does the Flic Hub support zigbee/z-wave?
The Flic Hub is not able to directly control ZigBee or Z-Wave devices but we do support several Smartlights, Smartlocks, etc.. through the local network and cloud (IFTTT). Also we’re constantly building support for more and more devices.


Does the Hub support Apple ‘Homekit’?
HomeKit will not be supported on the Hub at launch. We think it's great they have created a more open community by removing the MFI chip requirement. As such we will explore adding HomeKit in future software updates but we can't promise anything at this stage.

 

How many features and devices can I control with the Flic Hub?
As many as you’d like! Each Flic supports three actions: Click, Double Click and Hold. For each action you can assign a chain of events such as: Single click = Turn on TV, Turn on Lights, Start Coffee Brewer etc.


What compatibility information is important to know?
As long as you have WiFi or ethernet connected devices the the Hub can communicate with them. Some actions may not be directly listed in our app however through IFTTT many devices can be controlled via a Flic. The Hub can also communicate with Bluetooth classic devices and IR (infrared) however the connection range is limited.To setup and manage the Hub settings a Bluetooth connection is required, so you need to turn on the bluetooth on your phone.


Can I attach the Flic Hub to a surface, or is it a standing product?
Both! If you want to stick it somewhere then you can use the a double sided adhesive (optional accessory) that allows you to stick the Hub to any surface similar to Flic so you can stick it discretely behind the cabinet or under a table. The sticker is reusable and can be rinsed under water in case it gets dirty.


How is the Flic Hub powered?
The Hub is powered via a Micro USB cable so you can connect it to any USB outlet. We recommended that you use a 1A output to ensure the best experience.


Can I have my Flic Hub outside to control my outdoor devices?
The Hub is recommended as an indoor product only. You can still control any devices that are outside if they are connected to the same WiFi network though!


What is the size of the Hub?
85x50x15mm


What is the power consumption of the Flic Hub?
1.5 Watts (typical)


Does the Hub have a speaker built in?
No. The Hub has 3.5mm Audio Jack and Bluetooth so you can connect the Hub to any speaker of your choice.

 

How do I choose what to control?
In the Flic app we will have a new tab where you can see all your Hubs. Within this Hub tab you can connect and configure your Flics. It will be just as easy as it is now with the Flic app.


How will I know if the Flic is connected to my phone or my hub?

Within the Flic app we will have a new tab for the Hub.
Connect a Flic via the Hub tab and your Flics will connect to your Hub
Connect a Flic via the Flic tab and your Flics will connect to your phone
It’s as simple as that!



I’ve found a software bug (something is not working/functioning strangely), how can I report this?
We really appreciate your feedback on these issues as it makes Flic and the app better for everyone. Please send us a quick email at support@shortcutlabs.com and we will take a look.


The app is only in English, do you have any language options?
We only support the App in English at this time, but stay tuned for further updates.

 

I want to integrate my device with the Flic Hub, can I do that?
We are working on how we can open the Hub for you to build your own plugins, stay tuned!


I want to run my own software on the hub, how can I do this?
Once we’ve build support for 3rd party plugins you’ll be able to run your own software as a plugin.


I have an idea to use Flic Hub in my business, who do I contact?
We love to hear you new and exciting ideas. Please send an email to support@shortcutlabs.com with your idea or use case! Our CTO will review these and get back to you with more info.

</div></div>","Sheet pan cooking is the easiest and most efficient way of making a delicious homemade meal.There are lots of ways to cook on a sheet pan, but they are often wasteful or messy and not everything takes the same amount of time to cook.We knew there had to be a better way...Introducing Cheat Sheets, a completely new approach to sheet pan cooking.  Oven-safe, non-stick silicone dividers that will streamline your cooking and divide your ingredients, to make one-pan meals and meal prepping a breeze.
Everyone loves sheet pan cooking, but it’s not always as simple as putting everything in the oven together and coming back to find it has all cooked evenly. Reality is, not everything takes the same amount of time to cook. With Cheat Sheets, you can easily remove ingredients when they're ready and never overcook them again.We get it... If you're new to oven cooking, it can feel like a bit of a science experiment that involves a lot of guesswork. That's why we've tested the most popular everyday ingredients and created an easy timing guide so that you’ll get perfect results every time.


Cheat Sheets are made for meal prep. With our modular dividers, you can cook all of your ingredients with even better organization and control. 
You can fit up to 6x small portions or 3x large portions on a single sheet pan and with multiple sets, you'll have everything you need to prep for the family or a week's worth of meals.


With Cheat Sheets you can easily separate ingredients and flavors without having them mingle. Whether you want to use different marinades, cook savory and sweet dishes at the same time, or simply don’t want your food to touch, Cheat Sheets has you covered.
Separation also comes in handy for families with different preferences, allowing you to create different portions for those with special dietary requirements or specific tastes - because not everybody likes pineapple on their pizza.


Aluminum foil and parchment paper are hugely wasteful and non-recyclable. Sheet pans are also notoriously difficult to clean, collecting stains and grime with every meal.
With Cheat Sheets you'll never have to scrub another sheet pan again and you'll save tonnes of wasted paper and foil. Cheat Sheets are naturally non-stick so clean-up is a breeze. They're also dishwasher safe!





The Cheat Sheets dividers are made with a premium, food-grade silicone material resistant to temperatures up to 450 degrees F. The dividers will fit on a standard half sheet pan or perfectly on the Prepd Sheet Pan included with each set.
The Prepd Sheet Pan is made from Carbon Steel and coated with a non-stick PTFE and PFOA free coating.

What differentiates the existing mocha pot from the Essopot?</strong><br/>The biggest difference is that there is an manual extraction valve. The water does not pass through the tank immediately, and when the valve is opened, it creates a dark-concentrated espresso and crema at a higher temperature and pressure. If you leave the valve open, it acts just the same as normal moka pot. However, if you close the the valve and open it once heated you can get a more rich flavored espresso just like a high-end espresso machine.<br/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603423125/jptwrpdgwoebeqapjzxq.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/><strong>Q2. Any advisory for future Essopot users?</strong><br/>I think Essopot is a sensational outbreak like Dyson in the coffee world. I hope you can enjoy and use the Essopot with your various ideas. The more you use it, the more you'll like it. Whether at home or outdoors, you can enjoy this amazing espresso anytime, anywhere along with latte art.<br/><br/>Try adding a spoonful of sugar on your crema-filled espresso every morning.<br/>Enjoy a cup of Americano full of crema when you are studying or working.<br/><br/><strong>Q3. Lastly, please send words of support to Epoproduct and Essopot</strong><br/>""Thank you so much"" is the first thing I want to say.<br/>Thank you for making this wonderful work.<br/>Because it's not just a coffee item, it's a work of art.<br/>I have no doubt that Epoh product will be loved all over the world beyond Korea.<br/>Essopot will bring happy lives to many coffee lovers all over the world.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602491182/e24i17ohzdf47ncq2exx.png"" src=""""/></p><div> </div><div><div style=""text-align: center;"">

World Latte Championship Winner Um Paul!
We had the chance to meet Um Paul to review our product and this is how it went:Q1. What differentiates the existing mocha pot from the Essopot?The biggest difference is that there is an manual extraction valve. The water does not pass through the tank immediately, and when the valve is opened, it creates a dark-concentrated espresso and crema at a higher temperature and pressure. If you leave the valve open, it acts just the same as normal moka pot. However, if you close the the valve and open it once heated you can get a more rich flavored espresso just like a high-end espresso machine.Q2. Any advisory for future Essopot users?I think Essopot is a sensational outbreak like Dyson in the coffee world. I hope you can enjoy and use the Essopot with your various ideas. The more you use it, the more you'll like it. Whether at home or outdoors, you can enjoy this amazing espresso anytime, anywhere along with latte art.Try adding a spoonful of sugar on your crema-filled espresso every morning.Enjoy a cup of Americano full of crema when you are studying or working.Q3. Lastly, please send words of support to Epoproduct and Essopot""Thank you so much"" is the first thing I want to say.Thank you for making this wonderful work.Because it's not just a coffee item, it's a work of art.I have no doubt that Epoh product will be loved all over the world beyond Korea.Essopot will bring happy lives to many coffee lovers all over the world. 

 






 








 

 












 



Espresso Machine: At a pressure of 9 BAR the temperature is at 90 Degrees Essopot: At a pressure of 5 BAR the temperature is at 150 DegreesBoth have an extraction of approximately 20%

 
 

 
A delicious latte perfect with desserts.

<p>Nothing…and I mean nothing is as frustrating as watching the freshly-cleaned vegetables and fruits you just rinsed fall into the sink AFTER you’ve rinsed them. Even worse, if you don’t have a good grip on your items, they can ALL fall back into the sink – taking your sanity with them.</p>

<h1>Story. Team. Development. Future.</h1>
<p>My name is Ann and I’ve been working in design for eight years. I’ve graduated twice and worked my way from the position of a common designer to art director. My husband Tim is an engineer and likes inventing. Together we’ve come up with Equilibric.</p>

<p>Me and Tim were born in the countryside, and despite growing up in an urban area, we always preferred home food over fast food l, which bears no benefit or proper nutrients, often being harmful. So we cook home a lot and try to ease doing so process as much as possible.</p>
<p>Four years ago I had the idea to improve the typical colander design, after having bought all kinds of them in stores, inspired by design of various items and inventions, from spoons to airplanes. So I took a pencil and got to draw.</p>

</div>","Nothing…and I mean nothing is as frustrating as watching the freshly-cleaned vegetables and fruits you just rinsed fall into the sink AFTER you’ve rinsed them. Even worse, if you don’t have a good grip on your items, they can ALL fall back into the sink – taking your sanity with them.










The Equilibric colander reduces the amount of water needed to wash your fruits and vegetables by 60% - all while removing twice as many contaminants! You will never have to worry about items in the sink again because this design saves you time and frustration.















Its ergonomic design keeps the vegetables upright and safe as the water bowl drains the dirty water away, cleaning your foods and keeping your clean items safe from spillage.































The colander also serves as a great serving dish for you.  You don’t have to worry about using more dishes than necessary just because you need something to put them in afterwards.  Drain the excess water from your vegetables - and serve your fruits or salads in the same dish.




















Trying to defrost something at room temperature turns into a huge problem for most cooks.  Water often winds up all over the counter creating an even bigger mess, and more work for you.





With typical colanders, lots of dirt and other contaminates can transfer to your clean serving dishes.  But with the Equilibric colander, its washing machine motion helps remove 90% of the dirt and bacteria from your foods – giving you a healthier, more nutrient rich meal!

























As you can see, the Equilibric colander saves you time and energy.  It’s also incredibly efficient, sanitary, and environmentally conscious.  Moreover it saves extra money on your water bill.





















Equilibric has a very well considered hole slots pattern that allows to drain the excess water fast and simple. Equilibric Bowl is made from a high quality polypropylene which is an unharmful material to dine from. Equilibric Bowl design has a special spin system which uses the force of gravity to speed up all kitchen tasks.


















































Story. Team. Development. Future.
My name is Ann and I’ve been working in design for eight years. I’ve graduated twice and worked my way from the position of a common designer to art director. My husband Tim is an engineer and likes inventing. Together we’ve come up with Equilibric.





Me and Tim were born in the countryside, and despite growing up in an urban area, we always preferred home food over fast food l, which bears no benefit or proper nutrients, often being harmful. So we cook home a lot and try to ease doing so process as much as possible.
Four years ago I had the idea to improve the typical colander design, after having bought all kinds of them in stores, inspired by design of various items and inventions, from spoons to airplanes. So I took a pencil and got to draw.











Thanks to Tim, my sketches and concepts came to life as working prototypes.



























The most problematic part was talking to various China-based factories. We were sending the design and info over, but struggled with communication problems. But ultimately, we found a manufacturer and a manager that helped us on this stage after it had stretched on for a while.





Two years ago, Sabina joined us as a co-founder, responsible for communications and marketing. Without her, we wouldn’t have been able to make it to Kickstarter and organize everything.





We’re really grateful to Inpixel, the company that took care of the video material for us, delivering calmly great results despite my quite extensive list of requests.





Our future plans is to introduce a brand new type of colander for enthusiasts and kitchen professionals. I promise, you haven’t seen anything like it before, and we’ll be showcasing it on Kickstarter right from the concept stage! We’re also creating a USB-powered heating food container, which might possible have its own battery.





Our global goal is to create a brand of smart kitchen gadgets and food containers (both with and without heating) for carrying your dishes.
Please help us bring our plans to life, and become part of Equilibric!

<p> </p></figure></div></div>","“I can’t believe we’ve put a man on the moon, yet we use a poo stick to clean the toilet.”FlushBrush is a replacement for your horrible toilet brush. It’s a new take on toilet cleaning. Every other object in your bathroom has modernised, become more convenient and more hygienic, except the toilet brush! The design of the toilet brush has remained the same since the invention of the modern toilet, and most of us keep them within 1 meter of our toothbrushes.This really has to change. The FlushBrush brings toilet cleaning into the 21st century.   The FlushBrush is more hygienic in three key ways. 
The silicone head repels water and waste, unlike bristled brushes. 
The head is stored inside the toilet, with water passing over it with every flush; nothing that touches the inside of the toilet ever leaves the toilet. 
The head can be replaced whenever you want to, making it easier to maintain your standard of cleanliness in the bathroom. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 To use the FlushBrush, just pick up the handle from the base, push to connect the head in the cradle and lift it out to start cleaning. When you’re done, position the head back into the cradle, and pull back on the handle trigger to release the head. The cradle has a magnet in it to keep the head secure. Replace the handle in the base and job done!  
 To install the FlushBrush in your bathroom, lift the toilet lid and position the cradle tightly under the rim of the toilet to ensure maximum water coverage. Once the forks of the cradle are tightly under the rim, fold back the flexible aluminium strip around your toilet bowl, moulding the FlushBrush cradle into place to perfectly fit your toilet. 
 
The FlushBrush cleaning head is stored discreetly underneath the flow of water, cleaning the head with each flush. As you routinely use your toilet, the water passing over it will dislodge anything that wasn’t repelled by the silicone cleaning surface, and the regular flows of water will prevent bacteria buildup by flushing the whole system each time you use the toilet.
 FlushBrush's silicone cleaning head repels water and dirt, and has been specifically designed to avoid having any dirt traps. Silicone is an extremely hydrophobic material, meaning water and dirty substances can hardly stick to it – it’s often used in high quality cooking and medical tools to ensure the highest standards of hygiene. This makes silicone the perfect material for FlushBrush's cleaning head. 
FlushBrush’s handle only ever makes indirect contact with the inside of the toilet bowl. Anything that makes direct contact with waste stays inside the bowl, and is rinsed with fresh water every time you flush. No transferring of dripping toilet juices from bowl to holder like with a traditional toilet brush. 
We’ve heard stories of children and dogs running around the house waving toilet brushes, spreading germs and bleach all over the home. With FlushBrush, you can store the handle out of reach, and even if someone does get hold of it, you can be sure it’s never made direct contact with the inside of the bowl. In addition, there’s no need to routinely sterilise the handle in bleach, so there’s no risk that anyone will spill a pot of chemicals (and poo!) over the floor of your bathroom... 
 
FlushBrush saves water. The silicone head is cleaned routinely during normal use of your toilet, so there’s no need to flush especially to clean (as you might with a bristled brush). With each toilet flush using an average of 1.6gallons/6 litres of water, saving on those unnecessary flushes will really add up.FlushBrush saves on chemical usage. Traditional bristled brushed need to be regularly disinfected with bleach, which is flushed down drains and into the environment. FlushBrush uses the water already flowing over it to stay clean, reducing the need for disinfecting chemicals.FlushBrush wastes less plastic. When you want to change your bristled toilet brush, you need to throw away the whole thing - at least 100g of plastic straight into the bin. With FlushBrush, only the cleaning head needs occasional replacing, and it weighs just 2g of plastic. This means you can still maintain your standards of hygiene without all the unnecessary waste.  
 
 With FlushBrush, the only part stored outside of the toilet is the handle itself. Each reward tier comes with a free floor base stand, and we will make a wall bracket an option for all backers to add to their order once the campaign ends if we reach £100k! You asked and I listened! Now we've hit £50k in funding the DARK GREY FlushBrush will be available to choose during the address survey at the end of the campaign! For backers ordering multiple units, you'll be able to decide on the colour for each of them between white and dark grey.

""The design is simple, sleek and relentlessly practical."" Huffington Post
""As a renter I don't want to buy a Nest or any other device that I would need to wire into the wall. "" Gigaom

 
 
Switchmate has been in the works for well over a year. After multiple rounds of prototyping, testing, and getting feedback from homeowners, renters, and interior designers, we believe we've settled on an elegant design.

    ""Very easy. No problems installing or operating it."" - Troy""I have my device and I love it. Works perfectly. I installed it in seconds on my front porch lights. Then I moved it to my swamp cooler which has a heavy switch. The magnets and motor were strong enough to use it on my cooler. I want more units. Simple and easy."" -Travis""At first using it for turning lights and ceiling fans off and on. I will eventually want additional switches to automate lights turning on while not at home."" -Eric""I loved being able to turn the lights off from my bed."" -Ricardo""I no longer have to argue with my wife over who turns the lights off!"" -Anonymous

The light that makes places safer by brightening up areas all around the home so you can see inside closets and in places where your normal lighting can’t reach.AutoLight is Easy to useEasy to installEasy to chargeEasy to maintainAll AutoLights use motion sensors, so they can be configured to light up when you are near and need them, and switch off again when you don’t. It makes them great for safety purposes, like when you need to see around the house at night but don’t want to wake everyone up, and certainly don’t want to be tripping over things you can’t see in the dark. Our Story Light is vital to our lives. But, despite the advent of electricity, there are still plenty of places around every house or workplace that remain dark. Yes, you could get an electrician to wire-up new lights in these dark places. But it’s an expensive process that will add more to your electricity bill.The fact is, we only need lights when there’s someone there who needs to see. And that’s what makes Auto Light’s motion sensors and portability such a gamechanger.If you’re worried about having to walk around the house in the dark at night and fear stumbling over things you can’t see, AutoLights are the answer. If you’re struggling to find what you’re looking for in a dark cupboard, corner of a room, or garage, AutoLights are the answer. They will help stop you having accidents, and prevent you needing to use one hand to hold a flashlight to find that something you’re looking for in the closet, garage, attic or cellar. AutoLight Uses The Latest Motion Sensor Technology: Whenever you approach an AutoLight, it will turn on for you.

HERE ARE OUR TOP 5 REASONS!</strong></p><p><strong>1. COOLING MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS</strong> - There have been numerous experiments done on humans to show the benefits of a memory foam mattress over a spring mattress. Memory foam has far better weight distribution which relieves pressure and has orthopaedic benefits for your dog. </p><p>There are other memory foam dog beds on the market but most are made with cheap and dense memory foam which actually traps heat leading to an uncomfortable nights sleep. Our cooling foam uses a brand new technology which has cooling properties, high ventilation and allows the dog to regulate its core temperature, resulting in a peaceful nights sleep.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477918223/ef4z1wkahnbsfzzsal6k.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477918292/c9dildw5abeq2yojyu91.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477918078/lbwakdcfnrky2fcm8irl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/><strong>2. NANO-COATING</strong> - We have coated all of our beds with a unique, environmentally friendly and non-toxic nano-coating which ensures our beds are stain, odor and liquid resistant. The coating extends the life of the product and protects the bed from a build up of dust mites which are a leading cause of dog allergies and health problems. It also protects the bed from mould and bacteria penetrating the fabric which makes it not only hygienic but it will also reduce the build up of dog odors.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477308578/ewr7m3pjm9tgpdn0st10.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img alt=""Image and video hosting by TinyPic"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i64.tinypic.com/316wa3t.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>3. THE COVER AND FABRIC </strong>- We have picked a material that is the perfect blend of soft and tough. Soft so it is super comfy for your dog to sleep on but also tough enough to withstand 20,000 rub cycles without alteration to the color or quality. We have applied a high quality zip at the back of the bed which means the covers are easily removable and are machine washable.

HERE ARE OUR TOP 5 REASONS!1. COOLING MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS - There have been numerous experiments done on humans to show the benefits of a memory foam mattress over a spring mattress. Memory foam has far better weight distribution which relieves pressure and has orthopaedic benefits for your dog. There are other memory foam dog beds on the market but most are made with cheap and dense memory foam which actually traps heat leading to an uncomfortable nights sleep. Our cooling foam uses a brand new technology which has cooling properties, high ventilation and allows the dog to regulate its core temperature, resulting in a peaceful nights sleep.2. NANO-COATING - We have coated all of our beds with a unique, environmentally friendly and non-toxic nano-coating which ensures our beds are stain, odor and liquid resistant. The coating extends the life of the product and protects the bed from a build up of dust mites which are a leading cause of dog allergies and health problems. It also protects the bed from mould and bacteria penetrating the fabric which makes it not only hygienic but it will also reduce the build up of dog odors. 3. THE COVER AND FABRIC - We have picked a material that is the perfect blend of soft and tough. Soft so it is super comfy for your dog to sleep on but also tough enough to withstand 20,000 rub cycles without alteration to the color or quality. We have applied a high quality zip at the back of the bed which means the covers are easily removable and are machine washable. Once the campaign is over you will also be able to buy covers separately so you can change the look of your bed throughout the seasons.   4. HANDMADE IN GREAT BRITAIN – Most dog beds cut corners when it comes to quality and many are made in the Far East. All of our products are handmade in Great Britain at our factory in the heart of Wales using premium hardware and skilled upholsterers who have been in the profession for generations and have a huge amount of experience to draw upon. To back up our promise of quality we are offering a 2 year warranty on any Ralph and Co product. 5. THE DESIGN - For the design of the bed we have consulted with both top product and interior designers. For the shape of the bed we decided to put in walls around the side to satisfy a dog's natural instinct to feel protected as well as being a super comfy place to rest their heads.  OUR INITIAL 6 DESIGNSFor the patterns on the bed we are launching an initial 6 designs so there is hopefully something for everyone. 1.

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>What is Celliant®? </strong></p>
<p>Celliant® is a revolutionary, patented technology that, through the use of fibers, converts the body’s natural energy (heat) into infrared (IR) light and emits it into the body’s tissue and muscles. The result is a responsive textile clinically proven to benefit the human body, utilizing a blend of minerals and proprietary ingredients embedded into the fiber’s core.</p>
<p><strong>How does Celliant® work?</strong></p>
<p>Celliant® is a revolutionary, patented technology that, through the use of fibers, converts the body’s natural energy (heat) into infrared (IR) light and emits it into the body’s tissue and muscles. The result is a responsive textile clinically proven to benefit the human body, utilizing a blend of minerals and proprietary ingredients embedded into the fiber’s core.</p>
<p><strong>What is Celliant® made from?</strong></p>
<p>Celliant® is a unique blend of 13 thermo-reactive minerals including titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide. Additional proprietary ingredients are blended with polyester fiber to create a variety of staple fibers, spun and filament yarns, and fabric blends .</p>
<p><strong>Will I feel Celliant® working?</strong></p>
<p>While you will not necessarily be able to perceive or feel an increase in circulation, oxygenation or blood flow, clinical testing has measured an increase in skin oxygen levels (TCPO2) and consistently recorded significant improvements across a wide spectrum of test subjects. Consumers who try Celliant® often experience increased comfort and an overall improved sense of health.</p>
<p><strong>Does Celliant® have to touch my skin for a heightened effect?</strong></p>
<p>Products enhanced with Celliant technology can be covered or layered without losing effectiveness. Clothing, sheets, and laminated or waterproof fabrics do not hinder the efficacy of Celliant® to recycle energy to the body. The body’s electromagnetic emissions travel through clothing, wood, glass and even concrete. The energy your body emits is the same that’s seen in technology used by the military to view humans inside buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Will my skin temperature increase if I'm reusing my body's energy?</strong></p>
<p>No, by re-emitting energy back into the body, the process acts as a thermal regulator to help balance body temperature. When circulation is increased, the body is able to either warm up or cool down, depending on the external environment, more easily through convection.</p>
<p><strong>Will the Celliant® lose its effectiveness over time?</strong></p>
<p>No, the Celliant® will hold its strength over time (i.e., it will not wash out).</p>
<p><strong>How do I care for The Infinity Blanket?</strong></p>
<p>Wash cold and tumble dry low.</p>
<p><strong>What are the dimensions of the Infinity Blanket?</strong></p>
<p>60 x 80 inches.</p>
<p><b>How much does the Infinity Blanket weigh?</b></p>
<p>2.25 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Infinity Blanket made of?</strong></p>
<p>The blanket is a blend of 28% Celliant Fiber and 72% Organic Cotton.</p>
<p><strong>Where is the Infinity Blanket made?</strong></p>
<p>The blanket is imported from Germany and is made from organic and recycled materials.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you source your materials from?</strong></p>
<p>The certified organic cotton yarn is sourced from multiple places in Europe, and the Celliant® yarn is made in Spain.</p>
<p><strong>What type of stitching is along the edge?</strong></p>
<p>The outer edge is lined with a whip stitch.</p>
<p><strong>How is the Infinity Blanket different than others?</strong></p>
<p>Other materials will try and insulate heat, while still allowing it to escape. The Celliant® fibers imbedded into The Infinity Blanket recycle your body's heat in the form of infrared light. The infrared light opens your blood vessels, creating a vasodilation effect. This process expands your blood vessels, which increases your tissue oxygen levels. Higher oxygen levels equal more fuel for your body, aiding in recovering and pain management.</p>
<p><strong>When is the best time to use the Infinity Blanket?</strong></p>
<p>Any time – after a workout, a yoga session, long day of skiing or snowboarding, or even on a long plane flight. You can also use it at your office desk if your colleagues like to crank up the AC. Your options are endless here. Snuggle up!</p>
<p><strong>Can I use the Infinity Blanket outdoors?</strong></p>
<p>It is best to use the blanket indoors, but if you would like to use it outside, be mindful of where you place it.</p>
<p><strong>Is the Infinity Blanket water resistant?</strong></p>
<p>The blend we chose consists of organic cotton and, as such, is not water resistant.</p>
<p><strong>Does the Infinity Blanket retain heat?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, in fact the blanket recycles your body’s natural energy (heat) into infrared light keeping you comfortably warm.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be multiple color and size options?</strong></p>
<p>Currently this is the only color and size option, however if this campaign is successful, we are planning to introduce new colors and sizes.</p>

</div></div>","Yaasa Infinity Blanket The first blanket that increases local blood flow, aids recovery, and enhances rest with Celliant® fiber technology. The Yaasa Studios Infinity Blanket is the first to use Celliant® fibers to benefit your body. As summer comes to an end and cooler weather is around the corner, now is the perfect time to layer up!  Whether you're an athlete looking for a recovery trick, a yogi seeking wellness and comfort during resting poses, or simply someone who's looking to improve sleep, The Yaasa Studios Infinity Blanket is perfect for you. 

CELLIANT® TECHNOLOGY - Celliant® is blended into organic cotton to create a revolutionary fabric that increases energy levels in healthy individuals.

FDA DETERMINED - Celliant® fiber has been clinically tested and is now determined by the FDA for medical uses*.

ECO-FRIENDLY MATERIALS - The Infinity Blanket is manufactured with green practices in Europe and uses certified organic cotton. Up to 12 plastic water bottles are recycled in the production of each blanket.
We believe your blanket should do more for you, so we created one that absorbs and recycles body energy without compromising design or comfort. 
 With Celliant® fibers that improve health, organic materials that are top-tier, and design that refuses to compromise, The Yaasa Studios Infinity Blanket is different from the rest. Use the Celliant® fibers woven into the Infinity Blanket to decrease recovery time, increase local blood flow, and promote restful sleep.  
 It's the world's most innovative blanket, backed by scientific studies.    The Yaasa Studios Infinity Blanket increases local blood flow, energy, strength, and endurance using Celliant® technology.  IR has a vasodilator effect which expands blood vessels, increases energy levels, enhances cell vitality, and regulates body temperature. Higher energy levels equal more fuel for your body, aiding in recovery. Celliant® is revolutionary, patented technology that recycles the body's natural energy (heat) into infrared (IR) light that is emitted back into the body's tissue.   Infrared is widely recognized for having positive effects on the body. The use of Celliant® fibers converts the body’s natural energy (heat) into infrared (IR) light and emits it into the body’s muscles. Over 60% of your consumed energy is lost simply through heat escaping your body.    Rather than trap your body heat, Celliant® turns that wasted energy into infrared light. The result is a responsive textile clinically proven to benefit the human body:
increase energy, endurance, stamina and performance
recover faster from physical activity
promote restful sleep and increased comfort.   

The Infinity Blanket blends Celliant® material with organic cotton to create a fabric that recycles and emits infrared light. On average, your body emits 100 watts of energy in a given moment. The Infinity Blanket is a unique way of taking advantage of that energy! 
 

Celliant® fiber is a different kind of performance technology and is CE recognized and FDA determined for its medical benefits and uses. 
 
The FDA has determined that Celliant® products are medical devices as defined in section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and are general wellness products.
Celliant® fiber is CE recognized in Europe for its medical purposes and aid in healing through infrared (IR) light increasing the metabolic rate to provide more energy at a cellular level. It's also used to ease symptoms of various vascular and sleep conditions because of it's ability to improve oxygenation. 
 

 
Third party clinical trials have proven the effectiveness of Celliant® technology, with studies conducted at top tier universities, including University of California Irvine, University of Calgary, UC Long Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Texas A&M University, and Loyola University Chicago.
 

 
Hospitals and doctors commonly use infrared light as a therapeutic treatment for conditions ranging from high blood pressure and congestive heart failure to muscle tears and rheumatoid arthritis.
 

Increase local blood flow, suppor heat generation, and recycle your energy with high volume of Celliant®.
 

 
Celliant® technology has been used in a number of different products, like clothing and bedding, to help users reach their full wellness potential. The transformation of your body's expelled energy to infrared light boosts your local blood flow to increase energy levels and deliver nutrients through your bloodstream.
 

 
The infrared light stimulates cell growth and regeneration to help heal injuries more quickly, reduce pain, and amplify your endurance. The increased local blood flow allows your body to better manage your internal temperature and fall asleep faster-- 15 minutes faster in pilot studies!

<p><em><strong>However, there is hope in the Northern Virginia community. </strong></em></p>
<p>For the past 25 years, Borromeo Housing, Inc., an education-first, transitional housing community, has been working to help Arlington's teen mom's beat the odds.  Borromeo Housing provides a stable environment and a supportive community for the mothers and children while helping the resident mothers finish their education, learn life skills and reach their potential. </p>

<p>This year, Rebuilding Together Arlington/Fairfax/Falls Church has teamed up with the Arlington Teen Network Board for the <strong>""Raise the Roof""</strong> project.  The project will provide the Borromeo Housing Inc. group house with much needed repairs and modifications, in addition to providing additional resources for the mothers.</p>

<p>We don’t always have time for breakfast when we get up in the morning. Even cereal, the quickest of meals, can be a challenge when you’re trying to beat the clock. You might be one of the many people that skips breakfast entirely — those days are over. We couldn’t believe there wasn’t a viable option to eat your cereal on-the-go, so we made one, and it’s awesome. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>We set out to create a portable cereal cup that does not mess around. We don't play that soggy cereal nonsense. Which is why it's a two cup system; one for the cereal and the other for the milk. The cereal and milk don't meet until they hit your mouth.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>For the first time, cereal is ultra-portable. You'll never have to dangerously juggle a bowl of cereal in the car or throw cheerios and milk into a dixie cup. Come'on now, we have to share the road with you!</p>

Even cereal, the quickest of meals, can be a challenge when you’re trying to beat the clock. You might be one of the many people that skips breakfast entirely — those days are over. We couldn’t believe there wasn’t a viable option to eat your cereal on-the-go, so we made one, and it’s awesome. 
 

 
We set out to create a portable cereal cup that does not mess around. We don't play that soggy cereal nonsense. Which is why it's a two cup system; one for the cereal and the other for the milk. The cereal and milk don't meet until they hit your mouth.
 

 
For the first time, cereal is ultra-portable. You'll never have to dangerously juggle a bowl of cereal in the car or throw cheerios and milk into a dixie cup. Come'on now, we have to share the road with you!
 

 
Enjoy your cereal on your own time, prep it the night before and get those kids out the door.

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>Wassaic Community Farm was founded by farmer Benjamin Schwartz seven years ago after he grew frustrated about the lack of access to good quality produce in the South Bronx where he lived. Food Justice is Farmer Ben's passion and, after four years as a community garden activist in the South Bronx, he moved to Wassaic, NY, about two hours north of New York City and created Wassaic Community Farm.</p>
<p>Seven years later our small farm boasts a dedicated crew of six and sells produce in two markets in New York City (Bushwick, Brooklyn and the South Bronx) and one in Millerton near Wassaic. We also run a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) program that delivers a box of fresh produce to our customers each week and supply our own farm stand in Wassaic. <br/></p>
<p>We use no pesticides or other chemicals on our farm and we practice sustainable growing and harvesting methods.<br/></p>
<p>We have a number of non-profit partners including Victory Bus Rides, an organization that provides transportation to families of incarcerated people who wish to visit their family members in prison. Their bus ride includes a box of fresh, local, pesticide-free produce from our farm.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>We Have Lost Our Housing <br/>
</h3>
<p>A kind family near our farm 
offered us their house for kitchen, bathroom and shower facilities but 
now they need the house back! We have two RVs
 that we planned to renovate for housing with money we earned over the next year. However, 
with time being of the essence, we need money now to do 
the job much faster. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>We need building materials to renovate the RVs and money to pay professionals do to the work we cannot do ourselves. Our needs include: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Plywood</li>
<li>Roofing Material</li>
<li>Hardware</li>
<li>Non-pilot light propane stove with full oven<br/>
</li>
<li>Plumbing material</li>
<li>A solar shower</li>

<li>Name the RVs: Here is your chance to be immortalized on an RV! <br/>
</li>
<li>Weekend at the farm: Hang out with us! We will give you the royal treatment with garden tours, a trip to our swimming hole and, of course, lots of wonderful fresh, local, pesticide free produce.</li>

<li>Best of all, knowing that you have helped us help others<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Without shelter and facilities our farmers will have nowhere to sleep or eat, shower or use the bathroom. Our farm will literally have to shut down. This means we can't continue to do our food justice work serving communities that don't otherwise have access to high quality produce and herbs. We really need your help to complete this season and continue the work that we are so passionate about.<br/></p> <ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> We already had plans to renovate the RVs. Farmer Mike, our infrastructure guru, was to complete the project with our help over the next year. We have full confidence that we have access to the people-power and knowledge necessary to complete the renovation. Our main challenge is getting enough money to complete the project much faster than we had anticipated. Being able to purchase all of our supplies at once enables us to have basic facilities up and running by the time we need to leave the house we have been using and to fully complete the renovation shortly thereafter.<br/></p> <ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Maybe you don't have money. You can still help! <br/></p> <ul>
<li>We will gladly accept in-kind donations. Do you have left over building material? We'll take it! Camping equipment you no longer use? We'd be glad for it!</li>

<p>In most current systems this heat energy is simply poured down the drain with the effluent water.

<div> <h3>The Solution</h3>
</div>
<p>Energy Saver (Patent Pending) will recycle over 75% of the waste heat energy back into the incoming water. Energy Saver fixes two universal problems that have been overlooked for many years. First, the system quickly pays for itself in reduced energy consumption and second, it can eliminate the need to introduce potable water to temper the exiting hot effluent water, thereby saving both energy and drinking water. It is a smart controller-driven system so the energy savings is maximized.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Whilst preparing for this campaign we conducted a detailed risk 
assessment and have in time mitigated all of these risks, so far. The 
major risks were:</p>
<p>1. Production
<br/>2. Sustainable Sourcing
<br/>3. RGB Technology
<br/>4. Energy Consumption</p>
<p>We have developed many iterations of the Zencube which we have tested
 and improved to a high standard. We now have fully functional models 
which are ready for production.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have years of personal experience developing high
 quality, life-enhancing premium products. Therefore we have a strict 
protocol, methodology and processes that we follow for every development
 that we undertake.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<b>How do you clean it? </b>
</div>
<div>
<p>Take a slightly damp towel, and wipe the crystal gently, starting from the top to the bottom.</p>
<b>How heavy is it?</b>
</div>
<div>3.8kg - 8.3lbs<br/>
</div>
<div><b>Does it make any noise? </b></div>
<div>No.</div>
<div><b>How long does Zencube last? </b></div>
<div>Given the Zencube doesn't melt - as long as they are not immersed in 
water at all (it is salt and therefore will dissolve) in theory, you 
should never have to replace your lamp. In reality however, we 
acknowledge there will always be general wear and tear etc - so a fairly
 good estimate would be at least 4-5 years, if not more.<br/>
</div>
<div><b>How long does the bulb last? </b></div>
<div>The RGB LED bulbs are known for low energy consumption and for being 
long lasting. The bulbs should last between 20,000 to 30,000 hours.<br/>
</div>
<div><b>How do you store this lamp?</b></div>
<div>It's best to leave lamps on 24/7 for optimal results but to store them 
for long periods, wrap in plastic or use the plastic zipper bag 
provided.<br/>
</div>
<div><b>What devices will the app work with?</b></div>
<div>
<p>Zencube can connect to iOS or Android phones and tablets that have Bluetooth v4.0 or later.</p>
<b>Will the plug work in my country? </b>
</div>
<div>
<p>When ordering your Zencube, please specify which plug you require from US, Europe or UK.</p>
<b>Does Zencube work only with Zencube Essential Oils? </b>
</div>
<div>
<p>No, you can put anything in it as long as it smells good!</p>
<b>What is Zencube's cable length?</b>
</div>
<div>120cm<br/>
</div>
<div><b>How can I maximise the Zencube's health benefits? </b></div>
<div>
<p>Simple - leave it on at all times and let it work its magic!</p>
<b>Why did we choose a cube?</b>
</div>
<div>
<p>As Himalayan salt lamps are mostly hand-crafted with a traditional 
shape, a cube is the perfect proportion and ratio to be able to extract 
the maximum amount of benefits, and not suffer the same issues as 
traditional lamps. Not to mention it looks stunning! :)</p>
<b>How can we choose the colour or customise the product? </b>
</div>
<div>We'll be sending a survey out after the campaign where all details can be confirmed.<br/>
</div>
<div><b>Is the bulb replaceable? </b></div>
<div>YES. We have designed the LED modules to be able to be replaced.<br/>
</div>
<div><b>Why is international shipping so high?</b></div>
<div>Zencube is a pure salt block - hence it is extremely heavy at nearly 4kg
 (8.8lbs). We have just put one shipping cost to anywhere in the world 
and have actually subsidised this cost for some countries.<br/>
</div>
<div><b>How do I switch the lamp on and off?</b></div>
<div>The lamp has an on/off switch on there or you can use the App and do it directly from your smartphone.<br/>
</div>
<div><b>I want to send some Zencube's as gifts this Christmas. Will it be ready by then? </b></div>
<div>In a word.. Yes! We will be putting things into production in September and October and hope to deliver in November and December.<br/>
</div>
<div><b>Does the lamp still work with the LED bulb turned off?</b></div>
<div>The lamp only activates when it is turned on and the effects of the salt come from the heat from the bulb.<br/>
</div>
<div><b>Do the prices stated include shipping? </b></div>
<div>
<p>No, they don't. Shipping is added at checkout.</p>
<b>Will the lamp do well in humid environments?</b>
</div>
<div>Yes, the Zencube is fine in humid environments. We've tested it both in 
dry and humid environments. In humid environments, it may just sweat 
slightly more, but that's about it.<br/>
</div>
<div><b>What is the material on the casing on the salt cube?</b></div>
<div>
<p>The materials predominantly used are polycarbonate and butadiene.</p>
</div>

traditional salt lamps functionality with modern, contemporary design 
and the latest smart technology. Change the color to reflect your room 
or mood.  Melt your stresses away with Zencube's essential oil compartment. The soft ambient light, health benefits and the aroma of the oils will make you feel great.  The beauty of nature blends seamlessly with existing furniture and 
accessories, adding an element of peace and harmony to your décor.Here's why Zencube is awesome...



... and here's what it comes with. 

The salt crystal is exposed on both sides, encased in a wonderful robust shell.

Yes, the Zencube is fine in humid environments. We've tested it both in 
dry and humid environments. In humid environments, it may just sweat 
slightly more, but that's about it.

What is the material on the casing on the salt cube?

The materials predominantly used are polycarbonate and butadiene.",59.0,3,"2 Campaigns

Featuring 2 rounded triangle spin mops, Narwal prevails over traditional ones and easily captures fine dust and removes stains seamlessly.  
Mopping test: efficiently removed stubborn stains. 
The optimum spinning speed of the twin rotor and pressure make the cleaning virtually effortless. The ultra-fine microfiber mop pads ensure exceptional dirt removal and liquid absorption, yet gentle to the floor. 
 Narwal can be your reliable vacuuming buddy too. For daily cleaning of surface debris, Narwal works wonders helping you maintain floors clean just like other standalone robot vacuums. Powered by a 1800Pa motor, its immense suction pressure effortlessly takes care of all dust, dirt, pet hair and everything else in your home.

We believe everyone deserves a better home security experience that’s simple to use, durable enough to weather any situation, and reliably delivers high-performance monitoring, day and night. Meet the VAVA Home Cam — a wireless security camera designed to go outdoors or indoors, sets up in minutes, and has no monthly service fees, giving you more choice over how you control your footage. 
 
Here’s what you get: 
Know more of what’s happening A property crime happens every 3.7 seconds, and although more than 60% of us want home security, less than 20% of us actually do.  Why? Because the way home security has worked needs to change. Instead of complex systems requiring expert installation and ongoing monthly monitoring fees, we need simple, reliable home security that just works, outdoors AND indoors. VAVA Home Cam installs and sets up in minutes, and is designed to fit easily wherever you need an extra pair of eyes. 
 Stay Charged with the VAVA Solar PanelGet even more energy smart by pairing the VAVA Home Cam with a VAVA Solar Panel to harness the power of the sun so you’ll never need to recharge.  Each IP66 weather-resistant VAVA Solar Panel comes with its own mounting kit and 2M (6.5 ft) charging cable and weather-proof connectors. *Add the VAVA Solar Panel to any pledge for just $45*
See in 1080p high-def clarity with VAVA Home Cam's 140-degree wide angle lens, day and night. VAVA Home Cam's Sony EXMOR IMX323 sensor, wide dynamic range, and advanced H.265 encoding mean clear, sharp pictures in every environment  — even in complete darkness. The VAVA Home Cam goes beyond basic monitoring with a built-in alarm that you can trigger from your Home Cam app, and two-way audio communication so you’ll always stay connected.

Details to Help You See Clearer  
Not all 1080p resolution is created equal, and the VAVA Home Cam includes several details to help you see clearer.  Each Home Cam is equipped with an industry-leading Sony EXMOR IMX323 sensor, wide dynamic range, and uses H.265 video encoding for crisper images and footage. Wide dynamic range is designed to balance lighting in pictures and videos, and is especially helpful for situations where there is a contrast between lighting in the shade and elsewhere (e.g., front door entryways where it may be much brighter towards the street compared with directly in front of a door). Snapshot taken with no external light source H.265 video encoding allows for higher efficiency when transmitting video footage and takes up significantly less storage space. When compared with H.264 (which most cameras today use), H.265 cameras can generally reduce bandwidth consumption and storage by 50%, meaning a more seamless and space-saving monitoring experience for you.

Alerts When You Need ThemGet automatic alerts straight to your Home Cam app when unusual activity is detected, such as motion or when someone tries to move your camera. Each VAVA Home Cam comes with three levels of motion sensitivity (low, medium, and high) and a customizable monitoring schedule, so you'll only get the alerts that matter to you, when you want them.  For added protection, you'll also receive an alert when your Home Cam is moved out of range.See something unexpected? Trigger the VAVA Home Cam's built-in alarm directly from your app, no matter where you are in the world. Stay protected rain or shine, with VAVA Home Cam’s tough IP66 exterior to weather any situation. 
 
Each VAVA Home Cam comes with three different mount types (outdoor mount, strong magnetic mount, and desktop mount) for easy placement on any surface.   

Super strong magnetic mount 

Desktop mount 

Outdoor mount Outdoors or indoors — the choice is yours. The Home Cam’s unique design gives you the flexibility of protecting your home’s exterior or keeping an eye on what’s going on indoors. 
The VAVA Home Cam is as tough and versatile on the inside as it is on the outside — unlike most home security cameras that rely solely on one storage method, the VAVA Home Cam offers multiple options for locally encrypted storage that come at no extra charge to you. This includes support for storage on a microSD card (supports up to 128GB*), in addition to RTSP support so you can save footage on your personal NAS servers. Plus, the Home Cam will now also include optional cloud storage to give you even more peace of mind and control over how you control/access your footage. Extended Access to Your Footage. Free Forever.Both options give you safe, simple, secure access to your footage — without any extra fees. Because all footage is encrypted and stored locally through the base station, you’ll always have access through the VAVA Home Cam mobile app. At the end of the day, we believe your footage is yours, and you should always have the option for free, secure extended video history without any compulsory monthly fees.See how much you could potentially save with the VAVA Home Cam over just one year of ownership.The above is based on 30 day activity access for two cameras*128GB can store up to 240 hours worth of footage in 1080p HD quality  
We're here to make home security simpler and more accessible — without compromising performance. See how VAVA Home Cam stacks up. 
Always see what’s happening with the VAVA Home Cam mobile app, built for iOS and Android. We’ve included easy access to all the essentials you need, giving you one tap access to your live feed, alerts, snapshots, and two-way communication.  Other app features include:
Triggering an alarm 
Bookmarking recordings
Sharing camera access with up to 20 family members and trusted contacts
Scheduling alert notifications
Setting activity detection zones
Scheduled AlertsWith scheduled alerts, choose between 24/7 continuous monitoring or setting your own schedule. Schedules are set on a per Home Cam basis through the Home Cam app so you can customize alert schedules for each Home Cam you have (for example, set my Living Room Home Cam on monitor from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., set my Balcony Home Cam to monitor continuously, set my Back Door Home Cam to monitor between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.). Activity Detection Zones Have a specific area you want to cover? Define activity detection zones, so you’ll only receive the alerts and recordings you want. Resize zones depending on what you want to cover, and adjust sensitivity accordingly (low, medium, and high). Each VAVA Home Cam Base Station supports up to four Home Cams, so you'll leave no corner uncovered.  Outdoors or indoors, the Home Cam's flexible mounting system and tough, weather-proof exterior, and superior HD vision provides peace of mind and an extra pair of eyes wherever you need.  See Where You Can Put Your Home CamSave $140 off the estimated retail by backing the 4-pack of Home Cams today. Want to link up even more Home Cams? VAVA Home Cam makes it simple. Each Home Cam account supports up to 20 Base Stations or 80 Home Cams, so you can keep an eye out on your home, your business, your vacation home, and everything in between.

<h3>Our Story </h3>
<p>Some of the most memorable moments that I have with my parents and grandparents took place in the kitchen. Sharing and preparing food brings people together, and teaches children important life skills. Regardless of the demographic, people love delicious food, and creating something from scratch. Unfortunately, family time spent in the kitchen is on the decline, because they simply don’t have the time. People are spending less time in the kitchen, learning about reading labels, measurements, conversions, problem solving, and making connections.    </p>
<p>Two years ago I watched several viral videos demonstrating the making of rolled ice cream. Like millions of others, I was amazed by how simple and intriguing the process was. When reading the comments, I realized people from every age group, all over the world enjoyed the video. The video had so many views because people were sharing it with their family and friends. Immediately I looked up rolled ice cream stores, and found one to try it out. When I got there, there was a lineup of people. While waiting in line I watched customers before me, they all did the same thing. They ordered their ice cream, and then got their phone out to recorded it being made. They wanted to share their experience with friends and family on social media. When it was my turn to order, I did the same thing, placed my order, recorded the process, and then posted it on my social media.   </p>
<p>On my way home I ate the ice cream, it was absolutely delicious. When I got home, I checked my phone, and my friends and family loved the video. I realized that the sharing of the video was as satisfying as the ice cream itself, people were creating digital memories. I then thought, what if you could make it at home? A product like this could really get people back in the kitchen, and it would be a hit for dinner parties with friends and family. In a few minutes several people can make ice cream, share the video of it with the world, and create memories. And thus, the Ice Plate was born! The Ice Plate is a canvas for culinary creation, create recipes, create online content, share with the word. The prep time is short, but the memories last a lifetime.</p>

<p></p>
<p>An Affordable, Modern, Wireless Smart Lamp you can take anywhere! It is versatile, elegantly designed from the finest material, has 3 User settings, 18 brightness levels and can be shaped to fit your use, purpose and environment.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>You are
looking at Generation II Lumiére.</h4>
<p>While it looks similar to Generation I, a lot
has gone into this generation of Lumiére since we first introduced it in 2015 to make it a better performing, more versatile and durable light. We know you will love Lumiére and our backers will be the first to receive Lumiére shipping to all backers on or before April 8, 2016.</p>
<h4>Exterior
Refinements:</h4>
<p>Lumiére Gen
II will now come in 3 beautiful satin brushed aluminium finishes that so closely resemble
the iPhone colours. Lumiére Gen II will be available in Silver, Gold and Space
Grey for the light portion of Lumiére and a soft-touch silicone base available
in black or white that is now more flexible and durable so you can shape Lumiére
to suit your every need and environment.</p>
<p>You will
receive a survey shortly after the campaign is over to select the aluminium and
the base colours you want for your Lumiére.</p>
<h4>Internal Refinements:</h4>
<p>So much has changed on the inside. The PCB and firmware are the latest and include a 7-step
dimmer that remembers what settings you left your light on. The firmware that controls the On/Off button and step-dimmer has been refined so the light does not come on or off with an accidental touch and the dimmer operates with a single touch or the slide of a finger.
The PCB has also been equipped with a quick-charge chip to charge the new 2100
mAh 1000-cycle battery. Lumiére Gen II now has 28 of the best LED lights money can
buy and are guaranteed for 50,000 hours. See the gallery for some before and after images. You're going to love Lumiére and we cannot wait to get Lumiére into your hand and on to your desk and wherever else you want to take it.</p>

<p>Lighting has a dramatic affect on the mood and atmosphere of an interior space. Good lighting sets the tone and creates the atmosphere in a room and effects how we feel. The two biggest contributors to functionality from a lighting perspective are quantity and quality.</p>
<p>Too little and it becomes difficult to perform necessary tasks. Too much and it causes glare. Both scenarios can cause eye discomfort which lead to health issues, both physical and emotional. The Centre for Occupational Health and Safety describes good lighting as “providing enough illumination so that people can see printed, handwritten or displayed documents clearly but are not blinded by excessively high light levels, which causes glare”.</p>

That lets you illuminate your desk or nightstand for about 1/7th the energy you're probably using now. And the LEDs last more than 50,000 hours; it's likely you won't ever need to change them. </p>

</div></div>","Hello! Meet Lumière


An Affordable, Modern, Wireless Smart Lamp you can take anywhere! It is versatile, elegantly designed from the finest material, has 3 User settings, 18 brightness levels and can be shaped to fit your use, purpose and environment.


You are
looking at Generation II Lumiére.
While it looks similar to Generation I, a lot
has gone into this generation of Lumiére since we first introduced it in 2015 to make it a better performing, more versatile and durable light. We know you will love Lumiére and our backers will be the first to receive Lumiére shipping to all backers on or before April 8, 2016.
Exterior
Refinements:
Lumiére Gen
II will now come in 3 beautiful satin brushed aluminium finishes that so closely resemble
the iPhone colours. Lumiére Gen II will be available in Silver, Gold and Space
Grey for the light portion of Lumiére and a soft-touch silicone base available
in black or white that is now more flexible and durable so you can shape Lumiére
to suit your every need and environment.
You will
receive a survey shortly after the campaign is over to select the aluminium and
the base colours you want for your Lumiére.
Internal Refinements:
So much has changed on the inside. The PCB and firmware are the latest and include a 7-step
dimmer that remembers what settings you left your light on. The firmware that controls the On/Off button and step-dimmer has been refined so the light does not come on or off with an accidental touch and the dimmer operates with a single touch or the slide of a finger.
The PCB has also been equipped with a quick-charge chip to charge the new 2100
mAh 1000-cycle battery. Lumiére Gen II now has 28 of the best LED lights money can
buy and are guaranteed for 50,000 hours. See the gallery for some before and after images. You're going to love Lumiére and we cannot wait to get Lumiére into your hand and on to your desk and wherever else you want to take it.


A wireless lamp for just about everywhere
Our hope is that our design and the technology behind Lumière will make even the most mundane tasks a bit more fun. Lumiére embodies technological and safety features that protects your eyes and we think its modern clean-line design will look great in your space.

""A Portable Lamp like no other, with one charge you can take Lumiére anywhere. To your garden, to the park or even to the beach and set the mood with 40 Hours of continuous lighting.""


   
Just How Flexible? You Decide!

Light up or down, flat or not. Even as a Lightsaber!

Mood light
Lumière brightness can be changed from 10% to 100% in three different temperatures suitable for studying, reading and relaxation.
 
Lighting has a dramatic affect on the mood and atmosphere of an interior space. Good lighting sets the tone and creates the atmosphere in a room and effects how we feel. The two biggest contributors to functionality from a lighting perspective are quantity and quality.
Too little and it becomes difficult to perform necessary tasks. Too much and it causes glare. Both scenarios can cause eye discomfort which lead to health issues, both physical and emotional. The Centre for Occupational Health and Safety describes good lighting as “providing enough illumination so that people can see printed, handwritten or displayed documents clearly but are not blinded by excessively high light levels, which causes glare”.

Torch Mode
Access the full power of Lumière with just a touch by extending the 56CM body and take it with you to light any dark places.
   



Lumière creates a wonderfully unique light that prevents glare and creates an even light pattern. Using light guide technology, it eliminates shadows or dark zones, which ordinary LED table stands create.
Smart and flawless design
The beauty and quality of Lumière does not only come from the inside. We equally spent thought and care on the outside. We wanted to design a lamp with a flush design, without external buttons. The touch and multi-level dimming sensors work easily and literally to give Lumiére the finishing touch and because it is smart, it remembers your selected light mode, brightness and settings!

The Perfect Accent Light to Set the Right Mood!
Lumiére also has adjustable settings for brightness, but whether it's turned on or off, Lumière makes a great visual impact perfect for your home, office, study or even your garden!

Different scenarios require different types of lighting. With Lumiére, you have complete flexibility to adjust your lighting to any variation of both Cool White, Neutral White and Warm White lights, at any brightness, any time and shape Lumière to suite your specific use and function for that added personal control.A simple, modern, no-frills design, Lumière is available in 3 colours with multi-touch controls that let you turn on/off/dim by touching after you've finished your New York Times bestseller.




Silver, Space Grey and Gold with White or Black Base
The price tag is as easy on the wallet as the lamp is on the eyes, and can be shaped into whatever need you might have while enjoying your read.
With the wireless and 28 high quality powered daylight LEDs, you can take Lumière anywhere. Indoors or outdoors; you determine the atmosphere.

Lumiére is a task and accent lamp that can give you as much light as a 60-Watt incandescent light bulb. That lets you illuminate your desk or nightstand for about 1/7th the energy you're probably using now. And the LEDs last more than 50,000 hours; it's likely you won't ever need to change them. 


Lumière is a high-quality, versatile product at a fair price that includes innovative features not seen anywhere else.

Of the 3 operating modes, Study Mode is the brightest, using mostly white LEDs for a colour temperature of between 5,000K and 6,000K. Reading Mode 4,000K to 5,000K mixes in more of the yellow spectrum, Relaxation, Computer, Tablet, Smartphone, Bedtime; Nightlight Mode brings the colour temperature down to 3000K to 4000K. All Modes have a 6-step dimmer to suit every possible task.
The Colour Rendering Index of the LEDs is rated at 90+. With up to 40 hours of lighting time you can take the lamp to your garden, to the park or even to the beach.


Access the full power of Lumière with just a touch by extending the 56CM body and take it with you to light any dark places.Never be concerned about disturbing your sleeping partner ever again.Mood light Lumière brightness can be changed from 10% to 100% in three different temperatures suitable for studying, reading and relaxation.It's flexible, and versatile so it fits your exact needs.










The Bright Road Ahead


We've put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into Lumière... well figuratively, and we are so close to turning our dream into a bright reality. It takes a lot to manufacture a quality product, and while we are close, we need your help to get us over the last hump. 
The tooling is already done and this leaves the cost of components, and manufacturing costs ahead, but also we need your help to build a community around Lumiére and spread the word before and after you experience Lumiére.
We manufactured several thousand units last year as part of the Hong Kong Show then assigned a distributor in the UK, China and Germany markets. Since then, we have refined and improved Lumière on 8 critical features and produced some samples.

The Aluminium colours of the new production match the iPhone. What we have today is an amazing task lamp that looks and performs flawlessly, that you can truely take anywhere!
We are so far ahead in this process and with your help and support we will Ship Lumière to all our backers in March 2016.

Night Lights - don’t let your kids be afraid of the dark any longer. Geode will provide their room with a soft glow to keep those monsters away.
Special Events - capture the attention of passersby with one or many Geodes displaying pictures, graphics or a message. You can even use several Geodes to tell a story.
Birthdays and Anniversaries - what better way to make them appreciate your thoughtfulness by providing them with a customized Geode that uses an image the receiver holds dear to their heart.
Art Projects - Geodes would be perfect for art projects of all sorts.

Thanks for your help IndieGoGo!  Feel free to like Ghost Nest on Facebook and share this IndieGoGo project with your friends!

Is it bright? Hell yes!   Geode is bright enough to fill a room, read a book next to, or use as a night-light.  Our current prototypes show 210 lux at 12”.  You won’t be able to project a bat symbol into the sky, but rest assured, all monsters in the closets, alligators under the bed and boogeymen won’t be bothering you anytime soon. We use 15 5500 LEDs.  It’s bright, but not blinding.  Best yet, it only uses 2W of power yet it has the light output of a 15-watt conventional light bulb.What is included with every Geode? Every Geode comes with power cord, Geode body (contains LED lights and rechargeable battery) and white picture holder frame (what you need to put your photos into Geode).  Everything will be pre-assembled for your convenience.  Is shipping included? No shipping is not included in these pledge levels.  We are going to be using USPS flat rate for delivery, so costs will be low, around $15 in the US.  The shipping for Geode to Canada/US is going to be $32.95 and all other countries it'll be $47.95.  However for all larger orders, we will use other methods.   
Can I get colored frames and cords for Geode?The good news is that all frames and cords for Geode will be interchangeable.  Bad news is that the first run of Geode will be done in all white.  You'll just have to hold tight for now.",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I am 20 years old. For me it has been 20 years of fighting against weaknesses, numerous moments, when there was no answer to the question: Why did it happen to me? It caused lack of will to live, moments of breakdown. I envied others their ability to perform very simple actions, such as getting up, going for a walk... And me? I was born without hands and legs. The disability deprived me of all those things my peers did. All my life I have fought with my physicality – here my parents have always been my support, my hands and legs.<br/><br/>When I understood that rebelling or wallowing in self-pity would change nothing in my life, I decided to fight for my life, for my future. Learning was my resort and liberation: I passed my A-levels with honours. I decided to go to university and study IT. I think I can be really good at it and after finishing the university I can find employment in the chosen profession and pay, if only symbolically, my debt of gratitude to those who helped me, show them that I also want and am able to give something to the world.<br/> My dream is to become financially independent Take the burden off my parents shoulders. I believe that IT can give me a huge opportunity with my future career and I could be able to become an independent man, with the need for constant medical care.</p>
<p>Despite my disability I try to live the life of a healthy person. I develop my passions (civil aviation, passenger airplane piloting) and interests (music, IT, programming, history, politics and law). I am determined to achieve my goals (getting a job, becoming independent). But at this stage of my life I need your help. I cannot make it without yours.</p>
<p>I will always rely on other people in my life. The decision to go to university is a major life change for my whole family. Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology was the only institution which offered me appropriate learning conditions, a room, and a course tailored to my individual needs. The institute is helping me by relieving me of the tuition fee ($3,500), but I still have to pay for other things. Renting a flat and the necessity to move in with my parents put me in need of large amounts of money ($3,000 monthly) for maintaining the flat, commuting to the university, and for treatment. Lack of limbs is not the only problem and barrier in my life that affects normal functioning. For a few years now my scoliosis has been getting worse. It puts pressure on my internal organs, e.g. lungs, which causes dyspnoea and respiratory tract infections. I also suffer from asthma. These conditions require constant treatment and the cost of medicine, physiotherapy and rehabilitation stays is far beyond the financial capabilities of my and my family. I suffer from asthma and advanced scoliosis, which presses my lungs causing additional dyspnoea. The pharmaceuticals I need are expensive ($12,000 yearly), and I take a part of them on a regular basis.</p>
<p>There is hope to improve the condition of my spine, but it requires me to go to Spain for a few weeks – the treatment which I can receive there gives me a chance to live since the developing scoliosis is simply a death sentence. The only obstacle here is the money ($15,000).<br/><br/>Many good things has happened in my life thanks to people’s kindness, due to the fact that somebody donated even a small amount for my treatment, rehabilitation, and the necessary equipment – at present I am trying to raise money for an electric wheelchair ($25,000), which would give me some self-reliance. However, the ever-present cost of treatment makes such a wheelchair an unrealistic dream.<br/><br/>Every help is a wonderful gift, thanks to which I can live and study.

At Kitsune Cutlery, we wanted to make a knife to solve this problem. Our mission was to source the best steel, have the best craftsmanship all while being extremely affordable.We wanted to make a knife that any master chef or home cook alike would be proud to use, so we created Kitsune Cutlery. About the Knife Steel: In our pursuit for the best quality material, we stumbled upon Japanese VG-10 Damascus steel. This steel, notorious for its hardness and ability to retain its edge is world renowned among knife makers. The steel is so prized in fact that it is made only by a single forge in the Fukui prefecture in Japan, the legendary Takefu Steel Company.                                                             Takefu Steel Company, Japan                                                                                                                             Kitsune Chef Knife at Work Due to the exclusivity and quality of VG-10 Steel, there has inevitably been knock off and reproductions of real Japanese Takefu VG-10 Steel. Thousands of knives endorsing fake VG-10 Steel circulate the market to this day. Here at Kitsune Cutlery, we have taken the utmost precaution and care to ensure that this does not happen to our consumers. We have partnered with a manufacturer known to carry real Takefu VG-10 Steel imported from Japan with the credentials to prove it.

But managing time your kids spend in gaming, entertainment, and social media one device at a time is not merely inconvenient. It’s impossible. If a child runs out of time on one device, they can just hop onto a different device - often continuing the same activity, like watching YouTube videos. <br/>With Sofia Family, when a child reaches a time limit for an activity on any device, that activity is blocked on all devices. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Is there a limit to the number of devices I can manage with Sofia Family?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> Your monthly subscription includes as many hubs, computers, and mobile devices as you care to manage. There is no limit on the number of family members, either. Each hub manages up to 5 devices in one media center: the TV, along with up to four devices connected to the TV (such as game consoles, media streamers, disc players, Cable / Sat TV boxes). </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>The Sofia Family hub manages up to 5 devices in one media center. What do you mean by a ‘media center’? </strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> By ‘media center’, we don’t mean a piece of furniture. We mean a TV in your home, together with all of the video and gaming devices connected to the TV with HDMI cables. These can include game consoles (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo), media streamers (Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV, Nvidia Shield TV, etc…), Cable / Sat TV boxes, disc players, and Home Theater PC). </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>I have two media centers in my house. Do I need to buy a second hub?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> You will need one Sofia Family hub for each media center in your home that you want to manage. If the devices you want to manage are all in one media center, you could just use one hub, and leave the devices in your other media center unmanaged. An additional hub costs $59.99 (MSRP), and is easy to add at any time. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Can’t my kid just unplug the HDMI cables from the Sofia Family hub to circumvent the system?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> The Sofia Family hub electronically detects when HDMI cables are disconnected from the hub or from the devices it manages (Xbox, TV, etc…). When an HDMI cable is disconnected, Sofia Family sends a push notification to the parent(s). The hub also detects when an HDMI cable is reconnected, so the parent(s) can see in the device log how long the cable was disconnected. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>My router comes with parental controls included. How is Sofia Family different?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> The nice thing about router-based parental controls is that they are compatible with all device types, and can provide helpful content filtering. However, router-based systems cannot monitor or limit the amount of time a child games or watches videos or television offline. They cannot tell which family member is using a shared device (like Apple TV, a game console, or family computer). And children can easily bypass router-based systems by connecting to another available wireless network. <br/> <br/><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Why is it important to manage offline activity? </strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> Some parental control solutions focus on managing ‘online time’. But even with restricted ‘online time’, your child can still game an unlimited number of hours per week offline. Your child can still watch an unlimited amount of cable TV. Your child can still use their ‘online time’ to download dozens of hours of Netflix videos to watch at a later time offline. Because kids extensively game and watch videos both online and offline, an effective time management solution has to be able to monitor and limit activity both online and offline as well.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Is Sofia Family difficult to install and set up?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> No. It takes less than 5 minutes to install the Sofia Family app on each of your mobile devices and computers. The Sofia Family hub is installed by connecting the HDMI cables of the devices in your media center to the hub. It takes about 15 minutes to set up. Setup wizards guide you every step of the way, and we provide easy-to-follow installation videos and live support.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Does my child need their own smartphone to access a device managed by the Sofia Family hub?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> No. A parent can grant access to any family member through the app on the parent’s mobile device. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Will my subscription price be higher if we have a big family?  </strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> No, the price to subscribe to Sofia Family is the same regardless of the number of family members, or the number of devices you choose to manage.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Does the Sofia Family hub need to be in view to work?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> No, you can install the hub in a location where it cannot be seen. However, there is an LED on the front of the hub that indicates when the hub is operating normally, when a port is active, and when an HDMI cable has been disconnected. All of this information is available in the Sofia Family app, but you may find the LED helpful. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Does the Sofia Family hub generate heat.</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> No, the Sofia Family hub generates very little heat. However, you should not locate the hub directly on top of other devices in your media center that do generate heat.</p><h3> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Have friends or relatives in your social networks that would be interested in managing screen time in their homes? <br/>Please share the good news!</strong></h3><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599633992/h579qt7gebst5cm5brad.jpg"" src=""""/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A//igg.me/at/sofia-family"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click to share with your Facebook network</a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599634020/kv3pvybwnzqex5ff2sxx.jpg"" src=""""/><a href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=TODO%20https%3A//igg.me/at/sofia-family%0A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click to share with your Twitter network</a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Thank You Very Much!</strong></p></div>","Sofia FamilyDigital Activity Manager

Each hub manages up to 5 devices in one media center: the TV, along with up to four devices connected to the TV (such as game consoles, media streamers, disc players, Cable / Sat TV boxes). Q: The Sofia Family hub manages up to 5 devices in one media center. What do you mean by a ‘media center’? A: By ‘media center’, we don’t mean a piece of furniture. We mean a TV in your home, together with all of the video and gaming devices connected to the TV with HDMI cables. These can include game consoles (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo), media streamers (Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV, Nvidia Shield TV, etc…), Cable / Sat TV boxes, disc players, and Home Theater PC). Q: I have two media centers in my house. Do I need to buy a second hub?A: You will need one Sofia Family hub for each media center in your home that you want to manage. If the devices you want to manage are all in one media center, you could just use one hub, and leave the devices in your other media center unmanaged. An additional hub costs $59.99 (MSRP), and is easy to add at any time. Q: Can’t my kid just unplug the HDMI cables from the Sofia Family hub to circumvent the system?A: The Sofia Family hub electronically detects when HDMI cables are disconnected from the hub or from the devices it manages (Xbox, TV, etc…). When an HDMI cable is disconnected, Sofia Family sends a push notification to the parent(s). The hub also detects when an HDMI cable is reconnected, so the parent(s) can see in the device log how long the cable was disconnected. Q: My router comes with parental controls included. How is Sofia Family different?A: The nice thing about router-based parental controls is that they are compatible with all device types, and can provide helpful content filtering. However, router-based systems cannot monitor or limit the amount of time a child games or watches videos or television offline. They cannot tell which family member is using a shared device (like Apple TV, a game console, or family computer). And children can easily bypass router-based systems by connecting to another available wireless network.  Q: Why is it important to manage offline activity? A: Some parental control solutions focus on managing ‘online time’. But even with restricted ‘online time’, your child can still game an unlimited number of hours per week offline. Your child can still watch an unlimited amount of cable TV. Your child can still use their ‘online time’ to download dozens of hours of Netflix videos to watch at a later time offline. Because kids extensively game and watch videos both online and offline, an effective time management solution has to be able to monitor and limit activity both online and offline as well.Q: Is Sofia Family difficult to install and set up?A: No. It takes less than 5 minutes to install the Sofia Family app on each of your mobile devices and computers. The Sofia Family hub is installed by connecting the HDMI cables of the devices in your media center to the hub. It takes about 15 minutes to set up. Setup wizards guide you every step of the way, and we provide easy-to-follow installation videos and live support.Q: Does my child need their own smartphone to access a device managed by the Sofia Family hub?A: No. A parent can grant access to any family member through the app on the parent’s mobile device. Q: Will my subscription price be higher if we have a big family?  A: No, the price to subscribe to Sofia Family is the same regardless of the number of family members, or the number of devices you choose to manage.Q: Does the Sofia Family hub need to be in view to work?A: No, you can install the hub in a location where it cannot be seen. However, there is an LED on the front of the hub that indicates when the hub is operating normally, when a port is active, and when an HDMI cable has been disconnected. All of this information is available in the Sofia Family app, but you may find the LED helpful. Q: Does the Sofia Family hub generate heat.A: No, the Sofia Family hub generates very little heat. However, you should not locate the hub directly on top of other devices in your media center that do generate heat. Have friends or relatives in your social networks that would be interested in managing screen time in their homes? Please share the good news!        Click to share with your Facebook network Click to share with your Twitter network Thank You Very Much!",20.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Story and how the ""Smart Bowl"" got here</h3>
<p>Thank you for checking out my campaign. My name is Kong Namvong and I am a proud and long time dog owner. Being a dog owner has brought a lot of joy to my family’s life.  My dog's name is Spikey and he is a part of my family.  He is like one of my children and like my children, I want Spikey to have anything and everything in his life that will make him happy.  And when it comes to Spikey's happiness, his food is very important to his survival.</p>
<p>For many years of having Spikey, one of the main frustrations when it comes to feeding him, is the constant battle against house ants invading his food.  This is a major nuisance, especially during the warm summer months when ants are most active looking for food. Every time I would leave Spikey’s food out,the food bowl would be covered with ants in no time! Even when the bowl is left inside the house, these ants are so determined that eventually they would find their way inside our home and invade our dog’s food. Those were the most frustrating times for myself, my family and Spikey because Spikey would not touch his food when he found ants all over it.  He would even go the entire day without a nibble.  At the end of the day I would have to discard all of his food and give him a fresh bowl.  This became too exhausting and wasteful over the years.</p>
<p>After years of putting up with these ants, I began to do some research on ants and how to keep them from my dog's food. Interestingly, I found that ants play an important role in our ecosystem and do a lot of good things for us human. They control the populations of pests like fleas, spiders, bed bugs, flies, silverfish and clothes moths.Eradicating ants from my property is not what I want to do. I just don’t want them to invade my house and my dog’s food.</p>
<p>One of the non-toxic and eco-friendly ideas that I stumbled upon to keep ants out of my dog’s food was to surround the food bowl with water. By placing the food bowl in a larger bowl or a pan filled with water, the water barrier acts as a moat and keeps the ants out. We all know ants are not good swimmers and will not cross this water barrier. I liked this idea because no toxic chemicals were used to keep ants away and most importantly did not contaminate Spikey's food in the process. For days I started feeding my dog using this technique and saw that it kept the ants away. However, this technique was not as effective as it could be. It was easy for the food bowl to be shifted to one side of the water bowl; or if I added less water, the water bowl would dry out in no time and give ants access to crawl right over both walls of the bowls.  It was an improvement but was not user friendly nor convenient enough for me to feed Spikey on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Keeping this “water barrier” idea in mind, I started to do some designing. After numerous pages of pencil sketches and about a year later, I finally came up with a one piece ant-proof pet food and water dish combo and calledit ""Smart Bowl"".  Smart Bowl's prototype was made in December of 2011 and I started to feed my dog using this bowl. An improvement to use an added insert bowl came to my mind recently after thinking about a dog and cat or small dogs living in same house but having to eat two different types of food. Because this insert bowl can be divided into two food compartments, it makes it ideal to hold two different types of food for your small pet(s).</p>
<p>So far only a prototype was made and is field tested every day by my dog Spikey and as expected, it does keep ants out of the food compartment!  I just have to make sure to replace the water compartment with fresh drinking water daily and Spikey’s food bowl would stay ant free. I no longer have to worry about my dog being fed when I’m not home. This product works and I want to share it with each and every pet owner who are experiencing the same ant problem and frustrations.</p>
