My Grandpa Notty taught me how to make the perfect meatball, and for years I have had a dream of starting my own meatball food truck. However, I wanted to dip my toe in the restaurant business first to make sure that I really could balance my job of being a kindergarten teacher with making hundreds of quality meatballs at a time. That's when I started my pop-up, StickBall, in which I popped up in different kitchens around the city selling my meatballs. Originally my theme was to have meatballs on sticks, like a kebab (hence the name StickBall). Sadly, my meatballs are just made with a little too much love and were too tender to stay on the sticks. I ended up sticking with the name but dropping the sticks. </p><div>
After a very successful year of doing different pop-ups and catering events, I decided that I wanted to take the next step to making my dreams come true and work toward getting a food truck. As many of you know, teachers don't quite make the big bucks, so my IGG campaign is to help me raise the start-up costs for my food truck and its set up. The average food truck start-up is anywhere from $50,000 - $100,000, but we have found one for $5,000. The extra money we are asking for will pay for the cost to drive the truck from New Jersey to New Orleans, repainting the truck, and initial set-up fees. Thanks for taking the time to read my story and look forward to serving you delicious meatballs from my food truck one day! <p></p>
</div><p></p><h2>Risks and challenges</h2><p>As with anything that is starting from the ground up, I know there will be challenges along the way. One thing I am sure will cause some bumps in the road are permits. When it comes to vending food permits, it can get a little tricky, but we've done our research and feel very prepared for what's ahead. If for some reason food trucks become illegal or we are unable to get our food truck license, we plan to use all the money to launch and maintain our pop-up for the upcoming years. We would be able to buy better equipment and really step up our company.</p><br/></div>","My Story I was raised in an Italian kitchen and haven't been able to drop my wooden spoon.

overcome them. CCC uses chess as a therapeutic model and an instrument for encouraging academic achievement, community engagement, and the utilization of critical thinking skills.  </p>
<h3>Classic City Knights</h3>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to take the <i>Classic City Knights, </i> CCC's resident chess team and mentor group, to compete in the annual Bum Rush the Board chess
tournament in Washington, D.C. (<a href=""http://www.wblinc.org/brb-tournament/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.wblinc.org/brb-tournament/</a>).
Many of the students have never journeyed outside of their towns or the state
of Georgia. This annual trip to Washington, D.C. will be a life-changing, eye
opening, and educational experience for them.  Not only will they compete
in the chess tournament, but they will also get an opportunity to tour the
Nation’s Capital and Howard University. Many will learn that the world is bigger
than their neighborhoods, and will get the opportunity to meet
other youth from around the country to share in solutions for
empowerment. </p>
<p>On December 5-8, 2014, we will take
12 middle and high school students from Athens, Georgia, to Washington, D.C.
for an annual chess tournament and touring of the Nation’s Capital.  The
students will be chaperoned by three adolescent development mentors. We are
seeking $5,000 to contribute to the following:</p>
<p>•<span>  </span><b>Round-trip transportation rental for students and chaperones
 </b></p>
<p>•<span>  </span><b>Fuel costs (approximately 1,250 miles) and insurance</b></p>

<p>In the event that we are unable to reach our maximum

we are able to raise.  We have already begun local campaigning in hopes of
covering expenses not mentioned.    </p>
<h2><b>The Impact</b></h2>
<p>We are extremely proud of our

them.  Despite the hands they were dealt, many of them maintain a
positive outlook and attitude on life.  For some, chess has become the
model for planning their lives, and for others, playing chess helps them escape
the various cycles they are attempting to break. They continue to stay focused on their personal goals by engaging in community projects and events like this annual trip to Washington, D.C. </p>

(Youth Empowerment Synergy) San Diego is an initiative created to connect LGBTQ youth, their allies and their parents to resources to build the best possible future. Founded by Hector Martinez and Ian Morton, the goal of this program is to break down the barriers between these individuals and their personal, professional and spiritual goals.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The 2014 Y.E.S. Conference:</h3> <p>Our signature event is a free, one-day conference for all of San Diego's LGBTQ youth to attend at San diego State University (SDSU). During this conference, we introduce young people to LGBTQ political, business and community leaders and offer a series of workshops geared toward finding success in their goals. We address cultural, professional, religious and collegiate environments as well as personal growth and healthy behaviors. </p>
<p>The cost of the conference is $8,000, which covers the the space needed to hold approximately 250 attendees, as well as food &amp; drinks for the day. While about 75% of our funding is procured through businesses and foundations, we also rely on community support to keep this conference free for youth and parents alike!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Our Impact:</h3> <p>Even in 2014, LGBTQ youth are more likely to engage in self-harming behavior, are at higher risk for suicide and HIV/STD infections, experience higher rates of homelessness and often fall out of scholastic pursuits. Y.E.S. San Diego creates access to safety net services, scholarship opportunities, internships and other tools to engage these youth in reaching their maximum potential as healthy and fulfilled adults!</p>

</div></div>","Who we are... Y.E.S. (Youth Empowerment Synergy) San Diego is an initiative created to connect LGBTQ youth, their allies and their parents to resources to build the best possible future. Founded by Hector Martinez and Ian Morton, the goal of this program is to break down the barriers between these individuals and their personal, professional and spiritual goals.   The 2014 Y.E.S. Conference: Our signature event is a free, one-day conference for all of San Diego's LGBTQ youth to attend at San diego State University (SDSU). During this conference, we introduce young people to LGBTQ political, business and community leaders and offer a series of workshops geared toward finding success in their goals. We address cultural, professional, religious and collegiate environments as well as personal growth and healthy behaviors. 
The cost of the conference is $8,000, which covers the the space needed to hold approximately 250 attendees, as well as food & drinks for the day. While about 75% of our funding is procured through businesses and foundations, we also rely on community support to keep this conference free for youth and parents alike!
  Our Impact: Even in 2014, LGBTQ youth are more likely to engage in self-harming behavior, are at higher risk for suicide and HIV/STD infections, experience higher rates of homelessness and often fall out of scholastic pursuits. Y.E.S. San Diego creates access to safety net services, scholarship opportunities, internships and other tools to engage these youth in reaching their maximum potential as healthy and fulfilled adults!

<h3>We have met our goal! I'm going to Haiti!</h3>
<h3>I just wanted to post an extra special thank you to EVERYONE that has contributed, both online and in person. You are an inspiration to ME as I am about to travel away from my sweet little family for the first time ever. I will take thoughts of you with me to Haiti and shower your love on the people I meet there.</h3>
<p>Though I am saddened that my daughter will not be able to join us, I know that God will make a way for her to experience such a trip one day too.</p>
<h3>***********************</h3>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I was 5 or 6 years old, sitting in the auditorium of our <span style=""font-size: small;"">little</span> school listening to them talk. A couple and their children were missionaries visiting our school to tell us their stories about the work that God was doing through them. They showed us photo after photo of hungry mothers with their babies, children in ragged clothing. <strong>My heart was clenched.</strong> In that moment I decided <strong>that</strong> would be <strong>me</strong> someday -- <strong>an international missionary</strong>. As I grew older though, I lost that vision. I got caught up in the distractions of life and moved on to other worthy goals. College. Graduate school. Marriage. Motherhood.</p>
<p> But now, the time has come!</p>
<p>My name is Tori Prophet, follower of Christ, wife, and mother. I am asking for your help sending me <strong>to Cap Haitien, Haiti from April 22-28, 2012</strong>. With YOUR generosity, I will have the opportunity to travel to Haiti with my church, <a href=""http://www.churchproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""""><span style=""color: #cc0000;"">Church Project</span></a>, and make that childhood dream come true. More importantly though, this is a chance to <strong>make a real and lasting impact</strong> in the lives of Haiti's vulnerable children. I am so excited about the chance to experience this culture and reach out to these sweet, sweet people.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Embrace.</strong></p>
<p>Partnering with<a href=""http://www.newlifehaiti.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""""> <span style=""color: #cc0000;"">New Life Haiti</span></a>, our mission is to minister to the people of Cap Haitien both physically and spiritually. <strong>We will be the hands and feet of Christ,</strong> embracing the people and working to feed, clothe, build new schools and churches, fix broken water pipes, begin health initiatives, develop Vacation Bible Schools where children will have fun learning about the God who loves them, and support the educational efforts of those within the community who are trying to give back to their people.</p>
<p> <strong>Equip.</strong></p>
<p>By helping with the construction of schools and churches, we will give the people of Cap Haitien what they need to <strong>continue reaching out to their own communities.</strong> One well-constructed building becomes the center of life for a village. It becomes the place to get your basic needs met, the place to worship, the place where children learn, the place of safety from storms. A garden well-tended becomes their nutrition, their commerce, and their livelihood. We are also sending clothing and supplies to use for our projects. While we are there, other needs will surely present themselves and we will do all we can in response.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Empower.</strong></p>
<p>We are traveling to a part of Haiti where help has been needed for so long, but has never been received. This mission trip will not only provide answers to immediate needs, it will empower the people of Cap Haitien to be able to meet their own needs long after our week is over. This is not a field trip, nor is it a vacation. <strong>This is a mission to pour ourselves into the lives of others</strong> to help them grow and thrive. And this is only the first of several trips. We will continue to travel to this village, bringing our help and resources for as long as God wills it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not only do I want to make an impact in the life of this village, I also want my children to learn from my example and be inspired. I want my children to cultivate a passion for being the hands and feet of Christ and for spreading God's love to all nations.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal I've set for this fundraiser is just to cover my travel. <strong>It is our bold prayer that you would give generously and sacrificially so that my 13 year old daughter can also travel with me and our church.</strong> It has long been my vision for each of my children to go on a mission trip and learn first hand the responsibility we have by being so blessed. Can you imagine the impact of such an experience on her entire life? Alexandra is a sweet girl with a heart for Christ, basketball, and filmmaking. She is as excited to visit Haiti as I am and plans to take her video camera with her to capture her journey.</p>
<p> <strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">The cost for each person is $1300</span></strong> which covers the cost of airfare, lodging, transportation, and meals. So,<strong> </strong>we would need<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> $2600 for both of us</span> to be able to go. This amount does not cover personal expenses such as passport, clothing, supplies, or gifts. We are holding a series of bake and craft sales to raise those additional funds. If I do not meet my goal, I will continue to fundraise, and the money raised here will be saved and used to send a member of my family on the 2nd trip to Haiti later this year.<strong> If we only raise enough for me to travel to Haiti, we will count it a tremendous blessing! </strong>Throughout this process, I will make updates to let you know how our efforts are progressing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ALL DONORS</strong> will enjoy a Thank You e-card from us along with a link to a slideshow of the photos we will take while on our trip.

new camera body - Nikon D300-Nikon D800 (depending on how much I can raise here & save on my own)



new memory cards




updating my website


I'm not a big fan of asking for money, but by donating to my campaign you will also be able to get something in return! You will be able to pick any photograph off of my Facebook Fan Page & receive the print of your choice to keep by clicking one of the perks to the right.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to make my dreams come true. Whether it be spreading the word or donating a few dollars, it means the world to me.

<p>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</p>
<p><span>changeclothing is an apparel company, and so much more. Our passion is creating positive change worldwide... starting with T-shirts as the foundation for this mission, and you as the “warrior of change.” Why T-shirts? Why you? Because we know that the real YOU is strongly reflected in the CLOTHES you wear. So by creating distinctive T-shirts that tell the world you support a deserving charitable organization, we can continue perpetuating significant positive change.</span><br/><br/><span>Right now, we're creating a network of forward-thinking artists and working with them to create art for the weekly campaign t-shirts.</span><br/><br/><em>What's a campaign? </em></p>
<p><span>We work hard to serve four distinct categories of need: Animal, Human, Earth and Outreach. Once a week, we partner with a charity in one category for a campaign, define a need for the charity, then design a shirt specifically for their charitable cause. The shirt then goes on sale for one week only. When you buy and wear one of these high quality, artistic T-shirts, a generous proceed of your purchase price will go to support that week's charitable cause. Change has never been easier! (Depending on the product sold and quantities sold, donations can run 20%, up to 40% of purchase prices)</span><br/><br/><em>So what’s the money for you may ask?</em><br/><br/><span>We're raising money to launch the site and for our first five campaigns.

<h3>What Is The Outlet?</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are a collection of core volunteers who value the Tallahassee community, working to respond to a perceived lack of affordable mental health care.</li>
<li>We want to provide a variety of services including group and peer counseling, arts-based activities, a library of mental health literature for self-empowerment, and referrals to professional counseling. We hope to make mental health care more accessible for all.</li>
<li>Ultimately, we would like to financially assist individuals seeking professional counseling who can't afford it.</li>
<li>
<strong>YOU</strong> will help us obtain a space to have confidential peer to peer counseling, informative workshops, referral services, and house materials for arts based activities.</li>
<li>The Outlet will also function as a safe space. A safe space is a positive, supportive, and accepting environment.  A safe space actively cultivates and maintains an atmosphere free from homophobia, racism, ableism, body negativity, sexism, classism, transphobia, oppressive behavior, and general hatefullness. </li>
<li>This will be a place to learn and grow as a community; a place to have your neighbors help you out and help them when they need it.</li>
<li>We will hold daily office hours for individuals to be able to stop in and use the library, chat, play some music, make some art, or just rest their feet and drink some tea. Additionally, we will hold monthly group peer to peer counseling sessions related to specific topics picked by the community (eg. anxiety, relationship issues, depression, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>More Specifically, What We Need Is...</h3>
<ul>
<li>$3600 for rent and utilities at The Oasis Center for one year!</li>
<li>$3000 for office supplies, including a computer!</li>
<li>$2500 for merchandise, including t-shirts, CDs, and a community projector for film screenings and presentations!</li>
<li>$2000 for music and art supplies to work on alternative approaches to mental health!</li>
<li>$1000 for food and drinks at our various community events!</li>
<li>$500 for furniture so our office can be comfortable to those looking for someone to talk to!</li>
<li>$400 for supplies necessary to print and distribute zines to empower our community!</li>
<li>$400 for liability insurance!</li>
<li>$100 for gas to use when we go on sober outing trips!</li>
</ul>
<p>*All of this totals out to $13,500 BUT IndieGoGo takes a certain percentage of the money raised depending on whether or not we meet our goal. This is why the goal amount has been rounded up to $15,000!*</p>
<h3>Why Are We Doing This?</h3>
<p>According to Statehealthfacts.org, in 2010, Florida ranked 49th in the country for mental health funding with only $39.55 per capita. According to the CHSP Needs Assessment and Process Evaluation Final Report conducted in March 2010, in Leon County, ""Availability of mental health services was viewed as a serious problem by mental health advocates. The number of adults receiving mental health treatment decreased from 4,544 in 2004-2005 to 2,714 in 2008-2009.</p>
<p>Tallahassee is a vibrant city with rich diversity. We want to pool our collective life experiences and use them as a resource to empower one another via mental health improvement. There is so much to learn and so much to teach, we want to help make that happen.</p>

<p>We are a brand new, husband and wife, start-up company called <a href=""http://soulanceco.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soulance</a>.  A personal care and wellness product company, <a href=""http://soulanceco.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soulance</a>, is all about bringing your body and soul into a state of balance - hence the name - <a href=""http://soulanceco.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soulance</a>... balancing your soul.  </p>
<h2><strong>What do we do?</strong></h2>
<p>We have spent the last year developing, formulating and tweaking a line of three different and very specific Aromatherapy Oils which can be used in a relaxing bath or applied directly to your skin.  By using specifically formulated blends of essential oils and aromatherapy, we have created bath &amp; body oils aimed at treating three typical areas in which most people seem to experience common imbalance: <em>Muscle Recuperation</em>, <em>Cold &amp; Sinus Relief </em>&amp; a <em>Stress Release/Night Time Relaxer.</em></p>
<h2><strong>What is our philosophy? </strong></h2>
<p>Our philosophy, as a company, is that you can use our products to combat the negative impact of the outside ""noise"" created by our environment, by helping you to take a moment for yourself, hit your internal reset button and engage your five senses.  We believe that by engaging your senses in a positive manner, they have the power to help you find your OWN unique equilibrium.</p>
<h2><strong>So, why do we need your help?  </strong></h2>

<h3>Help Christine take part in society!</h3>
<p>Hello!<br/>My name is Christine Bylund, I work as a  performance-artist, club organizer and disability rights activist, amongst other things. I also study Gender Studies at Stockholm University. I am physically dis/abled and use a taxi-service provided by the Stockholm County because I can not ride the subway.<br/>Due to an increased workload (something that is just fun as a freelancer) and study tempo, I found out on the 6.th of May that I had used the 119 one-way trips assigned to me by the County Council.

On average, three one-way trips per week!</p>
<p>I then applied for  additional travels during the period May 7 to June 30 in order to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Participate in the planning and execution of work</li>
<li>Use social functions such as banks and libraries</li>
<li>And take part in cultural and leisure activities</li>
</ol><p>On the 14th of May the County rejected my application on the grounds that these trips could not be regarded as essential. Something that is very puzzling. I will of course appeal the decision but in the meantime, I need your help.</p>
<p>Right now I have to use regular taxis to take me to work, studies and leisure activities, coffee with friends, shopping and so on.

På förekommen anledning känner jag att behöver specificera detta: Färdtjänst är inte en gratis tjänst! Jag betalar 790kr/mån, lika mycket som ett SL-kort hos kollektivtrafiken, trots att jag betalat detta får jag inga fler resor.

Hej!Jag heter Christine Bylund, arbetar som scenkonstnär, klubbarrangör och funktionshinderaktivist bland annat. Jag studerar också genusvetenskap vid Stockholms Universitet.

</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Depending on the amount you contribute you can get all kinds of stuff, from SouperVan pins, to social media shout-outs to being the recognized sponsor of the day. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many communities around the Tri-state area have been devastated by Hurricane Sandy.

That becomes harder to believe when you spend hours and hours swiping followed by days and weeks in dead-end chats.

Basically what they realized was was that...</p><h3>Other dating a<span>pps = a lot of effort for little in return</span>

<p>Hotdot's fundamental design makes it more difficult to create and maintain fraudulent accounts</p>
<ul><li>Or you simply <b>invest too much time </b>on an app to meet a person that ends up clearly not being a good match </li></ul>
<p>Hotdot gets you off the couch swiping and messaging and out in the real world meeting people in real situations so you can know right away if there is real chemistry.</p>

<h3>The Hotdot Map</h3>
<p>Every Hotdotter's map is different and is based on the profiles they have indicated they are interested in. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.hotdotapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Dots-Gif.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</li>
</ol>

<h2><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Find the hotspots that are right for you...</span></h2>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<p>A neighborhood with a cluster of yellow dots means that could be a hotspot for your type. You could head there and see who you meet (they might only be yellow because they haven't seen your profile yet!)</p>
<p>A neighborhood with a cluster of orange dots means that is a hotspot for your type AND when you get there those orange dots will be Hotdots and you can connect and see where it goes. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Hotdot enhances your night out</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>You are going to to go out anyway. With Hotdot you aren't limited to just meeting the people in the same establishment. You can now connect with people in the place next door, across the street or around the corner. With these mutual matches the ice is already broken, the introduction is made. <b>Instead of sitting on an app and endlessly chatting, ask your match to meet up and grab a drink, a bite of food or just say hi. </b></p>
<p>Hotdot is all about taking the advantages of the meeting people online and using them to enhance your night out. We want users to get face-to-face faster because no one is a better judge of if you are a match than you are.</p>

<h2>New York City &amp; Hotdot...a love story. </h2>
<div><br/></div>
<div>While the app will be available across the US for download, at launch we will be focusing our efforts on getting the word out and building a community in New York City. We need to do this in order to make sure we hit a critical mass of users that will create a great experience for everyone in the city. That said, <b>Beta Testers and other contributors to development can be located anywhere.</b>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Once we have a strong community established in New York we will begin promoting Hotdot in other markets across the country. Which cities we go to next will depend on where there is opportunity and where YOU want us. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Despite our plans of promoting Hotdot in various cities to build communities there is nothing keeping communities of users from sprouting up organically.  That's where you can help by spreading the word and helping to build communities in your city. </div>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why we need your backing</h3>
<p><b>Reason One:</b></p>
<p>Your contributions will go to two things. <b>Development</b> and <b>Marketing</b>.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We need some help to get our vision developed at a quality that you'll love for both iOS and Android. </span></p>
<p>Contributions will also help us promote Hotdot and create a strong user base so everyone can have a great user experience. </p>
<p><b>Reason Two:</b></p>
<p>Even more important than the actual pledges, <b>we want to find people who are as excited as we are about Hotdot to be Beta Testers</b>. We want to learn from you and use that to make Hotdot even better.</p>
<p>If you can't back us but you still want to help then tell your friends and followers about us. Let your single friends know about a great app that is coming. Every bit helps and every bit brings us closer to bringing our dream to the reality of so many people. </p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<div>
<p></p>
<div>
<h3>How will other users be able to see where I am?</h3>
<p>When your map is turned on your general location will be represented by an anonymous dot to only those who have indicated they like you. There is a certain margin of error that will be programmed into your dot so that the general area is represented and not your exact location. No user can see your dot and your profile at the same time. This means there is no way for a user to know which dot represents what person. They only know that they like that person.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<h3>How do I use the map?</h3>
<p>You use the map as you would Google Maps or other map apps. The main difference is it will be populated with anonymous dots representing users you have indicated you like. When you are zoomed out and looking at a large area you can look for areas that have a lot of people that you like (or a lot of mutual matches). Plan on going there! You’ll be more likely to meet someone that is your type. Once you’re in the area you can zoom in and connect with any mutual matches in the area and see where it goes.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<h3>When can I connect with matches?</h3>
<p>You can only connect with mutual matches who are also within the same general area (a few hundred feet). Hotdot is all about complementing your everyday life in the real-world and not spending hours on your couch hoping to get a connection or a date.</p>

<p>We take your security very seriously. No user can tell what dot belongs to what person. You can never see someone’s profile AND dot at the same time. Maps of new users will not be populated until a sufficient number of profiles are liked making it impossible to tell which is which.

That becomes harder to believe when you spend hours and hours swiping followed by days and weeks in dead-end chats. Hotdot grew out of these frustrations that everyone seems to be having but no one is fixing. Co-founders, Miro and Eric, actually met after investing a lot of time on another app only to find that they weren't a good match. Basically what they realized was was that...Other dating apps = a lot of effort for little in return
Like any other technology there are always areas for improvement and common hangups experienced by the users. We decided to focus on some of the top ones to find a better way. With many of the current apps out there problems arise when...Users must ""game"" the apps in order to generate any valueGaming Hotdot only reduces its usefulnessCreatively gaming other apps
Bots or phishing becomes prevalent
Hotdot's fundamental design makes it more difficult to create and maintain fraudulent accounts
Or you simply invest too much time on an app to meet a person that ends up clearly not being a good match 
Hotdot gets you off the couch swiping and messaging and out in the real world meeting people in real situations so you can know right away if there is real chemistry.

Source: imgur.com
With Hotdot we eliminate these common problems by truly bridging the gap between online dating and meeting people in the real world. We take all the great things these technologies provide us and blend them seamlessly with what it means to be human and meet face-to-face. 

Using Hotdot

Just by having fun and using Hotdot's sorting interface, a user creates a custom real-time map that consists of anonymous dots representing other users that they are interested in.



This map will guide users to areas of the city where their ""type"" is going out. Hotdotters will discover new places to go and can see when to go there based on what their map shows them. 

The Hotdot Map
Every Hotdotter's map is different and is based on the profiles they have indicated they are interested in. 

Someone you like is a yellow dot
Someone who likes you too is an orange dot
When a mutual match is nearby they become a Hotdot and its time to connect



Find the hotspots that are right for you...

A neighborhood with a cluster of yellow dots means that could be a hotspot for your type. You could head there and see who you meet (they might only be yellow because they haven't seen your profile yet!)
A neighborhood with a cluster of orange dots means that is a hotspot for your type AND when you get there those orange dots will be Hotdots and you can connect and see where it goes. 

Hotdot enhances your night out

You are going to to go out anyway. With Hotdot you aren't limited to just meeting the people in the same establishment. You can now connect with people in the place next door, across the street or around the corner. With these mutual matches the ice is already broken, the introduction is made. Instead of sitting on an app and endlessly chatting, ask your match to meet up and grab a drink, a bite of food or just say hi. 
Hotdot is all about taking the advantages of the meeting people online and using them to enhance your night out. We want users to get face-to-face faster because no one is a better judge of if you are a match than you are.

New York City & Hotdot...a love story. 

While the app will be available across the US for download, at launch we will be focusing our efforts on getting the word out and building a community in New York City. We need to do this in order to make sure we hit a critical mass of users that will create a great experience for everyone in the city. That said, Beta Testers and other contributors to development can be located anywhere.


Once we have a strong community established in New York we will begin promoting Hotdot in other markets across the country. Which cities we go to next will depend on where there is opportunity and where YOU want us. 

Despite our plans of promoting Hotdot in various cities to build communities there is nothing keeping communities of users from sprouting up organically.  That's where you can help by spreading the word and helping to build communities in your city. 


Why we need your backing
Reason One:
Your contributions will go to two things. Development and Marketing.
We need some help to get our vision developed at a quality that you'll love for both iOS and Android. 
Contributions will also help us promote Hotdot and create a strong user base so everyone can have a great user experience. 
Reason Two:
Even more important than the actual pledges, we want to find people who are as excited as we are about Hotdot to be Beta Testers. We want to learn from you and use that to make Hotdot even better.
If you can't back us but you still want to help then tell your friends and followers about us. Let your single friends know about a great app that is coming. Every bit helps and every bit brings us closer to bringing our dream to the reality of so many people.

FAQs



How will other users be able to see where I am?
When your map is turned on your general location will be represented by an anonymous dot to only those who have indicated they like you. There is a certain margin of error that will be programmed into your dot so that the general area is represented and not your exact location. No user can see your dot and your profile at the same time. This means there is no way for a user to know which dot represents what person. They only know that they like that person.




How do I use the map?
You use the map as you would Google Maps or other map apps. The main difference is it will be populated with anonymous dots representing users you have indicated you like. When you are zoomed out and looking at a large area you can look for areas that have a lot of people that you like (or a lot of mutual matches). Plan on going there! You’ll be more likely to meet someone that is your type. Once you’re in the area you can zoom in and connect with any mutual matches in the area and see where it goes.




When can I connect with matches?
You can only connect with mutual matches who are also within the same general area (a few hundred feet). Hotdot is all about complementing your everyday life in the real-world and not spending hours on your couch hoping to get a connection or a date.




What do you mean by “anonymous dots”?
We take your security very seriously. No user can tell what dot belongs to what person. You can never see someone’s profile AND dot at the same time. Maps of new users will not be populated until a sufficient number of profiles are liked making it impossible to tell which is which. When users connect they can see each other’s profile again and their dot immediately disappears off of the others map.




When I connect with a match, what happens to their dot
As soon as you connect with someone the dot representing their general location disappears off of your map. Your dot also disappears off of their map. Users cannot see your profile and your dot at the same time.

<div>My name is Steve Young and for the last 2 years of the 15 we have been in business my internet marketing company has primarily helped businesses build their reputation online. There are 100's of local directory sites with their own system of star ratings and rules. What I have noticed is that it is not easy and many of the directories make it very difficult and sometimes downright impossible for a business to build their reputation because the sites choose which reviews they show also known as ""filtering reviews"".</div>

</div>
<div>That's right, the reviews left on the review site are technically their property and they can show whichever reviews they want.

<br/>Yelp has been manipulating reviews and now other review sites are starting to do the same.. where does it end? People are fed up with the unethical practices of Yelp, and  there are already people standing against Yelp to expose these injustices. A new documentary called ""Billion Dollar Bully"", set to come out in 2016, brings to light many of the unethical practices that Yelp practices on small business owners.</p>

Why start with the Rainforests?


We are already in the 6th mass extinction of planet Earth according to scientists at Stanford, and it's getting hotter and hotter by the day. The bottom line is we need Earth's lungs to cool us down, keep our air clean, and purify and make our drinking  water. According to livescience: 




About half of the world's tropical forests have been cleared (FAO) in the last 35 years. Earth has gotten progressively hotter throughout this time.
Rainforests help keep the world's weather in check- they regulate both  temperature and weather patterns.
Rainforests are one of the world's primary carbon sinks, which reduce toxic levels of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
A fifth of our fresh water is found in tropical rainforests, the Amazon basin to be exact.
Rainforests help to maintain our supply of drinking water and fresh water, (via rain all over the world) and are critical in Earth's sustainability.
Forests currently cover about 30 percent of the world’s land mass (National Geographic)
Forest loss can contribute as much greenhouse gas emissions (12-25%) as all the world's trains planes and automobiles.(13%) 
About 36 football fields worth of trees are lost every minute. (World Wildlife Fund (WWF))

1 in 4 ingredients in our medicines are found in Rainforests.

Within 4 square miles  of tropical rainforest, you will find 1500 flowering plant species, 750 types of trees,  many of these plants being crucial to combatting cancer.
Over 70% or more of the plants that are used to combat cancer are found only in the tropical rainforests of the planet.
Less than 1% of the species of plants in the tropical rainforests have actually been analyzed to determine there value in the world of medicine.
Scientists believe that there are millions of plant, insect and animal species in the rainforests that have yet to discovered.
Rainforests are threatened every day, especially by agriculture, ranching, logging and mining.
The majority of the oxygen supply that we have throughout the world is supplied by the tropical rainforests , even though they are miles and miles away.

<p><span>This is a crucial year to mobilize: The climate talks in Paris in December (COP21) is a big moment for us all to seize. We want to create a platform for Sámi, an indigenous people living in Sápmi (Northern Norway, Sweden, Finland &amp; Russia), to mobilize for the climate and against injustice. </span></p> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">And to do this, we need your help!</span></p>

<p><span>We will provide Sámi activists, organizers, campaigners and artists with a space to gather in Jokkmokk on August 28-30.

<p><span>“If climate change continues at this rate, we won't have any reindeer left because reindeer won´t survive and adapt. And it goes too fast, they won't be able to adapt. I have been working with reindeer only 14 years now, but this  last ten years we haven't had a normal winter. Last ten years, the climate and temperature change from day to day and that makes snow compact and sometimes with ice layers and if the snow is too compact, the reindeer can´t smell food. If they doesn´t find food it is very simple, and then it starv to death. If this climate change keeps going on at this rate, I´m pretty sure that the reindeer won´t survive it, it goes too fast right now. And without the reindeer, the Sámi culture will also disappear and world will be a indigenous people poorer.” Niila Inga, Reindeer herder, Kiruna, Sweden. </span></p>

This is a crucial year to mobilize: The climate talks in Paris in December (COP21) is a big moment for us all to seize. We want to create a platform for Sámi, an indigenous people living in Sápmi (Northern Norway, Sweden, Finland & Russia), to mobilize for the climate and against injustice.  And to do this, we need your help!

We will provide Sámi activists, organizers, campaigners and artists with a space to gather in Jokkmokk on August 28-30. A space to share skills, build relationships and develop collective plans for challenging injustice. This weekend will strengthen our community and help build mobilisation plans ahead of the climate talks in Paris. Do you think this plan should be made a reality?
Make this weekend possible by chipping into our Sápmi mobilization crowdfund.


WHO WE ARE
 
We are Jenni Laiti & Max Mackhé, two grassroots organisers in Sápmi. Jenni lives in Jokkmokk, Sweden, and is full-time artivist, Max lives in Skånland, Norway, and is a culture worker and artist.
We already have support from the climate justice organisation 350.org, the artivist group Suohpanterror and the film festival Sápmi Indigenous Film & Arts Festival Dellie Maa but now we need your help too to make this weekend the best possible.
We see the need to mobilise Sámi grassroots on environmental issues and for COP21 in Paris!




WHERE THE MONEY WILL GO
This weekend, some of the most successful activists in this region of the Arctic will travel to Jokkmokk. We want people to meet and learn from each other - experienced and beginners, young and old, from all across Sápmi (which stretches across the north of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia)
The money from this crowdfund will mean that participants' and activists' travel costs can be paid for - ensuring that this weekend is accessible to all our allies.

   HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS IMPACTING OUR PEOPLE  
“If climate change continues at this rate, we won't have any reindeer left because reindeer won´t survive and adapt. And it goes too fast, they won't be able to adapt. I have been working with reindeer only 14 years now, but this  last ten years we haven't had a normal winter. Last ten years, the climate and temperature change from day to day and that makes snow compact and sometimes with ice layers and if the snow is too compact, the reindeer can´t smell food. If they doesn´t find food it is very simple, and then it starv to death. If this climate change keeps going on at this rate, I´m pretty sure that the reindeer won´t survive it, it goes too fast right now. And without the reindeer, the Sámi culture will also disappear and world will be a indigenous people poorer.” Niila Inga, Reindeer herder, Kiruna, Sweden. 
Niila is also planning to attend our skillshare weekend.

mission of HOMEY is to transform the lives of high-risk youth (ages 13 to 24)
by improving their educational outcomes and ability to be self-sufficient. We inspire youth to strive toward physical, mental and emotional health through the youth development practices of relationship and skill
building and community engagement activities. For over a decade, HOMEY has been a
recognized leader within the youth leadership development field. THE NEED WE ADDRESS:  Did you know,
that despite San Francisco’s central role in the technology industry, Latino
and African-American youth continue to do poorly in our city?
In 2012, 44% of Latino and 66% of African American youth dropped out of high
school. At HOMEY, we believe that high dropout rates are also correlated to
youth incarceration and homicides. A recent report stated that of all homicide
victims in San Francisco, 38% were youth and young adults
between the ages of 14 to 25, and of those victims 94% were high school
dropouts. HOW YOU CAN HELP: We have received a challenge grant up to $12,000! The matching funds we raise will go directly to our Part Time Youth Group Facilitator and help with program costs. More about our programs...Through dedicated and creative leadership, HOMEY has developed a safe place for street-identified and high risk Latino youth to find respite, guidance, encouragement and alternatives so they can pursue their potential academically, creatively and socially.  Using an in-depth cultural framework, HOMEY provides youth with innovative strategies to build motivation, knowledge and insight. Community involvement is emphasized to build compassion, networking and civic engagement.  HOMEY turns lives around! Check out the HOMEY Video.


80% of HOMEY’s high-risk participants show
an improvement in school attendance and letter grades.


3500+ hours of service with youth annually


92% of participants reported enhanced enjoyment and
engagement in learning as a result of the program


90% success rate in participant’s increase in self
esteem


300% increase in program participation since 2011


6 San Francisco high schools on waiting list for HOMEY programming

In an independent evaluation, participants scored HOMEY
a 4.5 out of 5 in support, engagement, interaction, intentional skill building,
and increased linkages with school day.

<p>This secures the core of the project (steps 1 and 3). I'll start working on the DEP this week-end.</p>
<p>There's a stretch goal at €6000 for improving the architecture of Django templates (step 2). Let's see if we can reach it! :-)</p>
<h3>The project</h3>
<p>The <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/templates/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Django Template Language</a> has a long history of receiving criticism for its design and its performance. During the last few years, the idea of replacing it with <a href=""http://jinja.pocoo.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jinja2</a> has come up regularly.</p>
<p>While the two languages have superficially similar syntax, they're quite different. Forcing a transition upon the entire Django ecosystem isn't realistic.</p>
<p>I'm proposing to solve this problem in Django 1.8 by:</p>
<ul>
<li>supporting some alternate template engines such as Jinja2 out of the box</li>
<li>keeping the Django Template Language as the default template engine</li>
<li>defining a stable API for integrating third-party template engines</li>
<li>supporting multiple template engines within the same Django project</li>
</ul><p>This will provide a standardized way to use Jinja2 templates in Django projects and to ship Jinja2 templates with pluggable apps.</p>
<p>Furthermore this will pave the path to template-based form rendering.</p>
<p>I'm planning to split the project in three parts. Steps 1 and 3 are the core of the project. Step 2 isn't strictly required but it would allow for a more consistent implementation of step 3.</p>
<p>Each step should require about forty hours of work if everything goes well — which isn't the most likely outcome, but I'm prepared to take the time this project will require :-)</p>
<h4>Step 1: write a Django Enhancement Proposal (DEP)</h4>
<p>I'll start by researching the subject and designing the implementation. I've already performed preliminary analysis and sketched APIs in order to validate my ideas before starting this campaign. But I still have many decisions to make, details to check, and blanks to fill.</p>
<p>The output of this step will be a DEP that:</p>
<ul>
<li>expands the rationale summarized above</li>
<li>arguments design decisions</li>
<li>outlines an implementation plan</li>
<li>provides guidelines for third-party template engines</li>
<li>answers frequently asked questions</li>
<li>analyzes the features of Django templates</li>
<li>surveys other Python template engines</li>
</ul><p>I will discuss and improve the DEP until consensus is reached.</p>
<h4>Step 2: refactor Django templates as a library (stretch goal)</h4>
<p>Unlike other Python template engines, Django templates are configured with global settings. That makes them hard to test or use as a library outside a Django project. This issue is discussed in <a href=""https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/17093"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ticket #17093</a> and in <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/django-developers/WT1cOvpPbSM/lYRtJ9G0Av4J"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a mailing-list thread</a>. Unfortunately, Christopher Medrela's patch wasn't merged and it doesn't apply any more.</p>
<p>My project is a good opportunity to complete this refactoring. It will bring Django templates up to par with other engines, make future maintenance easier, and is expected to provide a more robust base for implementing the DEP.</p>
<p><i>I will tackle this step if the campaign raises at least <i>€</i>6000.</i></p>
<h4>Step 3: implement the DEP</h4>
<p>You know the drill: code, tests, docs ;-)</p>
<p>That's nothing fancy but good software takes time, especially under strong backward-compatibility requirements.<br/></p>
<h4>Communication</h4>
<p>Throughout the project, I will post weekly or fortnightly updates on the <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-developers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">django-developers</a> mailing-list and on the project's website. In each message, I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>describe what I've been doing</li>
<li>explain what problems I encountered, if any, and what solutions I chose</li>
<li>announce what I'm planning to do next</li>
<li>talk about open questions and ask for feedback</li>
</ul><h3>About me</h3>
<p>I've been a Django core developer since 2011.</p>
<p>With more than 50 commits touching `django.template` or `django.templatetags`, I know Django's template engine very well.</p>
<p>I have contributed several large features to Django:</p>
<ul>
<li>timezone-aware handling of datetimes (1.4)</li>
<li>support for Python 3 (1.5) with the help of other committers</li>
<li>overhaul of transaction management (1.6)</li>
<li>app-loading refactor (1.7)</li>
</ul><p>I haven't started working on a feature for Django 1.8 yet. If this campaign succeeds, it will be Jinja2!</p>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>An interesting question — after all I've been doing a lot of work for free during the last four years.</p>
<p>For each of the features listed above, I had a strong motivation. I worked on timezones to prove I could join the core team. I worked on Python 3 because I couldn't stand Python 2 any more. I worked on transactions and app-loading because my professional projects had hit Django's limitations in these areas.</p>
<p>Django templates are a different case. I'm happy with them for simple projects. They work quite well considering how they're designed and implemented. If I need something else, I know what my options are.</p>
<p>I'd like to improve Django in this area because I'm hearing demand from the community. However I'm not ready to dedicate so much of my free time without compensation for my family. Your gifts will allow me to give this project the attention it deserves and motivate me to produce the very best work I can manage.</p>
<p>If the campaign raises more than €8000 (which both the <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/andrewgodwin/schema-migrations-for-django"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Migrations</a> and <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mjtamlyn/improved-postgresql-support-in-django"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PostgreSQL</a> campaigns did) I will give back 20% of the proceeds above this limit to the Django Software Foundation and 5% to the Ada Initiative.</p>
<p><i>This campaign is my own. It isn't an official Django one. However, both the Django Software Foundation and the Django core team have given their approval. </i></p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>Even the most carefully planned software project carries some risks. Unexpected edge cases can appear. Seemingly good design can be hard to implement cleanly.</p>
<p>However, considering my past experience with projects of similar size, I'm confident that I can resolve or sidestep such issues. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I started working on transactions, I didn't realize that my plan would add savepoints around every ORM operation, throwing off `assertNumQueries` in tests. After a long debate, I solved the problem by adding a keyword argument to the `atomic` context manager.</li>
<li>Near the end of my implementation of time zone support, I discovered two problems in the admin, one with date hierarchies, the other and datetime widgets. Since I wasn't able to fix them, I documented them as known limitations in Django 1.4. Eventually they were fixed in Django 1.6.</li>
</ul><p>There's also a small risk that the Django core team or technical board will object to my design or my implementation. However, I have already obtained positive feedback on the general design from several core developers and most members of the technical board. I have also committed more backwards-incompatible and more complicated changes to Django before.</p>

There's a stretch goal at €6000 for improving the architecture of Django templates (step 2). Let's see if we can reach it! :-)
The project
The Django Template Language has a long history of receiving criticism for its design and its performance. During the last few years, the idea of replacing it with Jinja2 has come up regularly.
While the two languages have superficially similar syntax, they're quite different. Forcing a transition upon the entire Django ecosystem isn't realistic.
I'm proposing to solve this problem in Django 1.8 by:

supporting some alternate template engines such as Jinja2 out of the box
keeping the Django Template Language as the default template engine
defining a stable API for integrating third-party template engines
supporting multiple template engines within the same Django project
This will provide a standardized way to use Jinja2 templates in Django projects and to ship Jinja2 templates with pluggable apps.
Furthermore this will pave the path to template-based form rendering.
I'm planning to split the project in three parts. Steps 1 and 3 are the core of the project. Step 2 isn't strictly required but it would allow for a more consistent implementation of step 3.
Each step should require about forty hours of work if everything goes well — which isn't the most likely outcome, but I'm prepared to take the time this project will require :-)
Step 1: write a Django Enhancement Proposal (DEP)
I'll start by researching the subject and designing the implementation. I've already performed preliminary analysis and sketched APIs in order to validate my ideas before starting this campaign. But I still have many decisions to make, details to check, and blanks to fill.
The output of this step will be a DEP that:

expands the rationale summarized above
arguments design decisions
outlines an implementation plan
provides guidelines for third-party template engines
answers frequently asked questions
analyzes the features of Django templates
surveys other Python template engines
I will discuss and improve the DEP until consensus is reached.
Step 2: refactor Django templates as a library (stretch goal)
Unlike other Python template engines, Django templates are configured with global settings. That makes them hard to test or use as a library outside a Django project. This issue is discussed in ticket #17093 and in a mailing-list thread. Unfortunately, Christopher Medrela's patch wasn't merged and it doesn't apply any more.

</div></div>","Our Story

MomsWithMS.com
was created after realizing the need. Women, diagnosed with multiple
sclerosis 3-2x as often as men, typically get diagnosed with multiple
sclerosis between ages 20-40 (more
info).
This is also the “fertile years” of a woman's life when we are
either having babies, trying to have babies or actively trying NOT to
have babies. This raises questions about if they want babies, and
even more about the prescriptions and if it is ok to take them while
pregnant/nursing etc. Up until this site was created there was not
place for moms to discuss sensitive issues typically not discussed in
mixed company to share their experiences and get support from each
other. Since
the launch over 700 moms diagnosed with multiple sclerosis have
joined the site from all over the world. We
have been mentioned 2 times in national publications and also 2 times
in local publications (Press
page here).
Since
launch I have been getting testimonials like the following on a
regular basis:


""Having
MS was confusing and frustrating.  When I was rushed to the
hospital for the second time, after my myriad of questions, my doctor
said, ""This is the weirdest disease.""  Therefore, the
fact that Kristin created Moms with MS is astounding.  Having
children to me is the most important adventure I have undertaken.  To
have something such as MS hold me back is disheartening.  However,
to be able to go to a site where others are confronted with the same
obstacles is a blessing and I have Kristin to thank for it.


Sincerely
and Wholeheartedly,


A.C.""
(mom with ms)

Soon
after launching the site I found that not just moms but the husbands,
kids, siblings and parents of some of the moms were attempting to
join the site. To maintain the privacy of members, these kind hearted
people were turned away. At one point a 'sister' site that was called
something like ""She has MS"" to let these people connect but
it was not as successful, I dropped that project and focused on
supporting the site for moms.Eventually
the solution to this issue was found, an affiliated public site
with a blog of stories and news written by moms with MS, fundraiser
information, press, links to resources, and more was created
MomsWithMS.org. We are also
a national team for the NMSS
Walk
and Bike events, raising in excess of $20,000 in our first year
(2010) and almost $25,000 this
year,
and so having a site to refer donors to became even more
important.So
here we are now, and we have a thriving online community at
MomsWithMS.com
with
over 700 moms, connected in this journey of raising our kids while
dealing with this unpredictable diagnosis. This part of this whole
effort is almost completely hidden from public view. We
also have the public site, which most of the moms aren't really a
part of that talks about achievements and how great the site and
community are but isn't actually connected to THE community that
started it all. What
we need is to integrate the two sites into one. This
campaign is to make this possible. 



The Impact YOU Will Make!!




Moms
	with MS looking for connection and anyone looking to understand or
	support them can come to the same site for information.  


No
		more moms signing up at the public site thinking it's private or
		family members applying to the private site and getting a rejection
		for not being a mom with MS, one single place to sign on that gets
		them whatever access and information appropriate to them.




More
	easily accessible posting methods to contribute to the public part
	of the site.


No
		more requiring moms who want to contribute to learn/remember
		multiple posting methods or logins to share a story publicly vs
		privately.




More
	time to spend promoting the site and spreading awareness so that
	other moms with ms who are going through these challenges alone can
	find the site and get support.


Less
		time rejecting non-moms and explaining that it is just for moms but
		they can go to this other site, and less time confusing moms who
		are looking for this thriving community but end up just signing up
		to be able to post comments or get information. 




More
	time to be able to look into the benefits of becoming at some point
	more than a site, but an actual non-profit or mission based
	B-corporation that provides more than community for members.



Improved
	SEO


The
		two sites will no longer be competing when someone does a search
		for ""moms with ms"" and the high rankings will go even
		higher. 






Kristin
	(I) will be able to finish up with writing a retrospective covering
	the why and how of creating and promoting the community in the first
	place to educate people who find a similar niche in need of
	representation have the information they need to make it happen
	(will be available in both digital and paper formats).



Once
	CiviCRM releases the wordpress version of their application better
	communication with members, donors, readers, and more will be
	possible.





What
You Get

In
addition to the perks listed on the side you will also get the
satisfaction of knowing that you improved the lives of hundreds,
hopefully soon thousands of people who are looking for the peer
support they need in their journey of life as a mom with multiple
sclerosis.

</h3> <p>My name is Peter Emerson, the child of an Irish Protestant father and English Catholic mother.  I have lived in Belfast since 1975.</p>
<p>The Northern Ireland problem was exacerbated by majority rule.  Similarly, to quote <i>Oslobodjenje</i>, Sarajevo's famous newspaper, ""all the wars in the former Yugoslavia started with a referendum.""   And again, in the Caucasus and now Ukraine, problems were/are rarely solved by two-option votes.</p>
<ul></ul>
<p>Scotland, thank God, is at peace.  It would therefore be an ideal scenario to show how multi-option preference voting could work.  I demonstrated this procedure at a public meeting in Edinburgh in 1997; I wrote about it in the journal <i>Scottish Affairs</i>; and I made numerous representations to both the UK and Scottish parliaments, alas, to no avail.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
 My name is Peter Emerson, the child of an Irish Protestant father and English Catholic mother.  I have lived in Belfast since 1975.
The Northern Ireland problem was exacerbated by majority rule.  Similarly, to quote Oslobodjenje, Sarajevo's famous newspaper, ""all the wars in the former Yugoslavia started with a referendum.""   And again, in the Caucasus and now Ukraine, problems were/are rarely solved by two-option votes.

Scotland, thank God, is at peace.  It would therefore be an ideal scenario to show how multi-option preference voting could work.  I demonstrated this procedure at a public meeting in Edinburgh in 1997; I wrote about it in the journal Scottish Affairs; and I made numerous representations to both the UK and Scottish parliaments, alas, to no avail.
Hence the need, now, for a multi-option survey, based on six options, five of which are distilled from the policies of the main Scottish political parties, and one is the status quo.   What We Need & What You Get The cost of the survey, scheduled to be undertaken by a professional company, TNS - http://www.tnsglobal.com/uk - is £5,360.  The data will be analysed both by them and by the de Borda Institute - www.deborda.org

  The Impact In 1991, at a cross-community conference in Belfast where we used multi-option voting, one of the guests was a native of Sarajevo.  Thus we warned of the dangers of holding a two-option referendum in Bosnia, where there was no majority anyway: 40% were Bosniaks, 30% Bosnian Serbs and 20% Bosnian Croats.  Alas, our warning went unheeded and, six months later, the two-option ballot was held.  It started the war.
Earlier, in 1985 in Belfast, when hundreds of thousands were saying ""No"" to the Belfast Agreement, six of us stood outside Belfast City Hall with a slogan: ""we have got to say 'yes' to something."" 
In the light of so many instances in which the two-option vote has been inadequate - another incident relates to South Sudan - it is so important to demonstrate how multi-option preference voting might help people, in many countries, to come to an agreement. 

  Risks & Challenges In a modern plural democracy, many problems should not be reduced to just two options.  This is obviously the case in Scotland, where the debate started with three options: (A) independence, (B) devo-max (maximum devolution) and (C) status quo.  It was then decided to have just a two-option vote: A v C, independence yes-or no?  
The debate has moved on.  The 'no' option, C, no longer represents the status quo, but an unspecified form of B; and some argue, the same can be said of the 'yes' option.  This is just one defect of reducing a complex question to a dichotomy.  Sadly, however, no-one is talking about preference voting.
As a result of campaigning on this topic over the last 40 years, in a largely unpaid capacity, I have nevertheless gained the necessary understanding of voting procedures in particular, and decision-making in general.  Furthermore, I have been published in a number of works on the subject.  Hopefully, then, the findings of a multi-option survey, to be issued in press releases and fuller reports, will be covered by the media… and, as a result, multi-option preference voting will be adopted by politicians of all parties, and not only in Scotland.

<div><b>STORY</b></div>
<div>I believe that people who are suffering from cancer or the stress of a 
loved one having cancer is one of the hardest experiences to go through 
in a lifetime.  I know that because I watched my father suffer and die 
from pancreatic cancer within less than a years time.  What I was 
missing during that experience was support and not just counseling.  I 
needed something to remind me that I wasn't alone.  I needed to be 
reminded that the rest of the world was still spinning and experiencing 
things even though my world had come to a dead stop.  I ran out of time 
but there are still millions of people suffering from this emotional 
burden everyday.  That is why I believe Patchwork truly has a home on 
the web for people to communicate to one another.  </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>PURPOSE</b></div>
<div>My purpose is to create a
 social network on the internet that will connect people with similar 
situations, if not the same.  They will have the ability to connect with
 other people from all over the country and share their stories, make 
recommendations regarding anything from cancer centers to drug trials to
 natural remedies, or simply submit a question and get an honest answer 
from someone who is right in the thick of it with you.  People are suffering every day.  They deserve a place to go 
when they feel so completely alone.  I believe Patchwork is just that 
place. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>

<span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">For the past 1.5 years, we've been running a </span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">$45 a month unlimited classes studio out of JourneySpace founder's apartment.

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>Our dream is to raise $10,000. This would cover a few months of operating expenses (rent, salaries, insurance, marketing, etc.) in a shared space which has already been secured!

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<h3>What if We Fail?</h3>
<p>Oh no! That would never happen. But some folks have asked what would happen to donations if we fail to find space or decide not to reopen. All donations would be refunded. $500 level donors may opt out of a refund if they wish to keep their artwork, valued at $800 and above.</p>

<h3>Where will JourneySpace be Located?</h3>

<b>Why is JourneySpace so Important? </b><p></p>
<p>JourneySpace membership is as low as $45 per month for 4 classes per month and $70 per month for unlimited classes including Vinyasa Yoga, Zumba, Ballet Barre, and JourneyDance. We charge 50-60% less than other studios in the area because we believe that wellness should be accessible to everyone! Plus we offer...</p>

Help! There's a shortage of affordable wellness studios in New York City; even in Northern Manhattan's Washington Heights/Inwood community!


For the past 1.5 years, we've been running a $45 a month unlimited classes studio out of JourneySpace founder's apartment. We were 5 passionate, dedicated instructors teaching Yoga, Zumba Fitness, Ballet Barre, and JourneyDance and we want to keep this going and growing. 

But we can no longer use the existing space. So we desperately need a new home and that's where you come in.
  What We Need Our dream is to raise $10,000. This would cover a few months of operating expenses (rent, salaries, insurance, marketing, etc.) in a shared space which has already been secured! Should we fail to raise the full $10,000, but raise enough for at least one month of expenses, we will commence with classes October 27 or November 3rd. We will have from now until December 1 to enroll approximately 30 members for the studio to sustain itself. 

What if We Fail?
Oh no! That would never happen. But some folks have asked what would happen to donations if we fail to find space or decide not to reopen. All donations would be refunded. $500 level donors may opt out of a refund if they wish to keep their artwork, valued at $800 and above.



Where will JourneySpace be Located?
We found a lovely shared space on 190th & Bennett Avenue, only steps from both the ""A"" and ""#1"" train, Broadway & Fort Washington busses M4, M98, M100, Bx7.
Why is JourneySpace so Important? 
JourneySpace membership is as low as $45 per month for 4 classes per month and $70 per month for unlimited classes including Vinyasa Yoga, Zumba, Ballet Barre, and JourneyDance. We charge 50-60% less than other studios in the area because we believe that wellness should be accessible to everyone! Plus we offer...


A small community of down-to-earth, nonjudgmental, like-minded, and devoted members who have attended classes for the past 1.5 years.
Knowledgable teachers who absolutely love to teach and care deeply about their students.
Affordable Life Coaching offered to JourneySpace members, some of whom have reported and exhibit tremendous personal growth.

What participants have to say...


""I am in love with the Ballet that Maggie is teaching. She is such an effective, inspired, patient teacher that I just glow after each class.

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Our journey with Bay of Fungi began with a simple intention - to learn to grow gourmet mushrooms to feed our families. We knew of the incredible health benefits and nutrient content of gourmet mushrooms but, in reality, we couldn't afford to keep our fridges stocked! Our experience was that the gourmet mushrooms we loved - primarily shiitake, oyster and reishi - were either completely out of our price range or simply not available where we lived. </span><br/></p>
<p>And so our journey began - in our tiny kitchen with a gift pressure cooker and a bag full of Oyster mushroom spawn! </p>

</div>","Bay of Fungi is a campaign that will help us empower others to cultivate their own mushrooms. Your support will enable us to bring our 'Grow Your Own Gourmet Mushroom Kit' to life, as well as support the creation of our lab. These two aspects of our campaign will mean that folks far and wide will be able to explore growing gourmet mushrooms. 

We are Gavin, Nick and Ashley. We are Bay of Fungi. And we love mushrooms! 

    

Our journey with Bay of Fungi began with a simple intention - to learn to grow gourmet mushrooms to feed our families. We knew of the incredible health benefits and nutrient content of gourmet mushrooms but, in reality, we couldn't afford to keep our fridges stocked! Our experience was that the gourmet mushrooms we loved - primarily shiitake, oyster and reishi - were either completely out of our price range or simply not available where we lived. 
And so our journey began - in our tiny kitchen with a gift pressure cooker and a bag full of Oyster mushroom spawn! 


               

                                home grown blue oyster & shiitake mushrooms

WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED ON OUR PROGRESS VIA FACEBOOK AND OUR WEBSITE: themitneyproject.org. THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR INDIEGOGO SUPPORTERS FOR JOINING US AND HELPING TO RESTORE HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY IN THIS COMMUNITY!</h3>
<h3>CONGRATULATIONS TO KRISTEN HUNTER OF NORTH CAROLINA WHO WON OUR REFERRAL CONTEST! TO HER WE SAY: ""MUCHISIMAS GRACIAS Y BUEN VIAJE!""</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mitney” is a West End word for “child.” Usually a bright -and maybe a little mischievous- child.</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Our start: “If opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door”</strong></p>
<p>In the poorest area of Georgetown, SC, ten friends and business acquaintances started discussing ways to help less privileged kids have a better quality of life.</p>
<p>Their vision of rebuilding the neglected West End community became The Mitney Project.</p>
<p>We called a town meeting and talked to everyone we know.</p>
<p>Several friends stepped in to help. Many volunteered as instructors: dancers, IT teachers, bankers. The County lent us 2 rooms in an old school and we started with a dance class for 23 kids.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Jazz class"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/858091/pictures/original/20130608012926-Kids_dancing_w2012.jpg?1370680168"" src="""" style="""" title=""Jazz class""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then something amazing happened….</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Dreams rekindled</strong></h3>
<p>Parents waiting in the halls asked for their own activity. Then a group of ten young boys came to ask if we could “give them something to do.” More people started telling us what they needed to create better lives for themselves.</p>
<p>So we created a homebuyer program for them. A computer class. A fitness class. Then a financial mastery class.</p>
<p>Some kids from a private school held a fundraiser and bought the boys a robotics kit. The arts council gave us some art supplies and asked some artists to give the kids lessons. </p>
<p><img alt=""Robotics students with stage 1 prototype"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/858092/pictures/original/20130608013310-Masterminds_043013_web.jpg?1370680395"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mitney Masterminds""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You get the picture. </p>
<p>The project grew organically, mostly thanks to friends who share their time and resources. In the past 3 years, we’ve served over 250 people and maxed out at 5 rooms in the old school.  The halls are full of the sounds music, learning and laughter.</p>
<p>But now we need more space.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>A community’s heart</strong></h3>
<p>With 7,600 square feet, the former warehouse that will be The West End Community Center has space for more than 500.</p>
<p>It is smack-dab in the middle – the heart - of our community; people can walk to the building from all around.</p>
<p>It will have a medical office with a dedicated neighborhood physician.</p>
<p>There will be a community kitchen with healthy cooking classes, a dance fitness studio and film and photography studio.</p>
<p>Rooms where adults and kids will learn about entrepreneurship and start small with a team of mentors to help them succeed.</p>
<p><img alt=""Biz Plan Competition"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/858068/pictures/original/20130608005711-Judges_Finalists_web.jpg?1370678235"" src="""" style="""" title=""Biz plan competition finalists and judges""/></p>
<p>There will be an open multipurpose place for community gatherings, and workshops and events other community partners want to share.</p>
<p>A safe space for living, sharing, creating art and growing better together.  A place to find a new dream for life and spread good into the neighborhood – and beyond.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Sharing with the world</strong></h3>
<p>Helping to finish the center is how people from all over the world become a part of this process.</p>
<p>So many people are pulling together to make this happen:</p>
<p>Volunteer roofers, carpenters and plumbers.  Composer Mark Mancina who let us use his beautiful composition for our video. The donors who gave us a roof system and a ton of drywall. The funders who awarded us a $99,000 matching grant to help with construction. </p>

“Mitney” is a West End word for “child.” Usually a bright -and maybe a little mischievous- child.
Our start: “If opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door”
In the poorest area of Georgetown, SC, ten friends and business acquaintances started discussing ways to help less privileged kids have a better quality of life.
Their vision of rebuilding the neglected West End community became The Mitney Project.
We called a town meeting and talked to everyone we know.
Several friends stepped in to help. Many volunteered as instructors: dancers, IT teachers, bankers. The County lent us 2 rooms in an old school and we started with a dance class for 23 kids.
 
 
Then something amazing happened….
 
Dreams rekindled
Parents waiting in the halls asked for their own activity. Then a group of ten young boys came to ask if we could “give them something to do.” More people started telling us what they needed to create better lives for themselves.
So we created a homebuyer program for them. A computer class. A fitness class. Then a financial mastery class.
Some kids from a private school held a fundraiser and bought the boys a robotics kit. The arts council gave us some art supplies and asked some artists to give the kids lessons. 

 
You get the picture. 
The project grew organically, mostly thanks to friends who share their time and resources. In the past 3 years, we’ve served over 250 people and maxed out at 5 rooms in the old school.  The halls are full of the sounds music, learning and laughter.
But now we need more space.
 
A community’s heart
With 7,600 square feet, the former warehouse that will be The West End Community Center has space for more than 500.
It is smack-dab in the middle – the heart - of our community; people can walk to the building from all around.
It will have a medical office with a dedicated neighborhood physician.
There will be a community kitchen with healthy cooking classes, a dance fitness studio and film and photography studio.
Rooms where adults and kids will learn about entrepreneurship and start small with a team of mentors to help them succeed.

There will be an open multipurpose place for community gatherings, and workshops and events other community partners want to share.
A safe space for living, sharing, creating art and growing better together.  A place to find a new dream for life and spread good into the neighborhood – and beyond.
 
Sharing with the world
Helping to finish the center is how people from all over the world become a part of this process.
So many people are pulling together to make this happen:
Volunteer roofers, carpenters and plumbers.  Composer Mark Mancina who let us use his beautiful composition for our video. The donors who gave us a roof system and a ton of drywall. The funders who awarded us a $99,000 matching grant to help with construction. 
We need to raise $101,000 in a month to be awarded the money, buy construction materials, wire the building for electricity and install plumbing. This is where you come in.

<p><br/>This is an audacious event that, if successful will change the status of Transcendent Compounds within Australia and perhaps even around the world! It will bring the community of users into the perceptions of the mainstream community in a positive way. *Transcendent Compounds are those Entheogens that are non-addictive, non-toxic and psychologically safe in an appropriate dose, set and setting. The term is important, both for legal reasons and because it does what it says on the label.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Detail</h3>
<p>The money will be used to rent a shopfront that can be used as a community space. This space will aim to provide several things both to the Entheogenic and broader community generally.</p>
<p>1. It will be a space where people who use Transcendent Compounds can gather and meet like minded people and where new people can find entry into our wonderful community. It will be a place from which we can visibly launch our healing work into the community and demonstrate to the general population that we are a valuable addition to society and not a menace.</p>
<p>2. Many people in society exist in a state of existential crisis. There is simply nowhere for them to go if they wish to discuss issues of meaning, purpose and existence, without having someone's dogma forced down their throats. This will provide such a location. It will be a space where anybody can come to discuss and explore meaning of life issues, such as purpose, destiny and metaphysics. Hopefully we can create a philosophical wonderland. Discussion will be governed by the ""Principles"" on which Community of Infinite Colour is founded. The first of these is that The TRUTH is not out there, or as Socrates put it ""all I know is that I know nothing"". Each person needs to figure life and meaning out for themselves and Community is about building a society where gurus and dogmas are obsolete and the recognition is that ""The First Disciple is always the First Heretic"". Discussions become discussions among equals where everyone commits to being both teacher and student (and yes, I admit I do sometimes have difficulty with the latter!). <br/>The philosophy is based on an intersection of Philosophical Rationalism, Scientific Rationalism and Mysticism.</p>
<p><br/>3. It will be a space where people who are experiencing difficulties in their lives can receive pastoral care and an escape from isolation. This care will be provided by Greg Kasarik and volunteers. Greg is a trained and experienced counsellor, who has been unable to find work in this area due to his drug law reform work. This will provide the perfect space for him to put his talents to use and allow him to do what he is best at: Helping people.</p>
<p>4. Anyone who has been following Greg Kasarik's activities for the last three years will know that he has a nearly watertight legal argument to the effect that Transcendent Compounds are legal within the state of Victoria for spiritual and religious purposes!</p>
<p>Community of Infinite Colour is a spiritual organisation that meets the legal criteria for ""religion"" under Australian Law. (Pending further legal advice, it will be kept unincorporated, thereby ensuring that Greg Kasarik's bears sole legal responsibility for all of its activities). Community will be providing the opportunity for ordinary folk to use Transcendent Compounds within spiritual frameworks. Initially, this will be quite limited and symbolic, so as to give the Victorian Government time to adjust and so that if any arrests are made not too many people are caught up in it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Legal Implications</h3>
<p>While it is not the main purpose of the space, the existence of an an actual spiritual organisation, Community of Infinite Colour, will force the Government to accept our validity as a spiritual community and abide by the provisions of Section 14 and Section 7 of The Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act (2006). Of course, they could arrest us and drag us through the High Court of Australia, where they will inevitably lose: We will pack the court with so much science and so many expert witnesses that they will rue the day they ever sought to demonise and persecute such ancient and wise teachers as the Sacred Plants.Finally, they could alter the wording of the Charter to remove our rights, but in doing so they would be admitting that their position is based purely on bigotry and ignorance, rather than the decades of science that I have thus far used to avoid arrest.</p>
<p>The Victorian Parliament knows they do not have a leg to stand on with this. I have publically tripped three times on the steps of parliament without being bothered. I have twice gone into a police station, told them about my use of sacred compounds and invited them to arrest me. On both times I walked free.</p>
<p>It is my goal to force this issue this year, so that by 2014, everyone in Victoria (and by extension the Australian Capital Territory, because the Victorian act is based on theirs) has the legally recognised right to use Transcendent Compounds as part of their spiritual practice.</p>
<p>This will not mean that your activities must go through Community of Infinite Colour to be legal. Both the Victorian and ACT acts give you the right to practice your religion (legal term) as an individual, if you choose.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>$33,333.33 is about a third of what we expect to need in order to get this project up and running. <br/>Depending on location and size, a shopfront can be expected to cost between $25,000 to $60,000 per year, plus outgoings such as heating, rates and other expenses. Obviously, we'll be looking at starting small! :-)</p>
<p>Additional expenses can be expected with respect to planning permits to the local council, as this will be considered a ""Place of Assembly"".Should enough funds be raised, additional moneys will be used to provide Greg Kasarik with a living wage, so that he can be present at the location on a full time basis. Until that time, the opening hours will be based entirely on volunteer availability, although weekend opening is a priority.</p>
<p>Additional legal expenses may be incurred should the Government seek to challenge us in the courts, but these funds will not be used for that purpose.</p>
<p>Should the full funds not be raised, those funds that are raised will go towards some sort of Community Space, even if it is only a house in a residential street.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Plese note, that at the outset, there are almost no ""Rewards"" for contributing above a certain amount, although we are in the process of putting together a series of stickers and posters as rewards, the artwork for these is not yet available.</span></p>
<p>We looked into a variety of sacred plants, seeds and cuttings and free participation in Ayahuasca and Mushroom circles for higher amounts, but decided against this because this might be percieved as being against the Indigogo Terms and Conditions. There is already a good chance that this event will be prematurely closed, so there is nothing to be gained from adding more fuel to the fire. </p>
<p>Frankly, if you need a ""gift"" to donate to a project such as this, we haven't quite gotten through to you...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> <br/>The Impact - A Personal Message from Greg Kasarik.</h3>
<p>This needs to be done!</p>
<p>We don't have official figures, but guess that those using of Transcendent Compounds (AKA Entheogens) for Spiritual purposes form the largest growing spiritual community in many parts of the world, including Australia.</p>
<p>Despite this, I regularly encounter two things when speaking with members of the Entheogenic Community. Whenever I speak to people, they cry out for the need for a space that they can call their own; where they can meet and exchange ideas with those on a similar journey. They feel the isolation of being a silent and misunderstood minority.</p>
<p>The second thing I regularly encounter is fear. I experience it myself (as I type this, I feel it sitting like a lump of dead coal in my chest) and it robs far too many of us of our vitality. We hide who we are and we lie to those we love, for fear of losing our families, jobs, friends and loved ones. If we are to ever thrive as a community and as individuals, we need to throw off the chains that bind us and make the firm decision that we, as a community, are going to be the authors of our own destinies.</p>
<p>The legal argument is as solid as it is ever going to be. If we don't act now, we risk missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime. There is now a critical mass for change within the Entheogenic Community. Entheogenesis Australis (EGA), who so courageously led the way are now more than a decade old. Each year sees a profusion of books and research and a greater profusion of evidence that our path is not only safe and sacred, but highly beneficial to those with the courage to make the journey.</p>
<p>I fully acknowledge that this action will produce a backlash amongst the more fanatical and intolerant members of our society. But this backlash is coming one way, or another. In a decade EGA went from a handful of people in a community room in Nunawadding to nearly seven hundred at a four day outdoor conference in the Strathbogie Ranges in 2011. With this kind of growth it will only be a few more years before we are noticed and fall victim to the hatreds of bigotry and ignorance. I firmly believe that our best hope lies in taking the initiative and demonstrating to our fellow citizens that we are not ""druggies"", but are instead worthwhile and contributing members of society.</p>
<p>Solid support will make it clear to the politicians that we are a genuine community and not to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<p>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.<br/>Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!<br/>And that’s all there is to it.</p></div>","Raising $33,333.33 as initial funding for a community space for the Australian Entheogenic community and as a space where people in Victoria can LEGALLY experience journeys into the Divine Consciousness using Transcendent Compounds.

Plese note, that at the outset, there are almost no ""Rewards"" for contributing above a certain amount, although we are in the process of putting together a series of stickers and posters as rewards, the artwork for these is not yet available.
We looked into a variety of sacred plants, seeds and cuttings and free participation in Ayahuasca and Mushroom circles for higher amounts, but decided against this because this might be percieved as being against the Indigogo Terms and Conditions. There is already a good chance that this event will be prematurely closed, so there is nothing to be gained from adding more fuel to the fire. 
Frankly, if you need a ""gift"" to donate to a project such as this, we haven't quite gotten through to you...
 
 The Impact - A Personal Message from Greg Kasarik.
This needs to be done!
We don't have official figures, but guess that those using of Transcendent Compounds (AKA Entheogens) for Spiritual purposes form the largest growing spiritual community in many parts of the world, including Australia.
Despite this, I regularly encounter two things when speaking with members of the Entheogenic Community. Whenever I speak to people, they cry out for the need for a space that they can call their own; where they can meet and exchange ideas with those on a similar journey. They feel the isolation of being a silent and misunderstood minority.
The second thing I regularly encounter is fear. I experience it myself (as I type this, I feel it sitting like a lump of dead coal in my chest) and it robs far too many of us of our vitality. We hide who we are and we lie to those we love, for fear of losing our families, jobs, friends and loved ones. If we are to ever thrive as a community and as individuals, we need to throw off the chains that bind us and make the firm decision that we, as a community, are going to be the authors of our own destinies.
The legal argument is as solid as it is ever going to be. If we don't act now, we risk missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime. There is now a critical mass for change within the Entheogenic Community. Entheogenesis Australis (EGA), who so courageously led the way are now more than a decade old. Each year sees a profusion of books and research and a greater profusion of evidence that our path is not only safe and sacred, but highly beneficial to those with the courage to make the journey.
I fully acknowledge that this action will produce a backlash amongst the more fanatical and intolerant members of our society. But this backlash is coming one way, or another. In a decade EGA went from a handful of people in a community room in Nunawadding to nearly seven hundred at a four day outdoor conference in the Strathbogie Ranges in 2011. With this kind of growth it will only be a few more years before we are noticed and fall victim to the hatreds of bigotry and ignorance. I firmly believe that our best hope lies in taking the initiative and demonstrating to our fellow citizens that we are not ""druggies"", but are instead worthwhile and contributing members of society.
Solid support will make it clear to the politicians that we are a genuine community and not to be taken lightly.

<h3>Hello, my name is Julia. I'm a single, struggling mother who desperately needs help. I was working full time as a medical biller, part time acting, college full time double majoring in Criminal Justice and Real Estate, as well as organizing rallies-then I got into a car accident. My car was totaled. Since then our life has gotten worse and worse. I lost my job, had to withdraw from classes, got evicted, and have tried with every ounce of my heart and might to survive since then. I am the first one in my family to graduate from high school, get college educated and make something of myself. I was raised in the motels of Orange County, Ca. and was forced to do unimaginable things to make sure my mother was taken care of. I decided finally that I would change my life, I was determined to make a life that  was honorable. My goals in life are to help others, show a good example to my son, and live successfully so he never has to live through the struggles and pain I've been through. My situation of not having a car has had a detrimental effect on our lives and my pursuit to give JP the life he deserves with no stress. We are currently sleeping on the floor in a tiny apartment we managed to get into, and there is no nearby public transportation. If I can buy a vehicle, that will give us the foot up we need to get things moving forward and back in order. I've looked into organizations and tried contacting family too, but they all struggle too so they can't help others. This is our last hope.</h3>

<p><b>The Facts  </b></p>
<p>When you donate through Indiegogo, you’ll be part of a
larger fundraising effort that will continue throughout the year. We have until
January 20<sup>th</sup> to scholarship at least FIVE campers through the first
online campaign. We get to keep ALL of what we raise no matter if we reach or
exceed our goal. Indiegogo charges a 4% fee on the amount raised, but this is
the lowest fee of the sites like this. Check out the quick facts to see how the
funds are used.  </p>

<p>Like you heard on last year’s video, Camp Cedar Cliff is a
life-shaping, incredible way to strengthen a child’s relationship with Christ.
Camp often introduces kids to what it means to know God.  Sometimes counselors’ extra attention

their own confidence. Will you be a part of shaping kid’s lives? </p>

<h3>The Ceilidh</h3>
</div>
<div>What happens when four women from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania spend a combined 22+ years in the book (and cafe!) industry and their store closes? After many happy years working with Borders, we now find it's time for us to go out on our own and do it the way we know it should be done.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our hope is to become your third place. Home. Work. Ceilidh. One day, we'd like to have a store front that embodies the Gaelic concept of a ceilidh (Káylee). Though the meaning of ceilidh has changed over the years, one aspect always remains intact: a ceilidh is a community gathering, a celebration. This is the most basic facet of our business. We aim to bring people together, one book, one latte, one surprising conversation at a time.<br/><br/>Before we can get to the point of having a physical location where you can sit and talk with friends and strangers, discussing books, sipping hot chocolate, encompassed by the music of a live band and local artwork lining the walls, we must begin elsewhere. We must begin selling books via our website. Although our future customers are scattered across the globe, we remain connected. A ceilidh in name and spirit.<br/><br/>Help us begin the conversation and the celebration.</div>
<div>
<h3>How You Can Help Us</h3>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, we were able to pay for all those pesky legal fees to operate in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Yay! Thank you to all of those that made that possible!</li>
<li>Secondly, building a sleek, effient, and user-friendly website with actual shopping carts is imperative to our future growth as a company. A functioning online store is the ultimate goal of this particular fundraiser. Your contributions will go directly to help make this goal a success.</li>
<li>Additionally, the contributions made will go towards all of the perks, including our Sign and Dine Event.</li>
<li>Any further contributions past our goal will go towards the actuation of our dream: a brick and mortar store. The POS system we have been drooling over is not cheap, that is for sure, but it will grow well with us and make life down the line a lot smoother (and dare we say sexier?). Also, any extra money will go towards acquiring new book titles and of course, the actual location.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Long-Term Impacts</h3>
<ul>
<li>They will be just as delicious as the short-term impacts. With any bit you contribute, you will bring us one step closer to creating the inviting and inspiring space for which we have been planning. Our eventual book store will be more than just a book store. We will be a place where our community can investigate creative outlets and become better for it.</li>
<li>The Ceilidh has agreements with a few local authors (Maria V. Snyder,  Megan Hart, and Nicole Peeler to name a few) to be the exclusive seller of personalized signed copies of their books. Not only will the Ceilidh provide you with a service like this (in only a few clicks, mind you) but we will also be helping these wonderful ladies reach corners of their market that otherwise would be untouched. We'd love for services like this to catch on across the nation. After all, it will only help the publishing industry as a whole.</li>
<li>
<strong>You'll receive awesome items to display your pride in helping a small business and a growing community. You may even experience an event to remember for a lifetime. Once we are ready to launch our website, we will hold a public signing event held locally in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. </strong><strong>One of the few possible perks is a ticket to the dining portion our Sign and Dine event. This is where you'll get to schmooze with authors while eating deliciously catered food. Even if you aren't in our area, we have some great personalized signing options. See side panel for more information.<br/></strong>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>Hey, I'm Jas with Afiniti Digital, and thanks for checking us out. Afiniti Digital has been my dream ever since I first started coding, years ago. I like to design web pages and web art, and if I can make a living out of it, so much the better. First though, I need funding so I can actually start to work.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are costs associated with starting a business, as I'm sure many of you know. In order of importance, I'd like to get some business cards and advertising, buy some real computers and tech (An HP Compaq doesn't really cut it, nor does a 12mp point-and-shoot), and eventually have my own office.</div>
<p>I have some help from friends and family, who have been extremely supportive from the start, but I'm going to need a lot more so we can get this off of the ground.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>Our first bit of funding will go towards some real business cards, because we're definitely going to need to get the word out. The next priority is good technology with which we can work on. This doesn't necessarily need to be top of the line (though I still drool at the screen on the new MacBook Pro with Retina Display), but better than the crap we're running with now. A DSLR would be next, to get some stock pictures and to get some pictures of businesses we'll be developing for.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Upto that is all I've really put in as a goal, but if it can go further, that'd work just as well. We'd like to eventually have our own local office, and although hardwood floors and glass would be nice, we'll settle for a corner somewhere.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'll be honest, and say that there's no specific way you'll be helping the world by contributing. If we ever become succesful, we'll definitely donate to charities and more projects on sites like these, but for the immediate future all your funding will go to help us build up as a company. You would however, be helping a couple of kids who recently graduated from high school (about a week ago, in fact) with their ultimate dream.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
We know very well that some people can't contribute monetarily, and thats totally cool.What would be even cooler is if you can get the word out about us. Know someone who needs a website? Refer to us.</div></div>","Short Summary

(ICIW) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit youth organization  founded  to motivate and inspire youth in Chester, PA . ICIW was co-founded by Michael Gray II, Markus Gray, and Michael Gray Sr., in 2007 for youth ages 3 through 16. The purpose of the organization is to teach and reinforce learning about  the arts, agriculture, economics, and basic business concepts at a young age. With that in mind, participating youth are encouraged to develop small business ventures within their neighborhood. Our children are  at the core of our multi-award winning Community Garden Program, where they apply the skills they've learned in agriculture, economics, and teamwork. Fathers, mothers,  and the entire community are encouraged to participate in our youth development programs. We strive to instill our slogan “I can achieve my goals, I will realize my dreams”, in every child that our program touches.

</h1><h1></h1><h2><span>What are we trying to do?</span></h2>Through our saturday program we have realized that art has grown to be one of the biggest outlets for our children and to encourage the development of our young artists we are working to build an art center in the city of Chester, Pa. Through this campaign we are looking to raised $100,000 to build a state of the art art center to continue to teach our kids the value of the arts. We plan on hosting art classes and hosting art shows to showcase the city’s talents. Your donation will go along way even if its just $1, you can help build a lifelong impact on the life of our children. <p></p><p><br/></p><h1></h1><h2><span>Our Rewards</span></h2><p>Our rewards listed below are very special, they were painted by the late “Andrew Turner Sr.”, who was a native of Chester, Pa. He was a close friend and teacher of the founder of ICIW and has had a lasting impact upon him.</p><h3>Andrew Turner, American (1944 - 2001)</h3><p>Andrew Turner was born in l944 in Chester, Pennsylvania. He was a graduate of Temple University's Tyler School of Art. Andrew's work has been widely acclaimed, with many solo exhibitions and participation in group exhibitions. He has taught art in grades K-1 2 in the Chester, Pennsylvania Public Schools and in correctional centers.</p><p>His appointments include Artist-in-Residence and Curator, Deshong Museum, Chester, PA; Lecturer, Widener University; Lecturer, Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and, he toured and lectured in The People's Republic of China. Collections which hold Andrew's paintings include Woody Allen, Dr. Maya Angelou, ARCO Chemical Company, Bell Telephone Company, Dr. Constance Clayton, Mr. and Mrs. Bill Cosby, Edie Huggins, Eric Lindros, Mr. and Mrs Louis Madonni, Moses Malone, Penn State University, the artist formerly known as Prince, Mr. and Mrs. Harold Sorgenti, Swarthmore College, Mrs. Marilyn Wheaton, and Widener University Deshong Museum, just to name a few. He has been featured in numerous solo exhibitions and group exhibitions in the United States and abroad. His Philadelphia commissions include: WDAS FM (1996); Marco Solo, (published by J. Schwinn and G. Harlow, illustrated by Andrew Turner) Reverse Angle Productions, Inc. (I 995); and Robin Hood Dell, Fairmount Park (1985). </p><br/><p>""My paintings combine the drama inherent in seventeenth century Dutch painting with the brush work and the economy of the Impressionists. However, I look to the jazz idiom more so than to other contemporary visual artists for guidance and inspiration. I tend to measure the success of my pieces by how they stand up technically, emotionally and innovatively to a Coltrane solo or whether I've captured the spirit of the occasion, a la Ellington.

(ICIW) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit youth organization  founded  to motivate and inspire youth in Chester, PA . ICIW was co-founded by Michael Gray II, Markus Gray, and Michael Gray Sr., in 2007 for youth ages 3 through 16. The purpose of the organization is to teach and reinforce learning about  the arts, agriculture, economics, and basic business concepts at a young age. With that in mind, participating youth are encouraged to develop small business ventures within their neighborhood. Our children are  at the core of our multi-award winning Community Garden Program, where they apply the skills they've learned in agriculture, economics, and teamwork. Fathers, mothers,  and the entire community are encouraged to participate in our youth development programs. We strive to instill our slogan “I can achieve my goals, I will realize my dreams”, in every child that our program touches. To see our work over the years please like us on Facebook.



What are we trying to do?Through our saturday program we have realized that art has grown to be one of the biggest outlets for our children and to encourage the development of our young artists we are working to build an art center in the city of Chester, Pa. Through this campaign we are looking to raised $100,000 to build a state of the art art center to continue to teach our kids the value of the arts. We plan on hosting art classes and hosting art shows to showcase the city’s talents. Your donation will go along way even if its just $1, you can help build a lifelong impact on the life of our children. Our RewardsOur rewards listed below are very special, they were painted by the late “Andrew Turner Sr.”, who was a native of Chester, Pa. He was a close friend and teacher of the founder of ICIW and has had a lasting impact upon him.Andrew Turner, American (1944 - 2001)Andrew Turner was born in l944 in Chester, Pennsylvania. He was a graduate of Temple University's Tyler School of Art. Andrew's work has been widely acclaimed, with many solo exhibitions and participation in group exhibitions. He has taught art in grades K-1 2 in the Chester, Pennsylvania Public Schools and in correctional centers.His appointments include Artist-in-Residence and Curator, Deshong Museum, Chester, PA; Lecturer, Widener University; Lecturer, Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and, he toured and lectured in The People's Republic of China. Collections which hold Andrew's paintings include Woody Allen, Dr. Maya Angelou, ARCO Chemical Company, Bell Telephone Company, Dr. Constance Clayton, Mr. and Mrs. Bill Cosby, Edie Huggins, Eric Lindros, Mr. and Mrs Louis Madonni, Moses Malone, Penn State University, the artist formerly known as Prince, Mr. and Mrs. Harold Sorgenti, Swarthmore College, Mrs. Marilyn Wheaton, and Widener University Deshong Museum, just to name a few. He has been featured in numerous solo exhibitions and group exhibitions in the United States and abroad. His Philadelphia commissions include: WDAS FM (1996); Marco Solo, (published by J. Schwinn and G. Harlow, illustrated by Andrew Turner) Reverse Angle Productions, Inc. (I 995); and Robin Hood Dell, Fairmount Park (1985). ""My paintings combine the drama inherent in seventeenth century Dutch painting with the brush work and the economy of the Impressionists. However, I look to the jazz idiom more so than to other contemporary visual artists for guidance and inspiration. I tend to measure the success of my pieces by how they stand up technically, emotionally and innovatively to a Coltrane solo or whether I've captured the spirit of the occasion, a la Ellington. The subject matter, sometimes nostalgic recollections of my days as a young tough, covers a myriad of common folk activities. The setting usually my native Chester, is a beehive of creative stimulation or a deteriorating ghetto depending on my state of mind. At the very least, hopefully, these vignettes of experience will help to provide insight into some African American lifestyles and serve as an inspiration to my students and others to continue the legacy of African American participation in the arts.""Washing Dishes : $10,00018x22: Acrylic on CanvasRainy Day: $10,00013x36: Acrylic on CanvasDance: $10,00024x30: Acrylic on CanvasLady Band: $10,00024x36: Acrylic on CanvasParty: $10,00024x48: Acrylic on WoodGirls in Door: $10,00012x48: Acrylic on BoardMan with Cane: $5,00016x40:  Acylic on CanvasPlay : $5,00016x20:  Acrylic on Canvas PanelFlowers: $5,00018x24: Acrylic on Canvas PanelTime out: $5,00014x18: Acrylic on CanvasBath: $5,00016x20:  Acrylic on Canvas PanelTruck Ride: $25 - $5017.5 x 24 : PrintSax: $10025x31: Print

more than just beer. It is about remembering the 1000s of young men and women
who have done their bit for our nation’s security. In doing so I hope to
provide a place where people can come and tell their stories or learn about
those who gave so much for us. As a returned veteran of the Iraq war I know how
important it is for our servicemen and women to be recognised for their
sacrifice and how little the general public really know about their lives.<br/><br/>
Located in the Central Goldfields of Victoria, just minutes from major tourist
destinations such as Hepburn Springs, Daylesford and only 40 mins from two of
Victoria’s most historic goldmining cities, Bendigo and Ballarat, and amongst
many of central Victoria’s boutique wineries <i>The Last Post Brewery</i> will
provide a quiet place to enjoy the surrounds and sample some of the state’s
newest beers, all in an idyllic country setting. <br/><br/>
A new craft beer…traditionally brewed, environmentally conscious and full of
complex flavours our beers are 100% brewed on site using the finest spring
waters from nearby Mt Franklin and all feature unique blends of Australian
Malts and Hops. Welcome to <i>The Last Post Brewery.</i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/587183/files/20140518080553-1528586_10151891922817404_182731757_n.jpg?1400425553"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>Unique and Novel</b></span><br/></p>
<p>Craft breweries are becoming more
common as discerning Australian beer drinkers are looking for beers with more
flavour and character. This is exactly what you will find at <i>The Last Post
Brewery</i>. BUT; In order to capitalise on the uniqueness that abounds in central
Victoria we have a twist on a theme. Not only will <i>The Last Post Brewery
</i>provide you with high quality, original Aussie beers, but we will also come to
you. Yes that’s right. We’ll be mobile! As a memorial to the many volunteers
who protect our community from our service men and women to our CFA and other
emergency volunteer organisations I intend on refurbishing an old fire truck
and fitting it out with all the important features such as beer taps, kegs and
other packaged products to suit all needs. We will feature quality organic meat
products from nearby Angel Organics, a local certified organic beef and lamb
producer, with a BBQ on board. The Last Post Brew Truck will travel to your
function or event and provide you with an instant Pub on site, complete with
BBQ facilities and functioning fire-fighting pump and hoses which we’ll leave
their potential uses up to your imagination. </p><p>Around the local area, there are a number of high quality wineries and other historically significant tourist attractions. The entire region will benefit from the increased patronage. The truck will be used to take small group tours of the region incorporating some of the local wineries and historic sites and will also be available for hire as a Novelty Transport vehicle. Formals, Debutante Balls, Weddings, Hens Nights, Bucks Nights, Sporting Clubs functions, you name it. The sky's the limit and with my imagination and your support, anything is possible.</p>
<p>Victorian’s deserve the best and this
is what we hope to bring to your door. <br/><br/><b>
What are you drinking?</b></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">At the heart of our product range are quality ingredients. Beer consists of
four main ingredients: water, malted grain, hops and yeast. Every beer brewed
at <i>The Last Post Brewery</i> will start with a base of water from the Mt Franklin
springs (just 15mins away) and will also feature quality Australian produce
varying from quality Tasmanian grown hops, to locally sourced grains. Some
beers will feature products from overseas in order to capture the unique
flavours and memories that we will hopefully become renowned for. Rest assured,
each beer will ALWAYS feature intrinsically Australian produce. </span></p><p>
Some of the beer recipes include ingredients such as rolled oats, golden
syrup, aniseed, coriander and seasonal fruits. </p><p><i>The Last Post Brewery’s</i> beers will be unique. There are already a great
many craft breweries throughout Victoria and Australia and we aim to be
different. Each beer will be brewed based loosely on the style to which it is
intended but we want to think outside the bottle (pun intended) somewhat in our

</b></b></b><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></h3></div>","The Last Post Brewery is about
more than just beer. It is about remembering the 1000s of young men and women
who have done their bit for our nation’s security. In doing so I hope to
provide a place where people can come and tell their stories or learn about
those who gave so much for us. As a returned veteran of the Iraq war I know how
important it is for our servicemen and women to be recognised for their
sacrifice and how little the general public really know about their lives.
Located in the Central Goldfields of Victoria, just minutes from major tourist
destinations such as Hepburn Springs, Daylesford and only 40 mins from two of
Victoria’s most historic goldmining cities, Bendigo and Ballarat, and amongst
many of central Victoria’s boutique wineries The Last Post Brewery will
provide a quiet place to enjoy the surrounds and sample some of the state’s
newest beers, all in an idyllic country setting. 
A new craft beer…traditionally brewed, environmentally conscious and full of
complex flavours our beers are 100% brewed on site using the finest spring
waters from nearby Mt Franklin and all feature unique blends of Australian
Malts and Hops. Welcome to The Last Post Brewery.Unique and Novel
Craft breweries are becoming more
common as discerning Australian beer drinkers are looking for beers with more
flavour and character. This is exactly what you will find at The Last Post
Brewery. BUT; In order to capitalise on the uniqueness that abounds in central
Victoria we have a twist on a theme. Not only will The Last Post Brewery
provide you with high quality, original Aussie beers, but we will also come to
you. Yes that’s right. We’ll be mobile! As a memorial to the many volunteers
who protect our community from our service men and women to our CFA and other
emergency volunteer organisations I intend on refurbishing an old fire truck
and fitting it out with all the important features such as beer taps, kegs and
other packaged products to suit all needs. We will feature quality organic meat
products from nearby Angel Organics, a local certified organic beef and lamb
producer, with a BBQ on board. The Last Post Brew Truck will travel to your
function or event and provide you with an instant Pub on site, complete with
BBQ facilities and functioning fire-fighting pump and hoses which we’ll leave
their potential uses up to your imagination. Around the local area, there are a number of high quality wineries and other historically significant tourist attractions. The entire region will benefit from the increased patronage. The truck will be used to take small group tours of the region incorporating some of the local wineries and historic sites and will also be available for hire as a Novelty Transport vehicle. Formals, Debutante Balls, Weddings, Hens Nights, Bucks Nights, Sporting Clubs functions, you name it. The sky's the limit and with my imagination and your support, anything is possible.
Victorian’s deserve the best and this
is what we hope to bring to your door. 
What are you drinking?At the heart of our product range are quality ingredients. Beer consists of
four main ingredients: water, malted grain, hops and yeast. Every beer brewed
at The Last Post Brewery will start with a base of water from the Mt Franklin
springs (just 15mins away) and will also feature quality Australian produce
varying from quality Tasmanian grown hops, to locally sourced grains. Some
beers will feature products from overseas in order to capture the unique
flavours and memories that we will hopefully become renowned for. Rest assured,
each beer will ALWAYS feature intrinsically Australian produce. 
Some of the beer recipes include ingredients such as rolled oats, golden
syrup, aniseed, coriander and seasonal fruits. The Last Post Brewery’s beers will be unique. There are already a great
many craft breweries throughout Victoria and Australia and we aim to be
different. Each beer will be brewed based loosely on the style to which it is
intended but we want to think outside the bottle (pun intended) somewhat in our
production process. By doing so, we hope to create a uniquely Australian and
Victorian product not seen anywhere else. It will be different, it will taste
different and you will love it, so be warned.The Last Post Brewery’s intentOur concept is one of remembrance. People make this country what it is.

</h3><p></p><p>VETIVER is a new farm in downtown New Orleans, LA.  With your support and the help of our friends and neighbors,  we're developing a working urban farm to grow organically-raised produce and plant starts, while functioning as a hub and a resource center for other growers - physically and virtually.  We've been fortunate to secure a half-acre spot in an excellent location that will also allow us to offer educational opportunities in the form of classes, demonstrations, community-based events. </p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/570360/files/20140510085112-vetiver-0657.jpg?1399737072"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Our challenge now is to convert an overgrown, trash-filled lot into a safe and functional growing space; tackling issues that most urban growers face (soil contamination and the like), but exacerbated by New Orleans' specific environmental history.

</div><p></p><p></p><p>With so many restaurants, catering companies, cafés, food trucks &amp; pop-ups in New Orleans, the amount of biodegradable waste that ends up in the landfill is astounding. More than 1/2 of what’s going into the landfill is paper &amp; food waste. By offering compost collection to businesses, VETIVER will turn local food &amp; paper waste into a nutrient-rich soil amendment through composting. Additionally, we'll track the number of pounds of biodegradable waste each business diverts from the landfill to support urban agriculture.

VETIVER is commencing in a time of a food paradox: in 2011, New Orleans 
was labeled America's worst food desert while simultaneously lauded 
""America's Best City for Foodies"" (New Orleans Doubles as Food Desert

 Among one of the things the city lacks is a sustainable grower of

we grow is dependent on the support of folks like you.<br/><br/>

 making New Orleans one of the poorest cities in the country. In an area
 where a bag of chips is often less expensive and more accessible than

VETIVER is a new farm in downtown New Orleans, LA.  With your support and the help of our friends and neighbors,  we're developing a working urban farm to grow organically-raised produce and plant starts, while functioning as a hub and a resource center for other growers - physically and virtually.  We've been fortunate to secure a half-acre spot in an excellent location that will also allow us to offer educational opportunities in the form of classes, demonstrations, community-based events. Our challenge now is to convert an overgrown, trash-filled lot into a safe and functional growing space; tackling issues that most urban growers face (soil contamination and the like), but exacerbated by New Orleans' specific environmental history. We're seeking funding to cover a portion of our project start-up costs, of which mulch and soil are a huge component. WHO ARE WE?VETIVER is founded by Nicola Krebill and Keenan McDonald.  Keenan and Nico have 12 years combined experience in farming, along with diverse & extensive experience in food production (farming, gardening, baking, butchery, cooking), food distribution, and urban agricultural advocacy.Nico has spent 8 years as a community organizer in New Orleans, most recently as the City Farms Director at the New Orleans Food & Farm Network.  NOFFN is an organization that aims to localize the food system in the New Orleans region by increasing the number of edible gardens, developing collaborative urban agriculture projects, and supporting food system linkages within the New Orleans foodshed.  Nico also founded and has operated Community Kitchen Collective, a wholly volunteer-run food share in New Orleans that brings together individuals who love to grow, gather, cook, and serve food; thereby reducing food waste and abating hunger, while supporting those most marginalized by capitalism and the industrial food system. Community Kitchen has served weekly free meals for over 2 years.Keenan has farmed and managed diverse farm operations including produce and variety of livestock for over 7 years, primarily in North Carolina.  Prior to relocating to New Orleans, Keenan managed vegetable production for a large certified organic farm in Central Louisiana.  She set direction for greenhouse production of transplants for field and for retail sales, as well as developed restaurant, wholesale and retail business in NOLA -  with direct sales to roughly 40 of the most creative and highly regarded restaurants in the city.  VETIVER will leverage deep existing community relationships with food producers, restaurants, wholesalers, and the like to expand on more traditional marketing and advertising efforts.  Both Nico and Keenan have backgrounds in art, photography, technology, and writing in public, private, and fine arts sectors. Prior to farming, Keenan spent a decade in Raleigh/Durham, NC and Chicago, IL engaged in branding and design consulting.  Nico is an acclaimed photographer with over 12 years of experience in technology and website development.  VETIVER will maintain a substantial online presence and also endeavor to function as a digital information resource hub.  OUR PLANVETIVER's main goal is to produce fresh food and facilitate its production for the Greater New Orleans area. What that looks like to us:TRANSPLANTS/PLANT STARTSVETIVER will offer a Greenhouse-Driven Custom Transplant Production Program for area farmers; high-quality vegetable and herb plant starts sustainably produced from non-GMO seed. Transplants will also be made available at a discount for local Community Gardens, and for retail sale to Backyard & Restaurant/Kitchen gardeners.FRESH PRODUCEIt's hard to deny the incredible local demand for exceptionally high-quality, locally produced premium baby greens! We'll grow for direct-marketing primarily to restaurants, but also wholesale (vendors such as Hollygrove Market & Good Eggs), and through Farmers’ Market venues.
Premium Baby Greens such as Arugula, Mixed Lettuces, Spinach, Sorrel, Mizuna, and Yukina Savoy. 

Extensive Variety of Micro-greens and Shoots 

Culinary and Medicinal Herbs

DISTRIBUTION HUB Despite the exceptional growth rate of urban farms & gardens in NOLA and beyond – there is a definite dearth of locally accessible, sustainably-produced and sourced gardening supplies such as bulk seed (rare, heirloom and/or cover crop seed), soils, compost, soil amendments, starts such as seed potatoes and other tubers, plugs, and slips. Organic pesticides and non-synthetic fertilizers are often only available from faraway national locations that require expensive shipping in large quantities that can be cost-prohibitive for individual growers or small farmers. Our intention is to be a resource for the sustainable agricultural community in Louisiana and Southern Mississippi.CONSULTING Our plan is to offer consultative services for restaurants, community groups, businesses, and/or individuals seeking to create, revamp, or maintain urban gardens. These services will be integrated with our custom transplant production.COMMUNITY OUTREACH & WEBSITEIn addition to the production of seedlings & transplants, baby greens, micro-greens & shoots, VETIVER will offer educational opportunities in the form of classes, demonstrations, community-based events. Phase Two of our project involves creating and maintaining a dynamic information rich website that will serve as a resource for farmers, backyard growers, environmentally-conscious consumers, and the food systems community.COMPOST PICKUP SERVICE






With so many restaurants, catering companies, cafés, food trucks & pop-ups in New Orleans, the amount of biodegradable waste that ends up in the landfill is astounding. More than 1/2 of what’s going into the landfill is paper & food waste. By offering compost collection to businesses, VETIVER will turn local food & paper waste into a nutrient-rich soil amendment through composting. Additionally, we'll track the number of pounds of biodegradable waste each business diverts from the landfill to support urban agriculture. Compost adds organic matter, beneficial bacteria, and nutrients to the soil needed for healthy plant growth and improves the physical properties of soil for good aeration, water retention, and pest and weed control. In the future, we hope to expand to offer residential compost pickup as well.HOW DO WE GET THERE?We're asking for help to raise $24,000  - which is about half of what we expect our start-up/expenses to be for the rest of 2014.  Your contribution will enable us to get up and running until we can begin generating income.  Here's a rough outline of our projected expenses:  Mulch/Soil (Sourcing/Hauling/Spreading): $12,000
Minimum of 18"" Base Mulch Layer/Soil

In the past eleven months I have been taken by storm as this
Brooklyn boy went from the daily routine of putting on my construction boots,
inhaling clouds of dust & hammering away to working with ingredients such
as flour, sugar & eggsâ€¦yes, I am talking about BAKING! You see my love for
baking came about for one simple reason I LOVE to eat cake! The thought of
baking professionally never crossed my mind until -my creative wife aka â€œMaster
Wedding Plannerâ€ told me to give the cupcake world a shot! Within weeks of
friends & family graciously being my taste testers (hard job) the delicious
treats that I began creating started to be noticed & JJs Rockin Cupcakes
soon came to life!
In the last year that we have been up and running we have
grown in leaps and bounds, aside from taking special orders we have moved
directly into the public eye;
Â·        
In June 2011 I started selling cupcakes during
â€œCupcake Wednesdayâ€™sâ€ in my wifeâ€™s office.
Â·        
In November 2011 we outgrew â€œCupcake
Wednesdayâ€™sâ€ and I moved down the street to a
 â€œTo-Goâ€ Window (think Drive Through)
Â·        
Now we have the â€œTo-Goâ€ window and are even
shipping our cupcakes nationwide!
The Impact
By the end of 2011 we were also featured in a variety of
media including:
Â·        
The Times Harold Record
Â·        
The Chronogram
Â·        
The Lincoln Eagle
Â·        
The Kingston Times
Â·        
CY Magazine
Â·        
The Style Socialite Blog
Â·        
The Poughkeepsie Journal
Â·        
2011 ""Our wedding Planner"" By the
Poughkeepsie Journal
In the midst of all of this we have been a part of a variety
of events from Mercedes Benz Fashion
Week in New York City, to celebrity birthday bashes, TLCâ€™s Four Weddings, book
signings, weddings, sweet 16â€™s, a private media retreat at The Bowery House for
The Glamazon Diaries (post Fashion Week) and a variety of fundraisers with
local schools, ARCS and Relay for life. If this werenâ€™t enough, we were awarded
business of the year by Marist College! 
Over the years my wife and I have dedicated our time to
helping out our community through cupcake donations, monetary donations and
just giving our time to many non for profits. We may not have much to give but
what we do we are more than willing to share. A few of the places we have
donated goods or services are:
Â·        
The Ronald McDonald House
Â·        
Childrenâ€™s Diabetes Center in Queens Hospital
Â·        
Childrenâ€™s Cancer & Blood Foundation
Â·        
ARCS â€“ Aids Walk
Â·        
Relay for Life
Â·        
Saint Josephâ€™s School
Â·        
The HUGS Project
Â·        
Wish Upon A Wedding
So what exactly is a JJs Rockin Cupcake? Each one of our cupcakes
is made with the highest quality ingredients and are sourced locally whenever
possible. Preservatives are non-existent in my rockin cupcakes as I freshly
prepare each yummy flavor in small individual batches. Madagascar bourbon
Vanilla extract, Belgian Chocolate & homemade whipped cream are just a few
reasons why your taste buds will dance with happiness! Now here comes the best
partâ€¦.the frostin! My delicate frostinâ€™s have become a major role in my cupcake
success as they are light, flavorful and never overly sweet. It seems like Iâ€™ve
been asked a million times, â€œWill you be bottling your frostin?â€â€¦.only time

What we need
We would use contributions to purchase, fix and update the
vehicle that will bring our freshly baked, customizable cupcakes straight to
you! Our estimated cost for the truck is between $65,000-$70,000 this is what it would include:
Â·        
16-18 Foot Truck
Â·        
6-8 Shelf Convection Oven
Â·        
Gas Burners/Small Stove
Â·        
Microwave
Â·        
Double Door Refrigerator

1 Reservoir tank for used water
Â·        
Generator 
Â·        
2 Service Windows

<p><strong>About Our Business</strong></p>
<p> The Rose &amp; Crown is not your ""downtown"" hookah lounge.  It is our hope that the Rose &amp; Crown will fill a much needed niche in our college town.  Our business aims to provide a relaxing and alcohol-free environment for our clientele.  Once open the Rose &amp; Crown will have more of a resemblance to that of your favorite coffee or tea shop.  Providing our customers with an inviting and comfortable atmosphere is our top priority.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the Owner.</strong></p>
<p>  My name is Robert Christian, and as the owner of the Rose &amp; Crown Hookah Lounge I feel it is my duty to provide you with more information about myself as well as my business.  I moved to Williamsburg, Virginia in 2007 to pursue my dream of becoming a Historic Interpreter in the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.  To my dismay I found that the Williamsburg area, even with such a diverse population, offered no form of entertainment or social interactions than those revolving around bars.  Having attended a college near Athens, Ohio, I had been exposed to various hookah lounges and the wonderful social interactions within them.  The common theme between these establishments had been their intimate settings, as well as their lack of alcohol.  </p>
<p>  In 2012, I began to pursue my new dream of opening the first true hookah lounge in the Williamsburg area.  The reason I call this business a ""true"" hookah lounge is that it incorporates hookah traditions that have existed in global history, including America.  A group of colleagues and I began to research the history of hookahs in the New World, and discovered evidence of hookahs being imported, by way of English Trade, into the American Colonies from India to be used not only for personal desire, but for businesses as well.  These American businesses were most often termed as Coffeehouses or Teahouses, which offered much more than their namesake.</p>
<p>Since 2012, I have left the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and have gained Managerial experience in order to better prepare myself to own and operate the lounge.  Armed with new experience, a thorough knowledge of the services and good required, and a love for the traditions that surrounds the hookah, coffee, and tea that will be served, I am ready to open and devote my time to this dream.  </p>
<p> </p>

<h3><strong>This is an initiative to bring awareness to our local business!</strong></h3>
<p>My family recently moved to Elkhart, Indiana (my hometown!) from the San Francisco Bay area. Since we've become part of the Elkhart community we have been greeted by the most amazing people in our new community. These inspiring business owners and managers delight our taste buds with delicious food and bring culture to our town. Two sisters run a little eatery down the street and cook my family authentic mouth watering Filipino food while their mother bounces our baby girl in her arms. We met Paula King, a cheesecake baker, at her booth at a local farmer's market and she always greets us with a big smile and keeps us coming back for her delicious desserts. Nicole Bauman, co-manager of Rise Up Farms, has provided our family with delicious fresh veggies grown from an organic farm in Elkhart. My family has been touched by these women who have big hearts. They have taken the time to get to know my family, and me give us warm hugs when we see them, and made us newcomers feel like part of a great community. They also just happen to own and/or run fantastic businesses. </p>
<p>As an independent female freelance artist, I believe it is important for women to help one another succeed in personal pursuits, dreams and aspirations. I think it is especially important to help other business women succeed in an area that is saturated with manufacturing businesses owned mostly by men. These businesswomen mentioned here are the inspiration for this project and were some of the first people to make my family feel excited about living in the Michiana area.</p>
<p>Moving to Elkhart from Silicon Valley has made apparent a fact that is not at all apparent to city dwelling, wi-fi using, no phone book having people like myself: not every community has such a strong digital footprint as the Bay Area. All of the aforementioned business owners have very little digital presence. How would you find these local treasures? Probably do an Internet search...but nothing comes up. Next, go out and find a phone book, I suppose. Which would be right next to a pay phone...the pay what?</p>
<p>For many people (myself included), the Internet is the main method of finding local businesses and events. As a professional artist and designer, I want to use my skills to help increase Elkhart county's digital footprint by starting with some of the wonderful women we've met in the Elkhart area.</p>
<p>Your contribution helps build the digital presence of Elkhart County and helps enrich Elkhart's culture. Let's assist these caring business owners and ensure that they stay in business by showing that we care. My hope is that this project will blossom into something larger where we can continue to enhance Elkhart County’s digital presence by including more small businesses in the future.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>This project provides funds to pay for the domain space, design and photography for three local businesses to build or upgrade their digital presence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shekinah Asian Grocery and Deli, 305 N. Nappanee St., Elkhart, IN</li>
<li>Rise Up Farms, 22600 SR 120, Elkhart, IN</li>
<li>Maple City Cheesecake, 134 Jefferson, Goshen, IN</li>
</ul><p>I will be designing and updating their websites, creating online branding, adding their businesses to google maps and other mapping sites, create and/or update Facebook pages, add their business on <a href=""http://yelp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">yelp.com</a>, <a href=""http://urbanspoon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">urbanspoon.com</a>, etc. so customers can find these businesses and provide their feedback.

This is an initiative to bring awareness to our local business!
My family recently moved to Elkhart, Indiana (my hometown!) from the San Francisco Bay area. Since we've become part of the Elkhart community we have been greeted by the most amazing people in our new community. These inspiring business owners and managers delight our taste buds with delicious food and bring culture to our town. Two sisters run a little eatery down the street and cook my family authentic mouth watering Filipino food while their mother bounces our baby girl in her arms. We met Paula King, a cheesecake baker, at her booth at a local farmer's market and she always greets us with a big smile and keeps us coming back for her delicious desserts. Nicole Bauman, co-manager of Rise Up Farms, has provided our family with delicious fresh veggies grown from an organic farm in Elkhart. My family has been touched by these women who have big hearts. They have taken the time to get to know my family, and me give us warm hugs when we see them, and made us newcomers feel like part of a great community. They also just happen to own and/or run fantastic businesses. 
As an independent female freelance artist, I believe it is important for women to help one another succeed in personal pursuits, dreams and aspirations. I think it is especially important to help other business women succeed in an area that is saturated with manufacturing businesses owned mostly by men. These businesswomen mentioned here are the inspiration for this project and were some of the first people to make my family feel excited about living in the Michiana area.
Moving to Elkhart from Silicon Valley has made apparent a fact that is not at all apparent to city dwelling, wi-fi using, no phone book having people like myself: not every community has such a strong digital footprint as the Bay Area. All of the aforementioned business owners have very little digital presence. How would you find these local treasures? Probably do an Internet search...but nothing comes up. Next, go out and find a phone book, I suppose. Which would be right next to a pay phone...the pay what?
For many people (myself included), the Internet is the main method of finding local businesses and events. As a professional artist and designer, I want to use my skills to help increase Elkhart county's digital footprint by starting with some of the wonderful women we've met in the Elkhart area.
Your contribution helps build the digital presence of Elkhart County and helps enrich Elkhart's culture. Let's assist these caring business owners and ensure that they stay in business by showing that we care. My hope is that this project will blossom into something larger where we can continue to enhance Elkhart County’s digital presence by including more small businesses in the future.
What We Need & What You Get
This project provides funds to pay for the domain space, design and photography for three local businesses to build or upgrade their digital presence.

Shekinah Asian Grocery and Deli, 305 N. Nappanee St., Elkhart, IN
Rise Up Farms, 22600 SR 120, Elkhart, IN
Maple City Cheesecake, 134 Jefferson, Goshen, IN
I will be designing and updating their websites, creating online branding, adding their businesses to google maps and other mapping sites, create and/or update Facebook pages, add their business on yelp.com, urbanspoon.com, etc. so customers can find these businesses and provide their feedback. I am not trying to get paid for my time but I am trying to give back to our community by increasing awareness of small businesses in our neighborhoods and to do my part to make Elkhart a great place.
My goal is to raise $2,000 to provide these businesses with web hosting for 2-3 years, design work and photography.

<p>Hello! My name is Jessica. Thank you so much for checking out my project! I'm a soon-to-be first time mom trying to make a difference. With the way the economy has been so stagnant and the cost of diapering a newborn through potty-training, I knew there was something I needed to do to help those moms in need.</p>
<p><img alt=""Me In the Office"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n2vVg-vPxsY/T_5CIDAa2MI/AAAAAAAAAE8/QkoyAoVVSb8/s640/Me-In-Office-Edited.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-right: 10px;""/>Not only have I seen the dramatic need for cloth diapers to be accessible to lower income families, but I've also seen the terrible impact disposable diapers have on our environment and the chemicals they expose to our babies.</p>
<p>I need your help to get ONEBUM going. No matter what, I'm determined to make a this a success and help both the environment and those in need of a better solution for caring for their babies.</p>
<p>ONEBUM will bring hundreds of thousands of babies in poverty, the warmth and hygeine they need.</p>
<p>So will you be a part of it?</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Two Problems Solved with ONEBUM</h2>
<h3>THE ENVIRONMENT</h3>
<p>Disposable diapers are made for one-time use. In fact, they are the 3rd largest one-time use item filling up our landfills today. </p>
<p>Also, since there is no other application of the single-use diaper, use of disposable diapers accounts for 100,000 tons of plastic and 800,000 tons of tree pulp waste in the United States alone.</p>
<p>On top of just filling our environment with wasted plastic and paper - we also toxify the environment with collectively ridding our waste in our landfills. It's actually illegal in most states to dump human waste into landfills. The content of used diapers are supposed to be emptied in the toilet before thrown in the trash. Have you ever seen anyone do that? Me either.</p>
<p>Disposable diapers also contain chemicals such as sodium polyacrylate. A chemical banned from tampons for causing toxic shock syndrome. How do you like that seeping into our baby's bums and into our ground water?</p>
<p>And what do we get for all this waste in our public lands? An estimated $350 million dollar bill. This is the rough cost of getting all of America's disposable diapers to the landfills.</p>
<p>Shocking Environmental Statistics</p>
<ul>
<li>Americans are throwing out 5 garbage bags full of diapers every second.</li>
<li>Disposable diapers account for 50% of a household's waste.</li>
<li>Disposable diapers take an average of 400 years to decompose in landfills.</li>
<li>Roughly 90-95% of the 18 billion fece and urine-filled disposable diapers enter the household trash stream and ultimately end up in landfills, creating an immediate public health hazard.</li>
</ul>
<h3>LOW-INCOME ASSISTANCE</h3>
<p><strong>There are Over 4 million Single Moms in Poverty in the United States Alone</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Homeless Mommy and Baby"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-e8dU8-W0-ZE/T_2pqx8jWRI/AAAAAAAAAEo/eVRibnaqwTY/s1050/homeless-woman-baby.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The bottom-line is this. Cloth diapering is 80% cheaper than diapering with disposables. It's the only realistic, long-term solution to help those in poverty keep their babies clean and healthy.</p>
<p>Considering that babies are changed anywhere from 6-15 times a day, it's shocking that no government program offers assistance in diaper purchases for the poor. Both in the United States and around the world, mothers are struggling to adequately care for their baby's hygiene needs.</p>
<p>So why not just give disposable diapers? Well minus the environmental factors we just discussed, there are many other reasons why giving disposable diapers to babies in need just doesn't cut it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Disposable diapers are just that. Disposable. They will be used up quickly with families being left in the situation they were in not long before receiving them.</li>
<li>Disposable diapers cause higher chances of diaper rash and exposure to harmful chemicals. Needy families cannot absorb medical costs or the cost of diaper rash ointment if their babies develop these side effects.</li>
<li>In deeply poverty-stricken areas of the world, landfills aren't out of the way. They are in the backyards of the people that live there. By giving them disposable diapers we are compounding their problem and creating a genuine public health hazard.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what will we do?</p>
<p>Well, while there are many cloth diapering companies out there, none of them have a charitable motivation. With ONEBUM every diaper purchase will be matched with a ONEBUM diaper (or receiving blanket - whichever the area of poverty requires most at the time) donated to a baby in need.</p>
<h2>Where Is the Money Going?</h2>
<p>ONEBUM is dependant on the generous contributors of IndieGoGo to finish launching. So far you know a little about us and lot about why it's important. Need more convincing?</p>
<p>ONEBUM is started by me and my husband Chase. Our full time jobs are marketers - we know how to get customers. And we WILL make ONEBUM a success. Yes, we do have a mentor team. Yes, we do have a business plan. Yes, we do have networking rescources. Yes, we do have a lawyer and accountant. And yes, we are 100% commited to not stopping until we've done our part to change the world.</p>
<p>Our funding goal of $11,000 has been carefully selected. In case you couldn't tell, we don't believe in waste. Every dollar we're asking for has a purpose. So where will the money be going?</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Inventory</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">$8,000 is needed for our start up inventory. This will include the ONEBUM diapers in upwards of 40 different models. It will also include the inventory of other ONEBUM accessories such as diaper liners and inserts (making cloth diapering easier).</p>

Do Good.
The Architecture/Engineering/Construction (AEC) industry has a responsibility to design and construct buildings that reduce or avoid depletion of critical resources like energy, water, and raw materials to prevent environmental degradation. The world’s best AEC firms achieve these goals while creating built environments that are livable, comfortable, safe and productive. Achieving these goals is a key mission around the globe and is most critical in the third world where resources are often scarce.
WHAT DO YOU GET WHEN YOU COMBINE CREATIVITY, TECHNOLOGY AND THE FREE MARKET?   YOU GET THE AECXCHANGE
Finally, there is a place where you can find creative and artistic design solutions combined with the latest innovations in building technology. 
The AECXCHANGE is a clearinghouse for building designs of all shapes and sizes. Our goal is to bring excellent, affordable, sustainable building and structural design to anyone and everyone who needs it around the world.
THERE IS NO PLACE ON THE INTERNET WHERE CAN YOU FIND COMMERCIALARCHITECTURAL DESIGNS FOR IMMEDIATE PURCHASE AND IT’S OUR GOAL TO PROVIDE IT.
 
Help Us Rebuild the Philippines
AECX is committed to doing good by making the world’s best designs available throughout the world. Nowhere is that need greater than in typhoon ravaged Philippines. AECX is committed to helping rebuild the Philippines and with your help we will donate medical, educational, and community care facility designs to qualified charitable organizations. Be a part of the Build Better. Do Good. movement. Donate to AECXCHANGE today and help us Do Good by doing our part to rebuild the Philippines.



AECX has partnered with the American Red Cross to help facilitate the
reconstruction efforts, and has made a commitment to donate $100,000 in
facility designs.AECX's JourneyOver the past two years, AECXCHANGE (AECX) has been developing the only source for purchasing commercial buildings and structures plans online. We created an internet based portal for you to search for buildings of all types that will help to reduce the time required for design and construction. This portal provides architects, developers, local governments, contractors, and prospective land owners around the world a place to begin their vision and serve the millions of people who need safe, sustainable structures in which to live and work. AECX’s vision brings you value, convenience, variety, and quality through its Design Prototype System (DPS).What is the AECX Design Prototype System (DPS)?AECX has created the Design Prototype System as a process to review, acquire, and bring to market the most creative, functional, innovative and sustainable building designs that exist around the globe.AECX FeaturesThe AECX website allows you to search via building type, building size, construction cost and a variety of other factors to bring your facility closer to reality on time and on budget. AECX will make quality and safe development possible in places where it was not available before.Giving BackThe funds garnered from Indiegogo will help us rebuild the Philippines by enabling us to donate medical, educational and community care center design plans to qualified charitable organizations. In addition, your support will facilitate the completion of our Oracle powered e-commerce website allowing us to continue our Do Good mission by helping our customers to Build Better, while providing assistance to those without access to quality facilities designs.  AECX’s DPS plan database is just the beginning of a series of steps toward revolutionizing the Architecture/Engineering/Construction (AEC) industry. AECX will grow the database through a network of volunteers, design professionals and value added brokers worldwide, trained to locate desirable design content for our growing database.Who does AECX benefit?AECX will empower design firms with the opportunity to convert idle, undervalued assets (i.e. building design portfolio) into revenue generating capital assets, introducing a profit center for most architectural firms which have not been realized in the past.AECX benefits the industry from more than a financial perspective. For the first time, designers on a global level have the opportunity to collaborate and improve projects and design concepts which benefits the architectural community on a world-wide scale.Most importantly, AECX provides a promising future for the architectural profession and for young architects and recent graduates.How can you help?Your contribution today makes a real difference in the lives of the Filipino people.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello everyone and thanks for reading.  My name is Richard and I have been a passionate brewer for many years, stemming from my time as a wine maker in Alsace in France (If you love wine and have never tried Alsace white you most at some point it is so good).  However until earlier this year I was stuck working in IT again which is my original profession, nothing like as fun and rewarding as making beer and wine! That was until I was made redundant. Which leads me to this new and exciting part of my life.</p>
<p>I would like to bring my passion for beer making to the high street in a format that is close to the micropub movement but with the added twist of making some of the beer onsite with the help and input from the drinking public. I would naturally look to sell some of the worlds best craft beer along site and who knows perhaps one day the drinking public could have helped in creating award winning beers as well.   In short I want everyone to see and enjoy the art of craft beer making up close and personal and perhaps even take the leap themselves into making their own beer at home, and even beyond.        </p>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello everyone and thanks for reading.  My name is Richard and I have been a passionate brewer for many years, stemming from my time as a wine maker in Alsace in France (If you love wine and have never tried Alsace white you most at some point it is so good).  However until earlier this year I was stuck working in IT again which is my original profession, nothing like as fun and rewarding as making beer and wine! That was until I was made redundant. Which leads me to this new and exciting part of my life.
I would like to bring my passion for beer making to the high street in a format that is close to the micropub movement but with the added twist of making some of the beer onsite with the help and input from the drinking public. I would naturally look to sell some of the worlds best craft beer along site and who knows perhaps one day the drinking public could have helped in creating award winning beers as well.   In short I want everyone to see and enjoy the art of craft beer making up close and personal and perhaps even take the leap themselves into making their own beer at home, and even beyond.        


What We Need & What You Get
To bring this to the high street I need your help.  As we all know the banks are all very busy doing other things apart from leading to us, and I feel my idea being unique in what it offers is best suited to the indiegogo platform. 
So I am asking for £10,000 in funding, this is to cover the rental costs of suitable premises I am looking at something around the £16,000 per year mark, 3 months’ rent as deposit coming in at around £4000.  Around £1000 for stock of drinks from other craft brewers and wineries (you didn’t think I would leave the wine out did you?)  Around £1000 of site works to get the space ready and the same again (£1000) of small brewery parts (luckily most of the brewery is in place in my shed).  £1000 would then be ear marked for brewing ingredients.  This would leave £2000 partly as a backup in the first months of opening and also to cover running costs (Gas, water, electric, business rates and insurance to name but a few) I do not intent on taking a salary until the business is running at a good level.  
So interested in buying in?  Want to know about the perks? I thought so.
Well £10 gets your name on our website on the thankyou page and invite to annual private BBQ
£20 all of the above and your name displayed in the bar on a wall of thanks photo included if you like.
Big jump £500 gets you the naming rights to one of 12 planned special series beers for a minimum of 3 year run, (some restrictions will apply i.e. cannot be a name already used and not offence) plus the BBQ invite and special place on the wall of thanks.
£1000 permanent naming rights to a regular beer and beer label design/input plus all the other perks.  Naming restrictions will still apply. (This beer would also be sold to other outlets)
£2000 Help design, make, name your very own permanent beer and label plus all the other perks Naming restrictions will still apply. (This beer would also be sold to other outlets)
If the £10,000 target is not reached the money raised will go towards the brewing side of the business first and then to other costs accordingly. 


The Impact
The real ale market is growing year on year, new breweries are opening all the time and are one of the great success stories overriding the current financial crisis.

<div>To say that Rodney was born without a silver spoon in his mouth would be an understatement. My name is Future, and I am Rodney's cousin. I was born in the exact location as Rodney. The same hospital and the same apartment complex where we grew up in our younger days. The apartment complex was a section 8 apartment (low rent government subsidized). We even lived in the same building and the same floor.  Our walls and our bedrooms were just six inches apart. Rodney was just born four months after me.  To this day, he says that he is older than me just so he can feel like he has something over me in a playful way.  I've come to the conclusion, over the past few years, that he is my guardian angel.</div>

<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>The Early Years</strong></h2>
<div>First, I have tell you about his hard life, and how he got the name ""The Cat with Nine Lives"". We were born to single mothers with mostly absentee fathers. When Rodney was about two years old, he fell from his second story window onto the concrete sidewalk.  After surviving the fall, he began to sleepwalk and have seizures. Somewhere between ages seven and eight, Rodney had two more traumatic things happen to him. First, his head was slammed between one of those big industrial dumpster lids.  Next, he was run over by a car in the apartment complex parking lot. When Rodney was about eleven years old, he was accidentally shot in the neck by his step father. His step father had the gun in his three quarter boot.  When he sat down to get the gun out of his boot, Rodney walked toward him. He took the gun out, placed it on the dresser, and the gun went off. It turns out that the bullet just missed his jugular vein. When Rodney turned 17, he was in a bad car wreck in which the car flipped over.  And, the car was left completely mangled and totaled. </div>

<div>I thank God that he survived all of these life threatening moments. If he had not survived, I would not have known what a guardian angel he is for me.  I'm sure for others as well. Looking back on our lives together, I realized that he has been there for me every time I've needed him for anything. How many people can you say that someone has never let you down?

<h2>The Fairy Godmother Project (La Hada Madrina Proyecto)</h2>
<h3>I initially planned to do this project around Lake Aititlan, Guatemala, back in March, 2012, but a few weeks before leaving I fell down the stairs and long story short, didn't walk for 6 months.  Now, the Universe has dropped into my lap an opportunity to do this again, with many hands and hearts to help. The International Gathering of the Rainbow Family of Living Light will be in Mexico from December first to January first, and it is the perfect place and time to find philanthropic minded, enthusiastic kids who want to make a difference in the world. Everything happens for a reason, and everything happens in its own season... and I now think thats why I had to wait.  </h3>

<p> </p>
<p>I have a lot of exciting plans, one of which is to reintroduce ""Chaya"", a forgotten staple food of the ancient Maya, which grows for many years, up to 10 feet tall.  It is spinach-like, producing up to 10 lbs of leaves per season with four times the nutrients of spinach. I would like to start community garden projects, utilizing permaculture techniques of 5 layers of growth, with chichen tractors beneath for weeding and fertilization, while also providing offspring and eggs. Tilapia (fast growing fish) ponds could easily and cheaply provide lean protein quickly and prolifically. I originally became interested in the Maya, when the group entity, ""Five"" began to write first person accounts of Mayan life in the late 1600's and their connection with the legendary Starpeople. You can see the resulting books here~  </p>

<h3>The initial funds will be used to secure a building to collect supplies, to grow seeds, and house the soup kitchen.  The hope is to also invest in a large amount of bulk dried foods (corn, beans, rice) for distribution in 5 lb increments. During this initial distribution phase,  a needs assessment will be done in each village for future assistance program implementation and seeds will be germinated to add to the permaculture garden starter packs during phase 2, at which time we hope to have expanded to community gardens and gardening classes for the young.</h3>
<h3>We will also concurrently be running a daily soup kitchen, where immediate needs can be addressed, such as first aid, shoe distribution, and other requests as funding allows.</h3>

<p>The orphanage uses energy efficient light bulbs but their electric bill is very large due to the fact that there is only one meter to all of the buildings and trailers on the property and the electric company charges a higher rate if the monthly usage is high on a meter.  The electric company will not change their method of billing and so it is imperative that the electric system be sorted out and rewired so that their monthly expenses will be reduced.</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to raise $2,000, which would be enough to start the paperwork for the project.  The total amount would be 9,800 to redo the wiring at the HDN property so that there is a meter at each building and trailer.  All the people who live on the HDN property are volunteers and only get room and board for whatever they do to keep this great orphanage running smoothly.</p>
<p>The only perk that I am able to give are heartfelt prayers for your well-being.</p>

<p>My name is Brenna and I am the founder of the Beeyond a Bike <br/>campaign. In 2012 I rode my bicycle across Canada, to New York City, and then over 10,000 kilometers across the continent of Africa.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I thought I was on a really basic journey - <br/>that my inspiration was a love for cycling coupled with a desire <br/>to support and fundraise for an NGO that empowers women and <br/>communities in Uganda. However, once I began riding in Africa, I <br/>very quickly realized that I was being driven by a passion much <br/>deeper than that. Very soon into my journey I realized that it <br/>was about being a woman - an empowered and independant woman - <br/>pushing limits, overcoming obstacles and challenging stereotypes <br/>while riding my bicycle.</p>
<p>When I reached Egypt, just after I had given my bike away, I had <br/>a dream. I woke up the next morning and knew, with utmost <br/>certainty, that my journey had just begun. I needed to return to <br/>Canada and learn absoultely everything I possibly could about <br/>bicycles. Then, I would return to Africa to share the things I <br/>had learned in order to support women and communities to growing <br/>stronger, more efficient, and more empowered by using bicycles.</p>
<p>And so it was:</p>
<h2><strong>BEEYOND A BIKE WAS BORN!</strong></h2>
<p>Beginning in May 2013, I will ride my bicycle from Vancouver, <br/>Canada to Phoenix, Arizona, carrying all of the tools I need for <br/>basic bike maintenance and repair - henceforth dubbed: The <br/>Beeyond a Bike Mobile Shop. Along the route I will visit <br/>community bike shops, schools and other facilities and offer <br/>bicycle presentations and workshops to **vulnerable demographic <br/>groups. These include women, queer, youth and low-income <br/>communities and more about vulnerable demographic is explained <br/>below.</p>
<p><br/>Workshops are free or by donation, and the funds I raise as I <br/>travel throgh North America will purchase tools for a high <br/>school bicycle program in South Africa***. More information <br/>about this group is also below! After approximately 3 months of <br/>cycling in the US, I will fly to Cape Town, South Africa and <br/>then take 6-12 months to bike to Nairobi, Kenya. Through Africa, <br/>I will volunteer my skills and knowledge of bike mechanics with <br/>already-operating bicycle organizations and run several <br/>independant Beeyond a Bike workshops in other communities along <br/>the way. Places I will visit and teach include Fisantekraal High <br/>School in South Africa, Zambikes in Zambia and women in the <br/>community of Arusha, Tanzania.</p>
<p>In order to make this all possible, I need your help! Please <br/>donate today - $1, $5, $20 ... everything helps - so that I can <br/>establish the Beeyond a Bike Mobile Shop and be capable of <br/>sharing my skills and knowledge as I travel across the US and <br/>Africa. I thank you in advance for your kindness and generosity.</p>
<p>Beeyond A Bike is about more than just pushing pedals; It's <br/>about empowering people. It's about more than changing gears; <br/>It's about changing the world: One community at a time.</p>
<p><br/>**'Vulnerable demograpics' describes categories of people who:</p>
<p>1) Are under-represented in the bicycle community;<br/>2) Have or feel like they have limited to no access to bicycles <br/>and/or knowledge surrounding bicycle mechanics, and/or;<br/>3) Have the potential to greatly impact their communities and <br/>improve their quality of life when able to access a bicycle and <br/>resources/education related to bicycles.</p>
<p><br/>*** Fisantekraal is the name of a township approximately 40 km <br/>from Cape Town, South Africa.

<p><strong>Hi, my name is Eric Patrick Thomas. I am a business owner, public speaker, volunteer and advocate. I come from Flint, Michigan. Recently I started a company called EZ Awareness By Design. The company specializes in total custom apparel, signage, and graphic design. Additionally, we have a line of designer clothing with an emphasis on awareness for people with barriers. </strong></p>
<p>I have a particular interest in advocating for people with disabilities because I am also a spinal cord injury survivor. In 1997 I was shot in the third vertebra resulting in paralysis from the neck down. I started speaking to people and advocating in rehab and have since then spoken all over the United States. </p>
<p>My next speaking event will be at the Abilities Expo in Chicago on June 28th, which brings  me to why I am campaigning. By donating you are helping me cover the cost of my trip for my speaking engagement. </p>
<p>Instead of me telling you about my campaign I will show you.  This is a summary of what I will be speaking about at the Chicago Abilities Expo. </p>
<p>2:30pm – 3:30pm<br/> Life After A Serious Injury: Asking the Questions and Finding the Answers<br/><strong><em>Presented by Eric Patrick Thomas, Owner, EZ Awareness by Design</em></strong><br/> After suffering a spinal cord injury or other serious injury people experience panic. You look for a book with all the answers but find it just isn't there. I know because I've been there. I once was like you - newly injured from a gunshot wound. That was 15 years ago and I was desperately searching for answers. But I'm not here to tell you just about my life. At this workshop we'll interact to talk about living life after an injury. Learn that you are not alone and discover where you can find support. We will discuss the experiences and emotions that are common for people with new spinal cord and other serious injuries. We'll talk about how to understand your new body and the new you, how it will change your life and the lives of those around you. Please bring your questions for discussion. Attendees will leave this workshop feeling more empowered and educated, with tips and tools for building friendships and learning how to mentor others facing similar situations.</p>
<p>You can also find this on the abilitiesexpo.com website under Chicago workshops. </p>

<p>In January 2013, the NJVVMF took possession of a 1964 Bell UH-1D, Iroquois helicopter, also known as the Huey. During the Vietnam Era, Bell Helicopter (A Textron Company) produced 16,000 Hueys, 7,000 of these served in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Our Huey, serial # 64-13732, served two tours in Vietnam.  From October 1966 through September 1967, it served with the 116th Assault Helicopter Company, “The Hornets,” at Cu Chi in support of the 25th Infantry Division. It then served with the 118th Assault helicopter Company, “The Thunderbirds,” from November 1968 through February 1970 at Bien Hoa. During its service in Vietnam, our Huey logged more than 3,000 flight hours, saving countless lives and providing daily support for our troops.</p>
<p>After spending more than two decades outside at the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, the Huey is currently under restoration by a crew of veterans. Throughout the spring of 2013, the crew has been hard at work preparing this Huey for display out front of the Vietnam Era Museum &amp; Educational Center.  Our restoration crew has logged more than 1,500 hours so far.</p>

<p>There are very few risks involved with this project. Thanks to the generosity of our Restoration Crew, members of our local military community and friends of the Foundation, we have already accomplished a great deal. Our Restoration team is already hard at work independent of our fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>The challenge we face is raising the funds to construct the display foundation and plaza by the end of 2013. We are also relying on your support to raise funds to develop and install an interactive museum experience so that all visitors can experience the inside of a Huey.</p>
<p>We already have commitments from the people and organizations needed to complete these parts of the project, so once funds are raised, we can continue to move ahead. Please support our unique and important project!</p>

Equally passionate about healing, </b>each couple experienced a variety of environments and partnerships in their search for the highest quality care for their clientele. Fast forward to 2013. After a series of unusual events, the couples met and found a resonance between them. The idea of creating an integrative health center together was born. They came together with the common purpose of providing whole person 
health care that empowers the individual to achieve optimal health. Plans were put in place to form a partnership and the perfect name was chosen: <b><i>Health Etc. </i>- <i>Health Care for the Whole Person</i>. </b><br/><br/><b>Here's the situation now:</b><br/><p><b>We are currently moving into a new
building</b> in order to house our practices in one convenient, attractive location
for Winters residents and the surrounding communities. Dr. Davis's previous
location (which was very old and rundown) provided much of the furnishings that
are used in a medical office. As a result, we find ourselves <b>needing to
pay out-of-pocket for furniture and equipment </b>at the new place/address/space. </p><p><b>We
also have numerous expenses</b> related to<span>getting this new business venture off the
ground, including<b> IT support, staff salaries (receptionist, physician's
assistant, bookkeeper, office manager) and marketing costs (website design,
networking, display materials, etc.) </b>The list continues to grow yet our
budget remains limited.</span></p>Ultimately, we want to create a center that
promotes health and wellness -- an office environment that is comfortable and
welcoming –– and we’d like to avoid breaking the bank to do it. Think simple
vs. swanky . . . calm vs. chaotic.<p><b><br/></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/348613/files/20140204102356-PB250003_cropped_pr.jpg?1391538236"" src="""" style=""width: 337.399px; height: 157px;""/></p><p></p><p><b>Who We Are:</b><br/></p><p><b>William B.

keeping patients out of the Emergency Room and hospital by working in
partnership with patients to improve and maintain health. He is known for being
accessible to his patients when they need him. Dr. Davis is well-loved by the local community.<br/></p><p>

approach that actually results in working with people in a down-to-earth and
practical manner. It starts with listening, and appreciating the unique person
who is sitting with her and quickly progresses to actively searching with the
patient and provider for something that will help today.

Equally passionate about healing, each couple experienced a variety of environments and partnerships in their search for the highest quality care for their clientele. Fast forward to 2013. After a series of unusual events, the couples met and found a resonance between them. The idea of creating an integrative health center together was born. They came together with the common purpose of providing whole person 
health care that empowers the individual to achieve optimal health. Plans were put in place to form a partnership and the perfect name was chosen: Health Etc. - Health Care for the Whole Person. Here's the situation now:We are currently moving into a new
building in order to house our practices in one convenient, attractive location
for Winters residents and the surrounding communities. Dr. Davis's previous
location (which was very old and rundown) provided much of the furnishings that
are used in a medical office. As a result, we find ourselves needing to
pay out-of-pocket for furniture and equipment at the new place/address/space. We
also have numerous expenses related togetting this new business venture off the
ground, including IT support, staff salaries (receptionist, physician's
assistant, bookkeeper, office manager) and marketing costs (website design,
networking, display materials, etc.) The list continues to grow yet our
budget remains limited.Ultimately, we want to create a center that
promotes health and wellness -- an office environment that is comfortable and
welcoming –– and we’d like to avoid breaking the bank to do it. Think simple
vs. swanky . . . calm vs. chaotic.Who We Are:William B. Davis MD is
a nationally recognized family physician who has practiced medicine in Winters, California
for more than 25 years. Dr. Davis is known for the individualized, thorough
care he gives the patients with whom he works. He stresses the importance of
keeping patients out of the Emergency Room and hospital by working in
partnership with patients to improve and maintain health. He is known for being
accessible to his patients when they need him. Dr. Davis is well-loved by the local community.
Wendy Walker Davis Ph.D. is a licensed clinical
psychologist who has worked in human services for the past 35
years. She holds a Bachelor’s
Degree in Psychology, a Masters Degree in Public Administration, a Masters
Degree in Psychology and a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology. Wendy’s emphasis is a “whole person”, mind-body-heart
approach that actually results in working with people in a down-to-earth and
practical manner. It starts with listening, and appreciating the unique person
who is sitting with her and quickly progresses to actively searching with the
patient and provider for something that will help today.

and healthy if they learn to replace effort with skill and take the time to
learn those skills. For
more than 25 years, Ofer has taught his students how to gain strength and
balance and increase flexibility and mobility without resorting to pain and
discomfort.He has developed SugiTouch, Sugi Yoga and Sugi Fitness Training Programs. Ofer
is also a certified massage therapist, Reiki Master and Feldenkrais®
practitioner. Co-owner of Sugi Health and Fitness in Pleasant Hill, CA.

with Amy are a
combination of hands-on healing, self-awareness counseling, and recommendations
for creating a healthy lifestyle. She has worked extensively with people coping
with a large variety of health issues, beginning at an outpatient mental health
clinic in 1980. Co-owner of Sugi Health and Fitness in Pleasant Hill, CA.Our plan is to include other health professionals (think chiropractor, acupuncturist, homeopath, herbalist...) as soon as possible.Here's what we need:$15,000 for -

We also hope you'll stay around and support us by having dinner and more!Risks and Challenges?San Francisco is one of the greatest cities in the world to conduct business in and be part of-- however, building codes, permits, and the inspection process can be a bit of a Byzantine labyrinth. Luckily we have an amazing team with experienced architects, permit expediators, furniture builders and brewers all working together. We're working with the best in opening this bar.Luckily we also have experience from our other restaurants and retail stores and have used that experience in this project.This project has been designed within the guidelines and regulations of the City and the County of San Francisco. We are fully confident in our team of professionals to navigate through all necessary measures.Current Status: Construction - Test Brewing!We've about half way through to build out. Our brewers permits and constructions permits are literally about to be issued. Our beer equipment is here and is being test batched. Furniture and construction is on going. Our new glass windows and exterior are going to be installed shortly and our kitchen equipment is here sitting in our warehouse ready to be installed following sound proofing and dry wall repair. We're already test brewing on equipment and have been giving out samples and brew lessons at BlackSandsbeer.com. We're exited about where we are and will be posting updates of progress here and on our social media accounts! As for the mobile app: we have a prototype running and are testing out the final bugs! Everything is set for a summer 2014 launch! Questions?Learn more about our operation, see pictures and updates at BlackSandsbeer.comOn Twitter @BlackSandsBeerTo stay up-to-date with our campaign, please follow us! Please also tell all your friends and have them tell all their friends! And if you are press or have a blog feel free to link to this page or use anything from our site! You can also call us with questions or email us!FAQ- Why only 1 perk?We think the Beer for Life program is an awesome deal! With most beers selling for 5 to 8 dollars, this is literally the deal of a lifetime! No one needs more t-shirts, and stickers will be free on site!- What is your capacity like?We have an American Made 9 Barrel Brew Capacity System. This enables us to ferment 9 barrels of beer at a time. We'll usually have 3 to 4 beers of our creation on tap plus more in bottles. We have our wholesale accounts for quick delivery of our grains, yeast and hops, and many are local! If things get busy we can run our brew system up to 3 times a week and keg. We also have plenty of brewing supplies and ingredients for sale in our retail shop for you to brew your own beer!- Does the Beer For Life program expire?Nope. If you are a supporter - its forever. Unless we close as a business. We're going to support you and you'll be able to redeem beers on location forever.- Do beers need to be consumed on site?Yes, pints will be served on site and must be consumed on site - this is the law in California.- You guys will have a full bar right? Can I upgrade to other types of drinks?The beer for life program only supports beer made by Black Sands. While we will serve other beers and spirits you cannot use the program for anything but our house made beer! - What about Food?We invite you to enjoy our restaurant with local food options made with fresh ingredients. Small pub food.- Do we brew any non-alcoholic Beers?Currently all our beers have alcohol. If this changes we'll invite you to participate in our non alcoholic beers too!- What about Tips?Tips are not included in the beer for life program. We invite you to support bar tenders and waiters with the customary American tip for drinks. Usually a $1 or $2 per beer is more than enough.  The tip goes directly to the bar tender and not to Black Sands.- Can I share my Beer For Life Program with Friends?We love that you want to bring friends to Black Sands, but supporters can only claim the free monthly pint for themselves. Supporter logins are tied to their individual name but please do invite your friends to also participate! - I missed a month? Do I get to drink 2 beers the next?Our beer program does not bank. You'll have plenty of time to drink our beers and the application will send you reminders when your free beer is available.- Do I have to live in San Francisco to enjoy this program? Nope - we invite supporters from around the world. Try our beers during visits or know that your support is enabling high quality beers to be enjoyed by many!- What about the iPhone App? Is Android and Windows Phone supported too? Yes - we support all major mobile platforms. There is a native iOS client for iPhones and mobile web version for non iOS supporters. Depending on demand we will port the app to other platforms.- What other entitlements does the program entail?We love our supporters - Black Sands Beer for Life members will also be invited to special events, early tastings, classes, discount programs and other rewards! Drink Responsibly!See Black Sands Terms and Conditions @ http://www.blacksandsbeer.com/termsMore information @ http://www.blacksandsbeer.com",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Feel Good About Our Products:</strong></h2>
<p>We source our coffee from Crop to Cup, and serve only the best fair-trade coffee from Buginyanya, Uganda.   Our coffee comes from small farms and small-scale processors grown by family farms near the Kenya-Uganda border.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Mojo Express is about more than just tasty coffee and treats.  It’s about making our community stronger. </p>
<p><br/>In 2006, I was diagnosed with Lupus, a long-term auto-immune disease.  Naturally, I freaked out.  So I started looking for support groups.  I found that the westside of Chicago did not have any support groups.  So I took matters into my own hands, did my own research with the help of my doctor. With the Lupus Foundation, I became a support group leader on the westside.<br/><br/></p>
<p>Through my work with the Lupus community, I learned that many people with Lupus have a hard time keeping jobs because of Lupus flare-ups and constant doctor’s visits. </p>
<p>I want to give back to this community that has given me so much support by hiring those battling Lupus. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Our Goals:</strong></h2>
<p>$35,000 will make sure the awesome space has all the equipment it needs to succeed.  Coffee makers and grinders to brew you the best.  Espresso machines so we can share our tasty java creations.  A juicer to make sure you’re looking and feeling fresh.</p>

<h3>A little bit about us</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.campusbookstar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CampusBookStar.com</a> launched in the summer of 2012 and is already on track to being the #1 resource for everything college. Our <strong>textbook classifieds</strong> allow students to buy and sell their college textbooks to/from each other in order to save money as buyers, and get more as sellers -<em> a perfect circle and a complete win-win for both parties.</em></p>
<p>But why stop there though? Soon after launching our textbook classifieds we realized there was so much more we could do! That's when we decided to launch a whole new addition to the website -- a full blown <strong>""general classifieds""</strong> that allows students to find housing (on or off campus), dorm/apartment furniture and furnishings, carpools, scholarships, even jobs and internships (pre and post graduation), and SO much more!</p>
<p>The website started as a school project idea, but once the idea was presented we immediately knew that this could be turned into something MUCH bigger! </p>
<p>We decided to make the website <strong>FREE of charge</strong> in order to make it a greater benefit to its users... college students who already are strapped for cash. As college students ourselves, coming up with the original money to create the website was tough. We scraped our own savings accounts and had the site created... what an adventure it's been so far! </p>
<p>  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why do we need help and what can you do</h3>
<p>Well, we are college students trying to build a website that will save millions of college students time and money, help them find jobs and scholarships that can change their lives forever, etc. With that comes a price, and unfortunately we can't do it by ourselves anymore! We hate to have it come down to this, but we need help! </p>
<p>Where the funding will be going:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recuperating loss from the original <strong>and</strong> add-on addition to the website</li>
<li>Web hosting fees (you can't imagine the cost of maintaining a website as large as ours)</li>
<li>New servers to help keep the website quick and nimble!</li>
<li>Advertising, marketing, and promotional efforts that have been lacking due to current insufficient funds</li>
<li>Add an ""eTextbook"" purchasing section on the website (for students who prefer digital copies of books)</li>
<li>A scholarship of our own that will be awarded to exceptional students who go above and beyond their academic responsibilities</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest, our current goal of just $40,000 would put us just about financially even. We chose this number because it's honestly what's needed to really get this website off and running. Any more than our goal would allow us to rent an actual office (instead of working out of bedrooms), expand the brand to overseas (so that all students around the world could use our site), and maybe just maybe finally pay off some of our employees :) </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks?</h3>
<p>You betcha! Take a look at the right hand side of the screen for a list of all of our perks (they are REALLLLLLY cool!!!!). More importantly though, this campaign is about the students who our website helps. Therefore, keep in mind that as you are selecting a perk, that the absoulte most import thing you are gaining from your donation is knowing that you are truly helping college students by helping our cause!</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>We took a huge risk using money out of our pockets to create this site, but we know how great of a resource it already is and can continue to be as it grows. We just need a little bit of help from everyone here!</p>
<p>Your donation helps the users of our website save money on textbooks, find housing, get jobs &amp; internships, find scholarships and SOOOO much more.</p>
<p>We sincerely thank you for your donation and we're sure the other 18.2 million college students who can use our site do as well! </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand if you can't financially contribute to our cause, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:</p>
<ul>
<li>We'd really appreciate it if you could let your friends and family know about us. The more people/students who know about and use <a href=""http://www.campusbookstar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CampusBookStar.com</a>, the better the chance we all have at being successful! </li>
<li>""Like"" us on Facebook - <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/CampusBookStar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/CampusBookStar</a> and follow us on twitter - @CampusBookStar -- We would really appreciate it. Tell everyone you know to do so as well! </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>--------</p>
<p><strong>In all seriousness though, we want our website to become successful simply so that we can touch the lives and help millions of college students every year... But we can't do so without a little help from you first. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you so very much for looking and for donating - it truly means the world to us! </strong></p>

New servers to help keep the website quick and nimble!
Advertising, marketing, and promotional efforts that have been lacking due to current insufficient funds
Add an ""eTextbook"" purchasing section on the website (for students who prefer digital copies of books)
A scholarship of our own that will be awarded to exceptional students who go above and beyond their academic responsibilities

To be honest, our current goal of just $40,000 would put us just about financially even. We chose this number because it's honestly what's needed to really get this website off and running. Any more than our goal would allow us to rent an actual office (instead of working out of bedrooms), expand the brand to overseas (so that all students around the world could use our site), and maybe just maybe finally pay off some of our employees :) 
 
Perks?
You betcha! Take a look at the right hand side of the screen for a list of all of our perks (they are REALLLLLLY cool!!!!). More importantly though, this campaign is about the students who our website helps. Therefore, keep in mind that as you are selecting a perk, that the absoulte most import thing you are gaining from your donation is knowing that you are truly helping college students by helping our cause!
------
We took a huge risk using money out of our pockets to create this site, but we know how great of a resource it already is and can continue to be as it grows. We just need a little bit of help from everyone here!
Your donation helps the users of our website save money on textbooks, find housing, get jobs & internships, find scholarships and SOOOO much more.
We sincerely thank you for your donation and we're sure the other 18.2 million college students who can use our site do as well! 
 


Other Ways You Can Help
We understand if you can't financially contribute to our cause, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:

We'd really appreciate it if you could let your friends and family know about us. The more people/students who know about and use CampusBookStar.com, the better the chance we all have at being successful! 
""Like"" us on Facebook - www.facebook.com/CampusBookStar and follow us on twitter - @CampusBookStar -- We would really appreciate it. Tell everyone you know to do so as well! 


--------
In all seriousness though, we want our website to become successful simply so that we can touch the lives and help millions of college students every year... But we can't do so without a little help from you first. 
Thank you so very much for looking and for donating - it truly means the world to us!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Missy Kennett took a leap of faith in opening Cafe M after running an order-based treat business, Treats By Missy, for almost a year with much success.  In March 2013, in order to accommodate her growing business, she opened the doors to a quaint Cafe in the heart of Norfolk.  Here she showcases her pastries and passion through breakfast, lunch, and outside orders. </p>
</div>
<div>Putting 80+ hours a week in, often times working solo on 15-18 hour shifts, Missy needs YOUR help to keep the momentum going and provide a better experience for those who support her, and her growing customer base.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
Deciding to be modest in the amount being asked, Missy is looking to provide the basics to better her Cafe.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You've asked for it - help us get it! </div>
<div>Espresso Machine (one that doesn't leak and break daily) <strong>$2000</strong>
</div>
<div>(We are opting for a smaller, less-expensive model that will do the job - but hoping to get a super deluxe edition that does everything!)  Fall is coming - and you need your lattes!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Furniture/misc. kitchen items - <strong>$3500</strong>
</div>
<div>If you're tired of looking at our faded black table cloths and sitting on hard wood chairs, help us grab a few comfy chairs and even some pans to do the baked vegan/healthy donuts you've been asking us for!  We also want to give you a better pastry view - help us grab up a new pastry case to accommodate more delights!</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Working Capital - <strong>$2000</strong>
</div>
<div>Yes this sounds low, but Missy put every penny she had into being able to get the shop up and running and now she needs help running it!  She's currently in talks with a local culinary institute to give paid training/experience to an eager-to-learn student, so that she can fill that pastry case with all of the delights she can't do while making eggs (and bacon, and sandwiches, and coffee, and...well...you get the point.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>Many of you may be unaware but our Cafe is located smack dab in the middle of an awesome non-profit organization building.  Eggleston Services provides training, support, education and employment opportunities to persons with disabilities.  Eggleston is helping to change the lifestyle of those who may not have opportunities otherwise, by encouraging them to be independent as much as possible, and give them satisfaction of being able to grow as individuals financially and socially.  Our monthly rent goes directly to this organization and we interact with these individuals on a daily basis by providing them with low-cost snacks and beverages that they enjoy.  We pride ourselves in offering these individuals products that we do not profit off of, and also offering a discount to the hard-working staff that keep these individuals educated and happy on a daily basis.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are also very eager to be able to hire a determined, excited culinary student - and hope to become a good partner for the institute.  Starting a small business is hard - especially when you wear all the hats.  We want to share this experience and help train the future chefs/small business owners of the world!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cafe M is proud to support local vendors - whether it be bottled Kombuchick teas, or produce from farms in VA - and we want to help their businesses thrive along with ours.  Your contribution will not only help our little cafe grow with success, you will also directly be contributing to the growth of other small businesses and non-profit organizations in the community.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
We understand that all of you may not be able to financially contribute - but maybe you know someone that can!  Spreading the word via social media - or even snail mail - we appreciate all word of mouth!  Bring a friend for lunch or pick up a 2 pack of donuts (for just $2) and share with someone who has never been to our Cafe.  It all counts - and matters more than you can ever know!</div></span></span></div>","Short Summary

How are doing this? Well we're helping people like so;<br/>- Students/Workers lacking social confidence.<br/>- Students/Workers going away and in need of contact, updates or notes.<br/>- Students/Workers that don’t have the ability to be socially active.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Comleak.com gives users the opportunity to have their own small website/blog + store within the website its self. Customizing their page and having future opportunity to earn money from this.</p>
<p>The Blog style profile is to enable easier viewing and searching of a user’s profile.

They are given their own url based on their blog page name (Customization).. To share and link through school, work and even too friends. <br/> We wanted to ensure that the page could be used for more than just 1 purpose. We had brain stormed and found this the best possible way to be able to incorporate many styles of networking and education into a website.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples: <br/> Enables Philosophers to merely talk about and educate others on philosophy.<br/> Allows a Fashion designer to show the world their label, and advertise.<br/> A Teacher can get their students writing homework up online for say – History class, maths class, English class.</p>

A group can be named whatever is deemed necessary by the creator and adding and removing people can also be done by an administrator in the group, or it can be an open invite environment. Only leaving the Admin to remove un-wanted people. <br/> - Implementing a system called ""Chalkboard"". Chalkboard is something that allows Company’s, Businesses and Schools to post important and relevant dates, times, meetings, class notes or class files to the Top of the page in a large heading format. This can be erased when irrelevant and edited at any time, much like a regular chalkboard! <br/> - Allowing Students to be able to upload work that they've done in hopes for advice or even work that is ready for submitting.<br/> - Allowing Work colleagues to post about upcoming shifts, to swap shifts around easily, to post about workplace changes or information regarding shifts on offer over a certain busy period.<br/> - Allowing ANYONE to be able to upload content regarding group projects or funny photos from work that week.</p>

<p class=""ParaAttribute1""><strong>About This Campaign</strong></p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1"">I am so excited to tell you about the changes at ReNew Organic Skin Care.  After  years of being in Hampden, where I have been providing skin care services and my own line of organic and vegan skin care products , I am moving and expanding my business.  This campaign will help to fund the expansion, which will include a retail store where I will provide a variety of natural and organic personal care items, as well as workspace to make my products.  I am currently making products in my home, which has been a challenge.</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1""><strong>A Community Effort</strong></p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1"">I am very fortunate to have been chosen by the Hamilton-Lauraville Main Street Association as the first business in the incubator project they have created as part of a community redevelopment effort.  I will finally have a retail store and workspace in addition to a treatment room for skin care services… all under one roof.  To go along with the changes, I have changed the name of the business to ReNew Botanicals and redesigned my logo.</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1""><strong>More About Me</strong></p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute2"">For those of you not familiar with me, or ReNew, I am a master esthetician and aromatherapist.  I have been practicing skin care for over 21 years.  I have always been interested in helping the planet and helping others to realize that they can make a difference too. </p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute2""><strong>Why Eco-Friendly, Organic Products?</strong></p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute2"">Over the years I became aware of how many skin care products contain toxic ingredients, that is why I decided to develop my own skin care line. </p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute2"">Also, I know firsthand about chemical sensitivities and illnesses related to the environment, because I live with these every day.</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute2"">My concept is to provide the community with safe, affordable, chemical and toxin- free, quality products and skin care services in one beautiful space.   In addition to my own organic and vegan skin care line and baby care line, I will be offering therapeutic and aromatherapy products. There will be also be handcrafted soaps, body butters, hair care and much more from regional artisans, all keeping a low carbon footprint and supporting the local economy. I eventually plan to host classes and lectures here for the community.</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute2""><strong>How Can You Help?</strong></p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute2"">Between equipment and supply purchases, licensing, graphic design and other fees, I need roughly $7,500 to open this new space.  Your contributions will help in purchasing:</p>
<ul>
<li> $2,000 new logo design, label design and sign</li>
<li>$2,500 products and supplies</li>
<li>$2,500 to build a counter and displays</li>
<li>$500 permits, licenses, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""ParaAttribute2"">Any amount you give will help, and please take a look at the gifts you will receive for each donation level.</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute4"">However, even if you cannot donate at this time, you can still help us by passing along this Indiegogo campaign to others who might be interested in my story or this project. Please tell everyone you know!  Please share… Post it to your Facebook wall, Tweet my link, Email your friends. </p>

<p>Are you ready for a web service with some community spirit and the idea that your every trip is a possibility to earn some extra money?</p>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>One night couple of years ago I started to think a friend of mine who was at that time commuting about 120 miles every single day and spending lots and lots of money on that. And that actually we all have more or less regular routes we take either by cars, buses or trains. So basically we all form a huge but unutilized network of couriers which spreads to all communities, cities and countries all over the world.</p>
<p>Then I started to think about all the stuff that we are sending to each other - for example bikes, clothes and computers. We need to send goods to our friends, relatives, customers etc. who might live 10 or 100 miles away. We buy goods from online auction sites and we often need to arrange a delivery for those goods and many times it is hard and expensive to find a reliable and fast transportation method.</p>
<p>So, we have couriers and we have shippers. The only problem has been that they are not aware of each other. But now there is a solution, BoxTakers.com, a free to use web page where both individual people and companies are allowed to advertise their upcoming routes and shipments. Other users can then get advertiser's contact information and either ask or offer a delivery for the goods. The couriers are able to cover their traveling costs and the shippers have an easy and fast way to send goods and save the environment. No extra trips, no extra worries, just extraordinary service and some community spirit.</p>
<p>By using BoxTakers.com you have a possibility to start utilizing the courier network we all form and do good for yourself, your community and the environment.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Current situation and Your help?</h3>
<p>The web page is already available at <a href=""http://www.boxtakers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.boxtakers.com</a> and now we need to start active marketing to raise awareness of this site and attract more users. Our job is now to advertise BoxTakers.com to make sure that your ads in BoxTakers.com would get as much viewers as possible and you would be able to cover your traveling costs or arrange a delivery to your shipment as often as possible. Since the more users this service has the better it works.</p>
<p>Your contribution will be used for advertising BoxTakers.com. The contribution you give us will come straight back to you as the more users we have the more you have goods to deliver and deliveries to your shipments. This is your possibility to join building the future network which allows you to benefit from your own and other users' trips.</p>
<p>The aim is to arrange a targeted online advertising campaign with planned length of 3 months. Advertising will be focused on a few areas with a lot of active users at the time of the advertising start-up. This is to assure that the networks in active areas work on the best possible way and will start to expand when experiences of BoxTakers.com spread. So sign up on BoxTakers.com yourself and invite your friends too, since the more users your community has the more likely it is that your contribution will be used to raise awareness of BoxTakers.com in the area where you live in.</p>
<p>So together we will start to create BoxTakers-networks at a community level with the vision that someday these smaller networks reach each other and we have a global courier network in use.</p>
<p>The campaign can be executed as planned if the funding goal of $15,000 will be reached. If the goal is exceeded we can arrange a longer campaign with more areas included.<img alt=""Shipments"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.boxtakers.com/igg/Shipments.gif"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;"" title=""Find shipments from BoxTakers.com""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Perks?</h3>
<p>It's all about the perks, isn't it? Since you already are able to use BoxTakers.com for free it would be hard to create site related discounts beating that. Thus we created few other perks and also thought to take concrete actions for the environment on behalf of you (see Perk 3).</p>
<p><strong>Perk 1:</strong> We will create a Supporters-list into BoxTakers.com and every contributor will get his/her name to that list either on the Platinum, Gold, Silver or Bronze category as explained on the list of perks.</p>
<p><strong>Perk 2:</strong> A thank you letter to express our gratitude.</p>
<p><strong> <img alt=""Planting a tree"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.boxtakers.com/igg/Plant3.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Planting a tree""/>Perk 3:</strong> Since one idea of BoxTakers.com is to save the environment we thought to add an environmentally friendly offer as this project's main perk. So, for the contributions of $25 and above a specified amount of carbon dioxide will be absorbed from the atmosphere by planting trees via web-based planting community. The trees will be planted to areas where deforestation is a problem so your contribution will prevent the general erosion at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Perk 4: </strong>For contributions of $100 and more you can do a selection; would you rather have some promotional material of BoxTakers.com or a Skype discussion with the founder of BoxTakers.com. If you choose the discussion, the topic is your call (as long as it's within the limits of good taste).</p>
<p>The specifications of each reward will be described better in the list of perks.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>As a friend I have watched the Danlers go through terrible trials over the past month. This is my attempt to make the mountains they still have to climb a bit easier.</p>
<h3><strong>A Little Background</strong></h3>
<p>In 2004 <a href=""http://kirstenuhler.com/?s=tumor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kirsten was diagnosed with a benign pituitary tumor</a>, which was removed surgically through her nose. What remained grew and was removed. It grew again and was removed via craniotomy surgery, followed by radiation therapy in 2010.<br/><br/>A few weeks ago Kirsten started dropping weight, becoming weak, and experienced reduced cognitive function and became occasionally confused. A month or so ago she was at work and became disoriented and was sent to the emergency room. She had dangerously low potassium. After a while she was released. Then she slipped on a stool and cut her shin. When the wound wouldn’t heal, she visited her primary care physician, who was alarmed. After consults and tests she was diagnosed with Type I Diabetes. This has been disruptive.<br/><br/>Kirsten spends all her time trying to count carbs and prepare meals according to her dietitian’s recommendations. She continues to drop weight: a few pounds between each doctor visit. Then, on Friday, she missed an appointment with her endocrinologist who specializes in diabetes, which is very out of character. When I talked to her she told me she became scared while driving due to overwhelming confusion regarding her surroundings. She spoke with her doctor on the phone, who called an ambulance.</p>
<p>Kirsten is the mother of three girls, 9, 11, and 13. She was recently earned her BS in Nursing and was studying for the boards to become an RN when she was diagnosed with Cushing's and diabetes. She is a nursing unit secretary at Maine Medical Center.</p>
<h3><strong>The Current Situation</strong></h3>
<p>Kirsten was admitted to the hospital on August 17 due to symptoms related to Cushing's Syndrome, diabetes, confusion and low weight. While admitted she fell and crushed her C5 vertebrae resulting in paralysis of part of her right arm and emergency surgery. Once she was stablized and doctor's could concentrate on her original set of symptoms they decided to remove her adrenal glands. As a result of this surgery, Kirsten had uncontrollable internal bleeding, which was yet another moment that death was too close for this sweet family. Kirsten is now stable and in a rehabilitation hospital.</p>
<p>On the same day that Kirsten was admitted, her husband, Brent, was cleaning out his office and preparing to start a new job on Monday. He had to delay starting this new job for weeks while he was necessarily involved in Kirsten's rapidly changing situation as an advocate, father, and husband. </p>
<p>Of course, everyday life has been happening too--end of summer camps for the girls, the start of school, etc. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's Next</h3>
<p><span>After a neck fracture, post-surgery intubation, bilateral adrenalectomy, and embolization to stop post-surgery internal bleeding, Kirsten is finally on a very positive trajectory toward recovery. There are still many difficult challenges ahead, and the road to full strength will be long, but progress is quick and Kirsten becomes more independent each day.</span></p>
<p>The Danlers aren't sure what medical costs will be for Kirsten's current treatment nor what she will need ongoing. It's pretty certain that Kirsten will not be working like she was previously and so overall household income will decrease while financial obligations increase. We're setting $5,000 as a modest goal to relieve a little bit of pressure. we hope that much more can be raised.</p>
<p>We're not offerring any perks because this isn't a start-up, it's people's lives in a very serious time. You can know that there is tremendous gratitude from the Danlers for your generosity, and that your support makes a huge financial, emotional, and psychological impact. </p>
<p>Funding will be used at the Danler's discretion towards medical bills, rent, groceries, etc. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Relieving a portion of the burden on the Danler's means that there can be a few more smiles during difficult times. Your contribution, however much, means a lot.</p>

<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.73765500751324"">300 million girls and women are under monthly house arrest because of menstruation. </strong>In most of the world as we know it, menstruation has become a non-issue. We believe it should be that way for women in rural India as well.</p>
<p>At present, these 300 million have no access to female hygiene products such as pads and tampons. While these products are readily available in urban areas, they rarely make their way to villages due to the lack of distribution channels. In the rare cases that they do, most of the demographic in rural India cannot afford them.<br/><br/>Back in February 2011, Ameet and Dhiren found that menstruation was keeping girls out of school. It isn’t uncommon for “becoming a woman,” or the onset of menstruation, to be synonymous with dropping out of school. Meanwhile, women are unable to go to work when they are on their periods. Resourcefulness leads them to fashion homemade alternatives. But compared to what we find in drugstores, these are ineffective and unhygienic.<br/><br/>We have designed 100% biodegradable pads that can be sold 40% cheaper than existing solutions, and a machine that will produce them. <strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.73765500751324""><span>But we need your help to improve this prototype machine so that we can turn our business plan into reality.</span></strong> More efficient machines will enable us to produce at a scale that can make a real impact. When our machine is completed, we will start working with rural communities in India to distribute the machines and begin production.<br/><br/>Our vision is a world where women and girls can have greater freedom to pursue life’s opportunities. Making menstruation a non-issue is one of the stepping stones. With your support, girls can stop missing school and women will be able to support themselves and their families regardless of the time of the month. Be part of the solution.</p>

In most of the world as we know it, menstruation has become a non-issue. We believe it should be that way for women in rural India as well.
At present, these 300 million have no access to female hygiene products such as pads and tampons. While these products are readily available in urban areas, they rarely make their way to villages due to the lack of distribution channels. In the rare cases that they do, most of the demographic in rural India cannot afford them.Back in February 2011, Ameet and Dhiren found that menstruation was keeping girls out of school. It isn’t uncommon for “becoming a woman,” or the onset of menstruation, to be synonymous with dropping out of school. Meanwhile, women are unable to go to work when they are on their periods. Resourcefulness leads them to fashion homemade alternatives. But compared to what we find in drugstores, these are ineffective and unhygienic.We have designed 100% biodegradable pads that can be sold 40% cheaper than existing solutions, and a machine that will produce them. But we need your help to improve this prototype machine so that we can turn our business plan into reality. More efficient machines will enable us to produce at a scale that can make a real impact. When our machine is completed, we will start working with rural communities in India to distribute the machines and begin production.Our vision is a world where women and girls can have greater freedom to pursue life’s opportunities. Making menstruation a non-issue is one of the stepping stones. With your support, girls can stop missing school and women will be able to support themselves and their families regardless of the time of the month. Be part of the solution.
 

All the funds we raise will go towards research and development for our machine or to other immediate needs to operationalize our business, such as building out our distribution network [of female entrepreneurs]. Raising our goal of $65,000 through this campaign will keep us on track with our timeline for operations in 2013.
We will keep you updated as to how we allocate our funds as we operationalize our business.

<p>There is a law that protects soldiers from being served custody papers from the other party while they are deployed but THERE IS NO LAW protecting them once they hit the ground in the U.S. She had a care plan set up for the fathers to take the children while she was deployed and then custody was to be returned once she returned home. They didn't give the kids back.  Not only did they not give the kids back but they didn't even bring the kids to welcome her home when she returned..</p>
<p>Anyone that knows her knows that this whole thing is outrageous however the fathers have a good chance of winning because the children have been living with their fathers for a year BECAUSE SHE WAS DEPLOYED!! She just wants her kids back and her life back the way it was before she deployed... but now needs a good lawyer to help her fight! She fought for us while deployed, now lets fight for her!

<h3 style=""margin-left: 120px;""><strong>This is her story in her words:</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong><span class=""notranlsate"">When I found out I was being deployed, I arranged for my children to stay with their fathers until I returned. I have two girls (9 and 7) with my ex-husband in NY where I'm from and a son (4) with my ex-boyfriend in NJ. At the time I had a very civil relationship with my ex-husband, and an excellent relationship with my son's father. Although he lived in NJ, he visited my son as often as he could, making a 5 hour drive up about every other weekend. He stayed at my house, ate my food and spent time with my girls and I. When I found out that I was deploying to Afghanistan, I made the arrangements for the children to stay with their dads and left with confidence that I would get them when I returned. Due to my divorce, I had full custody of my girls with shared legal. I had a military family care plan done to ensure that they would be taken care of while I was away. With my son, it was a little more complicated. Due to the fact that we were never married I never had legal paperwork done. He just always lived with me. When I was 5 months pregnant, his father left me and decided he didn't want to have anything to do with him. After he was born I contacted him to tell him if he didn't want to be in his life than to sign his rights away to me. So he sent me a signed paper stating he didn't want to be in his life and didn't want any responsibility, financial or otherwise, of my son. So I filed a petition in court, but after giving it more thought, I was upset and sad that my son wouldn't have a father. So I contacted him again, asking him to reconsider and to just meet him, knowing he would change his mind. So he did, and he did. From that point on, we once again became close and he was always a wonderful father. While I was deployed I web-cammed with the kids as much as they would allow and I was able to. When I returned to the states I received an email from both of them stating that they were filing for custody and I wasn't allowed to pick them up. There was never any indication that they were planning this together, and to this day, I don't know why. I was completely blind-sided by the whole thing. I received many offers to help, but nobody has followed through. I went to both initial court hearings alone, without a lawyer, and lost temporary custody of them all due to the fact that ""they had a year long routine already"". I can't afford a lawyer because the money I saved was to set a house back up when I returned. I have spent a good bit of it driving back and forth to NJ from Upstate NY, and I'm mentally, emotionally physically and financially exhausted. I can't believe in my country, the country I love and serve, this can happen. I've lost faith in people, and don't know where to turn. I have spent days on end trying to find someone who will help me. I still have no help. It comes down to money an how much I can offer. I just don't have it. I missed my children for that year I was away more than you'll ever know, and am missing them terribly more so now that they are within reach, and I still can't hold them. They are, and always have been, everything to me.</span></p></div>","Welcome Home..where's my kids?

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;""><strong>The Universe is in a constant state of expansion and it doesn't cost a dime.  Open Door Yoga is expanding and, well, it's costing a bit more.  An organically growing and prosperous business doesn't sound like much of a problem to most people, right?  Well, here's the thing:  Our need to expand into a larger space has simply grown faster than our capital has to be able to fund the next phase of our development.  Here's our story...</strong></span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;""><strong>About ODY</strong><br/>Open Door Yoga, located in Raleigh, NC, is a hot Hatha yoga studio dedicated to providing a comfortable, judgement-free space for people of all backgrounds, body types, personalities and lifestyles to feel welcomed and supported while practicing yoga.  In addition to the many newcomers and first-timers we get regularly, we have also attracted a diverse crowd of regular practitioners who enjoy the improved quality of life and general well-being they receive from the physical, mental and medical benefits of a regular yoga practice.  </span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">My name is Monica Shannon.  I am the founder of Open Door Yoga.  I began teaching yoga over 10 years ago.  It has been my fulltime life's passion and by now, I am pretty darn good at it!  When I opened Open Door, one of my main goals was to make sure ANYONE who wanted to practice yoga, could do so.  When I was new to yoga, I had to clean the studio I practiced at in order to afford taking classes.  I really wanted to create a studio that was accessible in more than one way.  Within two years of opening, I was able to switch to a completely donation based system.  We simply leave a jar on our fron</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">t desk and folks pay what they can. </span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">Many folks are skeptical of the donation </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">system.  But over the years I have seen that even though some folks pay only a few bucks for a class and some pay as much as $15, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">it all balances out.  The average </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">donation is consistently around $10 per class.  I receive emails weekly from folks who are very appreciative...the donation system is the only reason they are able to afford a daily practice.  And, many of them feel their practice is what keeps their lives moving forward</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">.  </span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">In the last few years we have continued to grow faster than I could have ever imagined!   As we wer</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">e turning folks away from full class rooms, I could see the writing on the wall:  Grow or die!  </span></p>
<p><br/><img alt=""People"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.opendooryogastudio.com/images/collagepeople3.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Growing Community""/></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">But our current space only</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;""> allows for a limited amount of people</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">...and so our income potential is also limited.  Raising capital has been slow.  <br/><br/></span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">By the spring of 2012 I had managed to save around $20,000.  I had a small credit line, some credit cards and promises from my family to help if needed.  I felt prepared.  Ha!</span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">I began the actual expansion project when the space next door became available.  Demolition and design began almost immediately.  Everything seemed very do-able.  By all accounts it seem</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">ed like a simple project.  But, then my HVAC contractor called me up one day and informed me that the ventilation requirements based on the number of people we could fit in the new room were different than he and the engineer had anticipated.  I was now going to have to purchase a $63,000 piece of machinery that is basically a fancy Energy Recovery Unit (ERV).  Paired with the radiant heat panels...this is our heating system.  The heat is the core of our business...it's one of the reasons why people come to us.  I was already in ankle deep and the waters of change were quickly rising. </span></p>

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">So, I acquired some money from my super supportive family members and have been able to keep it going.  So far, I have used my savings in addition to the contribution from my family to pay for the demolition, insulation, new sub floor, the extra bathroom, mirrors, yoga floor and the hole in the wall that will connect the new space to the old space.  But, soon, I will need more help to get it finished.  I still have quite a bit of electrical work to do in addition to paying for the giant ""ERV.

Many folks are skeptical of the donation system.  But over the years I have seen that even though some folks pay only a few bucks for a class and some pay as much as $15, it all balances out.  The average donation is consistently around $10 per class.  I receive emails weekly from folks who are very appreciative...the donation system is the only reason they are able to afford a daily practice.  And, many of them feel their practice is what keeps their lives moving forward.  
In the last few years we have continued to grow faster than I could have ever imagined!   As we were turning folks away from full class rooms, I could see the writing on the wall:  Grow or die!  

But our current space only allows for a limited amount of people...and so our income potential is also limited.  Raising capital has been slow.  By the spring of 2012 I had managed to save around $20,000.  I had a small credit line, some credit cards and promises from my family to help if needed.  I felt prepared.  Ha!
I began the actual expansion project when the space next door became available.  Demolition and design began almost immediately.  Everything seemed very do-able.  By all accounts it seemed like a simple project.  But, then my HVAC contractor called me up one day and informed me that the ventilation requirements based on the number of people we could fit in the new room were different than he and the engineer had anticipated.  I was now going to have to purchase a $63,000 piece of machinery that is basically a fancy Energy Recovery Unit (ERV).  Paired with the radiant heat panels...this is our heating system.  The heat is the core of our business...it's one of the reasons why people come to us.  I was already in ankle deep and the waters of change were quickly rising. 

So, I acquired some money from my super supportive family members and have been able to keep it going.  So far, I have used my savings in addition to the contribution from my family to pay for the demolition, insulation, new sub floor, the extra bathroom, mirrors, yoga floor and the hole in the wall that will connect the new space to the old space.  But, soon, I will need more help to get it finished.  I still have quite a bit of electrical work to do in addition to paying for the giant ""ERV. "" As a contributor to this project you will be supporting the continuation of community-based yoga studio that has been a stepping stone for SO MUCH positive change in peoples lives.  Open Door is the type of place where people come to literally change their lives:  To get their health in control, to grieve losses, to figure out that next step or to simply learn to love themselves.  It is the type of place where grandmothers come with their grandchildren and where I sometimes see opposing local politicians  practicing in the same class.  We are a community where people do things everyday that they never knew they could do.  
If you believe in empowering your community by helping people learn to care for themselves; if you believe in family owned and operated small business, then Open Door is the type of place you can feel happy to support.  Below you will see an explanation of how the money will be used.  And below that you will see the description of our incentives.

No amount of money is too little or too big.  Please help by contributing any amount you can and/or passing this on to your family and friends. 

The industrious ""sharer"" who leads to the highest level of contributions will win One Year of FREE YOGA!  So share on! Share with your friends and family, co-workers and neighbors.  Just please make sure you are looged in to Indiegogo before you share...it's the only way to have your shares and resulting contributions tracked! 

Thank you so much for reading this.  I, we, Open Door appreciates every effort to help us to continue to grow and serve our community.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<strong>KidWideWeb - Revolutionizing the way Children Experience the </strong>Web</h2>

<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>What Options Do Parents Have?</strong></h3>
<p>Parents should talk openly and often to their kids about their internet use, about both the benefits and its pitfalls.  Parents should personally monitor their children's internet use and history at least once a week, if not more.  And parents should attempt to control their children's internet use by installing some kind of internet security software or parental controls.  The problem is that despite parents' best efforts, their diligence is often thwarted by the use of substandard internet security products and parental controls that use ineffective and often outdated filtering technologies.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>MORE ABOUT THE PROBLEM</h3>
<p>Since the internet does not have a ratings system for its sites, like with motion pictures, the question becomes: from predators to porn to cyber-bullying, as parents and responsible adults, how do we deal with our children’s unfettered access to the internet?  So far, no internet security technology has adequately addressed these very serious problems. There is no internet program that differentiates the age of the internet user and that does not make sense because a 6yr old sees the world very differently than a 9yr old, and a 9yr old sees it much different than a 12yr old, so they shouldn't have the same internet access.  And that is why we have developed the KidWideWeb.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></h3>
<h4>Our mission is to give our children the opportunity to experience all of the benefits and wonderment of the internet, in an age-appropriate environment, while shielding our children from dangerous, inappropriate content and communications.</h4>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>THE KIDWIDEWEB</strong></h3>
<p>The KidWideWeb, several years in the making, is an application that provides safe, age appropriate Internet access to children while shielding them from all malicious content and communications.  To achieve this goal, KWW is backed by a team of educators, technology experts, and concerned parents who have spent countless hours working to make this vision a reality.  KWW is now working with IDEAS of Orlando, a former division of Disney Studios and also the University of Central Florida(UCF) as part of their award-winning Business Development Program.  </p>
<p><img alt=""UCF Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8294/7699260996_728f61afe3_m.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""UCF Logo""/><img alt=""IDEAS Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7116/7699262368_8271a52603_m.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""IDEAS""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>With powerful allies such as these, ongoing support from our existing base, and with your help in pushing us over the edge, we will surely make this vision a reality.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>OUR TECHNOLOGY</strong></h3>
<p>To achieve this goal, KWW employs a multi-prong strategy featuring a security component, on-line policy control and safe social networking.  The security component is achieved through our proprietary Wizard Lock Security, which restricts access by throwing a protective bubble around your child while on the internet, making it virtually impossible for your child to land in an inappropriate site.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Wizard Lock"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8161/7699170682_b8743d792a_m.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Wizard Lock""/></p>
<p>This security feature is also different from other filtering products in that it does not try to interpret ever-changing content coming from a dynamic Internet to determine whether the content is safe or not. Instead, the application will restrict access to trusted content that has been reviewed and approved by trained analysts and an active artificial intelligence model that automates the approval system. The approval system is divided by age and the software is separately designed for age groups of 4 to 6, 7 to 8, 9 to 10, 11 to 12, and 13 to 14.  The content for KWW is a blend of Internet technologies including HTML, Flash and streaming media (some features being redesigned and added near term).  The approved content is categorized and matched to the child so that the child receives age-appropriate content and sites that include games, education, sports, secure email, secure chat, secure text, and secure social media.  While the access includes millions of web pages and sites, the key phrase here again is “age appropriate”. </p>
<p>By simply entering a code, parents have the ability to override the controls in KWW and may turn off security to allow open, unfettered access to the Internet. And this can be done remotely.  In addition, parents can override the content restrictions within KWW to allow a child to view specific content not on KWW’s age-appropriate content listing, or parents can further restrict access.  </p>

<h3><strong>OUR THOUGHTS</strong></h3>
<p>As a company, we believe so strongly that parents and our children need the KidWideWeb, our officers and directors, family and friends, have contributed over $1 million to help us develop our secure internet platform. We need only $200,000 more to upgrade our software and redesign our interface in order to complete what we started several years ago. </p>
<p>The updates and redesign will be accomplished by a group of highly talented and skilled technology experts, aided by our strategic partnership with IDEAS of Orlando, a former division of Walt Disney Inc., and through our participation in the University of Central Florida’s award-winning Business Incubator Program.  IDEAS gives us the creative expertise that only a Disney experienced group can provide, and UCF's Incubation Program gives us access to the university's extensive resources, including its programming talent pool, its cutting edge equipment and technology, as well as its numerous business affiliations and partnerships. Together, with your help and contributions, we can make the internet safer, for all of our children.  <strong>The KidWideWeb- ""Taking Control of the Internet, One Child at a Time!!""</strong></p>

<h3><strong>FAQ's</strong></h3>
<p><strong>How do I get the product and can I use it on a cell phone?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The software will be available to download off our site and it will be available on all media platforms including desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile phones, and gaming systems</li>
</ul><p><strong>Do I need to get more than one subscription if I have 2 or more kids?</strong></p>
<p>NO, one subscription should be all you need per household.  It can be downloaded to 3 separate devices and used for up to 6 logins per device...that is a desktop can handle 6 different users, with 6 separate logins and accesses.  More than one person can share the same login, but they will then have the same internet access. A single subscription is designed to accommodate most every family size.</p>
<p><strong>As a parent, do I need a secure login and what access will I have?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, any person sharing the same internet device, will need his own login as he/she tries to access the internet.  Once the internet is requested, a login screen will appear.  For a parent or adult, logging in will automatically turn off all security features and the full internet will be at your disposal.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Is the system subject to being hacked?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our system is a completely closed system in that the only sites available are there because we put them there.  Since the system has been built from the ground up and we are not using filters, which by their very nature can be circumvented (just google ""how to hack and insert the name of any filtering technology ""), our system is virtually impossible to hack.  If an attempt is made to circumvent the security software, the internet ""breaks"" figuratively, and will not work at all until an administrator, or a parent, resets the system.  The parent then immediately gets a notification as to what sites were trying to be accessed and what areas were attempted to be compromised.</li>
</ul><p><strong>What about viruses and malware?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since our system contains only the sites that we have approved, and those sites get checked for virus and malware before they are added to our content pool, it is unlikely that any of our sites will contain any viruses or malware.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Can we guarantee the security of the sites?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With the ever-changing world of the internet where the good guys are always trying to keep up with the bad guys, it is impossible to guarantee.  However, since our model is differentiated from all others in that we do not filter sites, but rather add them from a clean slate, we feel confident that our system gives the user the best and most consistent access to only those sites that are requested and nothing else. </li>
</ul><p><strong>How quickly can changes and access be made and access granted, if needed?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changes can be made and access granted remotely, in seconds, from any internet enabled device.</li>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>How much will it cost?</strong></p>
<ul>
