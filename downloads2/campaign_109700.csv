<h3>Breve reseña</h3> <p></p>
<p>Desde hace dos años nos hemos dedicado a recuperar la sabiduría antigua con la que los Maya teñían sus tejidos de forma natural; hemos identificado las plantas y los árboles que utilizaban preguntando aquí y allá, hemos recogido las semillas de las plantas que crecen en los bosques, hemos hecho un banco de semillas y hemos hecho un Estudio de Viabilidad Vegetal para saber cuál es la mejor manera de germinar las semillas y poder cultivar las plantas en un huerto controlado. Ahora queremos expandir este pequeño huerto-madre en varios huertos-hijos, de modo que se puedan cultivar de forma controlada las plantas tintoreras usadas antiguamente, y recuperar su uso para teñir ropa de forma natural.</p>
<p>El objetivo es que las mujeres de las comunidades Maya, a menudo empobrecidas y muchas veces en riesgo de exclusión social, encuentren una manera de salir adelante, una fuente de ingresos estable. Las mujeres de las comunidades Maya no tienen acceso a la propiedad de la tierra, que está en manos de los hombres, tampoco acceden al mercado laboral para que las mejores oportunidades las ocupan los hombres, ya menudo deben encargarse solas del mantenimiento familiar.</p>
<p>La creación de un huerto de plantas tintoreras y la obtención de tejidos tradicionales teñidos de forma natural es una buena oportunidad para ellas, ya que les abriría las puertas a un sistema de auto-financiación ética y sostenible.</p>
<p>Ahora nos encontramos con que se ha generado interés por la labor ya hecha, pero no tenemos recursos económicos para seguir adelante. Disponemos del terreno, pero necesitamos ampliar el huerto de plantas tintoreras, hacer un pequeño invernadero, también un abrigo desde donde hacer el trabajo cuando llueve (la temporada de lluvias dura seis meses) y desde donde mostrar las técnicas a otros mujeres, grupos o asociaciones, también a los turistas, claro, poner riego por goteo (el agua es escasa durante la temporada seca), comprar herramientas agrícolas de mano, y dar a conocer lo que hacemos.</p>

<h3>Un poco de historia</h3> Ancestralmente, los tintes naturales usaban no sólo para la ropa, también para pintar los murales de los templos, decorar las casas y pintar el propio cuerpo con motivos ornamentales. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">En la tradición textil se mezclaban los tejidos de algodón con los de maguey, las plumas y objetos diversos como pedrería y detalles de metal. Todo formaba parte del lenguaje corporal y de signos que se conoce como la cosmovisión Maya.</span><p></p>
<p>En la actualidad, después de tantos años, y debido a la dinámica de toda cultura y también a elementos externos como la aún reciente guerra civil en Guatemala, el terremoto del año 1976, o el huracán Mitch, la inestabilidad social es elevada, muchos de estos conocimientos se han olvidado o están a punto de olvidarse, o bien han sido superpuestos por los de otras culturas dominantes. Hoy en día ya tan sólo algunas ancianas recuerdan las antiguas técnicas de teñido con plantas, y la demostración de cómo se hacía ha quedado relegada a un mero papel turístico. Pero las mujeres, en su papel social de madres, gestoras de la vida y transmisoras de cultura, han utilizado el lenguaje de los colores y de las geometrías de los tejidos como un texto de palabras silenciosas que ha llegado hasta hoy en día (aunque la mayoría ya usen hilo de algodón transgénico y teñido artificialmente en otros países).</p>
<p>La zona del lago Atitlán es especial, no sólo porque su microclima favorece la reproducción y crecimiento de muchas especies vegetales, sino también porque la lengua y la tradición Maya se conservan muy intensamente (la lengua Tz'utujil, el Cakchiquel y el Quiché que se hablan en el lago Atitlán son las 3 lenguas principales de las 22 lenguas Maya que aún hoy se conservan, repartidas entre el norte de Guatemala y Chiapas, en el sur de México).</p>
<br/><p></p>
<p> </p> </div> <div> <h3>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</h3> <p></p>
<p>Tan sólo pedimos 1.000€, pero en Guatemala con esta cantidad se pueden hacer muchas cosas! Queremos comprar herramientas agrícolas de mano porque no tenemos suficiente para todos, queremos hacer un sistema de riego por goteo, un pequeño invernadero de 10m2 y una Choza tradicional, hecha con materiales locales (madera y hoja de palma) donde las mujeres puedan refugiarse cuando llueve (la temporada de lluvias dura seis meses del año, y llueve todas las tardes) y así seguir trabajando.</p>
<p>En el pequeño invernadero queremos hacer germinar las semillas de las especies silvestres que hemos ido recogiendo, ampliar el banco de semillas y que las podamos distribuir localmente entre otras mujeres interesadas en teñir el algodón de forma natural.</p>
<p>En la Choza queremos instalar un pequeño fuego central de leña donde se pueda calentar el agua que luego utilizaremos para teñir el algodón, así como poner unos tendederos donde secar el hilo de algodón ya teñido. También será un lugar de reunión y de demostración del proceso.</p>
<p>El huerto debe ser el motor central del proyecto, un huerto-madre desde donde se puedan hacer crecer las plantas que hasta ahora se recogían de forma salvaje y que sirva de banco vegetal para otras mujeres interesadas en recuperar la tradición.</p>
<p>Hemos hecho un pequeño presupuesto que no tiene en cuenta la mano de obra, sólo los materiales, porque lo haremos todo nosotros:</p>
<p>Construcción de la Choza: 700 €</p>
<p>Compra de herramientas de mano (azadas, picos, palas ...): 50 €</p>
<p>Construcción de un sistema de riego por goteo: 50 €</p>
<p>Construcción de un pequeño invernadero: 50 €</p>
<p>Varios utensilios para la germinación de semillas y reproducción por esqueje: 50 €</p>
<p>Abono orgánico: 50 €</p>
<p>Compra de ollas y otros utensilios para el teñido del algodón: 50 €</p>
<p>TOTAL: 1.000€</p>
<p>Aunque no consigamos TODO el dinero, cualquier cantidad nos servirá para seguir trabajando.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>El impacto</h3> <p></p>
<p>Todo ello nos servirá para abrir un mercado hasta ahora inexistente, y así crear una fuente de riqueza para las pequeñas comunidades de mujeres que viven alrededor del lago Atitlán.</p>
<p>No tenemos otra fuente de financiación. No creemos en las ONG, muchas de las cuales vienen aquí a hacer creer que son solidarias, que quieren ayudar, y gastan un poco de dinero para justificar sus enormes ingresos y luego se van dejando la misma situación de antes. Queremos avanzar por nuestros propios métodos, sin deber nada a nadie y sin paternalismos.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Este proyecto es interesante desde cuatro vertientes: 1) porque supone la recuperación de la cultura Maya; 2) porque cohesiona la comunidad y la hace más sostenible económicamente; 3) porque supone el fortalecimiento del papel de la mujer en la sociedad; 4) porque implica el respeto por la naturaleza y el cultivo ecológico.</p>
<h3>Experiencia previa</h3>
<p>Este proyecto ya lleva dos años de andadura, sin ayuda económica alguna y todo gracias a la confianza mútua del pequeño equipo local. Tenemos formaciones muy diversas pero un interés común; nuestro equipo ""multidisciplinar"" està formado básicamente por mujeres de las comunidades Maya del lago Atitlán, pero también por otros voluntarios, como yo mismo. </p>
<p>A nivel de crowdfunding, he organizado 3 proyectos (Verkami), y los tres consiguieron llegar a la financiación total: el libro ""El largo camino de escribir"", de Cesk Freixas y Marc Freixas, el libro ""Ta Kritiká - viaje por la música de Creta "", de Jordi Alsina, y la obra colectiva ""Historias vecinales"", dirigida por Josep Melero.</p>
<p>A nivel de proyectos sociales, hace dos años que colaboro con diversas asociaciones, fundaciones privadas y ONG en Guatemala, desde las estadounidenses ""Mayan Families"" (<a href=""http://www.mayanfamilies.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mayanfamilies.org</a>) y ""Niños del lago"" (<a href=""http://www"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www</a>. ninosdellago.org), a la guatemalteca ""Ati't Ala"" y la española ""Exterior XXI"" (AECID). Antes había colaborado con Médicos Sin Fronteras y fuí uno de los primeros voluntarios de la Asociación de Familiares de Enfermos de Alzheimer de Cataluña (AFAC).</p>

Desde hace dos años nos hemos dedicado a recuperar la sabiduría antigua con la que los Maya teñían sus tejidos de forma natural; hemos identificado las plantas y los árboles que utilizaban preguntando aquí y allá, hemos recogido las semillas de las plantas que crecen en los bosques, hemos hecho un banco de semillas y hemos hecho un Estudio de Viabilidad Vegetal para saber cuál es la mejor manera de germinar las semillas y poder cultivar las plantas en un huerto controlado. Ahora queremos expandir este pequeño huerto-madre en varios huertos-hijos, de modo que se puedan cultivar de forma controlada las plantas tintoreras usadas antiguamente, y recuperar su uso para teñir ropa de forma natural.
El objetivo es que las mujeres de las comunidades Maya, a menudo empobrecidas y muchas veces en riesgo de exclusión social, encuentren una manera de salir adelante, una fuente de ingresos estable. Las mujeres de las comunidades Maya no tienen acceso a la propiedad de la tierra, que está en manos de los hombres, tampoco acceden al mercado laboral para que las mejores oportunidades las ocupan los hombres, ya menudo deben encargarse solas del mantenimiento familiar.
La creación de un huerto de plantas tintoreras y la obtención de tejidos tradicionales teñidos de forma natural es una buena oportunidad para ellas, ya que les abriría las puertas a un sistema de auto-financiación ética y sostenible.
Ahora nos encontramos con que se ha generado interés por la labor ya hecha, pero no tenemos recursos económicos para seguir adelante. Disponemos del terreno, pero necesitamos ampliar el huerto de plantas tintoreras, hacer un pequeño invernadero, también un abrigo desde donde hacer el trabajo cuando llueve (la temporada de lluvias dura seis meses) y desde donde mostrar las técnicas a otros mujeres, grupos o asociaciones, también a los turistas, claro, poner riego por goteo (el agua es escasa durante la temporada seca), comprar herramientas agrícolas de mano, y dar a conocer lo que hacemos.



Un poco de historia Ancestralmente, los tintes naturales usaban no sólo para la ropa, también para pintar los murales de los templos, decorar las casas y pintar el propio cuerpo con motivos ornamentales. En la tradición textil se mezclaban los tejidos de algodón con los de maguey, las plumas y objetos diversos como pedrería y detalles de metal. Todo formaba parte del lenguaje corporal y de signos que se conoce como la cosmovisión Maya.
En la actualidad, después de tantos años, y debido a la dinámica de toda cultura y también a elementos externos como la aún reciente guerra civil en Guatemala, el terremoto del año 1976, o el huracán Mitch, la inestabilidad social es elevada, muchos de estos conocimientos se han olvidado o están a punto de olvidarse, o bien han sido superpuestos por los de otras culturas dominantes. Hoy en día ya tan sólo algunas ancianas recuerdan las antiguas técnicas de teñido con plantas, y la demostración de cómo se hacía ha quedado relegada a un mero papel turístico. Pero las mujeres, en su papel social de madres, gestoras de la vida y transmisoras de cultura, han utilizado el lenguaje de los colores y de las geometrías de los tejidos como un texto de palabras silenciosas que ha llegado hasta hoy en día (aunque la mayoría ya usen hilo de algodón transgénico y teñido artificialmente en otros países).
La zona del lago Atitlán es especial, no sólo porque su microclima favorece la reproducción y crecimiento de muchas especies vegetales, sino también porque la lengua y la tradición Maya se conservan muy intensamente (la lengua Tz'utujil, el Cakchiquel y el Quiché que se hablan en el lago Atitlán son las 3 lenguas principales de las 22 lenguas Maya que aún hoy se conservan, repartidas entre el norte de Guatemala y Chiapas, en el sur de México).

    Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes 
Tan sólo pedimos 1.000€, pero en Guatemala con esta cantidad se pueden hacer muchas cosas! Queremos comprar herramientas agrícolas de mano porque no tenemos suficiente para todos, queremos hacer un sistema de riego por goteo, un pequeño invernadero de 10m2 y una Choza tradicional, hecha con materiales locales (madera y hoja de palma) donde las mujeres puedan refugiarse cuando llueve (la temporada de lluvias dura seis meses del año, y llueve todas las tardes) y así seguir trabajando.
En el pequeño invernadero queremos hacer germinar las semillas de las especies silvestres que hemos ido recogiendo, ampliar el banco de semillas y que las podamos distribuir localmente entre otras mujeres interesadas en teñir el algodón de forma natural.
En la Choza queremos instalar un pequeño fuego central de leña donde se pueda calentar el agua que luego utilizaremos para teñir el algodón, así como poner unos tendederos donde secar el hilo de algodón ya teñido. También será un lugar de reunión y de demostración del proceso.
El huerto debe ser el motor central del proyecto, un huerto-madre desde donde se puedan hacer crecer las plantas que hasta ahora se recogían de forma salvaje y que sirva de banco vegetal para otras mujeres interesadas en recuperar la tradición.
Hemos hecho un pequeño presupuesto que no tiene en cuenta la mano de obra, sólo los materiales, porque lo haremos todo nosotros:
Construcción de la Choza: 700 €
Compra de herramientas de mano (azadas, picos, palas ...): 50 €
Construcción de un sistema de riego por goteo: 50 €
Construcción de un pequeño invernadero: 50 €
Varios utensilios para la germinación de semillas y reproducción por esqueje: 50 €
Abono orgánico: 50 €
Compra de ollas y otros utensilios para el teñido del algodón: 50 €
TOTAL: 1.000€
Aunque no consigamos TODO el dinero, cualquier cantidad nos servirá para seguir trabajando.

    El impacto 
Todo ello nos servirá para abrir un mercado hasta ahora inexistente, y así crear una fuente de riqueza para las pequeñas comunidades de mujeres que viven alrededor del lago Atitlán.
No tenemos otra fuente de financiación. No creemos en las ONG, muchas de las cuales vienen aquí a hacer creer que son solidarias, que quieren ayudar, y gastan un poco de dinero para justificar sus enormes ingresos y luego se van dejando la misma situación de antes. Queremos avanzar por nuestros propios métodos, sin deber nada a nadie y sin paternalismos.

Este proyecto es interesante desde cuatro vertientes: 1) porque supone la recuperación de la cultura Maya; 2) porque cohesiona la comunidad y la hace más sostenible económicamente; 3) porque supone el fortalecimiento del papel de la mujer en la sociedad; 4) porque implica el respeto por la naturaleza y el cultivo ecológico.
Experiencia previa
Este proyecto ya lleva dos años de andadura, sin ayuda económica alguna y todo gracias a la confianza mútua del pequeño equipo local. Tenemos formaciones muy diversas pero un interés común; nuestro equipo ""multidisciplinar"" està formado básicamente por mujeres de las comunidades Maya del lago Atitlán, pero también por otros voluntarios, como yo mismo. 
A nivel de crowdfunding, he organizado 3 proyectos (Verkami), y los tres consiguieron llegar a la financiación total: el libro ""El largo camino de escribir"", de Cesk Freixas y Marc Freixas, el libro ""Ta Kritiká - viaje por la música de Creta "", de Jordi Alsina, y la obra colectiva ""Historias vecinales"", dirigida por Josep Melero.
A nivel de proyectos sociales, hace dos años que colaboro con diversas asociaciones, fundaciones privadas y ONG en Guatemala, desde las estadounidenses ""Mayan Families"" (www.mayanfamilies.org) y ""Niños del lago"" (www. ninosdellago.org), a la guatemalteca ""Ati't Ala"" y la española ""Exterior XXI"" (AECID). Antes había colaborado con Médicos Sin Fronteras y fuí uno de los primeros voluntarios de la Asociación de Familiares de Enfermos de Alzheimer de Cataluña (AFAC).

    Riesgos y desafíos  

Riesgos: En la base de los problemas se encuentra, como ya es usual en este tipo de proyectos, el alto grado de analfabetismo y de desescolarización de la población local, sumado a un progresivo descontento social por la falta de alternativas laborales, con la consecuente fragmentación de las familias y creación de colectivos marginados (en este caso, principalmente las mujeres).

Las alternativas de cambio se ven dificultadas por la propiedad de la tierra en manos de los hombres y por un desigual nivel de acceso al mercado laboral: las profesiones están reservadas a los hombres; los salarios por servicios domésticos, en el caso de la mujer, están peor pagados. Se suman a estos factores el creciente turismo en manos extranjeras, que se apodera de los mejores enclaves y relega a la población local a ser meros espectadores, y también la expansión de monocultivos ( café, maíz) que se venden a cooperativas que, a su vez, venden a multinacionales que fijan los precios.
A nivel del presente proyecto, se detecta el problema de la fragmentación de las organizaciones de mujeres, lo cual dice mucho de su desorganización interna y falta de efectividad. También se advierte el desconocimiento de técnicas de cultivo ecológico y de silvicultura.

Otro reto a superar es la creciente presencia en el mercado local de hilo de algodón transgénico teñido mediante procesos sintéticos, que ha sustituido prácticamente en su totalidad al hilo tradicional, provocando una pérdida de valor de la artesanía y resultando en que los colectivos de mujeres se vuelven dependientes del mercado textil internacional. La principal barrera a superar es el precio final del hilo local teñido mediante procesos ecológicos y naturales.
El turismo juega un importante papel a la hora de valorar este tipo de productos y las organizaciones locales que hay detrás de ellos. El turismo local es una oportunidad pero también es un reto, ya que las asociaciones de mujeres deben organizarse de modo que puedan atenderlos. En este sentido, uno de los retos a superar es el desconocimiento del comprador, que no distingue entre un tejido elaborado por métodos tradicionales e hilo natural de otro confeccionado con hilo sintético.
Finalmente, el gran problema sigue siendo, como siempre, la falta de recursos económicos. Este proyecto supone arrancar una pequeña iniciativa que puede ser multiplicada sinérgicamente y “copiada” a otras localidades de Guatemala, mejorando la calidad de vida global.

Desafíos: Para este proyecto se parte de los resultados ya obtenidos (Estudio de Viabilidad Vegetal, o identificación de los sistemas más adecuados de germinación de semillas silvestres y desarrollo de plántulas en invernadero) que permitirá pasar de la recolección silvestre de plantas tintoreras a su cultivo organizado. 


El objetivo general, sin lugar a dudas, es la mejora de la calidad de vida de las comunidades de mujeres de la zona de Atitlán, rompiendo el círculo que les niega el acceso al trabajo remunerado y aumentando el nivel de sus ingresos fijos. En el fondo, se trata de lograr una mayor cohesión social y familiar.  Los objetivos específicos son, por un lado, conseguir que las mujeres de Atitlán se organicen en un sistema de producción basado en sus propias tradiciones y conocimientos, darles formación en cultivo ecológico y sostenibilidad, y formación en gestión de asociaciones y/o microempresas familiares. Por otro lado, son objetivos específicos de este proyecto también revalorizar el mercado local de artesanía y fomentar el turismo cultural sostenible en la zona.



Resultados esperados:• La ampliación del actual huerto ecológico, en el cual formar a las mujeres, reproducir semillas de plantas tintoreras y poder ofrecerlas a los grupos de cultivadoras para expandir su cultivo.
• Organizar de forma sistemática el proceso de teñido en un único centro del cual puedan servirse todas las mujeres tejedoras. 
• La formación de las mujeres en cuestiones de organización interna, sistemas de control y gestión comunitaria efectiva.
• La revalorización del mercado local artesanal tradicional y la promoción ante el turismo cultural hace necesaria la creación de sellos de calidad claramente diferenciables.
• La expansión de este sistema organizativo y de producción a todas aquellas otras comunidades de mujeres de Guatemala que así lo deseen.
• Lograr que su organización interna sea suficientemente efectiva como para que no sea necesario, por más tiempo, el soporte externo.

28'. This book was first published in 2004 in 
Germany, followed by a Czech, American, Polish and a Brazilian edition.

The aquarell below was made by Helga Pollak, in Art Lessons with Friedl Dicker-Brandeis in Room 28, Theresienstadt, 1943/1944. It was the front-page of the 1996 Calendar published by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. The accompanying text said, that it is from Helga Pollak, followed by the words: ""Her fate is unknown"". - Those who read the book ""Mein Theresienstädter Tagebuch"" will learn about Helga's fate and life.Aquarell by Helga Pollak, Theresienstadt, 1943/1944",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

in the world (the most beautiful,
to us).</span><br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We meet the tourists who visit our city every
single day. We often stop to talk to them and give them information.<b> Some of them even become our friends.</b></p>
<p>Everyone is charmed by Venice. But,
having said that, we know that many of her visitors encounter <b>more troubles
than they could have imagined.</b></p>
<p>Tips in tourist information leaflets are often
incomplete or misleading, and sometimes prices aren’t clear. In general, life for
tourists in Venice is much more difficult than it is for locals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 169, 224); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Let us give you some real examples:</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li>H.D. from Portland, Oregon, had
     planned to visit Italy for six months, but had to go back after just two:
     he came across so many hidden costs that he ran out of money.</li>
<li>Two friends from Ukraine, right
     after landing at the airport, spent more money on bus tickets than they
     should have done. The next day, a shopkeeper short-changed them. </li>
<li>One of us (Elvio), was speaking
     English with an American friend at a bar counter. They ordered a coffee
     and were charged 1.50€ instead of the regular price of 1€. When Elvio
     asked for explanations (in Italian) they were charged the correct
     price. </li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just a few examples of
the kind of unfortunate experience it is possible to have in Venice. (You could
find many more on the Internet). The way we see it, all of them could easily have
been avoided with the help of a <b>local
buddy.</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 169, 224); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Just imagine how much easier life
would be for all tourists if they had a local friend to guide them with hints
and tips on how to avoid bad deals, saving money and time, and generally living
like a local.</b></span></p>
<p>For all those reasons, we decided
to do something. We want to make sure that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every tourist returns home with
     only beautiful memories.</li>
<li>The reputation of Venice is protected
     from the dishonesty of the few.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our hope is that our work will
set an example <b>not only for Venice but for every Italian city</b>, that
tourists will be respected and treated fairly as a result, and – why not? – that
one day everyone will have an Italian Buddy ready to help them.</p>

</div></div>","Who we are: Italian buddies
We are three Italian friends and we have an idea.





We live in Venice, one of the most spectacular cities
in the world (the most beautiful,
to us).

We meet the tourists who visit our city every
single day. We often stop to talk to them and give them information. Some of them even become our friends.
Everyone is charmed by Venice. But,
having said that, we know that many of her visitors encounter more troubles
than they could have imagined.
Tips in tourist information leaflets are often
incomplete or misleading, and sometimes prices aren’t clear. In general, life for
tourists in Venice is much more difficult than it is for locals.



Let us give you some real examples:

H.D. from Portland, Oregon, had
     planned to visit Italy for six months, but had to go back after just two:
     he came across so many hidden costs that he ran out of money.
Two friends from Ukraine, right
     after landing at the airport, spent more money on bus tickets than they
     should have done. The next day, a shopkeeper short-changed them. 
One of us (Elvio), was speaking
     English with an American friend at a bar counter. They ordered a coffee
     and were charged 1.50€ instead of the regular price of 1€. When Elvio
     asked for explanations (in Italian) they were charged the correct
     price. 

Those are just a few examples of
the kind of unfortunate experience it is possible to have in Venice. (You could
find many more on the Internet). The way we see it, all of them could easily have
been avoided with the help of a local
buddy.
Just imagine how much easier life
would be for all tourists if they had a local friend to guide them with hints
and tips on how to avoid bad deals, saving money and time, and generally living
like a local.
For all those reasons, we decided
to do something. We want to make sure that:

Every tourist returns home with
     only beautiful memories.
The reputation of Venice is protected
     from the dishonesty of the few.

Our hope is that our work will
set an example not only for Venice but for every Italian city, that
tourists will be respected and treated fairly as a result, and – why not? – that
one day everyone will have an Italian Buddy ready to help them.



What You Get

 
So, how are we going do to it?
We are writing a concise and
direct guide to Venice. Inside, you won’t find any cultural information,
nor any advice on restaurants or hotels of the sort you’d find in a traditional
guidebook.
What you will find instead are practical
and honest suggestions that only locals could know, which will help
you to save tons of money
and time.

 What you will find


You will find concise, honest
     and direct advice on enjoying Venice without wasting money and time.
You will learn some of the tricks
     that tourists find most difficult to figure out.
You will learn how to spot
     tourist traps like an Italian
You will find frank
     explanations of what to avoid and what to enjoy, and maps showing all the
     most important things, like toilets!

An example? Did you know that if
you sit down in a bar and order a coffee the price will be higher than if you
drink it standing at the counter?








What you won’t find



You won’t find cultural
     information about monuments or the city itself. There are already hundreds
     of guides like that and they can tell you a lot more than we ever could.
You won’t find long, rambling paragraphs
     that mean that you have to read through ten lines of text when you just
     want basic answers.
You won’t find hotel or
     restaurant recommendations. Why would we bother? There are already amazing
     websites where you can find reviews of every place in town. Why should you
     trust us more than them? And how could you be sure that our recommendations
     are honest and not sponsored, like those of many other guides?

What we need and why

So, how much does all this cost? 
The sad news is that
we've had already a few expenses:



Graphic design (logo, cover, t-shirts, etc.): 800$
Website domain and related expenses: 250$
Translation: 1000$
Video shooting: 300$
Test prints and inDesign classes: 300$
Advertising: 400$
Legal and financial consulting: 200$

The total, approximately,
3250$, is the amount we hope to raise with this campaign.

The Impact
 
As we’ve said, we feel like our
country (Italy) isn't doing enough to protect its reputation amongst tourists.
Many people see them as a resource to exploit and not as a mean for sharing our
culture.
We (Italians) have always been a
little shortsighted. We tend to have excellent ideas but we often lack
the perseverance to plan things ahead and bring them to a conclusion.
That's why so many people don't understand that whilst exploiting a tourist on
their holiday is certainly profitable in the short term it
will irremediably damage our image over time.
Instead, we, your Italian buddies
want to put an end to this, as much as we can. We’re starting with Venice
because it’s our city and we know it well but, as we said, we like to think
that we're just beginning. Our next targets are Rome, Florence and Milan.

So let us ask you: would you help us help tourists like you, not just in Venice, but in all the major cities of Italy?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a PhD student in English literature and an experienced writer and editor. I wanted to self-publish my poetry, so I did -- and I figured I'd keep using my layout and editing skills to publish other people's work, too. Right now, creators get a percentage of sales from the booklets and PDFs. I would love to be able to pay my authors up front just for contributing, on top of the sales percentage. I would also love the hire other editors from the LGBT community to help me with copyediting. Paying creators and editors from my community is especially important to me. Your donation can make that happen!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Right now, I pay for all printing costs out of pocket. Each run of 30 booklets costs about $90 CAD. On top of this, my labour (editing, layout, communicating with creators/printing company, and illustrating if necessary) means that each run costs me about $250 at minimum wage on top of the printing costs. If I had a crowdfund to draw on, this would ease the burden on me financially and allow me to print more booklets. My goal is a pie-in-the-sky goal, and any bit helps! </li>
<li>For supporting Lemniscate Small Press via IndieGoGo, you will get the satisfaction of knowing you are paying members of the LGBT community for their creative output, helping up-and-coming writers get a wider platform, AND the reward for which you qualify. </li>

All proceeds go towards proving training and mentorship to support young African women into entrepreneurship and technology

Why is this book important?
The lack of visible role models hinders many young African women from becoming tech entrepreneurs who can create solutions that solve challenges in their communities.
The Founding Women book will share the inspiring entrepreneurship journeys of African women who are overcoming the odds to build successful, high-impact businesses in tech.
Our goal is help break down the barriers preventing young African women from becoming future tech leaders by highlighting role models and providing mentorship
We are interviewing inspirational founders such as Rebecca Enonchong, CEO of AppsTech who was named one of the top female tech Founders to watch in Africa by Forbes (Read her interview) and Hilda Moraa - Founder & CEO of Pezesha who previously founded Weza Tele, the first African tech startup to successfully exit when it was acquired by JumoWorld in 2015 -  as well as other established and upcoming founders working in energy, health, software and fintech. View our growing list of female founders.
 
How will the funds be used?
Apart from printing and delivery costs, all contributions will go towards our training & mentorship programme supporting young African women to kick-start their businesses.
Milestones & targets


£4500 - Will enable us to print  100 books, donate 50 books and provide 50 hours of mentorship to young African female entrepreneurs over the next 6 months.

£7500 - Will enable us to print 200 books, donate 100 books & provide 100 hours of mentorship to young African female entrepreneurs over the next 6 months.

£10000 - Will enable us to print 300 books, donate 150 books & provide 200 hours of mentorship to young African female entrepreneurs over the next 6 months.


About our Training & Mentorship Programme
HerFutureAfrica is our programme equipping young African women to build tech-enabled businesses that create change in their communities. 


To date we have provided mentorship to 32 young female entrepreneurs in Ghana. Watch the video from our startup bootcamp in Accra.
One of them was 26 year old Ivy Barley, joined our programme with just a rough idea and her passion for teaching others to code. We helped her carry out market research to refine her idea, develop her business proposal and pitch deck and connected her with a mentor. She and her co-Founder also met and connected at our bootcamp! Just a few months down the road,  she has won multiple awards, pitched in front Angela Merkel and won  €15,000 to launch her venture Developers in Vogue which is now training 20 young women in Ghana to code.

<p>Hi. I am Dr. Catherine Pesek Bird, Founder of Paratus Consulting. My mission is <i>to inspire, to educate &amp; to motivate</i> you, to be prepared for a medical emergency in your life, and in the lives of your loved ones.  As a cardiologist by training, I have worked with many patients and their loved ones, to help them to determine what they want done <i>for</i> them, not just done <i>to</i> them.</p>
<p>I have seen the stress that comes from not being prepared, for the patient and for their loved ones.  I believe you want to have control and I can help you achieve it.   I am passionate about my work with clients, and their loved ones, to help them to personalize their healthcare decisions.</p>
<p>Only about 20% of patients have an advanced directive, some written form of what they want done, in the event of a medical emergency.  Of those that do, studies show that about 70% of them are not certain of all of their choices, even after their physician explains their choices.  Some just complete the standard form offered on line or with their attorney, without an opportunity to personalize their choices.  Although some people name a person to speak for them, a  healthcare agent, rarely do they truly empower that person to speak for them.  This makes a difficult situation even more so!</p>
<p>I believe you do not want this confusion and uncertainty.  I believe you want to be in control and have your healthcare decisions known and your agent empowered to speak for you.  </p>
<p>My next project is a book that will help even more people to be prepared for life’s medical emergencies by personalizing their healthcare decision.  It is called <i>Your Voice, Your Choice: Personalizing Your Healthcare Decisions</i>. But I need your help.</p>
<p>I need to raise $5620 to cover the cost of bringing the book to life, in terms of: 1) editing, 2) proofreading, 3) cover designing, and 4) printing, or the book will not exist. So, I am turning to you, my strongest supporters, to ask for contributions. In exchange, I am offering perks, such as:</p>
<p>·     Autographed copies of the book,</p>
<p>·     Book club opportunities with me, to share our medical emergency experiences, and,</p>
<p>·     One-on-one time with me, to review your choices and to empower your agent.</p>

<li>Recovery of the Russian economy despite the oil price crash and the sanctions</li>

<p>We have provided you with clear, objective reporting of the DNC/Podesta emails, of the Russiagate scandal in the US, and of the Korean crisis.</p>
<p>We have done all these things, getting these stories right where the MSM has got them all wrong.  What we report today, they (sometimes) report tomorrow, often copying us without attribution.</p>
<p>We have done this with only a tiny fraction of the resources that they have, in the face of a campaign by them to ban and shut down all sources of alternative news including the one we provide.</p>
<p>All this we have achieved purely through our own hard work.  We are a wholly independent transparent news provider bound to and associated with no-one and dependent on and controlled by no-one.  All of us are known, and we are proud that this is so, and all money we receive is fully and publicly accounted for.</p>
<p>Hard work however can only take us so far.  However much better we are than our MSM rivals, however hard we work, the simple fact is that we are massively outgunned.</p>
<p>You can help to change that.  </p>
<p>We are now crowdfunding to make our site grow, to add other sites to it, to give ourselves proper technical back-up, so that we can extend our reach, provide an even better news service and beat the barriers of large corporations, that under MSM encouragement, are in our way from telling the truth.</p>
<p>If you believe that there is a need for good objective news, for people to be properly informed so that they can make proper decisions decided on by themselves, if you want to know what is really going on and why, then we ask you to support us.</p>
<p>This is a key moment.  </p>
<p>Together we can defeat the news monopoly the failing MSM is abusing in order to retain its undeserved position of pre-eminence. Without your support it just cannot be done.</p>
<p>That is why we ask <strong><i>you</i></strong> to support this crowdfunding campaign.</p>

</div></div>","The Duran has been in existence now for well over a year...
In that time, we called these major events right, where most were dead wrong:

The Brexit vote
Donald Trump's victory
Russian victory in the Syrian war
Recovery of the Russian economy despite the oil price crash and the sanctions

All things the MSM said would NEVER happen, and with a fraction of the resources.
Imagine what we could do with more...

Here are some articles written by The Duran's Editor-in-Chief that prove our analysis was correct:

We have provided you with clear, objective reporting of the DNC/Podesta emails, of the Russiagate scandal in the US, and of the Korean crisis.
We have done all these things, getting these stories right where the MSM has got them all wrong.  What we report today, they (sometimes) report tomorrow, often copying us without attribution.
We have done this with only a tiny fraction of the resources that they have, in the face of a campaign by them to ban and shut down all sources of alternative news including the one we provide.
All this we have achieved purely through our own hard work.  We are a wholly independent transparent news provider bound to and associated with no-one and dependent on and controlled by no-one.  All of us are known, and we are proud that this is so, and all money we receive is fully and publicly accounted for.
Hard work however can only take us so far.  However much better we are than our MSM rivals, however hard we work, the simple fact is that we are massively outgunned.
You can help to change that.  
We are now crowdfunding to make our site grow, to add other sites to it, to give ourselves proper technical back-up, so that we can extend our reach, provide an even better news service and beat the barriers of large corporations, that under MSM encouragement, are in our way from telling the truth.
If you believe that there is a need for good objective news, for people to be properly informed so that they can make proper decisions decided on by themselves, if you want to know what is really going on and why, then we ask you to support us.
This is a key moment.  
Together we can defeat the news monopoly the failing MSM is abusing in order to retain its undeserved position of pre-eminence. Without your support it just cannot be done.
That is why we ask you to support this crowdfunding campaign.
What is DRN Media?
DRN Media is the organization we created that manages and maintains The Duran and other sites (which you may have already seen) and which employees our staff of 8 full-time writers and managers. DRN Media has absolutely no government affiliations, and we are 100% independent and reader supported.

This is who we are:

The Duran -  a conservative media platform that reports on global affairs from a realpolitik position (www.theduran.com)


 

RussiaFeed - a news aggregator and analytical platform that is the FASTEST source for news on Russia (www.russiafeed.com)


 

Red Pill Times - a social news and content aggregator that reports on the ridiculous world of identity politics, virtue signaling, and political correctness (www.redpilltimes.com)


 
COMING SOON: Hellenic Insider - a conservative media platform that reports the true situation in Greece, not a sugar-coated picture which is repeatedly given.

During HCPT's Easter pilgrimages to Lourdes for disabled and disadvantaged children, many special events take place. One such event is the publication of Father Perry Gildea's daily reflection known as the ""Grotto Jottings"".The daily reflection, written and published in Lourdes over the Easter week, has been ongoing for many years. In HCPT's Diamond Jubilee 60th anniversary year, the Pope's Jubilee of Mercy, HCPT would like to put together some of the most popular Grotto Jottings from previous years. We would use them to publish a beautiful book called Jubilee Jottings. As a reader, you would be able to reflect on the spirituality of Lourdes and share a part of the HCPT pilgrimage.   HCPT is a charity and we do not think it would be fair to use the donations of our supporters on this project - we maintain they should always go directly to helping those who travel with us.

Many talented and skilled writers apply and only sixteen make the cut.In one day I went from believing I hadn’t made it, to being over the moon, and fretting over the monetary logistics. What is Odyssey?The Odyssey Writing Workshop is a six week, writing intense, workshop for writers of fantastic fiction encompassing fantasy, science fiction, horror, magical realism, and works that fall into the in-between. Find out more about the workshop here.About MeHi! I'm Chloie Piveral.
I have a super power. I
can arrange symbols together on a page, in small groups, and by doing so I
place pictures and ideas in another person’s head. I may never even meet that
person, but by doing so I can create a bond, and a shared emotional experience.
I can cause them to replay experiences from their youth, or a lost loved one, or
experience empathy or joy in a way never before experienced. And it is time to
share my superpower with the world.
That's just another way to say, I write fiction. In addition to writing, I am a creative consultant and a costumer. I've had an opportunity to do a great many things so far in my life, but the one passion that always draws me back is writing fiction.My WorkI've written for business magazines, run writing workshops, and consulted on books for other writers. Teaching and helping others is  great way to learn. I’ve been writing and helping others with projects

<p><b>What was your inspiration for the Countdown Mysteries?</b></p>
<p>When I was a child I had a best friend called Rob. We lived on the edge of Sherwood Forest and had some great adventures together. He was like the brother I never had. I want to write about children who have true friends and share amazing adventures just like Rob and me. I want my characters to feel the same way about each other as we did all those years ago. </p>
<p><b>What makes the Countdown Mysteries series unique?</b></p>
<p>Characters! I want the characters in my books to be smart and thinking detectives. I loved watching Agatha Christie mysteries on television. Her detectives used their brains to solve crimes. I want to give my readers characters like that. That’s why my three main characters solve mysteries using their intelligence and teamwork. I can’t remember another series of alphabetical mysteries that works its way backwards through the alphabet. Mine do, and the characters also solve their mysteries against a countdown clock that ticks down towards zero. </p>
<p><b>Who are these books for?</b></p>
<p>My books are for anyone who loves a good mystery. Some of the language I use is simple so my books and their stories are accessible to children between the ages of 7 and 10. I also love to add a few twists and surprises to add interest and intrigue. It’s great to throw in more challenging vocabulary to stretch my readers and to teach them new words. Even now as an adult I always still love learning new words and then trying to use them that day somehow. </p>
<p><b>Who are your favourite authors?</b></p>
<p>I love John Grisham books. I’ve read nearly everything he’s written. I love the way his characters use their intelligence and wits to achieve what they are doing. I also adore the books by Will Randall and Polly Evans. Both authors write about their travel adventures and use humour effectively. I know a lot of people think Enid Blyton books are old fashioned now but I used to love those too. Her characters had so much fun and they always worked well as a team – just like my characters!</p>
<p><b>What do you plan to do with the funds you raise?</b></p>
<p>It’s been great planning and writing the first books of the Countdown Mysteries series. To continue to develop the series and to write more and more books in the series I need the funds I raise from this crowd funding campaign. I want to send my books to print and have a stock that children can access from my author website. I’m also going to visit schools across Asia later this school year so having a stock of books to take with me would be absolutely fantastic.</p>

<p></p></div>","Books to Inspire Your Child to Read & Write We live in a world that celebrates violence and taking things by force. The news is full of stories of tragedy and human suffering, and it’s not just our grown up world either. The world our children experience is sadly not so different. As a parent myself, I am horrified when my child watches cartoons that portray characters winning by brute force, or using aggression and martial arts skills.

My books provide children with role models who achieve great things using their intellect, their guile and by working collaboratively with others.
 My main characters are three young children with a shared passion for reading mystery books. Roly, Nine and Charlie work from a hi-tech basement clubhouse. Using a variety of cool gadgets, they work together to use their detective skills, intelligence and keen powers of deduction to solve mysteries and crimes in their small town of Anchor Bay.   

What these three young detectives have in common are the shared qualities I believe are important for youngsters today: 


Integrity
Loyalty
Intelligence
A Great Sense of Humour

<h3>Empowering Young Cancer Patients With Writing<br/>
</h3>
<p>Inspired
by the young patients of a pioneering, Boston-based pediatric oncologist, Dr. Giannoula Lakka
Klement, <i>Engagement With Life</i> will publish a book by 13-year-old Ava D'Ambrosio and plan an integrative program to teach writing for self-expression and growth to children with cancer.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460565239/FullSizeRender_1_vv2hkf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>When Ava first came
 to see Dr. Klement several years ago, she was suffering with a 
pre-cancerous, overgrown spleen and brittle bones from previous 
prednisone treatment. Now, her condition under control with continuing 
therapy, Ava has her radiant life back. An outstanding student and talented writer, she 
participates in theater,
plays the piano, and hopes someday to become a hematologist.<br/><br/>""I want 
other kids to know it's
important not to give up,"" Ava says. With the publication of her book about her illness, 
and with the planned inclusion of contributions from her family, Dr. Klement, and program director Carl Vigeland, 
readers everywhere will be able to share in this life affirming story.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><br/><span></span>A keystone of Dr. Klement’s
practice is for her patients to remain connected
to the people and places around them. After the shock of a diagnosis, and with
all the challenges of getting better compounded in these cases by the factor of
age, a young person with cancer can feel especially lonely, dealing not only
with an insidious disease but an experience that can seem unfathomable. In addition to Ava's book <i>Engagement
With Life </i>will develop detailed plans and educational materials, including photography, to 
launch a multifaceted program for other children of varying ages and cancers who are grappling with that experience.  <br/>
<p></p>
<h3> Launching a Beta Program and Pilot Project<br/>
</h3>
Though writing programs for prison inmates and other programs integrated
 with music and art for patients have been very successful, <i>Engagement With Life</i>
 and its emphasis on the therapeutic impact of writing represent
something new and innovative for young cancer patients. <br/><br/>For some children with cancer, confined to a hospital bed or at home,
 the program will create in-person tutorials with a distance or online 
learning
component. For others, able to be out and about, planning will be made 
for field trips to sporting
 and
musical events or just a walk on the beach or by a beautiful river, 
providing a takeoff for writing
as young essayists and journalists. The program's team is currently exploring strategic relationships with several
Boston-based and national sports and arts organizations. Among these are the
Boston Symphony Orchestra, which has already offered to provide concert tickets.<br/><br/><h3>A Committed Team and Passionate Vision</h3>Program founder and director Carl Vigeland, a
long-time writer and educator, met Dr. Klement two years ago near the beginning of his work
on a forthcoming book<i>.</i> With an honors degree from Harvard, where he did volunteer tutorial
work at Roxbury elementary schools, and a masters degree in education from the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, he has taught at every level, from
E.S.L. children as young as kindergarten age to post-graduates in the
award-winning UMass Certificate in Online Journalism, which he helped develop. <br/><br/>A core team of other team members— an acclaimed book publisher, an outstanding 
graphic arts
designer, a veteran social media expert, and an advanced student with many community connections—will assist <i>Engagement With Life</i>'s
 inception and
evolution. Our focus, of course, is on the children the program will 
benefit, and our ambition is give the beta program a shape and depth 
that will enable us to seek an eventual partnership with a medical 
institution. As the program grows, we will enlist the advice of a lawyer
with experience in non-profits and get help from an expert in distance 
learning software. We will also explore a process to 
select and train volunteers. <br/><br/>
<h3>Your Donation Will Make it Happen   <br/>
</h3>
<p>Teaching time will be on a pro bono basis. To
plan and organize <i>Engagement With Life </i>and
insure the success of both its pilot project and program formation--with a completion date for both of six months after our launch--we need funds software, legal advice for incorporation as a non-profit, overhead and administration, travel (including insurance), design and book publication. <br/></p>
<p></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460384363/meta-chart_1_dxlbgc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>If we fall short of our initial goal, the program will still go forward with publication of its book in an e-format. Funds in excess of our goal will accelerate the initiation of related programs with several sports and arts 
organizations, including a golf experience that children who are able to participate will then also write about and a similar activity using jazz. Additionally, as the program grows, we will reach out to other localities to explore implementation on a wider basis. <br/><br/>
<h3>A Unique Program Will Have a Growing Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p>From
its very beginning, with the writing and publication of its pilot project, <i>Engagement With Life </i>will have an immediate
impact both on the life of its young author and its many readers, young and
old. Throughout the process, donors to the program will receive regular progress
reports, and we will in the meantime consult with Dr. Klement on each step the program takes. By the time we reach the final, partnering phase of the program, we will seek media coverage to spread the word.</p>
<p>As an expression of gratitude and acknowledgment of donor
generosity, a number of perks commemorate the support the program
seeks; if you wish to receive a perk, remember to check the box within the donation portal. And please note that the e-book download that is offered with each perk will be available upon completion of the beta program and pilot project. <br/></p>

all the challenges of getting better compounded in these cases by the factor of
age, a young person with cancer can feel especially lonely, dealing not only
with an insidious disease but an experience that can seem unfathomable. In addition to Ava's book Engagement
With Life will develop detailed plans and educational materials, including photography, to 
launch a multifaceted program for other children of varying ages and cancers who are grappling with that experience.  

 Launching a Beta Program and Pilot Project

Though writing programs for prison inmates and other programs integrated
 with music and art for patients have been very successful, Engagement With Life
 and its emphasis on the therapeutic impact of writing represent
something new and innovative for young cancer patients. For some children with cancer, confined to a hospital bed or at home,
 the program will create in-person tutorials with a distance or online 
learning
component. For others, able to be out and about, planning will be made 
for field trips to sporting
 and
musical events or just a walk on the beach or by a beautiful river, 
providing a takeoff for writing
as young essayists and journalists. The program's team is currently exploring strategic relationships with several
Boston-based and national sports and arts organizations. Among these are the
Boston Symphony Orchestra, which has already offered to provide concert tickets.A Committed Team and Passionate VisionProgram founder and director Carl Vigeland, a
long-time writer and educator, met Dr. Klement two years ago near the beginning of his work
on a forthcoming book. With an honors degree from Harvard, where he did volunteer tutorial
work at Roxbury elementary schools, and a masters degree in education from the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, he has taught at every level, from
E.S.L. children as young as kindergarten age to post-graduates in the
award-winning UMass Certificate in Online Journalism, which he helped develop. A core team of other team members— an acclaimed book publisher, an outstanding 
graphic arts
designer, a veteran social media expert, and an advanced student with many community connections—will assist Engagement With Life's
 inception and
evolution. Our focus, of course, is on the children the program will 
benefit, and our ambition is give the beta program a shape and depth 
that will enable us to seek an eventual partnership with a medical 
institution. As the program grows, we will enlist the advice of a lawyer
with experience in non-profits and get help from an expert in distance 
learning software. We will also explore a process to 
select and train volunteers. 
Your Donation Will Make it Happen   

Teaching time will be on a pro bono basis. To
plan and organize Engagement With Life and
insure the success of both its pilot project and program formation--with a completion date for both of six months after our launch--we need funds software, legal advice for incorporation as a non-profit, overhead and administration, travel (including insurance), design and book publication. 


If we fall short of our initial goal, the program will still go forward with publication of its book in an e-format. Funds in excess of our goal will accelerate the initiation of related programs with several sports and arts 
organizations, including a golf experience that children who are able to participate will then also write about and a similar activity using jazz. Additionally, as the program grows, we will reach out to other localities to explore implementation on a wider basis. 
A Unique Program Will Have a Growing Impact

From
its very beginning, with the writing and publication of its pilot project, Engagement With Life will have an immediate
impact both on the life of its young author and its many readers, young and
old. Throughout the process, donors to the program will receive regular progress
reports, and we will in the meantime consult with Dr. Klement on each step the program takes. By the time we reach the final, partnering phase of the program, we will seek media coverage to spread the word.
As an expression of gratitude and acknowledgment of donor
generosity, a number of perks commemorate the support the program
seeks; if you wish to receive a perk, remember to check the box within the donation portal. And please note that the e-book download that is offered with each perk will be available upon completion of the beta program and pilot project.

<p>Iris has been inspired by the menstrual cycle since before she started bleeding. She is a Cycle Awareness Educator, anthropologist, doula who LOVES making the earth shake with positive change - especially through writing.<span><br/></span></p>
<p>'Menstrual Revolution' is all about creating more awareness about the subject of period blood,  the menstrual cycle in general and how to make mindful choices concerning birth control and menstrual management. We have the brains, the knowledge and the bodies and yet we do not seem to be able to connect those. This book is a catalyst for body positivity, menstrual badassery and healthy options [for both our bodies and the planet]. Because I believe we deserve to treat ourselves to the luxury of knowing our gorgeous bodies and how to support them in the best, most healthy way possible.<span><br/></span></p>

That's where YOU come in - a tribe of supporters who all believe in the necessity of this book and the change it will ignite.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>All of the money will be used to do research, get access to articles + books + video material I need (for research), cover some travel costs I will have to make to do interviews with 'big folks' in the field, photography, illustrations, translations, cover design, printing, self-publishing in hardcopy and digital versions, and in two languages . Since I want to publish in Dutch and English at the same time, I am obliged to self-publish (unless you are that TWO awesome publishers wanting to back me up on this!).<span><br/></span><span>If I do not reach the entire goal, the money will still go to everything stated above, yet the number of books printed will be smaller.</span></span></p>
<p>If you support this campaign, you are rewarded with thank-you-gifts. I will be giving a way the most epic products I received from gorgeous companies whose vision is similar to mine. My gratitude is endless and I can't wait to send these life-changing, body- and planet-friendly products to you!<span><br/></span></p>

<p>And here's a little explanation of all the perks:</p>
<b>Moon Chart + Moon Meditation audio</b><span><br/></span>
<p>--a guided Moon Meditation, with the voice of yours truly, to tap deeper into your bleeding time and really focus on what it means for your body, mind and spirit to be menstruating. The Moon Chart teaches you how to connect your own cycle to moon and her cycles.</p>
<p><b>Reusable Pads*</b><span><br/></span><span>--EcoFemme (India) and ImseVimse (Sweden)<br/>These pads are your toxic-free reusable option: use them, wash them, use them again (they last for years!).

<p><b>Menstrual Cups*</b><span><br/></span><span>--RubyCup (Germany), Lunette (Finland) and OrganiCup (Denmark)<br/>All of the cups I am giving you are made of medical grade silicon, can be worn up to 12 hours, are easy to clean and gentle to wear. Each cup comes with a little bag to store it in.<br/><br/>Oh ps: keep your cup away from pets! -- I had a cat eat mine......Whoops!<span><br/></span></span></p>

it's time. period.

 This book will change the world, ditch taboos and shift ideas. Sounds pretty awesome, right?!On this page you find everything you need to know about the book, pre-ordering, how to support and of course: what YOU will get!
Iris has been inspired by the menstrual cycle since before she started bleeding. She is a Cycle Awareness Educator, anthropologist, doula who LOVES making the earth shake with positive change - especially through writing.
'Menstrual Revolution' is all about creating more awareness about the subject of period blood,  the menstrual cycle in general and how to make mindful choices concerning birth control and menstrual management. We have the brains, the knowledge and the bodies and yet we do not seem to be able to connect those. This book is a catalyst for body positivity, menstrual badassery and healthy options [for both our bodies and the planet]. Because I believe we deserve to treat ourselves to the luxury of knowing our gorgeous bodies and how to support them in the best, most healthy way possible.
This campaign is YOUR chance to add your cup of awesomeness to the party.   • What I Need & What You Get • I can't do this alone. There is research to be done, writings to be completed, covers to be designed, interviews to be held, etc. Just to be very direct and clear: I need €20.000 to make this happen and I simply don't have the money. That's where YOU come in - a tribe of supporters who all believe in the necessity of this book and the change it will ignite.All of the money will be used to do research, get access to articles + books + video material I need (for research), cover some travel costs I will have to make to do interviews with 'big folks' in the field, photography, illustrations, translations, cover design, printing, self-publishing in hardcopy and digital versions, and in two languages . Since I want to publish in Dutch and English at the same time, I am obliged to self-publish (unless you are that TWO awesome publishers wanting to back me up on this!).If I do not reach the entire goal, the money will still go to everything stated above, yet the number of books printed will be smaller.
If you support this campaign, you are rewarded with thank-you-gifts. I will be giving a way the most epic products I received from gorgeous companies whose vision is similar to mine. My gratitude is endless and I can't wait to send these life-changing, body- and planet-friendly products to you!
Here's a sneak preview for all that's waiting for you:

We are authors:  Narate Keys (The Changes...Immigration Footprints of Our Journey) and Peuo Tuy (Khmer Girl)  appreciate your support and donation to help us promote the multi-state “Art of Healing Book Tour 2016,” running April through September.
We believe young Cambodians and other oppressed people should voice their identities and experiences as children of immigrant parents affected by war and genocide. Other artists and communities are invited to help explore these questions: How do we process intergenerational trauma? How do we negotiate our identities in this ever-changing world? How have we overcome adversity? We hope to make a positive impact in the communities we visit by promoting storytelling and conducting writing and self-empowerment workshops.
The itinerary for the tour, featuring free spoken word poetry performances, writing and self-empowerment workshops, yoga (Minnesota location), conversations with Q&A periods, and open mics, look like this:


Minneapolis, Minnesota: April


Chicago, Illinois: end of June


Northern California: beginning of July  — mid-July


Southern California: mid-July — end of July


Seattle, Washington: mid- September








   What We Need & What You Get

We would like your help to raise $6000 by April 30th, 2016.  We’ve set aside some of our own personal funds to go on this promotional book tour. We’ve also saved
money to print our own poetry books too,  but we would still like your help. Here is where your money will go:  To help pay for transportation, housing, food and refreshments for events, workshop and office supplies, space and equipment rentals,
marketing and promotional materials, and other miscellaneous fees . 
Perks for your donations:



$5 - Personal
“Thank You” cards with our autographs and positive quotes mailed to you to
your home.  We truly value and appreciate your support!


 $10- All of the above + one hand-written poem of choice from the books
with our autographs mailed to you to your home.  


$20- All of the above + one personal video hang-out with both authors. We will read and perform our poems and speak about overcoming adversity. 


$30- All of the above + 6  spoken word poetry MP3 downloads (3 from each author); will include mixtures of musical backdrop soundtracks and  acapella tracks. 


$50- All of the above + 6 spoken word poetry MP3 downloads (3 from each author); will include mixtures of musical backdrop soundtracks and  acapella tracks + autographed books from each author.


$100- All of the
above + one promotional recognition and appreciation of your business during book tour via  our websites and your banner at all of our events.


$500 - All of the above + sponsor a writing and self-empowerment workshop.  Your contribution will encourage those who come from
any history of trauma – genocide, war, oppression, damage relationship - to view writing and self-empowerment
workshops as a way to heal and overcome obstacles.  With this healing via workshops, we hope to create more positive and
self-determined people who we believe will live happier and healthier lives so
that we can interdependently live in a society where there are less hate, wars,
genocide, and greed. We believe that people who work together cohesively become
successful people. It is only when people are healed from trauma we can begin
to be more giving and loving towards each other, ourselves, and we can finally live our lives the
way we truly want to.


$1,000 -  All of the above + a portion
of your contribution will go to non-profit organizations that participate in social justice
work: National Asian Pacific American Women Forum (Minnesota), Khmer Girls in
Action (Long  Beach, CA), Mekong NYC (New
York City), and two- three organizations who are in need of funding for Syrian refugees.


  $5,000 -  All of the above + two special spoken word poetry readings,  2 writing and
self-empowerment workshops, and book signings at your location (will include a limited number of donated books for your organization).


If we do not reach our entire goal, we will still commit
to the above perks as much as we can, and use some of the funds to help us on
the promotional book  tour. We appreciate any donations and are very happy and super excited
to get this on the road!

    The Impact

The impact:  Creating future generations of healers, thinkers, shakers, and doers!


It is
important to acknowledge those who have gone through traumas in their lives. It
not only happens in our own homes, but in other parts of the world, too. For
example, due to the current state of Syrian refugees re-settling into the
United States, it is important to bring up topics of war, oppression,
trauma, and repression. It is vital as a nation to support the innocent
children, mothers, and fathers whose lives are being drastically changed.  We believe we are placed on earth first to
help others, then, we help ourselves. When you help others you in turn
help yourself.  This level of commitment gives rise to compassion, love, and
peace, thus creating a more serene and harmonious place to live in. 
We both come from the genocide that occurred
in Cambodia in the mid 1970’s. We feel that as spoken word poets and educators who have a
history of genocide and repression, it is pertinent that our voices be
heard.  Literature, art, writing and
self-empowerment workshops are crucial healers for the current generations of Cambodians and oppressed people. 
With the influx of Syrian refugees
coming into the U.S or any families/people who are experiencing trauma, we
believe that every human being should have access to food, shelter, clothing,
education, and positive motivational tools to help them heal. We had those opportunities
when we first arrived as refugees to this country. Shouldn’t everyone else, no
matter what the traumas are? With your
contribution, you will help us tell our stories of trauma, genocide, and overcoming adversity. You will also not only get the perks above, but you will help create many more generations of healers, thinkers, shakers, and doers!
*A portion of your donation will go to helping organizations (if the $1000 perk is chosen) who are working to help Syrian refugees adjust to living in the United States.

I'm an urban planner and an amateur 
historian. I love my city, and I love researching its history. This book, titled <i><b>Transforming Ottawa: Canada's Capital in the Eyes of Jacques Gréber</b></i>,
 was inspired by the rediscovery, at the National Archives, of
 a large collection of hauntingly beautiful street scenes of Ottawa in 
1937-39, commissioned by Jacques Gréber, the French urban planner hired 
by the Prime Minister of the day (W.L. Mackenzie King) to prepare a 
master plan for our city. The book looks at the city as Gréber saw it in
 1937, when he first set foot in Ottawa, describes his famous 1950 plan,
 and discusses its outcomes and effects on our city.</p>
<p>If you live in Ottawa, chances are you’ve heard of the <b>Gréber Plan</b>.
 Now 65 years old, this blueprint for our city was almost entirely 
implemented over the decades and, in many ways, has defined the city as 
we know it today. But what did Ottawa look like before the Gréber Plan? 
What did that Plan see as the city’s burning problems, and how did it 
propose to resolve them? In hindsight, how did the solutions play out? </p>
<p>The book contains about 300 of these incredibly sharp and crisp 
black-and-white Ottawa street scenes from the late 1930's, in high 
resolution. You will see photos of streets and corners that are now 
unrecognizable, and some that have stayed amazingly identical to how 
they looked 75 years ago.
</p><p>The book itself is 
intended as a contribution to the ongoing conversation about our growing
 city, its planning history, and its present-day challenges. I feel that
 it's important to know where we've been in order to better map out the 
future. Especially these days, with all the exciting projects that are 
taking place in Ottawa, the much stronger sense of civic identity 
emerging in our city, and the genuine interest in the stories and 
legends of our past, this book is intended to become a reference about 
the pivotal 1950 master plan by Jacques Gréber that changed the face of 
our city in a number of ways.</p>
<p>This is my second book - in 2004, I published <em>""<i>A Theatre Near You: 150 years of going to the show in Ottawa-Gatineau</i>"",</em> a history of Ottawa-Gatineau theatres. That book is almost sold out -  the last remaining copies are at <a href=""http://www.perfectbooks.ca/PB/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Perfect Books</a><b></b>, corner Elgin &amp; Somerset (Ottawa).<br/></p>

<h3>2 years in the Making</h3>
<p>Getting our story from concept to hardcover started with nothing but closed doors, challenges and setbacks.  The struggles of the character Jacob in the book ironically mirrored our struggles along the way.  But we didn’t give up.  We believed enough in our project that we put our heart, soul, money and even our house on the line when we decided to self publish. Here we stand today with the first run of hardcover books ready for shipment in November.</p>
<ul>
<li>We wish to continue the Journey of Jacob in his second story plus we have several other great books already started. It takes a lot of time, funds, and fans to bring a project to life. We have great perks for donations including volume discounts for giving books to others or your favorite charities. Your help will allow us to help others.</li>
<li>Our goal is to create fun engaging books that kids want to read.  It all starts with you and Operation Hula Hoop. Every time you see a child exercising with a  hula hoop, you will think, “I was a part of that.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Jacob the Caterpillar wins you over in this fun, exciting, rhyming, counting, picture book that will make you want to get up and hula hoop! In this motivational story you will share the day with young Jacob while he struggles with a roller coaster of emotions all because he steps out of his comfort zone to learn how to Hula Hoop! He finds out that he does not have to follow the crowd to fit in. With some kind words of advice from one of his elders, a passing butterfly, Jacob discovers the power of intention, practice makes perfect and never give up on your dreams.  </p>

<p>The day dreaming young caterpillar wins over the admiration of his friends. Children learn their numbers with fun rhymes as they count to twenty while discovering some of life's greatest lessons. At the end of the inspirational story adults are encouraged to teach kids to count higher and that hooping is fun exercise while Jacob keeps swishing that hoop until the sun goes down.</p>

<li>The beautiful Illustrations in this book were created by Kym who is a professionally trained illustrator and every stroke of color in the artwork was considered as important to our readers as every written word in the story.

</div></div>","2 years in the Making
Getting our story from concept to hardcover started with nothing but closed doors, challenges and setbacks.  The struggles of the character Jacob in the book ironically mirrored our struggles along the way.  But we didn’t give up.  We believed enough in our project that we put our heart, soul, money and even our house on the line when we decided to self publish. Here we stand today with the first run of hardcover books ready for shipment in November.

We wish to continue the Journey of Jacob in his second story plus we have several other great books already started. It takes a lot of time, funds, and fans to bring a project to life. We have great perks for donations including volume discounts for giving books to others or your favorite charities. Your help will allow us to help others.
Our goal is to create fun engaging books that kids want to read.  It all starts with you and Operation Hula Hoop. Every time you see a child exercising with a  hula hoop, you will think, “I was a part of that.”


 


Jacob the Caterpillar wins you over in this fun, exciting, rhyming, counting, picture book that will make you want to get up and hula hoop! In this motivational story you will share the day with young Jacob while he struggles with a roller coaster of emotions all because he steps out of his comfort zone to learn how to Hula Hoop! He finds out that he does not have to follow the crowd to fit in. With some kind words of advice from one of his elders, a passing butterfly, Jacob discovers the power of intention, practice makes perfect and never give up on your dreams.  

The day dreaming young caterpillar wins over the admiration of his friends. Children learn their numbers with fun rhymes as they count to twenty while discovering some of life's greatest lessons. At the end of the inspirational story adults are encouraged to teach kids to count higher and that hooping is fun exercise while Jacob keeps swishing that hoop until the sun goes down.





Hi! We are Kym & Stan the Authors & Co-Creators of The Caterpillar and the Hula Hoop Picture Book. We are a husband and wife team chasing our dream. We work extremely well together and so chose to use the pen name Festa Pfannkuch combining our names and representing ourselves as one entity. We write and create art together as a unified creative team bouncing ideas back and forth until the project is complete as if we had one mind. 
The beautiful Illustrations in this book were created by Kym who is a professionally trained illustrator and every stroke of color in the artwork was considered as important to our readers as every written word in the story. We created this book with nothing but the highest quality and best intention for the final product to sit on the shelf alongside other best sellers. We Just need a little help from our friends.



 

According to his accounts Dr. Suess was rejected by 20 to 43 publishers. He was about to burn his manuscript when a chance encounter with an old classmate led him to get his 1st children’s book published. In 1937 Suess forever changed the world of children’s books.
You, our fans, our online community are our chance to get our story heard.

Gnosticism</i> and books on <i>The Gospel of Philip</i>, <i>The Lost Sayings of

Gnostic: A Journal of Gnosticism, Western Esotericism and

<p>Besides my books, I have over the years written
several articles on Gnosticism and apocrypha. The topics range from
the Muslim Gospel of Barnabas and the mysterious Secret Gospel of
Mark to examinations of specific Gnostic writings, which are often
very difficult to understand without a guide. 
</p>

purposes. Gnostic Tendencies will collect together all of my articles
on Gnosticism and apocrypha, along with new pieces written specially

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Matt Wingett, the one man band who runs the publishing company Life Is Amazing. I'm dedicated to promoting Portsmouth and writers around the South Coast, and that's how I got involved in two brilliant projects.</p>
<p>The first is Day of the Dead - a collection of stories about Death and Dying, sourced from Portsmouth Writer's Hub. The Hub is a network connecting some of the best talent in Portsmouth. Writers have produced 28 stories all around the idea of Day of the Dead. Sometimes scary, sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, it's a collection that shows of the many voices connected to the Hub.</p>
<p>The second is Dark City - a project that was organised through Portsmouth University. The 18 contributors and 20 stories in the book are all set in Portsmouth... but not one quite as you know it. With tales of hauntings and strange transformations, the book is a great celebration of the scary side of Pompey.</p>
<p>I'm publishing the book, and would love to get these writers read by as many people as possible. Your preorder will enable me to print a larger print run and get the book out to even more people.</p>
<p>So, if you love Pompey and great storytelling, help us to get Portsmouth writers out there!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Guys, I'm only looking to meet a modest target that will fund the print runs of these books. Of course, the more I get, the bigger the print run and distribution.</p>
<p>But all I'm looking for is £200, Indiegogo's minimum is £500. If I get that - it'll be great!</p>
<p>Here's what I'm offering. It's really simple:</p>
<p><strong>1 BOOK = £9.99</strong></p>
<p><strong>ANY 2 BOOKS = 10% DISCOUNT = £18</strong></p>
<p><strong>ANY 4 BOOKS = 12.5% DISCOUNT = £35</strong></p>
<p><strong>ANY 10 BOOKS = 25% DISCOUNT = £75</strong></p>
<p>This gives you the opportunity to get that book out for your friends for Christmas. What you'll need to do is tell me the combination of books you want when you order.</p>
<p><strong>REMEMBER - postage within the UK will be free. I will need to get in touch with you to arrange delivery outside of the UK.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Firstly, THANK YOU for taking the time to read this and to order. It makes a huge difference to know that there are people out there supporting and helping Portsmouth writers be read by people all over the world.</p>
<p>This will enable me to offer the books into shops without worrying about the print costs - because I run the whole endeavour of Life Is Amazing on a shoestring.</p>
<p>Your support counts!</p>

I'm Valerie Williams-Sanchez, author of the ""Cocoa Kids Collection"" of children's books. In my first story, Isaiah and the Chocolate Mountain©, Isaiah stormed out of the house, into adventure, and our hearts. Then, in Eddie and the Hot Cocoa Hot Rod©, Eddie never gave up until he reached the Winner's Circle.  Now, in Lorena and the Magic Mocha Mirror©, Lorena is taking on beach blanket bullies to an empowering and happy ending.  Here's the story: Lorena's love of Magic Mocha Ice Cream makes her an easy target for body-shaming, beach bullies on her family's annual trip to Grandma Mimi's beach house. But when a trio of mermaid sisters turn the tide, and teach her that bodies come in all shapes and sizes, and to love her body in ""Lorena and the Magic Mocha Mirror,"" it's our pint-sized heroine who comes out on top. This Indiegogo campaign, again, seeks financial support to publish a title that will engage those among the most underserved of young readers, multicultural and ethnic minority children, in middle childhood.Some current data:   U.S. Trade Books Trends in Content By and About African-Americans  
The total number of children's titles, 2014-2016, has hovered around 3,400 - 3,500 per year
African Americans make up 12.5% of the U.S. population, though
Children's books By African Americans totaled only 3% of all books* in 2015 and 2016, and  
Children's books About African Americans totaled just 8% of all books in 2015 and 2016
The disparity is clear!
    * All books is defined as those books submitted to CCBC for survey and tracking purposes. Source: The Cooperative Children’s Book Center (CCBC) is a unique examination, study and research library of the School of Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Featuring the newest in the Cocoa Kids Collection Books' cast of multicultural characters, and the series' first female main character, ""Lorena and the Magic Mocha Mirror©"" includes Lorena, the real-life namesake of my own daughter in this, my third work of fiction and my initial endeavor as a book illustrator.The last publishing campaign achieved just 11% of its financial goal. This time, won't you join in, to give and share the word to help us reach at least 100% of our funding goal, $5,000. Please support this important project and become a publishing partner!When you do, you'll get cool perks** and acknowledgment for supporting one of traditional publishing's least represented segments - children of color.Be part of the movement!Thank you,Valerie ~ **Please note that perks that include signed copies of the book cannot be sent out until the book has completed the publishing process. Publishing time takes a minimum of three months.--------------------------------------------[Una traducción libre al español, hecho por Valerie Williams-Sanchez, el dia once de junio, 2017.]Hola! Soy Valerie, autora de la serie “La Colección de Libros de los Niños Cocoa.” En la primera historia del serie, “Isaiah y la Montaña de Chocolate,” Isaiah salió de casa y empezó una adventura, terminando con nuestro cariño. Luego, en la historia de ""Eddie y el Coche Fantástico de Chocolate,”  Eddie nunca se renunciaba hasta que llegó al circulo de ganadores. Ahora, en la historia de ""Lorena y el Espejo Magico de Mocha,"" Lorena se encuentra con unos joven matones playeros. Con la ayuda de unas amiga nuevas, su cuento llega al final feliz.La historia va asi: Lorena y su apetito para helado del sabor mocha se la deja vunerable a las malas intenciones de unos jovenes matones playeros cuando ella va a visitar a su abeula Mimi en su casa cerca del mar. Pero cuando unas hermanas sirenas cambia la situación y se la enseñan de que haya cuerpos de todos tipos y que se debe apreciar lo que tiene cada uno, es nuestra pequnita hero quien sale a tope. Este campaña, otra vez, busca el apoyo financiero del publico y nuestros aficionados para completar la publicación de este libro nuevo que intenta llena el necesidad de los leyedores cuyos intereses literarios son lo menos servido por la industria de libros infantiles. Algunos datos currentes:Tendencias por contenido pertinente sobre y por los Americanos de herencia Africana.
La cifra total de titulos infantiles* de los años 2014 al 2016 ha quedado cerca unos 3,400 al 3,5000 per año,
Aunque Americanos de herencia Africanos representan un 12,5% de la populación Americana,
Libros infantiles escrito por Americanos de herencia Africano numeraron a solo un 3% de todo los libros desde 2015 at 2016, y 
Libros infantiles escrito sobre Americanos de herencia Africano alcanzó a solo 8% de todo los libros publicado durante el mismo periodo. 
La disparidad es claro!
*Todo los libros es definido como todos que eran submetido al CCBA al propósito de encuesta y el mantenimiento de un record.Source: El Centro Cooperativo de Libros Infantiles (CCBC) es un centro biblioteca unica que enfoque en el estudio, la examinación y busqueda de la escuela de educación del Universidad de Wisconsin. Contando con los caracteres multiculturales mas nuevo de la ""Colección de Libros de los Niños Cocoa"" y la primera caracter femenina en el papel principal, “Lorena y el Espejo Magico de Mocha” incluye la Lorenita, quien es nombrado tras my hija del misma nombre. Es mi tercer libro infantil de ficción y mi primera proyecto como la ilustradora.La ultima campana de publicar gano solo 11% de su meta financiera. Esta vez, por favor de reunir con nosotros, dar y annunciar a sus amigos y associados a toman parte de este iniciativo y ayudanos obtener 100% de lo que haciamos falta, $5,000. Su apoyo de este proyecto es muy importante.

<ul><li> <strong>Humaine, femme, maman, épouse, starter, étudiante, professeur aimant la vie et l'étincelle en chaque humain</strong>. Durant plusieurs années j'ai cherché, à travers différentes formations une VOIE, la voie qui me permettrait d'englober toutes les facettes de notre être: physique, mentale, émotionnelle, physiologique, spirituelle; HOLISTIQUE. Le YOGA m'apporte, m'ouvre les portes à tout cela ! </li></ul>

<strong>Certains doivent se poser la question de: </strong><strong>POURQUOI m'aider à concrétiser ce voyage en Inde ?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Sincèrement: si j'étais fortunée je ne solliciterai pas d'aide, ce crowdfunding est la seule solution actuelle de financement à la continuité de mon étude.</p>
<p>Cet été, grâce à une bourse, j'ai pu intégrer la <i>1ère formation européenne de Yogathérapie</i> transmise par <i>Kausthub Desikachar</i> héritier de la lignée de T. Krishnamacharya et TKV Desikachar.</p>
<p>Cette formation holistique est une aventure de 3 ans et pour moi, dans la continuité des 4 premières années de formation de professeur de Yoga que j'ai suivie auprès de Frans Moors.</p>
<p>Et ceci n'est que le départ d'un parcours d'étude et de transmission, ceci est ma voie et mon chemin: recevoir &amp; partager.  </p>
<p>J'ai donc décider de me consacrer à l'étude du Yoga et de quitter toute autre activité afin de vous transmettre au mieux, de vous apporter des moments de bien-être, et de vous initier à cette philosophie dans la liberté de recherche de chacun.</p>

<strong>En soutenant ce projet</strong>, en me soutenant vous contribuez à l'acquisition d'outils qui me permettront de répondre au plus juste de vos demandes et besoins dans le cadre de séances que ce soit pour vos enfants, vos ados ou vous même!</li></ul>

<p><i><strong>Les risques pour VOUS:</strong></i><u> </u>sincèrement, si ce n'est, la découverte de ""quelque chose"" qui vous procure du positif et que vous risquiez d'y devenir accro ;-) je n'en vois aucun puisque je m'engage à fournir la contre-partie proposée et choisie selon un accord entre votre et mon agenda. </p>
<p><i><strong>Votre défi:</strong></i> essayez si vous ne connaissez pas, partagez avec vos proches s'ils ne connaissent pas et SIMPLEMENT profiter de ce moment que nous partagerons.</p>
<p><strong>Les risques et obstacles pour moi:</strong> j'ai le bonheur d'être soutenue par mon mari et nos 3 enfants  . Les élèves qui participent à mes cours seront suivis par d'excellents collègues. Je suis motivée et déterminée a relever les défis pour devenir le meilleur de moi même.</p>

 Humaine, femme, maman, épouse, starter, étudiante, professeur aimant la vie et l'étincelle en chaque humain. Durant plusieurs années j'ai cherché, à travers différentes formations une VOIE, la voie qui me permettrait d'englober toutes les facettes de notre être: physique, mentale, émotionnelle, physiologique, spirituelle; HOLISTIQUE. Le YOGA m'apporte, m'ouvre les portes à tout cela ! 
      ""  soit le changement que tu veux voir dans le monde""
Mahatma Gandhi

Certains doivent se poser la question de: POURQUOI m'aider à concrétiser ce voyage en Inde ?

Sincèrement: si j'étais fortunée je ne solliciterai pas d'aide, ce crowdfunding est la seule solution actuelle de financement à la continuité de mon étude.
Cet été, grâce à une bourse, j'ai pu intégrer la 1ère formation européenne de Yogathérapie transmise par Kausthub Desikachar héritier de la lignée de T. Krishnamacharya et TKV Desikachar.
Cette formation holistique est une aventure de 3 ans et pour moi, dans la continuité des 4 premières années de formation de professeur de Yoga que j'ai suivie auprès de Frans Moors.
Et ceci n'est que le départ d'un parcours d'étude et de transmission, ceci est ma voie et mon chemin: recevoir & partager.  
J'ai donc décider de me consacrer à l'étude du Yoga et de quitter toute autre activité afin de vous transmettre au mieux, de vous apporter des moments de bien-être, et de vous initier à cette philosophie dans la liberté de recherche de chacun.

En soutenant ce projet, en me soutenant vous contribuez à l'acquisition d'outils qui me permettront de répondre au plus juste de vos demandes et besoins dans le cadre de séances que ce soit pour vos enfants, vos ados ou vous même!

 Ce dont j'ai besoin et ce que vous obtenez

 Selon la réussite de ce projet je pourrai m'inscrire à une, deux ou aux 3 formations dont je vous parle dans ma video de présentation.
La somme réunie couvrira: les formations c'est la partie la plus conséquente, suivi individuel, les vols A-R,logement...
 Vos contreparties:

A CHACUN , l'accès au groupe "" En route pour Chennai "" où vous pourrez suivre: l'évolution du projet, de mes préparatifs MAIS où je partagerai, aussi, avec vous mes découvertes, impressions, reflexions et émotions tout au long de ce voyage !!!  
EN PLUS d'un COURS, d'un ATELIER ou d'un STAGE proposé  et...  
En EXCLUSIVITE "" Votre prof de Yoga et le pti déjeuner à domicile "", à vous de choisir :-)

Que vous soyez particulier ou une entreprise, je suis certaine que l'une de ces contreparties vous apportera un moment de bien-être à vous ou votre entourage!
Un cadeau à offrir ou à s'offrir à l'approche des fêtes !



 Risques et défis
 Indiegogo nous propose de vous parler des risques et défis de notre projet.... 
Les risques pour VOUS: sincèrement, si ce n'est, la découverte de ""quelque chose"" qui vous procure du positif et que vous risquiez d'y devenir accro ;-) je n'en vois aucun puisque je m'engage à fournir la contre-partie proposée et choisie selon un accord entre votre et mon agenda. 
Votre défi: essayez si vous ne connaissez pas, partagez avec vos proches s'ils ne connaissent pas et SIMPLEMENT profiter de ce moment que nous partagerons.
Les risques et obstacles pour moi: j'ai le bonheur d'être soutenue par mon mari et nos 3 enfants  . Les élèves qui participent à mes cours seront suivis par d'excellents collègues. Je suis motivée et déterminée a relever les défis pour devenir le meilleur de moi même.
D'ailleurs: je viens d'en relever 2!
 1er ->Etre devant la camera pour réaliser cette présentation video 
2ème -> Parler de moi ;-)
Le seul obstacle pour lequel je devrai m'incliner... un temps... est de ne pas atteindre l'objectif financier de ce crowdfunding.
 

Comment m'aider ?
 Chaque contribution est importante: que ce soit le partage de ce projet sur VOS réseaux sociaux ou un soutien financier
“Les petits ruisseaux font les grandes rivières.”

Peter John Rizzo, 1960 graduate of Yale University’s journalism program and an emerging creative writer, inherits Classic Art Exposé, an established but floundering art journal, from his uncle, John Rizzo.
Pete’s father, Peter Rizzo, is a banker who despises his late brother, scornful of his career in the Arts and Humanities, and jealous of his sibling’s influential relationship with his wife and son.
Jason, Uncle John’s devoted but unorthodox editorial assistant, and two local English student interns, sisters Shirley and Evie, help Pete start a monthly short story contest with artwork prompts, hoping to increase Classic Art Exposé’s readership and settle its debt.
As the four friends review and publish the winning short stories over the following eighteen months, Pete discovers a sordid family secret while he battles his father’s nefarious attempts to bankrupt his business and ruin his reputation.

<p>Welcome to the world of John T. Draper, better known as Captain Crunch, the original ""Phone Phreak"". From his early days of facing off against Ma Bell to his current role in public speaking and privacy advocacy, it’s hard to overstate his impact on the world of technology. Along the way, he developed some of the most influential tools of the computer revolution, from the first working word processor in the seventies to the first effective firewall in the nineties. The road hasn’t always been smooth, however, and for every success there have been setbacks and hurdles of literary proportion. Let’s just call it Draperism. </p>
<p>This ""warts and all"" biography features Draper's own telling of stories from the past fifty years, as well as commentary and other memories from his long-time friend and collaborator. It is the story of an eccentric genius who went from being a penniless hacker to a millionaire and back again, a man so consumed by his vision that the real world around him has always played second fiddle. Featuring a foreword by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and cameos by the who’s who of early computing, this Kerouacian journey gives us an inside look at the birth of modern computing through the eyes of one of its most influential pioneers.</p>

<br/>The Excerpts<br/> </h3><p><strong>Childhood anecdote by brother, Ron Draper</strong></p><p>There was this ‘mom and pop’ super market at the end of Edith St. in Petaluma, called 'The A &amp; B market'. It had light bulbs and licorice. John wanted bulbs. PR-2’s, PR-4 flashlight bulbs, and batteries, but as usual we had no money. Our mom would not concede to John’s wishes this time (these 'wishes' turned into outright demands when he became a teen), so we resorted to theft.</p><p>I can honestly say it wasn’t my idea. We had never stolen anything up to this point. I think I was blackmailed actually, but my dim memories don’t have the details. We thought we would use my calm demeanor and appointed me to actually steal most of the stuff. So, I was the one caught by the store manager as we were walking out.</p><p>We were asked to empty our pockets. I don’t remember what John had, but my pockets were loaded. I mean really loaded. 110v light bulbs, Christmas tree light bulbs, flashlight bulbs, AA batteries for my pen light (well, I thought, while I’m at it). I remember the store clerk adding up all the charges and it came to quite an amount.</p><p><strong>John and the Phone Phreaks</strong></p><p>I got a phone call from someone calling himself Denny San Jose, who told me he knew about various methods of making free phone calls. He also said there was this whistle that blew the magic tone that disconnects long distance calls, and that he had a spare. He asked me if I could drive him to San Francisco so he could show me how it worked.</p><p>---</p><p>I began to realise there was more to these guys than I first thought. They were a connected and organized group, and seemed to be inviting me to join. When the discussion got around to our trip to Burlingame, we talked about what my ‘handle’ should be. Most people had just chosen their first name and city, like ‘Denny San Jose’ or ‘Bill from New York’. Well, ‘John San Jose’ was already taken, so I said ‘how about Captain Crunch?’</p><p><strong>The first bust</strong></p><p>I suspected the FBI knew about me even before the Esquire article was released, but I had no idea how much they wanted to collar me. Up to that point all they had was the name Captain Crunch, but no way of finding out who I actually was. Most of the blind kids didn't know my phone number, and those who did had no need to write it down, but of course eventually I made the mistake of giving my number to the wrong person.</p><p>---</p><p>I made sure that I had removed all of my 'forbidden equipment' from my car, and stashed it in my gym locker. I took a non-working Blue Box out of my locker to take home and fix, put it in the back of my car then started the drive home. I stopped at a 7-11 to get a soda. I parked in a small parking lot next to a middle school, and just as I got out of the car, four FBI agents swooped down on me, handcuffed me, and read me my rights.</p><p><strong>Lompoc Prison</strong></p><p>In the 70's and 80's, they called Lompoc a Country Club. It was even home to Nixon's sleazy Watergate lawyer for a while, as well as many other celebrity prisoners. Contrary to popular lore however, it did not have a swimming pool, but it did have a nice gym, tennis courts, and Volleyball courts. I’m not sure that it still has those facilities these days. Apparently the whole place was turned into a medium security prison in the 90s, with proper fences and razor wire.</p><p>---</p><p>After a few weeks I was promoted to landscaping. It mainly consisted of cleaning. My supervisor was a guy named Easton. I used to watch this guy while I was outside cleaning his windows. He had this habit of sucking on his walkie-talkie 'rubber duck' antenna. I'd giggle as I imagined him as a suckling baby pig, wiggling his ears in pure bliss. One day I was in his office emptying his trash bin, and he got called out of his office. I couldn't believe he left me in there. I went looking through his files, but didn't find anything of much worth, then I checked out his phone to see if I could access anything outside of the prison.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512498624/gukhwqwgilchaolmms4n.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>John Thomas Draper - Co-author</strong></p><p>Mr Draper is a computer pioneer, privacy advocate, and public speaker.

Well, ‘John San Jose’ was already taken, so I said ‘how about Captain Crunch?’The first bustI suspected the FBI knew about me even before the Esquire article was released, but I had no idea how much they wanted to collar me. Up to that point all they had was the name Captain Crunch, but no way of finding out who I actually was. Most of the blind kids didn't know my phone number, and those who did had no need to write it down, but of course eventually I made the mistake of giving my number to the wrong person.---I made sure that I had removed all of my 'forbidden equipment' from my car, and stashed it in my gym locker. I took a non-working Blue Box out of my locker to take home and fix, put it in the back of my car then started the drive home. I stopped at a 7-11 to get a soda. I parked in a small parking lot next to a middle school, and just as I got out of the car, four FBI agents swooped down on me, handcuffed me, and read me my rights.Lompoc PrisonIn the 70's and 80's, they called Lompoc a Country Club. It was even home to Nixon's sleazy Watergate lawyer for a while, as well as many other celebrity prisoners. Contrary to popular lore however, it did not have a swimming pool, but it did have a nice gym, tennis courts, and Volleyball courts. I’m not sure that it still has those facilities these days. Apparently the whole place was turned into a medium security prison in the 90s, with proper fences and razor wire.---After a few weeks I was promoted to landscaping. It mainly consisted of cleaning. My supervisor was a guy named Easton. I used to watch this guy while I was outside cleaning his windows. He had this habit of sucking on his walkie-talkie 'rubber duck' antenna. I'd giggle as I imagined him as a suckling baby pig, wiggling his ears in pure bliss. One day I was in his office emptying his trash bin, and he got called out of his office. I couldn't believe he left me in there. I went looking through his files, but didn't find anything of much worth, then I checked out his phone to see if I could access anything outside of the prison.John Thomas Draper - Co-authorMr Draper is a computer pioneer, privacy advocate, and public speaker.

<p><strong>         </strong> Oopsie Daisy is a lovably adorable, clumsy, and forgetful, toddler elephant, who is loved by her parents no matter what she does.  The character of 'Oopsie' Daisy and the very first story of her adventures was partially inspired by Aurora, the King's own daughter.  When she, as most energetic, intelligent, children of two years of age do, was spilling, dropping, and soiling everything in sight, it was important to consciously make an effort to let her know that we all make mistakes and have little accidents every now and then...that it not only was not her fault, but that these things are a part of life; of how we learn and grow as human beings.  ""Our Perfect Little Child' is in part the physical representation of that effort.</p>

.</p><p><b> Introduction  </b></p><p>       Hello
everyone! As I have mentioned my name is Stoyko Rusev and I have been a writer
for a while now. In the next few lines I will give you some more details about
my work until now and my plans for the future.</p>
<p>The main goal of my campaign is to show my first book Blades
and Vicious Smiles to the world and gather money for the translation and
editing of the first 46 pages of my comic fantasy novel The Pyramid: A Prophecy
and my anti-utopian short stories based on diseases. For me it is very
important to receive feedback for my novel at this early stage of the creation
process, so I can upgrade it and eventually fulfill my dream to continue the legacy
of Terry Pratchett’s and Douglas Adams’ work.</p>
<p>The other project that I want to create is about my
anti-utopian short stories, and the main reason I want to bring them to the
world is because they, in my opinion, are a unique interpretation of our world
and have the potential to become a new branch of a very meaningful genre in
literature.</p>
<p>Your help will allow me show my projects to the world and
continue making good and meaningful works.</p>
<p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Where will your money go?</b></p><br/><p></p>
<p>I will give you a brief description of the expenses for which
your donations will go:</p>
<p>1) 
Translation – The translation of the first 46
pages of my comic fantasy novel and of my 
anti-utopian short stories (11 pages) will cost me 786$ (152$ for the
short stories and 634$ for the novel.)</p>
<p>2) 
Editing – Their editing will cost me 114$ (22$
for the short stories and 92$ for the novel.)</p>
<p>3)  Fees – A 4% indiegogo fee (40$
approximately),  3,5% (35 $
approximately) for Paypal fees, 25$ single fee for the transfer of the donated
founds from credit cards to my bank account after the end of the campaign.</p>
<p><br/></p><p> <b>Perks!</b></p>
<p><br/></p><p>I am giving my first book Blades and Vicious smiles away trough
the campaign. I want everyone to be able to see what I am capable of and then
decide if they wants to be a part my dream.</p>
<p>If I complete my goal everyone will be able to enjoy and
download my works for 2 months.</p>
<p>I have a vision that every supporter should get a reward for
his help and I would implement it in my perks. I have observed many indiegogo
campaigns and I decided to make a little change in the system, so in my perks
you will see two differences:</p>
<p>1) 
I have a perks for every 10% progress of my goal
to all people who had given me their support.</p>
<p>2) 
If my campaign reaches it’s goal I will upload
my works for 60 days on my dropbox so everyone will be able to enjoy them, not
only the big contributors.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>When will I be able to deliver perks?</b></p>
<p><br/></p><p>1) 
I will need 5 to 7 days to send the
“introduction to the universe” perk.</p>
<p>2) 
For the “recite a miniature for you” perk I will
need 10 days to be able to give you the best experience possible and your
choice of a miniature.</p>
<p>3) 
For the unique short story for you I will need
10-15 days depending on how fast my translator and editor will be able to do
their job.</p>
<p>4) 
The collective perk “thank you for your support”
will be delivered 3 days after the first vote, one day for the gathering of
your votes and 2 days for my preparation for each  perk performance.</p>

<br/><p></p></div>","New Perk I am proud to present  you my new perk  - my poem Those Hours. I also remind you,
that you can enjoy me works which will be on my first book free until the end
of the campaign  - https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vram69ei61mcg44/AACPT_BD41AonZ7hxXKlnU4-a?dl=0
. Introduction         Hello
everyone! As I have mentioned my name is Stoyko Rusev and I have been a writer
for a while now. In the next few lines I will give you some more details about
my work until now and my plans for the future.
The main goal of my campaign is to show my first book Blades
and Vicious Smiles to the world and gather money for the translation and
editing of the first 46 pages of my comic fantasy novel The Pyramid: A Prophecy
and my anti-utopian short stories based on diseases. For me it is very
important to receive feedback for my novel at this early stage of the creation
process, so I can upgrade it and eventually fulfill my dream to continue the legacy
of Terry Pratchett’s and Douglas Adams’ work.
The other project that I want to create is about my
anti-utopian short stories, and the main reason I want to bring them to the
world is because they, in my opinion, are a unique interpretation of our world
and have the potential to become a new branch of a very meaningful genre in
literature.
Your help will allow me show my projects to the world and
continue making good and meaningful works.
Where will your money go?
I will give you a brief description of the expenses for which
your donations will go:
1) 
Translation – The translation of the first 46
pages of my comic fantasy novel and of my 
anti-utopian short stories (11 pages) will cost me 786$ (152$ for the
short stories and 634$ for the novel.)
2) 
Editing – Their editing will cost me 114$ (22$
for the short stories and 92$ for the novel.)
3)  Fees – A 4% indiegogo fee (40$
approximately),  3,5% (35 $
approximately) for Paypal fees, 25$ single fee for the transfer of the donated
founds from credit cards to my bank account after the end of the campaign.
 Perks!
I am giving my first book Blades and Vicious smiles away trough
the campaign. I want everyone to be able to see what I am capable of and then
decide if they wants to be a part my dream.
If I complete my goal everyone will be able to enjoy and
download my works for 2 months.
I have a vision that every supporter should get a reward for
his help and I would implement it in my perks. I have observed many indiegogo
campaigns and I decided to make a little change in the system, so in my perks
you will see two differences:
1) 
I have a perks for every 10% progress of my goal
to all people who had given me their support.
2) 
If my campaign reaches it’s goal I will upload
my works for 60 days on my dropbox so everyone will be able to enjoy them, not
only the big contributors.
When will I be able to deliver perks?
1) 
I will need 5 to 7 days to send the
“introduction to the universe” perk.
2) 
For the “recite a miniature for you” perk I will
need 10 days to be able to give you the best experience possible and your
choice of a miniature.
3) 
For the unique short story for you I will need
10-15 days depending on how fast my translator and editor will be able to do
their job.
4) 
The collective perk “thank you for your support”
will be delivered 3 days after the first vote, one day for the gathering of
your votes and 2 days for my preparation for each  perk performance.
If I reach my goal I will upload the promised works in 30
days after the end of the campaign.
If I reach it earlier I will give my best to provide the
works as fast as I can.
 After I finish the
novel and if the anti-utopias develop into novellas or a novel, I will upload
them for free in Amazon for the first week after I self-publish them.
  
  When will I be
able to deliver the perks and what will I be able to deliver if my campaign
doesn’t reach it’s goal?
 If I don’t reach my
goal I will do my best to give back to you as much as possible,
for example for approximately 32$ I will be able to translate and edit one of
my short stories and upload it (for 174$ I will be able upload all of my  anti-utopian short stories). Beyond that mark
I will be able to deliver you a page for approximately every 16$.
Other goals I think I can achieve with my works:
I believe with my work I will not only be able to show my
work to the world, but inspire many other writers to give their works a chance
and follow my example showing them to the world. I have also ideas to help
other writers show their work to the world if I my campaign is successful.
I also want to be one of the reasons for more young adults to
grow a passion for reading.
Future plans
After the end of the campaign I will start sending my works
to literature magazines and publishing houses. I will also self-publish Blades
and Vicious Smiles in Amazon.
I will give my best to make the villain in my novel as
consistent as possible with modern physics and my anti-utopian short stories
feasible regarding the real diseases which had inspired them, because I want to
deliver a realistic reading experience.
Other ways to help me
If you want to contribute, but don’t have the resources,

<h3>What We Need From You</h3>
<p>As with any project, funding is an important detail. Taking a children's book from being just a dream to a high quality product is an expensive process. Our goal for Being Raven is $7500, which includes but doesn't fully cover...</p>
<ul>
<li>$5000 to pay our fantastically amazing illustrator, Nina Enagonio, Her art brings stories to life like no other, and I'm so pleased to be working with her for the second time. </li>
<li>$2500-$3500 to print the books for backers</li>
<li>$1750-$3500 for shipping supplies and shipping costs for sending out books</li>
<li>$500-$1500 to cover other rewards offered </li>
<li>$600+ in IndieGoGo platform costs, plus processing fees</li>
</ul>
<p>This brings our total costs to $9750-$13500. We'll be making up the difference by investing any profits from Kaylee's Bucket List toward producing Being Raven. To entice you, we've created a wide range of rewards, but if you can think of a reward combination that you don't see listed, please contact me and I can add it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every project has risks. Here are ours:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing delays - If our contracted printer has a delay, delivery may be delayed.</li>
<li>Health issues - If there were to be any major health issues with me, my family, or Nina, production could be slowed down. Unfortunately, this isn't avoidable, but we would work to keep all backers updated on progress.</li>

My Story
I am Stela Moldovanu and everywhere I go I am looking for beauty. Since I have discovered the meaning of the traditional Romanian blouse (named originally “IA”),  I fell in love with it. I have initiated the project MăiestrIA (”artistry”), the community that promotes the power of this artefact and its creators.
My project
Now, I am dreaming about a book, dedicated to IA. It is going to be the album of beauty, that will pass further into future the story and the craft that connects women and transforms them from consumers to creators.
I want it to be an exclusive, unique and collectible book. I see it full of stunning pictures and personal reflections of people that follow the tradition of sewing nowadays.
To make all this happen  I need your support. You can be a part of my dream by donating for this project. You can also share the campaign on social media and spread the word to your friends.

Si es que no nos conoces, en el siguiente video puedes escuchar algo de nuestra música, precisamente el demo del CD ""En Belén, a medianoche"", que grabamos las Discípulas de Jesús el año pasado. (Y por supuesto, también te invitamos a visitar nuestro canal de YouTube, donde encontrarás mucho más!!!).

Para llevar a cabo este proyecto editorial necesitamos reunir la cantidad de 3.000 dólares, que serán destinados a la reedición del libro Adviento y Noche Buena y a la grabación del CD con los cantos de Adviento y Navidad que el libro contiene.
No somos una empresa con fines de lucro, razón por la cual todas las ganancias de nuestras producciones están destinadas a seguir produciendo otros proyectos para la extensión del Reino de Dios.
Agradecemos de antemano tu ayuda. Si puedes apoyarnos económicamente, a continuación puedes ver los beneficios que obtendrás según tu aportación.

Compártela en tus redes, pero principalmente de manera personal, contándole a tus familiares y amigos que creas que puedan estar interesados en apoyar este tipo de iniciativas. Cada colaboración suma, y no hay aportes pequeños. Lo importante es que se empiece a correr la voz.
Y por supuesto, siempre nos encomendamos a tu oración, ya que estamos convencidas de que esta es la mejor y más grande ayuda que podemos recibir. Con tu intercesión estamos seguras de que el Señor abrirá puertas y allanará los caminos para que este proyecto se pueda llevar a cabo según su voluntad y cumpla la misión que Él quiere. Solo Él conoce lo que hará a través de este libro y estos cantos de Adviento y Villancicos. Por eso ponemos desde ya todo este trabajo en sus manos y se lo consagramos a Él.

I miss the sounds of the trains rolling in
Our bodies draped so casually close together


The smell of vodka on your breath,
as your chest heaves up and down


Sloppily, messily in love with your cyan eyes
Your multicolored hair stuck to your forehead, drenched in sweat


They call us names, maybe, but I don’t mind
Confirming exactly what I’m feeling in the moment


You sob into my shoulder, the stigma,
becoming much too much of a burden to bear


I whisper into your ear, softly cooing
That you will rise up to see another day,
rum buzzing on my tongue

<h2>Junga books are a great way to have important life-lesson discussions with children. The Junga book series aims to reduce bullying for children K-3rd grade. </h2>
<p><strong>Would you like to teach children the importance of having courage, empathy, and positive self esteem?</strong></p>
<p>Children with low self-esteem, anxiety, depression or similar issues are at a higher risk of suicide. The bullying of these children may be the tipping point to tragedy. According to stopbullying.gov, 160,000 students stay home from school every day to avoid bullies, 1 out of 4 children are bullied either through cyber, mental, verbal or physical methods and 64% of victims never even report the incidents. We must continue to find new ways to reach young children and give them hope and encouragement while dealing with bullying.</p>
<p>Children will enjoy reading the stories over and over as Junga and friends face challenges while learning valuable life lessons such as developing acceptance, bravery, and courage. The Junga book series also teaches lessons about doing the right thing, finding the good in others, having a positive self-image, and overcoming bullying.</p>
<p><i><strong>*****BE SURE TO VIEW THE TAB FOR IMPORTANT UPDATES FOR INFORMATION ON ENDORSEMENTS AND HOW TO HAVE A CHARACTER CALL YOUR FAMILY FOR THE HOLIDAYS!</strong></i></p>
<h3>Educational Tools</h3>
<p>Our team of Early Childhood Development Educators is creating age-appropriate Lesson Plans to assist educators and parents to help their children learn these important lessons.</p>
<p>With your help, we can produce and share ""Junga the Dancing Yeti Meets Heidi"" with children around the world and help end bullying, one child or class at a time. The first Junga the Dancing Yeti book is currently available at Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble and other stores and is receiving rave reviews! </p>
<h3>YouTube Video</h3>
<p>Watch the Trailer video of the first Junga book here: <a href=""https://youtu.be/IdPbONnqSk4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Junga the Dancing Yeti Trailer</a>.

We plan to produce a video of the new book as well and <strong>Executive and Associate Producers </strong>of this Indiegogo Campaign will receive recognition in the upcoming book and video for Junga the Dancing Yeti Meets Heidi.  <a href=""https://youtu.be/MclbU7BjJHs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Junga the Dancing Yeti Video</a></p>
<p>Children in the USA, Ireland and Scotland have enjoyed the author's live readings of how Junga overcame discrimination and bullying. The second book introduces Heidi who becomes Junga's close friend and together they find a way to end being targets of a persistent bully. Children learn a powerful lesson where the creation of new friendships can help to overcome adversary.</p>
<h2>Here is our plan to action:</h2>
<h3>Media Coverage</h3>
<p>Since bullying and discrimination are timely topics, author Stephen Tako has been interviewed on many talk show platforms since 2012. He was the featured speaker recently on <a href=""https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1248-life-without-limits-45796960/episode/stephentako-talk-54142517/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iHeart Radio: Life Without Limits</a>, England's Beacon of Light Radio - Over the Rainbow with host Bob Brown and a guest on Next Level by Association with Bob Donnell.

<h2>About the Author:</h2>
<p>Stephen Tako is a member of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators as well as a member of SAG-AFTRA. As an anti-bullying advocate, he has interviewed children and adults on his talk show, who were victims of various types of bullying. He's interviewed therapists, sports celebrities and even former bullies, in his quest to help people overcome the negative impact of being bullied. </p>
<p>""The strong desire to save children from committing suicide has grown tremendously within me. I developed Junga the Dancing Yeti to teach children about courage, acceptance and love,"" said Tako. ""I too was a target of bullies and wrote about it in my book Motivated to Act (pub. Enchanted Forest Press 2012) in the chapter A Damaged Child.""</p>
<p>As a Competent Toastmaster, he has spoken to thousands over the last 20 years on topics such as self-esteem improvement, overcoming limiting beliefs, anti-bullying, becoming a more effective speaker and more.  </p>
<p>Stephen was the producer and casting director for the Junga the Dancing Yeti video. ""We had an amazing team of voiceover artists, combined with Emmy-quality editing to bring Peter Gullerud's illustrations to life"" said Tako during a recent interview.</p>
<p>Raised in Ohio, Stephen moved to Los Angeles in 1987 to work in entertainment. His path took him in the direction of sales in various industries, including his current position as a mortgage lender. Besides mortgages, he currently host various international film festivals in Hollywood as well as publishing and producing all the Junga books and videos. He met his fiance while visiting family in Ohio and moved there briefly, before relocating to San Diego, California. </p>
<h2>About the Illustrator:</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599066343/b8v4xg3oneuop8jjveis.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Peter Gullerud</p>
<p>Peter Gullerud’s expressive detail and technical gifts have been employed at the three top animation studios in Los Angeles: Hanna-Barbera, Disney Features and Warner Brothers Features. He rose up the chain at Disney becoming one of two prestigious visual development artists on the hit film Aladdin. After that, he remained a visual development artist on the Warner Brothers films Space Jam, Quest for Camelot and The Iron Giant.</p>
<p>Peter is a self taught artist who presents a captivating and unique perspective in his works. His varied subject matter includes surreal landscapes, unique buildings, animated figures and tenderly portrayed wildlife. Many of his works have a mysterious story telling quality about them which allows the viewer to go on a personal imaginary journey. He uses oils and acrylics in his canvas paintings as well as a unique mixture of media in his drawings. His works suggest an unusual mix of elements reminiscent of Edvard Munch, van Gogh, Maynard Dixon, and Roger Dean along with his own unique surreal and expressive brush strokes.</p>
<p>After 15 years of studio work, Gullerud began working directly with wildlife. He brings to his work the authenticity of working with Wildlife Educators and Tippi Hedren’s animals at the Shambala Preserve. He has hands-on experiences with Siberian tigers, California black bears, binturongs, pigtail macaques, African elephants, wolves and many other exotics. After Peter’s wildlife period, he began painting surrealist landscapes and continues to do that to this day. His paintings display a boundless imagination and storytelling ability that draws you into his works. As you are drawn in, you often discover surprising, hidden details within the picture that make a statement about our humanity, our planet and and the other beings we share it with. Some of the other creatures are totally original and reside solely within the surreal world of Peter’s imagination.</p>
<p>In addition to his paintings, Peter is an accomplished illustrator creating many imaginative and whimsical drawings in his own unique fashion using ink, pencil and other media.</p>
<p>Peter Gullerud was born in Wisconsin and moved to California where he has spent most of his life. He resided in the quaint village of Pine Mountain Club, CA in the Los Padres National Forest where he was introduced to author Stephen Tako and began collaborating on Junga, the Dancing Yeti. He lived there for many years where his works were displayed in local businesses and sold throughout the country. Peter now resides in Taft, CA, another quaint town. Peter displays a concern for environmental issues and a compassion for all animals as evidenced in his works. He remains a member of the Animators Guild of America.</p>

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>The book is completely written. The artwork will change on some of the rewards as the illustrator cleans up edges on existing artwork. Plus as the production develops, we will likely come up with a couple new images to use on some of the products used for backer rewards. The Courage Certificate and Heidi Poster shown here are only prototypes. Final designs will be announced later. Due to the timely nature of this campaign against bullying, we are confident that we will reach our funding goals. Teaming up with former Disney artist Peter Gullerud for illustrations is another guarantee that we will deliver a top-quality children's book. We will provide updates regularly along the process to all of our backers.</p>
</div></div>","Junga books are a great way to have important life-lesson discussions with children. The Junga book series aims to reduce bullying for children K-3rd grade. 
Would you like to teach children the importance of having courage, empathy, and positive self esteem?
Children with low self-esteem, anxiety, depression or similar issues are at a higher risk of suicide. The bullying of these children may be the tipping point to tragedy. According to stopbullying.gov, 160,000 students stay home from school every day to avoid bullies, 1 out of 4 children are bullied either through cyber, mental, verbal or physical methods and 64% of victims never even report the incidents. We must continue to find new ways to reach young children and give them hope and encouragement while dealing with bullying.
Children will enjoy reading the stories over and over as Junga and friends face challenges while learning valuable life lessons such as developing acceptance, bravery, and courage. The Junga book series also teaches lessons about doing the right thing, finding the good in others, having a positive self-image, and overcoming bullying.
*****BE SURE TO VIEW THE TAB FOR IMPORTANT UPDATES FOR INFORMATION ON ENDORSEMENTS AND HOW TO HAVE A CHARACTER CALL YOUR FAMILY FOR THE HOLIDAYS!
Educational Tools
Our team of Early Childhood Development Educators is creating age-appropriate Lesson Plans to assist educators and parents to help their children learn these important lessons.
With your help, we can produce and share ""Junga the Dancing Yeti Meets Heidi"" with children around the world and help end bullying, one child or class at a time. The first Junga the Dancing Yeti book is currently available at Amazon, Barnes & Noble and other stores and is receiving rave reviews! 
YouTube Video
Watch the Trailer video of the first Junga book here: Junga the Dancing Yeti Trailer. We brought together a professional cast of voiceover artists along with the talented 11-time Emmy Recipient James R. Alburger to create a video of Junga the Dancing Yeti on YouTube. We plan to produce a video of the new book as well and Executive and Associate Producers of this Indiegogo Campaign will receive recognition in the upcoming book and video for Junga the Dancing Yeti Meets Heidi.  Junga the Dancing Yeti Video
Children in the USA, Ireland and Scotland have enjoyed the author's live readings of how Junga overcame discrimination and bullying. The second book introduces Heidi who becomes Junga's close friend and together they find a way to end being targets of a persistent bully. Children learn a powerful lesson where the creation of new friendships can help to overcome adversary.
Here is our plan to action:
Media Coverage
Since bullying and discrimination are timely topics, author Stephen Tako has been interviewed on many talk show platforms since 2012. He was the featured speaker recently on iHeart Radio: Life Without Limits, England's Beacon of Light Radio - Over the Rainbow with host Bob Brown and a guest on Next Level by Association with Bob Donnell. Stephen is the September, 2020 guest speaker at the Santa Clarita Rotary Club and their Hometown Station KHTS interviewed Stephen in 2018. Also, while visiting his hometown in Ohio, the local paper wrote an article about his work.

About the Author:
Stephen Tako is a member of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators as well as a member of SAG-AFTRA. As an anti-bullying advocate, he has interviewed children and adults on his talk show, who were victims of various types of bullying. He's interviewed therapists, sports celebrities and even former bullies, in his quest to help people overcome the negative impact of being bullied. 
""The strong desire to save children from committing suicide has grown tremendously within me. I developed Junga the Dancing Yeti to teach children about courage, acceptance and love,"" said Tako. ""I too was a target of bullies and wrote about it in my book Motivated to Act (pub. Enchanted Forest Press 2012) in the chapter A Damaged Child.""
As a Competent Toastmaster, he has spoken to thousands over the last 20 years on topics such as self-esteem improvement, overcoming limiting beliefs, anti-bullying, becoming a more effective speaker and more.  
Stephen was the producer and casting director for the Junga the Dancing Yeti video. ""We had an amazing team of voiceover artists, combined with Emmy-quality editing to bring Peter Gullerud's illustrations to life"" said Tako during a recent interview.
Raised in Ohio, Stephen moved to Los Angeles in 1987 to work in entertainment. His path took him in the direction of sales in various industries, including his current position as a mortgage lender. Besides mortgages, he currently host various international film festivals in Hollywood as well as publishing and producing all the Junga books and videos. He met his fiance while visiting family in Ohio and moved there briefly, before relocating to San Diego, California. 
About the Illustrator:

Peter Gullerud
Peter Gullerud’s expressive detail and technical gifts have been employed at the three top animation studios in Los Angeles: Hanna-Barbera, Disney Features and Warner Brothers Features. He rose up the chain at Disney becoming one of two prestigious visual development artists on the hit film Aladdin. After that, he remained a visual development artist on the Warner Brothers films Space Jam, Quest for Camelot and The Iron Giant.
Peter is a self taught artist who presents a captivating and unique perspective in his works. His varied subject matter includes surreal landscapes, unique buildings, animated figures and tenderly portrayed wildlife. Many of his works have a mysterious story telling quality about them which allows the viewer to go on a personal imaginary journey. He uses oils and acrylics in his canvas paintings as well as a unique mixture of media in his drawings. His works suggest an unusual mix of elements reminiscent of Edvard Munch, van Gogh, Maynard Dixon, and Roger Dean along with his own unique surreal and expressive brush strokes.
After 15 years of studio work, Gullerud began working directly with wildlife. He brings to his work the authenticity of working with Wildlife Educators and Tippi Hedren’s animals at the Shambala Preserve. He has hands-on experiences with Siberian tigers, California black bears, binturongs, pigtail macaques, African elephants, wolves and many other exotics. After Peter’s wildlife period, he began painting surrealist landscapes and continues to do that to this day. His paintings display a boundless imagination and storytelling ability that draws you into his works. As you are drawn in, you often discover surprising, hidden details within the picture that make a statement about our humanity, our planet and and the other beings we share it with. Some of the other creatures are totally original and reside solely within the surreal world of Peter’s imagination.
In addition to his paintings, Peter is an accomplished illustrator creating many imaginative and whimsical drawings in his own unique fashion using ink, pencil and other media.
Peter Gullerud was born in Wisconsin and moved to California where he has spent most of his life. He resided in the quaint village of Pine Mountain Club, CA in the Los Padres National Forest where he was introduced to author Stephen Tako and began collaborating on Junga, the Dancing Yeti. He lived there for many years where his works were displayed in local businesses and sold throughout the country. Peter now resides in Taft, CA, another quaint town. Peter displays a concern for environmental issues and a compassion for all animals as evidenced in his works. He remains a member of the Animators Guild of America.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm Camilla Howalt I'm a visual artist and writer..<br/> </p>
<p><i>T H E     S T O R Y</i></p>
<p>WE ARE TIME (Vi Er Tiden in Danish) is a philosophical fiction that examines what reality is and how, through different layers of consciousness, it puts into perspective the possibility of simultaneous existences, as well as the transition between these. It is a book that tries to take as its starting point the abstract language of the body and mind, and give ithis a form.</p>
<p><i>S T O R Y     I N S P I R A T I O N</i></p>
<p>Throughout my life I have travelled to different places in the world, and in my mind. As my writing has progressed, so have my understanding of the magic that can happen on a page. WE ARE THE TIME is an examination of this magic.</p>
<p><i>A B O U T        T H E         A R T I S T</i></p>
<p>As an artist and writer I tend to weave and map elements from external life and from the inside of what has turned out to be me. I take bits and pieces, like mental snapshots, of everything that happens around me and in the wider world, translating these intuitions and observations into my favourite materials.</p>
<p>These I weave around one another like figures in a myth or words in a concept - philosophical or psychoanalytical - like a caterpillar winding a silky thread around itself until fully cocooned, biding time until, without warning, the work bursts forth like a butterfly. Each piece carries beauty and integrity - its own qualities that I could not consciously impart. The work becomes as a result of leaving myself open to bridging being with doing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>What I Need</i></p>
<p>In order to complete WE ARE THE TIME, I need your help! WE ARE THE TIME will be printed as an 14 x 21 cm, high-quality, softcover book. Your generous contributions will go towards several aspects of the editing process, design and layout, printing, and publishing process.</p>

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<p><i>They Were a Dream</i> is a story about trauma and the devistating effects it can have on mental health, but also about healing and the fantastic things that can come from recovering.<br/><br/>My name is Trii Tyle, and I am the author of <i>They Were a Dream</i>. I wrote this book because of a traumatic situation I experienced, the denial I was in for years afterwards, the night terrors and panic induced from the trauma, the beauty of healing and therapy, as well as the fantastical aspect of astral projection and falling in love.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the broader aspects of dreams and recovery. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with nonbinary gender themes while escaping from the binds of reality and learning about trauma recovery through the eyes of someone experiencing it.</p>
<p><br/>The world of this book is shown through the eyes of the protagonist, Ellery. She has incredibly vivid nightmares of the trauma that she experienced, and she has no idea how to help herself. She leans on poetry, her cat named Lion, and her best friend Samar for support as she suffers through panic and anxiety. Her life is filled with terror until she’s introduced to therapy. Ellery finds healing through talk therapy and can finally sleep peacefully again. Her nightmares fade and soon turn into something significantly more fantastical, until she experiences the most spectacular dreams of her life in the most remarkable places and with the most breathtaking person she had ever met.<br/><br/><br/><strong>FOR ALL:</strong><br/>You will love this book if you are seeking an escape from the anxieties of reality, tired of the gender binaries that society imprints, and are interested in the idea of multiple dimensions.<br/><br/><i>They Were a Dream</i> speaks to the trauma survivors and the LGBTQIA+ community who want to grapple with the gray areas of society and therapeutic recovery in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>They Were a Dream</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does trauma escalate in the mind when not treated?</li>
<li>What if there are more dimensions or realities than just the one we are experiencing?</li>
<li>Why does society force a distinguished difference between genders?</li>
</ul>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing nonbinary, trauma recovery, and multiple dimensions will change us all for the better.<br/><br/> <p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April, 2021.</li>
<li>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this spring.</li>
</ul>
<br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</li>
<li>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.</li>

<li>You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.</li>
<li>You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.</li>

</div></div>","Story of My Book
They Were a Dream is a story about trauma and the devistating effects it can have on mental health, but also about healing and the fantastic things that can come from recovering.My name is Trii Tyle, and I am the author of They Were a Dream. I wrote this book because of a traumatic situation I experienced, the denial I was in for years afterwards, the night terrors and panic induced from the trauma, the beauty of healing and therapy, as well as the fantastical aspect of astral projection and falling in love.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the broader aspects of dreams and recovery. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with nonbinary gender themes while escaping from the binds of reality and learning about trauma recovery through the eyes of someone experiencing it.
The world of this book is shown through the eyes of the protagonist, Ellery. She has incredibly vivid nightmares of the trauma that she experienced, and she has no idea how to help herself. She leans on poetry, her cat named Lion, and her best friend Samar for support as she suffers through panic and anxiety. Her life is filled with terror until she’s introduced to therapy. Ellery finds healing through talk therapy and can finally sleep peacefully again. Her nightmares fade and soon turn into something significantly more fantastical, until she experiences the most spectacular dreams of her life in the most remarkable places and with the most breathtaking person she had ever met.FOR ALL:You will love this book if you are seeking an escape from the anxieties of reality, tired of the gender binaries that society imprints, and are interested in the idea of multiple dimensions.They Were a Dream speaks to the trauma survivors and the LGBTQIA+ community who want to grapple with the gray areas of society and therapeutic recovery in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that They Were a Dream inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:

How does trauma escalate in the mind when not treated?
What if there are more dimensions or realities than just the one we are experiencing?
Why does society force a distinguished difference between genders?
I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing nonbinary, trauma recovery, and multiple dimensions will change us all for the better. What I Need & What You'll Get This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:
The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April, 2021.

The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.

When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

<i>Ari Barak and the Choice Paradox</i>!</p><p>The old Rabbi lay propped up with pillows on his deathbed, smiling serenely.  His children and several of his older grandchildren were gathered around.  Tears glistened in their eyes.  Tears of laughter. </p><p>“Abba, you really are unbelievable,” wheezed Gavriel, his eldest son, recovering long enough from his conniptions to speak.  He himself was in his late sixties.  “One might think that when a nonagenarian <i>gadol hador<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>[1]</strong></a></i> passes away, he might do it gracefully, with gravitas and maybe some deep wisdom in his parting words.  But you’ve done nothing but have us splitting our sides for the last half hour!”</p><p>“Good,” pronounced the old man in a creaky voice.  “If there should be anything that you will remember me by, it’s that I was never too old to have a sense of humor.”</p><p>“But Abba<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[2]</a>,” protested his daughter Avigail, “you should rest!  Aren’t you in pain?  Can’t I give you some pain killers?”</p><p>“Of course I’m in pain!” replied her father.  “The cancer is consuming me.  I can feel the <i>Beis Din shel Maala<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>[3]</strong></a></i> calling me.  But you think I should spend my last few minutes in this world drugged out, unable to feel, think, or be present with those I love?  <i>Chas veshalom<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>[4]</strong></a>!</i>  The pain is temporary!”  He winced.  “But this time now is irreplaceable!”</p><p>He turned to another of his sons.  “Speaking of which, Uriel, has the Doctor arrived yet?  I need to speak to him.”</p><p>“I’ll check, Abba.”  He shuffled over to the door and poked his head outside, then called back in.  “Yes, Abba, he’s here.  Shall I bring him in?”</p><p>“No, I think he’s quite capable of walking in by himself,” called back the old Rabbi dryly.  His offspring burst out laughing again, several wiping their eyes as the uproar died down.</p><p>In walked a thin, neat man of around sixty.  He surveyed the gathering with a wry smile.  “Well, this certainly is the most cheerful farewell I’ve ever seen.  But laughter is the best medicine, after all, isn’t it?  Rebbe<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[5]</a>, you sent for me?”</p><p>“Yes, Doctor, I did.  I have something important to tell you that is for your ears only.”</p><p>A curious and awkward silence descended over the room.  The old man looked around at his family.  “I’m sorry, am I slurring my speech?  I said, what I have to say now is for the Doctor’s ears only.  Go on, now.”  He motioned feebly with his hand to usher everyone out.</p><p>“But… Abba…” protested Gavriel.</p><p>“Oh, <i>feh</i>, don’t worry,” he waved dismissively.  “I’ll keep myself alive until you get back.  Trust me, you’ll get your chance to say goodbye.  But now I must have private words with the Doctor.”</p><p>Reluctantly, his offspring trudged out of the room and closed the door behind themselves.  The Doctor sat himself in an upright chair near the head of the bed.</p><p>“I knew you would come,” said the aged Rabbi.</p><p>“It was fortunate that I was able to be here now.  I just got back from speaking at a conference in London, and only have a day at home now before the next one in Singapore.”</p><p>“And yet, I knew with complete certainty that I would see you again before I die.  I cannot <i>allow</i> myself to die yet.  Not until I have entrusted you with a sacred mission.”</p><p>The Doctor leaned closer, brows furrowed.  “A sacred mission, Rebbe?”</p><p>“Yes.  I could be dramatic and say the whole world depends on it.  But it doesn’t matter what I say, because I know you will do it anyway.  And, all going well, you could even be back here before I shuffle off this mortal coil, to tell me you succeeded.  But even if not, I know you will succeed.”</p><p>“Thank you for your confidence in me, Rebbe – I <i>think</i>.”  The Doctor raised an eyebrow.  “What is this mission?”</p><p>“I wrote it down for you.  Look in the top drawer of my bedside table.  There’s an envelope there, addressed to you.”</p><p>The Doctor obediently opened the drawer and found the envelope.  He tore it open and scanned the note inside.  As he read it, he blanched.  His eyes widened in disbelief, and his jaw dropped.</p><p>“Rebbe… are you… <i>serious</i>?  This is… quite, ah… how shall I say it?  <i>Unexpected?</i>”</p><p>“Much of the time, my dear Doctor, I am not too serious.  My cancer is very serious, so I do have to counterbalance it.  But on this occasion, I am <i>dead</i> serious.  Which is appropriate for someone who is soon to be seriously dead.”</p><p>The Doctor shook his head, blinking, breathing deeply, coming to terms with his task and all it entailed.  After about half a minute of reflection, he looked the dying man in the eyes.  “Rebbe… you never told me…”</p><p>The old man nodded weakly, a smile playing on his lips.  “It wasn’t necessary before.  But it is true, and now you know what you have to do.”</p><p>“My wife…” the Doctor mumbled, still in shock.</p><p>“You need to do this alone,” instructed the Rabbi.  “Mostly.  The Professor will help you as necessary.  Don’t worry about your wife; she won’t miss you.  You’ll be back within the hour, anyway, possibly sooner, depending on how good your aim is.”  He gave a conspiratorial wink, then winced involuntary in pain.</p><p>The Doctor took a deep breath, composed himself and stood up.  “Of course I will do it, Rebbe.  Right away.”</p><p>The old man’s face lit up.  “Good man.  I knew you would.”</p><p>“Apparently so,” replied the Doctor dryly.</p><p>“One more thing,” said the Rabbi.  “Please give me that little notepad and a pen.”</p><p>The Doctor obeyed, holding the notepad upright in the old man’s lap with one hand, and helping him grip the pen in the other.  With limp movements, the dying Rabbi scrawled a sentence on the pad, then tore off the page and handed it to the Doctor with a mischievous smile.</p><p>The Doctor accepted it with a raised eyebrow.  “I could have made one myself, you know.”</p><p>“I know,” said the Rabbi with a twinkle in his eye.  “But I couldn’t resist.  By the time you get back you’ll understand why.”</p><p>“All right, I’ll take your word for it,” replied the Doctor, folding the note along with his instructions and tucking them into his pocket.  He turned as if to leave, then paused for a couple of seconds, took a deep breath and turned back.  “Rebbe, this is an unbelievable honor for me.  Of all your <i>talmidim<a href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>[6]</strong></a></i>, why me?  I’m certainly not the biggest <i>talmid chacham<a href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>[7]</strong></a></i>…”</p><p>The Rabbi smiled a knowing smile, but did not reply.</p><p>“Of course,” said his student, divining the answer himself.  “It has to be me.  I understand.  Well then, farewell for now.  And thank you – for <i>everything</i>.”</p><p>“No,” said the old man.  “Thank <i>you</i>.  What you are about to do means my <i>life</i> to me.”</p><p>He held out his hand.  As the Doctor took it, the old man pulled him with surprising strength into a tight embrace.  He only released his grip when the pain from his body forced him.</p><p>Without another word, the Doctor bowed his head, then turned and strode purposefully from the room.</p><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%""/>

<h3>Why This Book?</h3>
<p>You get asked to help fund a lot of projects. In some cases your heartstrings get tugged and you feel good helping. In some cases you believe in the product. You think it is cool. You want it for yourself.</p>
<p>In some ways this book is both.</p>
<p><strong>You might be a small business owner</strong> with an advertising budget that doesn't seem to reach as far as you would like. You might feel like famed retailer John Wanamaker who said, <i>""Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted. The trouble is I don't know which half.""</i> You might feel overwhelmed by all the advertising sales people out there trying to convince you that they have the perfect market for your goods and services. You might be reading blogs and articles about all the newfangled ways you can advertise, about what is the hot new trend, wondering if you need to move your ad dollars there.</p>
<p><strong>Let me tell you a little secret.</strong> Most advertising sales people don't know how to use their own product. Sure, they know how to <i>sell </i>it. They don't know how to <i>use </i>it. They only know how others have used it, so they create ads for you that look just like everyone else. Do you really want to look like everyone else?</p>
<p>I know this. I ran a giant, independent retail store for over 20 years. I worked with these salespeople for decades. I spent millions of dollars on advertising, some of it poorly. I had to learn these lessons on my own. I studied with some really smart people. I used these new principles in my own business, testing and modifying as I went along. Now many of those same advertising salespeople from before ask me to teach them what I know.</p>
<p><strong>Let me tell you another little secret.</strong> It doesn't matter what media you use. It does matter what you say. This book helps you focus on your message and shows you how to deliver that message in a way that moves people toward your products and services. This book teaches you six principles that you won't find in any other book on advertising (I know, I've read tons of them.)</p>
<p><strong>You might not be a small business owner</strong> with an advertising budget. You still want this book printed and published. You've watched your favorite local stores close their doors. You keep thinking, <i>""if only more people knew about them, they would still be here.""</i> You did your part. You told all your friends. But it wasn't enough.</p>
<p>This book is for them. It will help them (and you) spread the word more powerfully and effectively. This little book will help keep independent, locally owned businesses open - with your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Your Money Will Do</h3>
<p>This is my third book. I know what it costs to do a book right. You do, too. You know a good book starts with great content, written clearly. But there is more than just content. You know a good book is edited for clarity of ideas, edited for proper grammar and punctuation and spelling, edited for continuity and language. You know a good book is formatted properly to look professional on the page. You know a good book will be available in digital as well as print formats. You know a good book has a professionally designed cover that grabs your attention. You know people do judge books by their cover, by their formatting, and by the professionalism of the way they are printed.</p>
<p>Editing, design, formatting, and printing all cost money. So does marketing.</p>
<p>Your support will go to pay for those services. Your support will help get this book launched in front of as many people as possible.</p>
<h3>Here is What's In It for You...</h3>
<p>Everyone who supports this campaign will get a signed copy of the book. The perks I am offering make it more than a donation. You're buying my products and services (often at discounted prices). </p>
<p>One perk of incredible value is that I'll help you write ads for your business the way I wrote sample ads for eight other businesses in the book.</p>
<p>Another perk will get you a live webinar for you and your friends. I could even be compelled to stop by and visit for some one-on-one consulting or a daylong workshop for you and anyone you wish to invite. (See <a href=""http://philsforum.com/retail-speaker/speaker-topics"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://philsforum.com/retail-speaker/speaker-topics</a> for topics.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>This Book Will Change Lives</h3>
<p>Okay, that may seem like a bold and brash statement. But think about it... If one small business survives and grows because of this book, you've helped them <i>and </i>their family <i>and</i> their employees <i>and</i> their community. Multiply that times 100 or 1000 and you can see the power this book can have.</p>
<p>I don't have to tell you all the studies that show how locally-owned businesses are better for a community economically. You've seen those reports. This book won't be read by huge chain stores and major brands. It won't be read by Madison Avenue advertising agencies. (Although it should.) It will be read by local mom &amp; pop shops, local service providers, and local agencies that work with these folks.</p>
<p>Your support helps the little guys take on Goliath and succeed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>This Book Will Launch With or Without You (But I Want You On Board)</h3>
<p>The book is written. The book is in the editing process. I have enough money to pay the editor and the cover designer. My problem is that because of some big changes in my life the last few months I am short of cash to do the rest.</p>
<p>With your help I will be able to get this book printed and uploaded digitally by mid-June with a marketing campaign behind it. Together, you and I will be helping small businesses everywhere.</p>
<p>Without your help, it may be several months before the book is finished. But it will get done. Okay, maybe that isn't a compelling, powerful pitch to help convince you to donate. I only tell you this so that you know whether this campaign hits the goal or not, this book is launching. </p>
<p>I want you on board to help me. The more money we raise, the sooner we can get this book into the hands of businesses who really need it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe you can't support financially right now. I understand. You can still help. Here are some other things you can do...</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign with your favorite locally owned businesses.</li>
<li>Share this on your social media platforms.</li>
<li>Share this with business leaders and organizations like your Chamber of Commerce, Downtown Development Authority, Main Street Program, and Economic Development team.</li>
<li>Share this with your local ad salespeople. Tell your local radio and television stations about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indiegogo has some cool sharing tools to help you spread the word.</p>

<h3>Acerca de El Bujero.</h3>
<p>El Bujero es una novela de ficción al cien por cien, pero que hunde sus raíces en la forma de vida de un tiempo y un lugar que son totalmente reales.</p>
<p>También algunos de los personajes que se nombran en el libro, siempre de pasada y sin ningún tipo de protagonismo en la historia, son reales, son personas que han existido o existen aún, y que han dejado su huella en la historia de un pueblo por otra parte cargado de historia y de historias.</p>

<p>Greetings, earthlings! My name is Cameron Drury, and I'm just an ordinary businessman by day who decided to write a novel by night. It's about pet ferrets who become self-aware, and go on a hilariously absurd mission to make their dreams come true: Land on the moon and trek amongst the cosmos!</p>
<p>I'm launching this campaign to make my own dream come true: <strong>To turn this passion project of mine into a paperback book that both kids and adults can enjoy for years to come.</strong></p>
<p>My hope is that by your help and support, I can get this story out to you and the world. I am genuinely proud of this tale, and I believe it will inspire you, make you cry of laughter, warm your heart, creep you out, and keep you on the edge of your seat!</p>

<p>It’s July 4, 2026, the 250<sup>th</sup> birthday of the United States of America! Thousands of people watching fireworks along the Missouri River near Mandan and Bismarck, North Dakota, get a huge surprise at the end of the fireworks display. A beautifully-lit old steamboat<i> </i>slowly moves past them on the Missouri River. Amazingly, it’s the <i>Far West</i> steamboat, once piloted by Captain Grant Marsh. It had traveled this same route coming back from the Battle of the Little Big Horn with wounded 150 years earlier in 1876—when the United States had just finished celebrating its 100<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p>
<p>This begins a mystery, with lots of history, involving the life of the greatest steamboatman in history—Captain Grant Marsh! Numerous historical photos and illustrations add to this adventure.</p>

<p>Kremer grew up in Mandan, North Dakota, and he loves to write books involving that area. He also likes to include his favorite places in Mandan and Bismarck in his writing—including Ohm’s Cafe and A&amp;B Pizza.</p>

<p>Mit navn er Diana Lund.</p>
<p>Min kæreste som jeg bor sammen med har sclerose og jeg mistede min far til kræft i sommeren 2018.</p>
<p><strong><i>Jeg har besluttet mig for at skrive en bog om det at være pårørende, da rigtig mange pårørende glemmer sig selv i forbindelse med svære sygdomsforløb. </i></strong></p>
<p>Det kan være rigtig hårdt, grundet de mange praktiske ting, som er forbundet med det at have en syg tæt på sig. For ikke at nævne det store psykiske pres, som kan blive så stort at pårørende <strong>desværre rammes af sygdomme som stress og depression</strong>.</p>
<p>Bogen handler netop om at være pårørende, og jeg fortæller naturligvis min egen historie, men jeg har også været ude og interviewe andre pårørende, som har det helt tæt inde på livet, og som har måttet træffe mange tunge og svære valg undervejs.</p>
<p>Det bliver desuden <strong>en bog med gode råd til hvordan vi som pårørende passer på os selv i en hård proces</strong>. For det er desværre ofte svært at vide hvor man skal henvende sig for at få hjælp, og ofte også at få hjælpen, før man selv bliver syg.</p>
<p>Faktum er at 1 ud af 3 danskere får kræft inden de fylder 75, ca. 16.000 danskere har sclerose, 50.000 har epilepsi og omkring 75.000 lider af en spiseforstyrrelse. Bag dem står de pårørende, så problemet er ægte, og noget <strong>vi er nødt til at forholde os til</strong>.</p>
<p>For at kunne producere bogen har jeg valgt at gøre brug af crowdfunding. Det betyder at du som privatperson, eller firma, kan støtte/forudbestille bogen og andre relaterede ting som f.eks. foredrag. Bogen leveres når den udkommer i efteråret 2019.</p>
<p>Målet er at samle 78.000 kr sammen. Det dækker 53.000 kr til korrektur, grafisk arbejde og opsætning af bogen, 19.000 kr til tryk af 500 bøger, samt 6.000 kr til markedsføring.</p>
<p>Jeg håber du vil hjælpe mig med at sprede dette meget vigtige budskab. Kontakt mig gerne ved spørgsmål eller for uddybende info.</p>
<p>Mvh Diana Lund</p>

Min kæreste som jeg bor sammen med har sclerose og jeg mistede min far til kræft i sommeren 2018.
Jeg har besluttet mig for at skrive en bog om det at være pårørende, da rigtig mange pårørende glemmer sig selv i forbindelse med svære sygdomsforløb. 
Det kan være rigtig hårdt, grundet de mange praktiske ting, som er forbundet med det at have en syg tæt på sig. For ikke at nævne det store psykiske pres, som kan blive så stort at pårørende desværre rammes af sygdomme som stress og depression.
Bogen handler netop om at være pårørende, og jeg fortæller naturligvis min egen historie, men jeg har også været ude og interviewe andre pårørende, som har det helt tæt inde på livet, og som har måttet træffe mange tunge og svære valg undervejs.
Det bliver desuden en bog med gode råd til hvordan vi som pårørende passer på os selv i en hård proces. For det er desværre ofte svært at vide hvor man skal henvende sig for at få hjælp, og ofte også at få hjælpen, før man selv bliver syg.
Faktum er at 1 ud af 3 danskere får kræft inden de fylder 75, ca. 16.000 danskere har sclerose, 50.000 har epilepsi og omkring 75.000 lider af en spiseforstyrrelse. Bag dem står de pårørende, så problemet er ægte, og noget vi er nødt til at forholde os til.
For at kunne producere bogen har jeg valgt at gøre brug af crowdfunding. Det betyder at du som privatperson, eller firma, kan støtte/forudbestille bogen og andre relaterede ting som f.eks. foredrag. Bogen leveres når den udkommer i efteråret 2019.
Målet er at samle 78.000 kr sammen. Det dækker 53.000 kr til korrektur, grafisk arbejde og opsætning af bogen, 19.000 kr til tryk af 500 bøger, samt 6.000 kr til markedsføring.
Jeg håber du vil hjælpe mig med at sprede dette meget vigtige budskab. Kontakt mig gerne ved spørgsmål eller for uddybende info.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I started an Instagram account for Elvis four years ago in an effort to share my special moments with him to add some positivity into the world. Since then, I've been able to build a community who genuinely enjoy the content Elvis and I create and put out into the world. I've been able to connect with people all over the world and brighten their day through sharing original photos and videos of Elvis. We regularly use our platform to bring awareness to causes close to our hearts such as mental health awareness, animal welfare &amp; responsible pet-ownership. As someone who faces daily battles with anxiety &amp; depression, the past year was particularly fraught with challenges such as a heartbreak, career changes &amp; supporting parents throughout their battle with cancer. I feel very lucky to have Elvis by my side through these trying times and he has taught me so much about being present, resilient and grateful for the beauty of those fleeting ordinary moments. I created this book as an expression of gratitude, in an effort to give back to the universe for giving me the opportunity to learn and grow with this magnificent dog. This book is filled with daily reminders &amp; joyful messages and my intention is to spread this message of positivity as far as I can. I like to describe it as a children's book for adults because both the images &amp; messages resonate with both adults and children. I fundamentally believe that teaching young people about mindfulness &amp; presence can change their lives for the better and that's exactly what I would love your help to do. With your help I hope to print as many copies of this book as I can and donate it to schools, hospitals and absolutely anywhere that could use a little ray of sunshine. Best of all, your contributions will also support local businesses because this book will be printed in Canada. Ultimately I would love to print and distribute as many copies as I can so I can work with a publisher and reach even more people, and create more books &amp; content!  I truly believe that the messages contained within the pages of this book has the ability to change the way you look at life, and will at the very least bring a smile to your face. </p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Siaara Freeman (she/her) is a performance poet who has travelled around  the world sharing her poems centering in her identity as an Urban Black Queer Femme.  Her book, Good Morning Hood Warning, is inspired by a need to show there is joy where most least expect it. She is driven to make herself and her talents accessible, because she believes that is the key to grace. She wants queer writer's to feel seen without a heteronormative gaze.</p>
<p>Lou Barrett (they/them) runs a Cleveland based publishing company called Purpled Palm Press, which only publishes writing by LGBTQ+ people. They released their own series, Pen Dive, which centers around a lesbian living in the Midwest; It's everything you could wish for in a dramedy, but with queer people. Lou's mission is to help eliminate shame around being LGBTQ+ one book, poem, or heartfelt conversation at a time. They also do everything they can to put Cleveland ""on the map"" as a place for queer culture and entertainment.</p>
<p>With both of our passions combined, we have decided to create an annual queer writing retreat called Outsiders.</p>
<p>Outsiders is dedicated to providing accessible writing support to queer writers in the Midwest by hosting an annual inclusive writing retreat in Southern, Ohio.</p>
<p>Through building community and giving writing workshops, writers can leave the retreat feeling more equipped to finish projects and use their LGBTQ+ identities to positively influence their writing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We're Crowdfunding</h3>
<p>We are doing a lot of local fundraising throughout the summer. However, people have asked us where they can donate to our project and we wanted a place that was easy and accessible for people to donate to if they wanted to.</p>
<p>Outsiders will take 8 writers who are chosen through a submission process. We require a 25 dollar submission fee from writers, but after that we aren't requiring any payment or fees from writers who are chosen to participate in this retreat.</p>
<p>That means that writers coming to Outsiders will get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four days and three nights stay in a cabin in Southern, Ohio</li>
<li>Delicious meals from local businesses for their time with us</li>
<li>Workshops by published authors in a variety of writing disciplines (all LGBTQ+)</li>
<li>Their work published in an anthology created by Purpled Palm Press</li>
<li>Four blissful days being surrounded by fellow queer people while building community and sharing space with each other</li>
</ul>
<p>... all for 25 dollars.</p>
<p>We wanted to make sure that this retreat would be accessible to people in varying income brackets. It didn't feel fair or right to hold a writing retreat for queer people that required them to pay hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>This means we have to cover the costs of the cabin, the workshop hosts, the food, etc etc.</p>
<p>We have started connecting with people to get some of the food donated. We feel confident that we can make this happen with or without donations because of our submission fee.</p>
<p>However, we wanted to give you the chance to donate to this if it's something you believe in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>We don't want you to give us money to fund this without getting something in return. The Outsiders Queer Writing Retreat participants will submit a finished piece of their writing as a part of their participation in our retreat. Purpled Palm Press will publish an anthology of the writing produced at the retreat, which will be released in the beginning of 2020.</p>
<p>As long as you donate at least 25 dollars, you'll get a copy of the book signed by us: Siaara Freeman and Lou Barrett.</p>
<p>For 50 dollars your book will be signed by not only the two of us, but the 8 writers participating in Outsiders as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Something like this retreat take a lot more than money. We are happy to accept donations of items such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notebooks</li>
<li>Pens</li>
<li>Pencils</li>
<li>Snacks</li>

<h3>Greetings!</h3>
<p>My name is Monte Stone. I'm a published expert on the works of Richard Wagner. I am the producer and author of <i>The Ring Disc: An Interactive Guide to Wagner's Ring Cycle. </i>The New York Times called it ""...the most complete, accessible, and sophisticated guide to Wagner's Ring ever created...an amazing tool"".  Since its release 20 years ago I have watched with dismay as many books and articles have appeared claiming that Wagner ""influenced"" Hitler;  some insisting that Wagner bears responsibility for World War II and the Holocaust. This ""theory "" it total rubbish, and my book proves it with excruciatingly detailed documentation. Simply put,  Adolf Hitler never said or wrote a word about ""Wagnerian inspiration"", and the ""theory"" is  fiction contrived from a few Hitler ""quotations"" from thoroughly debunked sources. Among them:</p>
<p>Hitler never said ""Whoever wants to understand National Socialism must know Wagner"". </p>
<p>Hitler's ""new interpretation"" of Parsifal and ""Parsifal religion"" come from two ass-covering ""former"" Nazis, one of whom was hanged at Nuremberg in 1946. The two Nazis plagiarized  an obscure Nazi musicologist writing in 1931, placing his words on Hitler's lips.</p>
<p>The Nazi rallying cry ""Germany Awake!"" does not come from Die Meistersinger, but from Hitler's pal Dietrich Eckart. </p>
<p>It is vitally important to set the record straight on this issue, not only for admirers of Wagner's operas, but also for proponents of honest and empirical Third Reich history.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>My book is written. Buy an advance copy.</h3>
<p>My book is finished and edited, and a designer is working on it now. This campaign will cover the costs of editor and designer, and the printing costs of the first edition. The book will be issued as a high quality paperback.</p>
<p>The ""perks"" program is pretty straight forward. Your contribution buys an advance copy of the finished book, hot off the press. I am asking those who are able to purchase additional copies for distribution to reviewers, publicists, Wagner Societies, etc.</p>

<p><i>The beginning is the ending and the ending is the beginning.</i> These are the words silence offered to me as I contemplated how to open this story. Where do I start? How did it all begin?

<p>“I want you to go back now, to one of your earliest childhood memories.

<p>Hi, I'm Laurie, the naked girl in the sprinklers. You've just read the opening of my memoir, <i>The Suicide Slippers</i>, a weaving, winding, labyrinth of a tale.</p>
<p>There was a time when authoring a book didn’t exist in my realm of possibilities. Writing was a side note reserved for journals, for processing melodramas and difficult break-ups. If writing failed me, I’d call my go-to guy, Phil, who always talked me through the shittiest of times.</p>
<p>Phil. He and I had fallen in love and dated until life’s circumstances separated us, but our bond endured. It was his pushing that prompted me to begin the healing process for my childhood trauma, and in many ways, I viewed him as my savior. </p>
<p>In July of 2012, Phil took his own life. I couldn't save my savior. Suicide killed him. It killed everything I thought I was and everything I thought I knew. After he left, I looked down at my feet and wondered how or if they could step out of the dilapidated shelter I found myself in. They were not adorned with the ruby slippers I’d always dreamed about, but imprisoned in shoes I’d never asked for, nor conceived of. I was left with the choice to stand my ground and disintegrate, or to break them in.</p>
<p>All bearings lost, I walked, I wandered, I fell on my ass and I walked some more. Along the way I sought a companion—a guidebook that spoke my language, but no such book had been written, so I released my own words. Writing became something I had to do—to survive, to heal, to educate, to shatter stigma, to connect. I wanted to talk about what no one else wanted to. I wanted people to understand that Phil wasn't selfish or a coward. When I discovered unconventional, mindful, novel ways of enduring grief, I wanted to scream them from the rooftops and scatter the pages for the world to find. </p>
<p>When life threw more obstacles my way, I set writing aside. My healing evolution continued, and without conscious effort, the story entered a massive collecting era, culminating into a solo trip to Thailand in 2018. There, I was met with wonder and mishaps and parallels and metaphors galore. I wrote it all down in the journal I brought with me--a flimsy pink one with gold pineapples on it. Upon returning home, words continued to pour out and didn’t stop until there was a book.</p>
<p><i><strong>What's in the book?</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>A raw account of enduring childhood trauma, suicide grief and stigma</li>
<li>An invitation to join me in my steps and missteps, adventures and misadventures as I intertwine my childhood, my story with Phil and my trip to Thailand, to convene in one destination--home. </li>

Hi, I'm Laurie, the naked girl in the sprinklers. You've just read the opening of my memoir, The Suicide Slippers, a weaving, winding, labyrinth of a tale.
There was a time when authoring a book didn’t exist in my realm of possibilities. Writing was a side note reserved for journals, for processing melodramas and difficult break-ups. If writing failed me, I’d call my go-to guy, Phil, who always talked me through the shittiest of times.
Phil. He and I had fallen in love and dated until life’s circumstances separated us, but our bond endured. It was his pushing that prompted me to begin the healing process for my childhood trauma, and in many ways, I viewed him as my savior. 
In July of 2012, Phil took his own life. I couldn't save my savior. Suicide killed him. It killed everything I thought I was and everything I thought I knew. After he left, I looked down at my feet and wondered how or if they could step out of the dilapidated shelter I found myself in. They were not adorned with the ruby slippers I’d always dreamed about, but imprisoned in shoes I’d never asked for, nor conceived of. I was left with the choice to stand my ground and disintegrate, or to break them in.
All bearings lost, I walked, I wandered, I fell on my ass and I walked some more. Along the way I sought a companion—a guidebook that spoke my language, but no such book had been written, so I released my own words. Writing became something I had to do—to survive, to heal, to educate, to shatter stigma, to connect. I wanted to talk about what no one else wanted to. I wanted people to understand that Phil wasn't selfish or a coward. When I discovered unconventional, mindful, novel ways of enduring grief, I wanted to scream them from the rooftops and scatter the pages for the world to find. 
When life threw more obstacles my way, I set writing aside. My healing evolution continued, and without conscious effort, the story entered a massive collecting era, culminating into a solo trip to Thailand in 2018. There, I was met with wonder and mishaps and parallels and metaphors galore. I wrote it all down in the journal I brought with me--a flimsy pink one with gold pineapples on it. Upon returning home, words continued to pour out and didn’t stop until there was a book.
What's in the book?

A raw account of enduring childhood trauma, suicide grief and stigma
An invitation to join me in my steps and missteps, adventures and misadventures as I intertwine my childhood, my story with Phil and my trip to Thailand, to convene in one destination--home. 
F-bombs. Suicide, when it came to me, wasn't coated in sugar, that's why.
Humor. Because when the heavy parts aren't coated in sugar, doses of humor make them more digestible.
The impact of stigma--a call to raise awareness. 
Complications of traumatic grief
 A collection of unconventional, new-agey, mindfulness-heavy tools to navigate grief and trauma
Spiritual evolution, resilience, transcendence, hope

 
If I had to sum up the feedback from my beta readers, it would be this: “You’re a dumbass if you don’t pursue this.” This book will be life-changing for people, they say. They say it and the oldest, wisest part of me knows it too. And so, onward I go. This is where you come in…
 
Funding--What for?

It's not easy being an un-famous, first-time, non-fiction author. I've got an important message, but what I don't have, as a semi-normal person, is a plethora of social media followers. Big publishers ain't got time for that.
But...smaller publishing houses might, or there's self-publishing (see my FAQ's as to why this is not a cop out).
Before I send this manuscript/book proposal out to potential publishers and agents, I want it to be as polished as possible, which means professional editing is a must. I've sent a sample to an agency here in Austin. One of their editors, a New York Times bestselling author wants to take it on and I'd like to take her up on that. 
Developmental and copy editing will cost at least $5,000.
If I don't reach my fundraising goal, it's all good. Any little bit will help. Every step forward is a step closer.

 
The Impact

A person who has lost someone to suicide is almost 10 times more likely to die from suicide themselves in the aftermath. When it happened to me, I felt isolated and directionless. I wanted to die. This is the book I needed but couldn't find. I know it will be a valuable find for others--a connection, a companion, maybe even life-saving.
This book isn't only for suicide loss survivors. It can benefit anyone who has ever dealt with trauma, grief or an innate feeling of defectiveness or disconnectedness.
It will be a useful guide for knowing how to approach or deal with someone in your life who may be going through traumatic grief or a life upheaval. 
Along with my raw, unapologetic story, I share specific tools and mindfulness strategies to bolster healing and hope for others.
My book raises mental health and suicide stigma awareness.

<p>Many confuse intimacy with sex, but it is so much more. It is the stuff that forms a solid foundation for relationships. If we consider a house as love, and intimacy as the foundation supporting that love, then we understand that if ingredients in that foundation are missing, it can crack. If the foundation fails, so does the love.</p>
<p>Intimacy is an intoxicating cocktail of trust, respect, care, affection, nursing, honesty, sex , romance and more. It lasts longer than the 7 minutes of physical pleasure. It can endure a lifetime, if we know what’s involved.</p>
<p>The ABC’s of Intimacy explores all the ingredients and helps you understand their importance and value. We all seek to belong in a loving relationship with our lovers, spouses, family members and friends, but we must first begin with ourselves. Self love allows us to understand how love feels and when we know love for ourselves. We can embrace the idea of “Love thy neighbor as you love yourself” and know what we need and want in a loving relationship.</p>
<p>Whether you chose to purchase the book, listen to the audio program or attend a live event, the ABC’s of Intimacy is a gentle reminder of what may be missing or overlooked in your relationship.</p>
<p>Why search or wonder what is missing any longer? Reignite the passion, fun, and happiness you once shared. It’s as easy as ABC. </p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, politicians and business leaders do not lead, but rather follow the will of the people.  The extent to which our institutions remain purposeless, or working against the well-being of humanity, creating oppression, ecological destruction and an increasingly toxic planet, is driven, in large part, to humanity's disconnection from purpose.</p>
<p>A 2014 Gallup study revealed that 87% of humanity is not engaged at work, disconnected from their life's purpose to the tune of at least 40 hours a week.  87% of humanity is either doing the wrong job, or working in a powerful transformational capacity without giving their all.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that humanity has collectively driven itself to the brink of destruction, as recent reports from NASA, the UN/IPCC, as well as many for-profit interests (Grantham, PIMCO, Swiss Re and Shell Oil), have concluded that complex human society and industrialized capitalism will collapse in as little as 15 years, resulting in casualties of up to 80%.  That's 4 out of every 5 people you love.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, historical levers of change are no longer of use, as major democracies have become oligarchies, wherein the democratic process only represents those who can pay for influence via lobbyists.  As a 2015 Princeton study revealed, the United States is effectively an oligarchy.  We can't wait for politicians and legislators to save us this time; we need a new way to create the life and world we want.</p>

<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>The task rests solely upon us as individual Earth citizens, to awaken ourselves, to recreate our entire lives with our life's purpose at the center, to overcome all the obstacles to living our purpose, to realize all the amazing benefits of living a life of purpose (a long life of vitality, abundance and love) and create communities and an economic system that will enable the continuance and flourishing of the human species.</p>
<p>The only thing in our way is cultural transformation - developing a deep connection to our life's purpose and cultivating the powerful skills required to live it and change the human condition - creating a just, sustainable and peaceful human presence on Planet Earth.</p>

<div>“I would recommend doing the 21-Day Purpose Challenge to anyone. It is the <b>most important course I have ever done. </b>Not only have I found a new lust for life, I also learned some basic truths about myself. I now know that, if in doubt, I have to consult my various personas to remove any hesitancy. This course taught me newfound respect for myself and also the people that I encounter, and will meet in the future.” Paul Z.<br/><br/>
</div>“I recommend this program to any person who wants to find their purpose in life. This is the <b>best thing that has ever happened to me</b>.  Until today I was not really sure of what I wanted, but now I know so much about myself I can't ever get lost again. The support I got from the Facebook group was very useful, it made me feel comfortable and that I was not alone in this journey. I thank Brandon and the team for everything they did!” Izabella S.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>“This 21-Day Purpose Challenge program is very thorough, with many explanations, tools and presentations and is <b>the best way to achieve a specific life purpose for the individual that I have come across in my 92 years of life</b>. I had participated previously with two teachers on the subject of life purpose and so I can evaluate what a wonderful instructive program is presented here.” Marlyse K.</div>
<div>
<br/>“I have spent 64 years trying to ‘figure it out’ and Brandon helped me <b>cut to the chase in 21 days!</b>” Cheri A.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>“My emotions varied from delight and joy to sadness, tears, frustration and even anger, but at the end of the purpose challenge, I have found a <b>deeper understanding of myself and how I want to relate with the world</b>.” Trevor N.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<br/>“I can't comment enough on Brandon's daily words of wisdom - almost every time, he would touch some parts of my consciousness, its nerve -seamlessly guessing, correctly, the very things that are bearing on my mind... <b>what this world is really missing is its purpose, being declared loudly, followed relentlessly</b>... before it's too late.” Vladimir V.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Nothing worth doing comes easy, and the Purpose Revolution is no different.  Collectively, we've invested at least 2,000 hours into researching and writing ""The Purpose Revolution"" book and crafting the Science of Purpose video series.  Both are on track to be in your hands in early 2016.  However, the last 5% is what is the most difficult, and what makes a good book and video great.  Although we are on track for early 2016 release dates, we recognize that this is a complex process with many moving parts and it may indeed take longer than that.</p>
<p>Quality is job one, as we believe the future of our species relies on both the book and video series being great.  If we determine we need to extend the deadline a few weeks or months, to add necessary incremental value to the project, we will do that.</p>
<p>I'm confident we'll overcome any challenges we encounter together, as we are a team of seasoned experts, activists and writers, who have published books in the past and love working together.  What I can absolutely guarantee you is that we'll be in communication with you all the way, and let you know how the project is developing.</p>

The Purpose Revolution Timeline








The 21-Day Purpose Challenge
Transformation and Activation Process
In August of 2015, this global family of participants completed one purpose discovery exercise a day for 21 days.  They shared their experience and supported each other in the Purpose Challengers Facebook group, gained greater clarity on their purpose, removed internal obstacles to them taking action on their purpose and created a way to live their purpose in the world, by building a team to execute their purpose projects in their local communities.






Of those who completed the post-Challenge feedback survey, 95% were more deeply connected to their purpose and said that they would recommend the Challenge to family members and friends.  (Read the testimonials below.)  Your support is needed to help us awaken our entire species to their life's purpose.





Going Global

We're excited to report that in 2016, The Purpose Revolution book will be translated into Spanish by Izabella Sepulveda, and the 21-Day Purpose Challenge will be delivered in Spanish by Oscar Medina.



Who We Are
January's Challenge will be delivered by a global team of Certified Challenge Leaders hailing from Romania, Aruba, Holland, the United States, Mexico and Canada!



The People Behind the Revolution

Why We Need a Purpose Revolution
Contrary to popular belief, politicians and business leaders do not lead, but rather follow the will of the people.  The extent to which our institutions remain purposeless, or working against the well-being of humanity, creating oppression, ecological destruction and an increasingly toxic planet, is driven, in large part, to humanity's disconnection from purpose.
A 2014 Gallup study revealed that 87% of humanity is not engaged at work, disconnected from their life's purpose to the tune of at least 40 hours a week.  87% of humanity is either doing the wrong job, or working in a powerful transformational capacity without giving their all.
It is no wonder that humanity has collectively driven itself to the brink of destruction, as recent reports from NASA, the UN/IPCC, as well as many for-profit interests (Grantham, PIMCO, Swiss Re and Shell Oil), have concluded that complex human society and industrialized capitalism will collapse in as little as 15 years, resulting in casualties of up to 80%.  That's 4 out of every 5 people you love.

Unfortunately, historical levers of change are no longer of use, as major democracies have become oligarchies, wherein the democratic process only represents those who can pay for influence via lobbyists.  As a 2015 Princeton study revealed, the United States is effectively an oligarchy.  We can't wait for politicians and legislators to save us this time; we need a new way to create the life and world we want.

How You Can Help
The task rests solely upon us as individual Earth citizens, to awaken ourselves, to recreate our entire lives with our life's purpose at the center, to overcome all the obstacles to living our purpose, to realize all the amazing benefits of living a life of purpose (a long life of vitality, abundance and love) and create communities and an economic system that will enable the continuance and flourishing of the human species.
The only thing in our way is cultural transformation - developing a deep connection to our life's purpose and cultivating the powerful skills required to live it and change the human condition - creating a just, sustainable and peaceful human presence on Planet Earth.

poetry collections that have fallen out of print and publishing poetry in translation from around the world. Since 2009, we have published work by overlooked masters like Eunice Odio and Adrian C. Louis alongside Nobel Laureates like Tomas
Transtr<i><em>ö</em></i>mer and Nelly Sachs. We keep every title in our catalog, known as The Living Library, in print in perpetuity.</p><br/><b>About This Project</b><br/><p>Next spring, Tavern Books will publish Anna Świrszczyńska's <i>Building the
Barricade</i> in a bilingual edition, translated from the Polish by
Piotr Florczyk. This cycle of 101 poems, which delivers poignant, indelible
lyric dispatches from within the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, was first published
in Poland in 1974 and has never before been available in its entirety
to a North American audience.<br/></p>
<p><i>Building the Barricade</i> offers a firsthand,
documentary account — in verse — of the World War II operation staged by the Polish resistance Home Army to liberate Warsaw from Nazi Germany. It contains the unique perspective of an individual who was both a participant in the resistance movement and a respected poet by trade. Thirty years after the 63-day uprising, Świrszczyńska,
who worked as a nurse within the barricade, felt compelled to write a testimony that functions
simultaneously as memoir, journalistic report, and high art. In a
style marked by objectivity, empathy, immediacy, and
introspection, Świrszczyńska evokes memories of the suffering and
atrocities that unfolded across the city.<br/></p><p>This is a book that Tavern Books has long dreamed of publishing and making available to a wide reading public in an English translation. This year, we acquired permission from the Świrszczyńska estate to pursue this project and enlisted Piotr Florczyk to translate the book in its entirety. This edition will feature an introduction by award-winning poet Eavan Boland. Like all our titles, <i>Building the Barricade</i> will be released in hardcover and paperback editions.<br/></p><p><i><b>We need your help to bring these essential poems of witness to an English-speaking audience in an exquisite translation. Join us in giving Świrszczyńska's voice a permanent home.<br/></b></i></p>

poetry collections that have fallen out of print and publishing poetry in translation from around the world. Since 2009, we have published work by overlooked masters like Eunice Odio and Adrian C. Louis alongside Nobel Laureates like Tomas
Tranströmer and Nelly Sachs. We keep every title in our catalog, known as The Living Library, in print in perpetuity.About This ProjectNext spring, Tavern Books will publish Anna Świrszczyńska's Building the
Barricade in a bilingual edition, translated from the Polish by
Piotr Florczyk. This cycle of 101 poems, which delivers poignant, indelible
lyric dispatches from within the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, was first published
in Poland in 1974 and has never before been available in its entirety
to a North American audience.
Building the Barricade offers a firsthand,
documentary account — in verse — of the World War II operation staged by the Polish resistance Home Army to liberate Warsaw from Nazi Germany. It contains the unique perspective of an individual who was both a participant in the resistance movement and a respected poet by trade. Thirty years after the 63-day uprising, Świrszczyńska,
who worked as a nurse within the barricade, felt compelled to write a testimony that functions
simultaneously as memoir, journalistic report, and high art. In a
style marked by objectivity, empathy, immediacy, and
introspection, Świrszczyńska evokes memories of the suffering and
atrocities that unfolded across the city.This is a book that Tavern Books has long dreamed of publishing and making available to a wide reading public in an English translation. This year, we acquired permission from the Świrszczyńska estate to pursue this project and enlisted Piotr Florczyk to translate the book in its entirety. This edition will feature an introduction by award-winning poet Eavan Boland. Like all our titles, Building the Barricade will be released in hardcover and paperback editions.We need your help to bring these essential poems of witness to an English-speaking audience in an exquisite translation. Join us in giving Świrszczyńska's voice a permanent home.
How You Can HelpYour contribution of any size will help us produce this vital work of
art and history, as well as place it into the hands of readers and onto the shelves of
institutions, libraries, bookstores, and classrooms nationwide. Every dollar counts; whether you can give $30 or
$3,000, you will be investing in a literary
landmark.
In return for your generosity and vision, we are excited to offer an 
array of gifts to funders of this campaign. Check out our incentives at the right of the page.Our goal is to raise $10,000 in order to publish, promote, and distribute a beautiful book.About the BookBuilding the Barricade by Anna Świrszczyńska, translated from the Polish by Piotr Florczyk.

Tavern Books has been publishing since 2009, and during
that time we've worked with numerous estates, archives, copyright holders, and
universities to realize our editorial vision. To date, we've published 36 titles from 12 languages under the auspices of state funders, private foundations, and national granting agencies, including the Lannan
Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. We work closely with our living authors and translators at every step of production. Building the Barricade is a title that has been on the radar for a long time.We are reaching out to the public to engage our readers with
the production of this book and to allow us to have an even stronger
audience impact.What does your gift mean? On a practical level,
the funds raised through this campaign will offset printing costs,
translator fees, book design, editing, acquisition, and distribution. But at another level, the magnitude of your donation is unquantifiable; Building the Barricade is a tangible monument to
remembering and to empathy, a summons to recall the humanity that 
persists in the face of suffering. Your funds 
will go toward preserving
a moment in history that is, like all historical experiences, 
susceptible to being
forgotten.And, of course, your donation will fuel the overarching mission and philosophy of 
Tavern Books, which is to preserve printed books and book culture.

<h3>The
Story</h3>
<p><span><span>My
name is Sonia Hidalgo Z, I am an architect. I have realized the basic
plans for the future temple in Jerusalem, previously to this work, I
have deciphered every verse of the Prophet Ezekiel's book. Once the
basic project was finished, I dedicated myself to prepare digital 3D
versions of it. The software I work with is good enough, but I need a
more realistic render of the project.</span></span></p>

Mi nombre es Sonia Hidalgo Z, soy arquitecta.  He realizado los planos para el futuro templo o Beit Hamikdash en Jerusalén.<br/><br/>Para continuar con el trabajo de investigación, estudio y ejecución del proyecto del templo, necesito dinero para comprar programas mas sofisticados, una impresora 3d, además necesito traductores con mínimo 3 idiomas: inglés, hebreo y español para traducir el libro técnico sobre el templo que he escrito.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1305939/files/20150318125600-117.JPG?1426708560"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>W</b><b>hat
I need and what you obtain</b></p>
<p>To
continue with the investigative work, the study and execution of the
temple project, I need money to buy more sophisticated software, a 3D
printer, a presentational video and a more realistic render of the
project. I also need translations into 3 languages: English, Hebrew
and Spanish to compare the texts with the plans I made and to edit
and publish the book about the description of the temple with
technical commentary, images, plans and measurements. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Money
is needed for advertising and the spreading of the project.</p>
<p>It
is also expected to do a scale model of the entire project. To that
end, a team with people specialized in miniature architectural
modeling is needed and I would also like to form a non-profit
association or associate with an already existing institution to be
able to officially act as “constructors of the temple”</p>
<b>
</b><p><b><span>What
you gain:</span></b>
</p>
<p>1.-
There are many prices, you chose which one you like the most</p>
<p>2.-
With my work you can achieve a comprehension of the description of
the temple, which until now had been very difficult to understand.</p>
<p>3.-
All donors will be inscribed in the book as active participants of
this great project.</p>
<p>4.-
World wide reaching bonds of friendship uniting people in one common
cause</p>
<p><span>5.-
Taking part of a cultural work and the learning of the architectural
part of the temple</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1251750/files/20150226130104-109.JPG?1424984464"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p>

Lo que necesito y lo que obtienes</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Los
planos están casi terminados y necesito
hacer un buen vídeo y un render  mas realista del proyecto.  Necesito dinero
para publicidad, difundir
el proyecto, publicar el libro con comentarios, medidas y planos del
templo de Ezequiel.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Está
además previsto hacer una maqueta de todo el proyecto, para ello se
necesita formar un buen equipo con personas especializadas en modelos
de arquitectura además me gustaría formar una asociación sin ánimos
de lucro o asociarme con alguna institución ya existente para poder
actuar oficialmente como “Constructores del Templo”.</p>
<p>Las personas obtienen: <br/></p>
<p>1.- El conocimiento de la descripción del templo.</p>
<p>2.- La descripción del templo que hasta hoy había sido difícil de entender y que gracias a las nuevas tecnologías será accesible al entendimiento de todo el mundo.</p>
<p>3.- El orgullo de haber participado en un proyecto milenial.</p>
<p>4.- Generar lazos de amistad a nivel mundial uniéndonos en una causa.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1251754/files/20150226130130-108.JPG?1424984490"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>
</p>
<h3>The
impact and the why of this campaign</h3>
<p><span>1.-
More than 2000 years have passed since the prophecy of the future
temple in Jerusalem was written. A prophecy very difficult to
understand up until now, there are very few works that strictly
follow the description of the temple according to the prophet
Ezekiel.</span>
</p>
<p>2.-
Institutions and associations should unite to attain the achievement
of the study of the temple, first at an educational level and later
on a fisical level with the construction of the temple.</p>
<p>3.-
My project is almost finished and if all the people that made similar
studies would unite, we would soon come to a conclusion. I think we
should invite all scholars in the topic to participate in the
project, it is not about competition, but about uniting goals and
efforts.</p>
<p>4.-
I have at my disposition graphic material: pictures, 3D renders and
presentations to instruct young architects that would be interested
in the topic, furthermore I thought of joining an association or
institution to cooperate and interact together.</p>
<p><span>5.-
The plans I created follow strictly the description of the temple
acording to Ezekiel, verse after verse and they also obey all the
necessary aspects for the correct operation of the temple: doors,
land levels, vertical and horizontal communications (staircases and
elevators), bathrooms, dining rooms, storage rooms, reception desks,
water fountains, etc...</span>
</p>
<p><span>6.-
My idea is that the more we are occupied in the study and the
learning of the temple, the faster we will achieve the conclusion of
the project. For now only on an educational and informative level.</span>
</p>
<b>El impacto y el por que de esta campana</b><br/>
</div><div> <p>
</p>
<p>1.-
Han pasado mas de dos mil anos que se escribió la profecía del templo futuro en Jerusalén, profecía muy difícil de entender hasta la fecha, hay muy pocos trabajos que se rigen estrictamente a la descripción del templo según el profeta Ezequiel.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>2.- Según mis cálculos un equipo de 5 arquitectos, podría tardar
unos 12 años en conseguir descifrar a Ezequiel y en confeccionar los
planos, sin embargo, mi proyecto esta casi completo y es de gran interés para todos los que creen en la profecía y en la llegada del Mesías.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>3.-
Cuento con material gráfico: imágenes, 3 d y presentaciones, para instruir a jóvenes arquitectos que estén interesados en el tema, además he pensado que podría unirme con alguna asociación o instituto para colaborar e interactuar conjuntamente, pero por lo pronto me encuentro sola en este barco.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>4.-
Mis planos se rigen estrictamente a la descripción del templo según Ezequiel, verso a verso y además cumplen con todos los aspectos necesarios para el buen
funcionamiento del templo: puertas, niveles
de terreno, comunicación vertical y horizontal (escaleras,
ascensores), baños, comedores, lugar para guardar cosas,
recepciones, fuentes de agua, etc... 


<br/></p>

5.- Mi idea es que mientras mas personas estemos ocupadas en estudiar y aprender sobre el templo, mas rápido conseguiremos realizar el proyecto.  Por ahora solo a nivel educativo e informativo.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1251757/files/20150226130235-92.JPG?1424984555"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/><b><h3>
</h3>
<h3><b>Risks
and challenges</b></h3>
</b><p>I
think: no risk, no challenge.</p>
<p>The
first risk would be not doing anything and remain inert, the
challenge is to continue with this project no matter what, until the
goal is reached.</p>
<p><span>The
second risk would be not achieving the stipulated goal, however the
author of this project will continue with the work regardless and
commits to deliver the prices to the people that request them.</span>

que es un proyecto de interés mundial.  Soy

Story
My
name is Sonia Hidalgo Z, I am an architect. I have realized the basic
plans for the future temple in Jerusalem, previously to this work, I
have deciphered every verse of the Prophet Ezekiel's book. Once the
basic project was finished, I dedicated myself to prepare digital 3D
versions of it. The software I work with is good enough, but I need a
more realistic render of the project.

Mi nombre es Sonia Hidalgo Z, soy arquitecta.  He realizado los planos para el futuro templo o Beit Hamikdash en Jerusalén.Para continuar con el trabajo de investigación, estudio y ejecución del proyecto del templo, necesito dinero para comprar programas mas sofisticados, una impresora 3d, además necesito traductores con mínimo 3 idiomas: inglés, hebreo y español para traducir el libro técnico sobre el templo que he escrito.

What
I need and what you obtain
To
continue with the investigative work, the study and execution of the
temple project, I need money to buy more sophisticated software, a 3D
printer, a presentational video and a more realistic render of the
project. I also need translations into 3 languages: English, Hebrew
and Spanish to compare the texts with the plans I made and to edit
and publish the book about the description of the temple with
technical commentary, images, plans and measurements. 


Money
is needed for advertising and the spreading of the project.
It
is also expected to do a scale model of the entire project. To that
end, a team with people specialized in miniature architectural
modeling is needed and I would also like to form a non-profit
association or associate with an already existing institution to be
able to officially act as “constructors of the temple”

What
you gain:

1.-
There are many prices, you chose which one you like the most
2.-
With my work you can achieve a comprehension of the description of
the temple, which until now had been very difficult to understand.
3.-
All donors will be inscribed in the book as active participants of
this great project.
4.-
World wide reaching bonds of friendship uniting people in one common
cause
5.-
Taking part of a cultural work and the learning of the architectural
part of the temple





Lo que necesito y lo que obtienes 
Los
planos están casi terminados y necesito
hacer un buen vídeo y un render  mas realista del proyecto.  Necesito dinero
para publicidad, difundir
el proyecto, publicar el libro con comentarios, medidas y planos del
templo de Ezequiel.


Está
además previsto hacer una maqueta de todo el proyecto, para ello se
necesita formar un buen equipo con personas especializadas en modelos
de arquitectura además me gustaría formar una asociación sin ánimos
de lucro o asociarme con alguna institución ya existente para poder
actuar oficialmente como “Constructores del Templo”.
Las personas obtienen: 
1.- El conocimiento de la descripción del templo.
2.- La descripción del templo que hasta hoy había sido difícil de entender y que gracias a las nuevas tecnologías será accesible al entendimiento de todo el mundo.
3.- El orgullo de haber participado en un proyecto milenial.
4.- Generar lazos de amistad a nivel mundial uniéndonos en una causa.




The
impact and the why of this campaign
1.-
More than 2000 years have passed since the prophecy of the future
temple in Jerusalem was written. A prophecy very difficult to
understand up until now, there are very few works that strictly
follow the description of the temple according to the prophet
Ezekiel.

2.-
Institutions and associations should unite to attain the achievement
of the study of the temple, first at an educational level and later
on a fisical level with the construction of the temple.
3.-
My project is almost finished and if all the people that made similar
studies would unite, we would soon come to a conclusion. I think we
should invite all scholars in the topic to participate in the
project, it is not about competition, but about uniting goals and
efforts.
4.-
I have at my disposition graphic material: pictures, 3D renders and
presentations to instruct young architects that would be interested
in the topic, furthermore I thought of joining an association or
institution to cooperate and interact together.
5.-
The plans I created follow strictly the description of the temple
acording to Ezekiel, verse after verse and they also obey all the
necessary aspects for the correct operation of the temple: doors,
land levels, vertical and horizontal communications (staircases and
elevators), bathrooms, dining rooms, storage rooms, reception desks,
water fountains, etc...

6.-
My idea is that the more we are occupied in the study and the
learning of the temple, the faster we will achieve the conclusion of
the project. For now only on an educational and informative level.

El impacto y el por que de esta campana
 

1.-
Han pasado mas de dos mil anos que se escribió la profecía del templo futuro en Jerusalén, profecía muy difícil de entender hasta la fecha, hay muy pocos trabajos que se rigen estrictamente a la descripción del templo según el profeta Ezequiel.


2.- Según mis cálculos un equipo de 5 arquitectos, podría tardar
unos 12 años en conseguir descifrar a Ezequiel y en confeccionar los
planos, sin embargo, mi proyecto esta casi completo y es de gran interés para todos los que creen en la profecía y en la llegada del Mesías.


3.-
Cuento con material gráfico: imágenes, 3 d y presentaciones, para instruir a jóvenes arquitectos que estén interesados en el tema, además he pensado que podría unirme con alguna asociación o instituto para colaborar e interactuar conjuntamente, pero por lo pronto me encuentro sola en este barco.


4.-
Mis planos se rigen estrictamente a la descripción del templo según Ezequiel, verso a verso y además cumplen con todos los aspectos necesarios para el buen
funcionamiento del templo: puertas, niveles
de terreno, comunicación vertical y horizontal (escaleras,
ascensores), baños, comedores, lugar para guardar cosas,
recepciones, fuentes de agua, etc... 




5.- Mi idea es que mientras mas personas estemos ocupadas en estudiar y aprender sobre el templo, mas rápido conseguiremos realizar el proyecto.  Por ahora solo a nivel educativo e informativo.


Risks
and challenges
I
think: no risk, no challenge.
The
first risk would be not doing anything and remain inert, the
challenge is to continue with this project no matter what, until the
goal is reached.
The
second risk would be not achieving the stipulated goal, however the
author of this project will continue with the work regardless and
commits to deliver the prices to the people that request them.


Riesgos y desafíos
  
Estoy consciente de que hay mucha polémica en este asunto, sin embargo creo
que es un proyecto de interés mundial.  Soy
una persona neutral, no tengo nada en contra de ninguna religión y pienso que se podría convivir en armonía sin hacer la guerra
entre creencias y religiones buscando compromisos de amistad y
solidaridad. Si alguien me pregunta por que justamente mi persona ha realizado este proyecto, contestaré: por qué no? He trabajado contra viento y marea durante dos anos, quizá el tiempo mas difícil de mi vida ya que me ha tocado pasar por grandes sufrimientos, pero eso ya no es importante.

willen reageren tegen de achteloosheid van de autoriteiten die het 
misbruik laten voortduren.</p>
<p><strong>De eerste fase van het project is reeds uitgevoerd</strong> : 
we hebben een peiling onder de Belgische bevolking gehouden waarin we 
vroegen naar de minimumdienst in geval van staking. Daarnaast hebben we 
een rondvraag bij 4 ministers van het openbaar vervoer gedaan om naar 
hun standpunten te polsen. De peiling is goedkoop omdat ze gebruik maakt
 van de gegevens in de kieswijzer, waarin 18.630 respondenten de nodige 
informatie hebben geleverd om het monster in balans te houden. <a href=""http://www.wecitizens.be/nl/category/onze-campagnes/gebrekkige-overheidsdiensten/minimumdienst-bij-het-openbaar-vervoer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Het artikel staat op onze website</a>. Het zal ook worden verspreid 
via de krant Metro (10 februari, oplage 225.000 exemplaren), onze nieuwsbrief (meer 
dan 30.000 ontvangers) en de pers in het algemeen.   </p>
<p><strong>De tweede fase omvat een peiling onder de politieke actoren</strong> :
 onderzoek naar de parlementaire initiatieven, ondervraging van alle 484
 parlementsleden, de partijen en de vakbonden, inspectie op 
stellingnamen in de pers. Het resultaat van dat onderzoek zal in de

<br/>
<p><strong>De derde fase is een onderzoek naar de vraag van de stakingsposten</strong>:
 analyse van de rechtspraak, ondervraging van de bevoegde ministers. 
Vervolgens zal er een artikel worden verspreid op een manier die 
vergelijkbaar is met de 1ste fase.

<p>
<strong>De vierde fase bestaat uit een symposium</strong>, dat, indien mogelijk, zal worden gehouden in samenwerking met een reeds in België actieve denktank of met een universiteit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>De vijfde stap is de publicatie van een volmacht in de pers</strong>.
 Het doel is om de handtekeningen van minstens 40 persoonlijkheden uit 
vooral de universitaire kringen bijeen te krijgen. De tekst zou de 
wetgever moeten aanmoedigen om de stakingsrechten en –plichten te 
verduidelijken.  </p>

<p>a) Onderzoek van de parlementaire initiatieven: opzoeking in de 
archieven van federale en regionale parlementen; als een wet gestemd 
werd, kopiëren we het stemgedrag van de parlementsleden; als

Ik vrees dat sommige (politieke, sociale, industriële) autoriteiten hun persoonlijke belangen begunstigen ten nadele van het collectieve belang. Het feit dat politici recht hebben op een formele legitimiteit, waarborgt niet dat zij onze gemeenschappelijke belangen op bevredigende wijze 
behartigen.
</p>
<p>
Om de burgercontrole over de uitoefening van de macht op te schroeven, 
heb ik andere verdedigers van de democratie opgetrommeld. Wij hebben de 
vereniging <b>WeCitizens</b> (WijBurgers) opgestart, die niet mag worden 
verward met de Franse Partij Nous Citoyens ! 
</p>
<p>
WeCitizens, vereniging zonder winstoogmerk (vzw), drager van het huidige
 project, is een “Test-Aankoop” van de kiezer, een “Wikipedia” van 
politici, een educatief centrum voor de burger, een observatorium voor 
het openbaar bestuur. 
</p>
<p>
Als burgerlijk ingenieur was ik niet voorbestemd om me met politiek 
bezig te houden, maar wel om oplossingen met een hoge toegevoegde waarde te bieden. Eerder was ik betrokken bij ontwikkelingssamenwerking en bij andere initiatieven van maatschappelijk belang (wat me weinig tijd 
overliet voor mijn hobby; mountainbiken…).  
</p>
<p>
Zeven jaar lang was ik directeur aan de CREG, de Belgische, federale 
instantie voor de regulering van de elektriciteitsmarkt. Dat heeft me 
vertrouwd gemaakt met de werking van het openbaar bestuur.
</p>
<p>
In mei 2014, ten tijde van de verkiezingen, heeft WijBurgers een eerste 
versie van haar toepassing <a href=""http://www.directory.wecitizens.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>directory.wecitizens</b></a> online gezet, 
waarin ongeveer 5000 Belgische politieke actoren opgenomen zijn. Van hen hebben 150 kandidaten voor de verkiezingen van mei 2014 samengewerkt 
door een politieke vragenlijst in te vullen (voor de kieswijzer). Onze 
projecten worden bekrachtigd door een wetenschappelijk comité bestaande 
uit hoogleraren en journalisten. Iedere politieke partij benoemt een 
referentiepersoon die instaat voor een goede communicatie tussen de 
partij en WijBurgers.

De eerste fase van het project is reeds uitgevoerd : 
we hebben een peiling onder de Belgische bevolking gehouden waarin we 
vroegen naar de minimumdienst in geval van staking. Daarnaast hebben we 
een rondvraag bij 4 ministers van het openbaar vervoer gedaan om naar 
hun standpunten te polsen. De peiling is goedkoop omdat ze gebruik maakt
 van de gegevens in de kieswijzer, waarin 18.630 respondenten de nodige 
informatie hebben geleverd om het monster in balans te houden. Het artikel staat op onze website. Het zal ook worden verspreid 
via de krant Metro (10 februari, oplage 225.000 exemplaren), onze nieuwsbrief (meer 
dan 30.000 ontvangers) en de pers in het algemeen.   
De tweede fase omvat een peiling onder de politieke actoren :
 onderzoek naar de parlementaire initiatieven, ondervraging van alle 484
 parlementsleden, de partijen en de vakbonden, inspectie op 
stellingnamen in de pers. Het resultaat van dat onderzoek zal in de 
Politieke Databank worden geïntegreerd zodat het gemakkelijk te 
raad


De derde fase is een onderzoek naar de vraag van de stakingsposten:
 analyse van de rechtspraak, ondervraging van de bevoegde ministers. 
Vervolgens zal er een artikel worden verspreid op een manier die 
vergelijkbaar is met de 1ste fase.


De vierde fase bestaat uit een symposium, dat, indien mogelijk, zal worden gehouden in samenwerking met een reeds in België actieve denktank of met een universiteit.


De vijfde stap is de publicatie van een volmacht in de pers.
 Het doel is om de handtekeningen van minstens 40 persoonlijkheden uit 
vooral de universitaire kringen bijeen te krijgen. De tekst zou de 
wetgever moeten aanmoedigen om de stakingsrechten en –plichten te 
verduidelijken.  

De zesde stap zou een onderzoek (i) met betrekking tot de opgelegde (of onderzochte) sancties inhouden tegen het misbruik 
inzake stakingen en (ii) met betrekking tot de reglementaire projecten 
voor een minimale dienstverlening.




WAAR DIENT DE INZAMELING VOOR?
De fondsen die we verzamelen zullen (ter hoogte van € 2.900) dienen 
voor de tweede fase van ons project (gedurende de maand maart):
a) Onderzoek van de parlementaire initiatieven: opzoeking in de 
archieven van federale en regionale parlementen; als een wet gestemd 
werd, kopiëren we het stemgedrag van de parlementsleden; als 
wetsvoorstellen zijn ingediend, dan noteren wie de initiatiefnemers 
zijn.
b) Ondervraging van alle 438 parlementsleden: via e-mail, met een herinnering.
c) Ondervraging van de partijen en vakbonden: via e-mail + telefoontje.
d) via Google zoeken we naar de relevante figuren die zich over dit onderwerp hebben uitgesproken.
e) De resultaten van dit onderzoek zullen worden geïntegreerd in de Politieke Databank, zodat het grote publiek daar gemakkelijk kennis van kan nemen.
f) Publicatie van een artikel met de analyseresultaten.
Als we meer dan € 2900 verzamelen, zullen we het overschot gebruiken voor de volgende fasen van het project:Stap 3 : april - artikel (2) over de stakingspikette - 1.500Stap 4 : juni - Seminarie over de stakingswetgeving - 5.000Stap 5 : sept. - open brief, getekend door 40 personaliteiten - 2.000Stap 6 : oktober - artikel (3), follow-up: minimum dienst in het openbaar vervoer, wilde stakingen - 1.500
WIE BEN IK?
Net als jij probeer ik een verantwoordelijke burger te zijn. Ik vrees dat sommige (politieke, sociale, industriële) autoriteiten hun persoonlijke belangen begunstigen ten nadele van het collectieve belang. Het feit dat politici recht hebben op een formele legitimiteit, waarborgt niet dat zij onze gemeenschappelijke belangen op bevredigende wijze 
behartigen.


Om de burgercontrole over de uitoefening van de macht op te schroeven, 
heb ik andere verdedigers van de democratie opgetrommeld. Wij hebben de 
vereniging WeCitizens (WijBurgers) opgestart, die niet mag worden 
verward met de Franse Partij Nous Citoyens ! 


WeCitizens, vereniging zonder winstoogmerk (vzw), drager van het huidige
 project, is een “Test-Aankoop” van de kiezer, een “Wikipedia” van 
politici, een educatief centrum voor de burger, een observatorium voor 
het openbaar bestuur. 


Als burgerlijk ingenieur was ik niet voorbestemd om me met politiek 
bezig te houden, maar wel om oplossingen met een hoge toegevoegde waarde te bieden. Eerder was ik betrokken bij ontwikkelingssamenwerking en bij andere initiatieven van maatschappelijk belang (wat me weinig tijd 
overliet voor mijn hobby; mountainbiken…).  


Zeven jaar lang was ik directeur aan de CREG, de Belgische, federale 
instantie voor de regulering van de elektriciteitsmarkt. Dat heeft me 
vertrouwd gemaakt met de werking van het openbaar bestuur.


In mei 2014, ten tijde van de verkiezingen, heeft WijBurgers een eerste 
versie van haar toepassing directory.wecitizens online gezet, 
waarin ongeveer 5000 Belgische politieke actoren opgenomen zijn. Van hen hebben 150 kandidaten voor de verkiezingen van mei 2014 samengewerkt 
door een politieke vragenlijst in te vullen (voor de kieswijzer). Onze 
projecten worden bekrachtigd door een wetenschappelijk comité bestaande 
uit hoogleraren en journalisten. Iedere politieke partij benoemt een 
referentiepersoon die instaat voor een goede communicatie tussen de 
partij en WijBurgers.",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

A Childs Rhyme , with a beautifully illustrated 32 page Picture book by Robert J Costa and Little Steps Publishing.</em></h3><p>Dear friends, My name is Robert  Costa and I live on the Northern New South Wales coast in Australia. I'm a keen surfer, gardener and an Electrician by trade.  I have also worked in the sales and advertising industry after a work injury, which left me with less mobility. This injury time however, gave me the chance to fulfil a dream to write books for young children and I'm loving it. My books leave my readers uplifted and happy, with a real feeling of hope and vision. I love the children's faces when the story is over. In the case of Little Sower Sam, the kids can't wait to get out and grow something to share, which means I have succeeded in teaching  kids to live a happy, healthy, kind, sustainable lifestyle.</p><p>My campaign is to raise the funds to publish my first book ""Little Sower Samuel"". He is a young boy with a passion for growing plants from seed. He saves all his good seed from fruits and vegies, puts them in pots and grows them in his backyard. He ends up with so many trees and plants that he decides he must start to share them. This in turn starts an amazing community transformation, as everyone grasps  hold of the sharing food idea and join with him as well. It starts a chain reaction that truly blesses an entire community. Written in Rhyme, kids love the beat and flow of the story, as do adults alike. Loved by teachers , librarians, kids and parents , I'm really pleased I've found a fun way to do a little bit of good.</p><p> I am unable to fund it myself, as injury and time off work have taken their toll on my finances.

A Childs Rhyme , with a beautifully illustrated 32 page Picture book by Robert J Costa and Little Steps Publishing.Dear friends, My name is Robert  Costa and I live on the Northern New South Wales coast in Australia. I'm a keen surfer, gardener and an Electrician by trade.  I have also worked in the sales and advertising industry after a work injury, which left me with less mobility. This injury time however, gave me the chance to fulfil a dream to write books for young children and I'm loving it. My books leave my readers uplifted and happy, with a real feeling of hope and vision. I love the children's faces when the story is over. In the case of Little Sower Sam, the kids can't wait to get out and grow something to share, which means I have succeeded in teaching  kids to live a happy, healthy, kind, sustainable lifestyle.My campaign is to raise the funds to publish my first book ""Little Sower Samuel"". He is a young boy with a passion for growing plants from seed. He saves all his good seed from fruits and vegies, puts them in pots and grows them in his backyard. He ends up with so many trees and plants that he decides he must start to share them. This in turn starts an amazing community transformation, as everyone grasps  hold of the sharing food idea and join with him as well. It starts a chain reaction that truly blesses an entire community. Written in Rhyme, kids love the beat and flow of the story, as do adults alike. Loved by teachers , librarians, kids and parents , I'm really pleased I've found a fun way to do a little bit of good. I am unable to fund it myself, as injury and time off work have taken their toll on my finances. My manuscript is all finished and approved by my publisher, ""Little Steps Publishing"" Australia, who called it heart warming.They believe it will sell very well. It also has a recommendation by Virginia Lowe, who has sat as a judge on the children's book council of Australia and my brilliant artist is also ready to go when I am.

I also wish to give back to the people who help me get to started with signed first edition books.  Finance Required to get started

I truly believe that this book is an important work and will have a valuable impact  on the community at large, as it teaches children the principles of sustainable living, kindness and sharing.  The story encourages a strong sense of community and what can be achieved when people work together for the good of their neighbourhood.
I have spent many years as a community worker, charity worker and Sunday School teacher, so I have a strong understanding of the positive impact achieved when children and elders get together for a good cause.
