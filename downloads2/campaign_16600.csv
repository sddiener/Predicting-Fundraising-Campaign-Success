<h3>Savannah Shakes</h3>
<p>Since 2015, Savannah Shakes has been committed to serving as a home to William Shakespeare in the Lowcountry. Our goal was always been to champion the accessibility,  relevance, and entertainment of the Bard's works. At our founding, we developed the idea to set our productions in consecutive decades, traveling through the latter half of the 20th Century. <br/><br/>First, the genesis of it all, was a 1940s THE TAMING OF THE SHREW. We wanted to explore the dynamic between soldiers returning home from WW2 clashing with the women who had taken their places in the factories. It was like Rosie the Riveter vs. Captain America! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566448998/pgegmbxfzn9huuerib5p.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Next came our Beatnik HAMLET, where the Prince of Denmark's legendary introspection and philosophy found a home within the tortured minds of the Beat Generation. Hamlet's struggle to avenge his father was especially grueling up against the picket-fence (seeming) perfection of the rest of his family. </p>

<p>Moving into the late 60s, things took a darker turn for HENRY V inspired by the Vietnam War. We sought to explore the murky morality of Henry V's conquest of France through the lens of one of the most controversial wars this country has ever known.</p>

<p>The 1970s were a great time for Disco! Drawing heavy inspiration from the recently passed on legend David Bowie, we set THE TEMPEST in a psychedelic dance club, complete with knee-high boots, lots of sequins, and a Blues Brother or two.

<p>The late 1970s and early 1980s meant a plunge into the bloody excess of Grindhouse Horror and there's no better show for it than TITUS ANDRONICUS. It was a revenge cycle for the ages, pitting the morally ambiguous small-town police headed by Titus against the savage Goths led by their fearless queen, Tamora. Our second site-specific show: we did this in an actual movie theater with a guerilla theatre style set.</p>

<p>Finishing off the 20th Century, KING LEAR took place in a mysterious and dangerous cult community as the world-ending Y2K approached.

<p>And finally, last summer, we landed in the present with MEASURE FOR MEASURE, using it to explore the harrowing amount of abuse of power in our world today.

But that's not the end of this cycle, oh no. </p>
<p>Having caught up with the current timeline, we are taking our next production, MACBETH, into the future and outer space! The Tragedy of Macbeth is the story of a noble warrior who turns to the dark side. Sound familiar?  It has long been a dream of founder Chris Soucy to follow the story of Macbeth to a galaxy far, far away. Shakespeare packed this play with mysteries, intrigues, betrayals, and magic. And now we sit at our TENTH production and we'd like to go all out!</p>
<p>Your contribution would go to making Macbeth the biggest and most complex theatrical experience Savannah Shakes has ever undertaken. Our goal has always been to produce Shakespeare that can be enjoyed by academics and casual viewers alike. We are wanting to pool all our resources to make this a once-in-a-lifetime production.  We have long lived by the simple mantra, ""We don't produce shows to make money, we make money to produce shows."" So it is in that spirit, that we ask you for your generous help in presenting this show with FREE ADMISSION. If we can cover the costumes, the tech, the venue, and the talent through your donations, we will not charge for our tickets. Shakespeare for everyone because Shakespeare is for everyone! Admission is often one of the largest obstacles for people to take part in the magic of theatre so we'd love to remove that obstacle altogether!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's on the table?</h3>
<p>Savannah Shakes modestly figures a $5000 budget to produce this show. With that budget, we will pay the rental of the venue,  pay technicians and our director, and purchase costumes and props. Lightsabers aren't cheap! We are naturally producing the show regardless of meeting this projected goal. We will use whatever you graciously share with us to ensure that this show is fantastic. But if we were to exceed this budget, we would set aside money to go to performers, artists, and key crew who dedicate themselves regularly with only the reward of creating great art for the community.  </p>
<p>And what do you get? I'm glad we asked. The tiers of perks that your donation can get you are perkaliscious. Not a real word, but Shakespeare made up words all the time. All higher tier perks also get you all the perks below it.</p>

Every penny goes towards helping make this show a reality and a success.What’s in it for me?Starting at only $5, you start getting some cool rewards, like having your name included in our “Thank You” video, being thanked LIVE at a curtain call of your choice, an autographed photo of the cast, and first dibs on sitting in the first few rows of one of the shows!Plus, you get a great show put on by a talented director and cast (and Jamie), and you get to help make dreams come true!

Born in 1937 during the Great Depression, Cradle sings a tale of the downtrodden, the 99%, who ultimately rise together. In Cradle we see artists selling out to the wealthy, healthcare influenced by big money, the press owned by big business, the church controlled by its donors and war encouraged for corporate greed. Sound familiar? We laugh at the lampooned stereotypes, all the while discovering what our hero Larry Foreman knows: together that “Cradle Will Rock!”Both productions will be directed by David Fuller, with choreography by Judith Jarosz. This award-winning team brings to Brooklyn the high quality of professional theater which you have seen in other Theater 2020 ventures, such as Candide,A Little Night Music,Sweeney Todd, and last year’s Assassins.  Theater 2020, Visions for a new Millennium is guided by award winning theater artists David Fuller and Judith Jarosz who have produced and directed well over a hundred shows, Regionally, Off Broadway, and in NYC’s Indie Theatre (Off Off Broadway). They have been recognized with multiple awards and nominations including The National GLAAD awards, OOBR Awards, NYtheatre.com People of the Year, and New York Innovative Theater Awards.We believe live performance is an important part of a healthy culture and we are committed to diversity, remaining dedicated to our multi-cultural Brooklyn audiences and artists alike.

(https://www.instagram.com/hfillustration/) We are also offering (our favourite) a post-show whisky with the cast, and the opportunity to have your name in the play itself... Yee-ha! 
Digital Future Recording a digital version of the story means that it can reach a wider audience, those who are unable to attend in person, and show potential venue partners around the world our work.  Even if we are unable to reach our goal of £5000, 10% of what we have will go to Respect UK, and the rest towards the most essential costs – whatever we need most to get this show in the road. * The Impact10% of what we raise with this campaign will go to our charity partner Respect, who are leading the development of safe, effective work with perpetrators, male victims and young people using domestic violence and abuse. Alongside our performances we will be running free workshops in theatre-making at local 6th form colleges and Uni drama societies to engage young people in the arts - something that is more vital than ever in our beloved, struggling industry. This project will offer our company the chance to reach new audiences, professional connections and also to secure future writing/performing opportunities. We want to excel in making theatre that can thrive in a pandemic and bring audiences entertaining, thought provoking and pertinent work, particularly in rural areas where this kind of entertainment and culture is currently lacking. Your kind and generous contributions will make it possible for our debut play to premiere this summer and help us to take our work to a more accomplished and ambitious level.  This project represents a pivotal moment in our careers as we are on the cusp of establishing ourselves as an emerging company with it, and we’re looking towards touring it more widely in the future, as well as bringing other projects we are developing to life. * Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand that during these strange times folks have got bigger priorities than a project like ours.If this is you, thanks for reading all the way down. We hope this made you excited about what we are doing! If it did, go tell your neighbour about us. Get out on the streets and yell about us to startled passers-by. Tell yer grandma. Tell yer horse. Share this campaign on the interweb hocus-pocus: Instagram, Twitter, the Book of Faces. If you’ve got a coin or two to spare – consider spendin’ it on us. Don’t make us resort to robbin’ innocent members of the public at gun-point for funding. We don’t want it to come to that. No one does. We can’t go to the Camden Fringe if we’re Outlaws.Whoever you are, thank you kindly for taking the time to read this missive. We’ll see you on the horizon, friend.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>LCP Dance Theatre was formed in 2006 in London, is lead by artistic director Joanna Puchala. LCP is a multimedia and multiethnic dance company, which emphasizes on human rights issues mainly human trafficking. The aim is to bring awareness of inequality and violation of human rights around the world through the performing arts. </p>
<p>With support of BBC Performing Arts fund 2011 for the best choreography awarded to Mimmo Miccolis, LCP created a unique human rights based dance performance ""Rights(?)'. In collaboration with African Dance Company Tavaziva Dance and Bernie Grant Arts Centre, LCP stood for rights of equal race, gender, social and economic status. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHOdkC48zTM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHOdkC48zTM</a></p>
<p>LCP has been invited to Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2013 and 2014 with very succesful dance production ""AM I"". The performance was a manifests against human trafficking to prevent it from happening. 27 millions of people worldwide are trafficked mainly for labor and sexual slavery and only 1% starts a new life in a safe environment. LCP returns to Edinburgh Fringe 2015 with a new multimedia dance performance ‘I AM' to stand up for human rights to be respected.  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zse0LGikbOw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/K66URIShWbI</a></p>
<p>LCP is an organization with opened networks to various artists and institutions, which through different forms of art and other recourses manifest against violated rights. LCP partnerships with Sophie Hayes Foundation, which supports victims of human trafficking. Collaborates also with Minded Institute - leader in neuroscience, psychotherapy and body - mind approach to an alternative therapy of mental health. Integrates its principles in a perception of survivors mind and what triggers it. Links it in the community settings of victims of human trafficking by providing them with a movement therapy and choreography. Our aim is to offer the victims an opportunity to be involved in dance theatre, which we are creating. In association with higher education in London (LeSoCo College), LCP runs the educational scheme to support dance students in their professional training by facilitating them with additional dance company classes/workshops and merging their skills with the company’s repertoire. </p>
<p>The majority of LCP’s collaborators are volunteering. In response to our aim of bringing awareness of global human trafficking issue we are currently creating a new dance production “I AM” with a premier in Edinburgh Fringe festival 2015. The performance will take place at the Spotlites @ The Merchants' Hall in Edinburgh for 9 days from 23rd to 31st August 2015. 8 dancers of different multicultural background will perform. </p>
<p>The outcome of this online fund-raising campaign is to cover some of the expenses of participating in Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2015 such as travel expenses, the cost of publicity and venue’s hire. The estimated cost of 8 people: dancers/technician, traveling to Edinburgh and returning back, publicity and the venue’s hire is 7500$. We are putting on a pledge just part of it 2500$ wishing that the rest of it will be funded by the other third parties sources. We would appreciate if you could support us by any donation of 10, 20, 30£/$/€.

<p>We are very grateful to all volunteers who have been supporting our activities by providing us with their unique artistic, intellectual and administrative skills. Without them and LeSoCo College, this and other projects wouldn’t be possible to happen.</p>
<p>We have a very limited time before the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2015, however we believe that with your donation we will be able to proceed with our campaign of ‘dance stops trafficking’ through performing arts.

</h3><h3><br/></h3><h3>En résumé:</h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>KFM Crew est un groupe de danse créé en 2002 à Aigle, une petite ville de Suisse romande. Formés de personnes de tous âges de sept à trente ans, cela va faire treize ans que nous pratiquons le Break Dance et le Hip Hop. Plusieurs fois champions suisses, nous sommes également bien classés au niveau européen et avons déjà remporté plus d'une cinquantaine de titres depuis nos débuts. Lorsque que nous avons débuté en 2002 nous étions seulement cinq membres pour arriver aujourd'hui, après des années de persévérance et d'acharnement, à une soixantaine de personnes. </p><p>Nous nous entraînons de quinze à vingt heures par semaine et avons aujourd'hui besoin de votre soutien pour évoluer et avoir notre propre école de danse. Notre crew est une famille, nous sommes fiers de le représenter depuis si longtemps, d'avoir grandi ensemble et de nous être battus pour en arriver là où nous en sommes actuellement. </p><p>A l'époque, nous faisions nos répétitions dans le centre de jeune de Aigle, lieu qui n'est désormais plus adapté car il a déménagé dans un local trop petit. Nous sommes actuellement locataires dans une maison paroissiale, qui va malheureusement être détruite fin juin 2015 et nous faire nous retrouver à nouveau sans salle d'entrainement fixe, chose que nous ne pouvons plus nous permettre.

En résumé:
KFM Crew est un groupe de danse créé en 2002 à Aigle, une petite ville de Suisse romande. Formés de personnes de tous âges de sept à trente ans, cela va faire treize ans que nous pratiquons le Break Dance et le Hip Hop. Plusieurs fois champions suisses, nous sommes également bien classés au niveau européen et avons déjà remporté plus d'une cinquantaine de titres depuis nos débuts. Lorsque que nous avons débuté en 2002 nous étions seulement cinq membres pour arriver aujourd'hui, après des années de persévérance et d'acharnement, à une soixantaine de personnes. Nous nous entraînons de quinze à vingt heures par semaine et avons aujourd'hui besoin de votre soutien pour évoluer et avoir notre propre école de danse. Notre crew est une famille, nous sommes fiers de le représenter depuis si longtemps, d'avoir grandi ensemble et de nous être battus pour en arriver là où nous en sommes actuellement. A l'époque, nous faisions nos répétitions dans le centre de jeune de Aigle, lieu qui n'est désormais plus adapté car il a déménagé dans un local trop petit. Nous sommes actuellement locataires dans une maison paroissiale, qui va malheureusement être détruite fin juin 2015 et nous faire nous retrouver à nouveau sans salle d'entrainement fixe, chose que nous ne pouvons plus nous permettre.  Notre objectif serait d'avoir un endroit stable et fixe où pouvoir danser librement sans se soucier des horaires et faire partager à tous nos jeunes notre amour pour la danse dans les meilleures conditions. Nous souhaiterions ouvrir un centre de danse dans la région d'Aigle, une salle avec un bon parquet, des miroirs, des vestiaires ect, enfin tout ce qui pourrait nous faire nous sentir chez nous et améliorer notre entrainement.  Notre art est souvent trop peu respecté par le manque de subventions qu'on lui propose ici et nous aimerions avec nos cours, notre générosité et notre envie de transmission, apporter aux jeunes, aux plus âgés, aux élèves et à tous ceux qui y trouveraient de l'intérêt, un moyen d'expression qui est le notre, qui nous a soudé et fait la force de notre crew depuis toutes ces années.Aigle, notre propre ville natale ne dispose malheureusement d'aucune autre salle pour nous aider pour la suite et nous devons trouver une solution pour éviter de se retrouver à la rue avec nos danseurs, car nous savons tous que notre vie est liée à la danse, que cette passion ne nous quittera jamais et que devons la préserver.

Avec l'école de danse KFM SCHOOL nous voulons changer notre rêve amateur en avenir professionnel en liant notre passion et les besoins qu'a la jeunesse de s'exprimer aujourd'hui, à travers la danse notammenr.

Story
“Record
deals, headlining tours, t-shirts with your face on. It’s gonna happen and when
it does you won’t ever have to send out another CV again” 
Unsigned is a
new play with music written and composed by Stephen Lloyd. Based on true
events, the story follows a band of South London musicians who, quite suddenly,
find themselves on the road to success. For some the success is far from
welcome and the natural dynamics of the group soon become strained and
fractured.
The piece
explores unemployment amongst young adults, the power of social media and
the ever-changing cogs of the music industry. 
A unique,
multi-media experience mixing theatre, digital video projections and live
original music. 
Unsigned has
been in development since August 2013. It was originally written as a TV Pilot
but was soon altered for the stage. 
In January
2015, Unsigned was selected from nearly 200 applicants to appear at the Black
Box Festival in Camden Town. The show performed to sell-out audiences under the company name Amplified Theatre. 
The piece received favourable reviews from
both the press and audiences:
 ""Unsigned
is an engaging, enjoyable and funny story full of relatable themes and
sentiment."" - Everything Theatre.
“The
characters and their separate plights were well written by Stephen Lloyd and
well defined by a cast who created a loveable motley crew whose lives were easy
to invest in for an hour and a half and enjoyable to watch.” - Everything
Theatre.
""A
funny and heartfelt play about the ups and downs of band life"" - Jamie
West, winner of the first Young Busker of the Year.
After the final performance, the cast took to the stage at an open mic event in a local bar and played through all of the songs from the show to an enthusiastic audience.
Following Unsigned's debut
at the Black Box Festival, the piece was picked up by Kevin Sutherland from KDB
Media and Ben Claybon, Associate Producer of the New Theatre Royal in
Portsmouth. Together, along with Amplified Theatre, we aim to bring the piece back for this year's Camden Fringe following an offer from the Tristan Bates Theatre
in London's West End. 
The plan is to produce the
play on a bigger scale, adding more songs and more video projections, sharing
the piece with a wider audience. We want to make theatre that is affordable,
accessible and attractive for the next generation of theatre-goers; creating
work for a diverse audience of both music lovers and frequent theatre
audiences. 
The piece will also allow us to showcase some of the city's best undiscovered talent, both on stage and off.
This new production of
Unsigned is due to run at the Tristan Bates Theatre on Monday 3rd to Saturday
8th August 2015 at 9.15pm and will last approximately 70 minutes with no
interval.
Unsigned is kindly
supported by the New Theatre Royal and the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts.
 
What We
Need & What You Get
In order to successfully bring Unsigned
back we need funding. Funding will pay for props, the set, costumes,
instruments, marketing, wages for the actors and crew and the hire fee of the
venue.
By helping fund this
exciting project, you will be part of a unique theatrical experience; an
original piece of new writing that we hope will inspire others to be creative during this current artistic recession where less and less
new work is being commercially produced.
It is important that new
voices are heard and that risks are being taken on new ideas.
By supporting Unsigned, you are supporting the future of contemporary British theatre. 
There are plenty of
exciting rewards on offer as a thank you for your contribution including
meeting the cast, signed scripts, programmes and even a guitar. There is also
an opportunity to visit rehearsals and watch a VIP preview of the production.
 
Risks
& Challenges
When Unsigned debuted at
the Black Box Festival, the project was produced entirely by Stephen Lloyd. He
designed all of the marketing material, ran the social media pages, sent out
casting breakdowns, made trailers, filmed and edited all of the scenes which
are shown during the show, all whilst continuing to work on the script, compose
and record the music, direct the show and organise all technical requirements.
He even carried a bass drum on four different buses across London. 
There were quite a few hurdles, mainly logistical. Now that the piece is being co-produced by KDB Media and Ben Claybon, this work can be evenly shared out.
Like every production,
especially with original work, the risks lie in box office takings. Will the show
sell? Will we get an audience? There is never a guarantee. Many commercial West
End productions close early for this very reason and new, original productions experience this most. To avoid this we plan to launch a strong marketing campaign through social
media, the distribution of posters and flyers, radio broadcasts and a number of 'pop-up' gigs, giving potential audiences a taste of the
show.

<p>Spillikin is a play about the near future, about memory, about humanity itself. It is also a deeply personal work, drawing on the experiences of the Pipeline team and of Alzheimer's carers and support networks around the country.  The themes also resonate on a societal level, as we confront the reality of an ageing population and turn to technology for support. The robot in Spillikin may seem a long way in in the future, but in fact we took only a few leaps to get there from the extant present.</p>

""Sally's confused. She's mislaid her husband. But there's a
robot in her living room and his voice is familiar.""



A confused elderly lady and a humanoid robot sing a fractured duet.
Out of this unfolds a human love story - the ultimate odd-couple
romance. 
In response to his wife's Alzheimer's diagnosis, an ailing obsessive archivist builds a perfected robotic version of himself, to be deployed after
his death: a patient carer, an aide-memoir, a singing partner, able
to give order to her confusion, and to bear without complaint the
endless repetition required to reassure her.
 As her mind deteriorates, their exchanges
acquire an odd poetry, a secret language expressed as a duet. And, on
some level, their love survives.

The idea
   
Spillikin is a play about the near future, about memory, about humanity itself. It is also a deeply personal work, drawing on the experiences of the Pipeline team and of Alzheimer's carers and support networks around the country.  The themes also resonate on a societal level, as we confront the reality of an ageing population and turn to technology for support. The robot in Spillikin may seem a long way in in the future, but in fact we took only a few leaps to get there from the extant present.

Funding gap 


£12300



Of course, on top of this, we also have to fulfil our backer rewards and perks, and pay our IndieGoGo fees! Which is why we're asking for at least £15000, to make sure you get what you want and we get what we need. All the money left over after fulfilment will be spent on the production costs of the play.


What can you get?

Let's get to the meat. What have we, the team, got for you, the backer?









Posters and t-shirts, all limited editions and brilliantly designed by Pipeline's graphic artist powerhouse.
Access to Engineered Arts' Virtual Robot software, where you can program and store your own RoboThespian routines.
Personalised thank-yous from the robot star, or even your own content programmed by us and performed by the robot, delivered to you via video.
Put your face on the robot! Digital immortality is just a button click away.
A projective head shell to hang on your wall and provide creative or technological inspiration.
Your name in the show programme - and for the very keen, an exclusive invitation behind the scenes at Edinburgh for a drink with the cast and a tete-a-tete with the robot.
Tour the RoboThespian factory in coastal Cornwall, a unique and unmissable experience.

You can even get your hands on a Socibot-Mini - a desktop-sized social robot with all the versatility and processing power of a full-sized RoboThespian. We'll let SB explain the details:





Where will the money go?




Amount raised


Fulfilment/ fees*


Remainder


What will we do?




<£15K


<£4950


<£10050


Walk to Edinburgh and Latitude – sleep in the van, eat beans and busk on the streets! But we won't lie, it will be tough.




£15K-£18K


£4200-£5000


£10800-£13000


Lets us properly pay our actors and director.




£18K+


£5K+


£13K+


Above this, all the money goes to more rehearsal time, upping the production values, set design, lighting – ie, making this the best show possible.





* 9% if we do not raise total requested, 4% for total raised + anything beyond.
Additionally, if we manage to raise more than anticipated, we have been invited to bring the play to a theatre in London, and work towards a regional tour.
We've made sure that no matter how much we raise, we can fulfil all our backer rewards. If we do raise less than our goal, we'll have to tighten our belts a bit and seek out other fundraising opportunities to fill the gap. The whole team is fully committed to bringing Spillikin to the stage - by whatever means possible. We hope if you're even as fraction as excited as we are, that you can spare a few quid to help us along the way.





'Spillikin' is a deeply personal project for us, and the character of Sally will resonate with anyone who has had to watch a loved one unravel due to Alzheimer's.
The development of Spillikins would not have been possible without the input and support of dementia patients, carers and experts, both local and from across the UK. Other Ways You Can Help Hey, sometimes you don't have any cash to spare! Believe me, in the theatre world we know all about that. But if you want to see us succeed and can help us out in other ways, that would be grand! Suggestions:  Tell people about the project. Share the fundraising link.
If you're near Edinburgh at Fringe time, pop along and see the play. or let people who are going know about it. The bigger the audience at the Fringe, the better the chance we'll be able to tour Spillikin nationally.",5.0,2,"1 Campaign

The Story

Growing up in the church choir of a small southern town, Jeremiah and Simon were very close. Jeremiah and Sarah were even closer. Promising a quick return, Jeremiah jumped at an opportunity to fill in for a few weeks as a back-up singer for a touring pop group. It would be some years before his friends would see him again. 
On the cusp of his first international tour, Jeremiah is adrift in superficial connections and professional relationships. He makes a surprise visit to his hometown on the eve of its centennial celebration. His surprise visit stirs things up. Belying the fans and fanfare, not everyone is happy to see him. Jeremiah is disappointed that Sarah and Simon have moved on, but is it love or just nostalgia? Is he running towards something he wants or running away from something he fears? The message of this romantic comedy is reflected in the style of its music – acappella.



The Music

Now every vision has a genesis! The musical numbers featured in the production are the celebrated songs of 'The Acappella Company' - more commonly known as 'Acappella'. The group has sold well over three million units and toured every continent on the globe since Keith Lancaster - songwriter, producer, and original lead singer - formed the group. Believing in the awesome versatility and flexibility of the human voice, this renowned vocal group can fill a large concert hall with beautiful, intricate music without ever plucking a string or beating a drum.

After a successful inaugural production of David Auburn's Proof last year in Pottstown, PA, the local community let us know they wanted more live theater.  So we're coming back, staging Annie Baker's gorgeous, Obie Award-winning play Circle Mirror Transformation on the same property.  We are extraordinarily lucky to have access to Sycamore Hill, a beautiful country home, which lets us take theater outside the theater and get up-close-and-personal with our audience. Sycamore Hill's porch, house, and surrounding environs were our set for Proof, and Circle Mirror Transformation will be performed outdoors on the property's lawn.Theater with a View is now a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a 501(c)(3) arts service organization, which means that any donations to TwaV are tax-deductible.  It also means that after our initial production, we have committed to taking Theater with a View to the next level and continuing to help actors and theater artists crack open fresh opportunities and create for the benefit of their communities, new audiences, and each other.  To meet audience demand, we've doubled our performances this year and spread them over two weeks.  But we need your help!  And we've got some fun perks lined up to show our gratitude.We are keeping our production slim and trim, but we aim to raise $9,000 to help cover unavoidable costs, including:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
</div>
<div>Hi, my name is Jason Karman and I'm a filmmaker in Vancouver, Canada. I've been writing-directing shorts for 10 years. 
As director, my works speak to the journey of
self, exploring how we communicate and where our place is in an ever-changing world. In my quest to reinvent and grow, dance has provided me with a new vocabulary by allowing a more vivid and truthful expression of self without the limitation of words. </div>

</div> <p>
</p>
<p>MUSE is a dance film about a
young man who discovers the stranger he is having a relationship with is his
future self. </p>
<p>The film cuts-in between a field,
a natural open space, and an intimate place that is darker and dreamlike. These
conflicting spaces are metaphors of our public and private thoughts. It is a commentary on the challenges of moving forward while aging; I find comfort in familiarity, but my curiosity invites opportunity and new challenges. </p>
<p>I have chosen stereoscopic 3D to increase the emotional transference between the dancers and audience. Accurate recreation of depth, volume and roundness brings audiences closer to dance. Tying the arc of the dancer's story with the intensity of the 3D allows for a more intense emotional journey. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The film starts with our young
man, Avery, walking in a field. He is following a path. He is curious about the
world and this curiosity creates a sense of magic realism that is communicated through
close-ups, a montage of the world. He meets Chauncey, a lonely stranger, and engages
him; the two begin to move together. The relationship starts to evolve as their
support for one another turns into a romantic connection, falling out of the
waking life into dream space.  Through the
loss of an outside background reference, the open field, the relationship
starts evolving. </p>
<p>Familiarity begins to permeate
through the relationship in the form of repetition. They are both striving to
build something together, but Chauncey doubts Avery. As scenes are
deconstructed, reality and dreams are blurred intensifying the effect that the
characters are transcending. Reality pushes into the dream, breaking it down, and
it takes its toll on Chauncey. Avery, the optimist, encounters resistance from
his stubborn companion. Through the use of a mirror in the dream space, Avery sees
his future self in Chauncey.</p>
<p>While they may have shared a
common goal (they are travelling on the same path), their perspectives change. By
building an association of the dream space with Avery’s face and reality to
Chauncey’s features, we create a visual language that these two are diverging. The
montage intensifies until Chauncey stops, his feet firmly rooted on the Earth.
Avery invites Chauncey to continue with him, but he does not move. We see them
shake hands outside. Both are enriched by the experience of being together, but
Avery chooses to move on; we follow him as he creates a different path. </p>

</h2>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style="""">The video above is a small example in which we introduce you to the universe of a new play that offers a tribute to theater and it highlights the profession of acting and the transcendence of its spirit beyond the stage.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The King of France</b> <span style="""">(El Rey de Francia) tells the story of a Shakespearean actor (Garrick) that starts to lose his mental sanity. Garrick confuses a young journalist (Alfredo) who seeks Garrick to interview him backstage with an actor who is expected to audition. In the middle of the interview– amid delusions and monologues of Shakespeare– the old man subjects him through several acting tests to prove his skills in the job; meanwhile the young man deals with personal doubts and insecurities and even though he has lived all his life dominated by fear, agrees to play along to get the interview he urgently need for his new job. The unexpected arrival of a young actress (Flora) will take the state of affairs to the limit causing a climax in the lives of both characters which will trade off fears, past loves, and secrets that will, along the narrative, drive to confront their inner demons in the middle of an interview that must take place and a show that must go on.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">The play is a dramatic comedy by Fermin Reina that –with your
contribution– will have a world premiere in the <i>V Festival de Teatro Hispano del Comisionado</i> <i>(Commissioners Hispanic Theater Festival) </i>that will take place in the
months of May and June of 2015. Our play will take place on <b>June 11th 2015</b>.<i><br/></i></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">
<b>The Commissioners Hispanic Theater Festival</b> The Festival is an exciting event that from its inception has dedicated itself to the purpose of recognizing and celebrating the contributions of the actor’s community in the Big Apple and its surrounding areas. The festival each year has a bigger impact in the Latino community in New York City and the event is promoted by the Dominican cultural commissioner of the United States.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In this 5th edition of the festival, we have been invited to participate along 23 other theatrical companies of New York and other cities of the United States and many other countries. It will be a joyous celebration of Hispanic American theater and we believe it is the perfect showcase to bring this theatrical piece to life. We are sure it will impact the hearts of our fellow actors and our beloved general public.<br/><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The artistic ensemble</b> of El Rey de Francia (The King of France) is integrated primarily by talented Venezuelans where most are residents of New York City.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This production will be co-directed by Dimas Gonzalez and Pablo Andrade, but assisted by the technical direction of Alfonso Rey, and assistant director Yessi Hernandez, music by Ruben Riera, makeup by Jose Miguel Dao, stage manager Maria Fernanda Padilla and associate producer Fernando Rendon..</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>This campaign</b> is to gather funds for the production and particularly the airfare expense of the actor and co-director Dimas Gonzalez that must be acquired in advance because of the economic crisis in Venezuela. The travel expense of Mr. Dimas Gonzalez is out of reach of our budget capability and with your generosity we can make this theatrical production a reality. We are offering free tickets for contributors of $20 or more among other series of additional great incentives. If you are unable to donate please help us spread the word of our wonderful and heartfelt project. Let not miss this great opportunity and experience! This artistic proposal comes from the most profound depths of our hearts and it is for you, the public. The following is an excerpt of the conversation that initiated this project, it is an email that Pablo Andrade wrote to Dimas Gonzalez (who was his first acting mentor) shortly after reading El Rey de Francia (The King of France). </p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Dimas, I have read the play and it has moved me. The theme is perfect for our artistic reunion. After so many years, to be on stage with you as Garrick, guiding my steps to defeat fear on stage and in life... it takes me back without a doubt to those first steps when I was still terrified, but with your assistance I dared to create. Presenting this play would be of great meaning for me at this stage of my career and this play is beyond any festival or recognition. My reward would be to leave my soul on stage at your side. Let’s do it!""</p></blockquote>

Help us bring this play to the Hispanic Theater Festival of New York



The video above is a small example in which we introduce you to the universe of a new play that offers a tribute to theater and it highlights the profession of acting and the transcendence of its spirit beyond the stage.
The King of France (El Rey de Francia) tells the story of a Shakespearean actor (Garrick) that starts to lose his mental sanity. Garrick confuses a young journalist (Alfredo) who seeks Garrick to interview him backstage with an actor who is expected to audition. In the middle of the interview– amid delusions and monologues of Shakespeare– the old man subjects him through several acting tests to prove his skills in the job; meanwhile the young man deals with personal doubts and insecurities and even though he has lived all his life dominated by fear, agrees to play along to get the interview he urgently need for his new job. The unexpected arrival of a young actress (Flora) will take the state of affairs to the limit causing a climax in the lives of both characters which will trade off fears, past loves, and secrets that will, along the narrative, drive to confront their inner demons in the middle of an interview that must take place and a show that must go on.



The play is a dramatic comedy by Fermin Reina that –with your
contribution– will have a world premiere in the V Festival de Teatro Hispano del Comisionado (Commissioners Hispanic Theater Festival) that will take place in the
months of May and June of 2015. Our play will take place on June 11th 2015.




The Commissioners Hispanic Theater Festival The Festival is an exciting event that from its inception has dedicated itself to the purpose of recognizing and celebrating the contributions of the actor’s community in the Big Apple and its surrounding areas. The festival each year has a bigger impact in the Latino community in New York City and the event is promoted by the Dominican cultural commissioner of the United States.
In this 5th edition of the festival, we have been invited to participate along 23 other theatrical companies of New York and other cities of the United States and many other countries. It will be a joyous celebration of Hispanic American theater and we believe it is the perfect showcase to bring this theatrical piece to life. We are sure it will impact the hearts of our fellow actors and our beloved general public.
The artistic ensemble of El Rey de Francia (The King of France) is integrated primarily by talented Venezuelans where most are residents of New York City.
The cast of three actors consists of Adriana Galindez, a beautiful and talented actress that recently moved to New York after acting in theater and television for a number of years in her native Venezuela; Pablo Andrade, who has been awarded with a 2015 Latin ACE Award and two 2014 HOLA Awards; and Dimas Gonzalez, who is one of the most important figures in theater and film in Venezuela. Mr. Dimas Gonzalez has been a recipient of more than 15 international and national artistic awards including Premio Nacional de Cine (2008), Best Actor in the International Film Festival of Milan and Festival of Breckenridge and Municipal Award of Film Roman Chalbaud (2010).
This production will be co-directed by Dimas Gonzalez and Pablo Andrade, but assisted by the technical direction of Alfonso Rey, and assistant director Yessi Hernandez, music by Ruben Riera, makeup by Jose Miguel Dao, stage manager Maria Fernanda Padilla and associate producer Fernando Rendon..
Produced by Corezon Productions and the
support of Venezuelan Arts Festival. 


Corezon Productions burst into the New York scene with force by showcasing Cuentos de Guerra para dormir en paz by Karin Valecillos, performing in HB Studio and in the IV Commissioners Hispanic Theater Festival being awarded 9 nominations including best production, direction, set and light design. . 



Venezuelan Arts Festival (VAF) was created with the mission to recognize the importance of Venezuelan art and to provide a platform to showcase it in New York and around the world. The VAF conducts annual events where it unites the best Venezuelan creativity abroad.


This campaign is to gather funds for the production and particularly the airfare expense of the actor and co-director Dimas Gonzalez that must be acquired in advance because of the economic crisis in Venezuela. The travel expense of Mr. Dimas Gonzalez is out of reach of our budget capability and with your generosity we can make this theatrical production a reality. We are offering free tickets for contributors of $20 or more among other series of additional great incentives. If you are unable to donate please help us spread the word of our wonderful and heartfelt project. Let not miss this great opportunity and experience! This artistic proposal comes from the most profound depths of our hearts and it is for you, the public. The following is an excerpt of the conversation that initiated this project, it is an email that Pablo Andrade wrote to Dimas Gonzalez (who was his first acting mentor) shortly after reading El Rey de Francia (The King of France). 

“Dimas, I have read the play and it has moved me. The theme is perfect for our artistic reunion. After so many years, to be on stage with you as Garrick, guiding my steps to defeat fear on stage and in life... it takes me back without a doubt to those first steps when I was still terrified, but with your assistance I dared to create. Presenting this play would be of great meaning for me at this stage of my career and this play is beyond any festival or recognition. My reward would be to leave my soul on stage at your side. Let’s do it!""

What We're Asking For: Living Space Players is asking for $4,000. Here's where your contribution will be going:  
Business expenses: Insurance, marketing and advertising. 
Artistic expenses: Props, costumes and other elements to increase production value and immerse you deeper into the worlds we create. 
Travel expenses: Transporting our trunk show performances to and from your home or provided space.

Pay for our actors and collaborators: The folks we work with are very talented and professional. Most important to us is to compensate them for their efforts.

Check out what we're offering for your donation on the Perks page!

Note about $10 perk: Please email livingspaceplayers@gmail.com with your song request!   Giving Back We want Living Space Players to build and strengthen communities and spread the art of theater as far and wide as possible. For every show you book and pay for, part of the profits from that performance will go towards donating shows, classes and workshops to community establishments! We're working to build relationships with various organizations such as community centers, schools, churches, shelters, charities and non-profits. Not only are we giving back to the community but so are you when you support us!   Some Challenges As with any new artistic and business venture, there are challenges such as:  Ensuring a mutual feeling of comfort and safety between L.S.P and you as our valued client. To facilitate this we will consult with you a minimum of two weeks in advance; and a final meeting a minimum of one week before your desired performance date. Dry spells. As with catering and other services similar to this, there are seasons where business will be slow. We will plan ahead financially for the slow seasons and continue to work hard on adding more shows and booking them.
Expanding as far and wide as possible. We have big goals for L.S.P. We want to make ourselves available to Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Long Island, the Hamptons, basically the entire state of New York! One of our long-term goals is to establish ourselves as a company in New York and then travel, creating Living Space Players artistic communities in other states, cities and eventually abroad!    Other Ways You Can Help If you're unable to make a donation, no worries! We understand times can be tough. Just taking a look at our page is appreciated. If you like who we are and what we want to do, here are some other ways you can help us out!  Share our campaign! Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your colleagues, tell ANYONE who might be interested!

<p>
We are a group of international students from
around the world who are studying acting at Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea.  This semester, we have decided to join our creative forces to create our own piece of theatre: <i>physical theatre</i>. 

We would like to create a new kind of work that
has never been seen in Korea before and we want our audience to experience
something they have never had the opportunity to experience before. Physical
theatre is a new idea for the theatre community in Korea, and by creating this
type of work, we are hoping to attract both the foreign and Korean communities
to share a unique theatre experience together. We believe that more than words,
our bodies can communicate to tell a story and send a stronger message that is
universal in thought and expression. </p>
<p>저희는 세계 각지에서 모여 한양대학교에서 연기를 공부하고 있는 국제 학생 단체입니다. 이번 학기에, 저희는 저희들끼리 작품을 만들 수 있는 기회를 받았습니다. 그래서 저희는 '신체극(Physical theatre)'을 만들기로 결정하였습니다. 저희가 신체극을 선택한 이유는 신체를 사용하여, 움직임에 집중되는 창조작업이 저희의 작품을 더 보편적이고 많은 사람들에게 전달할 수 있을 거라고 생각하였기 때문입니다. 그리고 색다른 스타일의 연극이 관객들에게 새로운 경험과 즐거움을 줄 것입니다.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>我們是來自世界各地的學生​​，現就讀於韓國漢陽大學的戲劇表演系。我們熱愛戲劇但作為留學生在韓國可以擁有自己的機會少之又少，但是這次我們成功向學校申請到了機會，以形體劇（physical theatre）的表演方式進行創作。但我們為什麼選擇形體劇？我們覺得利用肢體語言去表達可以擁有更多創造和想像空間，無需言語也可以向所有人傳達我們的內容和含義，給觀眾帶來全新的感受.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>What is Project Inferno</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Based on the classic piece of literature, <i>Dante’s Inferno</i>, we strive to create a
piece of theatre that is not only entertaining, but will also have an impact on
the people who watch it.  We are motivated
to ask the question of how people are living today and what type of society we
are creating. We feel that the idea that people need to experience hardship or
‘hell’ in order to reach satisfaction and happiness ‘heaven’ is a universal
message that everyone can relate to. By using the nine circles of Hell that
Dante describes, we will discuss the ideas of personal responsibility for our
actions and the results of the choices we make. We also want to explore the
idea of how our individual decisions affect not only ourselves, but also our
society and even our universe. We would like to share this message in hopes of
getting people to think about what kind of life we are living and how we can
become better people, not only for ourselves, but for our community, society
and world.</p>
<p>고전 문학인 단테의 &lt;신곡&gt;을 기반으로 하여, 저희는 관객들에게 메시지를 전달하기 위해 이 작품을 작업하고 있습니다. 저희는 ""사람들은 오늘날 어떻게 살고 있는가? 우리는 어떤 종류의 사회를 만들고 있는가?""에 대한 질문으로부터 출발하였으며, 사람들이 '천국'과 행복, 만족을 느끼기 위해서는 '지옥'과 어려움을 경험해야 한다고 생각합니다. 이것은 모든 사람들에게 통용되는 보편적 메시지입니다.<br/></p>

<p>As creative and resourceful students, we would like to keep
our budget to a minimum; however, there are some expenses that we cannot

We are not looking to make any profit from this project. We just want to create a meaningful piece of theatre that can be enjoyed by all who are a part of it. By donating to our project, we can achieve this dream together and create a very special experience for all to enjoy. </p>

What you donate to this campaign you will see when you come to our theatre - it goes to the costs of production and payroll for artists.  Philip and I serve YOU and making your experience in the theatre the best it can be and we spend many hours making sure what we spend and how we make budgetary decisions are always based on your theatre experience being EXTRAORDINARY at Stark Naked!  Artists being compensated a fair and equitable wage for their professional talents provides them with the support and work conditions they need to be able to produce the best artistic product in order to deliver to YOU the highest caliber theatrical event that you can experience.  Creativity does not come from depravation!  Now, what do we pay our artists..?  There is not one actor in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf making more than $300 a week....think about that...would you work for $300 a week (before taxes)???  Our designers and Directors and Stage Managers weekly wages fall in the $200 - $300 a week range as well.  We believe we can do better than that!!!  But right now we don't even know if we can raise the funds to cover this season.  We need your help!We recently made a capital improvement to the theatre so that your viewing experience would be better!  We bought $27,000 risers so that you could enjoy our extraordinary performances even more!  What that means is our ""wallet"" took a big hit and we need your help more than ever to get it filled up again to be able to meet payroll.  Come on out to the theatre and see how AMAZING it looks!!!  There is a picture of the theatre on the ""extras"" page so you can get a peak!WHY WE NEED YOUWe're a growing theatre and Houston's professional actors' theatre because of donors like you. This year, we've had to increase our budget by about 25% to both meet our increasing production needs and to continue to work toward our mission of paying artists a living wage - which we still aren't quite able to do.  This year we are also bringing you some amazing outside award winning artists and are putting in new studio risers to help improve your performance viewing experience all while keeping our ticket prices and concession prices low. We have expanded our development team to tackle these budgetary needs, and we hope that with this campaign, we can make sure we make it through this season into the next one.OUR FUTURETo tell you the Naked Truth: our future and growth is full of risk and possibilities. We hope that you will donate to this campaign to make sure we continue to contribute not only to Houston's thriving theatre scene, but also to the National stage as well.",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>This performance will include two couples.  3 Principle dancers and one soloist who regularly dance with NYCB and Stars of American Ballet.  <br/><br/>Stars of American Ballet travels to cities that rarely host ballet performances and offers top-notch choreography with principal and soloist-level dancers from major American companies. Founded and directed by New York City Ballet principal dancer Daniel Ulbricht, who works alongside Executive Director Andrew Robertson, Stars also sponsors dance education programs, consisting of master classes, pre-performance lectures and community outreach projects, to build a better awareness and overall experience with the art form, and offers free tickets for underprivileged children.<br/><br/>The mission of Stars of American Ballet is to one day see all parts of this country entertained, educated, lifted up and inspired by the art of ballet and great dancing, delivered to anyone, anywhere who wishes to share this experience.<br/><br/>Proceeds from this performance will go to support the Southern Vermont Dance Festival!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>This is such an amazing opportunity!  This is what we need to make this happen and this is what you will see as the result!<br/><ul>
<li>We need to raise a minimum of $10,000 dollars for Theater Rental, Housing for the dancers, Travel for dancers, Artist Fees, Costume Rentals and Royalties. If we raise more it will go to promoting, reception, scholarships for SVDF and more.</li>
<li>There are amazing perks such as: Meet the dancers (How often do you get the chance to meet and schmooze with professional Ballet Dancers, Wonderful Reception, Naming the theater, Tickets to the Show, Priority Seating, Signed and autographed photo of the dancers, Southern Vermont Dance Festival Pass's, tickets to SVDF galas and more!  As you can see there is a lot of benefit to giving to this event.</li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal we will still bring an amazing company to SVDF this year with the money raised!  So it is a win win!! However, lets go ahead and reach our goal and bring Professional ballet dancers to our small town.<br/>
</li>
</ul>The Impact </div><div>
<p>This project is important because thanks to Southern Vermont Dance Festival and all of the amazing dance programs in our area such as: Vermont Performance Lab, Brattleboro School of Dance, Sobo Studio, IBIT Dance Company and Keleido Dance, Brattleboro is becoming a dance hub for New England.  Whether people just come for the summer festival or they travel to our town for one of the incredible performances that happen throughout the year, our town is getting more traffic because we are known as a hub for dance.  </p>
<p>Here is what bringing Principals from major Ballet Companies will do for our town:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give our town major exposure in the dance world which will help get people to our classes, performances and most importantly it will inspire people from around the country to contribute funding to our programs.</li>
<li>Bring people to our town to shop and eat!  The more major events that happen in Brattleboro, the more feet on the street.  This is 50% of the goal of the Southern Vermont Dance Festival and now we are bringing this benefit throughout the whole year.  4 days is just not enough!

</div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Short Summary The Southern Vermont Dance Festival is working is working to host Daniel Ulbricht, Principal for the New York City Ballet and his dancers in Brattleboro Vermont on April 20th.  The dancers will perform at the beautiful and historic Latchis Theater!  We have not before had the opportunity to host such amazing professional ballet in Brattleboro.  In order to make this happen we need your support!
This performance will include two couples.  3 Principle dancers and one soloist who regularly dance with NYCB and Stars of American Ballet.  Stars of American Ballet travels to cities that rarely host ballet performances and offers top-notch choreography with principal and soloist-level dancers from major American companies. Founded and directed by New York City Ballet principal dancer Daniel Ulbricht, who works alongside Executive Director Andrew Robertson, Stars also sponsors dance education programs, consisting of master classes, pre-performance lectures and community outreach projects, to build a better awareness and overall experience with the art form, and offers free tickets for underprivileged children.The mission of Stars of American Ballet is to one day see all parts of this country entertained, educated, lifted up and inspired by the art of ballet and great dancing, delivered to anyone, anywhere who wishes to share this experience.Proceeds from this performance will go to support the Southern Vermont Dance Festival!
  What We Need & What You GetThis is such an amazing opportunity!  This is what we need to make this happen and this is what you will see as the result!
We need to raise a minimum of $10,000 dollars for Theater Rental, Housing for the dancers, Travel for dancers, Artist Fees, Costume Rentals and Royalties. If we raise more it will go to promoting, reception, scholarships for SVDF and more.
There are amazing perks such as: Meet the dancers (How often do you get the chance to meet and schmooze with professional Ballet Dancers, Wonderful Reception, Naming the theater, Tickets to the Show, Priority Seating, Signed and autographed photo of the dancers, Southern Vermont Dance Festival Pass's, tickets to SVDF galas and more!  As you can see there is a lot of benefit to giving to this event.
If we do not reach our goal we will still bring an amazing company to SVDF this year with the money raised!  So it is a win win!! However, lets go ahead and reach our goal and bring Professional ballet dancers to our small town.

The Impact 
This project is important because thanks to Southern Vermont Dance Festival and all of the amazing dance programs in our area such as: Vermont Performance Lab, Brattleboro School of Dance, Sobo Studio, IBIT Dance Company and Keleido Dance, Brattleboro is becoming a dance hub for New England.  Whether people just come for the summer festival or they travel to our town for one of the incredible performances that happen throughout the year, our town is getting more traffic because we are known as a hub for dance.  
Here is what bringing Principals from major Ballet Companies will do for our town:

Give our town major exposure in the dance world which will help get people to our classes, performances and most importantly it will inspire people from around the country to contribute funding to our programs.
Bring people to our town to shop and eat!  The more major events that happen in Brattleboro, the more feet on the street.  This is 50% of the goal of the Southern Vermont Dance Festival and now we are bringing this benefit throughout the whole year.  4 days is just not enough! We want people shopping and eating throughout the entire year!
Expose people to a type of dance that is not often available in our area.  Professional ballet usually means traveling to a major city!  What if we could offer that in our town!  Thus exposing our young people and adults to something that is not always available to them.  

Put's us on the map for dance and other cultural events!  Makes us, Brattleboro, not just a high ranking visual arts community, but, also exposes us as the high ranking performing arts community that we are.
Allows us to bring more of this type of dance to SVDF and beyond!  Shows the community that they do in fact want to support dance!!

    ChallengesThere are some challenges to bringing people of this caliber to the Latchis
The stage is not a huge and ""normal"" dance stage.  Finding companies and professionals that are willing to go out on that limb is rare.  However, once one company does this, many will follow!  So if we build it, they will come!
Money is a huge challenge.  To bring these major companies, we have to raise money.
Once we see these dancers, we will be hooked!  We will have to be able to find a way to bring these types of dancers again and again to Brattleboro!


  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

 Volunteer for this event

 Volunteer to help us with the entire festival
be on the planning committee and help us continue to bring things like this to the town.
Be on the production team for the show.
Help us promote this show and sell out the seats.

<div>  Stewart Yaros, founder of Dance International, has been teaching dancers of all ages and levels in Austin for over 20 years. Dance International expanded its mission and purpose and became a 501 (c) (3) in 2011, in order to broaden DI's role in the community, and elevate the culture of Austin by offering more classes, organizing a variety of beautiful events,  and bringing world-class performers and teachers to Austin for the public to enjoy. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The organization continues to grow, and has finally found a studio space that is all our own! We're now offering classes in youth dance, adult dance, and mind-body health from 6am-midnight.  Classes range from early morning meditation and yoga, to children's hip hop and ballet, to salsa dancing. Most evenings, we also hold specialized dance socials, such as Tango Milonga on Wednesdays, and Latin Dance Night on Saturdays. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Until now, DI had sublet three separate studio spaces on a part-time basis, which was a challenge because we were always planning around the schedules of the primary owners/tenants, and were limited in our ability to grow into a true community arts, dance, and health center. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The new studio is conveniently located in north central Austin, surrounded my a mix of commercial, medical, and residential properties. We offer special rates for all of our neighbors, in an effort to make Dance International a unique community destination. </div>

</div></div>","PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Renegade Performance Group (RPG) is presenting The AFROFUTURISM Series with two unique full-length programs: “Untitled Distances” and “The Inscription Project,” introducing dance and technology as a vehicle of AFROFUTURISM.  This will be the first RPG season in our home borough- Brooklyn. The company season runs for four nights, November 4-7, 2015, at the Irondale Center in Fort Greene. AFROFUTURISM as a movement, expresses new narratives, ideologies, and symbolisms of Black culture from a global perspective.RPG launched the AFROFUTURISM Series in January 2014 to be an ongoing project investigating the presence of Blackness into and beyond 21st Century techno-culture and society. It is a platform where themes and contexts of Black diasporic culture will be remixed and reimagined through contemporary dance, digital projections, and interactive sound environments.

THE MUSICAL - 10 wonderful, happy and creative years in the making. It began when Deb Silver, our composer, lyricist, writer and producer, fell in love with David Lean’s 1954 movie Hobson’s Choice starring Sir Charles Laughton and Sir John Mills.  She took her idea to theater and film professionals in New York in 2005. And from there the ideas blossomed.  10 years, 27 songs, sold out staged readings and standing ovations (with such a profound response the last show had to be moved to a larger Off Broadway theater), now, here we are.  <div>

</div></div>","THIS LIFE! THE MUSICAL - 10 wonderful, happy and creative years in the making. It began when Deb Silver, our composer, lyricist, writer and producer, fell in love with David Lean’s 1954 movie Hobson’s Choice starring Sir Charles Laughton and Sir John Mills.  She took her idea to theater and film professionals in New York in 2005. And from there the ideas blossomed.  10 years, 27 songs, sold out staged readings and standing ovations (with such a profound response the last show had to be moved to a larger Off Broadway theater), now, here we are.  



We've assembled a team of 14 incredibly talented actors, singers, a superb choreographer, a next level set and costume designer, an exceptional musical director, and our very own incomparable director, Terrence Montgomery, who has been with us since 2009. 
We are ready to take NYC by storm with a 3 week AEA showcase opening on November 2nd, the 100 year anniversary of the opening of “Hobson’s Choice” on Broadway, at the Desotelle theater in the Times Square Arts Center! 
But, we can’t do it alone. We need to raise $37,500 dollars to help cover the additional costs of the showcase and WE NEED YOUR HELP to do so!



THIS LIFE! a love story set in 1875 Victorian England, follows Maggie, as she takes care of her two younger sisters and her alcoholic father.  Never having a life of her own, Maggie finally makes a choice for herself that transforms her life and the lives of everyone around her.Based on the play “""Hobson’s Choice”"" by Harold Brighouse, the comedy and romance of “THIS LIFE!” is delightfully enriched with Deb Silver’'s memorable compositions, blending the musical styles of “Gilbert & Sullivan” and “The Beatles.” “.. Highly hummable and deeply satisfying..”


 Deb Silver is the composer, lyricist, and librettist of THIS LIFE! The Musical.  She is a jazz vocalist, composer and theater performer living and working in the United States and England.  In her work as a published songwriter, and recording artist,  Deb performs regularly at private parties and cabarets. She gave a successful sneak preview to  Prince William’s VIP guests at Kensington Palace of her latest Album ""In Spring"". Deb’s achievements include three one-woman musical shows, original songs which have been featured in independent films,  and as a vocalist in numerous bands and on studio albums.  Deb is the founder and director of the Silver Voice Method.

Terrence Montgomery is a theatre director, actor, acting coach and teacher in NYC. He has worked as a director, lighting designer, stage technician, stage manager and actor in productions for Music Theater of Wichita, the Goodman Theater in Chicago, in NYC at The Public Theater, Carnegie’s Weill Recital Hall and Zankel Hall, at BMCC and Dance Theater Workshop, as well as in theatres in Denmark, Scotland, Russia, Poland, Georgia and Romania.











What more could you want than to be right in the heart of it all?  And John DeSotelle Main Theater is!  Located in the Times Square Arts Center, this 50+ seat theater is on the corner of 8th Avenue and 43rd Street, right in the theater district!

“Overseas

<p>
Conditioned
to her London lifestyle she's left feeling lost and frustrated in an
alien land fighting to hold on to who she really is. But what awaits

<p>
Through
the play you will see a collation of Nigerian boarding school
experiences through the eyes of a British-born Nigerian called Olu. Comedy,
emotion and spoken word are found throughout Olu's culture shock, she
is known as ""Oyinbo"" (white person) to her classmates and she has a lot to learn about their differences and similarities.</p>
<p>
We
meet Mr Johnson, a charming and warm teacher who reveals to Olu the
pride he has in his own heritage. And to top it off, there is great drama and controversy when the Principals schemes come to fruition.</p>
<p>
Olu
is a poignant play that tackles the themes of identity, heritage and
the displacement we fell when we are forced to leave our home. The
play openly debate the media's perception on the Chobok girls'
stories and how the public react to it both in the UK and in Nigeria,
and most importantly, should we do more to rescue these girls?</p>
<p>
The
passion behind staging OLU comes from an overwhelming plight of
wanting to bring awareness to the 219 Chibok schoolgirls that were
abducted in 2014 by the terrorist group Boko Haram, they are yet to
be found and returned to their families.</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">""Fund the Furry"" is our new Indiegogo campaign for the upcoming project ""Dances for Intimate Spaces and Friendly People."" A two-fold project produced and presented by the new Gibney Dance Center at 280 Broadway and taking place September 2nd to October 3rd. This project is structured as one week of performances (9/30-10/1-3) and a month-long installation at the new Center’s gallery that opens September 2nd. </span><br/></p>
<p>This project explores ways that dance making, dance, dancers, furries and spectators are impacted by different viewing perspectives. Conventional viewing of dance has been challenged since the 1960s when museums and galleries started presenting dance. The proximity of studio viewing of intricate physical relationships offered by this project challenges illusions of idealized bodies produced by the proscenium stage. Continuing the investigation between viewing and viewed, this project’s multiple facets (individual and simultaneous studio installation; group experience; Furry as interlocutor/curator, gallery exhibit) re-frame questions of perspective, location, presence, and the politics of bodies in performance within the context of contemporary culture. </p>
<p>The performance component of Dances will be presented simultaneously in 4 individual studios with the audience sequentially rotating from studio to studio and experiencing one individual dance vignette at a time. As the evening’s culmination, each installation’s highlighted episodes will be simultaneously displayed side by side at the Center’s larger studio C. This finale is conceived as an antidote to the isolated studio viewing experience, offering viewers the experience of witnessing up close previously set studio material, through a structured improvisation score, merged with other studio material which will transform into new performances. </p>

<br/></div>","""Fund the Furry"" is our new Indiegogo campaign for the upcoming project ""Dances for Intimate Spaces and Friendly People."" A two-fold project produced and presented by the new Gibney Dance Center at 280 Broadway and taking place September 2nd to October 3rd. This project is structured as one week of performances (9/30-10/1-3) and a month-long installation at the new Center’s gallery that opens September 2nd. 
This project explores ways that dance making, dance, dancers, furries and spectators are impacted by different viewing perspectives. Conventional viewing of dance has been challenged since the 1960s when museums and galleries started presenting dance. The proximity of studio viewing of intricate physical relationships offered by this project challenges illusions of idealized bodies produced by the proscenium stage. Continuing the investigation between viewing and viewed, this project’s multiple facets (individual and simultaneous studio installation; group experience; Furry as interlocutor/curator, gallery exhibit) re-frame questions of perspective, location, presence, and the politics of bodies in performance within the context of contemporary culture. 
The performance component of Dances will be presented simultaneously in 4 individual studios with the audience sequentially rotating from studio to studio and experiencing one individual dance vignette at a time. As the evening’s culmination, each installation’s highlighted episodes will be simultaneously displayed side by side at the Center’s larger studio C. This finale is conceived as an antidote to the isolated studio viewing experience, offering viewers the experience of witnessing up close previously set studio material, through a structured improvisation score, merged with other studio material which will transform into new performances. 
Designed by video artist Peter Richards, the exhibit that accompanies the performance component, presents a visual record produced during the DIP residency, contextualizing the involved artists’ process in relationship to post/modern dance history. The exhibit and its accompanying catalogue call into question the art museum’s framing of people, bodies, furries, and dance as valuable art objects and instead propose a return to the personal  as political. This exhibit will be opened to the public during the day from September 2nd to October 3rd at the Center’s gallery.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Wide Eyed Productions exists to bring brave, bold and
culturally relevant new texts to production. With a core ensemble of emerging
theatre artists, we are dedicated to leaving our audience Wide Eyed.</p>
<p>This year will mark Wide Eyed Productions’ eighth
anniversary, and we have an awesome <i>Summer
Season of Fun</i> planned for NYC. Not only are we continuing to produce our
WINKS Staged Reading Series, which showcases three emerging playwrights once a
month, we also have two amazing shows featured in the Samuel French OOB
Festival 2015, and are in pre-production for our first webseries.</p>
<p>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</p>
<p>Clearly we know how to have “fun”!...but all this fun comes with
a price. The nature of the festival, web series and reading series is that they
are not designed to make revenue. Instead they are platforms for Wide Eyed
Productions to be brave and bold and to work with new and amazing artists.</p>
<p>Although these are not revenue generating, there are costs
($3200) to having all this fun. Theater is always expensive to produce,
especially for nonprofits, and we need your help to ensure that not only WE
have a great summer, but that YOU have a great summer.  What is in it for

<p>THE IMPACT</p>
<p>Wide Eyed has been producing prolifically since 2007 and
officially incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit in 2013. We have produced
many shows in many theatres throughout the years, and are proud to be a part of
the vibrant NYC indie theatre community. From our very first production of <i>The
Medea,</i> to the quirky tale of <i>A Devil Inside,</i> to the classic <i>One Flew Over the</i> <i>Cuckoos Nest,</i>
and to the numerous new works from up-and-coming playwrights that have graced
our stages, our shows speak for themselves. We continue to look forward to
serving the NYC community and continue to generate exciting, thought-provoking
theatrical works.</p>
<p>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</p>
<p>When entering into any production, whether for one show or
for an entire <i>Summer Season of Fun</i>,
there will always be risks. Luckily, Wide Eyed Productions has a strong Board
of Directors and a talented core ensemble that continues to rise to the
occasion. In the last two years, we have made the conscious effort, spear-headed
by our Board, to scale back our seasons and focus upon the business side of
production. Our finances have never looked quite so promising as they do now,
but we realize that in order for us to continue to operate in the black, we
need to raise some green.</p>

<h3>Why does it matter?</h3>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Witness the Beginning</i> is a cultural call to arms that can influence the fate of life on planet earth. We as a creative team believe it is not enough just to create theatre that discusses the various issues plaguing our natural ecosystem. By creating an immersive experience, we’re taking a necessary step to help our audience viscerally understand humanity's effect on mother earth.</p>
<p>As a team, we’re building on a theatrical style that started with <i>Conquest</i>, an immersive experience that investigated the reasons for and often-violent effects of cultural misunderstanding. With <i>Conquest</i>, we succeeded in creating a performance that was riveting, inspiring, and thought provoking.</p>
<p><i>Witness the Beginning </i>is our way of responding to the most pressing issue facing the modern world. Only by understanding humanity in its purest form can we as artists ask: How and why do humans destroy our natural environment, even when it prevents our chances of long-term survival?</p>
<p>In addition, by supporting <i>Witness the Beginning</i>, you are doing more than just helping us mount one production. Your support for Witness the Beginning is an important first step in the creation of a new artistic collective committed to bringing high quality, exciting, and socially relevant artistic experiences to life. </p>
<p>But we can’t do this without you! Even a $5 contribution will help us bring this essential production to New York and will help our collective hit the ground running.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Wilfried Souly, but everyone calls me Willy. I am a dancer and choreographer of contemporary and experimental African dance from Burkina Faso, living in LA. I’ve performed all over the world in my own work and the work of others.  I am on teaching faculty at UCLA World Arts and Culture and have a long-running community class at Your Neighborhood Dance Studio. I have been very fortunate to make my life through dance.  Now I am exploring how my identity, any identity is formed in arriving, in achieving, in becoming. And I am doing it at the NOW Festival on August 4. I’m asking for your help in raising $5000 to cover the costs of lightening programmer, live musical accompaniment, and salary for the dancers to augment the honorarium provided by REDCAT.</p>
<p>I am honored to have the opportunity to present at the NOW Festival at REDCAT for a third time. This is not an occurrence afforded to many artists in Los Angeles. I am devoted to bringing something new, unusual and intriguing. This piece is a new departure, officially launching my dance company, Souly Dance Arts. I want it to be both beautiful and compelling in all aspects.</p>
<p>Rehearsals are well underway. I am having a great time with Aaron Mason, Abagail Fritz, Sheena Young, Yu Sugisaka in the studio. We are looking forward to adding in our musicians, Julio Montero and Thomas Moose. Boubacar Djiga is headed to a recording studio in Burkina to record special music and sound for our soundscape. Things are coming together!</p>
<p> Lighting is a crucial element of this new work. Carol McDowell has agreed to once again design the lights for my show. I am very lucky! I have already earned the support of LIFX, a company that produces light bulbs that can be controlled by your mobile phone. They donated 24 of the Color 1000 bulbs to perform alongside the dancers and musicians! Now, I need to hire a developer to work with the bulbs and Carol to design a score for the lights in the way I envision.</p>
<p>It takes a team to make brilliant work. I’m focused on delivering just that. This is where you come in.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need a total of $7000 to cover costuming, dancer salary for 5 performers, lighting designer flat fee, developer flat fee for LIFX custom app, runs to Home Depot to buy materials for rigs for LIFX bulbs, fee for drummers, flat fee for set designer to construct interactive rigs for bulbs. <strong>I am asking you to help me with $5,000 of that.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s the break down of what your contribution will cover:</p>
<p>Smart Light app $ 300.00</p>
<p>Costumes $ 375.00</p>
<p>Set $ 325.00</p>
<p>Artists salary $ 4,000.00</p>
<p>Total : = $5000</p>
<p>If I do not meet my goal, the show will go on. We already have the bulbs in hand and can make use of the native app that comes with them. Fundraising will continue to offset my out-of-pocket expenses because I will just dance harder to cover what I need. </p>
<p>Should I be so fortunate as to go OVER my goal, I will pay a professional  video editor to work on the footage that REDCAT will provide…and maybe I will even pay myself…</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>I am a big believer in being present, in showing up and sweating together. My perks are few, but mighty! I have a custom designed silk-screened t-shirt with my new company’s logo available in black with a gold image. These are limited edition; there are only 100 of them. The T-shirt will become your ticket to some other cool perks.  I hope you can identify with them.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Too often, we independent choreographers ask dancers to work with us for little to no rehearsal pay, and then a small fee each night of the performance. Your support of this campaign will help me begin my company on the right foot, paying my dancers, musicians and team members. Up to now, I have done this out of my own pocket. Helping me cover these costs is an investment in dance arts and education in Los Angeles: the money given to the dancers will in turn support other artists and their communities. This is how we roll, as people say here in the US!</p><p>Your support will also help me create a new medium of exploration for my students at UCLA: the LIFX bulbs will become part of the instructional tools at World Arts and Cultures. The rigs and apps built for the piece will continue to be used to experiment with contemporary expressions of culture on the western coast of the continent of Africa. This is personally very exciting for me.</p><p>I would like to signal “experimental” with more than a combination of modern dance and traditional Manding dance from Burkina.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">From the company that brought you <i>Bear Ass</i> and <i>The Witch and Bitch Sessions</i> comes a campy and incredibly fun musical with a distinctly female voice: <strong><i><a href=""http://www.25thstreettheatre.org/paypal/theatre17/the-inconquerable-faith/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Inconquerable Faith of Gladys Struthers and Others</a> </i></strong>written by Kelly McTaggart and with music by Miranda Hughes at the <strong>2017 Saskatoon Fringe Theatre Festival in Victoria Upstairs from August 3rd - August 12th.</strong></p>
<p>This quirky play centres around the rivalry of two suburban neighbours, Gladys and Patti, and their teenagers, Joanie and Skyler. At the upcoming talent show, both mothers plan to out-parent the other with the amazing talent of their progeny. With the weight of their mother's expectations on their shoulders, Joanie and Skyler hope to “just get by”, someday move out, and maybe even share a first kiss.</p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>EvilStick Productions is a female-run company in Saskatoon that strives to bring heartwarming and provocative entertainment to the Canadian theatre scene in our own particular shade of silly. We believe in delivering irreverent humour while providing opportunities for women and emerging artists of all genders, ages, disabilities, or ethno-cultural identities.</p>

<h3>More About the Show</h3>
<p>Kelly wrote<i><strong> The Inconquerable Faith of Gladys Struthers and Others</strong></i> over 2 years ago during the Saskatchewan Playwright Centre’s 24 Hour Playwriting Competition, where her work earned her 1st place in the student category and 2nd overall. Since then, <b><i>Gladys</i></b> has been worked on with Saskatchewan theatre professionals and emerging artists, and was most recently workshopped at the 2016 Spring Festival of New Plays where it was well received.</p>
<p><strong>Come see <i>Gladys</i><i> </i>at the 2017 Saskatoon Fringe Theatre Festival in Victoria Upstairs:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thursday, August 3  – 8:50pm-9:50pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Saturday, August 5 –  4:10pm-5:10pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sunday, August 6 –  7:40pm-8:40pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, August 8 – 9:35pm-10:35pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thursday, August 10 –  5:55pm-6:55pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Friday, August 11 – 7:40pm-8:40pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Saturday, August 12 – 5:55pm-6:55pm</strong></p>
<h3>What are we using the money for?</h3>
<p>We're making theatre, which means buying costumes, building a set, covering production costs, promoting the hell out of our show, and *hopefully* feeding our artists who are working tirelessly to make this the best EvilStick production yet! If we go above and beyond our fundraising goals, the leftover money will be going toward touring <strong><i>Gladys</i> </strong>around Canada next year and building a nest egg for our company. </p>
<p>Below is a breakdown on some of the costs associated with this production:</p>
<p><strong>Posters </strong>$65 through Vistaprint</p>
<p><strong>Handbills </strong>$75 through Vistaprint </p>
<p><strong>Rehearsal Space </strong>$50 non-refundable deposit for a key to our rehearsal space</p>
<p><strong>Props</strong> $100 </p>
<p><strong>Costume Design </strong>$300 as designed by Miranda Hughes</p>
<p><strong>Set Design </strong>$400 as designed by Jillian Borrowman</p>
<p><strong>Travel </strong>$1,385 to cover the flights from Toronto to Saskatoon for Miranda and Kelly as estimated through WestJet</p>
<p><b>Saskatoon Fringe Administration Fee </b>$730</p>
<p><b>Artist Fees* </b>$13,970 </p>
<p>We are proud to say that we are partnering with <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/OpenStorefront/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Open Storefront Project</a>, which has allowed us a free space to rehearse throughout the month of July. If you aren't familiar with them, please check them out! They provide amazing opportunities for artists in Saskatoon.</p>
<p>* Artist fees are estimated using CAEA ""G"" House wage guidelines at $628/week for our four actors throughout our 4 weeks of rehearsals and one week of shows. In addition, our director would be paid a sum of $1,409.50 using CAEA ""G"" House wage guidelines. This is very important to us because it means paying our artists a living wage. We are hoping to get as close to this goal as possible through our fundraising efforts and are happy to answer any questions you may have regarding the work of an actor, director, designer, etc. and how the Canadian Actor's Equity Association comes up with their numbers. </p>
<h3>What will you get out of it?</h3>
<p>Other than that great feeling you get when supporting local art, you will be helping us produce our show - this won't only help to build a strong theatre community, but it will make you a valuable part of it. You will also be the first to receive perks and information on upcoming EvilStick events and shows.  Speaking of perks, we will be accepting contributions up until the end of our run at the 2017 YXE Fringe, and boy do we have some cool things up for grabs:</p>
<ul>
<li>EvilStick/<strong><i>Gladys</i></strong> buttons</li>
<li>
<span>Signed </span><i style=""font-weight: bold;"">Gladys</i> posters</li>
<li>EvilStick T-shirts (yes, they will be tie dyed)</li>
<li>Tickets to our show</li>
<li>A portrait painted of your beautiful mug by one of EvilStick's founding members</li>
<li>Shout outs at our show and on social media</li>
<li>Producer status</li>
<li>A private show (and get this) <i>anywhere</i> you want</li>
<li>Our undying love and support &lt;3</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why should you support <i>this </i>show?</h3>
<p>EvilStick Productions is proudly in its third season, which means we have a solid past together where we have written, directed, and acted in successful shows. This year, we are stepping up our game, and with a fully formed script written by Kelly McTaggart, music by Miranda Hughes, and the wonderful Jillian Borrowman directing us, we are set up for our best year ever. Having already workshopped this script with the Saskatoon and Regina theatre communities, we have had successful feedback and are now ready and excited to bring this show to life at the 2017 Saskatoon Fringe. We have our show, we have a strong bond as a group of hard-working individuals, and we have a fully-formed vision. All we need is your contribution!</p>
<h3>But <i>*gasp*</i> what about the risks!?</h3>
<p>With any art venture, there are bound to be risks! We have faced many of them over the last two years, and are well on our way to overcoming a few that have already been thrown at us this year. With that being said, we have a fully-formed show, a strong vision, and we have our spot at the Saskatoon Fringe. There is nothing stopping us from putting up an amazing show, but what will bring it to the next level is the community support needed to make it truly shine (paper bag costumes and cardboard instruments will not stop us from putting this show up, but we would appreciate some real clothes, thx).</p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","From the company that brought you Bear Ass and The Witch and Bitch Sessions comes a campy and incredibly fun musical with a distinctly female voice: The Inconquerable Faith of Gladys Struthers and Others written by Kelly McTaggart and with music by Miranda Hughes at the 2017 Saskatoon Fringe Theatre Festival in Victoria Upstairs from August 3rd - August 12th.
This quirky play centres around the rivalry of two suburban neighbours, Gladys and Patti, and their teenagers, Joanie and Skyler. At the upcoming talent show, both mothers plan to out-parent the other with the amazing talent of their progeny. With the weight of their mother's expectations on their shoulders, Joanie and Skyler hope to “just get by”, someday move out, and maybe even share a first kiss.
Who are we?
EvilStick Productions is a female-run company in Saskatoon that strives to bring heartwarming and provocative entertainment to the Canadian theatre scene in our own particular shade of silly. We believe in delivering irreverent humour while providing opportunities for women and emerging artists of all genders, ages, disabilities, or ethno-cultural identities.

The Team
Jillian Borrowman is a founding member of EvilStick Productions and will be directing Gladys. Her select directing credits include With Glowing Hearts for Obiz Productions, Dr. Frightful Presents: Dead Air for Neverending Highway Productions, and Bear Ass for EvilStick Productions. She also stage managed The River for Channel Theatre, With Glowing Hearts for Obiz Productions, Bear Ass for EvilStick Productions, and Into The Woods for Greystone Theatre. 
Miranda Hughes is a founding member of EvilStick Productions and will be playing Patti in Gladys. Select acting credits include Straight Up for Small But Mighty, The River for Channel Theatre, Danny King of the Basement and Undercover for Persephone Theatre, Bear Ass for EvilStick Productions, and Madama Butterfly and Carmen for the Saskatoon Opera. 
Lauren May is a founding member of EvilStick Productions and will be playing Joanie in Gladys. Her select credits include Peter and the Starcatcher for Globe Theatre, Hypneurosis for It's Not a Box Theatre, Bear Ass for EvilStick Productions, Madama Butterfly for the Saskatoon Opera, Downstream for the Global Institute for Water Security, and Money Don't Grow on Trees for Neverending Highway Productions.

Along with being a company member of Free Flow Dance Centre, Mitchell is a poet and musician in the Saskatoon arts community who loves to collaborate and create new work and was a finalist in Saskatoon's Tonight It's Poetry 2016.
Kelly McTaggart is a founding member of EvilStick Productions and will be playing the title role in Gladys.

More About the Show
Kelly wrote The Inconquerable Faith of Gladys Struthers and Others over 2 years ago during the Saskatchewan Playwright Centre’s 24 Hour Playwriting Competition, where her work earned her 1st place in the student category and 2nd overall. Since then, Gladys has been worked on with Saskatchewan theatre professionals and emerging artists, and was most recently workshopped at the 2016 Spring Festival of New Plays where it was well received.
Come see Gladys at the 2017 Saskatoon Fringe Theatre Festival in Victoria Upstairs:
Thursday, August 3  – 8:50pm-9:50pm
Saturday, August 5 –  4:10pm-5:10pm
Sunday, August 6 –  7:40pm-8:40pm
Tuesday, August 8 – 9:35pm-10:35pm
Thursday, August 10 –  5:55pm-6:55pm
Friday, August 11 – 7:40pm-8:40pm
Saturday, August 12 – 5:55pm-6:55pm
What are we using the money for?
We're making theatre, which means buying costumes, building a set, covering production costs, promoting the hell out of our show, and *hopefully* feeding our artists who are working tirelessly to make this the best EvilStick production yet! If we go above and beyond our fundraising goals, the leftover money will be going toward touring Gladys around Canada next year and building a nest egg for our company. 
Below is a breakdown on some of the costs associated with this production:
Posters $65 through Vistaprint
Handbills $75 through Vistaprint 
Rehearsal Space $50 non-refundable deposit for a key to our rehearsal space
Props $100 
Costume Design $300 as designed by Miranda Hughes
Set Design $400 as designed by Jillian Borrowman
Travel $1,385 to cover the flights from Toronto to Saskatoon for Miranda and Kelly as estimated through WestJet
Saskatoon Fringe Administration Fee $730
Artist Fees* $13,970 
We are proud to say that we are partnering with The Open Storefront Project, which has allowed us a free space to rehearse throughout the month of July. If you aren't familiar with them, please check them out! They provide amazing opportunities for artists in Saskatoon.
* Artist fees are estimated using CAEA ""G"" House wage guidelines at $628/week for our four actors throughout our 4 weeks of rehearsals and one week of shows. In addition, our director would be paid a sum of $1,409.50 using CAEA ""G"" House wage guidelines. This is very important to us because it means paying our artists a living wage. We are hoping to get as close to this goal as possible through our fundraising efforts and are happy to answer any questions you may have regarding the work of an actor, director, designer, etc. and how the Canadian Actor's Equity Association comes up with their numbers. 
What will you get out of it?
Other than that great feeling you get when supporting local art, you will be helping us produce our show - this won't only help to build a strong theatre community, but it will make you a valuable part of it. You will also be the first to receive perks and information on upcoming EvilStick events and shows.  Speaking of perks, we will be accepting contributions up until the end of our run at the 2017 YXE Fringe, and boy do we have some cool things up for grabs:

EvilStick/Gladys buttons

Signed Gladys posters
EvilStick T-shirts (yes, they will be tie dyed)
Tickets to our show
A portrait painted of your beautiful mug by one of EvilStick's founding members
Shout outs at our show and on social media
Producer status
A private show (and get this) anywhere you want
Our undying love and support <3

Why should you support this show?
EvilStick Productions is proudly in its third season, which means we have a solid past together where we have written, directed, and acted in successful shows. This year, we are stepping up our game, and with a fully formed script written by Kelly McTaggart, music by Miranda Hughes, and the wonderful Jillian Borrowman directing us, we are set up for our best year ever. Having already workshopped this script with the Saskatoon and Regina theatre communities, we have had successful feedback and are now ready and excited to bring this show to life at the 2017 Saskatoon Fringe. We have our show, we have a strong bond as a group of hard-working individuals, and we have a fully-formed vision. All we need is your contribution!
But *gasp* what about the risks!?
With any art venture, there are bound to be risks! We have faced many of them over the last two years, and are well on our way to overcoming a few that have already been thrown at us this year. With that being said, we have a fully-formed show, a strong vision, and we have our spot at the Saskatoon Fringe. There is nothing stopping us from putting up an amazing show, but what will bring it to the next level is the community support needed to make it truly shine (paper bag costumes and cardboard instruments will not stop us from putting this show up, but we would appreciate some real clothes, thx).

Other Fundraising
We have already raised a bit of money with an amazing Karaoke Steak Night we held in May, we are actively seeking sponsorships and donations of any kind, and we will be holding a Lip Synch for Your Life battle at the end of July (follow us on social media for more information on our upcoming events)! We have a successful track record and want to keep the momentum going up until our show in August. We want you to know just how much it means to us to make this project our best yet.

<h3>Who are we and what are we doing?</h3>
<p>We are a group of actors based in Los Angeles currently producing the theatrical Production of  ""Italian American Reconciliation"", by John Patrick Shanley, to be performed in November 2018. Our production team is formed by the actors;  <strong>Cassandra Jones, David Pesce</strong> and <strong>Marilia Colturato.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the play about?</strong></p>
<p>""Italian American Reconciliation"" takes place in Little Italy in New York City. Huey Maximilian Bonfigliano was married to Janice, who is described as being an evil person - she even shot his dog while they were together. Huey feels like he's lost his ""manhood"" and the only way he could regain it would be by having Janice back. Aldo Scalicki, Huey's best friend, tries to convince him with no success, to forget about his plan with Janice and says he should start a new life with his lady friend Teresa, who is not happy at all when she hears about what Huey is up to. Aldo, against his will, agrees on going to Janice's house to help his friend and try to make things better between them, or...make things worse...</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for us to have a successful run, we need your support! Our team truly believes that no one involved should work for free. YES! - that includes actors, who usually are asked to work for free or in exchange of anything else that is not money. Being actors for so many years, and having had that kind of experience so many times, we think that attitude it absolutely unacceptable! Work is work and you have to be payed for it!   </p>
<p>Here we go! The funds will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,750 - Actors</li>
<li>$550 - Director</li>
<li>$550 - Stage Manager</li>
<li>$550 - Technician </li>
<li>$880 - License/Rights</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Theater isn't exactly something that is sought after in Los Angeles. When thinking of Los Angeles, you don't necessarily think of theater. It's going to take extra time and effort to promote and drive people to come out and see theater. Theater is the foundation to performing. Before film, there was live theater. It seems to be a dying art in Los Angeles. We are all actors that got our start in theater and have worked on stage as well as back stage. We know what goes into pulling a production together so every cent will go towards making this the best production possible. On top of it all, we are paying our actors as well as director, stage manager, and technicians. We believe that no one should work for free. This is a passion project, however, our passion doesn't always pay the bills.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We will be taking quite a bit of time off from our ""survival jobs"" to make this happen.  I don't know how an actor can be more dedicated to their craft than to try and produce a play in Los Angeles, right!?!?!? </p>

<p align=""center""><i><u>For a Legend lives only because it is told.</u></i></p>
<p>Anne Bonny was a real person—a Pyrate, a Lover, a Murderer, a Mother—as notoriously brutal as she was beautiful. The very history itself is a drama that I never could claim to have written.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Fearsome, wild, and free at last,</i> <i>Anne Bonny plays her Part</i></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>ABOUT THIS PLAY:</strong></h3>
<p>I was six years old when I first heard Anne Bonny’s story. Sitting on a porch, deep in the swamps of Charleston, South Carolina, my great uncle Deryl puffed his tobacco pipe and told me a most remarkable tale. One of Passion, of Courage, of Strength, of Honor—the Legend of my Ancestor. Though her Fate is unknown, this Legend survives. It ripples across the centuries, passed through generations like blood through family lines.</p>
<p>You see, my great uncle Deryl was an expert in local Charleston lore and genealogy. I grew up believing that we were related to this fearsome Pyrate Queen (which Deryl insisted until the day he died) and I became obsessed with the idea that Anne Bonny only survives if her story is told. I’ve spent the last decade studying dramaturgy and playwriting so that I would have the tools to do justice to this woman’s life. What resulted since is a swashbuckling epic pyrate adventure—written in rhyming verse, no less—with an equally epic musical score, written by the incomparable Steven Schmidt.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We feel it is our duty to help her Legend live, and we can only hope that you will join us in the Adventure.</p>
<h3><strong>ABOUT THIS PRODUCTION: WHAT WE NEED</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We have a story that deserves to be told,</p>
<p align=""center"">and we are finally ready to tell it.</p>
<p>I’ve spent the last six years doing dramaturgical research on this subject, and the last four developing the script. There have been two staged readings, one youth adaptation, and a radio play. Currently, there is a student adaptation being produced at the University of Southern Oregon. Through these various amateur iterations, we have concentrated solely on storytelling, and doing justice to this incredible Tale. Some of you may have even donated to previous incarnations of this project in the past; the incredibly informative staged readings that took this play from infancy to maturity and helped to shape what we have today; a play that is finally ready to be fully and professionally realized.</p>
<p>For the first time, we have the full force of a professional theatre company behind us, which gives us the legitimization we so desperately needed to take this project to the next level. We will be performing as part of the SheLA Summer Theatre Festival, the west coast arm of the SheNYC organization, which is devoted to producing theatrical works by women. You can find more information about this wonderful organization here: <a href=""https://www.shenycarts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.shenycarts.org/</a></p>
<p>Though we have their support in terms of marketing and performance venue, it is up to our production team to actually produce our play. That’s where you come in! If we were truly method actors, we would simply pillage the money we need for sets, costumes, musicians, and rehearsal spaces. But since we cannot, we have no choice but to do the 21<sup>st</sup> century equivalent of piracy: begging for money on the internet!!</p>
<p>This Festival is a chance to perform for a wide array of industry professionals, who—if they like what they see—have the potential to truly elevate this show. SO. For all of these reasons, we want our production the best that it could possibly be, and for that we need yer dubloons!</p>
<p>It would be difficult to exaggerate the talent of our creative team, and it is almost impossible to quickly convey the intricate and profound ideas they have for this production.  Suffice it to say, your donations would go towards realizing the artistic vision of our entire team, and would allow us to truly honor the spirit of this unbelievable Pyrate. </p>

OF ANNE BONNY:
So hear a grand Tale of the fearsome and bold;
For a Legend lives only because it is told.
Anne Bonny was a real person—a Pyrate, a Lover, a Murderer, a Mother—as notoriously brutal as she was beautiful. The very history itself is a drama that I never could claim to have written.
What precious shreds of her existence we have come from A General History of the Pyrates, a fantastically suspect historical text, penned in 1724 by Captain Charles Johnson, a suspected alias of the famed fiction novelist Daniel Defoe.  It seems a fitting twist that like Anne herself, her legend was born of a convoluted love affair, one between myth and reality. This liminal space is precisely where the play lives; in the shadow between Art and History, between what was and what could have been.
Fearsome, wild, and free at last, Anne Bonny plays her Part
in the eternal Drama of Fact and Myth; Her Story made Legend by Art.
Though an Age has ended, her Day has flown, her Fate is still disputed.
What became of her since, only this is known; She was never executed.

<p><strong><u>About <i>The Dream Factory</i></u></strong></p>
<p><i>The Dream Factory: The 60 Most Fascinating People </i>is the first immersive and interactive experience from the upcoming company, Silver Dream Projects. The show has been created through a collaborative devised process by students of the SUNY Purchase College Theatre &amp; Performance program. This project is made up of three major shows: <i>Femme Fatale, The Exploding Plastic Inevitable, </i>and <i>The 60 Most Fascinating People</i>.</p>
<p>            <i>Femme Fatale </i>just finished its premiere at <a href=""http://dixonplace.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Dixon Place</a>. Vulva, one of Drellas rising stars, put on a hell of a performance art piece which was preceded and followed by immersive and interactive pre and post shows featuring some of the other major Superstars including Taxine, the Duchess, Whips and IV, just to name a few. As does everything in the Drellas Factory, drama erupted when it was discovered that Gerard, Drellas right hand man, would be leaving the factory.</p>
<p>            <i>The Exploding Plastic Inevitable, </i>set for Fall, will feature one of the first major live performances of Sonic Daydream, a band with whom Drella has been working very closely for the last few months. This performance will also feature immersive and interactive elements that will continue to pursue the lengths to which the Superstars will go to earn their 15 minutes.</p>
<p>            <i>The 60 Most Fascinating People</i>, set for April 17<sup>th</sup> – April 20<sup>th</sup> 2019, will be the grand finale to the saga. It will be performed in the Purchase College Center for Media, Film, and Theater.  Drella will be throwing a huge party to announce and celebrate his newest set of Superstars, an astounding 60 of them. This final installment will push the Superstars to their breaking points as some will risk it all in order to be Drellas favorite.</p>

Instead of loads of rioting French revolutionaries the story follows two unhappy administrators and their workaholic boss.</p>
<p>The show takes some tunes that will be very familiar to any Les Mis fan and brings them into the modern day, and specifically, into the head office of Land of Laminates, where we find Claire, Beth, and Mr Williams, who are all just trying to get through the day.</p>
<p>Having produced a short preview run at the Etcetera Theatre in London in February we know this show has legs, and gets a really positive audience reaction, but we need help to raise the money to get us to the Fringe.</p>

Everybody has a job - whether it's the one they're in at the moment, or one from the past that they've tried to forget about - that they've hated. This show allows the audience to open up a dialogue about those experiences and really laugh at the quirks and idiosyncrasies of those workplaces, instead of allowing them to fester and become something they can't even bear to think about any more.</p>
<p>Of course, it does also simply make people laugh in the moment, and that is absolutely what we're going for too.</p>

Instead of loads of rioting French revolutionaries the story follows two unhappy administrators and their workaholic boss.
The show takes some tunes that will be very familiar to any Les Mis fan and brings them into the modern day, and specifically, into the head office of Land of Laminates, where we find Claire, Beth, and Mr Williams, who are all just trying to get through the day.
Having produced a short preview run at the Etcetera Theatre in London in February we know this show has legs, and gets a really positive audience reaction, but we need help to raise the money to get us to the Fringe.


What do we need & what do you get?
 What the costs look like:  Fringe registration: £393.60
Venue costs: £1100
Insurance: £182.50
Online marketing: £250
Print marketing: £250
Clothes (branded clothing for the team to wear while flyering): £250
Set: £70
Accommodation for five people for the duration of the festival: £3000
London previews: £170
Pre-Edinburgh rehearsal day: £115
Travel: £400
Contingency money: £820 (To cover Indiegogo's commission and any unexpected emergencies. If not used this will go towards compensating the cast and creative team for their time.)
 
Any funds raised over £7000 will be used to ensure that all cast and creatives involved in the show can be paid for taking a full month away from their day jobs.

<div>
<p>“Cockroaches” is an original translation and production of Bulgakov’s play “Flight”; his first draft, written before it was censored by the Soviet theatres and Stalin’s censorship committee; translated by Anastasiya Sosis for London audiences.</p>
<p>Set in a war-torn Russia at the beginning of the 20th century, this is a story of five refugees, fleeing the Soviet regime in hope of finding a better life only to become aliens in an indifferent country. It is a bittersweet tragedy introducing us to events long gone that are as relevant today as they were 100 years ago.</p>
<p>“Cockroaches” explores the modern day issue of the refugee crisis, showing how people are reduced to the very basic forms of themselves by the disdain of their homeland and the indifference of the rest of the world, truly becoming cockroaches.</p>
<p>Ukrainian-born director, Anastasiya Sosis, has first-hand experience of the ongoing civil war in her home country. She brings to the stage her personal angle and understanding of what it’s like to lose one’s home and have no certainty of the future.</p>
<p>She produced the short film “Seagull Boy”, about an old woman who befriends an autistic man believing himself to be a seagull. This film was broadcast on Georgian National Television in 2013 and won the best lead actor in a short film at the Madrid International Film Festival 2014.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Director's Statement</h3>
<p>Before the civil war in Ukraine I used to watch the news reports on other countries and feel… nothing. Pity maybe. It was images of women and children crying and news headlines along the lines of “Another bomb hit the city of-“. I did not understand their horror.</p>
<p>But in May 2014 I was in Donetsk, my hometown, watching people prepare for the inevitable war, watching the civilians, who had no say in what was to happen, try and deal with the anxiety that took over the city. And when the war started I listened to the news reports, our own country’s politicians throwing dirt at my friends and family, as if it was their personal fault that the war happened. I felt angry, sad, devastated. I watched my loved ones drown in the never ending days of waiting for the war to end, hopes of returning to our home dying with every new day of news reports. And I felt betrayed. By my own country, by the media of other countries. I felt betrayed by the world, totally indifferent to the unfairness and the death happening in my homeland.</p>
<p>When I read Bulgakov’s play “Flight” I was shocked at how perfectly it reflected all the chaos, the confusion, and ugliness of war, and how the war affects people, forced to flee their own country. I thought that this is the perfect text to demonstrate not the indifferent facts, but the personal experiences of people.</p>
<p>I want to use this play to share my feelings with the audience, to hopefully achieve a greater understanding of the experience of civil war and fleeing one’s country, and being an alien everywhere you go. All the characters in the play have different fates, and yet, they are all irreversibly marked by their shared journey, and no matter where they go, they only have each other in this world.</p>

<h3>Community &amp; Art</h3>
<p>Disappearing everywhere are the local community theatres, however in our small town the State Theatre has been the heart of the community for over a century.

<ul>
<li> A place for our seniors, families and youth to have a low cost, safe alternative to spend their time enjoying a movie or live performance </li>
<li>A local theatre group to introduce people of all ages about live theatre whether it be acting or enjoying a performance.  Where did you see / do your first live performance?  Let us be theirs.</li>
<li>A meeting place for friends and community to catch up and keep connected</li>
<li>Sharing music - it doesn't matter what genre but sharing it with the community and sharing our community with others who come in to see us.</li>

<h3>About the show</h3>
<p>Hi everyone, Anna here. I have been working on <strong>MYTHO? Lure of Wildness</strong> on and off for almost three years now. Starting the project with my incredible director, Caleb Hammond, it has grown and grown to include four other performers and a production team of ten! It is an ambitious production but already it is looking beautiful and I can't wait to share it with you. </p>
<p>We want to create something really special with this production, a jewel of sensations, a heightened world, a sensory experience of enhanced stimuli and vivid images.</p>
<p>Our weekend of performances in Boston will be he first time this version of<strong> MYTHO?</strong> will be in front of an audience and is an incredibly important part of this process.

<h3><strong>About us?</strong></h3>
<p>We are In The Quirks Theatre (ITQT), and are a London Based Physical Theatre Company in Twickenham. We are made up of 6 actors who have all studied Drama and Physical theatre at St Mary's University Twickenham. We all have a great passion in performing arts and an even bigger passion for story telling. We are always engaged and hungry to create something new and exciting on stage. We performed 'The Missing Girl Of Grigglewood' during our last term of University and since then have always dreamed in taking the production further, even to Edinburgh Fringe.</p>
<p>Our Campaign means a lot to us as we have a great ambition in performing this witty yet dark comedy to as much audience possible and also show to our audiences how much fun it can be to let loose on stage and invite them in on the fun. We are touring this show; starting at Salisbury, Twickenham, Wandsworth Town, Kingston and Edinburgh! As a new and young theatre company, we are learning that starting out without  support and funding is difficult. So we are in search of finding any support possible to help us accomplish our ambition in touring this show around England this Year. We appreciate every single penny as it enables us to cover costs of venue hire, travel and equipment used for the show as we have provided this out of our own pockets so far. To get this show on the road will be a dream come true and we can't do it without your support.</p>
<h3>What do you get out of it?</h3>

<p>Thank you. </p>
</div></div>","About us?
We are In The Quirks Theatre (ITQT), and are a London Based Physical Theatre Company in Twickenham. We are made up of 6 actors who have all studied Drama and Physical theatre at St Mary's University Twickenham. We all have a great passion in performing arts and an even bigger passion for story telling. We are always engaged and hungry to create something new and exciting on stage. We performed 'The Missing Girl Of Grigglewood' during our last term of University and since then have always dreamed in taking the production further, even to Edinburgh Fringe.
Our Campaign means a lot to us as we have a great ambition in performing this witty yet dark comedy to as much audience possible and also show to our audiences how much fun it can be to let loose on stage and invite them in on the fun. We are touring this show; starting at Salisbury, Twickenham, Wandsworth Town, Kingston and Edinburgh! As a new and young theatre company, we are learning that starting out without  support and funding is difficult. So we are in search of finding any support possible to help us accomplish our ambition in touring this show around England this Year. We appreciate every single penny as it enables us to cover costs of venue hire, travel and equipment used for the show as we have provided this out of our own pockets so far. To get this show on the road will be a dream come true and we can't do it without your support.
What do you get out of it?

<p>WHAT IS THIS CAMPAIGN AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? This campaign is to raise funds for our dancers and the artistic director to travel to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2017. We will be SELF-PRODUCING A SHOW (please see WHY we are having this change below) in August of **2017**. Self-producing a show is a HUGE task, but one we know we can do, especially with Mindi's extensive experience of producing shows for the past 16 years!</p>
<p>This is important to us due to the magnitude of returning to Edinburgh and the Edinburgh Fringe! Mindi, our artistic director, was the only one who could travel and perform in 2013. This opportunity allows our company members to attend, as well as Mindi, and allows us to perform in the LARGEST FRINGE FESTIVAL in the WORLD! We will also gain major International exposure as an entire dance company! We will be bringing our New Orleans premiere dances ""The Pleasure &amp; The Pain"" AND re-setting ""The Starving Faithful""  which originally premiered in Lafayette, LA, with our southern company, Oiseau Noir Danse.</p>
<p>The magnitude of what your contribution would help us achieve is enormous: You would allow our dancers to travel and perform internationally, which has never happened professionally for most them yet. This opportunity would send the Blackbirds FLYING higher than we've ever flown, and we are trying to spread our general message across the world: The investigation of social justice issues, cultural struggles via a socio-economic lens while looking at human relationships and the emotions that ensure make us ask the ultimate question of WHY? </p>

<h2>Dear

incredibly excited to announce that Brookes Stage Company is FINALLY coming out
of hibernation and kicking off our next season with ""Definitions: A Play
on Love""! This fall, we teamed with alumni from the past four graduating
classes of Circle in the Square Theatre School to piece together six One Act
Plays for an awesome night of theatre!</p>
<blockquote>What makes
our show so special?</blockquote>
<p>Each play has
been selected because it highlights a specific genre of theatre unlike any
other. The commonality between these six plays is the theme of love.
Join us as we explore how the energy of love
abstracts into new stories and definitions through different styles of theatre,
whether it is satire, farce, or drama!</p>
<blockquote>What We Need
&amp; What You Get</blockquote>
<p>You may have
already noticed that we have incorporated all kinds of special perks that are
attached to the generous donations to show our gratitude. We have perks that
range from a special THANK YOU in our program, to an invitation to an
appreciation dinner with the cast and crew!</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Our

<p>Help us create this important film!</p>
<p></p>
<h3><i>COMANCHE: Accessing the Legacy of Coast Guardsman Charles W. David Jr.</i></h3>
<h3>We need to raise $2500!</h3>
<p><b>Your help is important. Please contribute to the development of a live performance work and short film that sheds light on the ultimate contribution made by military serviceman Charles W David Jr.<br/></b></p>
<p><i>Comanche: Accessing the Legacy of
Coast Guardsman Charles W. David Jr. </i>is
a live dance work that includes choreography by Duane Cyrus and music composed
by Richard Bennett as well as film. It documents and explores the history of Coast Guardsman
Charles W. David Jr. It is a dynamic multimedia work performed by an ensemble
of dancers who carry the audience through the journey, pride, and self
sacrifice often made by military servicemen. The title, <i>Comanche</i> is the name of the Coast Guard Cutter that David served on during WW II and where he demonstrated unprecedented heroism during a rescue mission to pluck
survivors from the torpedoed ship, <i>Dorchester</i>.
David later died from exposure due to repeatedly plunging into the North
Atlantic to rescue survivors.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>We need to raise $2500!</h3>
<div>There are considerable costs associated with this project. Your contribution will help make the completion of this work possible. The film will be made available online and will also be part of the live performance. Duane Cyrus (director and choreographer) and a range of artists from other disciplines will work on this project throughout the summer and fall of 2016.<br/>
</div>
<div>UPDATES: <br/>We attended the <b>Experimental Film Virginia</b> festival June 26-July 10 in Cape Charles, VA. We worked there to explore the idea of ""Rescue"" on  film. While this is not the final product. It's an example of one way to explore the idea. Here's a link to the result of that exploration: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/174346134"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/174346134</a><br/><br/>Duane Cyrus attended the <b>Swampfest </b>summer dance intensive and shared the story of Charles W. David Jr. with the students. They also explored the idea of ""Rescue""––this time through choreography and improvisation for a live dance. Examples of these explorations can be found on this site or on Vimeo: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/174949854"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/174949854</a><br/>
</div>
<div>Here's a list of what you will receive for the following suggested contributions:</div>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>Historic Significance</b></p>
<p>Charles W. David
Jr. is a WWII hero who is described as “<i>Stewards-Mate
First Class Charles Walter David, Jr., an African American Coast Guardsman who
served on board CGC Comanche on
North Atlantic convoy duty during World War II…On the night of 3 February 1943
the U.S. Army transport USS Dorchester
was torpedoed by a German U-boat off the coast of Greenland.  When the Comanche came to the aid of the
survivors of Dorchester in the
frigid waters, David was one of the few Comanche
crewmen who volunteered to dive overboard to help rescue those in need… David
died a few days later from pneumonia contracted during his heroic efforts to
save the stricken survivors of the Dorchester. 
He was posthumously awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his bravery.</i>”
(<a href=""http://www.uscg.mil/history/people/Charles_David.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.uscg.mil/history/people/Charles_David.asp</a>)</p>
<p>Charles David Jr. is the uncle of Duane
Cyrus who has known of Charles W. David since childhood but only began exploring his history in depth in 2013 when a fast
response Coast Guard Cutter was commissioned in his honor in Key West, FL.
Cyrus attended the commissioning ceremony and has been motivated to use his
expertise as an artist and scholar to honor the military contributions of his
uncle. This project also has significance on a number of scholarly, creative,
and academic levels. First, the work developed will use an interdisciplinary
approach to the performing arts to shed light on contributions made by African
Americans through military service. </p>
<p>The outcomes in music, dance and film will
serve our nation by highlighting important contribution made by servicemen that
may have gone unnoticed. Audiences will also benefit from the exposure to arts
programming and historical research while engaging creative artists.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We have gathered attention and some support for this project. Most of the support is in terms of the talent available and the space to rehearse. We need funds to complete the film and pay performers for rehearsal. The other challenges are in finding more avenues of exposure for the work (performances, lectures, etc.,) and ensuring that the outcome is engaging and impactful. </p>

COMANCHE: Accessing the Legacy of Coast Guardsman Charles W. David Jr.
We need to raise $2500!
Your help is important. Please contribute to the development of a live performance work and short film that sheds light on the ultimate contribution made by military serviceman Charles W David Jr.
Comanche: Accessing the Legacy of
Coast Guardsman Charles W. David Jr. is
a live dance work that includes choreography by Duane Cyrus and music composed
by Richard Bennett as well as film. It documents and explores the history of Coast Guardsman
Charles W. David Jr. It is a dynamic multimedia work performed by an ensemble
of dancers who carry the audience through the journey, pride, and self
sacrifice often made by military servicemen. The title, Comanche is the name of the Coast Guard Cutter that David served on during WW II and where he demonstrated unprecedented heroism during a rescue mission to pluck
survivors from the torpedoed ship, Dorchester.
David later died from exposure due to repeatedly plunging into the North
Atlantic to rescue survivors.
   We need to raise $2500!
There are considerable costs associated with this project. Your contribution will help make the completion of this work possible. The film will be made available online and will also be part of the live performance. Duane Cyrus (director and choreographer) and a range of artists from other disciplines will work on this project throughout the summer and fall of 2016.

UPDATES: We attended the Experimental Film Virginia festival June 26-July 10 in Cape Charles, VA. We worked there to explore the idea of ""Rescue"" on  film. While this is not the final product. It's an example of one way to explore the idea. Here's a link to the result of that exploration: https://vimeo.com/174346134Duane Cyrus attended the Swampfest summer dance intensive and shared the story of Charles W. David Jr. with the students. They also explored the idea of ""Rescue""––this time through choreography and improvisation for a live dance. Examples of these explorations can be found on this site or on Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/174949854

The Impact 
Historic Significance
Charles W. David
Jr. is a WWII hero who is described as “Stewards-Mate
First Class Charles Walter David, Jr., an African American Coast Guardsman who
served on board CGC Comanche on
North Atlantic convoy duty during World War II…On the night of 3 February 1943
the U.S. Army transport USS Dorchester
was torpedoed by a German U-boat off the coast of Greenland.  When the Comanche came to the aid of the
survivors of Dorchester in the
frigid waters, David was one of the few Comanche
crewmen who volunteered to dive overboard to help rescue those in need… David
died a few days later from pneumonia contracted during his heroic efforts to
save the stricken survivors of the Dorchester. 
He was posthumously awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his bravery.”
(http://www.uscg.mil/history/people/Charles_David.asp)
Charles David Jr. is the uncle of Duane
Cyrus who has known of Charles W. David since childhood but only began exploring his history in depth in 2013 when a fast
response Coast Guard Cutter was commissioned in his honor in Key West, FL.
Cyrus attended the commissioning ceremony and has been motivated to use his
expertise as an artist and scholar to honor the military contributions of his
uncle. This project also has significance on a number of scholarly, creative,
and academic levels. First, the work developed will use an interdisciplinary
approach to the performing arts to shed light on contributions made by African
Americans through military service. 
The outcomes in music, dance and film will
serve our nation by highlighting important contribution made by servicemen that
may have gone unnoticed. Audiences will also benefit from the exposure to arts
programming and historical research while engaging creative artists.   Risks & Challenges We have gathered attention and some support for this project. Most of the support is in terms of the talent available and the space to rehearse. We need funds to complete the film and pay performers for rehearsal. The other challenges are in finding more avenues of exposure for the work (performances, lectures, etc.,) and ensuring that the outcome is engaging and impactful.

We are building community  through art education and cultural experiences like the ‘LADIES BATTLE!', an annual dance battle featuring the world's best of the best female dance competitors. 
Dance is a powerful ally for developing many of the attributes of a growing child. Dance helps children mature physically, emotionally, socially, and cognitively. The physical benefits of dance are widely accepted, but the emotional, social and cognitive attributes have only recently begun to be appreciated. 
Put $5 on Art!

The value and positive impact of arts study on children and adolescents is often self-evident to artists, musicians, and arts educators. Yet, the arts community is frequently called upon to justify the expenses of arts education by providing evidence that engaging in arts eduction and arts experiences make a meaningful, positive difference in the lives of students. 
Students of music and dance were significantly less likely than non-arts students to be engaged in fewer delinquent behaviors during adolescence, while visual arts students are significantly more likely to be engaged in delinquent behaviors.(*data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health; “Add Health”)



Exactly Where does the money go?
Break'in  it down for folks (pun intended):  
Artist Meals, Travel & Lodging: $3000
Artist Fees: $1500  This won't cover our entire budget but the $4900+ helps substantially! 

The remaining balance of our $25,000 annual event budget is generated via ticket sales, merchandise sales... and the love and support of me, my friends & family.

<p>Feeling blue, out of blue... ""Wo looks outside dreams, who looks inside awakes"" CG Jung</p>
<p>""It is essential to let ourselves dream and to understand our deepest dreams, as we all carry the bottomless potential to create our own reality by dreaming... Let's dream and wake up together""</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping us create this theatrical piece you will contribute to the beauty of innovative and feminine driven creation. We create a safe space in which we dive into the unknown and still know exactly what we want to achieve: Bring MAGIC back into the world.</p>
<p>The show will invite men and women to experience our visions and stories, and get a sense of the feminine way of dreaming. Is there a feminine way of dreaming? We will find out.</p>
<p>The theatre is a sacred space in which all miracles can happen, the miracles we are all looking for in our realities often happen in our dreams. BLAUHAUCH<strong> </strong>will be a piece in which we welcome YOU and all those who join us to experience it, to completely relax and fly back to an inner state of childlike fantasy in which anything can happen really. Because dream was there before the thought. So let's dream first and think after. Or stop thinking for a while.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>BLAUHAUCH // Le Songe Bleu is an innovative theatre piece based on the dramaturgy of the dream. We will explore the night dream, the day dream and the lucid dream, aiming to open new doors for the theatre to dive into other realms with us.</p>
<p>We dream the play into being. We are working as a multidisciplinary group of female actresses, storytellers, dancers, filmmakers and circus performers. Based in Berlin and in different places in France, we aim to meet in both countries to dream and create a powerful international connection.</p>
<p>During the residency in November 2017 we will write the dream script for the show BLAUHAUCH that we will perform on different theatres in Europe, starting with the stages in Berlin, and also perform in female prisons, psychiatric hospitals and houses of prostitution. As we are a group of thirteen women, we aim to explore the themes of feminine sexuality in dreams, and really get a sense of the common symbols that keep on recurring in all our dreams. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Feeling blue, out of blue... ""Wo looks outside dreams, who looks inside awakes"" CG Jung
""It is essential to let ourselves dream and to understand our deepest dreams, as we all carry the bottomless potential to create our own reality by dreaming... Let's dream and wake up together""
The Impact
By helping us create this theatrical piece you will contribute to the beauty of innovative and feminine driven creation. We create a safe space in which we dive into the unknown and still know exactly what we want to achieve: Bring MAGIC back into the world.
The show will invite men and women to experience our visions and stories, and get a sense of the feminine way of dreaming. Is there a feminine way of dreaming? We will find out.
The theatre is a sacred space in which all miracles can happen, the miracles we are all looking for in our realities often happen in our dreams. BLAUHAUCH will be a piece in which we welcome YOU and all those who join us to experience it, to completely relax and fly back to an inner state of childlike fantasy in which anything can happen really. Because dream was there before the thought. So let's dream first and think after. Or stop thinking for a while.
Short Summary
BLAUHAUCH // Le Songe Bleu is an innovative theatre piece based on the dramaturgy of the dream. We will explore the night dream, the day dream and the lucid dream, aiming to open new doors for the theatre to dive into other realms with us.
We dream the play into being. We are working as a multidisciplinary group of female actresses, storytellers, dancers, filmmakers and circus performers. Based in Berlin and in different places in France, we aim to meet in both countries to dream and create a powerful international connection.
During the residency in November 2017 we will write the dream script for the show BLAUHAUCH that we will perform on different theatres in Europe, starting with the stages in Berlin, and also perform in female prisons, psychiatric hospitals and houses of prostitution. As we are a group of thirteen women, we aim to explore the themes of feminine sexuality in dreams, and really get a sense of the common symbols that keep on recurring in all our dreams. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
We will need a total of 20.000 Euros for us to be able to all travel to an unusual place (maybe a castle or a church or a Yurt in France, a farm in Spain or a church in Romania) and develop the script together.
We will need the money for travel costs, food, accommodation and dream specialists (Hypnosis Masters, Dream Therapists) to assist us in the process of creating BLAUHAUCH. We want to be able to leave Berlin and connect to new energies in order to have a clear mind and let the dreams visit us freely. During this time we will create another video and a short documentary about our dream circles and intuitive writing that we would love to share with you.

Other contribution perks for the Day-Dreamers and Night-Dreamers are recorded audio books in which we will tell some of the chosen dreams and record a guided dream meditation together.
 
Challenges
BLAUHAUCH has not been done yet, and we trust in the process, as we are all coming from very different backgrounds, and we bring different qualities.
Some of us will take care of the movement choreographies, others of the written words, others of the acting part. As a team of very different and yet so similar women, we are going to share the tasks and gather our very unique gifts to overcome obstacles during the process.

Other Ways You Can Help
Please let us know about unusual spaces, residencies, or rehearsal rooms in which we could dream, and as we speak 7 languages in the group, we are always very happy to co-produce with other countries.
We are also thankful for every piece of blue material, fabric, paint etc... that you might not need anymore, to start creating the visuals of the piece.

<h3>What We've Done So Far!</h3>
<p>We want an overall production budget of $10,000 for our spring show. We are looking to raise $5,500 in order to reach that budget and have been fundraising since late summer to get there! As you can see, we're so close, but we need a little more to hit that magic number.</p>
<p><u><strong>August</strong></u></p>

<p><u><strong>September</strong></u></p>
<p>We opened Reboot U, an educational series of classes aimed at helping artists brush up on their skills or to try something entirely new! We offered four classes that included monologue work, song selection, a musical theatre dance class, and culminating in a special audition panel where local working directors and music directors volunteered their time to critique students' audition work. It was tremendously successful outreach into our community and got a lot of positive feedback. We'll definitely be doing this again!</p>

<p><i>The Eleventh Hour!</i> <i> </i>was first developed as a fifteen minute musical as part of <a href=""http://www.colab-arts.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">coLAB Arts</a>' first annual 48 Hour Musicals in 2015 in New Brunswick, NJ. <i>TEH!  </i>struck a chord with audiences for its humor, musical hooks, and familiar (yet strange!) cast of characters. coLAB Arts' commissioned the creative team to take the original story and turn it into a full length musical which was workshopped and performed in June and December of 2016. In January 2018, <i>TEH! </i>will be making it's NYC debut as part of <a href=""http://www.newyorktheaterfestival.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NY Winterfest</a>, where we will be presenting three performances at the Hudson Guild Theatre before moving into an open-ended New York run!</p>
<p><i>The Eleventh Hour! </i>celebrates the punks and misfits of the New Brunswick, NJ basement music scene.

<h3>WHAT IT GETS US</h3>
<p><strong>We're looking to raise $10,000 to help us cover all of our expenses for our first NYC production! </strong>And to thank you, we'll be sending you cool merch, cast recordings, and original artwork inspired by the production ... maybe even a private performance???!!!</p>
<p>A donation between $1 and $15 dollars will help us buy all of the props that we need for The Eleventh Hour! Our intent is to use mostly recycled objects and props for the production (it is the Apocalypse after all!) but we anticipate needing at least 10 strings of Christmas lights in order to light the space. We are also in need of several chairs and other set dressing. Every single dollar helps!</p>
<p>$20 will cover the cost of renting our rehearsal space for one Saturday rehearsal. We rehearse every single week to bring this show to the stage for you, and we need a place to do it!  </p>
<p>$25 covers the cost of one ticket. Your contribution allows us to bring industry professionals and producers in to see the show and potentially invest in its future!</p>
<p>$50 buckaroonis will cover the cost of renting one mic pack for the show to make sure that everyone in the audience can hear our actors over the sounds of the #RockApocalypse. In total, we will be renting 8 mic packs.</p>
<p>One Benjamin Franklin will cover one of our musician’s travel for the entire rehearsal process!  We currently have three musicians working on The Eleventh Hour! in order to bring our writer and composer Dave Seamon’s vision to life. Making sure they’re at rehearsal gives the actors a true sense of what their performance will be like and lets them feel out how they can best deliver the story to our adoring fans.</p>
<p>A donation of $250 will cover our rehearsal supply expenses for the production! We rehearse every single week in order to bring The Eleventh Hour to life.</p>
<p>$500 -  Winterfest does not advertise for the shows that perform in the festival, so it’s up to us to spread the word about how awesome our show is--and we can’t do that without your help! $500 will cover our entire marketing and advertising costs for this run and allow us to bring this show to people from all over the Tri-State Area.</p>
<p>$1,000 - If we are able to reach our fundraising goals, ONE THOOOOOOUSAND DOLLARS will cover the cost of getting you, our supporters and fans, a CAST RECORDING of The Eleventh Hour! The cast recording will feature all of the songs you know and love</p>
<p>$2,000 - Covers all of the transportation costs for our New Jersey cast, musicians, and creative team!</p>
<p>$50,000 GETS US OFF THIS ROCK! Just kidding, but it WILL cover the ENTIRE cost of this production, plus enough for us to extend our run and bring the Rock Apocalypse to the rest of NYC!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Director, Choreographer Krista Leigh Pasini believes we are all dancers, performing a contemplative choreography for each other each day – through movement, pattern, and gesture. “These often unconscious patterns reveal a subtext built within our cellular memory. Memories held in the body. All this feeds into a physical language that reveal more about ourselves than often our words might. It’s as though we each have an unspoken language lending to a richer subtext of our psyche. Within these patterns, our subconscious unfolds a tenuous dance of our deepest thoughts and family stories. And. If we listen we will hear it, if we observe – we will witness it. The stories of each life held within our bodies; stories held closely within each person as we shapeshift through the day, performing happiness for one another. By listening, observing, and honoring the rich subtext of our body’s narrative we can learn so much from one another; we can find empathy, love, and reflection.” ~ Krista Pasini</p>
<p><i>All Together Now</i> first premiered as a one act submission for Sacrifice Cliff Theatre’s New Works Festival in 2015. Pasini collaborated with sound artist Matt Taggart on the drifting gaps in Montana families as sons and daughters pick up new occupations and leave the farms, ranches, and towns they were raised in. Without dialog the piece depicts a family at dinner communicating through action and gesture. A secondary narrative evolved, how a family bonds and fractures within grief. Taking the original work and expanding upon the family dynamics,<i> All Together Now</i> premiered as a 90 minute one act in April 2016, as part of Sacrifice Cliff Theatre’s season. It received overwhelming praise and an additional weekend was added. Through the development process, Pasini worked collaboratively with the cast to create unique and nuanced characters in the throes of some of their darkest hours.</p>
<p><i>“I still can’t quite articulate the level to which I was touched.

<h3>The Big 'Ask' </h3>
<p>Our full budget is $8000.00. This covers the full project and we'd like to make that goal through crowdfunding, individual donors, and organizational sponsors. </p>
<p><strong>Artist Fee</strong>: A lot of miles separate the communities of Montana and prepping a project of this size and travelling to Helena Montana (4 hours) away requires a lot of support. It's important that the cast and crew are compensated for their time and their craft. They'll be dedicating large spans of time to rehearsals in their home community and another week rehearsing and performing in Helena. </p>
<p><strong>Theater Rental + Technical Staff</strong>: Carroll College's new FLEX Black Box is a top of the line theater space we'll be living in for nearly a week. This time will include cross training with faculty as well technical rehearsals with the cast and crew</p>
<p><strong>Promotion</strong>: We are fortunate to have support from community artists to help us get the word out about this important project. Furnace Filmworks will produce a film trailer and Font &amp; Figure provided poster and print material. Artists often barter, but it's important to support those that can lend their artistry to help this project grow. In return they deserve monetary compensation so they too can grow.</p>
<p><strong>Rehearsal Space</strong>: It's important that rehearsals take place in the same location the project was first performed in and we'd like to secure a considerable amount of time in May to be in the space and work through the show methodically. The owners of 2905 were and are supportive of this project and we want to recognize their efforts to create a performance space that made a home for All Together Now. </p>
<p><strong>Fiscal Sponsor</strong>: All contributions towards this project will go through Montana Arts, a 501c-3. Having the support and services of Montana Arts will allow sponsors and donors assurance that their investment in this project is tax deductible and has credible oversight from a state wide organization. A small fee applies to this service and we're grateful to have the Montana Arts' support.</p>

<h3>Stretching the Definition of Community</h3>
<p>Why Helena? A Montana artist based out of Billings Montana, Krista Leigh Pasini’s early inspiration came from training and performing under Sallyann Mulcahy, a former artist in residence at Carroll College. Mulcahy blended performative storytelling in ways that captivated Pasini. Re-connecting with Carroll College and Helena, a community that helped shape Pasini’s craft as a performative artist, is a ‘homecoming’ of sorts.</p>
<p>Montana is separated by vast interstates and highways, in any direction, communities are distanced by an hour or more drive. Why not foster collaboration through performative exchange? Independent artists benefit from multidisciplinary engagement, collaborative opportunities, and a wider net of peer support. Creating a richer embedment among artists in this unique part of the Northwest.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Risk of Trying</h3>
<p>Bringing an original and important project like <i>All Together Now</i> to another community requires trust in the work, but it also requires diligence. The risk of raising the needed funds places constraints on how independent artists produce and share new work in and around the state.  The risks are many, but so are the risks of not trying.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Support isn't always financial and in many instances having someone share our work and our story is just as vital. We encourage you to like, share, and comment on this campaign and project as it progresses. The cast and crew will greatly appreciate any kind words and support you can share. </p>
<p>We also would like to document this project, film &amp; photography. If you, or someone you know, is able to carve out some time we'd love to hear from you.</p>

<h3>Hey everybody! Here’s a little story for you!</h3>
<p>One summer day in Juneau, Alaska, high school seniors, Aaron Badilla, James Raymond Rosales, Phil Derbesy, Franz Felkl, many of their friends, and Christopher the Cat, got together in Aaron’s small bedroom studio and recorded the song “I Am The Fling”. </p>
<p>They couldn’t have known it at the time, but they had just recorded the first of many songs that would be written and recorded that summer. The songs never made it into the Top 40, or really even made it out of Juneau, but, for the people who wrote them, they became treasured musical memories and formed the basis of close, enduring friendships.</p>
<p>Ten years later, motivated by the lasting impact of the music, the relationships, and life in Alaska, Aaron Badilla would sit down and write <i>The Fling LP,</i> a musical play centered around the songs that were written during that pivotal summer and the love, loss, and grumpy old cat that inspired them.</p>
<p>After bringing on co-writer Molly Shimko and submitting the play to a couple of theaters and festivals, The Fling LP was chosen to be part of the New York Theater Festival Summerfest 2019! </p>
<p><strong>This campaign will help us bring to life this story of friendship, flings, and the power of music!</strong></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>All the money raised here goes straight to making every part of The Fling LP happen! </p>
<p>Parts of the production that the campaign will be funding:</p>
<p><strong>Cast: </strong>It’s going to take a team to bring this production together! A portion of our funding will go to paying our talented actor-musicians; we believe very strongly in supporting our artists and paying them for their hard work! </p>
<p><strong>Crew: </strong>The same goes for our designers and ops! They are going to play an integral role in making the music come to life and bringing the Northern Lights to mid-town Manhattan! And, of course, nothing comes together without a brilliant stage management team! </p>
<p><strong>Nitty Gritties:</strong> There is a lot that goes into producing a show and our funds will also go towards just such necessities as renting rehearsal space, marketing materials, programs, sound/lighting equipment, and more! </p>
<p><strong>Christopher Puppet: </strong>The band is not complete without its resident cat and part of this dough will be going towards creating a fantastic puppet that does the leading cat himself justice! </p>
<p><strong>And we’ve got perks! </strong>We’ve got all the Fling related goodies that your heart could desire at our very own digital “merch table in the back”! Every donation gets you some sweet Fling gifts, special Christopher inspired swag, and ways to show our everlasting gratitude! </p>

<h3>Menomonee Falls is in need of a live music venue </h3>

<h3>From Ryan O'Connor </h3>
<p>""Take your broken heart, make it into art."" - Carrie Fisher </p>
<p>Thank you for visiting our IndieGoGo page! You've already done more than most people will and I am grateful to have your attention! </p>
<p>In 2015, I was suddenly presented with a slew of life circumstances. Extreme weight loss, sobriety and a divorce. I proceeded to make one of the most bizarre and life-changing decisions of my life. I left my comfortable Los Angeles liberal show biz bubble to go work as a Field Organizer for the Hillary Clinton Presidential campaign in Pontiac, Michigan. What happened next was not only a major milestone in American politics and history, but an experience that fundamentally changed my perception of strength and adaptability. In myself, yes, but more importantly in the stories I got from, and relationships I built with, the women I met working on and volunteering for this historic and world-altering campaign. </p>
<p>In late 2017, I presented a version of this story with the same title, taken form Elizabeth Gilbert's epic divorce novel, ""Eat, Pray, Love,"" as a one night cabaret performance at LA's Rockwell Table &amp; Stage, featuring stories from this bizarre year in my life and songs featuring myself and special guests, portraying different characters in song only. It was a really special night and what emerged was a story that I was told, and agreed, was worth telling more of.</p>
<p>I took this idea to the generous people at Celebration Theatre in Hollywood, and was given the opportunity to put up another version for 4 performances on their off schedule nights (Sundays and Mondays) and pulled together my resources (financially and, more importantly, favors) and in what felt like a record breaking amount of time, with the help of Tal Fox, incredible direction by Tony Award Winner Marissa Jaret Winokur, vigilant musical direction by Andy Arena, epic arrangements by Emily Rosenfield and the generous time and talent of actors Katherine Tokarz, Lindsay Heather Pearce, Amber Liekhus and Alex Nee, we somehow put up a show in 6 rehearsals that resonated with audiences beyond my wildest dreams and expectations, including winning multiple StageSceneLA awards for excellence in LA theatre! </p>
<p>At the end of those 4 performances, I knew in my gut that something was here that needed to be cultivated and told even further. The characters had come to life and the story was taking hold, but it still needed to grow before it saw more audiences. It was time to turn this ""play with music"" into an autobigraphical musical. </p>
<p>Since then, I've gotten to work. Fleshing out the story, characters and songs and figuring out the intention of the piece. To tell my own story and get lots of attention for it? Sure. I'm not gonna argue there. But also.....to use my story to empower people to walk through fear and shame and regret and be of service and listen and heal and grown and then.....to get active...to volunteer.....and vote. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It starts with Los Angeles....</p>
<p>The goal is to set 'Vote, Pray, Love"" up for success as much as humanly possible by giving it every opportunity to have a successful Los Angeles run, for a minimum of 3 weekends at a prominent Los Angeles venue, with sets, costumes, paid actors, paid musicians, marketing, publicity, musical arrangements, choreography, sound design, lighting design and that crucial piece of LA theatre success........PARKING! </p>
<ul>
<li>I can break it down for you, if you want, but here's the major fact. We need $20,000. This is the minimum it will take to make any waves in the complicated Los Angeles theatre scene and set this production up for success and future audiences. </li>
<li>Every single cent of this campaign will go to the funding of this production, which will in turn set this production up for possible (POSSIBLE) profit that will lead to further productions of the show in other cities, in front of new audiences and possibly even more technologically advanced options that can get the piece in front of even wider audiences.....if you know what we mean. </li>
<li>Perks! We've all been around the crowdfunding game for a while now. I'm not gonna waste your time or anyone's money and resources with t-shirts and refridgeator magnets you don't care about. Our perks are specifically targeted to help you feel a part of the process. From the basic but essentials (program thank you's, advanced purchase of tickets you know I'm gonna make you buy anyway, opening night receptions, meet and greets, special social media shout outs) to  the more unique (rehearsal vists, special in home concerts -hey big spenders-and actual participation in the show) we will do everything on our end to make you feel a part of this show which is, at it's core, about community. </li>
<li>The main perk? Absolute heartfelt and undying gratitude. From the deepest, purest part of my heart. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a tricky time in history to ask for money for art. I know that. </p>
<p>It is my earnest belief that ""Vote, Pray, Love"" has the ability to embolden, empower and educate people to want to not only walk through their own life trials and tribulations, but do it while helping others to help themselves and help the world. It is also my sincere hope that by bringing this show to as broad an audience as possible, we can inspire more people to get active, volunteer and vote in the crucial elections and movements facing our country today and for the future.</p>
<p>By funding this specific Los Angeles production of ""Vote, Pray, Love"" you will be helping secure the foundation to tell this story to more and more audiences over the next two years as we head in to our next Presidential election.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Theatre is a tough medium, especially these days and especially in Los Angeles. People can watch anything at home, that's what I usually do, But, there is nothing like live theatre to motivate and inspire audiences. Can I guarantee audiences are going to come out and take to this show? No. I can't. That's the magic of theatre. It might fail. It might fail big time.</p>
<p>Something I learned while working for the Hillary campaign is how important community truly is. Not just idealistically, but how we are all just as strong as the weakest member of our community. And it is the responisbility of all of us to use the gifts, skills, strengths and resources we have to lift each other up so we can all thrive and succeed. </p>
<p>I believe that ""Vote, Pray, Love"" is a direct product of my purpose and duty to the world we currently live in and I hope that as my community, you will help me fulfill that purpose to the best of my ability.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word. Tweet, Insta, Facebook, Snapchat, Grindr....I don't care! Just tell people! </li>
<li>IndieGoGo has some great sharing tools, so use those or come up with your own! </li>
<li>See something that you might be able to help with that isn't a fincanical contribution? Tell us! We need all the help we can get and aren't afraid of being creative! </li>
</ul>
</div><p>So, that's my pitch. I look forward to having you on this journey with me. I promise to make you proud. </p></div>","From Ryan O'Connor

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are <a href=""http://www.terrafeminacollective.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Terra Femina Collective</a>, a group of Kansas City based theatre artists that, in June 2019, are doing something that has never happened in Kansas City: producing not just one, but two new plays, written by women, directed by women, in rep. Together these plays, MERELY PLAYERS by Katherine Gwynn and VIPER by Lindsay Adams, are re-framing current narratives around sexual assault and survivorship by engaging our audience in the kind of radical empathy that only theatre can inspire.</p>
<p>We've been working on this for nearly a year, planning, fundraising, gathering our artistic team, consulting with the Metropolitan Organization to Counter Sexual Assault, staging developmental readings, and spending countless hours trying to build these two worlds for Kansas City audiences. Now we're just over a month away from opening. And we need your support to make it to the finish line. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need To Make This Happen</h3>
<p>We need $6,000 to help pay for our up-front costs of the production. This includes the space rental, materials for set, props, costumes, printing, etc, and payment for our artists. We are committed to paying our collaborators as much as we can, because art is work and we believe in fair payment.</p>
<p>So far, through a combination of grants and donations, we have been able to raise $3,500. We need to raise just about $2,850 to meet our goal (Indiegogo takes a 5% platform fee, which works out to $150 from $3,000, meeting our goal of $2,850. We are working artists and we want to let you know how much we appreciate your donations!</p>
<p><strong>If you donate $1-$24</strong>: you will get our eternal love &amp; gratitude!</p>
<p><strong>If you donate $25</strong>: you will get our eternal love &amp; gratitude and a poster signed by the cast and creative lead team!</p>
<p><strong>If you donate $50</strong>: you get our eternal love &amp; gratitude, a signed poster, and 1 ticket to each show</p>
<p><strong>If you donate $100</strong>: you get our eternal love &amp; gratitude, a signed poster, 1 ticket to each show, and a personal video message thank you from our team!</p>
<p><strong>If you donate $300</strong>: you get our eternal love &amp; gratitude, a signed poster, 1 ticket to each show,  a personal video message thank you from our team AND a short piece of commissioned writing from one of our playwrights!</p>
<p><strong>If you donate $1000</strong>:  you get everything from the tiers above and, you’ll get to take a prop home from our set!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why are we doing this? </h3>
<p>These plays were not made per se in direct response to #metoo — but that is because violence against women always has existed. We wish to highlight with these plays — one of which picks up where Shakespeare leaves off, and one of which weaves biblical creationism — how, despite heightened visibility, and discussion, and calls for change, the conversation looks very much the same as it did hundreds and hundreds of years ago. And we want to explore how we can move beyond that conversation. </p>
<p>That’s why we’re doing these two new women-centered, women-authored plays, in rep. We want to be a part of a nuanced dialogue: about sexual and domestic violence, and intersections of identity,  and the ways in which women survive.

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are The Terra Femina Collective, a group of Kansas City based theatre artists that, in June 2019, are doing something that has never happened in Kansas City: producing not just one, but two new plays, written by women, directed by women, in rep. Together these plays, MERELY PLAYERS by Katherine Gwynn and VIPER by Lindsay Adams, are re-framing current narratives around sexual assault and survivorship by engaging our audience in the kind of radical empathy that only theatre can inspire.
We've been working on this for nearly a year, planning, fundraising, gathering our artistic team, consulting with the Metropolitan Organization to Counter Sexual Assault, staging developmental readings, and spending countless hours trying to build these two worlds for Kansas City audiences. Now we're just over a month away from opening. And we need your support to make it to the finish line. 


What We Need To Make This Happen
We need $6,000 to help pay for our up-front costs of the production. This includes the space rental, materials for set, props, costumes, printing, etc, and payment for our artists. We are committed to paying our collaborators as much as we can, because art is work and we believe in fair payment.
So far, through a combination of grants and donations, we have been able to raise $3,500. We need to raise just about $2,850 to meet our goal (Indiegogo takes a 5% platform fee, which works out to $150 from $3,000, meeting our goal of $2,850. We are working artists and we want to let you know how much we appreciate your donations!
If you donate $1-$24: you will get our eternal love & gratitude!
If you donate $25: you will get our eternal love & gratitude and a poster signed by the cast and creative lead team!
If you donate $50: you get our eternal love & gratitude, a signed poster, and 1 ticket to each show
If you donate $100: you get our eternal love & gratitude, a signed poster, 1 ticket to each show, and a personal video message thank you from our team!
If you donate $300: you get our eternal love & gratitude, a signed poster, 1 ticket to each show,  a personal video message thank you from our team AND a short piece of commissioned writing from one of our playwrights!
If you donate $1000:  you get everything from the tiers above and, you’ll get to take a prop home from our set!

Why are we doing this? 
These plays were not made per se in direct response to #metoo — but that is because violence against women always has existed. We wish to highlight with these plays — one of which picks up where Shakespeare leaves off, and one of which weaves biblical creationism — how, despite heightened visibility, and discussion, and calls for change, the conversation looks very much the same as it did hundreds and hundreds of years ago. And we want to explore how we can move beyond that conversation. 
That’s why we’re doing these two new women-centered, women-authored plays, in rep. We want to be a part of a nuanced dialogue: about sexual and domestic violence, and intersections of identity,  and the ways in which women survive. These plays interrogate how not just patriarchy, but mental illness , queerness, and class affect rape culture. There is no one survivor narrative, and that’s what these shows, set amongst the wild and fearful, seek to do — create a space for multiple narratives.

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>Terra Alta was founded in 2017 by artist and cultural producer Elisabeth Efua Sutherland. We have  hosted over 200 individual events, 500 students, and 2 university partnerships over our 2 year history. Elisabeth Efua Sutherland has 10 years of arts education and management experience spanning 8 countries on 3 continents. She has consistently demonstrated a deep commitment to the artists and art scene in Ghana.</p>
<p>We have committed to supporting local artists especially those who work in performance, by providing the medium scale infrastructure needed to develop sustainable individual practices in the Ghanaian creative industry. We aim to scale this model across the country, continuing to build our international and pan African partnerships to promote exchange, employment, and knowledge building in the performing arts.</p>
<p>For this to happen, we need your support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Project:</h3>
<p>We need to raise USD15,000 for the new theatre space, which will measure 40 feet by 40 feet and will feature:</p>
<p>- A roofed area providing shelter from the elements</p>
<p>- A multi functional 100 seater auditorium space for rehearsals, workshops, performance and classroom use</p>
<p>- Additional studio spaces for guest artists which can double as small classroom space</p>
<p>- A floor suitable for dance and for young children to move on without getting hurt</p>
<p>We have also added a small budget for landscaping.</p>
<p>A total of about GHS106,000 (currently about USD20,660) has already been spent on the space, raised through a mixture of the artist’s own income and loans from her family. The plot is family owned and located conveniently on a busy main road with easy access to the rest of the city. We currently have:</p>
<p>- Two outdoor stages</p>
<p>- Washroom facilities</p>
<p>- A small cafe area</p>
<p>- A studio used by Elisabeth Efua Sutherland</p>
<p>- A 40 foot container currently used for dance rehearsals and storage</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Finishing this indoor facility would allow us to resume our education program for students and young children which was suspended in part due to danger from inclement weather, particularly exposure to harsh sun, insects (mosquitoes!), and rain. </p>
<p>It also means we can host up to 5 different groups at a time, since it effectively splits the space down into smaller, more intimate rooms that are still interconnected in case someone wants to have a bigger event.</p>
<p>The upstairs spaces will also allow us to host longer artist residencies for local, visiting or international artists.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Big Push</h3>
<p>We are pushing to finish this space by August 2019.</p>
<p>If we meet our deadline, we'll be able to host two resident companies and restart our programs with small children. We'll also be able to offer regular residencies to local performing artists.</p>
<p>We need you to help us make this happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Thanks for reading all the way through. This project is really special to us and we hope you can support by:</p>

<li>Giving. Every little bit helps.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm <strong>Henry Allen,</strong> founding director of what you know and love as <strong>The Folklore Theatre Company</strong>. I moved to Cape Ann in the summer of 2009 to reboot my life, just a year after losing my beloved son Cameron to brain cancer at age 13. I opened <i>The Cape Ann</i> (lovingly referred to by our community as ""<i>The Annie</i>"") to be a cultural center for downtown Gloucester, here in the heart of Cape Ann. We partnered with <strong>Fractured Atlas</strong> as our fiscal sponsor. My mission has always been to hold and care for the place-specific stories, so that the next generations will know and inherit them with pride. After all, how do we know who we are if we don't know where we come from? With our inaugural 2011 production, ""Greasy Pole, The Musical,"" our love affair with Gloucester &amp; Cape Ann began. We are proud to have sustained to this point, entering our 7th season in 2017.  This important work has been recognized by the UN and has taken our little company as far as Fiji! This is only the beginning! </li>
<li>The high rent at the Blackburn was more than we could sustain, and we knew that the magic we were creating was not in the walls, but in the people - both on stage and in the audience. We revamped, re-identified as <a href=""http://www.FolkloreTheatre.Company"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>The Folklore Theatre Company</strong></a>, and became a gypsy company for the next two years, until landing back downtown in the old Empire building at <strong>The Floating Lotus,</strong> Gloucester's new world cultural center (""The FloLo""). Now, after three successful productions, The LobstahCrackah Ballet, Dogtown Common &amp; Greasy Pole, we are ready to take things to a <i>new level</i> by transforming our studio in to a proper black box theatre. </li>
<li>By contributing to this, our first-ever capital campaign, you will help us ensure that our company can grow and sustain well into the future. Our outstanding shows and programs serve the broad and diverse community of the area, drawing folks of all ages from all over the North Shore of MA. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We hope to raise $25,000 by October 1st, 2016 (includes 10% in crowdfunding fees: 90% of funds raised will go to the FTC) to get the ball rolling on this project. Lights, staging, risers, paint, equipment... the tools to raise the production value of our awesome shows and develop our space are not cheap. Box office revenue is just not enough to cover these costs. With arts and culture funding being slashed at the State level, we must rely on our community to invest in and support our work.  </li>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary

I'm Henry Allen, founding director of what you know and love as The Folklore Theatre Company. I moved to Cape Ann in the summer of 2009 to reboot my life, just a year after losing my beloved son Cameron to brain cancer at age 13. I opened The Cape Ann (lovingly referred to by our community as ""The Annie"") to be a cultural center for downtown Gloucester, here in the heart of Cape Ann. We partnered with Fractured Atlas as our fiscal sponsor. My mission has always been to hold and care for the place-specific stories, so that the next generations will know and inherit them with pride. After all, how do we know who we are if we don't know where we come from? With our inaugural 2011 production, ""Greasy Pole, The Musical,"" our love affair with Gloucester & Cape Ann began. We are proud to have sustained to this point, entering our 7th season in 2017.  This important work has been recognized by the UN and has taken our little company as far as Fiji! This is only the beginning! 
The high rent at the Blackburn was more than we could sustain, and we knew that the magic we were creating was not in the walls, but in the people - both on stage and in the audience. We revamped, re-identified as The Folklore Theatre Company, and became a gypsy company for the next two years, until landing back downtown in the old Empire building at The Floating Lotus, Gloucester's new world cultural center (""The FloLo""). Now, after three successful productions, The LobstahCrackah Ballet, Dogtown Common & Greasy Pole, we are ready to take things to a new level by transforming our studio in to a proper black box theatre. 
By contributing to this, our first-ever capital campaign, you will help us ensure that our company can grow and sustain well into the future. Our outstanding shows and programs serve the broad and diverse community of the area, drawing folks of all ages from all over the North Shore of MA. 


What We Need & What You Get

We hope to raise $25,000 by October 1st, 2016 (includes 10% in crowdfunding fees: 90% of funds raised will go to the FTC) to get the ball rolling on this project. Lights, staging, risers, paint, equipment... the tools to raise the production value of our awesome shows and develop our space are not cheap. Box office revenue is just not enough to cover these costs. With arts and culture funding being slashed at the State level, we must rely on our community to invest in and support our work.  
The perks of supporting this project are magnificent: Season Tickets, Fabulous FTC merchandise (we will be adding show tees and company hooded sweatshirts to the list soon!), sponsorship listing in all our programs, or how about your very own year-round reserved seat with your name on it? 
If we don't reach our $25K goal with this campaign by October, we will budget what we do raise in a responsible way that will create a financial runway into our 2017 season. 
If we raise more than our $25K goal, we may hire a part-time administrative assistant, create a ""scholarship-type"" fund to cover the costs of our programs for families in need, create mentorship and cultural exchange programs to broaden the scrop of our creative youth... there is so much we can and want to do in service to our community. 


The Impact

Our downtown sorely needs a cultural center that includes a flexible, dedicated performing arts space to serve our local artists, youth through senior. This campaign would easily make this dream a reality. We even have the opportunity to expand into the space next door, which is still under construction. If we can expand our space, our vision will expand as well.
Since we opened at the Blackburn in 2011, our track record has been outstanding in consistently providing affordable, innovative productions and programs that reflect the Cape Ann experience, providing outstanding life skills-building programs for youth (including our Conservatory Lab, Young  Mystics Club, Summer Stock  & After SchoolTheatre Clubs), as well as intergenerational programs 18-senior that raise the quality of life for all involved.
The Folklore Theatre Company, one of very few year-round theatres in the region, has become a jewel in the Cape Ann crown that shines all over the North Shore. We are actively contributing to Gloucester's global reputation for innovation, and are proud of our collaborations with other service organizations and will continue to build healthy partnerships in the community. We ask our whole community to partner with us now by championing our growth and development through this campaign.

<li>There is nothing more gratifying then hearing a group of actors breathe life into your characters.</li>
<li>When creative people come together, magic can (and does) happen. </li>
<li>It’s a wonderful feeling to unite an audience in laughter or tears.</li>
<li>Often times, I am told that my writing only appeals to a niche, fringe market.   A staged reading is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate the universal appeal of my work.  Laughter unites. </li>
<li>Ever since McDonald’s switched to trans-free oil, I have not liked their French fries.</li>
<li>It is a rare opportunity for writers to hear actors and directors interpret their work and a reading is an invaluable tool. </li>
<li>They say “Great plays are not written.  They are re-written.”  I’m not sure mine is a great play, but at least it has been written.  I think that’s half the battle.</li>
<li>I think Judge Judy would make an excellent musical heroine.  She practically screams ""Jerry Herman.""</li>

A SHAMELESS SOLICITATION FOR DONATIONS
 RANDOM NOTES FROM THE AUTHOR
There is nothing more gratifying then hearing a group of actors breathe life into your characters.
When creative people come together, magic can (and does) happen. 
It’s a wonderful feeling to unite an audience in laughter or tears.
Often times, I am told that my writing only appeals to a niche, fringe market.   A staged reading is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate the universal appeal of my work.  Laughter unites. 
Ever since McDonald’s switched to trans-free oil, I have not liked their French fries.
It is a rare opportunity for writers to hear actors and directors interpret their work and a reading is an invaluable tool. 
They say “Great plays are not written.  They are re-written.”  I’m not sure mine is a great play, but at least it has been written.  I think that’s half the battle.
I think Judge Judy would make an excellent musical heroine.  She practically screams ""Jerry Herman.""
 A SHAMELESS SOLICITATION FOR DONATIONS  Joan CrawfordIf you are not familiar with Joan Crawford, there is a great chance that you are very young.  There is an even greater chance that you are straight.In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Crawford tenth on their list of the greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema.  Some of her many films include, Torch Song, The Women, Grand Hotel, Flamingo Road, Johnny Guitar, Straight Jacket and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? and her Oscar winning role as Mildred Pierce.   Her last feature film was the cult classic Trog.  She died in 1977.  Unfortunately, today Joan Crawford is probably best known as the subject of the tell-all novel Mommie Dearest. You may not have seen this film based on the book, but you’ve probably heard it quoted.  “I told you no wire clothes hangers, ever!”  A FINAL SHAMELESS SOLICITATION",2.0,9,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Boxcutter Collective 2020 Fundraiser</strong></h2>
<p>Hello! We are the Boxcutter Collective: Joe Therrien, Sam Wilson, Jason Hicks, and Tom Cunningham. We all met while working for The Bread and Puppet Theater, and have been collaborating in various combinations and projects over the last 15 years. In 2016, we formed the Boxcutter Collective to focus our energies on toppling the rotten empire that has grown and grown before our eyes. Since then, we have been making insurrectionary puppet shows at a feverish pace trying to do our part to incite the revolutionary paradigm-shift that we all know our world needs. We believe cultural change precedes political change, and to do that we need to create a wellspring of new art that the public can see, digest, and internalize as a part of the recipe for collective transformation. Your tax-deductible contribution will help us keep our ticket prices very low (usually free), compensate and feed the many volunteer artists who work with us, and support our work logistically with studio and transportation costs. This in turn, will increase the amount of audience who gets to see our shows exponentially and contribute to the cultural transformation of society towards a more just and sustainable reality.</p>
<h2>What We've Done, Where We're Headed, and What You Get!</h2>
<p>Since the fall of 2016 we have made dozens of new puppet shows that have responded to the needs of the moment. We teamed up with the Sunrise Movement and created a Coney Island Mermaid Parade contingent promoting the Green New Deal with 75 performers. We have worked with formerly incarcerated folks through a partnership with Inside Change to help teach skills and create connections for folks just getting out of jail. We've worked with dozens of other artists in different combinations, helping foster the work of new revolutionary artists, and collaborating with dozens of talented artists to bring a wave of new works to hundreds of people.</p>
<p>We believe this kind of work should be accessible to all people regardless of their financial situation. Almost all of our shows are sliding scale $0-$25. We try to keep our costs low, but we still have to rely on many hours of volunteer labor to make it work. A large part of this fundraiser is intended to be able to compensate the dozens of people who work together with us to make these shows happen. Your contribution will help us pay artists and feed them at our rehearsals and shows. Being able to compensate artists, even nominally, will greatly increase their ability to commit their time and talent to the work and increase the amount of audience who gets to see our shows exponentially. We also are raising money to help with the very real costs of studio rental in NYC, and other logistical and transportation needs that are an inescapable reality of schlepping puppet shows from Brooklyn to the rest of the world. </p>
<p>But I know what you are asking yourself -what do YOU get out of contributing to this Quixotic quest to flood the free market with a deluge of post-pre-post consumerist existentialist anti-deepfake pro-human propaganda? Well, besides our deepest gratitude and a promise that we will work even harder to convince the world it’s worth saving -we’ll give you puppets! &amp; prints! &amp; shows in your living rooms! Even a lecture on the history of the Beach Boys by Tom! (for real -he knows a lot). Check out our perks for more information.</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>We are hoping to connect with people who want to support our work and are in a financial situation where they feel comfortable to do so. If you are broke -we don’t want you to become broker because of us! But we would you ask you to please share this campaign on your social media accounts, through email, through conversations IN REAL LIFE, and in any other ways you can think to help get the world out. Help connect us with the rich weirdos who want to fund the cultural revolution!</p>
<p>And if you ARE one of those rich weirdos -well, what are you waiting for? Donate now and support the kind of art that is trying to change minds, hearts, and shift consciousnesses in direct defiance of the overwhelming odds against us.</p>
<h2>Read What John Bell, Paul Zaloom, &amp;Dick Zygun have to say about The Boxcutter Collective: </h2>
<p>""BoxCutter Collective is making new and exciting theater work addressing the challenging issues we all face, with humor, music, and brilliant puppets, masks, sets, and an activist perspective. They deserve your support!""</p>
<p><strong>-John Bell, America's Puppet Professor and Member of Great Small Works</strong></p>
<p>“It’s rare to find a puppet theater on this planet with the kind of quality, integrity, and absolute hilariousness of the remarkable Boxcutter Collective. Their super creative use of puppets carries on the ancient tradition of irreverent and joyfully rude puppetry that has confronted injustice and tyranny from time immemorial. I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically recommend the Boxcutter Collective and their hilarious puppet shows.”</p>

This year we will transform this former artist studio into <strong>The Studio at Winwick</strong> which will serve as an artistic base for <strong>The Adaptations Project </strong>for the creation of new works.

 Our intention however is to keep the facility modest and in line with that of the simple environs. Even with the volunteers and in-kind donations we expect and hope to receive to achieve all this, it is absolutely necessary that we must fundraise. All of the money we raise in this $20K for 2020 campaign will entirely go toward the studio renovation. Truthfully, it will take almost double that amount to complete the transformation. And so, it is critical we reach this particular benchmark by the end of March in order to begin work. On a personal note:I've had 20 years of collaborating, creating works, touring and teaching internationally in 8 different countries including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Germany, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Thailand, and Turkey. Looking outward has been incredibly fulfilling. At this time, I look forward to shifting this energy to create an inspiring oasis where ideas can incubate, where community and collaboration can flourish in an intimate space in a natural environment far away from distractions. It's an ambitious endeavor, but I am wholly committed to this labor of love. As Yoko Ono says ""A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality."" I've made the first leap and I've taken the first critical steps, but with your help we can make this dream a reality. Please consider making a contribution. Any level of support now would be greatly appreciated. And we welcome your help in spreading the word to those who might be interested in supporting our endeavor.Lastly, the format of the residency will be announced at a later date. If you are a theatre maker or dancer or performing artist who may be interested in a residency, then please email residencies@adaptationsproject.org to be kept informed of upcoming application deadlines and info.  - Donnie Mather",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Dear Friends, </p>
<p>It's almost impossible to imagine how far things have come over the last 5 years and so many of you, in one way or another, have been a genuine part of it.  From the bottom of my heart, I simply can't thank you enough.  When I first conceived of Tales from the Trundle back in 2012 it started out as my way of using creativity to deal with getting out of a very toxic marriage filled with unhappiness and abuse. Cultivating and relying on my sense of humor, I created this piece to help and inspire other women. It then, hit the stage at the United Solo Festival, will soon be at a private location in NYC and believe it or not I have the chance to take the show all the way to Paris. Paris! And London! And Paris!!   </p>
<p>As no good deed should ever go unpunished, I am asking for some direct support from you my super generous friends (and anyone else you think would want to make this unbelievable opportunity a reality). If this can come together, this one woman show about surviving from and thriving after domestic violence, women's empowerment, and our innate ability to transform and manifest absolutely everything we dream of and more! ""Saying No to what no longer serves us begins to serve All of Us."" This story is not about me showing the audience my acting abilities, it's with the hopes of reaching and inspiring a larger audience for a greater cause. This is very much a woman's story, not solely my story. The Tales I tale will start resonating with folks far beyond the cobblestone streets of TriBeCa or Brooklyn! </p>
<p>So now the icky part. I'm looking to raise $75K. That will cover the costs for 12 shows in 2 cities over the summer. The costs simply cover theater fees, travel costs for me and my director and friend James, light and sound technicians, accommodations, meals, and marketing. I can still pull this off if I raise at least $40,000 but the full amount of the campaign will allow me to bring it back to NYC for a solid theater run in the Fall and then continue onto Los Angeles. My intention is to incorporate and invite women's organizations, such as domestic violence survivors, women's empowerment groups, and the like.</p>
<p>Every dollar counts and while I'll be coming up with a list of benefits that correspond with donation amount, truthfully the real benefit is that you would be helping a dream come true in the most authentic sense.  </p>
<p>Please, please if you have any questions about any of this or just want to hear how crazy the preparations are for the European adventure, don't hesitate to reach out.  And of course whether you can give a grand (or 2) or a dollar, it all means so much to me. Click the link to donate.  THANK YOU!</p>
<p>Warmest,</p>
