</p><p>Hopkinton is very fortunate to have <b>two</b> Destination Imagination teams win the Massachusetts State
Championships (<a href=""http://www.MADIkids.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.MADIkids.org</a>) for
their challenges and these teams have been invited to compete at the
Destination Imagination Global Final competition (<a href=""http://www.globalfinals2014.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.globalfinals2014.org</a>) in
Knoxville, TN, May 21-24. 
Congratulations to the 7<sup>th</sup> grade Middle School team of Aren Arakelian, Neal Patel, Patrick Webb,
Austin Marques, Izzy Puri, Niha Gopi, Eva Kuruvilla (Team Manager: Leda
Arakelian) and to the 5<sup>th</sup> grade Hopkins School team of Elizabeth
Kane, Tara Joshi, Paige Lavelanet, Ceara Perry, Mia Sannicandro, Vani Sharma,
Sara Bernardo (Team Manager: Cindy Bernardo - Co Manager: Haley Bernardo.) 
These kids have worked very hard for several months on their community
service projects (benefiting the Hopkinton Senior Center, Golden Pond, and
Soldier’s Angels) – and after all that hard work and practice, they each won
the regional tournament in Uxbridge and won their challenges at the MA state
championships.  Their hard work has paid
off, and they are now invited to compete internationally at the DI Global
Finals.</p>
<p>Attending Global Finals is a huge opportunity for these
students.  The week includes not only the
DI competition for their central challenges and instant challenges, but
also includes several learning opportunities including an Innovation Expo and
interaction opportunities with National Geographic and NASA.   For
the kids, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.  </p>
<p>However, the cost to travel and attend the competition seems
insurmountable, and we are hoping that we can raise funds to cover or defray
these costs.  Hopkinton hopes to send two
teams, each of seven children, with one parent to accompany each child.  The cost of the registration fees, housing,
airfare, transfers, for the two teams is well <u>in excess of $40,000</u>! </p>
<p>We are reaching out to our community to help us fund this
opportunity for them.  A donation in any amount
would be greatly appreciated.  The
children will be holding various fundraising events to help them get to
Knoxville, and the first of these is this on-line donation page.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for supporting these
wonderful, gifted, and community-minded children!  It is very much appreciated.</p>

Tasuleasa Social has partnered with Synergis Counseling in order to provide young Romanians with training and and mentorship on two issues: 

(1) affirm themselves globally as equal partners and leaders, while keeping a solid connection to their local cultural values and heritage; 

(2) pitch their ideas, knowledge and talent to potential partners and investors around the world. 
The pilot training will take place August 1-10, 2014 in the Carpathian mountains of Transylvania, Romania. It will be followed by online workshops and the creation of a Leadership University, with on site and virtual classes throughout the year. Our Top Donors receive FREE PARTICIPATION AT THIS SUMMER TRAINING IN TRANSYLVANIA. WHO WE ARE
Tasuleasa Social is a Romanian non-profit organization founded by Alin Useriu-Uhlmann in 2001, with the purpose of creating meaningful impact at a social, environmental and cultural level. 

Synergis Counseling is a partnership between Cosmin Gheorghe and Patricia Rojas-Zambrano (see details bellow). Synergis is located in San Francisco, California and offers counseling, executive coaching and organizational development training.  
ALIN USERIU-UHLMANN: ""Dare To Dream!""Alin is a TEDx speaker and one of the ten Romanians nominalized by Discovery Channel in their Anybody Can Be a Hero campaign.  In 2001, upon his return to Romania after living a few years abroad, Alin found his childhood land undergoing an ecological disaster. He started building Tășuleasa Social, a volunteers' wonderland in Bistrița, Northern Transylvania, with the steady purpose of ""changing mentalities and engaging in mindful and meaningful activities"".COSMIN GHEORGHE: ""Local Passion, Global Purpose"" Born and raised in Romania where he graduated as an MD in General Medicine, Cosmin moved in 2000 to California to study psychology. A Huffington Post blogger and enthusiast of global entrepreneurship, Cosmin uses his skills and knowledge of human relationships and communication to coach individuals and organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley on issues like global leadership and culture change. PATRICIA ROJAS-ZAMBRANO: ""Expressive Arts Social for Change"" Patricia is a native Colombian working in Berkeley and San Francisco, licensed psychotherapist, co-founder of Synergis Counseling (together with Cosmin) and founder of Expressive Arts Social and Art Journaling Workshops. As the Secretary and Executive Leadership Team for International Expressive Arts Therapy Association, Patricia seeks to inspire at a global level in the transformative power of the arts. She provides counseling and training for effective social change. WHY IS THIS PROJECT IMPORTANT FOR US AND THE WORLD All three of us are born and raised in rather small, often ""invisible"" cultures, which often have difficulties situating their value and participation in a globalized world. And all three of us have followed our passion and purpose, adventuring outside of our comfort zone to become ""global locals"". We want now to gift further our knowledge and experience. Through Mentorship and Training we will provide precisely this guidance, to those who need it in the moments they need it the most.PILOT TRAINING (August 1-10, 2014). The training will consist in global leadership interactive seminars (morning-noon, with Cosmin) and expressive arts social processing (after-noons to evenings, with Patricia). Training will be centered around two large themes. I. The impact of cultural values on the behavior and decision-making of entrepreneurs and leaders. The seminars will use rigorous academic intercultural research, which has been performed for the past decades in over 90 countries. We will talk about Power and Hierarchy, Uncertainty Avoidance and Social Anxiety, Individualism and Collectivism, Direct or Indirect Communication, and much more. II. The interplay between Personal Cultural Identity and Global Identity, and how they are influenced by cultural values, norms and rituals.  What We Need & What You GetAlin generously offered Tasuleasa Social facilities. Cosmin and Patricia will donate their time and free leadership training, counseling and mentorship. They will also offer a limited number of free counseling and consulting sessions as perks for donors, and will invest time in promoting this campaign to potential donors for the next 60 days. Our Global Leadership project is not possible without your contribution. The first group of hopeful 30 young Romanian leaders is waiting for us and for YOU. Remember, our top 3 donors will be coming with us for the duration of the camp in the heart and soul of Romania: Bistrița, Transylvania! If you cannot attend this summer, your place will be reserved for any other Synergis-Tasuleasa Social event or training. Please see our Donors Perks bellow! We are offering absolute transparency of this project: free accommodation for our top three donors, who are invited to be with us in Transylvania and experience the project first hand!Other perks include reduced fee counseling, digital video-photo albums, reduced fee personal or executive coaching, and intercultural and organizational consulting, as well as original paintings by Patricia Rojas-Zambrano - we placed the pictures of the paintings here, since there is no picture space in the perks section: ""SAILORS' ANGEL"" - mixed-media 36""x48"" (90x120cm)SHAMAN'S DREAM - acrylic on paper 12""x19"" (31x48cm)MAYA SERPENT - mixed media on bristol paper 18""x24"" inches (46x61cm) The ImpactYour donation will have a world wide impact, as a result of the global projects developed by young Romanian entrepreneurs.

Help me keep Playing At Learning afloat  - it does amazing work in inspiring  youth in STEM.  The short of it?  I'm raising $49,000 in 49 days for Playing At Learning, an amazing, all-volunteer nonprofit that benefits our young people and inspires them towards STEM Careers!  I need your help to make it happen!  

 In full disclosure  (aka the small print) - I co-founded Playing At Learning and am currently the president (as a part-time volunteer) of the nonprofit.  I receive NONE of the funds and will never take a salary from Playing At Learning. I have a separate full-time day job that I love.  




What We Need & What You Get

<h2>So What's This All About?</h2>
<h3>About me:</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Carolyn Bonini. I am 18 years old. I was brought up in the Poconos, PA, but now I live in Bridgeport, CT. I just graduated from Bridgeport International Academy (Yay!). </p>
<p>If you would like to contact me, email me at: <a href=""mailto:carebonini@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">carebonini@gmail.com</a></p>
<h3>What I'm doing:</h3>
<p>Next year, I will be taking a gap year in Europe. I have been accepted into 2 major programs. The first program I'll attend is called <a href=""http://www.esgd.org/514.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">D.O.N.E.</a> (Development of New Environments). It is based off of Slovakia. On this program we will be doing service projects, character education, a mountain challenge, even some self-defense. This program will last approximately 3 months.</p>
<p>After the D.O.N.E. program, I will be <a href=""http://www.wwoofinternational.org/welcome-to-wwoof/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WWOOFing</a>. I will stay with a host family and help them tend to their farm in exchange for accomodation and food. I will have this great opportunity to learn about a new culture and meet interesting and eco-friendly people, while learning quite a lot about organic farming.</p>
<h3>Where the money goes:</h3>
<p>Any contributions made toward my adventures will strictly go toward that specific purpose. All donations are GREATLY appreciated - so greatly appreciated that I offer you my unique and handmade PERKS (look on the right of the campaign). Also if you have any tips or advice for my travels, especially about VISAs, I would love for you to email me (look above). Thanks for all of your help!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What I Need, &amp; What You Could Receive!</h2>
<p>I have already raised a thousand dollars on my own, which covers the cost of the D.O.N.E program and supplies for the trip, but I still need 2 thousand more to cover part of the costs below.</p>
<h3>I need funds for the basics, including:</h3>
<ul>
<li>the plane tickets, there &amp; back again...</li>
<li>traveling between countries (between programs)</li>
<li>emergency cash just in case</li>
</ul>
<h3>Perks!</h3>
<p>If you donate, I've got some great perks you could receive. There are handmade friendship bracelets, cards, earrings, even covers of the songs that you love. I have experience selling the earrings I've made, so you know they're legit! As for the music, for those of you who don't know me, I have a lot of experience performing and covering songs.</p>
<p>As for the largest perks, you can receive a book I printed of my travels, or larger bundles. The book will have a lot of pictures and funny stories, along with random adventures that were really meaningful to me, and hopefully will be for you, too. The larger bundles are explained in the descriptions. I will love you forever if you purchase one of them. </p>
<p>I've also got some randomly awesome perks mixed in, which I virtual pinky promise on doing. I will even take pictures and/or video as evidence that l do them. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a HUGE opportunity for me. :) I will be taken completely out of my comfort zone. It is my first step as an independent person. I believe that through this trip, I will gather a stronger understanding on how I want to impact the world. This is a necessary step in order for me to pick the direction I want my life to go.</p>
<p>I have never gone on a trip so far from home, however I have been on more local programs. One example of this was <a href=""http://www.shehaquavisionquest.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vision Quest</a>, in which we traveled the Northeast of the U.S. and did some community service projects for the Penobscot Indian Nation. I fundraised for that program as well, and all of the proceeds went toward that trip.</p>
<p>I promise that your funds will be in safe hands, and that I will use them purely for my education and travels in Europe. Thanks so much. :O)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Don't sweat it if you can't donate. Getting the word out is just as helpful. It would be awesome if you could share this with your friends and family. There are some share tools on this page that you could use. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!</p>

students attend university.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>In Guatemala, there are more than 6 million indigenous
inhabitants (60% of the country’s total population), yet the majority continues
to lag behind the non-indigenous population in social statistics: they are 2.8
times poorer and have 13 years less life expectancy. <a href=""http://www.iwgia.org/regions/latin-america/guatemala"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.iwgia.org/regions/latin-america/guatemala"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">It is estimated that only 5% of university students are indigenous.</a></p>
<p><b>We
want to change this reality.</b></p>
<p>The students involved in our Youth
Education Program are bright, creative, socially-conscious individuals that
hope to contribute positively to their communities and create significant change
in Guatemala. We want to provide them with all the support necessary in
reaching their highest potential and achieving their dreams.</p>
<p>We currently have 10
students who would like to attend university next year, but because of
financial difficulty, they won’t be able to without your help.</p>
<p>Our students have a
range of desired interests. Pedro wants to study system engineering. Sucely wants to study business administration. German wants to study medicine. Vicky wants to
study social work. </p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Where will your funds go?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Depending on the desired
field of study, university tuition in Guatemala can cost anywhere from $750 to
$1,200 a year. This price does not include the costs of commuting to and from
school, food, books, printing, or the myriad of other costs associated with
attending school. Many of these families struggle to make ends meet and simply cannot
afford to send their children to university, when they can be working instead.</p>
<p>Through your donation,
you will be <b>directly</b> supporting our
students in their efforts to further their education, increase their knowledge,
and better their lives as well as that of their families and communities. </p>
<p>We want to raise enough
money to support each student with $1,000.00 per year towards their education. And
if you help us raise more than $10,000, we will be able to support more than 10
students!</p>
<p>As well as financial
support, Maya Traditions Foundation will offer these students’ personal and professional
development with workshops throughout the year, tutoring, and ongoing academic guidance and moral support provided by our Programs
Coordinator. </p>
<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p>Having served indigenous children and
families for over fifteen years in partnership with Maya Educational Foundation, Maya Traditions, or known locally as Fundación Tradiciones Mayas, is an essential
part of the education solution in Guatemala. As our students have reached the
age of university, we want to continue to support them in their efforts to further
their education.</p>
<p>Benedicto Ixtamer, a long-term scholarship
recipient, shares his success in a recent testimonial: </p>
<p>“Fundación Tradiciones Mayas is part of the
seed in the formation of a student. Actually, Fundación Tradiciones Mayas is
one of the strongest organizations helping indigenous people and students
towards a better life. I especially thank you for supporting me in my formation
as a student and adult.  I believe that
life is built day by day and made step by step. After graduating as an
elementary school teacher, it was difficult for me to find work in teaching
because in our government system, everything depends on your connections. But
my enthusiasm persisted, and I began to devote myself to painting and started
to guide tourists to attractive places. In 2004, I eventually came to the
United States to exhibit my paintings. After my trip, I rented land to start a
language school in my village. We then bought land and began a formal school to
teach languages. In 2005, with the support of parents of children with
disabilities, we formed a legal NGO for people with disabilities. With my
enthusiasm, we have managed to make contacts in the administrative system of
education in Guatemala to officially declare us as a Public School for Children
with Disabilities.  Every year I continue
to travel abroad to exhibit my art, and was most recently in Telluride,
Colorado with the arts and advocacy organization Mountainfilm. I have also
currently been working on a community garden in my village where people can
grow vegetables to better their nutrition and daily diet. None of this would
have been possible without the early support and guidance of Fundación
Tradiciones Mayas.”  </p>
<p>Through a comprehensive Youth Education
Program, Maya Traditions ensures the integral development of our students,
working to improve attendance rates of students at all grade levels through
economic support that offsets educational expenses, accompanying students in
their educational pursuits by offering tutoring and year-round staff support,
and contributing to the professional and personal development of young people
to become thoughtful, analytical and creative community leaders, as
demonstrated in Benedicto Ixtamer’s statement.</p>

<p></p></span></div>","We are Maya Traditions Foundation, based in Panajachel, Guatemala. Together with Maya Educational Foundation (MEF), we are asking for your help in supporting ten of our brightest
students attend university.

In Guatemala, there are more than 6 million indigenous
inhabitants (60% of the country’s total population), yet the majority continues
to lag behind the non-indigenous population in social statistics: they are 2.8
times poorer and have 13 years less life expectancy. It is estimated that only 5% of university students are indigenous.
We
want to change this reality.
The students involved in our Youth
Education Program are bright, creative, socially-conscious individuals that
hope to contribute positively to their communities and create significant change
in Guatemala. We want to provide them with all the support necessary in
reaching their highest potential and achieving their dreams.
We currently have 10
students who would like to attend university next year, but because of
financial difficulty, they won’t be able to without your help.
Our students have a
range of desired interests. Pedro wants to study system engineering. Sucely wants to study business administration. German wants to study medicine. Vicky wants to
study social work. 

Where will your funds go?

Depending on the desired
field of study, university tuition in Guatemala can cost anywhere from $750 to
$1,200 a year. This price does not include the costs of commuting to and from
school, food, books, printing, or the myriad of other costs associated with
attending school. Many of these families struggle to make ends meet and simply cannot
afford to send their children to university, when they can be working instead.
Through your donation,
you will be directly supporting our
students in their efforts to further their education, increase their knowledge,
and better their lives as well as that of their families and communities. 
We want to raise enough
money to support each student with $1,000.00 per year towards their education. And
if you help us raise more than $10,000, we will be able to support more than 10
students!
As well as financial
support, Maya Traditions Foundation will offer these students’ personal and professional
development with workshops throughout the year, tutoring, and ongoing academic guidance and moral support provided by our Programs
Coordinator. 
The Impact
Having served indigenous children and
families for over fifteen years in partnership with Maya Educational Foundation, Maya Traditions, or known locally as Fundación Tradiciones Mayas, is an essential
part of the education solution in Guatemala. As our students have reached the
age of university, we want to continue to support them in their efforts to further
their education.
Benedicto Ixtamer, a long-term scholarship
recipient, shares his success in a recent testimonial: 
“Fundación Tradiciones Mayas is part of the
seed in the formation of a student. Actually, Fundación Tradiciones Mayas is
one of the strongest organizations helping indigenous people and students
towards a better life. I especially thank you for supporting me in my formation
as a student and adult.  I believe that
life is built day by day and made step by step. After graduating as an
elementary school teacher, it was difficult for me to find work in teaching
because in our government system, everything depends on your connections. But
my enthusiasm persisted, and I began to devote myself to painting and started
to guide tourists to attractive places. In 2004, I eventually came to the
United States to exhibit my paintings. After my trip, I rented land to start a
language school in my village. We then bought land and began a formal school to
teach languages. In 2005, with the support of parents of children with
disabilities, we formed a legal NGO for people with disabilities. With my
enthusiasm, we have managed to make contacts in the administrative system of
education in Guatemala to officially declare us as a Public School for Children
with Disabilities.  Every year I continue
to travel abroad to exhibit my art, and was most recently in Telluride,
Colorado with the arts and advocacy organization Mountainfilm. I have also
currently been working on a community garden in my village where people can
grow vegetables to better their nutrition and daily diet. None of this would
have been possible without the early support and guidance of Fundación
Tradiciones Mayas.”  
Through a comprehensive Youth Education
Program, Maya Traditions ensures the integral development of our students,
working to improve attendance rates of students at all grade levels through
economic support that offsets educational expenses, accompanying students in
their educational pursuits by offering tutoring and year-round staff support,
and contributing to the professional and personal development of young people
to become thoughtful, analytical and creative community leaders, as
demonstrated in Benedicto Ixtamer’s statement.

However, you are 100% guaranteed to receive your choices at the end of our process... so keep visiting to see what we're cooking up!
For every soap in production, there is a short description along with a picture of the class working on the creation of the soaps. The soaps are being constantly tweaked to reach their full potential with each bar of finished soap measuring approximately 2"" x 2.5"" x 1"" in size (or of comparable volume in circular forms). The soaps below are just the tip of the iceberg. With your help, we move on to the really crazy stuff!

Floral Explosion:
From the soapmaker: Floral Explosion is a floral soap with notes of Lily of the Valley and subtle notes of magnolia and rose. The soap gently exfoliates with rose petals and is a light pink color. It conditions dry skin and is creamy, so you get the best hand-washing experience. You will be budding with delight! Pun intended.
Ingredients: Palm Oil (30%); Castor Oil (20%); Hemp Oil (20%); Apricot Kernel Oil (10%); Shea Butter (10%); Coconut Oil (10%); Handpicked Rose Petals
Scents: Floral Bouquet; Lily of the Valley; Rose; Lavender; Hyacinth; Lilac; Magnolia Oils

Christmas Blend:
From the soapmaker: This soap will be everything you like about Christmas in a single bar of delicious-smelling soap. Christmas Blend is well balanced in all its properties, and appears as a lovely green, red, and white marbled bar. It cleans well while leaving you smelling wonderful.
Ingredients: Coconut Oil (25%); Vegetable Oil (25%); Palm Oil (25%); Sunflower Oil (25%); Mint Leaves
Scent: Peppermint Oil
Lavender Swirl:
From the soapmaker: Our soap is a creamy mixture of  palm, coconut, and grapeseed oils. This relatively hard bar will be subtly bubbly while cleansing and conditioning to your skin. The final bar of soap will be purple and cream marbled together. It will be lavender scented with a textured top, and free of exfoliants.
Ingredients: Palm Oil (50%); Coconut Oil (25%); Grapeseed Oil (25%)
Scent: Lavender Oil
Holiday Surprise:
From the soapmaker: Holiday Surprise is a beautiful green shimmering round soap with hand selected fresh, local, organic pine needles from Cabot.

The pure shea butter will leave your skin feeling very soft and conditioned after a nice wash!
Ingredients: Coconut Oil (40%); Shea Butter (20%); Castor Oil (20%); Cocoa Butter (20%); Softened pine needles
Scent: Tea Tree and Pine Oils

Coconut Delight:
From the soapmaker: Coconut Delight is a splendid mix of coconut and chocolate. This soap will leave you feeling cleansed and delighted, with the coconut flakes fused into the soap you will feel like you just finished swimming in the Caribbean. When you’re done using your soap, everybody will be asking you when you got back from your vacation... little will they realize that you’ve just been using some first-rate soap.
Ingredients: Sunflower Oil (40%); Cocoa Butter (30%); Coconut Oil (30%); Coconut shavings
Scents: Coconut and Chocolate Oils
Chock Full O’ Mint:

Ingredients: Coconut Oil (35%); Cocoa Butter (35%); Shea Butter (30%); Dried Wild Mint
Scents: Spearmint and Dark Chocolate Oils



Oatmeal Cedarwood

From the soapmakers: Made for those of us who prefer the scent of nature and the outdoors, oatmeal cedarwood leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed while imparting a subtle hint of cedar in the process. The oatmeal combines with other oils to produce a healing skin formula that helps condition your body after a long excursion or chilly winter walk.Ingredients: Palm Oil (43%); Coconut Oil (32%); Olive Oil (23%); Castor Oil (2%); Steel-cut oats
Scent: Pure Cedarwood Oils





The Frankenbar
From the soapmakers: Back by popular demand and constructed from the amalgamation of soapmaking trimmings during our shaping process, each Frankenbar is completely unique in composition.  After select soap fragments are compiled together into each one-of-a-kind creation, we seal the fragments with pure, moisturizing vegetable glycerin for an unexpected (and often entertaining!) cleansing experience.
Ingredients: Random assortment of above soaps; glycerin

Scent: ""Oh, it's its own thing.""



The Purist
From the soapmaker: Like your tastes, we'll keep our description simple. A bar of unscented, unadulterated, wonderfully moisturizing soap composed of pure vegetable glycerin. And hey... it's even clear!
Ingredients: Glycerin
Scent: None

<p>Cascadia is a choice-based learning cooperative whose goal is to enrich learning and build community for homeschoolers in the Eugene/Springfield area.  Children ages 6-13 can choose from a list of engaging classes, play with other
homeschooled children, and learn from a variety of caring adults.  The goal of Cascadia Learning Cooperative is
not to take the place of the important work of homeschooling, but to offer
supplemental enrichment classes such as in the arts, Spanish, writing, geography, history, and gamewriting.  As
a cooperative, parent involvement is central and key to its success, which
creates a unique and intimate learning environment.  It is a place for families to learn, grow and
build community together!</p>
<p>Research shows that homelearning is
possibly the fastest form of education in the United States and also growing in
many other nations such as the UK, Australia, Japan and Canada.  There are approximately 2.2 million children
homeschooling in the U.S. for a variety of reasons and from a variety of
backgrounds.*  Some families have a
desire to provide more a non-traditional approach to learning; some families
want to individualize the learning environment and studies for each child; some
wish to accomplish more academically than they can in a traditional school; and
some for religious reasons.  Whatever the
reason, homeschooling and unschooling is growing in America, and families are
uniting to build their homeschooling communities through social media, email
groups, regular playdates and learning cooperatives like ours.  </p>
<p>Learning cooperatives like Cascadia
are starting to form all over the country. 
They provide socialization for the children, academic and special
interest classes, and provide social and educational support for parents.  They are a bridge between traditional schools
and homelearning.  They are unique to
each community, and community based.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3> <p></p>
<p>As
a new program, the cooperative operates on a very small budget to keep costs
affordable for families.  We have started
off with the bare minimum, but now that we are up and running, we have so much
more that we would like to do!  Our
current goal is to purchase some basic equipment that will enhance the ability
of our instructors to teach and provide resources and learning opportunities
for the children.  Our goal is to
purchase:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Four laptop computers;</p>
<p>·<span>  Two </span>projectors;</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>One laser copier/printer.</p>
<p>A laser
copier/printer is the highest priority because they would serve the basic
functioning of the cooperative.  As
it stands, teachers are responsible for printing all of their materials off campus at their own expense.  They cannot make any extra copies of
materials or spontaneously print something when children’s
interests are piqued or the need arises.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Projectors are our second priority,
and could be used in any one of our classes as a teaching tool.  Giving teachers the capability to prepare a lesson/material
at home and then project it on the wall with a laptop computer would improve
classroom efficiency and allow access to more teaching resources.  Currently, Cascadia does not own or have
access to any audio-visual or computer equipment. </p>
<p>Laptop computers are our third
priority, and would likely be used in at least half of all classes
offered.  Teachers could use laptops in
conjunction with a projector or to prepare class materials during a break.  Students would also be able to make use of
computers for in-class research, or in certain classes where computer use is
required (e.g., video game writing). </p>
<p></p>
<p>The potential for projector and/or
computer use is exciting to Cascadia teachers, as access to this equipment
would open the chest of a vast treasure trove of classroom resources.  As one teacher commented,</p>
<p>“I utilize the NASA website as my curriculum.  It is loaded
with information for teachers of all grades.  They have great informative
videos to go with many of their lessons.  I would love to be able to show
these to my class to complement what I am teaching.  They also have great
educational games to complement some of their lessons.  I think it would
be beneficial to my class to utilize the different technical modalities offered
to drive the lesson home to the kids in the all the ways they learn.  We
do a LOT of hands on learning, but often the lesson is better learned when
presented in different ways, digitally being one of them.”</p>
<p>  ~Ericka
Rhodes, Beyond the Sky Teacher</p>
<p>“Clearly the video 'Game Writing’ class could benefit (from access to a laptop computer).
 There is at least one kid who couldn't take the class because she didn't
have access to a computer.  Others have old computers that don't hold
charges and limit our ability to sit at regular seating arrangements and risk
tripping hazards on the cords.  The projector would be fantastic because I
can't demonstrate on a computer for all to see what to do in the class.  I
have to tell them what to do and then go from kid to kid to see if they have it
right.  Even for my younger children’s writing class, if I had a
projector, I could have prompts and parts of sentences written and projected
for them to copy.”</p>
<p>  ~Tina
Fredette, Game Writing and Twist and Fold Writing Teacher</p>
<p>“Tomorrow in the ‘Kids Write
the News’ class we will interview kids in an alternative school in Costa Rica, and
vice versa, using my iPad here and a teacher's laptop there. We tested connections recently and it would be awesome to have a larger screen. I would like
to teach a joint biology and ecology class (both schools at same time) this
spring, focused on children's forests and forest ecology in both places. A laptop
and projector would be very useful!”</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Your contribution would make an
impact on the next generation.  There are many ways we can teach our
children, and many ways children learn.  While public school works for
many children and their families, homeschooling and unschooling is another
important learning pathway.  Supporting Cascadia Learning Cooperative will
enhance the learning experience, provide options, and create an intimate
learning community for homeschooling and unschooling children.  More
specifically, these funds will be able to take some of the burden of providing
resources off teachers; give children opportunities that they may not have at
home; and enhancing the learning experience and widen the learning community
for the children.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Learning cooperatives like Cascadia
are new and untested.  But homeschooling
is growing, and it is our belief that places like Cascadia will continue to
grow and become valuable assets in communities across the nation. They are opportunities to broaden the scope of education, providing multiple possibilities for different learners at different stages of their lives. </p>
<p>Cascadia is a cooperative, thus
depends on the families that choose to enroll their children to teach classes,
supervise playtimes, coordinate social gatherings, fund-raise and more.  But we do have an administrator, Melissa Palma, who has done
this before, and done it successfully!  Melissa started and managed a farmers market in Ypsilanti, Michigan and 
it is in its 9th season. She also started and managed a democratic, free school in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which is in its 5th year.  She is well versed in managing the ups and downs of running a small school and ensuring it is a long term success.</p>

Our dream is to successfully increase the eye contact skills, pronunciation, and speaking skills of users in one iOS application. 
Long term benefits for users could be: increased high school graduation rates for individuals, leadership development, better interviewing skills for pre-professional or continuing educational opportunities, successful networking opportunities, and stronger interpersonal relationships. 
Your money will directly contribute to the acceleration of the development of our iPad application, and increase awareness of this venture and product. You are enabling the success of our solution to social skills issues.

<p>Hello, I'm Thomas A. Griffin.  I need your help to complete my personal dream.  I want to go back to school and finish earning my college degree.  However, I need your help to overcome the obstacles caused by my physical disabilities.  I have had heart surgery, have a pace maker, and am legally blind in one eye.</p>
<p>Let me explain my situation and background.  In the fall of 1999, I attended Ellsworth Community College in Iowa Falls, Iowa. I did not have any financial aid funding at the time, so I studied hard to raise my GPA so that eventually I would be able to qualify for financial aid. I paid half of my school fees with money saved from work at minimum wage. At the end of my Fall Semester I was successful in raising my GPA, but was running short on funds.  I could not pay the balance of the costs for the Fall Semester and so the school would not let me register for the Spring Semester.  I decided to take time off from school in order to work and save more money to pay for my education costs before returning to school again.  However, things didn't go as planned because after I started working I developed a very serious health problem.</p>
<p>I returned home to South Carolina in December 1999 and searched for full-time employment while working short term temporary assignments. Eventually in November 2000 I was hired in a local B.M.W. Auto Parts Plant (Pierburg, Inc.) as a Production Line Employee for $9.00 an Hour. <strong>In March 2001 I was diagnosed with a very bad Cardiac Mitrol-Valve Prolapse that required open heart surgery.</strong> The company pushed me out of work onto short term medical leave until my June 15, 2001 surgery date for open heart surgery. On June 25, 2001 I was terminated by certified letter due to my need to be out of work for 90 Days following surgery.  The surgery required my sternum to be sawed in half so that my ribs could be spread apart to allow access to my heart, so it took time for the bone to mend back together and the incisions to heal. </p>
<p>After the 90 day waiting period, I was unable to find employment and could not get federally funded employment training due to my being fired while on medical leave.  I applied for Social Security Disability, but it was a long, drawn-out process, during which I had no income.  Finally, years later, I was able to obtain my Social Security Disability Benefits.  Because my claim was originally denied, I had to get a lawyer to help me.  When I was finally awarded disability status, I was paid for the years during which I was pursuing the claim, but my lawyer’s fees ate up over a third of that amount. </p>
<p>My small monthly income from my disability benefits barely covers my basic living expenses, health insurance premium payments, and medical fees.  I pay my parents $250.00 a month to live at their home, and I help to buy food.  I pay physician copays and buy my medications with pharmacy insurance and copays.  Because of having an artificial heart valve, I will have to take blood-thinner medications my entire life.  I had to get a pacemaker installed in March 2011 because I had developed a heart arrhythmia.  My car was repossessed in March 2009 after getting behind on payments.</p>
<p><strong>I'm trying to pay off the remainder of my past college debts so that I will be able to obtain my transcripts, which are being held by the college business office until my debt is paid. I cannot obtain college student loans to help pay future tuition until my college debts are paid in full.  Another important reason I need my transcripts released is so that I can transfer credit hours for classes that I completed in the past, which will allow me to complete my degree much faster and save money.</strong>  Once the transcripts are released I can then apply for admission to Ellsworth Community College for a Degree in Business Management or  to Indian Hills Community College for a Degree in Culinary Arts and Entrepreneurship.  Without either degree I have little hope of finding employment or being able to live independently. In South Carolina,  you need to have income that meets or exceeds three times your rent cost to apply for an apartment in a complex.  I can’t meet this requirement without working.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2012 I lost the eye sight in my left eye due to retinal bleeding. Now I am legally blind in my left eye.  If I have any problems with my right eye, I may not be able to drive in the near future, so I need a college degree to help me find employment in a college Town in food service or a hotel in a city setting. I could then ride the city bus  if I live in my own apartment. I must add there is no funding here for disabled adults through vocational rehabilitation. I cannot receive government grant money for school or past school debts. I must rely on student loans and employment on school campus to pay my way to college.  My credit score and income ration will not allow me to obtain a personal loan to pay this debt off. I' m unable to attend college without this campaign goal being met.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I need $ 5,900.00 to pay past college debt so, my transcripts can be released and my student loan application can be approved. Any money raised above this amount will be placed toward tuition and books, plus college deposits. I will pay for my student housing from my government disability income and part time employment.  Getting my transcripts released will also allow me to transfer 40 hours of college credits that I previously earned, saving me time and money in completing my degree.</li>
<li>For $1.00 to $14.00 you will have my deep appreciation and I will include you in my thoughts and prayers.</li>
<li>For $15.00 to $99.00 you will receive a Signed Thank You Card from me along with a copy of a Picture of a Cross floating in mid air in the sky. This picture is real, the cross was formed by a cloud, and was taken by my friend’s mom during her vacation in Hawaii. It will give you Hope in your Spiritual Quest.</li>
<li>For $100.00 or more donation I will give you a Signed Thank You Card from me, a copy of the  before mentioned Picture of a Cross, and a copy of a local or regional Cook Book from the Southern United States.</li>
<li>For $250.00 or more you can receive a large canvas print of the before mentioned picture of the Cross in the Sky.  Or you can choose the option to have a custom portrait drawing by an artist (while available).  For samples of his work go to <a href=""http://whistler-kenworthy.artistwebsites.com/art/all/portraits/all"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this link</a>.</li>
<li>Any Funding obtained will be used to pay my college debts to obtain my college transcripts.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p> Your help will give me a new lease on my life to encourage others as I overcome my disability to pursue my goal of obtaining a college degree, first at the Associate’s Degree level and later at the Bachelor’s Degree level. Possibly a Master’s Degree if I prove myself worthy. When I had my own automobile I would volunteer during Election Days to help all people to vote their conscience in my county in South Carolina. I was a poll worker who help set up the voting booths with machines. I would answer people’s questions on how to place their personal vote for whoever they wished to win the election of that time. I enjoyed seeing people of this country vote their conscience and heart’  s desire. I miss that time in my life. I have set at home in my bedroom as time passed me by. I now wish to get my college degree and move forward in my life to serve others in my future employment and give service during elections as a member of a local Poll Staff Team.   Also, I don’t mind working and paying my share of taxes when due.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please spread the word about my goal through Indiegogo Tools and word of mouth, and, possibly Facebook Media or other social networks.  Also, if you cannot contribute, please pray for me to meet or exceed my goal and be able to attend college this Fall 2013.  Remember, it will take a miracle to allow me to return to college this Fall 2013.</li>

<div class=""activity-content"">
<p>Our new goal—2%--$3,000</p>
<p>I am feeling so inspired by the support and love I’ve been shown over the past few days. Never did I dream I would meet my original goal (and beyond!) so quickly.</p>
<p>If I can move above and beyond this loan debt it will free me up to give give give!</p>

</div>
<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>My student loan debt total: $105,000</p>
<p>My monthly student loan payment: $800 (Eek!)</p>
<p>Seeking: $1,500 to pay off the total balance of my smallest loan, let’s get that debt-payoff snowball rolling! </p>
<p><em>Update 2/20/13</em>: I am feeling so inspired by the support and love I've been shown over the past few days. Never did I dream I would meet my original goal (and beyond!) so quickly. My original goal of paying off 1% of my student loans has now been increased to 2%. Let's raise $3000 so that I can move above and beyond this loan debt and be free to give give give back! </p>
<h3>The Why</h3>
<p>I want to continue being able to give back to our local/international communities. Humanitarian work is the reason I became an RN. In addition to being an ER nurse I’m a volunteer nurse (I've volunteered for that big RED organization whose symbol is a CROSS…)</p>
<p>Taking time off to volunteer is difficult with a monthly loan payment that high…tack on the cost of living…but I’m determined to keep giving back. Examples of places I’ve done volunteer work: Kenya (Africa), rural Hawaii and post-hurricane New Orleans.</p>
<p>A great example of how my student loan debt is hindering my service to our local/global communities: late last year and early this year my assistance with Hurricane Sandy was requested THREE times. I was so disappointed that I couldn't go volunteer; taking 3+ weeks off of work to go and help just wasn't financially feasible because of my loan debt. You can imagine how frustrating that was!</p>
<h3>The How</h3>
<p>The sooner I can pay my loans, the sooner I can pack my bags to go help those in need. I worked hard to get the education and skills necessary to do the work that I do, I want to utilize it to it's full potential. Paying off 1% is a great place to start!</p>
<p>All donations, big and small, near and far, go directly to paying the balance of my student loans. Thank you!! Please help to spread the word &lt;3</p>

<p><strong>Soft Skills for a Flat World Online Training Project</strong></p>
<p>Soft Skills are the missing link for many young Indians as they prepare for this new flat world - so this project is to bring them elearning in soft skills - at Indian prices.

<p><strong>My name is David Nelson and I live in Raleigh, NC. I am a veteran of the U. S. Army, a Pharmacist and I have been doing martial arts since 1984. In 2004 I published a book about martial arts at my own expense, but it was somewhat of a rough draft. I am currently working on a second edition of the book and my goal is to have a final product that will help a lot of people be more prepared.</strong></p>
<p><strong>With your help I will be able to make a high quality book with a Master Instructor. All money raised will go toward pictures, editing and publishing costs as well as allowing me to donate many copies of the book to young people in Wake County.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have come up with perks that will allow us to spend time with people and directly interact with our supporters. We know time is valuable to everyone, so we will make it as great and informative as we can.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our book is designed to help people make informed decisions about martial arts and to help smaller persons defend themselves against larger attackers. Specifically we want to peak interest and guide people toward local martial arts training across the U. S. so they will be prepared. If you cannot afford classes, the book will give you the tools to prepare yourself (please be gentle with friends and family when you practice on them).</strong></p>
<p><strong>We appreciate any help you can give us on this project. If you can pass this along to anyone you think will benefit from fitness, stretching, nutrition, self-defense and martial arts we will be very grateful.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please check out the perks we are offering, and thank you for your support.</strong></p>

<p>Khari and I are two college students that will be studying abroad in Barcelona, Spain this summer. We decided to make our studying abroad experience a project where we could use some of the tools that we are learning in college to empower students with disabilities.</p>
<p>Studying abroad has always been an aspiration of mine, and when I broke my neck in a diving accident I thought my chances of traveling and studying abroad were over. Nevertheless, my sophomore year in college I decided to aim for the unthinkable and attended a Study Abroad Fair. There I learned that my dream to travel and study abroad is in fact possible. Unfortunately, there just isn’t enough support and motivation for students with disabilities to study abroad. After much planning, Khari and I decided to work together to change this. Through Empower On, we hope to encourage other students with disabilities to follow their dreams and make the unthinkable possible! </p>
<p class=""p1"">We have the incredible opportunity to make a short film about studying abroad with a disability, and develop a program to help students with disabilities study abroad. This will change our lives by helping us learn, grow and reach our goals. However, we also hope to inspire others in our local and global community. With your support we can help empower students with disabilities!</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>            In September, I plan to make the trip from Chicago to London to undertake the Dance Science postgraduate program at Trinity Laban. Always interested in the body, I found recent inspiration from assisting a ballet class for students with cerebral palsy. This introduced me to how I could take my passion for dance to give back to the community. Although the healing process may take longer, the therapeutic and rehabilitative uses of dance dives deeper into the core of the problem. By studying dance science, I would like to research the impact of dance on specific populations beyond the trained dancer. Attending Trinity Laban will help me in this process. Dance does more for the world aside from the creation and performance of art; mind and body both profit from the exploration of this scientific aspect.</p>
<p>Continuing my education in dance science further expands upon my Bachelor of Arts degree in dance. During my four years at Columbia College Chicago, my classes only skimmed the surface of anatomy and kinesiology as it applies to the dancer. Technique classes fostered the discovery of the body’s functionality of movement through somatic exercises. My eclectic training at Columbia introduced me to kinesthetic approaches that stirred a desire to someday study physical therapy. Until recently, dance and science existed as separate entities in my mind. Trinity Laban grants me the best of both worlds, fusing dance and science to create a new path for my passions. Acknowledging other approaches for a healthy body emphasizes the need to support a foundation for a new era of dance and science combined. An education abroad in dance science provides me an opportunity to set this foundation by experiencing a community already embracing this combination.</p>
<p>In my studies, this would be my first step towards developing rehabilitative practice based in dance to support dancers and non-dancers alike. Upon returning from London, I hope to establish a class open to those desiring to work past a lingering injury or any physical limitation, as well as those simply wishing to improve their overall physical health. Working with my students, I plan to use my newly gained knowledge to continue investigating dance’s countless benefits and develop a focused approach to a healthful kinesthetic practice.</p>
<p><em>            </em>A program such as this does not exist in the states. I am at the point in my career where I need to take risks to build myself as a dancer. Sometimes those risks take you places far from home to learn new knowledge and gain invaluable experiences. Trinity Laban would give me an edge upon returning to my community. An edge advancing the field dance science. Going abroad to continue my studies provides me the opportunity to bring over new approaches to alternative forms of medicine that can contribute towards a healthier America. With the next chapter of my life beginning, I wish to not follow the path laid out before me. Instead, I wish to build my path one step at time, never ceasing to learn something new about what can be discovered from this form. To go abroad and study at Trinity Laban, I am more than certain that I can achieve this level. However, I must be realistic financially. I cannot do this alone. Your help is greatly appreciated and gets me one step closer to making my dreams come true. Every penny helps to pay for tuition, books, school supplies, housing and living costs. If you can't donate, please help me to spread the word about my fundraiser. Many thanks to you all!</p>

Always interested in the body, I found recent inspiration from assisting a ballet class for students with cerebral palsy. This introduced me to how I could take my passion for dance to give back to the community. Although the healing process may take longer, the therapeutic and rehabilitative uses of dance dives deeper into the core of the problem. By studying dance science, I would like to research the impact of dance on specific populations beyond the trained dancer. Attending Trinity Laban will help me in this process. Dance does more for the world aside from the creation and performance of art; mind and body both profit from the exploration of this scientific aspect.
Continuing my education in dance science further expands upon my Bachelor of Arts degree in dance. During my four years at Columbia College Chicago, my classes only skimmed the surface of anatomy and kinesiology as it applies to the dancer. Technique classes fostered the discovery of the body’s functionality of movement through somatic exercises. My eclectic training at Columbia introduced me to kinesthetic approaches that stirred a desire to someday study physical therapy. Until recently, dance and science existed as separate entities in my mind. Trinity Laban grants me the best of both worlds, fusing dance and science to create a new path for my passions. Acknowledging other approaches for a healthy body emphasizes the need to support a foundation for a new era of dance and science combined. An education abroad in dance science provides me an opportunity to set this foundation by experiencing a community already embracing this combination.
In my studies, this would be my first step towards developing rehabilitative practice based in dance to support dancers and non-dancers alike. Upon returning from London, I hope to establish a class open to those desiring to work past a lingering injury or any physical limitation, as well as those simply wishing to improve their overall physical health. Working with my students, I plan to use my newly gained knowledge to continue investigating dance’s countless benefits and develop a focused approach to a healthful kinesthetic practice.
            A program such as this does not exist in the states. I am at the point in my career where I need to take risks to build myself as a dancer. Sometimes those risks take you places far from home to learn new knowledge and gain invaluable experiences. Trinity Laban would give me an edge upon returning to my community. An edge advancing the field dance science. Going abroad to continue my studies provides me the opportunity to bring over new approaches to alternative forms of medicine that can contribute towards a healthier America. With the next chapter of my life beginning, I wish to not follow the path laid out before me. Instead, I wish to build my path one step at time, never ceasing to learn something new about what can be discovered from this form. To go abroad and study at Trinity Laban, I am more than certain that I can achieve this level. However, I must be realistic financially. I cannot do this alone. Your help is greatly appreciated and gets me one step closer to making my dreams come true. Every penny helps to pay for tuition, books, school supplies, housing and living costs. If you can't donate, please help me to spread the word about my fundraiser. Many thanks to you all!

<p><strong><span>Who We Are</span></strong>:</p>
<p>Skate 4 Homies was founded in 2010. Our mission is to support, preserve and promote skateboarding as a healthy sport, culture and lifestyle for disadvantaged youth.  Skate 4 Homies provides new and refurbished skateboarding equipment, helmets and clothing, as well as educational and art programs to youth in financially challenged households. </p>
<p><strong><span>What We Do</span></strong>:</p>
<p>In 2011, we provided skateboarding equipment and educational classes to over 400 local youth. With our support and the positive environment we provide, we help youth build confidence through skateboarding. That same confidence breeds success that translates to other areas of their lives and community. </p>
<p>Skate 4 Homies is more than just skateboarding. This year we are expanding our educational program to include lessons in the following:</p>
<p>- Art</p>
<p>- Homework Class</p>
<p>- Health &amp; Nutrition</p>
<p>- Math/Science</p>
<p>- Construction/Maintenance </p>
<p>- Fiscal Responsibliity</p>
<p>- Community Service </p>
<p>With our youthful approach, these diverse classes help keep kids interested in learning. When students are inspired they will stay in school longer, go on to receive a higher education, and in the end will be better equipped to positively contribute to our community.</p>
<p>Our kids are required to participate in community service projects during the year. For example, last year we cleaned up miles of trash along the Jordan River Parkway and raised over 1,500 pounds of food for the Utah Food Bank. Through community service and mentoring, our kids will continue giving back to their community even after they graduate from our program.</p>
<p><strong><span>Our Facility:</span></strong></p>
<p>As with any sport, skateboarding can be dangerous if not done right. That’s why we have a private facility off the corner of 700 South and 300 West, where we train the kids in our program. We are able to build features that meet their skill level. We provide one-on-one training and coaching in a controlled environment. We make sure the kids are wearing the proper attire and using proper equipment.</p>
<p>We cannot provide this level of educational programming without the support of people and companies like you. </p></div>","Cash Match Opportunity:

Our Facility:
As with any sport, skateboarding can be dangerous if not done right. That’s why we have a private facility off the corner of 700 South and 300 West, where we train the kids in our program. We are able to build features that meet their skill level. We provide one-on-one training and coaching in a controlled environment. We make sure the kids are wearing the proper attire and using proper equipment.
We cannot provide this level of educational programming without the support of people and companies like you.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2>What We Need &amp; Why <br/>(The Academia Hump to Get Over)</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>While we believe that improving bedside manner is a necessary part of medical education this course is not mandatory and therefore not funded by the university. Our hope is that by documenting the the positive changes that this course will be implemented as a part of mandatory core curriculum, and will be funded. Until then we need outside support to be able to offer this valuable and long lasting training available to young doctors who are embarking on their medical career.  In April 2012 Spring Reins of Hope partnered with UMDNJ and offered the course free of charge in order to gauge the interest / feedback / and engagement.   After completing the course, both students and administrators from UMDNJ applauded the impact that the horses had on students in the way of experiential learning and illustrating just how subtle body language can be to allow a patient to feel Safe - or - UN-safe. UMDNJ is exploring the viability around establishing this elective course into mandatory training required by M3 and M4 medical students to complete their training (maybe even eventually dental students, nurses, med techs, etc).</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><em>*To read student evaluations from the pilot April 2012 course - see the pdf file ""Student Evals 2012"" loaded in the GALLERY tab of this campaign.</em></p>
<p>However, this is a new modality (especially to the North-east USA) and getting a new class to be approved and also funded within academia is a large chore. There will need to be more proof! SROH would like to continue offering this course to young doctors in order to help ensure that future patients will meet up with trust and safety within their own healthcare provider network, right off the bat.  We believe that when a patient feels safe and secure (trusts) their health care provider and the decisions he/she makes on their behalf that there is an improved rapport right from the start. This trust and rapport will translate into the treatment plan, increased optimism, higher efforts to follow instructions, and possibly lower Mal-practice claims.</p>
<p>Each Mondays full day session has real costs associated with it running at approximately $1100 for each day. 2-3 facilitators, 4-8 horses, ring fees, facility fees, catering, insurance, etc. all adds up. Two full days at 1100 = $2,200. Indiegogo charges fees for this campaign fund-raising option.  If the entire goal is not met, SROH has agreed to run the course on whatever amount is raised applied to April 2013 class. We are hoping it will not end up costing the equine program money to provide this service. If the amount raised exceeds the total needed, any excess funds will be applied to the costs of the next Horses For Healers session (either Fall 2013 or Spring 2014).</p>

<h2><strong>The Impact (Why Does This Training Matter?)<br/></strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<div>
<p><span class=""fbPhotoCaptionText"">The <em>Horses for Healers</em> workshop is an EAL (equine assisted learning) program that allows Medical Professionals (and students) to learn body language awareness and improve upon bedside manner. Horses are extremely sensitive to body language / intent vs. action which makes them superb barometers to gauge and to mirror back the congruency of our body language signals. Over time our big picture goal is to create a positive impact for medical professionals to have fantastic bedside manner, creating a different patient experience, relationship and rapport with their health care providers. Our short term goal is to provide 10-12 medical students in New Jersey with these skills to take with them into their practice and career right from the beginning. So in essence we believe that by funding and providing this one class - it will make a difference to the patients that these soon to be doctors will face in their practice. Its a start!<br/></span></p>

<p>The <em>Horse Medicine Wheel/Horses for Healers</em> is a workshop specifically designed for healthcare professionals such as; doctors, dentists, nurses and clinical health science students, house staff, or other healthcare professionals--anyone with direct patient care responsibility. Because health science education stresses intellectual excellence, much less attention is placed on proficient communication, both verbal and non-verbal. Good communication can help increase patient satisfaction, therapeutic outcomes, and malpractice prevention to name a few [Stanford Medicine &amp; Horsemanship, Kane, 2007].<sup>3</sup></p>

<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""> </p>
<p>Learning to communicate with horses requires an appreciation for all the messages we send and receive as it demands patience, gentleness, self-confidence, sensitivity, focus and a keen awareness. Horses are large but also easily frightened - their survival as prey animals depends upon them being finely tuned to body language, emotional tone and to the position or movement of objects and other beings within their sensory fields. Through this work, medical professionals are able to increase their sensitivity to non-verbal awareness and communication as they explore the poise and self control to interact with a 1000 lb being, their ability to monitor and read the body language of their human patients becomes more refined.</p>
<p>By reflecting back to us the most subtle signals of our intent (that we may not be conscious of) the horses can teach us to be much more aware of the messages that we convey. Horses also can help us refine our instinctual, intuitive and sensory faculties that may have dulled due to pressure of exams/schooling, scientific reasoning, logical diagnosis, and clinical decision making. Horses can challenge us to overcome our fears/indecision and develop confidence, courage and conviction.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Horses also help medical professionals in that they remain true to their essence - they each have distinct personalities and moods - an approach that works with one horse may not work with another (much like human patients), we therefore have to find other ways to communicate, and generate respect within that relationship in order for it to be based on compassion and trust. Because horses react to the subtlest of our human signals, it is as if they are holding up a magnifying glass to our styles and behaviors. It is in this mirror that we can see our truest image and a path to professional development and growth.</p>

The University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) with Robert Wood Johnson Medical School is offering an elective course for medical students, residents and other health professionals.  In conjunction with Spring Reins of Hope (SROH) - an EAGALA model program in NJ - we have created a course, The Horse Medicine Wheel / Horses for Healers whereupon medical professionals / students learn impeccable bedside manner from horses! 
 
""Horses for Healers"" is being offered for the second time as an elective in Spring 2013 through UMDNJ at the SROH location in central NJ.  The class is a 2 week elective where upon two consecutive Mondays are full days spent at the farm with the horses (consisting of a mixture of short classroom lectures and the majority of day spent in the arena/paddock with horses). The following Tues-Fri segment of the course is held on the UMDNJ campus with lecture, lab, shadowing rounds and other classes pertaining to bedside manner within the university setting. 
 
This EAL workshop is a new modality and approach, but with very promising results and reactions. See our additional files posted on this campaign where you can read the student evaluations from the first pilot class in April 2012 (PDF in the GALLERY tab of this campaign). The majority response was that this class should be mandatory to graduate medical school! As more students demonstrate similar responses/reactions and results, the closer this will become an accepted model at the interface of basic science and clinical training.  In order to run more courses for more students there needs to be support in paying the costs of the EAL component (insurance, facilitators, horses, facility, etc).  UMDNJ and SROH are seeking support from the community to as a way to cover the cost of this course.For more information there is also a podcast available and picture slideshow at: http://seen-heard.com/blog/?p=1238 
 
 

 
 
What We Need & Why (The Academia Hump to Get Over)
 
While we believe that improving bedside manner is a necessary part of medical education this course is not mandatory and therefore not funded by the university. Our hope is that by documenting the the positive changes that this course will be implemented as a part of mandatory core curriculum, and will be funded. Until then we need outside support to be able to offer this valuable and long lasting training available to young doctors who are embarking on their medical career.  In April 2012 Spring Reins of Hope partnered with UMDNJ and offered the course free of charge in order to gauge the interest / feedback / and engagement.   After completing the course, both students and administrators from UMDNJ applauded the impact that the horses had on students in the way of experiential learning and illustrating just how subtle body language can be to allow a patient to feel Safe - or - UN-safe. UMDNJ is exploring the viability around establishing this elective course into mandatory training required by M3 and M4 medical students to complete their training (maybe even eventually dental students, nurses, med techs, etc).
*To read student evaluations from the pilot April 2012 course - see the pdf file ""Student Evals 2012"" loaded in the GALLERY tab of this campaign.
However, this is a new modality (especially to the North-east USA) and getting a new class to be approved and also funded within academia is a large chore. There will need to be more proof! SROH would like to continue offering this course to young doctors in order to help ensure that future patients will meet up with trust and safety within their own healthcare provider network, right off the bat.  We believe that when a patient feels safe and secure (trusts) their health care provider and the decisions he/she makes on their behalf that there is an improved rapport right from the start. This trust and rapport will translate into the treatment plan, increased optimism, higher efforts to follow instructions, and possibly lower Mal-practice claims.
Each Mondays full day session has real costs associated with it running at approximately $1100 for each day. 2-3 facilitators, 4-8 horses, ring fees, facility fees, catering, insurance, etc. all adds up. Two full days at 1100 = $2,200. Indiegogo charges fees for this campaign fund-raising option.  If the entire goal is not met, SROH has agreed to run the course on whatever amount is raised applied to April 2013 class. We are hoping it will not end up costing the equine program money to provide this service. If the amount raised exceeds the total needed, any excess funds will be applied to the costs of the next Horses For Healers session (either Fall 2013 or Spring 2014).

<p>Thank you all for you generosity and support.</p>
<p>The February JEP ""Apprentice Challenge"" is now fully funded and with time to spare.  So not to waste this wonderful opportunity we are going to keep fundraising and use any amount over the initial goal to fund the next stage of Young Entrepreneurs of Paraguay, our national business plan competition.</p>

<p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong>:</p>
<p>Paraguay is a developing country with over half of the current population under the age of 25. A recent publication from the United Nations Development Programme reported that there is a 70% unemployment rate amongst Paraguayan youth ages 15 to 29. Additionally, there are only 8,000 job opportunities for the 40,000 youth that are entering the labor market every year. Youth face limited academic opportunities and lack available technical training in their communities.</p>

<p><strong>THE OPPORTUNITY:</strong></p>
<p>Many Paraguayan youth are eager to change their lives, but they lack guidance and the tools to develop their entrepreneurial spirit. Paraguay’s biggest resource is its people, and youth make up the largest percentage. They can move Paraguay forward by addressing needs in their communities through entrepreneurship. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE WANT TO DO:</strong></p>
<p>Youth Entrepreneurs of Paraguay (JEP) and Young Entrepreneurs Association of Paraguay (AJE Paraguay) are hosting a nationwide business plan competition in July 2013. The participants, from all over Paraguay, will have participated a 4-month ""Build Your Dreams"" business course and created viable business plans that address needs in their communities. Each community will select the best business plan and bring their youth to compete in a national competition to win over $1,000 in seed funding to start their own business, enabling them to make their venture a reality. </p>

<p><strong>SUCCESSES:</strong></p>
<p>Now in its second year, the JEP initiative has already helped many Paraguayans become entrepreneurs. Last year’s competition resulted in over 30 business plans and 10 start-ups created all over the country.

The February JEP ""Apprentice Challenge"" is now fully funded and with time to spare.  So not to waste this wonderful opportunity we are going to keep fundraising and use any amount over the initial goal to fund the next stage of Young Entrepreneurs of Paraguay, our national business plan competition.
Come July, graduates of the ""Build your Dreams"" business course will be submitting business plans to be considered for seed funding from Young Entrepeneurs of Paraguay in order to make these businesses happen.  The entrepreneurs present their plans to a panel of Paraguayan business leaders during another three day event.

<p><strong>A CALL TO ARMS</strong></p>
<p>In July 2008, after laying a friend to rest that was killed in action while conducting combat operations in support of Operation IRAQ FREEDOM, I was discussing with a mutual friend about various programs available to the families of service members that were wounded or killed in action (WIA/KIA).  It was during this conversation that his mother innocently offered the statement “Well I always thought you all took care of your own!”  For the past few years the loss of that friend and many more since, along with that statement have remained in the forefront of my days.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that as service members we know the risks involved with our occupation of arms and since 2001 we have knowingly and willingly placed ourselves in harms way on behalf of our country - like generations of service members before us.  While deployed we often times establish tighter bonds with people in our units then we have with the families that raised us; through shared adversity we persevere. </p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Defense reports as of October 12, 2012 there were 3, 479 KIA and 31,930 WIA in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM and 1,672 KIA and 17,737 WIA in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. </p>
<p>Currently the US military stands just shy of 3 million service members (active/reserves) but these numbers do not take into account the countless veterans of previous wars or service members that have transitioned back into civilian roles. We have shown in wars throughout our nations history what we can do when we put our minds to it, so what would happen if we came together now?</p>
<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU HELP</strong></p>
<p>I am going to speak blasphemy for a moment and ask service members past, present, and future to forgo their daily “Cup of Joe” and donate whatever that amount is to Fallen Not Forgotten, Inc. – ONLY FOR 1 DAY!  I know that coffee is the staple ingredient that has powered the military throughout the years and that the military may grind to a halt so I am not asking for everyone to do it on the same day…and on behalf of all the junior service members definitely not on a Monday!  You pick the day and it only has to be one cup! (We are not trying to cost anyone his or her jobs here.)</p>
<p>Never served in the military, but still want to help?  If you are up for the challenge and think that you can handle the start to the day without caffeine….by all means join us!  We would love your continued support!</p>
<p>If you can’t afford a financial contribution there are other ways you can help.  For example simply getting the word out via social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus or any other way that people may connect with us is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p><strong>TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN</strong></p>
<p>The College Board Advocacy &amp; Policy Center states that the average estimated undergraduate budget for public four-year in-state on-campus students is $21,447, including tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, transportation, and other expenses as of 2011-2012.  If we were able to get EVERY active/reserve member to donate $1 (the price of a Cup of Joe from McDonald’s) we could send 139 wounded or fallen service members children to college at no out-of-pocket expense to them at today’s cost.  Imagine how amazing that would be!  As an organization, we are realists and have set the goal low initially to manage expectations – we welcome our expectations being surpassed and challenge everyone that visits this site to help us in doing so!</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE PERKS</strong> (because you’ll need a pick me up after not having your daily Cup of Joe)</p>
<p>On the right sidebar of this page you’ll see that we’ve created a few “perks” to help you determine what level of contribution you’d like to make.  Please note that you do not have to claim a perk in order to contribute.  Just click the “contribute now” button below and follow the instructions.  If you’d like to claim a perk, please do and share that experience with your friends.</p>
<p> Like the selfless service to your country, the biggest reward is internal pride of knowing that you have not forgotten the sacrifices of our fallen WIA/KIA and the ongoing struggles of their families as they continue on.</p>
<p> <strong>SPECIAL NOTE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF FALLEN NOT FORGOTTEN, INC:</strong></p>
<p>I am an active duty service member that has not forgotten.  I, like many of you, have experienced the loss of many friends throughout the past eleven years and know in my heart that these are not “someone else’s kids” …these are now our sons and daughters and they deserve our help to ensure they are well taken care of.  We must take care of our own!</p>

With the funds that we receive, we will release 2 books in French, 2 in Spanish; and 1 book promoting global awareness and community. We will also attend local and regional expos to promote our mission and our message.



 
What We Need & What You Get

We are seeking to raise $5000. Each book costs about $800 including pre-print editing, set up costs, and final printing. Therefore, printing 5 books (2 Spanish, 2 French, 1 English) will require a total cost of $4000. The remaining $1000 will be used to help defray our costs in upcoming expos and events where we will promote our mission and message.
 
Our perks for our donors will be first edition and signed copies of our new books and T-shirts that promote the mission of the company. Our books include ""Hola Pedro"" and ""Bonjour Pierre"". These teach children the basics of Spanish and French conversation; and these do include a vocabulary/pronunciation key for parents. Our third book is ""Little Champion"" which empowers children to change their local and global communities. 
 
For T shirts, we have a children's ""Peace"" T-shirt that features the penguin from our books. He is standing in front of a globe with 'peace' written in multiple languages (look at our thumbnail to get an idea of what it will look like). For the adults, we have a light blue T-shirt that says ""Peace Begins with Understanding"" in front of a globe.
 Other Ways You Can Help!


 
Please help us! Friend us on Facebook, Twitter, send all family and friends a link to this page. At All Learners, we firmly believe in our goal and mission. Any funds we raise will be used to help spread learning and hopefully greater peace and understanding.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

am expected to attend at least two professional conferences in 2014. At these
conferences we present research projects we have been working on for the past
year, attend informational workshops, round table discussions and network with
other psychology programs. Attending is a great way to make contacts for future
research and to look into doctoral programs we may want to enroll in after
graduation from our current program.</p>
<p>  Last
year our undergraduate Educational Psychology research group presented at the
Southwestern Psychological Association (SWPA) regional conference in Fort
Worth, Texas. We were able to present five projects we had just finished. This
was an exciting and educational experience that helped solidify my choice of
Experimental Psychology as a career. </p>
<p>This year we plan on
attending SWPA again, in San Antonio, Texas, as well as, the Association for
Psychological Science (APS) national conference in San Francisco, California.
Our main obstacle this year is funding. Unfortunately, our department can only
reimburse us for $100-$200 per person for travel expenses. We estimate our
total expense to be $2,500 per person this year. This includes all of our
transportation, hotel and food costs. </p>
<p>  As
a group we are planning several fundraising projects throughout the year to
reach our goal such as, a small organizational grant, a garage sale and
possibly a bake sale. I am also pursuing a few other opportunities to raise
funds on my own (this website) and with a graduate psychology club (a t-shirt
fundraiser, and Amazon partnership). I have also applied to be a volunteer for
the APS conference. The volunteer position will reimburse up to $300 in hotel
costs if I am accepted. </p>
<p>  My
research interests include improving academic success and influences on student
motivation; this can be clearly seen in all of my projects this year. They
include:</p>
<p><b><i>Underprepared
Undergraduates</i></b>- An intervention to assist undergraduates
in learning study skills appropriate to the demands of collegiate coursework with
an emphasis on increasing their overall academic motivation.</p>
<p><b><i>Religiosity, Stress and
Academic Motivation</i></b>- A survey of undergraduate
students, evaluating their use of religious resources as a form of social
support, increasing their academic motivation.</p>
<p><b><i>Student Writing Anxiety
and Motivation</i></b>- Evaluation of undergraduate beliefs
about basic writing and anxiety toward academic writing styles. A pilot study
to assist in designing an intervention.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need </h3><p></p><table><tbody>

The courts also found overwhelming evidence that the government acted in bad faith, hoping to gain political advantage rather than considering the educational needs of our children.These are not people making politician kind of money. They are everyday folks.

The intention of the design was to make a functional learning environment that would respond to the climate and the culture while minimizing the material cost. In order to accomplish this, our team had to employ innovative, yet simple construction methods.

The remaining $16,625 goes towards paying the few local skilled laborers and staff on the ground in Burkina Faso in addition to other overhead costs, such as material transportation.The school is built by the local villagers who will be utilizing the school. Every member of the community signs (or fingerprints) a covenant, that is a solemn promise outlining the community member's responsibilities for the project. The village provides the land, local materials, and unskilled labor. The village also promises to send boys and girls to school in equal numbers (something that is often not the case in developing countries). 
  
The Impact IS BIGGER!  




Humanitarian architecture is architecture that uses the natural and built environment to improve the welfare and livelihood of its inhabitants. Within humanitarian architecture sustainable designs play a significant role in positively impacting the community, economy, and environment. By promoting the positive impact of humanitarian architecture, more university students and professionals in the field of architecture and design are able to participate in these types of life-changing projects.

<p>We are a small,
inspired-by-Waldorf school for children ages 3-6.  In response to the
needs of our small community for holistic, developmentally appropriate
schooling, we opened our school 3.5 years ago. </p>
<p>We have experienced great success and have built quite a wonderful community of families and friends.</p>
<p>One aspect for us that has been

additional fundraising.  This year an amazing training opportunity,
Lifeways Early Childhood Certification, is coming to our area.  This
training has been on our radar for many years but has been located too far away
to make attendance realistic.  This year it is coming to our town! 
We hope to raise enough money to send at least one teacher through this certification
program.  </p>
<p><br/><b>Who we are:</b></p>
<p>The Little
Round Schoolhouse is a home-based program inspired-by-Waldorf for children 3-6
years old.  We are devoted to providing a quality program that meets the
physical, social-emotional, mental, and spiritual needs of young
children.  We recognize and value the magic of early childhood and want to
create a space that honors and nurtures our young children.<br/>
 <br/>
We draw a great amount of inspiration from the Waldorf model of early childhood
education, which doesn’t include any formal academics but sets the foundation
for academic learning later in life.  We believe that play is the true
work of childhood and that learning by doing provides a framework for problem
solving and critical thinking, as well as a love for lifelong learning.<br/>
 <br/>
We surround our children with simple, natural toys and experiences.  We
let the children do things directly for themselves, trusting in their natural
development and growth.<br/>
 <br/>
Each day begins with circle time, where children will enjoy songs, movements,
verses, and finger plays that recognize and celebrate the cycles of the natural
world.  Story time is also an important aspect of our daily rhythm and
children will use stories to engage in drama and puppetry.<br/>
 <br/>
Children are served natural, nutritious snacks (made with their help!). 
They enjoy a daily rhythm of activities including free indoor and outdoor play,
nature walks, watercolor painting, baking, beeswax modeling, gardening,
handwork and sewing, and seasonal crafts.  </p><p><br/><b>What We Need:</b></p>

In Pakistan there are over three million girls not in school, and <b>almost half</b> (49%) of the girls who <i>do</i> begin primary school leave before completing the final grade. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is especially troubling, as by 2050, Pakistan will have the <b>4th largest</b> population in the world behind, China, India and the USA. Yet Pakistan only spends <b>2.7%</b> of its annual GDP on education, spending seven-times that on defense. The effects of such a poor education system are evident. Pakistan’s total literacy rate is a dismal <b>50%</b>, while <b>only 36%</b> of Pakistani women are literate. </p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/592326/files/20140520103535-sonia-shah-foundation-8.jpg?1400607335"" src="""" style=""""/><p><br/></p><p>Literacy translates directly to success in the workforce.  Women with a secondary education earn <b>70%</b> of what men earn; with a primary education, they earn <b>51%</b> of what men earn.   Illiterate women with no completed education earn even less.  Yet perhaps most astounding of all, women with a high level of literacy <b>earn <i>95% more</i></b> than women who are illiterate. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sonia Shah made it her mission, despite her young age, to change the lives of thousands of girls in Kangra, Pakistan by building a girls’ school herself and providing desperately needed education.  Yet Sonia's story was tragically cut short before she could see the opening of the school.</p>
<p>
</p><h4>Sonia's Story</h4>
<p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/592314/files/20140520103210-zo2u2677.jpg?1400607130"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Sonia was an exceptional girl. She spoke five languages, was the youngest intern in the President's Campaign of 2012, and kept the needs of others above her own. She completed her education a year early and at only 17 years old, she dedicated a gap year to go to Kangra, Pakistan and build a school for the girls of the village. <p></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sonia was determined that she would get to know the women of Kangra, understand their needs and then do what it takes to help improve their lives.  Sonia created a non-profit foundation to accomplish her task, and, in typical Sonia fashion, the foundation was in the name of her beloved grandmother, the Kulsoom Foundation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Speaking 5 languages herself, she planned a bilingual school for girls with a curriculum that would be taught in Urdu and in English.  She procured the land, gathered the necessary donations, established the curriculum, began the search for the teachers, and oversaw the groundbreaking of the building.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/592317/files/20140520103325-1175399_241861655962625_1523718411_n.jpg?1400607205"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>For a girl born and raised in the United States and Europe to go live in a rural Pakistani village, amongst the village women, and observe and respect the conservative social norms – takes courage, resolve and a heart of gold. These attributes are the spirit of Sonia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then just as her dreams for the school were about to take flight, her young life was tragically cut short. Usually, when a person passes away at this young an age, people speculate on what this person would have achieved if they had lived for a longer time.  However, in the case of Sonia, we find ourselves wondering how this unusual girl was able to achieve so much and impact so many in her all too brief eighteen years of life. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sonia’s mother, a woman whom she revered for her ambition, intelligence, and heart, carries on the efforts in Pakistan, fulfilling Sonia’s dream as her legacy. Sonia’s story and dreams for girls in Pakistan have inspired so many to give their time and resources to help make this dream a reality.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This campaign is for those set-up expenses of the school. The total amount we are trying to raise is $17,000 for the following expenses: </p>
<ul>
<li>Furniture, including desks, chairs, fans, white boards, tables and other essentials</li>
<li>Computer Lab, including computers, printers, and equipment for video-aided teaching</li>

Literacy translates directly to success in the workforce.  Women with a secondary education earn 70% of what men earn; with a primary education, they earn 51% of what men earn.   Illiterate women with no completed education earn even less.  Yet perhaps most astounding of all, women with a high level of literacy earn 95% more than women who are illiterate. 

Sonia Shah made it her mission, despite her young age, to change the lives of thousands of girls in Kangra, Pakistan by building a girls’ school herself and providing desperately needed education.  Yet Sonia's story was tragically cut short before she could see the opening of the school.

Sonia's Story

Sonia was an exceptional girl. She spoke five languages, was the youngest intern in the President's Campaign of 2012, and kept the needs of others above her own. She completed her education a year early and at only 17 years old, she dedicated a gap year to go to Kangra, Pakistan and build a school for the girls of the village. 

Sonia was determined that she would get to know the women of Kangra, understand their needs and then do what it takes to help improve their lives.  Sonia created a non-profit foundation to accomplish her task, and, in typical Sonia fashion, the foundation was in the name of her beloved grandmother, the Kulsoom Foundation. 

Speaking 5 languages herself, she planned a bilingual school for girls with a curriculum that would be taught in Urdu and in English.  She procured the land, gathered the necessary donations, established the curriculum, began the search for the teachers, and oversaw the groundbreaking of the building.

For a girl born and raised in the United States and Europe to go live in a rural Pakistani village, amongst the village women, and observe and respect the conservative social norms – takes courage, resolve and a heart of gold. These attributes are the spirit of Sonia.

And then just as her dreams for the school were about to take flight, her young life was tragically cut short. Usually, when a person passes away at this young an age, people speculate on what this person would have achieved if they had lived for a longer time.  However, in the case of Sonia, we find ourselves wondering how this unusual girl was able to achieve so much and impact so many in her all too brief eighteen years of life. 

Sonia’s mother, a woman whom she revered for her ambition, intelligence, and heart, carries on the efforts in Pakistan, fulfilling Sonia’s dream as her legacy. Sonia’s story and dreams for girls in Pakistan have inspired so many to give their time and resources to help make this dream a reality.
The School's Status
In 2013 we raised funds to build the school building, and we are excited that building will be completed in June.  We open the Sonia Shah Memorial School to the first class in September, but before we can do that, we have to raise money to fill the school with so many necessary items, including desks, computers, books, tables, and more.  

This campaign is for those set-up expenses of the school. The total amount we are trying to raise is $17,000 for the following expenses: 

Furniture, including desks, chairs, fans, white boards, tables and other essentials
Computer Lab, including computers, printers, and equipment for video-aided teaching
Library, including bookshelves, books, chairs, and desks
Play Room and Swings
Educational Games for Kindergarten students
How You Can Help
Your contributions will directly help launch a desperately needed school for girls in Kangra, Pakistan. Help us fulfill Sonia's dream of a girls’ school in her ancestral village which will, in turn, help fulfill a thousand dreams. Every dollar that you contribute goes directly towards the set-up expenses of the school, and every donation is vital to the success of the Sonia Shah Memorial School. Together we can  provide education for girls in Kangra, Pakistan and change their lives, and the lives of their children, forever.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/>I’m Rob Wilson; I’m the author of the humorous children’s novel, <i><b>The Annoying Ghost Kid</b></i>. It’s about a boy and a girl who are bullied by a ghost. Most bullies must wait until there are no adults around before they can attack. The ghost-bully, however, has the power of invisibility which enables him to attack his victims in the classroom - right under the teacher’s nose! The kids have no one to turn to, so they have to figure out how to deal with the bully on their own.<br/><br/>As the author of <i><b>The Annoying Ghost Kid</b></i>, I am invited into many schools to make an “Author Visit.” As part of my presentation I talk about bullies and how to deal with them. I show the kids two <i>easy-to-remember</i> and <i>simple-to-use</i> techniques for fending off verbal and physical attacks. These techniques not only stop the bullies, but they begin the process of building self-esteem and self-confidence in the victims. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/761876/files/20140802151108-CheathamHill2.JPG?1407017468"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><br/>(NOTE: on the scale of fees from other authors who visit schools, I

Part of my motivation in running this campaign is to create awareness of my program so that I can take it to more schools, and help more kids. Please tell your local school about it. Or send me their contact information (email is best), and I will reach out to them.<br/><br/>Most schools have a “No Bullying” policy. Some schools even offer an Anti-Bullying program. The problem with most of these policies and programs is that they do not teach kids how to stand up to a bully. They teach victims to avoid bullies and to tattle on them. Realistically this only perpetuates the problem. <br/><p></p>

The typical Anti-Bullying program tries to teach kids not to be bullies.
 While I applaud these efforts they will always fall short because it is
 the victim who needs to learn not to be a victim. I’m not saying that 
the victim is to blame, but simply that bullies do not pick on strong 
confident people. They don’t attack the strong and confident because the
 bully himself feels weak and insecure. It is the attacking of someone 
weak and defenseless that makes the bully feel powerful. I have written 
extensively about bullying for <i><b>Psychology Today</b></i>, please see this

 goal is to give potential victims the mental tools they need to halt a 
bully attack in its tracks. My techniques are <i>simple-to-use</i> and 
<i>easy-to-remember</i>, so that when a bully attacks, the victim will not 
panic and will be able to resolve it peacefully. <br/><br/>To date, I have

<p style="""">The Kheprw Institute (KI) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization established in 2004. We strive to provide experiences and opportunities for youth and adults to bring forth the best within themselves, to constantly development and enhance their abilities, to take responsibility for their own transformation and to make positive contributions to their community. We do this by focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Education-</b>  With a focus on African American males, we mentor and educate youth, teaching entrepreneurship, science and technology.</li>
<li>
<b>Empowerment-</b> Youth gain critical thinking and public speaking skills by researching and presenting at monthly public forums on topics which have included: Ferguson, climate change, education, and more.</li>
<li>
<b>Environment and Economy- </b>Youth learn about both sustainability and entrepreneurship through our urban agriculture projects and businesses including the Urban Agriculture Science Lab, KI Compost, Express Yourself Rain Barrels and KI Aquaponics.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Challenges</h3>
<p>On a daily basis young black men's lives are in danger. We do not have THE answer to changing such a huge societal problem. Our focus is to make an impact on the lives of the youth in our program and trust them to create a better future. </p>

<h3>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; font-weight: normal;"">My name is Shannon Todd and I have been involved with Ainembabazi Children's Project since 2008 when I interned in Uganda. I fell in love with the country, our community members and our mission.</span><br/>
</h3>
<div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; font-weight: normal;"">I am raising money to help support our current livestock and agricultural programming. This programming is essential because it helps out community members become self-sustaining and improve their quality of life. </span></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I am asking 150 people to donate $10 each to provide experts in the livestock and agricultural fields to train 150 of our community members. Your $10 will go directly to educating one of our community members.  </p>
<p>For your donation you will receive a charitable receipt. If I reach my goal of funding this project by Sept. 6, I am challenging myself to kayak the North Saskatchewan from Drayton Vally to Devon with Renee Vaugeois, our President. As many of you know I am not really a 'water sports' person so this will be a major challenge for me! It will test us physically and mentally. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>By bringing in experts in the fields of agriculture and livestock rearing to teach our community members we hope they will have increased yields and improved/maintained livestock health. </p>
<p>Some recent successes of our programming: </p>
<p>- Kinoni community garden harvested 80kg of beans. They sold 50kg for profit and kept 30kg to plant in the next season. </p>
<p>- Families in all communities that were given livestock have passed on the offspring livestock to the next families in line. </p>

</div></div>","Who am I and What am I doing?!

My name is Shannon Todd and I have been involved with Ainembabazi Children's Project since 2008 when I interned in Uganda. I fell in love with the country, our community members and our mission.

I am raising money to help support our current livestock and agricultural programming. This programming is essential because it helps out community members become self-sustaining and improve their quality of life.    What We Need & What You Get I am asking 150 people to donate $10 each to provide experts in the livestock and agricultural fields to train 150 of our community members. Your $10 will go directly to educating one of our community members.  
For your donation you will receive a charitable receipt. If I reach my goal of funding this project by Sept. 6, I am challenging myself to kayak the North Saskatchewan from Drayton Vally to Devon with Renee Vaugeois, our President. As many of you know I am not really a 'water sports' person so this will be a major challenge for me! It will test us physically and mentally. 

  The Impact By bringing in experts in the fields of agriculture and livestock rearing to teach our community members we hope they will have increased yields and improved/maintained livestock health. 
Some recent successes of our programming: 
- Kinoni community garden harvested 80kg of beans. They sold 50kg for profit and kept 30kg to plant in the next season. 
- Families in all communities that were given livestock have passed on the offspring livestock to the next families in line. 
- Kitwe community garden harvested 2 sacks of ground nuts (similar to peanuts) and 1 basin of peas. 
  Risks & Challenges Quite frankly I'm totally scared of rivers and water sports. So I suppose the risk is that I'll have a really hard time on the river!

<p><b>Codie</b> is a new robotic toy that teaches the principles of computer coding, with the mission to help understand how technology works. Codie comes with a unique visual programming language, which organizes the code of robotics into blocks. By arranging these blocks together you create real programs, which are then executed by the toy robot. While playing with Codie, you get to learn about how computers think and get to know the fundamental programming concepts in a fun and playful way.</p>

<h3>Our children need to understand how technology works</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Teaching children coding will be useful for the rest of their lives. Learning programming with Codie develops kids' problem solving and critical thinking skills while unleashing their inner creativity. Kids become makers while building their programs with our intuitive application, as creative and colorful as the children using it. We created Codie to provide our youngest and brightest generation the tool they need to acquire the basics of coding.</p>

<br/>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We created our own programming language to teach kids coding, our application bridges the gap between kids’ imagination and the algorithmic thinking. It’s made possible by using the colorful blocks, and connecting them together with arrows showing the direction of execution. Children can learn the basics of coding using real programming patterns, like if-else structures, variables or loops.</p>

<br/>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The benefits of the touchscreen enables us to create a truly intuitive user interface, and avoiding the need for a keyboard. Every control is designed to be as easy to use as possible. We created plenty of custom controls to give more meaning to numeric parameters.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Separated data flow</h3>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1104900/files/20141218061758-5_pic_app.png?1418912278"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To avoid large programs become a confusing mess, we used a new approach: separated data operations. They also look similar to the action blocks, the difference is that the arrows now transfer data between the blocks. Every action block can have it’s data flow, and depend on different calculations for the parameters.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The groundbreaking novelty of the Codie programming language lies in its layered structure. The application gradually introduces different programming concepts, and as kids get to know these more and more complex structures, so do they unlock more possibilities within Codie. Codie grows with you child as they will have new features to explore for a long time.</p>

<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Codie is not just toy, but rather a creative tool, a companion that augments other games. It’s a high-quality learning experience that is fun and provides your kids invaluable skills along the way. With Codie the whole process feels natural and seamless and children get empowered by the knowledge they gain.  It integrates into any game and enables meaningful interactions between kids and real life.</p>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Codie goes way beyond than teaching coding to children. In our interpretation, coding is the understanding of how to use technology flexibly. The ultimate goal is to explain how the building bricks of technology come together to create the world we live in. When your children create their first algorithm in the Codie app, they already made the first step towards unlocking the exciting possibilities that lie in modern technology.</p>

<h3>Codie is much more than a robot</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Codie is a creative tool that children can use in countless ways. Here are our two favorite examples that our little testers made up.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Children can simply transform Codie into an alarm clock. Codie’s light sensors measure the brightness and when it reaches a level, the buzzer goes off.</p>

<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have conducted some serious user testing with children. The feedback we gained during these tests provided valuable information on how to further develop Codie. Our most important finding was, that easy-to-understand patterns and instant feedback must be the core values of our design. The human mind is constantly looking for patterns everywhere to make sense of it’s surroundings. With Codie your child can see the coding patterns created by them in action right when they tap the play button and this immediate feedback reinforces what they learned.</p>

<h3>Our story</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Codie was envisioned back in 2013, at a startup weekend, where Adam and Andras, our co-founders met. They won first place in the startup competition with the idea for Codie. After taking part in numerous startup events, where Codie was met with enthusiasm, we decided to bring our product to the market. Our proudest moments were when Codie won the national finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup, and when we were included Kairos Global Summit 2014 Top Ten!</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>USA, Canada, Europe:</strong> $30</li>
<li>
<strong>Australia and New Zealand:</strong> $40</li>
<li>
<strong>Rest of the world:</strong> $45</li>
<li>
<strong>Hungary:</strong> $8<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<a name=""faq-age"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<p><strong>What is the recommended age group for Codie?</strong>
<br/>We've designed Codie to be fun for a broad age group. Our robot offers something to explore to kids from the age of 5 and even adults enjoyed playing with Codie very much. Nevertheless, our main age group is kids 8-12 of age.</p>
<a name=""faq-wood"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<p><strong>Why the wood?</strong>
<br/>We felt that for you - the backers who kindly support us during the campaign - we would like to give something special. A mass produced molded plastic chassis is not special. But a toy robot made out of articulated wood? That’s something. Also, all of our little wooden Codies are assembled by hand.</p>
<p><strong>Isn’t this less environment-friendly?</strong>
<br/><span>Actually, the environmental footprint of making a wooden chassis is less than using huge industrial machines to manufacture plastic ones and it produces less non-degrading industrial waste. </span></p>
<p><strong>Is the wood sensitive to liquids and dirt?</strong>
<br/>We did our best to minimize the possible permanent damage. Codie is treated with child-friendly water based, protective wood stain to make the wood more resistant to everyday use.</p>
<p><strong>How fragile is Codie?</strong>
<br/>The wood what makes up Codie is very tough material, even more than the traditional types of plastics. Also, we designed the chassis so that it is durable and contains few weak spots. So you shouldn’t worry more for Codie than for any other toy.</p>
<a name=""faq-battery"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<p><strong>Do I need batteries for Codie?</strong>
<br/>No! The powerful integrated battery provides the juice needed. You can charge Codie with the included fast charger wall adapter.</p>
<a name=""faq-charging"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<p><strong>Why can't I charge from USB?</strong>
<br/>USB charging is convenient, but - we must all admit - slow. Especially when charging devices with large batteries. Codie has a larger capacity battery than most smartphones. If you had to charge Codie with USB, it could take up to eight hours. With our dedicated fast charger wall adapter, you can charge Codie in less than two hours.</p>
<p><strong>How big is Codie?</strong>
<br/>The dimensions of Codie are 11.6cm x 10cm x 4cm/4.6in x 3.9in x 1.6in.</p>
<a name=""faq-safety"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<p><strong>Is Codie safe for my child?</strong>
<br/>Codie is designed with kids in mind, so the accidents from unintended use are less likely. Nonetheless, we designed it with utter care for child safety: no sharp edges, a size fit for the hands of children, very few removable parts, child-friendly water based wood stain.</p>
<a name=""faq-carpet"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<p><b>Will Codie work on carpet?</b>
<br/>Depends on the carpet! Low pile and dense carpets are no obstacle to Codie, as the tracks can stay on the surface.
<br/>However the high pile, loosely-knit carpets, especially the cut-pile ones (""shag"" or ""frieze"") probably will trap Codie as he sinks into the soft surface.<br/>But who knows? We might be able to make the situation better eg. with some special <i>carpet crawler tracks</i>. ;)<br/>Here are some examples:
<br/>Codie will happily run on these:<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1356779/files/20150405095245-works_all.jpg?1428252765"" src="""" style=""""/>

Codie is a new robotic toy that teaches the principles of computer coding, with the mission to help understand how technology works. Codie comes with a unique visual programming language, which organizes the code of robotics into blocks. By arranging these blocks together you create real programs, which are then executed by the toy robot. While playing with Codie, you get to learn about how computers think and get to know the fundamental programming concepts in a fun and playful way.






















>>>GO TO OUR WEBSHOP<<< 





Our children need to understand how technology works
Teaching children coding will be useful for the rest of their lives. Learning programming with Codie develops kids' problem solving and critical thinking skills while unleashing their inner creativity. Kids become makers while building their programs with our intuitive application, as creative and colorful as the children using it. We created Codie to provide our youngest and brightest generation the tool they need to acquire the basics of coding.
Featured on






The advanced code of robotics organized into blocks that children can easily arrange to make programs




We created our own programming language to teach kids coding, our application bridges the gap between kids’ imagination and the algorithmic thinking. It’s made possible by using the colorful blocks, and connecting them together with arrows showing the direction of execution. Children can learn the basics of coding using real programming patterns, like if-else structures, variables or loops.


Simple and effortless interface makes programming easy to understand at a glance




The benefits of the touchscreen enables us to create a truly intuitive user interface, and avoiding the need for a keyboard. Every control is designed to be as easy to use as possible. We created plenty of custom controls to give more meaning to numeric parameters.


Separated data flow




To avoid large programs become a confusing mess, we used a new approach: separated data operations. They also look similar to the action blocks, the difference is that the arrows now transfer data between the blocks. Every action block can have it’s data flow, and depend on different calculations for the parameters.

The groundbreaking novelty of the Codie programming language lies in its layered structure. The application gradually introduces different programming concepts, and as kids get to know these more and more complex structures, so do they unlock more possibilities within Codie. Codie grows with you child as they will have new features to explore for a long time.

Want to know how our app really teaches kids coding? Click here!




A toy robot, to make the whole experience the way kids like it - tangible and real



We imagined the robotic toy as the counterpart of the revolutionary application. Stuffed with the most advanced equipment and thanks to its sturdy build quality, Codie will provide entertainment for the whole family for many hours to come. Codie comes fully assembled, just take it out of the box, pair it with your smartphone via wireless Bluetooth connection and you are ready to go. The Codie body is carved out of high-quality wood and every single unit is hand-crafted in our workshop.











Playful learning



Codie is not just toy, but rather a creative tool, a companion that augments other games. It’s a high-quality learning experience that is fun and provides your kids invaluable skills along the way. With Codie the whole process feels natural and seamless and children get empowered by the knowledge they gain.  It integrates into any game and enables meaningful interactions between kids and real life.

Codie goes way beyond than teaching coding to children. In our interpretation, coding is the understanding of how to use technology flexibly. The ultimate goal is to explain how the building bricks of technology come together to create the world we live in. When your children create their first algorithm in the Codie app, they already made the first step towards unlocking the exciting possibilities that lie in modern technology.



Codie is much more than a robot
Codie is a creative tool that children can use in countless ways. Here are our two favorite examples that our little testers made up.


Children can simply transform Codie into an alarm clock. Codie’s light sensors measure the brightness and when it reaches a level, the buzzer goes off.

Your kid can even learn dance moves with the help of Codie. Just program the steps, tap the play and let the party begin! 





We would be happy to hear about what your child has turned Codie into!
While playing with Codie, your child will become familiar with logical thinking and problem solving, the skills all interactions with technology is based on




Product design: patterns and feedback



We have conducted some serious user testing with children. The feedback we gained during these tests provided valuable information on how to further develop Codie. Our most important finding was, that easy-to-understand patterns and instant feedback must be the core values of our design. The human mind is constantly looking for patterns everywhere to make sense of it’s surroundings. With Codie your child can see the coding patterns created by them in action right when they tap the play button and this immediate feedback reinforces what they learned.

Our story
Codie was envisioned back in 2013, at a startup weekend, where Adam and Andras, our co-founders met. They won first place in the startup competition with the idea for Codie. After taking part in numerous startup events, where Codie was met with enthusiasm, we decided to bring our product to the market. Our proudest moments were when Codie won the national finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup, and when we were included Kairos Global Summit 2014 Top Ten!





A fast-paced 54 hour startup frenzy where young creative minds collide to bring new ideas to the world with help of experienced mentors.





One of the biggest startup accelerator programs in Europe, which helps early-stage ventures take their next steps towards success.




An international non-profit organization embracing young entrepreneurs from universities and launching programs in many countries.




The Imagine Cup in an annual competition hosted by Microsoft whose aim is to bring students with a spirit to change the world through technology.




An annual entrepreneurship conference held in Vienna focused on technology and hardware-software development.




Codie underwent a long design process. A lot has changed since Codie’s first iteration.



Our small but committed team comes from different backgrounds, we have engineers, designers, seasoned marketing veterans and even psychologists on board. There’s one thing we all share: the passion for the advancement of technology.
We were introduced to a bunch of young bright girls, who were to apply for the local round of the FIRST LEGO® Leauge LEGO® Mindstorms programming cup. Their commitment was a real inspiration for us and we decided to help them with the preparations. And guess what? With the help of Codie they finished as one of the rewarded teams!






Why we need you 
We have a few fully operational prototypes of the robot and have conducted some serious performance testing with them. Codie accomplished the challenge and no misbehavior appeared during those trials. We are sure that the hardware is durable enough to provide countless hours of fun!
The unique new graphic programming language is ready and we have the iOS app in beta testing and we've just begun work on the Android version. With the valuable help of a few schools and a coding-focused local NGO (Skool), we were able to have our product tested by Codie’s real future users: kids. The children loved our app, but we drew some interesting conclusions from the tests and we are tweaking the software based on their feedback.
Codie is almost ready for production. We need your help to go the final mile of bringing Codie to market! We turned to the community of Indiegogo to open our idea to the public, your input and opinions are more than welcome! According to our plans, we should be able to deliver the first Codies by the end of October 2015.

Isn’t this less environment-friendly?
Actually, the environmental footprint of making a wooden chassis is less than using huge industrial machines to manufacture plastic ones and it produces less non-degrading industrial waste. 
Is the wood sensitive to liquids and dirt?
We did our best to minimize the possible permanent damage. Codie is treated with child-friendly water based, protective wood stain to make the wood more resistant to everyday use.
How fragile is Codie?
The wood what makes up Codie is very tough material, even more than the traditional types of plastics. Also, we designed the chassis so that it is durable and contains few weak spots. So you shouldn’t worry more for Codie than for any other toy.

Do I need batteries for Codie?
No! The powerful integrated battery provides the juice needed. You can charge Codie with the included fast charger wall adapter.

Why can't I charge from USB?
USB charging is convenient, but - we must all admit - slow. Especially when charging devices with large batteries. Codie has a larger capacity battery than most smartphones. If you had to charge Codie with USB, it could take up to eight hours. With our dedicated fast charger wall adapter, you can charge Codie in less than two hours.
How big is Codie?
The dimensions of Codie are 11.6cm x 10cm x 4cm/4.6in x 3.9in x 1.6in.

Is Codie safe for my child?
Codie is designed with kids in mind, so the accidents from unintended use are less likely. Nonetheless, we designed it with utter care for child safety: no sharp edges, a size fit for the hands of children, very few removable parts, child-friendly water based wood stain.

Will Codie work on carpet?
Depends on the carpet! Low pile and dense carpets are no obstacle to Codie, as the tracks can stay on the surface.
However the high pile, loosely-knit carpets, especially the cut-pile ones (""shag"" or ""frieze"") probably will trap Codie as he sinks into the soft surface.But who knows? We might be able to make the situation better eg. with some special carpet crawler tracks. ;)Here are some examples:
Codie will happily run on these:

This app also provides a great service for those who cannot afford to purchase books; with the lend option a student can borrow a book for a period of time, agreed upon by both the lender and borrower, for a low cost. There will be security measures to make sure that both lender and borrower are safe. The app will provide a nifty messaging feature to allow individuals to communicate without giving out personal information other than their name and college.

This app also provides a great service for those who cannot afford to purchase books; with the lend option a student can borrow a book for a period of time, agreed upon by both the lender and borrower, for a low cost. There will be security measures to make sure that both lender and borrower are safe. The app will provide a nifty messaging feature to allow individuals to communicate without giving out personal information other than their name and college. Those who use the app will be rewarded with BLT cash which will allow them to purchase brand new books for a cheaper price.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>",":::: GERMAN VERSION ::: (To enjoy the english text, please scroll down)Worum geht’s?Ganz kurz und ohne BlaBla:Der Nachfolger meines Buches DIAMONDTIMES soll noch schöner, größer und besser werden. Das geht nur mit Eurer Hilfe – und zwar in Form von Vorbestellungen und Lust auf wunderbare Extras, die ich zusätzlich liefern werde.Also: für alle, die TALES OF AN AMERICAN SUMMER gerne hätten – das Buch kann es nur hier und auf diese Weise geben.Ihr könnt mich Tag und Nacht unter mail@benbernschneider.com erreichen und ausfragen. Ich werde am laufenden Band in Videos und Posts über die Entwicklungen berichten, Bilder und einen Haufen Liebe teilen. Wir sorgen für geballte Vorfreude, bis das Ding da ist.
Und nun mit Hintergrund:Ich heiße Ben Bernschneider, bin Fotograf aus Hamburg (www.benbernschneider.com) und habe 2014 einen Bildband namens DIAMONDTIMES veröffentlicht. Dieser wurde mir – zum Glück – innerhalb von 7 Tagen restlos aus den Händen gerissen. Und dafür liebe ich jeden Einzelnen von Euch.Mir wäre wichtig, es mit dem Nachfolger ordentlich krachen zu lassen und das beste Buch überhaupt abzuliefern.
Und dafür brauche ich Leute, die bereits jetzt ein Teil davon sein wollen, Bock auf einen Nachfolger haben und das Ding mit feuchten Händen vorbestellen!Meine Fotografie wurde letztes Jahr von ""colourful, cheeky, joyful"" über ""sparkling and gritty"" bis hin zu ""softporn análogo"" beschrieben. Für mich ist es ein Mix aus coming-of-age-, college-, high-school-, 80er-Film und einer Portion hedonistischem Jetset- und teen-savoir-vivre-Lifestyle. Das klingt vielleicht scheiße, resultiert aber in schönen analogen Bildern, die mein Herz berühren. C-Heads hat ein paar schöne Worte für DIAMONDTIMES gefunden: Interview.Anbei ein paar beliebte Beispiele aus DIAMONDTIMES:
Ich bin vielleicht dabei! Wie soll’s laufen?Ich brauche als allerkleinste Sicherheit: 7.000 Euro.
Nun ja, insgesamt werde ich WEIT mehr als diese aufgerufenen 7.000 Euro brauchen. Der Betrag muss auch noch versteuert werden, außerdem wollen PayPal und IndieGoGo eine Scheibe abhaben.
Aber das wäre die halbe Basis, um das Ding drucken zu lassen. 
Um die restlichen Entwicklungs-, Scan-, Druck-, Produktions-, Reise-, Model- und Stylingkosten zu decken, muss ich noch was tun, aber das wichtigste, um es dieses Jahr zu verwirklichen, wären die angestrebten 7 Mille.
Daher würde ich das ganze in Schritten angehen:

Bei 7.000 € wird das Buch, wie bereits DIAMONDTIMES, in DIN A5 produziert. Jedoch mit einer höheren Seitenanzahl als 180. 


Bei 9.000 € schwenken wir auf DIN A4 um, gehen aber auf Softcover, dafür gehts rauf bis 324 Seiten.


Bei 11.000 € gehen wir wieder auf Hardcover UND DIN A4 und senken die Seitenzahl auf 244.


Bei allem darüber und erfolgreichen Verhandlungen mit dem Wunschdrucker heben wir die Seitenstärke. YAY!


WICHTIG: sollte das Ziel von 7.000 € nicht erreicht werden bekommen ALLE natürlich automatisch Ihr Geld zurück und ich bin halt traurig. (Natürlich werde ich nicht heulen. Life‘s a game. Also kein schlechtes Gewissen!)Klingt geil! Where’s the catch? Risiken?Butter bei die Fische – ich mache das Buch. Auch wenn ich es, von einem Kojoten halbtot gebissen, produzieren muss. Das einzige Risiko ist das Erscheinungsdatum.
Am liebsten wäre mir ein Produktionszeitraum von Juni-September, Editing im Oktober, Druck im November und im Dezember liegen wir uns alle betrunken mit dem Buch in den Armen.Notfalls kann ich erst Ende August anfangen. Aber dann muss ich alles ein bisschen verdichten, mir mehr Mitarbeiter dazu holen und mache trotzdem im November den Sack zu. Dieses Buch wird zu 95% im Dezember fertig sein – zu 5% im Januar.Als zweites Risiko sehe ich den Buchtitel. Es muss in meiner Hand bleiben, das Buch umzubenennen. Falls ich mit einem alten Indianer in einem Tipi sitze und auf Kakteen-Sud plötzlich eine Epiphanie habe, dass das Ding anders heißen muss, muss ich das tun! Habt Verständnis.
Sorry, ich lebe im real existierenden Sozialismus und habe gar kein Geld ODER eigentlich mag ich keine Fotos, keine halbnackten Frauen, keine Palmen und schon gar keine Bücher.Kein Thema – wir wäre es, wenn du einem Bruder aushilfst und diese crowdfunding Kampagne teilst?!

<p>Firstly we would like to thank everybody who has donated to this campaign so far. Whilst this is an impressive milestone, there is still more reason to donate. </p>
<p>Once Scott returns from the tour his next hurdle is the $2,000 debt for the accommodation. As it stands, he will be 'pushing himself to the limit' to repay this generous loan from the Academy. The deadline is 21st December (Right before Christmas), only leaving 3 months to pay back his outstanding debt.</p>
<p>Initially we thought it to be a far-fetched dream to achieve an end goal of $1,500. Scott (as you can tell from the video above) is completely overwhelmed with the generosity of backers thus far. He is also relieved that he need not endure the torture of 2 min noodles for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>As a person who is very passionate about puns, Scott is under the impression that the ""$30 Pun-a-day Subscription"" reward is the most valuable of all perks. If he reaches $2,500 he will extend the subscription to <i>2 months</i> of original puns. This is gives you double the value so please donate today!</p>
<p>Thank you again for your donations, thank you for sharing the campaign and thank you for spreading his message.</p>

Author Syarief Syaifulloh wants to inspire and educate children about the benefits of growing fresh foods from their own backyard.</i></p><p>Syarief says: When I was a child in Indonesia, I was surrounded by farm lands and mountain ranges. I woke up to the smell of horse manure and the fresh air of the countryside. I enjoyed my childhood and would never want to forget how I grew up. I want my children to have the outdoor experience I had when I was their age. They were born in the city, without the feel of the countryside. I didn’t think it was fair for them. I started to tweak city life and bring bits and pieces of my childhood into their life.</p><p></p><p>One of our goals is to support bilingual literacy. The book is translated into Indonesian by our friend Jeanny Kwa. Another goal is to show elements of Indonesian art and culture. The book is illustrated with traditional Indonesian batik designs by Donna Backues, an artist from Philadelphia. I am proud of my homeland and would like to share a piece of it with my children and children around the world. </p><p>For a 12-month period, my wife and I, along with Morning Circle Media President Cynthia Kreilick, took photographs of Haiqal and myself prepping, planting, tending, and harvesting our backyard garden. It was a fun project and Haiqal was thoroughly entertained to be the main character of this book!</p><p></p><h3>Funding</h3><div>Our team would like to donate 300 copies of <i>Haiqal's Garden</i> for children in Philadelphia schools. It will also enable four author visits and four gardening events to low-income families in our surrounding area. We want to spread healthy lifestyles and teach kids and their families to be self-sufficient and good stewards of the Earth!<p></p>
<p>As a thank you for funding our project, we have given several perks so you can start encouraging your little ones and introduce them to gardening. You can start in your own backyard!</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Community Impact</h3>
<div>Your contribution is UNIQUE! You will be powering the first campaign to bring a children's gardening book to both Indonesian-speaking and English-speaking families all over the world. There are no other books like <i>Haiqal's Garden</i>!<p></p>
<p>The book's publisher, Morning Circle Media, prides itself on shining a big light on the contributions immigrants are making in the U.S.A. They have educated hundreds of children, teachers, and families about the languages and cultures that give color and richness to our cities and towns.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Children's book publishing is a labor of love. As authors, we write and make beautiful illustrations because we believe in the transformative power of good literature. Printing books is expensive.

</div></div>","About Haiqal's GardenHaiqal’s Garden is Morning Circle Media's FIRST bilingual children’s book, in Indonesian and English, that promotes green living and urban farming. Author Syarief Syaifulloh wants to inspire and educate children about the benefits of growing fresh foods from their own backyard.Syarief says: When I was a child in Indonesia, I was surrounded by farm lands and mountain ranges. I woke up to the smell of horse manure and the fresh air of the countryside. I enjoyed my childhood and would never want to forget how I grew up. I want my children to have the outdoor experience I had when I was their age. They were born in the city, without the feel of the countryside. I didn’t think it was fair for them. I started to tweak city life and bring bits and pieces of my childhood into their life.One of our goals is to support bilingual literacy. The book is translated into Indonesian by our friend Jeanny Kwa. Another goal is to show elements of Indonesian art and culture. The book is illustrated with traditional Indonesian batik designs by Donna Backues, an artist from Philadelphia. I am proud of my homeland and would like to share a piece of it with my children and children around the world. For a 12-month period, my wife and I, along with Morning Circle Media President Cynthia Kreilick, took photographs of Haiqal and myself prepping, planting, tending, and harvesting our backyard garden. It was a fun project and Haiqal was thoroughly entertained to be the main character of this book!FundingOur team would like to donate 300 copies of Haiqal's Garden for children in Philadelphia schools. It will also enable four author visits and four gardening events to low-income families in our surrounding area. We want to spread healthy lifestyles and teach kids and their families to be self-sufficient and good stewards of the Earth!
As a thank you for funding our project, we have given several perks so you can start encouraging your little ones and introduce them to gardening. You can start in your own backyard!



Community Impact
Your contribution is UNIQUE! You will be powering the first campaign to bring a children's gardening book to both Indonesian-speaking and English-speaking families all over the world. There are no other books like Haiqal's Garden!
The book's publisher, Morning Circle Media, prides itself on shining a big light on the contributions immigrants are making in the U.S.A. They have educated hundreds of children, teachers, and families about the languages and cultures that give color and richness to our cities and towns.
Risks & Challenges
Children's book publishing is a labor of love. As authors, we write and make beautiful illustrations because we believe in the transformative power of good literature. Printing books is expensive. Profit margins are small. Without your help, this will be  a steep mountain to climb for our team.
The quality of Morning Circle Media children's books and the unique subject matter have produced a loyal, enthusiastic following of schools, teachers, parents, and children. 
This campaign will help us distribute the financial burden so that, at the end of 60 days, we'll have what we need to make this one-of-a-kind book dream a reality!

<div>We live in a world of confusion. A world that teaches consumerism over compassion and complacency over humility. We live among people searching for purpose and passion, turning to self-medication to dull the pain or the next self help book hoping to find some answers. This is not what we were made for. We were not made to exist, but to thrive. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The joy of the gospel is a call out of ourselves and into a personal encounter with Jesus Christ. We were made for the Truth. By rejecting the lies of our cultures and living authentic Christian lives, we are freed from the bondage of sin and are able to truly live new life in Christ. </div>

<i>""The joy of the gospel fills the hearts and lives of all who encounter Jesus. Those who accept his offer of salvation are set free from sin, sorrow, inner emptiness and loneliness.

</div></div>","""I have come to set the earth on fire, and how I wish it were already blazing!""  Who We Are
The LCI is a year long Catholic education and formation program designed to spread the mission of the new evangilization in the East and West. Pope John Paul II called the the church to ""breath with her two lungs"" [the East and the West]. Established after the fall of communism in 1992, the LCI is helping to rebuild the Church in countries where Goodness, Truth, and Beauty were repressed.

What our students receive:
 A year of experience living in a Catholic community
A full immersion year long English program
Intensive study of theology and catechism 
Participation in formation and evanglization courses
Interaction and relationships with other young people with the same goals
Tools necessary to make a difference in their native countries
  Why We Need You What we do is only possible through the support, generosity, and prayers of people like you. All of our students are supported by scholarships which cover tuition costs and living expenses. Currently we are trying to expand our program to provide more young people the opportunity to study here. Every donation of any size makes a difference. Your donations go directly to the students and cover costs such as:  Tuition
Books
Food
Living Expenses 

“There is no other school where I can receive such a well-rounded Catholic education, where the Faith is lived by the teachers and the students surrounding me. I will be able to take these experiences and this education to use as a foundation for living my Faith for the rest of my life.”
- Ayya Cholukova, Turkmenistan

   The Impact We believe that in order to change a culture we must start on a personal level, by helping each human person encounter Christ. The LCI has over 450 graduates from 26 countries who are now living and working through out eastern Europe and Asia to build the Church in their communities. What we do is only a drop in the bucket compared to the lasting effects our graduates have on their communities. Our graduates work in various occupations such as teachers, lawyers, businessmen, youth ministers, doctors, English translators, priests, and religious. 

“Many of us came to Gaming from the secular world, having not much connection with the Church, not having Christian experience and knowledge, and returned to our homes renewed and with a clear vision of Christian life, plus the knowledge of English. I always tell my friends that the year I spent in Gaming was the best year of my life, and it’s true…God touched my soul in a very powerful way.”
- Lena Bogoyavlenskaya, Russia   Why Joy? Why Truth?  The Joy of the Gospel the Freedom of Truth
We live in a world of confusion. A world that teaches consumerism over compassion and complacency over humility. We live among people searching for purpose and passion, turning to self-medication to dull the pain or the next self help book hoping to find some answers. This is not what we were made for. We were not made to exist, but to thrive. 

The joy of the gospel is a call out of ourselves and into a personal encounter with Jesus Christ. We were made for the Truth. By rejecting the lies of our cultures and living authentic Christian lives, we are freed from the bondage of sin and are able to truly live new life in Christ. 


""The joy of the gospel fills the hearts and lives of all who encounter Jesus. Those who accept his offer of salvation are set free from sin, sorrow, inner emptiness and loneliness. With Christ joy is constantly born anew. In this Exhortation I wish to encourage the Christian faithful to embark upon a new chapter of evangelization marked by this joy, while pointing out new paths for the Church’s journey in years to come.""

- The Holy Father Francis

students are forced either suffer through the day with ill fitting shoes making

of these things distract students from reaching their full potential and

<h3>StarShine Accepts XPRIZE Challenge</h3>
<div>
<p>StarShine Planet’s XPRIZE project, known as the Global
Learning Environment &amp; Experience, or GLEE for short, is in full swing. StarShine is one of 188 teams competing and collaborating to achieve the
XPRIZE goals. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436206263/hqlpsb5ehotexfrjypmq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>To remind you, the long-term goal of the Global Learning
XPRIZE is to end illiteracy, world-wide. 
As a step towards that goal, the XPRIZE organization created a $15M purse
to stimulate and reward the development of the tablet-based software tool that best improves student performance in reading, writing, and math over the course of an 18-month field test in sub-Saharan Africa.  The target population is children 7 to 10 years old, and the field tests will be conducted by five finalist teams, with each team being assigned approximately 600 students.  The finalists will be selected by judges on the basis of learning potential, design quality, and implementation quality.  The XPRIZE winner will be selected based on student performance improvement, weighted 60% to reading, 10% to writing, and 30% to math.</p>
At the same time, a GLEE design team of ten dedicated
individuals has been stepping through a structured design process led by Jack
Ring. Jack is a Fellow of the International Council on Systems Engineering with
decades of experience 
designing, implementing, and radically improving
systems ranging from satellite launch systems and e-commerce to high-performance
automobile racing engines.  Under his
guidance, the team went through a brainstorming process to identify desired and
undesired outcomes of the project across a comprehensive set of stakeholders,
and then prioritized the outcomes to determine the top 27 effects we envision
our system contributing to its users and other stakeholders. 
Following that, we began accumulating a
collection of system “vignettes”, illustrating how we think the system we
develop will be used by young students day by day.  These vignettes will illustrate how the
students initially become familiar and competent with using the tablet hardware
and software, and what the students will see as they progress through a
tablet-based curriculum focused reading, writing, arithmetic—and StarShine. 
Meanwhile we are vigorously recruiting sources
of excellent ideas and tools that expedite the pace and scope of learning, and
sources of information technology and systems for hosting these assets on the
Android platform. We will have much more to say about that soon.</div>

<p>Pope Francis wants to put the curriculum from her Phoenix charter school, StarShine Academy, in his orphanages around the world.</p>
<p>""You learn how to take care of yourself, how to take care of the things around you,"" Trish McCarty said.</p>
<p>Skyping from Rome, the charter school's founder explains how she was invited to meet Pope Francis.</p>
<p>""This man has an aura and a gentleness that most people describe and you could feel it,"" she said. ""In fact, I've been so emotional all week.""</p>
<p>McCarty also sat down with Vatican leaders because the pope wants to utilize her peace-based curriculum in the church's global orphanages called Boys' &amp; Girls' Towns. They visited one in Italy.</p>

<p>""My philosophy was that when you teach people how to have a loving, safe, kind environment, they start doing that themselves,"" McCarty said.</p>
<p>""Kids need our help,"" she said. ""They don't feel loved, they don't feel safe and they don't feel like they have a future, and they do. They're our future.""</p>
<p>McCarty said their methods have proven to work in Phoenix where their kids are often below the poverty line.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436207371/lyvjo3mcukhm28wc2kdy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>""The first place that we opened was on the worst drive-by shooting street in Phoenix and within months the crime stopped,"" she said.</p>
<p>She returns Monday with rosaries given by the pope and although not Catholic, she now feels a divine inspiration to spread what they started in the Valley to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>""I just think that we got a big wind beneath our wings to say that we're all in this together,"" she said.</p>
<p>McCarty said their next step is to translate their curriculum into Italian so the Vatican can start implementing it first in their Boys' &amp; Girls' Towns in Italy.</p>

Learning Environment & Experience, or GLEE for short, is in full swing. StarShine is one of 188 teams competing and collaborating to achieve the
XPRIZE goals. 


To remind you, the long-term goal of the Global Learning
XPRIZE is to end illiteracy, world-wide. 
As a step towards that goal, the XPRIZE organization created a $15M purse
to stimulate and reward the development of the tablet-based software tool that best improves student performance in reading, writing, and math over the course of an 18-month field test in sub-Saharan Africa.  The target population is children 7 to 10 years old, and the field tests will be conducted by five finalist teams, with each team being assigned approximately 600 students.  The finalists will be selected by judges on the basis of learning potential, design quality, and implementation quality.  The XPRIZE winner will be selected based on student performance improvement, weighted 60% to reading, 10% to writing, and 30% to math.
At the same time, a GLEE design team of ten dedicated
individuals has been stepping through a structured design process led by Jack
Ring. Jack is a Fellow of the International Council on Systems Engineering with
decades of experience 
designing, implementing, and radically improving
systems ranging from satellite launch systems and e-commerce to high-performance
automobile racing engines.  Under his
guidance, the team went through a brainstorming process to identify desired and
undesired outcomes of the project across a comprehensive set of stakeholders,
and then prioritized the outcomes to determine the top 27 effects we envision
our system contributing to its users and other stakeholders. 
Following that, we began accumulating a
collection of system “vignettes”, illustrating how we think the system we
develop will be used by young students day by day.  These vignettes will illustrate how the
students initially become familiar and competent with using the tablet hardware
and software, and what the students will see as they progress through a
tablet-based curriculum focused reading, writing, arithmetic—and StarShine. 
Meanwhile we are vigorously recruiting sources
of excellent ideas and tools that expedite the pace and scope of learning, and
sources of information technology and systems for hosting these assets on the
Android platform. We will have much more to say about that soon.

Trish Meets the Pope!
Pope to utilize Phoenix school's curriculum in church's global orphanages

PHOENIX (KPHO/KTVK) -

Pope Francis wants to put the curriculum from her Phoenix charter school, StarShine Academy, in his orphanages around the world.
""You learn how to take care of yourself, how to take care of the things around you,"" Trish McCarty said.
Skyping from Rome, the charter school's founder explains how she was invited to meet Pope Francis.
""This man has an aura and a gentleness that most people describe and you could feel it,"" she said. ""In fact, I've been so emotional all week.""
McCarty also sat down with Vatican leaders because the pope wants to utilize her peace-based curriculum in the church's global orphanages called Boys' & Girls' Towns. They visited one in Italy.

""My philosophy was that when you teach people how to have a loving, safe, kind environment, they start doing that themselves,"" McCarty said.
""Kids need our help,"" she said. ""They don't feel loved, they don't feel safe and they don't feel like they have a future, and they do. They're our future.""
McCarty said their methods have proven to work in Phoenix where their kids are often below the poverty line.


""The first place that we opened was on the worst drive-by shooting street in Phoenix and within months the crime stopped,"" she said.
She returns Monday with rosaries given by the pope and although not Catholic, she now feels a divine inspiration to spread what they started in the Valley to the rest of the world.
""I just think that we got a big wind beneath our wings to say that we're all in this together,"" she said.
McCarty said their next step is to translate their curriculum into Italian so the Vatican can start implementing it first in their Boys' & Girls' Towns in Italy.

<p>I came to China in January 2012 to practice Kung Fu in a chinese Martial Arts Academy. After three months training with different Masters I finally found an amazing, caring and unique martial artist as a master: Master Wang.</p>

<p>This year he finally managed to<span style=""background: #ffffff;""> found </span>his own Kung Fu school in Henan, Deng Feng, where he could train and teach, independent from any other authority, the way he always wanted.

<p>However, because of misplaced trust in people who provided him with the wrong paperwork he started having problems with the local authorities, which are now forcing him to shut down his school. This not only means that he can't do what he loves the most, teaching, but also it means that after ten years of hard work there is nothing left for him and he has to start all over again.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""ES-TRAD"" style=""font-size: 14pt; font-family: Times;"">Hello!<span style="""">  </span>I’m Stephanie, a recently retired
public school teacher volunteering in<span style=""""> </span>Ecuador’s Amazon basin at Yachana High School.<span style=""""> I am one of five teachers teaching </span>both mestizo and indigenous students representing four distinct indigenous
communities, Kichwa, Shuar, Huaorani, and Shiviar.<span style=""""></span> This year, I have three
groups of ten students each, rotating in and out of external internships and
the high school every three weeks in an unprecedented gap year providing practical  hands-on education. We want to document  the students' activities this year through digital photography when they are participating in their internships.  We also have many activities going on at the high school.  In conjunction with the yearbook, students
are also excited about designing and developing a digital pen pal program with American students where they would share pictures of where they sleep, eat, play, and study.<span style="""">  </span>The photos will include short <span style=""""></span>explanations in either Spanish or
English. But we need cameras.  Even though the school experiences sporadic electricity and intermittent Internet, we have the means to put the yearbook together.  Our satellite connection will allow us to regularly maintain a pen pal digital exchange to help practice our English and to form relationships with students from other parts of the world.<br/></span></p>
<br/><span lang=""ES-TRAD"" style=""font-size: 18pt; font-family: Cambria;""></span>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Kids, for the first time in the Amazonian basin, will be able to share ideas, cultures, traditions with their American digital pen pals. We will also be able to document the activities throughout the year which will be turned into a yearbook by the students.  Our personal goals at the school support 
sustainability and conservation, both concepts their American pen pals 
would also benefit from learning. The future of the world depends on what we 
teach our children and putting a personal face on it makes our 
shrinking world more real and more available to both cultures.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are an NGO.. always surviving from donations and grants.  Money is always difficult to find, and it doesn't usually go for the ""frills.""  Cameras would be considered extra..and there is never money for this. But for me, having the students exposed to a creative avenue for expressing themselves, while at the same time developing a open channel of communication between another culture is a win win. <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Need to Do<br/>

</div></div>","Our Story
Hello!  I’m Stephanie, a recently retired
public school teacher volunteering in Ecuador’s Amazon basin at Yachana High School. I am one of five teachers teaching both mestizo and indigenous students representing four distinct indigenous
communities, Kichwa, Shuar, Huaorani, and Shiviar. This year, I have three
groups of ten students each, rotating in and out of external internships and
the high school every three weeks in an unprecedented gap year providing practical  hands-on education. We want to document  the students' activities this year through digital photography when they are participating in their internships.  We also have many activities going on at the high school.  In conjunction with the yearbook, students
are also excited about designing and developing a digital pen pal program with American students where they would share pictures of where they sleep, eat, play, and study.  The photos will include short explanations in either Spanish or
English. But we need cameras.  Even though the school experiences sporadic electricity and intermittent Internet, we have the means to put the yearbook together.  Our satellite connection will allow us to regularly maintain a pen pal digital exchange to help practice our English and to form relationships with students from other parts of the world.


The Impact
Kids, for the first time in the Amazonian basin, will be able to share ideas, cultures, traditions with their American digital pen pals. We will also be able to document the activities throughout the year which will be turned into a yearbook by the students.  Our personal goals at the school support 
sustainability and conservation, both concepts their American pen pals 
would also benefit from learning. The future of the world depends on what we 
teach our children and putting a personal face on it makes our 
shrinking world more real and more available to both cultures.

We are an NGO.. always surviving from donations and grants.  Money is always difficult to find, and it doesn't usually go for the ""frills.""  Cameras would be considered extra..and there is never money for this. But for me, having the students exposed to a creative avenue for expressing themselves, while at the same time developing a open channel of communication between another culture is a win win. 

What We Need & What You Need to Do
Ideally, I need 2000.00 to buy digital cameras.  I would like to get fifteen cameras in case some break or the humidity gets to them. The total amount that is donated will be used entirely for buying cameras.  Someone in the states will bring them down to us on their next trip because buying them in the states is more cost effective. If the total requested amount does not come, I will use what is donated to buy as many cameras as possible. Please donate through PayPal at reinerts@sbcglobal.net

Please don't stop now - every dollar counts and will make a big difference for our kids. Support Our New Ambassador ProgramBecause our teachers and Principals have told us they and their kids would be excited - we have begun a pilot program to utilize people who do AMAZING things outside of sports. We are beginning to work with writers, artists, coders, entrepreneurs and all around amazing people who do amazing things to be volunteer mentors to kids across the continent and we need your help to make it happen! **Scroll to the bottom to take a look at the gear that goes along with each impact you make**What We Need & What You GetThis campaign will fund a pilot for our Ambassador Program – giving more kids the opportunity to learn from inspiring figures who role model the process of excellence and teach kids about what it takes to set goals, persevere, and achieve.  We have a huge wait list of amazing teachers, and demand for our programming grows every day. Your gift will help us develop this program, reaching 1,500 students in the near term and many thousands more down the road.This is what your funds will make happen:

Mentor recruitment, selection and training


Teacher selection and training


Curriculum development


Video editing 


Scheduling and conducting Google Hangouts between mentors and classrooms


Teacher and mentor support


Teacher network/community development


Really. Amazing. Experiences. For 1,500 kids. (50 classrooms * 30 students = 1,500 students)

Any funds raised over our $10,000 goal will be used to bring on additional mentors and classrooms – that means more lives changed, and more kids set up for success!Two-time Olympic Medalist and national champion Elana Meyers visits her students in Phildelphia, PA.We're Proud Of This: Our Impact on KidsWe believe every child has the right to learn the process of excellence, yet many students in under-served communities face significant barriers to gaining these critical skills. Therefore we work hard to partner with teachers to instill qualities of excellence in students that will last the rest of their lives.We measure for improvements in key areas for students’ future success including goal setting ability and perseverance, school engagement, digital literacy, and interpersonal skills; areas that lead to increased academic performance. * for more information on how we help kids, click here.(l) Gold medalists Meryl Davis & Charlie White chat with  their students in Denver;       (r) Bronze medalist Erin Hamlin visits students in Wisconsin.We see some really amazing impacts happen in the classrooms we work with.

<h2>What is Vivir Despiertos (Wake Up)?</h2>
<p><a href=""http://wkup.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wake Up</a> is an active global community of young mindfulness practitioners, both monastic and lay, inspired by the teachings of Zen Master and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh. We come together to practice mindfulness in order to take care of ourselves, nourish happiness and contribute to building a healthier and a more compassionate society.</p>
<p>We want to help our world which is overloaded with intolerance, discrimination, craving, anger and despair. Seeing the environmental degradation caused by our society, we want to live in such a way that our planet Earth can survive for a long time.</p>
<p>Practicing mindfulness, concentration and insight enables us to cultivate tolerance, non-discrimination, understanding and compassion in ourselves and the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/820891/files/20140829092545-10247244_616673718421891_7275745697379884737_n.jpg?1409329545"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Our Practice</h3>
<p>We follow the <a href=""http://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/the-5-mindfulness-trainings/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Five Mindfulness Trainings</a>, which are ethical guidelines that offer concrete practices of true love and compassion, and a path towards a life in harmony with each other and the Earth. These guidelines are the foundation of our lives and represent our ideal of service.</p>
<p>Our practice is based on cultivating awareness of the breath and living deeply in the present moment, aware of what is happening within us and around us. This practice helps us to release the tension in our bodies and feelings, to live life deeply and more happily, and to use compassionate listening and loving speech to help restore communication and reconcile with others.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Roots of Wake Up: Inclusiveness</span></p>
<p>The Wake Up movement is inspired by Buddhism’s long tradition of wisdom and practices which help cultivate understanding and love; it is not based on beliefs or ideology. The spirit of our practice is close to the spirit of science; both help us cultivate an open and non-discriminating mind. We honor everyone’s diverse spiritual and cultural roots. You can join as a Christian, a Jew, a Muslim, as an agnostic or atheist, or member of any other spiritual or religious tradition.</p>
<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>We aspire to be a place of refuge, nourishment and support for anyone with an aspiration to transform their own suffering and contribute to a healthy and compassionate society. We gather weekly or monthly in Wake Up groups to practice sitting and walking meditation, to listen to a teaching, practice total relaxation, listen deeply to one another, and recite the Five Mindfulness Trainings.</p>
<p>We also organize mindfulness events and retreats on <b>Wake Up Tours like this one</b>.</p>

<blockquote>Necesitamos entrenar miles de maestros conscientes, decenas de miles de maestros, porque en todo lugar se necesita la práctica de la plena conciencia. — <b>Thich Nhat Hanh</b>
</blockquote>
<p>Durante los últimos veinte años las enseñanzas de Thich Nhat Hanh y de Plum Village se han ido expandiendo lentamente a través del mundo hispano-hablante, en la medida en que sus libros han comenzado a ser traducidos del Inglés al Español. En los últimos seis años mucho material se ha compartido también bajo la forma de videos subtitulados de las charlas del Dharma y también grabaciones en audio de sus traducciones.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Este año, 2014, ha sido un punto de inflexión: el fino hilo de agua nos ha inundado. Thich Nhat Hanh y 57 de sus discípulos monásticos desembarcaron en Madrid, España, el 25 de Abril, para dar inicio a <b><a href=""http://tnhspain.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">la primera gira de Plum Village en un país hispanohablante</a></b>. Un puñado de practicantes Latinoamericanos muy dedicados fueron capaces de juntar los fondos necesarios para acompañar a Thay en ésta gira, pero el costo de viajar en avión, la disparidad del costo de vida entre América Latina y Europa, hizo que ese viaje fuera muy difícil para la gran mayoría, y <b>apenas unos pocos pudieron afrontarlo.</b></p>

Estoy segura que ésta es la manera de comenzar a regar las semillas, para así poder continuar trabajando con niños y niñas y adolescentes indígenas.

</blockquote>
<p>Esta Gira de Vivir Despiertos (Wake Up) nos traerá un grupo de siete monásticos hispano-hablantes de Plum Village, quienes vendrán a cinco países de Latinoamérica: Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, Nicaragua y México. Esta Gira permitirá tener acceso a las enseñanzas y prácticas, ya no solo a unos pocos sino a millares de personas interesadas en las enseñanzas de Thay en todos éstos países, brindándoles la oportunidad de acercar la práctica de la plena conciencia a sus familias, escuelas y toda su comunidad.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Realmente necesitamos tu ayuda para plantar ésta semillas. </b>Los costos de  viaje de la Gira son sustancialmente altos; hay apenas un puñado de voluntarios en cada país y tienen poca ayuda financiera. <b>Esta gira no sería posible sin las donaciones de aquellos que vivimos en países como los Estados Unidos, Cánada, o países de Europa que son lo suficientemente afortunados como para tener los retiros de Thay y a los monásticos geográficamente cerca y accesibles a lo largo de todo el año.</b></p>

<h2>Que es Vivir Despiertos (Wake Up)?</h2>
<p>Vivir Despiertos (Wake Up) es una comunidad global de jóvenes practicantes de la plena conciencia inspirados en las enseñanzas del Maestro Zen y activista de la Paz, Thich Nhat Hanh. Nos reunimos para practicar la plena conciencia para así nutrir nuestra felicidad, cuidar de nosotros mismos y ayudar a construir una sociedad más sana y compasiva.</p>
<p>Queremos ayudar y mejorar nuestro mundo actual tan cargado de intolerancia, discriminación, adicciones, ira y desesperación. Atentos a la degradación del medio ambiente causada por nuestra sociedad, queremos vivir de una manera tal que ayudemos a nuestro planeta Tierra a existir por mucho más tiempo.</p>
<p>La práctica de mindfulness o plena conciencia, de la concentración y de la visión profunda nos permite cultivar la tolerancia, la comprensión y la compasión, en nosotros mismos y en el mundo.</p>
<h3>Nuestra práctica</h3>
<p>Estudiamos y practicamos Los Cinco Entrenamientos de la Plena Conciencia, que son una guía ética que nos ofrece prácticas concretas sobre el verdadero amor y la compasión, y un camino para vivir en armonía entre todos y con nuestro planeta. Esta Guía son la base sobre la que vivimos nuestras vidas y representan nuestra ideal de servicio para con la sociedad.</p>
<h3>Las raíces de Vivir Despiertos: Inclusividad</h3>
<p>El movimiento de Vivir Despiertos está inspirado en la larga tradición Budista de sabiduría y prácticas que ayudan a cultivar la comprensión y el amor; no se basa en creencias o ideologías. El espíritu de nuestra práctica se acerca al espíritu de la ciencia; ambos nos ayudan a cultivar una mente abierta y no discriminatoria. Aceptamos y honramos las raíces culturales y espirituales de todos. Puedes acercarte siendo cristiano, judío, musulmán, agnóstico o ateo, o siendo miembro de cualquier otra tradición espiritual o religiosa.</p>
<h3>Que hacemos</h3>
<p>Aspiramos a ser un lugar de refugio, que nutra y dé soporte a cualquiera que tenga la aspiración de transformar su propio sufrimiento y de contribuir para tener una sociedad mas sana y compasiva. Con nuestros grupos de Vivir Despiertos, nos reunimos periódicamente, semanal, quincenal o mensualmente, para practicar la meditación sentados y también caminando, escuchar las Enseñanzas, practicar la relajación total, escucharnos unos a otros con profunda atención y para recitar juntos Los Cinco Entrenamientos de la Plena Conciencia.</p>
<p>También organizamos eventos y/o retiros de Plena Conciencia en nuestras <b>giras de Vivir Despiertos, como es ésta</b>.  </p>

FINAL UPDATE:Dear Friends,Please act now to make the video documentary and Spanish teaching materials of the 2014 Vivir Despiertos tour a reality. Your donation, however small, can make the mindfulness teachings given on the recently completed six-week tour available to hundreds of thousands of Spanish speakers free online.We are in the final week of our fundraising campaign for what has been an incredible mindfulness tour in Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, Nicaragua and Mexico. Thanks to funds from the Thich Nhat Hanh Legacy Foundation and what we have raised so far we have been able to fund the trip, but to edit the raw footage filmed by Dutch filmmaker Wouter Verhoeven we still need to meet our goal of $37,000 with only a few days left!All those who have already donated, as well as those of you donating until the end of the campaign will enjoy a special preview link of the documentary as it comes to completion this coming spring of 2015. Without your donation we will be unable to cover the considerable costs over the next months of editing more than a terabyte of HD video material to make the documentary and other materials available to all.Thank you for your donation, and may we see you soon in Plum Village or Magnolia Grove Monastery.Br. Phap Luu and the Vivir Despiertos TeamVIDEO UPDATE:

Dear Friends,Please enjoy the short video update and thanks above from the monastics on tour in South America. They are in their third country, Colombia, after retreats, Days of Mindfulness for Educators, Wake Up Events and public talks in Santiago, Chile and Quito, Ecuador.We are almost halfway there with fundraising for the tour, but in these last weeks of the campaign we still need your help. Thank you for sharing this campaign widely with friends, family, Sangha members and your wider community. Together we are making positive change a reality!Read more about the trip on our blog here.


A Wake Up Tour in Latin America
We ask you now to take action.Your tax-deductible donation will make it possible for seven Plum Village monastics, Dharma teachers and disciples of Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh, to introduce thousands of children, young people, activists, teachers and others to the practice of mindfulness and awakening through retreats, Days of Mindfulness for Educators, Wake Up events for young people and public talks in Santiago, Chile; Quito, Ecuador; Bogotá, Colombia; Managua, Nicaragua; and México City, México this fall from September 21st to November 4th, 2014.We need to train thousands of mindfulness teachers, hundreds of thousands of teachers, because everywhere needs the practice of mindfulness. — Thich Nhat Hanh
For the past twenty years the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh (Thay) and Plum Village have been quietly spreading through the Spanish-speaking world, as Thay's books were translated from English into Spanish. In the past six years this wave of material has been joined by subtitled video Dharma talks and audio recordings of translations.This year, 2014, is a watershed year: the trickle has become a flood. Thich Nhat Hanh and 57 of his monastic students arrived in Madrid, Spain, on April 25th to kick off the first ever Plum Village tour in a Spanish-speaking country. A handful of dedicated practitioners from Latin America were able to raise funds to join Thay on this tour, but the cost of flying, and the disparity in the cost of living between there and Europe, makes the voyage difficult for all but a few.



We have since used some of these mindfulness practices with directors of high schools (Colegios de
Bachilleres de Chiapas COBAH) and some professors. I am sure that this is the way to begin watering the seeds, so that we can
go on working with indigenous girls and boys and adolescents. In this way we are going to carry
out what was discussed in the sharing circles on the 2014 Spain Tour about Wake Up Schools.  — Maria Marilu Jimenez Lopez, Chiapas, México


This Wake Up tour will bring Spanish-speaking Plum Village monks and nuns directly to five countries in Latin America: Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, Nicaragua and México. Instead of just a handful of people having access to these practices and teachings, the tour reaches out to thousands of people interested in Thay's teachings in these countries and gives them the opportunity to bring mindfulness practice into their families, schools, and communities.If we are able to surpass our goal of raising $37,000 for this tour we will also be able to invite filmmaker Wouter Verhoeven to join us to film the events of the tour, creating an invaluable set of Spanish video resources on the practices of Plum Village and Wake Up Schools. All donors to this campaign will additionally receive a link to the Wake Up Schools as-yet-unreleased film, filmed and edited by Wouter, called ""Happy Teachers Will Change the World."" We really need your help to plant these seeds. The travel costs of the tour alone are approximately $5,000 per monastic, and there are only a handful of dedicated volunteers in each country working with very little financial support. This tour could not be possible without donations from those of us in countries like the U.S. and Europe who are fortunate enough to have retreats and monastics nearby and accessible to us year-round.NOTE: The organizing team in Nicaragua has arranged with local tree-planting ecologists, who will attend the retreat in Managua, to plant 500 trees in the Bosawás Biosphere Reserve as a carbon-offset to the air travel from the tour.Here are some highlights of the tour as it stands now:Chile(21-30 of September, 2014)

What is Vivir Despiertos (Wake Up)?
Wake Up is an active global community of young mindfulness practitioners, both monastic and lay, inspired by the teachings of Zen Master and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh. We come together to practice mindfulness in order to take care of ourselves, nourish happiness and contribute to building a healthier and a more compassionate society.
We want to help our world which is overloaded with intolerance, discrimination, craving, anger and despair. Seeing the environmental degradation caused by our society, we want to live in such a way that our planet Earth can survive for a long time.
Practicing mindfulness, concentration and insight enables us to cultivate tolerance, non-discrimination, understanding and compassion in ourselves and the world.


Our Practice
We follow the Five Mindfulness Trainings, which are ethical guidelines that offer concrete practices of true love and compassion, and a path towards a life in harmony with each other and the Earth. These guidelines are the foundation of our lives and represent our ideal of service.
Our practice is based on cultivating awareness of the breath and living deeply in the present moment, aware of what is happening within us and around us. This practice helps us to release the tension in our bodies and feelings, to live life deeply and more happily, and to use compassionate listening and loving speech to help restore communication and reconcile with others.
Roots of Wake Up: Inclusiveness
The Wake Up movement is inspired by Buddhism’s long tradition of wisdom and practices which help cultivate understanding and love; it is not based on beliefs or ideology. The spirit of our practice is close to the spirit of science; both help us cultivate an open and non-discriminating mind. We honor everyone’s diverse spiritual and cultural roots. You can join as a Christian, a Jew, a Muslim, as an agnostic or atheist, or member of any other spiritual or religious tradition.
What We Do
We aspire to be a place of refuge, nourishment and support for anyone with an aspiration to transform their own suffering and contribute to a healthy and compassionate society. We gather weekly or monthly in Wake Up groups to practice sitting and walking meditation, to listen to a teaching, practice total relaxation, listen deeply to one another, and recite the Five Mindfulness Trainings.
We also organize mindfulness events and retreats on Wake Up Tours like this one.

La Gira Vivir Despiertos en América Latina
Te pedimos ahora tu acción.
Tu donación, que puede ser deducible de impuestos en los E.E.U.U., hará posible que siete monásticos de Plum Village, Maestros del Dharma y discípulos del Maestro Zen Thich Nhat Hanh puedan presentar a miles de niños, jóvenes, activistas, maestros y profesores y tantos otros más, la práctica de la plena conciencia y del despertar, a través de retiros, Jornadas de Plena Conciencia para Educadores, Eventos de Vivir Despiertos para los jóvenes con charlas públicas en Santiago, Chile; Quito, Ecuador; Bogotá, Colombia; Managua, Nicaragua; y Ciudad de México, México, en ésta primavera desde el 21 de Septiembre al 04 de Noviembre de 2014.


Necesitamos entrenar miles de maestros conscientes, decenas de miles de maestros, porque en todo lugar se necesita la práctica de la plena conciencia. — Thich Nhat Hanh

Durante los últimos veinte años las enseñanzas de Thich Nhat Hanh y de Plum Village se han ido expandiendo lentamente a través del mundo hispano-hablante, en la medida en que sus libros han comenzado a ser traducidos del Inglés al Español. En los últimos seis años mucho material se ha compartido también bajo la forma de videos subtitulados de las charlas del Dharma y también grabaciones en audio de sus traducciones.


Este año, 2014, ha sido un punto de inflexión: el fino hilo de agua nos ha inundado. Thich Nhat Hanh y 57 de sus discípulos monásticos desembarcaron en Madrid, España, el 25 de Abril, para dar inicio a la primera gira de Plum Village en un país hispanohablante. Un puñado de practicantes Latinoamericanos muy dedicados fueron capaces de juntar los fondos necesarios para acompañar a Thay en ésta gira, pero el costo de viajar en avión, la disparidad del costo de vida entre América Latina y Europa, hizo que ese viaje fuera muy difícil para la gran mayoría, y apenas unos pocos pudieron afrontarlo.



Ya hemos utilizado algunas de las prácticas de la plena conciencia con directores de las escuelas secundarias (Colegios de Bachilleres de Chiapas COBAH) y también con algunos profesores. Estoy segura que ésta es la manera de comenzar a regar las semillas, para así poder continuar trabajando con niños y niñas y adolescentes indígenas. De ésta forma podremos llevar adelante lo que fue discutido en nuestras rondas de intercambio y compartir durante la Gira Española de 2014, sobre el tema de las Escuelas Despiertas. — Maria Marilu Jimenez Lopez, Chiapas, México

Esta Gira de Vivir Despiertos (Wake Up) nos traerá un grupo de siete monásticos hispano-hablantes de Plum Village, quienes vendrán a cinco países de Latinoamérica: Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, Nicaragua y México. Esta Gira permitirá tener acceso a las enseñanzas y prácticas, ya no solo a unos pocos sino a millares de personas interesadas en las enseñanzas de Thay en todos éstos países, brindándoles la oportunidad de acercar la práctica de la plena conciencia a sus familias, escuelas y toda su comunidad.


Realmente necesitamos tu ayuda para plantar ésta semillas. Los costos de  viaje de la Gira son sustancialmente altos; hay apenas un puñado de voluntarios en cada país y tienen poca ayuda financiera. Esta gira no sería posible sin las donaciones de aquellos que vivimos en países como los Estados Unidos, Cánada, o países de Europa que son lo suficientemente afortunados como para tener los retiros de Thay y a los monásticos geográficamente cerca y accesibles a lo largo de todo el año.
Aquí abajo destacamos algunos puntos de la Gira, según está diagramado hoy día:

Que es Vivir Despiertos (Wake Up)?
Vivir Despiertos (Wake Up) es una comunidad global de jóvenes practicantes de la plena conciencia inspirados en las enseñanzas del Maestro Zen y activista de la Paz, Thich Nhat Hanh. Nos reunimos para practicar la plena conciencia para así nutrir nuestra felicidad, cuidar de nosotros mismos y ayudar a construir una sociedad más sana y compasiva.
Queremos ayudar y mejorar nuestro mundo actual tan cargado de intolerancia, discriminación, adicciones, ira y desesperación. Atentos a la degradación del medio ambiente causada por nuestra sociedad, queremos vivir de una manera tal que ayudemos a nuestro planeta Tierra a existir por mucho más tiempo.
La práctica de mindfulness o plena conciencia, de la concentración y de la visión profunda nos permite cultivar la tolerancia, la comprensión y la compasión, en nosotros mismos y en el mundo.
Nuestra práctica
Estudiamos y practicamos Los Cinco Entrenamientos de la Plena Conciencia, que son una guía ética que nos ofrece prácticas concretas sobre el verdadero amor y la compasión, y un camino para vivir en armonía entre todos y con nuestro planeta. Esta Guía son la base sobre la que vivimos nuestras vidas y representan nuestra ideal de servicio para con la sociedad.
Las raíces de Vivir Despiertos: Inclusividad
El movimiento de Vivir Despiertos está inspirado en la larga tradición Budista de sabiduría y prácticas que ayudan a cultivar la comprensión y el amor; no se basa en creencias o ideologías. El espíritu de nuestra práctica se acerca al espíritu de la ciencia; ambos nos ayudan a cultivar una mente abierta y no discriminatoria. Aceptamos y honramos las raíces culturales y espirituales de todos. Puedes acercarte siendo cristiano, judío, musulmán, agnóstico o ateo, o siendo miembro de cualquier otra tradición espiritual o religiosa.
Que hacemos
Aspiramos a ser un lugar de refugio, que nutra y dé soporte a cualquiera que tenga la aspiración de transformar su propio sufrimiento y de contribuir para tener una sociedad mas sana y compasiva. Con nuestros grupos de Vivir Despiertos, nos reunimos periódicamente, semanal, quincenal o mensualmente, para practicar la meditación sentados y también caminando, escuchar las Enseñanzas, practicar la relajación total, escucharnos unos a otros con profunda atención y para recitar juntos Los Cinco Entrenamientos de la Plena Conciencia.
También organizamos eventos y/o retiros de Plena Conciencia en nuestras giras de Vivir Despiertos, como es ésta.

Murrow</h3><h3>""Words are the voice of the heart.""  -- Confucius</h3><p>Having a strong vocabulary is beneficial in so many ways. Not only does it empower students to excel on challenging tests such as the SAT, GRE, and LSAT; but it also gives one authority, <b>the power to communicate effectively and comprehend thoroughly</b>.</p><p>The <b>Memory-Flash Vocab Learning System</b> (patent pending) is the culmination of my 15 years as a teacher of English Enrichment and as a tutor and curriculum creator for ACT, SAT, and GRE tests. In my efforts to enhance students' English abilities and prepare them for successful academic careers, I have faced the formidable challenge of teaching hundreds of difficult words in often short periods of time.</p><p>The most effective strategy I have discovered is <b>a focus on mnemonics and association</b>, particularly through the study of <b>prefixes, root words, and synonyms</b>. Developing a knowledge of the connections between words enables one to<b> learn several words simultaneously rather than simply one at a time</b>. Furthermore, this system of learning<b> makes use of the </b><a href=""http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~ashas/Cognition%20Textbook/chapter5.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">brain's natural technique for making long-term memories, the associative process known as consolidation</a>.</p><h2><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Our Goals for the Memory-Flash Learning System and for ACI Publishing</span></h2><p>For over 25 years, ACI has been <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">mostly</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">a local business, serving students' needs in the San Gabriel area of Los Angeles.  In my role as curriculum coordinator, however, I've always thought that the insightful and innovative materials I've created for the company could <b>serve a greater good by educating students all around the world</b>.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We are beginning our campaign modestly, seeking to secure enough capital to spend on </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">marketing our Memory Flash Learning System so that we can distribute to a much wider audience</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">.

The cards utilize our <b>patent pending system of symbols, associations, and memory triggers</b> to enable you to learn quicker and form a lasting body of linguistic knowledge. </p><p>With regular Flash Cards and even with high-tech vocabulary websites and phone apps, the process is the same.

Most people think the word on the left means ""related to torture,"" but not so fast! Check out the clues: <b>RED underlining indicates a definition is similar in look or sound</b> to the underlined part, so it is actually the word on the right that is related to torture. Meanwhile, the <b>BLUE underlining indicates the root word</b> ""tort,"" which means ""twist,"" as in words like ""contort"" or ""distort."" Thus, the word on the left means ""twisting,"" as in a tortuous mountain road.</p><p style="""">I would assert that one could learn and know the definitions to two words such as these <u>simply through the associative clues and an understanding of our system of symbols</u>. The card backs do present a thorough yet simply-worded definition along with a context sentence, but <b>it is the associations and connections between words that provide the fastest path to increasing one's vocabulary</b>.</p><p style="""">With that in mind, I have also designed an <b>exclusive set of Study Guides as a suitable complement to our Memory-Flash Vocab Cards</b>. These laminated guides are dense with information and will fit perfectly in any 3-ring binder as a constant reminder of hundreds of challenging words.

It is suggested that one keep a small notebook to keep track of the words one is learning, using simple definitions and mnemonic clues when possible. Once a student starts to learn the words on the Study Guides, <b>it will become apparent how words are connected together, either by their prefixes, roots, or synonymous meanings, reinforcing the definitions and increasing memory retention</b>.</p><p>Furthermore, many of the words are also part of Set A of our Memory-Flash Vocab Cards, so <b>a more scrupulous student with greater aspirations of scholarship would aim for one of the higher tiers of support:</b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/446348/files/20140319185913-Tier_3-4.png?1395280753"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/446393/files/20140319191821-Tier_5.png?1395281901"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p align=""center""><b>(Shipping is included with all perks. <br/>For International shipping, add $15 for Tier 1-5 perks.)</b></p><p align=""center""><b>Before you decide on a perk, check out the additional Tiers below <br/></b><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">to help us reach our Stretch Goals!</b></p><p align=""center""><b><br/></b></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Our Stretch Goals for the Truly Studious!</span><br/></p><p><b>In addition to all the coming changes to the school system brought on by the Common Core Initiative, the College Board recently dropped a bombshell: the most dramatic changes to the SAT test, perhaps ever!</b></p><p>At ACI, we have always prided ourselves on <b>our ability to create original study materials and practice tests that closely match the difficulty level and expectations of actual SAT tests</b>.

One's vocabulary needs constant fertilizing or it will die."" -- Evelyn Waugh</h1><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>","""Learn your language well and command it well, and you will have the first component to life.""  -- Edward R. Murrow""Words are the voice of the heart.""  -- ConfuciusHaving a strong vocabulary is beneficial in so many ways. Not only does it empower students to excel on challenging tests such as the SAT, GRE, and LSAT; but it also gives one authority, the power to communicate effectively and comprehend thoroughly.The Memory-Flash Vocab Learning System (patent pending) is the culmination of my 15 years as a teacher of English Enrichment and as a tutor and curriculum creator for ACT, SAT, and GRE tests. In my efforts to enhance students' English abilities and prepare them for successful academic careers, I have faced the formidable challenge of teaching hundreds of difficult words in often short periods of time.The most effective strategy I have discovered is a focus on mnemonics and association, particularly through the study of prefixes, root words, and synonyms. Developing a knowledge of the connections between words enables one to learn several words simultaneously rather than simply one at a time. Furthermore, this system of learning makes use of the brain's natural technique for making long-term memories, the associative process known as consolidation.Our Goals for the Memory-Flash Learning System and for ACI PublishingFor over 25 years, ACI has been mostly a local business, serving students' needs in the San Gabriel area of Los Angeles.  In my role as curriculum coordinator, however, I've always thought that the insightful and innovative materials I've created for the company could serve a greater good by educating students all around the world.We are beginning our campaign modestly, seeking to secure enough capital to spend on marketing our Memory Flash Learning System so that we can distribute to a much wider audience. We also seek to garner recognition and interest in our product through the unique approach that crowdfunding and social media offer.Finally, we hope that the response to our educational tools is so strong that we will reach our stretch goals and be able to produce and publish our next two projects: Set B of our Memory-Flash Vocab Cards and an Exclusive Guide to the NEW SAT.The Benefits to YOU for Your SupportMost levels of support will receive a box of our Memory-Flash Vocab Cards. The 500 words in Set A are all Essential vocabulary useful for a variety of situations, from academic testing to personal betterment. The cards utilize our patent pending system of symbols, associations, and memory triggers to enable you to learn quicker and form a lasting body of linguistic knowledge. With regular Flash Cards and even with high-tech vocabulary websites and phone apps, the process is the same. You look at the word, try to remember it, then you look at the definition. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Certainly, repetition is an essential component to learning. HOWEVER, with the Memory-Flash system, you learn the way your brain is designed to learn, by building a network of associations. Almost every card has a symbol on the front intended to trigger an associative clue, empowering you to recall each word more efficiently.You can find more detailed information at our initial promotional website, but here are two examples to illustrate some fundamental concepts of the Memory-Flash system. = warning! commonly confused words or other tricky situation = prefix or root word = aural (sound) or visual clueWith these two cards, we obviously have a pair of tricky words, words that are easily confused with each other, as indicated by the red octagon. Most people think the word on the left means ""related to torture,"" but not so fast! Check out the clues: RED underlining indicates a definition is similar in look or sound to the underlined part, so it is actually the word on the right that is related to torture. Meanwhile, the BLUE underlining indicates the root word ""tort,"" which means ""twist,"" as in words like ""contort"" or ""distort."" Thus, the word on the left means ""twisting,"" as in a tortuous mountain road.I would assert that one could learn and know the definitions to two words such as these simply through the associative clues and an understanding of our system of symbols. The card backs do present a thorough yet simply-worded definition along with a context sentence, but it is the associations and connections between words that provide the fastest path to increasing one's vocabulary.With that in mind, I have also designed an exclusive set of Study Guides as a suitable complement to our Memory-Flash Vocab Cards. These laminated guides are dense with information and will fit perfectly in any 3-ring binder as a constant reminder of hundreds of challenging words. At least one Memory-Flash Study Guide comes as a perk with every level of support.The Study Guides do not provide the definitions for the words, so some research is required of the student. It is suggested that one keep a small notebook to keep track of the words one is learning, using simple definitions and mnemonic clues when possible. Once a student starts to learn the words on the Study Guides, it will become apparent how words are connected together, either by their prefixes, roots, or synonymous meanings, reinforcing the definitions and increasing memory retention.Furthermore, many of the words are also part of Set A of our Memory-Flash Vocab Cards, so a more scrupulous student with greater aspirations of scholarship would aim for one of the higher tiers of support:(Shipping is included with all perks. For International shipping, add $15 for Tier 1-5 perks.)Before you decide on a perk, check out the additional Tiers below to help us reach our Stretch Goals!Our Stretch Goals for the Truly Studious!In addition to all the coming changes to the school system brought on by the Common Core Initiative, the College Board recently dropped a bombshell: the most dramatic changes to the SAT test, perhaps ever!At ACI, we have always prided ourselves on our ability to create original study materials and practice tests that closely match the difficulty level and expectations of actual SAT tests. As soon as the College Board releases more information, we will be hard at work creating a curriculum to help students prepare for this newest version of the SAT test. As part of our goals of expanding our publication department, we intend to make a test prep book available to students everywhere, the Ultimate Guide to the NEW SAT!Overall, we are hoping for a strong response to our Memory-Flash system. Certainly, if there is widespread interest, we will be investing in the production of Set B of our Memory-Flash Vocab Flash Cards! 500 additional words, again using our patent pending system of symbols, associations, and memory triggers! As excited as we are to create Set B, we can only hope you're just as excited and will help us meet this second stretch goal to offset the rather exorbitant printing costs.NOTE: If we do reach our second stretch goal, anyone who is getting a box of Memory-Flash Vocab Cards as a perk can specify whether to receive Set A or Set B!!!We hope many people will see the value of our learning systems and will be interested in helping us reach these publication goals, enabling ACI Publishing to gain a strong, initial foundation in the field of educational publishing. Perhaps, however, you are just interested in obtaining either of these products as a perk. In either case, your best option is to go for one of our advanced tiers:(Shipping is included with all perks.

</p><p>The UnityWorks Foundation
is a nonprofit on a mission to promote an understanding of the oneness of humanity,
the value of diversity and the need for unity. We provide training, materials
and support to empower local communities to raise prejudice-free children, and
encourage schools to develop learning environments where students from all backgrounds
can be successful. We hope to grow our startup organization into a national
force, with programs in multiple cities, helping thousands of teachers and
students to learn about unity in diversity.<br/></p>Our UnityWorks School Program
is designed to educate staff and students about living in a diverse society, to
promote culturally-responsive teaching, to increase equity and reduce
prejudice, to improve race relations, to close achievement and opportunity
gaps, and to encourage positive multicultural change.<br/><br/><p>


We plan
to launch this fall in Yakima, Washington, beginning with an intensive Training Institute for local teachers.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/664677/files/20140621082237-schoolkids_-_-_from_Js_stock_photos_-_cropped.jpg?1403364157"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h4><b>Where did we get this idea?</b></h4><p>Have you
ever wondered, “Why can’t we all get along?” That was UnityWorks founder Dr.
Randie Gottlieb’s question. As a teacher educator and diversity trainer who has
worked and traveled in over 30 countries, she encountered far too many examples
of prejudice and discrimination around the world. Instead of becoming dis<b>c</b>ouraged, she decided to devote her
efforts to bringing about greater understanding, unity and justice—beginning
with our teachers and our schools. <br/></p><p>She found that educators had little training and
confidence in this area, and were unsure of how to deal with issues of race,
gender, class, or other dimensions of diversity. So Dr. Gottlieb and a small
team of like-minded individuals established the UnityWorks Foundation to address
these issues in a positive and inclusive manner. We chose the name “UnityWorks”
because it does! </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/800683/files/20140820092321-UWF_Logo_MASTER_72ppi.png?1408551801"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">Award-winning

<p>The UnityWorks School Program is based on the award-winning EMPIRE Program, for which Dr.
Gottlieb served as Executive Director for over a decade. EMPIRE (Exemplary
Multicultural Practices in Rural Education) was a consortium of K-12 schools, businesses
and community groups in Washington State that had joined together in a
collaborative network to encourage positive multicultural change. </p>
<p>Rather than asking the
schools to implement a series of standardized multicultural directives from
above, EMPIRE offered pro-active leadership with a grassroots approach that
empowered site teams at each school to design and implement their own agendas for
change. </p>
<p>As a result of the
notable success achieved by the participating schools, EMPIRE was highlighted
as a model program by President Clinton's National Initiative on Race; received
the Year 2000 Best Program Award from the National Association for Multicultural
Education; and was honored with the Washington State Golden Apple Award for
Excellence in Education.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/634867/files/20140608200006-EMPIRE_LT.jpg?1402282806"" src="""" style=""width: 463.761px; height: 321px;""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">
</span></p><p>Because of their efforts,
site teams reported that discipline referrals had declined, long-standing
stereotypes were breaking down, cross-race friendships had formed, members of
rival groups were working and playing together for the first time, student
attendance and motivation had increased, parent involvement more than tripled,
and community relations were greatly improved. </p>

teachers said</b></p><p><u>Kathleen</u>: “It's been really fun and
successful for me to incorporate diversity ideas into my classroom. The kids
love it too. We're talking about human relationships and the students are
beginning to change their words and their actions.”</p>
<p><u>Ruben</u>: “I now feel a responsibility as a
teacher. I am driven to examine my own instructional methods and my own
behavior.”</p>
<p><u>Heriberto</u>: “I am becoming aware of my own
prejudices. I thought that I was aware, since I myself have been a victim of
racial discrimination. But we cannot ignore prejudice. We must help eradicate
it by starting with ourselves.” </p>
<p><u>Rebecca</u>: “I used to think that one voice
did not make an impact, but that has changed. I believe that we will be able to bring this message of
understanding to our own schools, our families, our communities.”

unity? </b></p><p>The human race faces many difficult challenges
including widespread poverty, malnutrition, war, disease, climate change,
economic instability, gender inequality and deep-rooted prejudices. Racial
prejudice is particularly damaging. Although great strides have been made, it
still pervades the institutions of our society and holds a strong grip on
individual hearts and minds. Many
children already hold negative stereotypes of other racial and ethnic groups by
the time they enter first grade. </p>

each of these issues separately, UnityWorks believes that they are only pieces
of a larger puzzle— symptoms of the primary disease afflicting society: the disunity of the human race. We believe that
a fragmented approach is itself part of the problem, and that unity is a prerequisite for achieving
the well-being, peace and security of all the earth’s inhabitants. As a united
humanity, we will have the capacity to develop positive and sustainable
solutions to the challenges facing us, and provide a firm foundation on which
to build a prosperous and peaceful world.
</p><h4><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><b></b></b></h4><p><b>Why schools?</b></p><p>Learning about unity
and overcoming prejudice should not be considered optional add-ons to the
curriculum. Rather, they are a critical part of the education of every child. Working
with schools has a multiplier effect, since a single teacher can reach
thousands of students, and these young people will then influence
every sector of society.</p>

<p></p></div>","Join us in launching our Pilot Program! 


The UnityWorks Foundation
is a nonprofit on a mission to promote an understanding of the oneness of humanity,
the value of diversity and the need for unity. We provide training, materials
and support to empower local communities to raise prejudice-free children, and
encourage schools to develop learning environments where students from all backgrounds
can be successful. We hope to grow our startup organization into a national
force, with programs in multiple cities, helping thousands of teachers and
students to learn about unity in diversity.Our UnityWorks School Program
is designed to educate staff and students about living in a diverse society, to
promote culturally-responsive teaching, to increase equity and reduce
prejudice, to improve race relations, to close achievement and opportunity
gaps, and to encourage positive multicultural change.


We plan
to launch this fall in Yakima, Washington, beginning with an intensive Training Institute for local teachers.Where did we get this idea?Have you
ever wondered, “Why can’t we all get along?” That was UnityWorks founder Dr.
Randie Gottlieb’s question. As a teacher educator and diversity trainer who has
worked and traveled in over 30 countries, she encountered far too many examples
of prejudice and discrimination around the world. Instead of becoming discouraged, she decided to devote her
efforts to bringing about greater understanding, unity and justice—beginning
with our teachers and our schools. She found that educators had little training and
confidence in this area, and were unsure of how to deal with issues of race,
gender, class, or other dimensions of diversity. So Dr. Gottlieb and a small
team of like-minded individuals established the UnityWorks Foundation to address
these issues in a positive and inclusive manner. We chose the name “UnityWorks”
because it does! Award-winning
model
The UnityWorks School Program is based on the award-winning EMPIRE Program, for which Dr.
Gottlieb served as Executive Director for over a decade. EMPIRE (Exemplary
Multicultural Practices in Rural Education) was a consortium of K-12 schools, businesses
and community groups in Washington State that had joined together in a
collaborative network to encourage positive multicultural change. 
Rather than asking the
schools to implement a series of standardized multicultural directives from
above, EMPIRE offered pro-active leadership with a grassroots approach that
empowered site teams at each school to design and implement their own agendas for
change. 
As a result of the
notable success achieved by the participating schools, EMPIRE was highlighted
as a model program by President Clinton's National Initiative on Race; received
the Year 2000 Best Program Award from the National Association for Multicultural
Education; and was honored with the Washington State Golden Apple Award for
Excellence in Education.
Because of their efforts,
site teams reported that discipline referrals had declined, long-standing
stereotypes were breaking down, cross-race friendships had formed, members of
rival groups were working and playing together for the first time, student
attendance and motivation had increased, parent involvement more than tripled,
and community relations were greatly improved. 
What the
teachers saidKathleen: “It's been really fun and
successful for me to incorporate diversity ideas into my classroom. The kids
love it too. We're talking about human relationships and the students are
beginning to change their words and their actions.”
Ruben: “I now feel a responsibility as a
teacher. I am driven to examine my own instructional methods and my own
behavior.”
Heriberto: “I am becoming aware of my own
prejudices. I thought that I was aware, since I myself have been a victim of
racial discrimination. But we cannot ignore prejudice. We must help eradicate
it by starting with ourselves.” 
Rebecca: “I used to think that one voice
did not make an impact, but that has changed. I believe that we will be able to bring this message of
understanding to our own schools, our families, our communities.”
Why
unity? The human race faces many difficult challenges
including widespread poverty, malnutrition, war, disease, climate change,
economic instability, gender inequality and deep-rooted prejudices. Racial
prejudice is particularly damaging. Although great strides have been made, it
still pervades the institutions of our society and holds a strong grip on
individual hearts and minds. Many
children already hold negative stereotypes of other racial and ethnic groups by
the time they enter first grade. 
While we might make some progress addressing
each of these issues separately, UnityWorks believes that they are only pieces
of a larger puzzle— symptoms of the primary disease afflicting society: the disunity of the human race. We believe that
a fragmented approach is itself part of the problem, and that unity is a prerequisite for achieving
the well-being, peace and security of all the earth’s inhabitants. As a united
humanity, we will have the capacity to develop positive and sustainable
solutions to the challenges facing us, and provide a firm foundation on which
to build a prosperous and peaceful world.
Why schools?Learning about unity
and overcoming prejudice should not be considered optional add-ons to the
curriculum. Rather, they are a critical part of the education of every child. Working
with schools has a multiplier effect, since a single teacher can reach
thousands of students, and these young people will then influence
every sector of society.
“While realizing
that we cannot entirely solve the problems which exist between cultures, we
also realize that somebody has to start somewhere—starting with ourselves as
individuals, spreading to our school and ultimately to our community.” (School
District Superintendent)What have we
done so far?Our first UnityWorks PowerPoint series for school
children (on the topics of Unity, Diversity, Skin Colors and Overcoming
Prejudice) has been downloaded over 500 times. Our recently-published 300-page
activity book on Teaching Unity is already being used by educators in 18
countries -- including China, with over 8,000 public school children as part of
the World Ambassador Program in Shanghai.
The book was also honored in 2013 as an IP Notable
by Independent Publisher Magazine, which called it “a title of distinction…As important as the ABCs and the 123s.” And
in May 2014, Teaching Unity was named a Finalist in the Education/Academic
category for both the Next Generation Book Awards and the National Indie
Excellence Awards.
Next stepsOur next goal is to establish
a UnityWorks School Program in Yakima, Washington during the 2014-15 school
year—providing diversity training, educational materials and ongoing support to
site teams at several local schools. 
We have recruited a diverse and experienced local volunteer board to coordinate this effort,
and are in the process of enrolling interested schools. We will also design the curriculum for a 30-hour intensive Teacher Training Institute this Fall; create the instructional materials for
that training; and plan a follow-up conference for site teams in the spring.

The Training Institute will help prepare educators
with essential knowledge, practical skills, and specific strategies needed to
help them design and implement successful projects in their own classrooms and
schools. Hands-on interactive workshops will include sessions on: 
Dimensions of Diversity

Multiple Perspectives in the Curriculum
Culture and Communication
The Reality of Race 
Bullying and Biased Remarks
Equity, Expectations and Student Achievement
The Power of Language
Prejudice, Power and Privilege
Role of Whites in a Multicultural Society
Creating an Action Plan
The UnityWorks Training Institute
will become an annual event open to new site teams who are ready to launch the Program at their own schools. With experience and an established model, we’ll move
forward with plans to expand to additional cities across the United States and beyond.
What will the funds be used for? 
Our plan is to build a scalable model that will
serve as the basis for a nationwide program. This campaign is in support of Phase 1, which has five primary goals.
Five primary goals:

Design and carry out an intensive 30-hour Training Institute for up to 40 teachers (including trainer fees, guest speakers, facility rental, books, equipment, refreshments and supplies).
Develop the curriculum and all training materials, including PowerPoints and handouts.

Create a website, brochures and other promotional materials to assist in recruiting schools.

Provide seed funding for the initial site team projects at each school.
Hold a spring conference to provide an opportunity for teams to report on their challenges and successes, evaluate their efforts, share best practices, and make plans for the following year.

The funds will also be
used to cover the costs of site visits and ongoing administrative support. 
If we exceed our funding
goal for the current school year, we plan to use the additional money to provide teachers with
college credits or continuing education clock hours for the training.
Risks and challenges
As with any new school-based program, we will need
to work around existing schedules, availability of funds and personnel,
and other challenges that might affect our delivery dates, but we will do everything we can to complete each task
well and on time.

</div></div>","Become part of history by funding the #SAVETHESLIPPERS campaign and help find out what happened to the missing Ruby Slippers, stolen in 2005.
A pair of the Ruby Slippers are missing.


The case remains open.
Hi, I'm filmmaker Morgan White. For the past two years I've been documenting the unbelievable story of the Ruby Slippers from The Wizard of Oz for my upcoming film, The Slippers, set to be released next year. Now I want you to be a part of their amazing story with the #SAVETHESLIPPERS campaign, by helping to raise the funds necessary to solve the case of the missing pair.
Four pairs of Ruby Slippers that were used in the 1939 MGM classic film The Wizard of Oz are known to exist. They are among the most important pieces of Hollywood memorabilia, worth millions of dollars, and were worn by legendary star Judy Garland as she skipped down the yellow brick road in the film. One pair resides at The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, and has been on display for nearly 40 years, attracting millions each year. A second pair will be the centerpiece of The Academy Museum (AMPAS Museum) which is set to open to the public in Los Angeles, CA, in 2017. The third pair is privately owned, locked away in a bank vault where no one can see them. As for the fourth pair...

Each year the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, birthplace of Judy Garland, hosts a festival celebrating Judy and the wonderful world of Oz, and noted Hollywood collector Michael Shaw had been lending his shoes to the museum for display during the festival. They drew in countless fans from all over the world.

But in 2005 the shoes went missing...

On August 28th, 2005, someone broke into the Judy Garland Museum and stole the authentic pair of Ruby Slippers that were on display. The case was investigated by the local police, who came to no conclusions, and as time went on the case went cold...


Now 10 years later...


Minneapolis based Alexander & Associates, a private investigation company who specializes in cold cases, was brought in to save the Ruby Slippers. The investigators are close to solving the case once and for all, but we need your help to raise the funds necessary to complete the final critical stages of the investigation before the case goes cold again. All funds raised will go directly to the investigation.


The investigation requires a further $45,000 to help solve the case.
You can be a part of this historic effort to #SAVETHESLIPPERS.




The Ruby Slippers are considered to be the most important piece of Hollywood memorabilia, and are a totem for millions of fans all over the world. The most recent sale put their value at over 2 million dollars per pair, and that value will continue to climb in the future.
When a pair of shoes were stolen from The Judy Garland Museum in 2005 it was considered a major art theft, but the case went cold. Over the past 10 years stories of their location have continued to circulate, leaving people, including their previous owner Michael Shaw, accused of a crime they did not commit. It is time to put a stop to all the stories, rumors, and hearsay. Let's find the shoes once and for all!

in the community of Desab, in Haiti, and to educate the school’s students about
the importance of clean water. The village we will be working in consists primarily
of farmhouses, a small clinic, and a rundown school. Our work will benefit the
300+ children who attend the school, many of whom suffer from malnutrition due to a lack of clean water supply. Desab is very much
in need of support and we are excited to make a difference!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>
<p>As you might imagine, our trip requires a tremendous amount of funding. Although we have made a good start raising money so far, we still need a lot of support to make this trip happen. Any size donation would be appreciated, as we aim to raise around $ 15,000 in total. We are extremely grateful for your support! <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>In a nation such as Haiti, education is the key to success. Especially in the countryside, a strong education is difficult to come by - which makes school facilities all the more valuable for children living in rural areas. By providing the students attending school in Desab with a new classroom in which they can learn and thrive, we hope to truly make a difference. <br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> On this service trip, we will be immersing ourselves in an entirely new culture. The village of Desab is about as rural as you can get, with outdoor community showers, primitive outhouses, and no internet nor outside contact of any kind. Part of what will make this experience so incredible is that we are going to have to adapt to new situations and go without all the modern technology we take for granted in our daily lives.<br/></p>

<p><b>THE STORY</b></p>
<p>My name
is Ren Morrison and I am the Director of Community Programs for Atlantic Center
for the Arts (ACA). ACA is a nonprofit interdisciplinary artists' community and
arts education facility dedicated to promoting artistic excellence for over thirty-eight
years.</p>
<p>I run
many programs, but, by far, the one most important to me is our <b><i>your
word</i></b> teen writing residency. Created more than eight years ago by poet
and author Kelle Groom and myself, <i>your
word</i> is a two-week, immersive writing residency that takes place at ACA’s
world class facilities located in a pristine, Florida woodlands setting.</p>
<p>The
residency brings together teen writers from all over the country and provides
them with the unique experience of working with well-published Master Writers
of different genres. Each writer is given their own room and the space and
freedom to explore the breadth of their creativity. The residency is a
transformative experience not only in regards to writing, but also in regards
to how the teens are treated—they are treated as equals, as adults.</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>For the
majority of years the residency has been in existence we enjoyed the financial
support of a foundation. This support allowed us to give out many scholarships
to teens who would otherwise be unable to attend. The term of this funding
ended a year ago and so did our ability to provide scholarships to those in
need.</p>
<p>We need
your scholarship donations to maintain the kind of diversity, socio-economic
and otherwise, that we have been striving for from day one. Last year this
campaign provided scholarships for three inner-city teens from Cleveland and
Milwaukee, and this year we would like to double that. Our $12,000 goal will
allow us to give out six full scholarships to talented teen writers of color (African
American and Hispanic). </p>
<p>If we
don’t reach our goal of $12,000, any funds raised will be used to provide as
much assistance as possible.</p>
<p><b>THE IMPACT</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Surrounded
by a residency staff of which about 90% are writers, the teens are exposed to writers who are at various stages of their careers (recent
graduates, grad students, emerging writers, and established writers). This
gives the teens access to writers of various experience levels and allows them to
see that pursuing their passion for writing is a viable career option. Also important is the community that quickly develops among the teens, a community the teens can and do draw upon long after they've left the residency. Without question, the <i>your word </i>residency is a transformative experience for young writers.</p>
<p><b>Any amount you can donate
will help, and whether you can or can’t donate, please share this campaign with
as many people as you can. Indiegogo has share tools to help you with this.</b></p>

When he was 9 days old his parents learned that he has Joubert Syndrome (JS), a very rare neurological birth defect that affects about 1 in 100,000 children. JS can cause low muscle tone, intellectual disabilities, altered breathing patterns, ataxia/poor muscle coordination, global developments delay, vision issues, GI issues and additional medical complications. Coltrane is 2 years old and works hard everyday at learning how to walk, talk, and eat like his peers. He receives Occupational, Speech, Physical, and Vision Therapy as well as Early Intervention services. He excels at sorting match box cars, painting pictures, singing, flipping through books, and charming the heck out of everyone he meets. </p><p>Joubert Syndrome is very rare, it affects about 0.00001% of the American population.

has been a memorable experience unlike any other, and we want to encourage the
administrative team to make this the best event possible. FreeCon has always
been an event for fans by fans, and we want to make it stand out not only as an
annual Tallahassee event, but as a free college run convention. Most of all, we
hope that all of you will get the most of out FreeCon and enjoy every moment of
the experience. <span><span><span><span>This convention means a lot to us, and your donations will be greatly appreciated.</span></span></span></span></p>

returning for its eleventh year, and we would like to invite you to contribute
to FreeCon through crowdfunding. We have been working tirelessly for the past
eight months to create a large scale event that has a unique story, characters,
and interactive events that will make your experience one to remember. Of
course, with such big plans, we cannot do it alone.
Right now we are looking at some
high-profile media guests, quality programming, and equipment necessary to make
it all happen. In years past, we have utilized funding granted by our university and from our own pockets. However, with such quality programming lined
up, this simply is not enough. With your support, we can bring everything we have planned to life.
As the new directors of FreeCon, we are
honored to carry on such a wonderful legacy. Inheriting this ambitious project
has been a memorable experience unlike any other, and we want to encourage the
administrative team to make this the best event possible. FreeCon has always
been an event for fans by fans, and we want to make it stand out not only as an
annual Tallahassee event, but as a free college run convention. Most of all, we
hope that all of you will get the most of out FreeCon and enjoy every moment of
the experience. This convention means a lot to us, and your donations will be greatly appreciated.


Amanda Ellard, Ginny Fouts, and Norma
Ortiz

FreeCon DirectorsFreeCon is an annual Japanese animation, science
fiction, video game, comic book, and enthusiast convention held in Tallahassee,
Florida. This year, two tribe leaders will face conflict greater than either of
them can overcome alone and discover:""The Truth Cannot Hide Forever""
FreeCon will be held at the Florida State University, a large venue we have been proud to call home for more than ten years.
Check out the Vendor Room and the Artist Alley, and get yourself some awesome
swag. The Costume Contest will also be returning this year, along with the AMV
contest, and a variety of other contests. Interact with fellow fans in a panel
and enjoy many more events!
Immerse yourself in the mystical tribes
of Oasis and Dune, and join this year's heroes, Ranzai and Ren, as they fight
to maintain the balance of their worlds. The quest for peace begins on
Saturday, March 28th and ends on Sunday, March 29th. Oasis and Dune will never
be the same, so take a stand with your tribe in the face of adversity!
As always, FreeCon is absolutely FREE to
attend. So don't miss your chance to try to change fate!Currently we are in contact with several Media Guests.
Although we cannot reveal who they are yet, we can promise that they are faces
that must be seen! Remember, the more funding we receive, the more guests we
can have.

Our quality programming doesn’t fund itself. Although our university covers some of our expenses, much of it is not. The more you contribute, the more equipment, materials, and prizes can be purchased to make the convention a better experience.
By contributing, you can receive the following perks:







Buttons Show your allegiance with these buttons featuring artwork of the FreeCon characters. 





Commissions A variety of artwork produced by our FreeCon Art Team at your request. A breakdown of all styles is listed below.





FreeCon T-Shirt FreeCon T-Shirts are extremely limited, and since 
they are free, they go pretty quickly. However, with this perk, we will 
keep one on hold for you. Just let us know the size shirt you would like
 to have after you donate.




Personalized Badge Name tags that feature the name of your choice on top of FreeCon graphics. These are available on the day of the convention.




Prints High
 quality limited 8½"" x 11"" prints printed on matte paper of official 
FreeCon artwork. Can be signed by the artist upon request.

However, if you get this perk, we'll be sure to save you a seat. See you
 at the Cafe!

Witness the epic of FreeCon: Genesis on your own personal DVD copy of
