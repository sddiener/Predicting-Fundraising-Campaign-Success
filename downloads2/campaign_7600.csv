<strong> </strong><h3>From Boston to Fogo Island <em>(a <em>short</em> history)</em>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<p>My name is M’Liz Keefe. I am a painter based in
Boston. Two years ago I embarked on a painting expedition to Newfoundland and
Labrador.<span>  I was accepted by an artist
residency program in the small historic fishing community of Tilting, Fogo
Island, off the north-eastern tip of Newfoundland. Since 2013 I have spent close
to 18 months painting on the Island.  I
have fallen in love with the land and the people and am profoundly inspired by
living and painting on the ocean in the raw, inhospitable world of the wild
North Atlantic. Working as a painter on the Island has been both a humbling
experience and an honor. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What I am doing and why I need your support</strong></p>
</div><div>
</div><p>
</p><div>
</div><p>
</p><p>This summer will be my 5th trip to Fogo Island.
 Beginning in July, I will begin an extensive project of 13 large-scale
paintings. Each oil painting will be 72 inches x 72 inches square (approx. 183 cm
x 183 cm), on stretched canvas. Each painting will represent one of the 11 historic
fishing communities on Fogo Island, a painting of nearby Change Islands and one
of Little Fogo Islands (abandoned through resettlement in the mid-20<sup>th</sup>
century). All of these communities (except for Little Fogo Islands) are still
thriving into the 21<sup>st</sup> century even after their 300-year-old
tradition of cod fishing was devastated by the Cod Moratorium of the 1990s. </p>
<p>Fogo Island is rich in cultural traditions, such as:
song, storytelling, music, poetry, quilting, knitting and utilitarian
woodworking. There has been little-known documentation of Fogo Island through
painting over the centuries, although there are now a few local artists—Winston
Osmond among others, whose dedication to depicting life on Fogo Island is
beginning to add to the storytelling traditions visually. </p>
<p>In the spirit of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Seven_(artists)"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>The
Group of Seven</u></a> in Canada, and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River_School"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Hudson River
School</u></a> in the United States, my project is devoted to the
landscape and the living history of Fogo Island in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
Through conversations and direction from the locals, I’ll choose what’s both
historically significant and thriving now into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Fogo
Island is an exciting place to be as it channels its survivalist spirit into creating
a vital cultural and historic destination for travelers from around the globe. </p><p>
</p><p>From my research, this may very well be the only
comprehensive and large scale group of paintings ever done that is solely
dedicated to the historic fishing communities of Fogo Island and Change Islands, one
of oldest, historically vital and significant outport communities of Newfoundland and
Labrador. </p>

I am planning a four-month stay on the Island July through October (fall being my favorite time of the year there) and aim to complete six of the thirteen paintings. I hope to have the group of thirteen paintings completed within 12-18 months, depending on my scheduled stays on Fogo Island throughout 2015-2016.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My doors will be open daily for locals and tourists to come in and experience the studio and appreciate the artwork, some conversation and a cup o’ tea in one of the most unique places on earth.

<p><b><u>A
Short History of Fogo Island</u></b></p>
<p>Fogo Island is the largest, most north-easterly island
off Newfoundland. As far back as the 1500s, the island was used by French and
Portuguese fishermen during summers because of the great abundance of cod in
its waters. English and Irish fishers were the first to create permanent
settlements on the island, in the 18th century.<span> 
</span></p>
<p>The Irish are said to have first wintered on the
Island in the community of Tilting, in 1752. Fogo Harbor and Tilting Harbor
were the first year-round settlements. Listening to many of the locals on the island
speak today, one can hear traces of Elizabethan English and Irish-speaking
dialects imparted to them across the generations. To this day, both Irish and
English descendants retain many of old customs, songs and dances from their
ancestral homelands.<span>  </span></p>
<p>In Tilting the Irish vernacular and Irish ways are
particularly distinctive. Tilting is a National Cultural Landscape District of
Canada and is Newfoundland and Labrador’s first Provincial Heritage District.
It is said to have the oldest Irish Cemetery in North America. By the 1780s it
became solely an Irish-Catholic community, and to this day is deeply rooted in
this tradition. </p>
<p>During the 1960s, the island, known as an outport, as
were all the old fishing communities of Newfoundland and Labrador, was
threatened with “resettlement” by the government because of economic
unsustainability.<span>  Resettlement meant
abandoning the island and resettling on the mainland. During that time the Fogo
Island Cooperative was born. The eleven fishing communities on the island joined
forces to save the fishing industry of the island.</span></p>
<p><i>In
1967, we had to make a life-altering decision on Fogo Island: Leave our beloved
island home and resettle on the mainland of Newfoundland and Labrador, or stay
and find a way to make it on our own. We stayed and we made it our own. To
ensure our survival, we turned to what we knew best for hundreds of years... the
sea.</i></p>
<p><i>Following
a process of community self-discovery, now known worldwide as the </i><a href=""http://www.nfb.ca/film/founding_of_the_cooperatives"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><u>Fogo
Process</u></i></a><i>,
our fishers formed the Fogo Island Co-operative Society, a community based
enterprise on which we built the economy of our island. We built more boats. We
built bigger boats. We took over processing facilities abandoned by private
enterprise. We built more plants. We sought new markets.</i><br/>
—The Co-op</p>
<p>By the 1990s, the cod stock in the Atlantic Ocean had
been over-fished and the North Atlantic cod fishing industry had collapsed. The
Cod Moratorium of 1992, which limited if not prevented commercial cod fishing
entirely, hit East Coast fishing communities hard—Newfoundland in particular.
Fogo Island was deeply impacted by the moratorium, as the islanders’ livelihood
and their 500-year connection to cod fishing disappeared overnight. </p>
<p>During the ensuing years the Island and the Co-op
turned to fishing for other types of seafood, including shrimp and the sea
cucumber, which they exported to Asian countries. By the 2000s the population
dropped to about 2,500 people from 6,000 in the 1960s. Fogo Island would once
again face “life-altering” decisions and need to reinvent itself for the 21st
century—this time through embracing eco-tourism and opening its arms to
travelers from across the globe. </p>
<p>Through the Shorefast Foundation, a not-for-profit
community-based organization founded by philanthropists and entrepreneur sister/brother
team Zita and Tony Cobb in the mid-2000s, the Fogo Island Inn was built. Fogo
Island has since become a destination for tourists from around the world.
Cottage industries are growing, including: small local farming, touring guides,
animal husbandry, gift shops, cafes and restaurants, even a coffee bean
roaster. Because of Artists residencies on the Island international artists,
musicians, and writers come year round to create their work and live among
their gracious hosts, the people of Fogo Island.<span>  </span></p>

Out of all the funding in Los Angeles county for the arts, only 2% goes to artists. TWO PERCENT. And it's been that way for decades. The rest goes for exhibition-making, schools, etc, but not to the actual people that make the actual art. Just to add to that, a 2003 survey by the Urban Institute found that 97% of people in the US value art as a concept, but only 27% value artists. Those that don't seem to experience a disconnect between living, working artists, and the objects that they appreciate, covet, and want in their homes and museums and on their city streets. As a population, artists are relatively low-paid, precarious workers with very little job stability compared to others of similar education and skills. We need the voices of artists in our world more than ever, and artists need the support of organizations like 18th Street.This campaign raises funds for a world-class artist residency program, but at 18th Street, we are so much more than that. 18th Street is a place where the public can learn about evolving contemporary artist practices. We commission new artwork and curatorial research and present it in an array of free experimental programs throughout the year. Through artist residencies, exhibitions, print publications, new media platforms and public events, 18th Street has helped over 8,000 artists develop new work and has hosted more that 450 international artists from 54 countries since our founding. By providing space, time, funding, and visibility, we incubate artists so they can create without precarity, make ambitious work and ask big questions. Our goal to raise $30,000 will carry this work into the future.Artists who come through 18th Street’s residency programs go on to make enormous impacts on their communities.

</div>","Our Story"" Where the spirit does not work with the hands, there is no art."" - Leonardo da VinciI have always known that artistry lies inherent in me and over the years it too is innate in my kids. So its no surprise that I have made a living in such a field and my kids got acclaim doing so in their own respective school. We want to keep drawing, painting, creating. And we want to share it through a media that will sustain our pursuits. What more perfect enterprise to share our love of art than to have it as a  wearable. We as a family have focused our sights on achieving this goal.  To design to our hearts delight and have it realized with quality . And so we venture into this business model of wearable art and custom apparels. We are now in the process of stocking our inventory, offering to the public custom designs for shirts, jackets and other clothing line. A dream fueled by art.Our Mission""The disparity between what schools offer and what students actually receive can be enormous, Some of those students are going to get music and some of those students aren't.""- Richard Kessler, Dean of Mannes College The New School of Music and former Executive Director of The Center for Arts Education.See Huffington Post blog below;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yohuru-williams/rhythm-and-bruise-how-cut_b_5838406.htmlWith your support we'd like to show you who we are and what we're passionate at. We would like to call awareness and appreciation to music & the arts in public schools and its after-school programs.  Over the years public schools in the United States have lessened their focus on the arts & music, In some cases it relies on private funding to keep these activities going, programs fueled only by eager parents, fantastic teachers, private pockets and hard working kids. We as parents of kids who are in these programs would like to extend our support using our venture as a platform.The music line of graphic tees is intended to bring about a visual display of awareness and appreciation to these performance arts. A tenth of the proceeds of this campaign will go to our local public school music and band programs. We also hope that this campaign will bring about new found zest and vigor for the public to extend aid to this cause. We try and do what little we can.Wear Art for Music.Our Dream

<p class=""p2"">Spurse is a research and design collaborative that catalyzes critical issues into collective action. Through a playful transformation of conceptual and material systems, we develop problems worth having and worlds worth making, engaging across scales and complexities of all things human and nonhuman, organic and non- organic. We begin every endeavor by locating ourselves of the world, not merely in the world. Spurse has an extensive amount of experience in designing educational community service events that bring together multiple stakeholders with the aim of making a positive difference in the world. Central to our mission is to creatively rethink how citizens can become aware of their position in ecological networks across multiple scales of temporality and spatiality. We have designed numerous public events that bring together diverse stakeholders and have collaborated with large-scale NGOs such as the North Atlantic Marine Alliance, the Riverkeepers and Rural Action. Our work emphasizes ecological dynamics, critical thinking and education for sustainability.

Hello, I'm Megan Charland. I'm producing and co-curating an experimental dinner event, The Civil Appetites, on May 3, 2013 with the research and design collaborative spurse. We are inviting participants to join us in a meal and conversation about food culture.  
The Civil Appetites is in conjunction with the exhibition Eat It at Rochester Contemporary Art Center (RoCo) April 4 - May 12, 2013. While our dinner event takes place towards the end of the exhibition, we will have an installation up at RoCo for the duration of Eat It to compliment, and lead up to, our event. The Civil Appetites is co-curated by Matthew Friday.  
The dinner event (May 3, 2013) is taking place during First Friday and we invite the public to stop in and participate!
I am thrilled to bring spurse to Rochester, NY and now am seeking your help to financially make it happen.


What We Need
The funds raised during this campaign will be used towards supplies for the exhibition and dinner event as well as providing an honorarium for spurse. Any additional funds raised will increase the honorarium for spurse going towards travel costs (to Rochester, NY).

Who, or rather what is spurse?
Spurse is a research and design collaborative that catalyzes critical issues into collective action. Through a playful transformation of conceptual and material systems, we develop problems worth having and worlds worth making, engaging across scales and complexities of all things human and nonhuman, organic and non- organic. We begin every endeavor by locating ourselves of the world, not merely in the world. Spurse has an extensive amount of experience in designing educational community service events that bring together multiple stakeholders with the aim of making a positive difference in the world. Central to our mission is to creatively rethink how citizens can become aware of their position in ecological networks across multiple scales of temporality and spatiality. We have designed numerous public events that bring together diverse stakeholders and have collaborated with large-scale NGOs such as the North Atlantic Marine Alliance, the Riverkeepers and Rural Action. Our work emphasizes ecological dynamics, critical thinking and education for sustainability. To learn more about us see: www.spurse.org.

Invitation from spurse
Please accept our invitation for dinner. To eat more than you can: Ideas, Practices and Foods. To give more than you know. 
We wish to explore and invent with you a world that is already everywhere: the commons. 
We wish to explore and invent with you a world that is still to come: the commons.
And yes, we can go on and tell you about all that is wrong with our food practices -- how we eat is literally killing us and the planet. But you know all that. So enough said. What should we do? Again, as you taught us, this is the wrong question. 
What are we already doing? What are you doing? We are interested in your practices.We are interested in what is everywhere -- the commons. We are interested in what is almost nowhere: subsistence. 
And so we invite you to an experimental dinner event The Civil Appetites, aimed at exploring future food ways and commons. What we can offer: a meal that radically fuses experimental practices of gathering, cooking, serving and talking. 
We look forward to spending the evening with you and seeing what could happen next!

It then engages 52 visual artist who respond to the stanzas with a linked series of drawings which we'll publish with the finished poem, as a book.  The Renga Project is inspired by the great sucess of our <a href=""http://axleart.com/index/2011_Exhibitions/Pages/Haiku_Roadsign.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Haiku Roadsign</a> project, from 2011.</p>
<p>The year-long Renga Project will expose thousands to a  public art and poetry collaboration created by over 100 people.</p>
<p>On June 21st, 2013, we'll install a beautiful wooden signboard, complete with a small roof near the corner of Guadalupe Street and Cerrillos Road, in the Railyard Park in Santa Fe.  Each week we’ll hang a new stanza on the sign.  Renga is an ancient traditional  collaborative form of poetry from Japan.  Poets write short stanzas which respond to what has come before.  Our Renga will be written by 49 New Mexico poets.  Santa Fe’s Poet Laureate <a href=""http://www.santafenm.gov/index.aspx?nid=821"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jon Davis</a> will start each of the four seasonal sections.  The other stanzas will be written by 24 poets selected by him and an additional 24 poets selected by them.  There will be 6 stanzas at a time on the sign.  As each new stanza is added, the oldest will be removed.  The public will experience, over the course of a year, a changing and evolving 52 stanza collaborative poem.<br/>In addition, we’ll invite 52 New Mexico Artists to create a linked drawing which illustrates the poem.  We’ll publish a book at the close of the project with the full poem and the full linked drawing.  There are 3 versions of the book, an affordable paperback, a series of four seasonal handmade miniature japanese-style folded books, and a beautiful limited edition handmade accordion book.  All of this will culminate with a reading of the poem with the poets at the New Mexico Museum of Art and an exhibition of the drawings in the Axle Contemporary mobile gallery in the summer of 2014.</p>
<strong>We need to raise a minimum of $1,500 to fund this project.</strong>  This will help pay for the construction and installation of the sign, the large-format printing of the stanzas, the weekly installation work, the design and printing of the book, organizational duties, and a copy of the book for each of the poets and artists. <br/><br/><br/><p>Please contribute to help us make this project.  And spread the word to let others know about it.</p>

#HHFGH campaign was born from the compassionate hearts of MadRat Bevco Team-members and their desire to Make A Difference in their community.  










Our primary goal is to raise $288,422 & raise awareness of the mass cuts to public school art, creativity, health and music programs.  The funds are allocated to:


1.  10% - Garden Oaks Creativity Festival, a festival to inspire the students to find their passion and engage in art & creativity programs
2. 40% - Create art, health & creativity programs at Garden Oaks Magnet Montessori
3. 40% - #MADenergy Launch Party & Fundraiser for Garden Oaks Magnet Montessori 
4.  5% - Supplies
5.  5% - Marketing & PR of the events and programs



The impact your donation has on the students of Garden Oaks is tremendous. Kids require creative outlets! Imagine what school would have been like without any art or music classes? No band? No painting, drawing, coloring?  No place for creative expression!  Removing these creativity programs from the school experience affects students' involvement and ability to truly learn.  In the past, most of the elementary school education revolved around some sort of artistic activity. The Garden Oaks School has little to no district funding for these areas of education.   Every aspect of their arts programs are currently being generously donated by parents, teachers, volunteers and the community.  Please support us in making a longterm difference in their lives. Have a hand in shaping their futures! You will also be giving a helping hand to MadRat Bevco, a company that believes success is directly attributed to the health and prosperity of their customers and community!

<p><em><strong> </strong></em>Hello world, my name is Gary Suraci and I am the founder of Artists for Autism.  My two major passions in life are working with kids with special needs and creating art in various forms, ( i.e. painting, sketch, charcoal, and photography). I have a Masters in Public Administration fro m Marist College, with a concentration in nonprofit administration.  I spent six amazing months at the University of Rome studying fine art and art history.  I have worked and volunteered with children with special needs for over five years now. Two of those years have been at PNW BOCES in Westchester.  More specifically I have experience working with children who have Autism, Traumatic Brain Injury, Cerebral Palsy, Down Syndrome, and Aspersers.  Each child I have worked with has changed my life and motivates me everyday to be a better person. </p>
<p>This campaign is very important to me because it’s combining my two passions in life are art and working with children with special needs! I have the opportunity to create art and sell that art while taking a portion of the proceeds and donating them to special education schools in order to help these inspirational children.  I am so excited and very fortunate to be able to start this company and help make a difference in a child's life who truly deserves it.   </p>
<p>Each contribution that is received will make a significant difference and will help out these children in so many ways. These funds are needed to help build a strong, safe, and efficient, website for anyone at anytime, anywhere to purchase an aesthetic masterpiece while consciously knowing they are helping a child with disabilities. Even a dollar can go so far in this campaign and each dollar is a dollar close to making this company one that makes a lasting impact for a child with special needs. Please help me help these children and provide a service with a purpose. </p>
<h3><em><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></em></h3>
<p>In order to make this a successful campaign I am going to need to raise at least $5,000.  Although this may seem to be a lot of money at first it really is not.  Every dollar that is raised through this campaign even if  it does not reach the full goal will be used for two important things.  Most of the money will go towards creating a company website.  This website is going to be extremely efficient, effective, easy to navigate, and safe for anyone to use.  The website is going to be one of the main tools for Artists for Autism.  The main function of the website is to provide an online place where donators can view the artist who is involved in the project and their works.  Once the donator finds an artist or a personalized piece that they like they then can place an order to purchase that piece or request a particular piece.  Besides being a portal to purchase art, the other purpose of the website will be to inform the donators where there money goes and how it directly made a difference in a child’s life with disabilities.  </p>
<p>The great news is that each donation you will receive a PERK ! Depending on the donation amount you can receive anything from a custom black and white photo, a personal painting, even a DVD of the artists artwork and a custom art kit which includes an instructional video.  </p>
<p> <em style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><strong>The Impact</strong></em></p>
<p>Everyday more children are being born with disabilities both physical and mental.  These amazing kids deserve any help they can get in anyway.  Please know that our main purpose is to raise money through our artwork in order to help these kids by donating money to their schools and purchasing adaptive equipment and technology needed for them to better access their academic environment. </p>
<h3><em><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></em></h3>
<p>I understand that these are tough economic times and its hard to spare with ones hard earned money.  If you cannot donate you can still help and make a difference.  So all I ask of you is to please spread the word!! Please let friends, family members, and coworkers know about Artists for Autism and our mission to help developmentally disabled special needs.  This is just as important as a monetary donation. </p>
<p>Another great way to spread the word about AFA is to use the Indiegogo share tools! Its easy, quick, and helps get the word out quick. </p>
<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, consideration, and more importantly support and donations.</p>

Another great way to spread the word about AFA is to use the Indiegogo share tools! Its easy, quick, and helps get the word out quick. 
And that’s all there is to it.
Thank you for your time, consideration, and more importantly support and donations.

<p>My dream of opening an art studio began 14 years ago. In 1997 my dad passed away unexpectedly. Our family was devastated. In an effort to fill her time and lonliness, my mom left her corporate job and bought a paint your own pottery studio. I decided to leave my job too and help her with this new endeavor. From there a passion for small business, pottery and art grew. The studio was our retreat from the reality of losing my dad. When she decided to sell the store-front business, I created a mobile pottery and ceramics company called <a href=""http://www.studio2you.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Studio2You</a> taking art to local schools, community centers, hosting birthday parties and other events. I ran the mobile pottery business for over 12 years on a part time basis so that I could also be at home with our two young children. <br/><b></b></p>
<p><b>the next step</b>  </p>
<p>Three years ago I decided what our Rainier Valley neighborhood needed was an art studio and I was going to be the one to make it happen!  There are no art studios like ours in the area. In fact, we live in an area of SE Seattle which is remarkably  underserved. We love living here and wanted to bring to life this working studio so we could offer our services to the most diverse zip code in the country! During this journey I met a woman who was so inspired by my business idea that she offered to be a financial investor and partner in the company. We were on our way.</p>
<p><b>we did it!</b></p>

<p>So, after years of planning we opened <a href=""http://www.emeraldcityfiredarts.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Emerald City Fired Arts Studio &amp; Gallery</a> a neighborhood storefront pottery studio specializing in paint your own pottery, clay art, mosaics and glass fusion. Every detail of the studio was architecturally designed and carefully executed from the hand-made paint pallets to the colors on the walls. Our team worked tirelessly on every detail to make the space inviting, warm and welcoming for people of all ages and all levels of experience. We want the studio to appeal to the hobby artist as well as the professional and want to foster the idea that everyone is creative. We are also proud to feature local artists work on our gallery walls which as a by-product provides inspiration and joy to all who visit our studio.</p>

<p><br/><strong>indie gogo!</strong></p>
<p>When I found out about IndieGoGo, I was moved. What an amazing concept...that others would invest their money in people's projects just because they can or that they believe in the idea. We have exhausted all other traditional avenues for securing funding and have used all our personal savings. We have investors and others counting on me to make this business a success. I am asking for $15,000 to help us get on our feet. Even though our doors are open, we have financial burdens that make it difficult to thrive. This money will help pay for build-out construction costs (which includes an expensive piece of HVAC equipment that the city of Seattle required we have but we didn’t know about prior to construction) and a second kiln that we need in order to grow our business. I am hopeful folks will find it in their hearts to help us out so we can do what we do best which is to offer artistic opportunities to our patrons, collaborate in community-building art projects and foster the idea that art is an important part of our existence as human beings. I sincerely thank you for spending the time to read this and considering donating to our project. I am confident our studio will have a positive impact on people's lives and our community.</p>

The rewards are awesome!
Participatory experience is key - which is why we’re putting it into the gifts for Backers of the project. As much as possible, we want the gifts to be something you can use, play with or experience.
The success of the project means that you will be able to interact with the 'Hand'', to create your own musical and light-filled experience, together with others.
 
What is Midburn?
‘Midburn’ is the Israeli Burning Man regional. Hundreds of Israelis who have been to Burning Man in Nevada. Hundreds more have been to Midburn events in Israel. The events are as diverse as their participants.
 
The creative process and design:
There were a lot of ideas at first and everyone has been really passionate and curious about what it would look like and how it would feel when we finally got it onto the Playa.
The final design follows three basic concepts: simplicity, tribe and inspiration.


Simplicity - the design itself has a simple, yet beautiful geometry. The interactive lights and drums have a simple interface. The message is simple.


Tribe - the base of the ‘Hand’ is a circular stage that participants can gather around as a tribe, playing the drums, dancing, collaborating.


Inspiration - we want to create an inspiring experience that would be our gift to Black Rock City’s citizens.

Simplicity + Inspiration X Tribe = ‘The Hand of Inspiration’
 
Burning Man and the Cargo Cult art theme:
The Burning Man event is an experiment in temporary community. 'The Hand of Inspiration' is an experiment in temporary tribe.
“Cargo Cult”, this year’s art theme at Burning Man, is a mixture of the old and the new.

We've been slinging toast with over 100 various toppings (both ordinary and strange) for the masses at CON for 12 years.</p><p>In the past, we have funded our party primarily with money from our contributing core group of volunteers, supplemented by tips from our awesome party guests. This year, we really want to take steps to improve the flow of the line, and take our party to the next level!

The model which we have picked will be around $600 plus shipping.</p></li>
<li><p>Our main fundraising goal is to raise enough money to purchase the toaster, Anything over that first goal, we will put towards future HoT room party improvements -- purchasing wall panels for faster setup, a second digital toppings menu board, improved topping stations, a washing station, etc. If we exceed our $1700 goal, we will also level up our incentives by adding new, shiny rewards to those who donate! Some improvements will have to wait until 2015 to implement, but we want to get as many in this year as we can.</p></li>
</ul><h3>What You Get</h3><p>All incentives can be shipped or picked up from Noon-3pm on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday of the convention.

We've been slinging toast with over 100 various toppings (both ordinary and strange) for the masses at CON for 12 years.In the past, we have funded our party primarily with money from our contributing core group of volunteers, supplemented by tips from our awesome party guests. This year, we really want to take steps to improve the flow of the line, and take our party to the next level! So we need YOUR help.What We NeedWhat we will be using this fundraising money for:
Our main goal for the fundraiser is a new belt-drive toaster to make toasting faster and more efficient, thus getting you toast more quickly. The model which we have picked will be around $600 plus shipping.
Our main fundraising goal is to raise enough money to purchase the toaster, Anything over that first goal, we will put towards future HoT room party improvements -- purchasing wall panels for faster setup, a second digital toppings menu board, improved topping stations, a washing station, etc. If we exceed our $1700 goal, we will also level up our incentives by adding new, shiny rewards to those who donate! Some improvements will have to wait until 2015 to implement, but we want to get as many in this year as we can.
What You GetAll incentives can be shipped or picked up from Noon-3pm on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday of the convention. Please indicate which you would prefer during the checkout process. If you are an international supporter, please add $5 to your donation for shipping.Awesome incentives!
All donors will have their name printed on our “Toaster of Fame”, to commemorate your fabulous support of House of Toast. If you don’t want your name on the Toaster, please let us know.

All donors at $5 and above will get a fabulous ""Piece of Toast"" badge ribbon to adorn your CON badge! 




$15 donors get an orange “House of Toast” lanyard to proudly display their CON badge.
$30 donors will get a tan ""House of Toast"" t-shirt, printed with our logo. 
             Curvy, tight cut sizes available: S-2XL (aka “women’s” cut)             Standard t-shirt cut sizes available: S-4XL. (aka “men’s” cut)

<p>For 26 years, I've been on a path of focusing, every day, on
the planetary positions, in the astrological night sky, geometrically, energetically, and experientially,
through observation of self and others in syncronicity with planetary cycles.<br/></p>
<p>""Treasure Map 4 Your Soul,""
is my giant box, in which to place the ""gems"" of my time with the
stars, to better share them with you. I am turning a seemingly
complicated system, of many, into a simple mapping system, guiding anyone
and everyone to find ""their own treasures,"" and the treasures of
others too!  The greatest gift of
the stars--is the treasures it uncovers within, and each day.</p>
<p>Syncronicities light me on fire, and ""surfing the
stars,"" increases syncronicity by manyfold.  Through watching the cycles and asking how to master
""surfing the archetypal energies,"" as they change, i have asked, and
received answers from mysterious and not-so-mysterious places. Together, box
and contents, we each are a plethora of real treasures.</p>
<p>One example of this is my observation and the consistent,
stand-by structure in our earth-human time: of the MOON in its lunar cycle.
This can be as simple as ""looking up,"" at night and seeing how big
the moon is, and noticing if it is growing or shrinking.</p>
<p>As the Moon waxes and wanes; our energy, enthusiasm, sexual
arousal, desire to be social, does seem to rise and fall. There are all kinds
of mysterious and syncronistic risings and fallings of energy, like the tides,
moods, women's breasts and wombs, cellular regeneration, and the cycle of
creation of life itself, like the Moon, all things rise and fall.</p>
<p>Our energy and timing seems to move around the Moon's
archetypal clock. The Moon is the most simple for us to see visually. Its cycle is see-ably eloquent to
us, from the ground--and there are other planets who are more potent, more
mysterious, more solid, or more fluid, to surf.</p>
<p>We live in a house of cycles, that live within our house of
stars. Above our heads, there lies a light-filled map that seems to reflect my
mood each day, and possibly yours?!</p>

<h3><span>About LA Zine Fest</span></h3>
<p>We at the L.A. Zine Fest (LAZF) are dedicated to promoting zine culture as a means to connect the pre-existing communities in L.A.–artistic and otherwise. We believe that by embracing the urge to create and to share ideas, the local zine community can increase its presence and flourish. Throughout the year, LAZF’s organizers put on zine panels and workshops throughout the city, but it all builds up to the Zine Fest: an opportunity for zinesters local and far-flung to meet and exchange ideas with each other and with all of Los Angeles!</p>
<p>The third annual L.A. Zine Fest will take place on February 16, 2014 at the Helms Bakery complex in Culver City.  We are excited to have a roomy venue that can accommodate our steadily growing numbers--we hope to avoid last year’s lines around the block! LAZF’s organizers are hard at work on the schedule for 2014’s LAZF and are planning incredible workshops, panels, and readings throughout the day.  </p>

Purple Angel Foundation Background:
Ellen Miller of Rutland started the Purple Angle Foundation in the memory of her daughter, Carly Jean Ferro, whose life was cut incredibly short by an inebriated driver two years ago, when she was just 17.  The non-profit organization keeps the light that Carly brought to her community shining through charitable, community, and educational projects in Rutland.

  The Impact

Any funds will be helpful to this cause! Because the Purple Angel Foundation is a non-profit with all sorts of wonderful ambitions, the less that comes out of the coffers for a mural, the more money can be spent on other great projects that the Purple Angel Foundation is supporting, such as:




Little Free Libraries around Rutland City

Purple Benches back in Depot Park and in other areas of the city
Golf scholarship for college bound senior
Citizenship award to a senior, nominated by teachers at Rutland High School
Rutland Free Library annual fundraiser by a sponsorship

Mural to be painted on the side of the Discount Food Store in Rutland 




Public Art is such a great tool to build and brighten community in places that need it most, and I am so grateful and humbled every time I am asked to paint a wall in VT. If I can make it easier, financially, for a non-profit (short of working for free), I will do what I can!

 Front Porch Arts Collective provides a home for creating and experiencing multi-disciplinary art inspired by the voices of the Southeast.

In December 2013, Front Porch staff asked one another, what would it take to make Greenville, SC a center for the arts? And not just any kind of arts, but multi-disciplinary, community-based, collaboratively-created art? The kind of art that is innovative, local, and of the highest quality possible? 
Our short answer is Potluck. Here's what to look forward to:




Wednesday, August 6 @ 6pm: Kickoff PartyA family friendly night of live music, visual art, and fellowship. Come hear the electronic R&B of Rich Engli$h and the sweet feisty soul folk of Rachel Kate, surrounded by photographs of the West Greenville community curated by David Bram of Fraction Magazine. Food and drink provided with ticket cost.


Thursday, August 7 @ 7pm: Porch Light Playwrights

An ensemble of Greenville actors present staged readings penned by Upstate playwrights Travis Ballenger, Breanna Foister, Bryson Howard, Cortney McEniry, Jacob Perkins, and Abby Rosebrock at the historic Taylors Mill-turned-artisan-coffee-shop.

For about 10 years I made computer graphics and advertising. But life and responsibilities begun to take their toll. And, as a form of relaxation, I slowly begun to start painting and drawing again.

All that was happening was motivating me, but I still had some doubts if this is my calling. Until I was stopped! Immobilized for 3 months, I painted, painted and painted again. I posted everything on-line and I just realize that <strong>what I paint inspires others: to paint, to make poems, to transform everything in sounds and feelings. I then knew this was my way.

<h3>Who are we?<br/>
</h3>
<p><b>HIMHERANDIT Productions</b> is a non-profit art organization based in Aarhus, Denmark since 2009. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>HIMHERANDIT Productions is led by the artists <b>Noelia Mora Solvez</b> and <b>Andreas Constantinou</b> whom to date have performed and exhibited their work nationally and internationally.<span></span> Since
 working together in 2009 Noelia and Andreas have been specifically 
driven to create bold live art, physical theatre and performance installation 
productions in Denmark.
 Specifically focusing on contemporary and experimental work that pushes
 artistic boundaries and tries to further broaden artistic perspectives,
 communication and culture in Aarhus, Denmark. 
</p>
<h3>About our project:</h3>
<p>
You
are making: is a 6 week Live-Art Laboratory that takes place at
Godsbanen in March-April 2014. The laboratory contains 5 brand new interactive
live-art installations, 5 Public Forums, Workshops and a concluding Exhibition. The project includes guest artists: Mormor (Visual artist), Kitt Johnson (Performance artist), Jeppe Worning (Designer), Marie Gabrielle Rotie
(Butoh/Live artists), Michel Dinesen (Film artist) and Allan Henriksen (Photographer) <br/></p>
<h3><b>About the 5 live-art interactive installations:<br/></b></h3>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p>These 5 performances are the base of project as a whole. They are
specifically related to the cross over of Interactive live-art and how visual art can become an immersive experience for
audiences.<span>  There is one simple objective
that underpins all of the 5 installations; To interact with art instead of only observing it. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the live-art
installations Andreas and Noelia present situations where spectators encounter
their naked bodies in different interactive contexts. The naked bodies display
themselves in vulnerable and intimate situations where audiences can paint,
cast, play, move, bath or even simply talk to them. By doing so, the work aims to create an environment of sensory-emotional
values in which to play. The installations aim to guide people’s intuitive creative
processes within a creative playground.</p>
<h3><b>Guest Artists and how they are involved in the laboratory:</b></h3>
<p>
Each
Performance will involve one renowned guest artist. All the guests come from different artistic backgrounds and will be involved in singular performances as creative leaders alongside the general public. Their roles with in the performances are to play freely in the playground set up for them by Andreas and Noelia. <br/></p>
<h3>Forums and LabRats:</h3>
<p>
As there will be 5 performances as part of the
laboratory there will also be 5 artistic forums. The forums aim to create
on-going dialogue between artist, cultural figures and the public about the development of
Live-Art in Denmark. </p>
<p>
To achieve this we aim to recruit “Voluntary
Participants” whom we will be named “Lab Rats”. The lab rats will be recruited from a diverse range
of people, including: selected general public, artists from the surrounding community and Cultural leaders in Denmark.<span><br/></span></p>
<h3>Workshops:</h3>
<p>Throughout the laboratory period there will be a series of performance and live-art workshops led by the artists.<br/></p>
<h3>Concluding Exhibition:</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The concluding exhibition gathers photos, videos and recordings collected and edited
by the artists in collaboration with Michael Dinesen and Allan Henriksen.<span>  The exhibit will serve as the final installment
of the laboratory offering spectators an outside perspective into the previous
5 weeks.</span><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>Why is this important?</b></h3>
<p></p>
Every art form needs time, space and audience development in order for it to reach its maximum potential. This 6 week laboratory grips the surrounding community, artists and cultural leaders by involving them in the development of the live-art scene through a hands on approach. <br/><br/><i>A live-art experience can be a life changing event for some people. It is for sure a life changing experience for the artists themselves. </i><br/><br/><p>The project is
driven with an eagerness to display “vulnerabilities”. What happens when
artists place themselves into exposing situations, handing themselves over to
spectators? By doing exactly this, we desire to brake down barriers and invoke human contact on the most basic
levels.<span>  Bodies are presented in
vulnerable contexts where audiences have the choices to fulfill their basic
drives; to nurture, take care of, play with or even ignore
them. <br/></span></p>
<h3>
What we need to achieve this? </h3>
<p>In order to achieve this project we have created a fundraising campaign that divides between public and private funds, sponsorship and crowdfunding. 20% of our budget is already secured through public funds and sponsorship.  <br/></p>
<p>This is where we count on YOU TO HELP US GET UP AND RUNNING! <br/></p>
<p>We would now like to raise 10% or more of this projects fund through crowd funding. In the meantime we will continue on our search to raise the rest of the funds through public and private funding.</p>
<p>Please note that every cent counts and with every little you support us this project takes one step further to be possible. <br/></p>
<p>We want to do this project FOR and WITH YOU....<br/></p>
<h3><strong>Where your money goes?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Art Materials (for 2 of the performance installations)</li>
<li>Technical equipment (hiring of equipment)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any additional funds raised beyond our goal will go towards:</p>
<ul><li>Art Materials (for the rest of the performances)<br/>
</li></ul>
<p>If we do not reach our goal you money will still go towards art materials (in a smaller scale).<br/></p>
<h3>
<strong>I have no money! How can I help?</strong>

HIMHERANDIT Productions is a non-profit art organization based in Aarhus, Denmark since 2009. 


HIMHERANDIT Productions is led by the artists Noelia Mora Solvez and Andreas Constantinou whom to date have performed and exhibited their work nationally and internationally. Since
 working together in 2009 Noelia and Andreas have been specifically 
driven to create bold live art, physical theatre and performance installation 
productions in Denmark.
 Specifically focusing on contemporary and experimental work that pushes
 artistic boundaries and tries to further broaden artistic perspectives,
 communication and culture in Aarhus, Denmark. 

About our project:

You
are making: is a 6 week Live-Art Laboratory that takes place at
Godsbanen in March-April 2014. The laboratory contains 5 brand new interactive
live-art installations, 5 Public Forums, Workshops and a concluding Exhibition. The project includes guest artists: Mormor (Visual artist), Kitt Johnson (Performance artist), Jeppe Worning (Designer), Marie Gabrielle Rotie
(Butoh/Live artists), Michel Dinesen (Film artist) and Allan Henriksen (Photographer) 
About the 5 live-art interactive installations:


These 5 performances are the base of project as a whole. They are
specifically related to the cross over of Interactive live-art and how visual art can become an immersive experience for
audiences.  There is one simple objective
that underpins all of the 5 installations; To interact with art instead of only observing it. 


In the live-art
installations Andreas and Noelia present situations where spectators encounter
their naked bodies in different interactive contexts. The naked bodies display
themselves in vulnerable and intimate situations where audiences can paint,
cast, play, move, bath or even simply talk to them. By doing so, the work aims to create an environment of sensory-emotional
values in which to play. The installations aim to guide people’s intuitive creative
processes within a creative playground.
Guest Artists and how they are involved in the laboratory:

Each
Performance will involve one renowned guest artist. All the guests come from different artistic backgrounds and will be involved in singular performances as creative leaders alongside the general public. Their roles with in the performances are to play freely in the playground set up for them by Andreas and Noelia. 
Forums and LabRats:

As there will be 5 performances as part of the
laboratory there will also be 5 artistic forums. The forums aim to create
on-going dialogue between artist, cultural figures and the public about the development of
Live-Art in Denmark. 

To achieve this we aim to recruit “Voluntary
Participants” whom we will be named “Lab Rats”. The lab rats will be recruited from a diverse range
of people, including: selected general public, artists from the surrounding community and Cultural leaders in Denmark.
Workshops:
Throughout the laboratory period there will be a series of performance and live-art workshops led by the artists.
Concluding Exhibition:


The concluding exhibition gathers photos, videos and recordings collected and edited
by the artists in collaboration with Michael Dinesen and Allan Henriksen.  The exhibit will serve as the final installment
of the laboratory offering spectators an outside perspective into the previous
5 weeks.
Why is this important?

Every art form needs time, space and audience development in order for it to reach its maximum potential. This 6 week laboratory grips the surrounding community, artists and cultural leaders by involving them in the development of the live-art scene through a hands on approach. A live-art experience can be a life changing event for some people. It is for sure a life changing experience for the artists themselves. The project is
driven with an eagerness to display “vulnerabilities”. What happens when
artists place themselves into exposing situations, handing themselves over to
spectators? By doing exactly this, we desire to brake down barriers and invoke human contact on the most basic
levels.  Bodies are presented in
vulnerable contexts where audiences have the choices to fulfill their basic
drives; to nurture, take care of, play with or even ignore
them. 

What we need to achieve this? 
In order to achieve this project we have created a fundraising campaign that divides between public and private funds, sponsorship and crowdfunding. 20% of our budget is already secured through public funds and sponsorship.  
This is where we count on YOU TO HELP US GET UP AND RUNNING! 
We would now like to raise 10% or more of this projects fund through crowd funding. In the meantime we will continue on our search to raise the rest of the funds through public and private funding.
Please note that every cent counts and with every little you support us this project takes one step further to be possible. 
We want to do this project FOR and WITH YOU....
Where your money goes?

Art Materials (for 2 of the performance installations)
Technical equipment (hiring of equipment)

Any additional funds raised beyond our goal will go towards:
Art Materials (for the rest of the performances)

If we do not reach our goal you money will still go towards art materials (in a smaller scale).

I have no money! How can I help?


Spread the word! Let everyone know about this exciting 6 week laboratory coming your way! Get in contact with old 
buddies and let them know about this campaign. Mention it on Twitter or 
Facebook or wherever people hang out on the internet nowadays. Be a kind hearted person and distribute the word.

<p>Our goal is to combine art and science in a way that will educate, amuse and lead to rigorous science. </p>
<p>Many past experiments have shown an impact of mass celebrations on the output of random number generators: <a href=""http://noosphere.princeton.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://noosphere.princeton.edu/</a>. </p>
<p>Based on this history, we expect the mass revelry at Burning Man, particularly during the burning of the Man and the Temple, to result in deviations from the mean output of the random number generators. RNGs are electronic devices that output a stream of ones and zeros randomly. Over time, the ones and zeros balance out exactly. But not apparently during mass celebrations, for some unknown reason. </p>
<p>We anticipate a more significant impact on the RNG output from the mass Burning Man celebrations because the people who attend Burning Man are more spiritually attuned and/or attentive to synchronicities than the population at large. Our experiment will test this hypothesis. </p>
<p>We're seeking $2,000 in additional funding, to pay for computers, RNGs, lasers, etc., with $500 already pledged by the Global Coherence Initiative. </p>
<p>The better we do at fundraising the HUGER our freakin' lasers can be! So help us out. Any funds not used this year will go into a revolving fund for future iterations in future years of the Burn. </p></div>","Art in the service of science; science in the service of art!

Last but not least, David Shearer, PhD, board member of Black Rock Solar, is also assisting. 
Our goal is to combine art and science in a way that will educate, amuse and lead to rigorous science. 
Many past experiments have shown an impact of mass celebrations on the output of random number generators: http://noosphere.princeton.edu/. 
Based on this history, we expect the mass revelry at Burning Man, particularly during the burning of the Man and the Temple, to result in deviations from the mean output of the random number generators. RNGs are electronic devices that output a stream of ones and zeros randomly. Over time, the ones and zeros balance out exactly. But not apparently during mass celebrations, for some unknown reason. 
We anticipate a more significant impact on the RNG output from the mass Burning Man celebrations because the people who attend Burning Man are more spiritually attuned and/or attentive to synchronicities than the population at large. Our experiment will test this hypothesis. 
We're seeking $2,000 in additional funding, to pay for computers, RNGs, lasers, etc., with $500 already pledged by the Global Coherence Initiative. 
The better we do at fundraising the HUGER our freakin' lasers can be! So help us out. Any funds not used this year will go into a revolving fund for future iterations in future years of the Burn.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Affordable studio space in New York City is extremely difficult to find. The fact that the studios at Fowler are always filled to capacity is a testament to the fact that Fowler came to the right neighborhood at the right time! Fowler is making it work with very little funds, but we are in desperate need of some basic facilities upgrades and a dedicated budget for the gallery and events program. Receiving this funding would ensure that Fowler has the opportunity to continue being a part of the artistic community of New York and that its small family of artists can continue to thrive. </p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">As a collective, Fowler is not a traditional gallery. We function as a 
non-profit, and the gallery program is focused on exhibiting <a href=""http://www.fowlerartsbrooklyn.org/gallery.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 87); text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank"" title="""">collaborative exhibitions</a> between
 artists. By focusing on collaborative exhibitions, Fowler gives the 
selected artists a chance to take over the gallery and produce a show 
that they otherwise would not have the opportunity to organize, free of 
space or financial restrictions. The Fowler studios are based directly 
on graduate art school studio buildings with open studio plans, shared 
communal facilities, and hang-out areas (check out a slide show of our 
artists spaces <a href=""http://s887.photobucket.com/albums/ac76/fowlerarts/Artist%20Studios%20at%20Fowler%20Arts%20Collective/?albumview=slideshow"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 87); text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank"" title="""">here</a>).
 The gallery and studio areas are not separated, so any event or 
exhibition in the gallery brings visitors and dialogue into the Fowler 
artist's studios. Fowler started out as a vast, empty industrial space. 
It has since evolved into a hotbed of artistic pursuit. Check out a <a href=""http://s887.photobucket.com/albums/ac76/fowlerarts/When%20Fowler%20Was%20New%202010/?albumview=slideshow"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 87); text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank"" title="""">slide show</a> of the space being constructed by Lia and a few Fowler artists last summer. We have come a long way!   <br/></p><br/><p class=""MsoNormal"">The Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn is filled with
artists of all kinds, but it lacks a cohesive gallery and arts scene. Fowler
aims to be a site for this community of artists to meet, collaborate, and

an important part of the emerging artist community in North Brooklyn.

Fowler Arts Collective is a studio and gallery collective located in the
historic Greenpoint Terminal Market building on the Brooklyn waterfront. Established in July of 2010 by Lia Post, Fowler's Founder, Director and only
employee, Fowler offers visual artists affordable studio spaces and access to
communal facilities such as a small woodshop, an artists' lounge, and a
gallery space. There are 18 studios in Fowler housing 24 artists working in painting, sculpture, photography, and illustration. We also have a 900 square foot gallery and event space which is the site for collaborative visual art exhibitions, classes, events, and readings. We curate one to two month shows of talented emerging artists and also accept exhibition and event proposals from New York City artists and beyond.Fowler is seeking funding to help support and expand our gallery and events program with a dedicated budget as well as to ensure that our artist studio spaces remain as affordable as possible as rent for the space inevitably rises.

<h3>Dino &amp; Panda T-shirts</h3>
<p>Hi hi :)</p>
<p>My name is Elaine~ <br/><br/>My goal for this campaign is $1000 and I would like to create 100 hand-painted T-shirts (not silk screened...every tshirt will be unique!) I plan to reserve 50 of the T-shirts for sale at local art shows in my hometown, and the rest will be available for purchase from fans all over the world!</p>
<p>Let me tell you a bit about myself so you know I'm not a weird psycho.</p>
<p>I'm a 4th year university student (Visual Arts Major) and I plan to do more school to eventually become an elementary school teacher :) That means...I will continue being poor for a little while longer... HOWEVER! Nothing can keep me away from making art! I spend most of my time outside of school volunteering with arts &amp; crafts events where I can work with children, adults, and seniors.  Feelings of happiness from all these opportunities fuel a lot of my own artwork -a constant source of inspiration.<br/><br/>My awesome fans on Facebook have continually given me encouragement to get t-shirts printed featuring my Dino &amp; Panda and all their friends for quite some time now, but I'm a starving university student and I didn't know where to start! <br/><br/>Recently, we had a lovely guest speaker in one of my classes who introduced us to the concept of crowdfunding.  Needless to say, I was super excited to try it out :) <br/><br/>For those who don't know much about Dino &amp; Panda, you can visit my facebook fanpage: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Dino.Panda.Inc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Dino &amp; Panda Inc ""><strong>http://www.facebook.com/Dino.Panda.Inc</strong></a> after you take a look at my campaign video to learn more :)   <br/><br/>If you have any questions please ask me! I'd love to tell you all about Dino &amp; Panda :) <br/><br/>If Dino &amp; Panda have brought a smile to your face, I hope you can spread that love and joy to someone close to you too!  Spreading happiness is what we do best (by ""we"" I mean Dino &amp; Panda, and I. hehe)!<br/><br/>Thanks a million for watching :D</p>

<h3>Dino &amp; Panda's Thank-you gifts:</h3>
<p>I realize $1000 may not cover all the costs but I'm hoping it will at least cover most of the costs for tshirts, fabric paint, shipping, and other materials for the production of the perks I want to give to my contributors! </p>
<p>Take a look at the various perks associated with each pledge level.  Some of the gifts include a cute pompom Panda, greeting cards, original drawings, and paintings. Dino &amp; Panda would love to become a part of your lives :D</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's Next if this campaign is successful?</h3>
<p>This is hopefully just the beginning of something more awesome.  I would love to be able to continue creating Dino &amp; Panda t-shirts, tote bags, pillow cases, diaries....you name it! Everything! As long as Dino &amp; Panda have the ability to cheer someone up, I want to work hard and spread their love everywhere :) </p>
<p>I have a secret dream to start my own business someday and have Dino &amp; Panda touch as many hearts as I can.  This campaign is a good way for me to test the waters and see how many people are interested in Dino &amp; Panda merchandise.  I've been happy and content just sharing all my artwork on my fanpage till now but I guess I need to think about the reality of my situation as a jobless university student...</p>
<p>Plus, I want to fulfill the wishes of my fans :) I love you all! If this campaign isn't as successful as I hope it to be, please be a bit patient and wait until I can save up enough money to make this all possible! </p>

<h3>If you can't contribute, that's ok!</h3>
<p>Don't feel bad if you aren't in a position to contribute to my $1000 goal.  <br/>I know I'm not the only starving university student out there! Just become a fan of Dino &amp; Panda and follow us on our journey, share with all your friends, and smile for us! </p>
<p>Your smiles give me power. With power comes inspiration for more artwork! More artwork means more smiles...and more power! It's a positive feedback loop hehe~</p>
<p>Please let all your friends and family know about this campaign by using the Indiegogo share tools~ share on Facebook, Twitter, blogs, etc. </p>
<p>Dino &amp; Panda love getting comments on their drawings so if you're a fan on facebook don't be shy! Leave a message! I always do my best to reply every message. All of them. </p>

<h3>Who am I &amp; What is Masala Collage?</h3>
<p>

My name is Antonio Merinero I am a graphic artist and travelling is the thread in my life and work. Extensive travels through my native Spain, Europe, Latin America and Asia are a limitless source of inspiration for my artwork. </p>
<p> The route, search, outcome and interpretation differ worldwide, yet there are a few stations through which we all pass.

<h3>What is Masala Collage? </h3>
<p></p>
<p> Masala Collage is a handcrafted collage collection made by Spanish artist Antonio Merinero and many artist from several Asian countries. It is a travelling art investigation and collaboration with the varying cultural insights on life as a driving force. Because life’s a journey –destination unknown– from 2004 to the present, five editions of these collage were finished, adding around eighty pieces of art with formats ranging between 70x100 and 300x600 cm. </p>
<p>An ever continuous project. In 2007 masala collages became Masala collages On Tour and Not for Sale. It is and will be co-owned by everyone all over the planet who made its existence possible.<br/></p>
<p>Masala Collage ""On Tour"" showcases my work and the work of other artists and crafters from remotes sites, it has worked as a platform for workshops where we worked together on a fullfilling experience that cross the boundaries of races, cultures or religions.</p>

<h3>What is the plan?</h3>This year the plan is to return to Thailand with Cervantes. Go to Thailand with translated abstracts and quotes from Cervantes Quixote and find craftsmen or artists who enjoy the idea of reflecting on the old Spanish master´s words from a Thai point of view and create collages together, visually capturing this powerful blend of cross cultural thought on life.<br/>Masala Collage On Tour is part of a whole, the need now is to make a linking step between its previous edition in India ""Life as a journey"" (see blog for details) to Thailand's ""The Madness of it All"" to the following edition in Miami, U.S.A., where we are expected by the end of this year. Masala Thailand will be on show and Masala Miami will be born. A new edition with a new theme, leitmotif and more and more artists joining our ever growing modest yet great network to have more cross cultural fun, and share thoughts on life.<br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do we need and where the money will go</h3>
<p>I need 4000$. to pay for:</p>
<p>International transport return ticket Madrid-Bangkok.</p>
<p>Local transport train, bus.</p>
<p>International transport of finished pieces Bangkok - Madrid</p>
<p>Materials for the production of the pieces</p>
<p>Final mounting of the pieces.</p>
<p>Wages of local artists</p>
<p>Wooden box for artwork transportation</p>
<p>Plain and simple meals (vital to keep going).</p>
<p>Hotels whenever couchsourfing not available</p>
<p> etc,</p>
<p>Till now I have been financing this project out of my own pocket and with some small grants from institutions, that I contribute every now and then, after long months of paper work, calls, visits to official buildings and other time comsuming tasks. But because Masala's spirit is sharing, I thought that trying to find ""crowdfunding"" makes perfect sense.Whenever possible I will be couchsurfing to lower spending but really to find easier acces to Thai life and  to navigate the country with Thai help and company.<br/></p>

My name is Antonio Merinero I am a graphic artist and travelling is the thread in my life and work. Extensive travels through my native Spain, Europe, Latin America and Asia are a limitless source of inspiration for my artwork. 
 The route, search, outcome and interpretation differ worldwide, yet there are a few stations through which we all pass. Birth, death, spirituality, passion and the pain when love is gone are among those that make all of us so beautifully human. Although mankind lives in violent disagreement most of the time we all recognise these universals easily. 
 It was this all-encompassing yet simple idea that inspired me to compose a jigsaw of letters, postcards, my draws and paintings and those of others fellow artist met on the road, to cut and glue a journey of live and other stories.

In short, the work was likely commissioned by Bonaccorso Pinadori and executed in the period 1528-30, in which Florence was under siege and the city was governed by a short-lived Republic before it was once again taken over by the Medici family, who would then consolidate their rule, becoming Dukes and then Grand Dukes of Tuscany for the following 200 years. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534757983/abscycwqvgmlndf3udqm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>[Carmignano from above, with the church at its center]</i></p><p>The painting was not made for the church in Carmignano, but, Edelstein suggests, was commissioned for a Franciscan church outside of the city walls which was destroyed during the siege. Thus, the owner, who was a Medici enemy, took it to the family villa in Carmignano, where they had a private chapel. It is documented here in 1677, and then next mentioned in our church in 1720. It may have been transferred there when, that same year, the Pinadori family sold the villa. It was made to fit an altar frame that was designed for another painting, perhaps once promised by the now financially unfortunate Pinadori family.</p><p>While Pontormo’s panel was not made for the church in Carmignano, it certainly found an ideal location in this Franciscan setting and became <strong>particularly important to this community</strong>. For more than two hundred years, it never left the church; afterwards, it has only traveled to Florence, for restoration and a handful of exhibitions. Travel has only ever been authorized for the good of the painting, in terms of scientific study, restoration, and now fundraising.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534757132/q1te5npmgah1cwhuns3b.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The Church of San Michele is said to have been founded on land donated to Saint Francis himself in 1211.

Eyes locked, their intense gaze shows both joy and deep understanding; they are exchanging the happy news that they are both pregnant.This is the Visitation, a masterpiece of Renaissance art by the enigmatic painter Pontormo. The meeting between cousins Mary and Elisabeth, and of their unborn children Jesus and John, are represented in a way that even now, five hundred years later, is innovative and captivatingly beautiful. The Visitation speaks a universal language of emotion, motherhood, hope and salvation. Her message at this time is to save her home.[Pontormo's Visitation in Carmignano]This painting resides in a small parish church in Carmignano, a town in Tuscany, about half an hour’s drive from Florence. Long a site of “pilgrimage” for art lovers, Pontormo’s Visitation has embarked on her first American tour with the exhibition “Miraculous Encounters: Pontormo from Drawing to Painting” (Florence - New York - Los Angeles). The purpose of the #VisitingVisitation, as we are calling the voyage of this gift to humanity, is to raise funds for the much-needed restoration of this church.The church and monastic complex of San Michele Arcangelo that is home to Pontormo’s Visitation, one of the most important artworks of its time, is literally falling down. Emergency interventions have taken place to fix holes in the roof of the church when rainwater was entering close to the painting, but this is just the most visible and alarming sign of widespread structural damage to the large complex, which includes a cloister, oratory and additional internal spaces.[The church interior with Pontormo's painting on the right]We have a plan - described in detail below - to restore the heart of the complex - the house of the Visitation; preserve the painting for future generations of Carmignanesi; and give life to the Museum of the Visitation so that art-loving visitors from around the world can come admire this work in its home for years to come.[One of the many sections of the convent in which it is unsafe to enter]We are asking you to become a part of this project and help save this church and convent from ruin. Please contribute by donating any amount, either freely or by selecting one of the rewards at the right hand side of this page [see this post for rewards details].The loan of Pontormo’s Visitation in order to be the starring masterpiece of the exhibition “Miraculous Encounters: Pontormo from Drawing to Painting” has permitted further study of the painting and deepened our understanding both of the artist, and of how this work came to be in our church in Carmignano. Bruce Edelstein, curator of the exhibit and Coordinator for Graduate Programs and Advanced Research at New York University Florence, presents a new hypothesis about the patronage and dating of the work. In short, the work was likely commissioned by Bonaccorso Pinadori and executed in the period 1528-30, in which Florence was under siege and the city was governed by a short-lived Republic before it was once again taken over by the Medici family, who would then consolidate their rule, becoming Dukes and then Grand Dukes of Tuscany for the following 200 years. [Carmignano from above, with the church at its center]The painting was not made for the church in Carmignano, but, Edelstein suggests, was commissioned for a Franciscan church outside of the city walls which was destroyed during the siege. Thus, the owner, who was a Medici enemy, took it to the family villa in Carmignano, where they had a private chapel. It is documented here in 1677, and then next mentioned in our church in 1720. It may have been transferred there when, that same year, the Pinadori family sold the villa. It was made to fit an altar frame that was designed for another painting, perhaps once promised by the now financially unfortunate Pinadori family.While Pontormo’s panel was not made for the church in Carmignano, it certainly found an ideal location in this Franciscan setting and became particularly important to this community. For more than two hundred years, it never left the church; afterwards, it has only traveled to Florence, for restoration and a handful of exhibitions. Travel has only ever been authorized for the good of the painting, in terms of scientific study, restoration, and now fundraising.The Church of San Michele is said to have been founded on land donated to Saint Francis himself in 1211. An oratory and friary were built, and expanded with the current church in the first half of the fourteenth century. Another expansion took place in the eighteenth century.[The exterior of the church]In the modern period, lack of funds has led to the progressive degradation of the building, in particular in structural terms. The vertical pilasters that support the building require consolidation since they risk collapse, while the wooden structure of the roof has been attacked by parasites and affected by water damage. Continued rainwater exposure to all the parts of the complex, due to the inadequate roof, has affected structural aspects as well as damaged architectural and painted decoration. Temporary measures have been taken from 1994 until now to patch holes in the roof and to hold up walls and floors, rendering numerous areas inaccessible.[From above you can see where the roof is caving in, and part of it is green plastic sheeting]We remember times when the beautiful cloister held joyous celebrations of marriages and baptisms; when the complex provided a useful and free meeting space for youth groups and community activities. We want to get back to that, to once again have wedding parties in this space, and to welcome new visitors and types of festivities through a new museum.[Our group of volunteers recently cleaned the cloister so we could hold fundraising concerts here! It hadn't been open to the public in almost two decades.]Our hope is to be able to finance a full restoration of the complex, but we’ve structured our plan bit by bit, over the long term. The church will always be the fulcrum of community events, and it will also take on a new role as the Museum of the Visitation.
The first goal will be to secure the church and make sure that the painting, when it returns home from its American voyage, will be safe and dry. 
Second, we’re renovating an area on the ground floor adjacent to the church, to become an exhibition space, event space, and visitor welcome center.
An intervention on the Oratory of San Luca will permit it to be reopened to the public. With time, regular prayer services will be moved to this more intimate space, permitting tourist visits in the main church to not disturb prayer.

The intention is to create a space in which to prepare the visitor for viewing the painting by Pontormo in its original location inside the church. The Museo della Visitazione will also house reproductions, videos, and temporary exhibitions, as well as offer visitor services.To restore the entire complex is a long term project requiring substantial funding. We are concentrating on the section that we wish to open up to the public in the short term.

Hello! My name is Brandon Stewart and I am an artist from Seattle, Washington. For over 10 years I have made my living as a freelance illustrator, pyrographer (woodburning) and tattoo artist. 
A few years ago, I came to Indiegogo looking for help to get to Spectrum Fantastic Art Live, a collection of some of the finest sci-fi/fantasy artists in the world. I had been accepted to exhibit at this event, and you all came through and helped me achieve my goal. And what an experience it was! I couldn't have thanked you all enough.

That's a variable rate of $420-840 in motel bills. I'm not trying to stay in fancy places, just ones without bugs.
Supplies
Supplies for this trip will include everything from art prints to food. While I have most of the materials necessary to do this show (things like a table, table cloth, bins...etc), there are some things I need to update:

I absolutely need a new banner for my booth. 
I want to step up my prints and get some fancier ones made of my art
I am happy with how I set up my table, but I would like to get some displays that allow me to show more stuff because I have expanded what I do since my last time at Spectrum. 

New business cards (already designed).

It consists of cubes connected in a three-dimensional structure. You can manipulate it to change shapes in different ways. It is made from a system of pieces that lock together. When you want to try another design, you simply take it apart and build a different one using the exact same pieces. No matter if you are developing probes for you next Mars mission, constructing skyscrapers, or looking at atomic structures for nano technology, GHOSTKUBES can serve as an inspiration and a tool for creativity. What you see in the film is NOT a 3D printed prototype, it is a finished product from an industrial mold. I wanted to be 100% sure that I could offer a product that worked exactly as I intended.

<p><strong>DETAILS OF THE PROJECT</strong>: The inPrint Collective will be embarking on a four-month exhibition project in partnership with the Scarborough Historical Museum (the SHM), to run from May to August 2012.  While the culmination of our work together will be a show featuring work by members of inPrint and curated by member Kim Dayman, the Collective sees this project as an opportunity to fully engage with a Toronto-based partner in culture such as the SHM that incorporates the on-going production/preservation/interpretation of history while engaging with and contributing to the artistic mosaic of our city. </p>
<p>The theme of the exhibition is the shared history and the development of ‘memories’ within the Scarborough neighbourhood served by the SHM. The artists of inPrint will organize and participate in a show that explores various conceptualizations of memories, recollections, and changing spaces, negotiating narratives of “the past” as presented and preserved by the SHM. We will create new work that bridges our own personal considerations with the show’s theme, drawing from the rich resources on hand at the SHM. We will be working closely with the Museum’s ‘Community Memories Kiosk’, a project that encourages visitors and neighbourhood residents to contribute stories of their own recollections and experiences of Scarborough, and actively participating in building its history.We will mount the exhibition mainly in SHM's gallery space, seen in our video, but will also present our work throughout the site. As well, inPrint will contribute to the ‘Community Memories Kiosk’ by sharing our experiences working with the SHM, as we make our own mark on the museum. Other sources of insight and inspiration from the SHM will be inspired by the site’s architecture, artifacts and restored gardens.</p>
<p>  <strong>COMMUNITY SHARING: </strong>As part of our work in integrating this exhibition with the space, we will run a series of printmaking demonstrations at the SHM available to the public as part of their programming. As well, inPrint will be imparting their printmaking skills to the youth volunteer team at the SHM, who can then integrate print projects when they design their art camp programs at the Museum. We hope this skills-sharing will also foster a love of printmaking to the volunteers, who may one day be future members and leaders of the inPrint Collective. </p>
<p>We see this project as a bridge between fine arts and community outreach. The SHM's mandate is to serve its community, and we believe this project will contribute to that goal.  This show is scheduled to be concurrent with the Museum's celebration of Multicultural Day, in which the Museum will track the site's rich, ever developing history through the lens of immigration.</p>
<p>For more information about the inPrint Collective and to have a look at other projects we've done, check out our website at<a href=""http://inprintstudio.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> http://inprintstudio.ca.</a> Past events include demonstrations in the last two Culture Days festivals (2010, 2011), as well as participation in Open Studio's international conference on printmaking, Printopolis (2010). </p>
<p><strong>WHY WE'RE FUNDRAISING:</strong> Part of inPrint's mandate has been to support artists, which includes not only providing exhibition opportunities and skills development but also financial compensation. In order to be able to devote our time to doing this project well, artists have to be paid for their time. Though we are a group of committed artists, we also have to work day jobs in order to fund our practices and pay our bills. Being able to pay artist fees, in accordance to<a href=""http://www.carfacontario.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> CARFAC</a>, would allow us to take some time off from work to focus on this project properly. We don't expect to sell our work at this exhibition, which is not its major intent anyway, so artist fees would help balance that out. Making art constitutes a lot of labour, and we want to respect that. </p>
<p>We hope to pay fees in the range of $300 to $500 to each participating artist, for a four month exhibition, which includes public workshops. We anticipate that the costs to mount the show will run us approximately $600. This campaign's goals are only towards a portion of our costs, as we have been actively engaging diverse fundraising projects.</p>
<p>As noted in the video, if we make more then asked for, we'd like to realize a dream for inPrint and publish a catalogue of the exhibition, which would be made available both through the Collective and at the Museum. Catalogues are wonderful documents of temporary shows, and would be a way of preserving our involvement with the SHM for future attendants, as well as providing a space for us to contemplate the themes of the show through the catalogue essay. If we make less than our goal, most of the funds will be allocated to the set-up costs of the show.</p>
<p><strong>DONATION REWARDS</strong>: In the higher level donations, we are offering up limited edition work as rewards. Should you donate at this level, we will create limited edition prints inspired by this project just for this reward. A sample of our work is featured in the video, so we hope that whets your appetite for what we're capable of! And we hope you enjoy the prints we've made, just for you!</p>
<p>Can't contribute? That's okay, we'd appreciate a tweet or facebook mention of support towards our cause! IndieGoGo offers a variety of ways to do so--check it out!</p>

<h3>Story</h3>I am an artist living in the rural hills of western Massachusetts. I have been making drawings and paintings ever since I can remember. I got my degree in Art History from the University of Denver and taught art in secondary schools to kids with behavioral and learning issues for a number of years. I now garden and restore vintage posters while continuing to pursue my creative path as a visual artist.<br/><br/><p>This past January while perusing the shelves of a local library I came across a book about textile designs from around the world. I opened the book to a page of Hungarian folk costumes made in the late 1800’s.  The organic designs and bright colors made me gasp with admiration and a sense of deep recognition.  Since that moment, standing there in the library with that book in my hands, I have been on a quest to better understand the imagery found in the peasant and folk arts of Hungary and Poland. In my recent art work I have been exploring these decorative arts and creating images that are inspired by the colors, organic lines, and designs that happen also to be part of my cultural and ancestral background.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">How You Can Help.</span></h3>
<p>This July and August, 2011 I am traveling to Poland and Hungary to study the art and folk art of these two countries as well and meet and visit family and friends. I am able to cover half the cost of my study and travel expenses and I need your help covering the cost of the other half of the study program in Krakow and airfare and train fare expenses. This unique quest will unquestionably support my creative growth, development and work as an artist for many years to come.<br/><br/></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Study &amp; Travel Plan</span></h3>
<p>I arrive in Krakow, Poland on July 3rd to attend a four week long study program at Jagiellonian University which is the second university to be founded in Central Europe way back in 1364.  The course, which is organized through the Kosciuszko Foundation in NYC, is called ""The Art of Poland: Past and Present"" and covers the art history of Poland, folk arts, poster art and contemporary art.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>While in Krakow I plan to forge a connection with the Ethnographic Museum to do independent study on the folk arts of Poland. I will be taking photographs, sketching ideas and researching images, stories and music that will be influential to my future creations. I’m also very much looking forward to meeting and visiting with my family who reside in and around Krakow, as well as sight seeing to get a glimpse of the culture of my ancestors. Spending time with my family in Poland will broaden my understanding of my family and the culture I come from.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In August I will spend time in Hungary with friends and split my time between Budapest and the countryside. I plan to explore various Hungarian folk/peasant art traditions by visiting museums and attending festivals held on weekends during the summer months. My musician friend wants to share traditional Hungarian music and songs with me as well as put me in touch with traditional dancers who live in his countryside village. I will visit Harskut, Hungary, the village my grandfather's family is from. More photographs, sketches, memories, music and paintings will be made during this time.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>I believe that there are parallels between the working class people of
today and the peasants of yesterday. Instead of toiling for land owning
lords we toil for the elite/corporate class. I believe one's
connection to meaningful creativity creates spiritual, mental and physical health ultimately fostering a sense connection within oneself and with the outer world by positively impacting community and relationships.<br/><br/>Culturally, I see a shift of interest from a consumeristic mentality to an interest in the cultivation of local economies through the production and consumption of handmade, homegrown products, goods, food and arts. I am interested in traditional cultures and how they created meaning and beauty in their lives before big box stores, factory assembly lines and mass consumption. How were the personal, the spiritual and the beautiful created and shared?<br/><br/>I believe that we find a deeper meaning in life through the creation and appreciation of beauty. I imagine that my ancestors, the peasants of Poland and Hungary, created many things of beauty and meaning despite leading lives full of back breaking work for the benefit of the upper class. Wood working, paper cuts, embroidery, paintings, gardening, music making and story telling gave the peasantry an outlet to create and share stories, folk lore, traditions and beauty. I am looking to re-cultivate this mentality for myself, not only to connect with my personal history but to create homemade things of beauty and meaning, and build new bridges within my community both socially and economically.  <br/><br/>I will create new work to show in community and commercial gallery’s based on my experience. I will share these ideas and what I learn with others through my work and presentations. And I plan to start my own handmade business using my designs.<br/><br/>

</div></div>","StoryI am an artist living in the rural hills of western Massachusetts. I have been making drawings and paintings ever since I can remember. I got my degree in Art History from the University of Denver and taught art in secondary schools to kids with behavioral and learning issues for a number of years. I now garden and restore vintage posters while continuing to pursue my creative path as a visual artist.This past January while perusing the shelves of a local library I came across a book about textile designs from around the world. I opened the book to a page of Hungarian folk costumes made in the late 1800’s.  The organic designs and bright colors made me gasp with admiration and a sense of deep recognition.  Since that moment, standing there in the library with that book in my hands, I have been on a quest to better understand the imagery found in the peasant and folk arts of Hungary and Poland. In my recent art work I have been exploring these decorative arts and creating images that are inspired by the colors, organic lines, and designs that happen also to be part of my cultural and ancestral background.
How You Can Help.
This July and August, 2011 I am traveling to Poland and Hungary to study the art and folk art of these two countries as well and meet and visit family and friends. I am able to cover half the cost of my study and travel expenses and I need your help covering the cost of the other half of the study program in Krakow and airfare and train fare expenses. This unique quest will unquestionably support my creative growth, development and work as an artist for many years to come.
Study & Travel Plan
I arrive in Krakow, Poland on July 3rd to attend a four week long study program at Jagiellonian University which is the second university to be founded in Central Europe way back in 1364.  The course, which is organized through the Kosciuszko Foundation in NYC, is called ""The Art of Poland: Past and Present"" and covers the art history of Poland, folk arts, poster art and contemporary art.

While in Krakow I plan to forge a connection with the Ethnographic Museum to do independent study on the folk arts of Poland. I will be taking photographs, sketching ideas and researching images, stories and music that will be influential to my future creations. I’m also very much looking forward to meeting and visiting with my family who reside in and around Krakow, as well as sight seeing to get a glimpse of the culture of my ancestors. Spending time with my family in Poland will broaden my understanding of my family and the culture I come from.

In August I will spend time in Hungary with friends and split my time between Budapest and the countryside. I plan to explore various Hungarian folk/peasant art traditions by visiting museums and attending festivals held on weekends during the summer months. My musician friend wants to share traditional Hungarian music and songs with me as well as put me in touch with traditional dancers who live in his countryside village. I will visit Harskut, Hungary, the village my grandfather's family is from. More photographs, sketches, memories, music and paintings will be made during this time.

</div></div>","Our Story

Originating in New Orleans, White Linen Night started as a way for local businesses to connect with the community and each other. After Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, several business owners and artists came to the Houston area and set up shops in the Heights. White Linen Night in the Heights founders and local business owners saw an opportunity to bring that same sense of community and entrepreneurship to the Heights to showcase the best the Heights has to offer - wonderful homes, great shops, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, service businesses, hike & bike trails and the general ambiance that has made the Heights one of the most sought after areas to live in Houston. WLNH proceeds benefit the art programming for Houston Art & Culture, a 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation. Their mission is to create & support artistic inspiration in our community through scholarships and mentoring.



The Impact

This year White Linen Night in the Heights has teamed up with Fresh Arts Coalition and Fitzgerald's in a collaborative effort to connect Houston performing and visual artists to the 30,000+ projected attendees of this annual event. Fresh Arts Coalition is a 501(c)3 non-profit collective of the most original and thought-provoking arts groups in Houston - the distinctive organizations that make the city’s arts scene one of the most dynamic in the country. 



What We Need & What You Get

Help us reach our goal of $3000 to support the artists’ fees and production needs to allow us to showcase the arts organizations and local artists that make Houston and the Heights special as well as one of the most appealing places for Artists to live and create. All donations are tax deductible to the full extent of the law.

<p></p>
<p>Kara:<br/>
I have lived in Pensacola, FL all of my life. I am a lover of animals, tea,
health food, and meditation.  I feel that I need a change of scenery to
free my spirit.<br/><br/>
Kristen:<br/>
Kristen has been living on her own since she was 16!  Since then she has
lived in many places.  Kristen loves poetry, cats, and social justice. She
occasionally feels the need to move to a new city to stay inspired for her
artwork.<br/><br/>
Obviously, you are not obligated to help us move to Portland.  We are
simply looking for some good Samaritans that might help us pave the way to our
new life.<br/><br/>
We truly feel that if we achieve our goal, we will flourish in a city where we
can become the people we wish to be.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>

This colossal Yin-Yang symbol will rise from the Playa**, solemnly inviting all to slow down, zoom out, and attune to the ineffable magnitude of present reality and its perpetual state of flux.

The Yin-Yang symbol represents the balanced unison of complimentary aspects of everything in the universe. It is an all-encompassing holistic dyad: one cannot exist without the other, nothing is ever unilateral - a positive manifests in contrast to a negative. The seed of the one is found in the other - thus the juxtaposition of dots in each component. Like tides and Sun, the Yin and Yang within us are in a constant interplay of rising and setting.

<br/><p>Deliberately minimalist stylistically, this monolithic installation appeals to potent primordial undercurrents of human spirit.

Thresholds of paramount significance need not be complicated. </p>
<div>
<div>INTERACTIVITY:<p></p>
<p>Deviating from the commonplace notion of interactivity, The Supreme Ultimate ventures beyond physical, material and tactile functions to evoke within us the visceral and ineffable, to help us connect to our outward environment and inner core with profundity and equanimity often lost in the dust amidst all the hustle and bustle. A serene oasis where the serendipity of the Playa manifests itself in ways unique to each individual, this installation is a fulcrum between questions and answers. Intuit, establish and embrace your wholesome equilibrium in its vicinity.<br/></p>
<p>ODE TO PATRONS:</p>
<p>And now you have the opportunity to help make The Supreme Ultimate a beneficial gift for all to partake! Deepest gratitude to those of you who stepped up and showed support for this project in the original campaign. Setbacks happen, so we're trying again! Please take this opportunity to contribute and know that you have helped deliver meaningful and healing art to enhance the Playa experience of upwards of 60 thousand people! Any help that you can give now will make my winter a little less cold and long.</p>

<p>Why help us transform into a Clay Center?  Well if you love the arts,  love seeing beautiful handmade things, love pottery, love helping young artists succeed, love having master craftsmen in your midst, love giving kids who would never get a chance to make something beautiful, then we think the new District Clay Center could be worthy of your support.</p>
<p>We want to spread the joy of making something with your hands to the entire Washington community. From art lovers, to community students, underserved kids, master craftsmen (and women), young emerging artists, educators, and academics; we want to create a place where this wonderful medium can thrive and grow.  </p>
<p>We need to raise $10,000 to finance our build-out so that ceramic artists in DC have a place to take the next step. Furthermore, we want to create a nationally recognized gallery and also help fund our new Community Clay! program for underserved youth. You can see a specific list of how District Clay will benefit from your donations below and also some great rewards as a thank you for all your support. <i>District Clay will make a one to one match for every dollar raised.</i>  </p>
</div><div>
<p>We have gotten tremendous support from the ceramic community and especially from our own students and community artists at District Clay. They have already put in hundreds of free hours to help our build-out succeed. We have an incredibly committed volunteer base and we are confident that we will be able to raise the money we need to make the Center a financial success.  District Clay has developed a sound business plan that expects the Center will grow at a moderate pace in our new much larger (6,400 square foot) space.  </p>
<p>Here are the some of the specific things we need to finance:</p>
<p>- A second large electric kiln (18.5 cu ft) and a glaze test kiln.</p>
<p>- Four new wheels (including 2 Brent EXs).</p>
<p>- A Raku kiln.</p>
<p>- 6 large warecarts.</p>
<p>- Venting for our gas kiln (very $$$).</p>
<p>- A large Peter Pugger Clay Mixer/Pugger.</p>
<p>- Buildout for our new Gallery Space.</p>
<p>- Help with financing our Community Clay! program.</p>
<p>Please help us transform into something spectacular.  We have already had over 850 students come through District Clay's door over the past 2 1/2 years.</p>
<p><strong>With your help and backing, we will give thousands of additional people from our community the opportunity to make making beautiful things with their own hands.  Please contribute now!</strong></p>

</div></div>","Why help us transform into a Clay Center?  Well if you love the arts,  love seeing beautiful handmade things, love pottery, love helping young artists succeed, love having master craftsmen in your midst, love giving kids who would never get a chance to make something beautiful, then we think the new District Clay Center could be worthy of your support.
We want to spread the joy of making something with your hands to the entire Washington community. From art lovers, to community students, underserved kids, master craftsmen (and women), young emerging artists, educators, and academics; we want to create a place where this wonderful medium can thrive and grow.  
We need to raise $10,000 to finance our build-out so that ceramic artists in DC have a place to take the next step. Furthermore, we want to create a nationally recognized gallery and also help fund our new Community Clay! program for underserved youth. You can see a specific list of how District Clay will benefit from your donations below and also some great rewards as a thank you for all your support. District Clay will make a one to one match for every dollar raised.  

We have gotten tremendous support from the ceramic community and especially from our own students and community artists at District Clay. They have already put in hundreds of free hours to help our build-out succeed. We have an incredibly committed volunteer base and we are confident that we will be able to raise the money we need to make the Center a financial success.  District Clay has developed a sound business plan that expects the Center will grow at a moderate pace in our new much larger (6,400 square foot) space.  
Here are the some of the specific things we need to finance:
- A second large electric kiln (18.5 cu ft) and a glaze test kiln.
- Four new wheels (including 2 Brent EXs).
- A Raku kiln.
- 6 large warecarts.
- Venting for our gas kiln (very $$$).
- A large Peter Pugger Clay Mixer/Pugger.
- Buildout for our new Gallery Space.
- Help with financing our Community Clay! program.
Please help us transform into something spectacular.  We have already had over 850 students come through District Clay's door over the past 2 1/2 years.
With your help and backing, we will give thousands of additional people from our community the opportunity to make making beautiful things with their own hands.  Please contribute now!

</h3> <p>Yorick is a Calavera - is a playful rendering in wood of a Mexican sugar skull.  <br/></p>
<p>The original Mexican sugar skulls have an element of ephemera - frequently created to recognize a passed loved one around the Dia de Muertos (Day of the Dead). Colorful, Evocative.  Created for a celebration and then discarded or eaten.  <br/></p>
<p>This piece was created, designed, and built to reflect that ephemera. <br/></p>
<p>Yorick consists of cut plywood in a basic geodesic dome shape, assembled with hinges, maximizing 
portability, minimizing assembly requirements.  <br/></p>
<p>During the day, the 
Calavera looks cute but kinda plain:  a 10 ft tall, 10 ft diameter unpainted plywood skull with cut out flowers and a sporty mustache.  At night, though, the skull is lit up from inside.  Projection is used to paint the external surfaces with light.  The photo and video show the crazy colors and designs that can be attained through projection techniques.  <br/></p>
<p>It is going to cost more than expected to get the Calavera to the Playa and burn it safely.  You have to meet certain guidelines before you can burn art at Burning Man.</p>
<p>Yorick is scheduled to burn on Friday night, Saturday morning at 1 am.  You are invited to attend the burning.<br/></p>

<br/><h3>BarCamp 2 - the awesomeness continues!</h3>
<p>For those of you who didn't attend last year's BarCamp, you may be asking yourself - what IS BarCamp?  Do I have to visit a tavern?  </p>
<p>Heavens no!  BarCamp is all about giving and getting ideas - one person holds a session on a topic they're passionate about, and others listen and participate. Then, someone else who attends talks about something else, and others listen and contribute.  That's what the event is - you share your idea, and your head is filled with new ones!  Like the photo above says - it's an idea swap meet for the info-curious.  Here's the Prezi for more information: <a href=""http://prezi.com/5hd4nc6onijm/barcamp-fond-du-lac/#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://prezi.com/5hd4nc6onijm/barcamp-fond-du-lac/#</a></p>

On November 8, 2014, we completed the final house -- check out this awesome :30 video that chronicles the build, http://youtu.be/bf_5Tfgh-n4The transformation of Tabunok from an overgrown lot filled with tents and broken dreams to a vibrant community of homes with a bright future continues with The Peace Center which will serve  as the epicenter of this community’s transformation -- we'll expand the co-operative that we started, a weekly Farmer's market will take place selling (amongst other things) organic fruits and vegetables that are being grown in the community, vocational training will be brought in, the center will host arts and cultural programs, and micro-lending will begin -- all designed to turn a terrible tragedy into an enormous opportunity for abundance and prosperity.Our work in Tabunok serves a purpose that will touch lives far outside of the Philippines, however.  Our goal is to refine this community building model and then apply it here in the United States as part of The Peace Project's most ambitious program yet, the Veterans Independence Project, an initiative to put 1,000 homeless Los Angeles Veterans in houses by July 4, 2017.Your support is not only appreciated by us, it will help change the lives of people who, not so long ago, thought their lives might be over.  PLUS: it will give us much needed momentum to launch our Veterans program and give a hand up to those who gave so much and in many cases, got so little in return.So lean forward, select a perk that has been lovingly created and generously donated by one of the many artists and organizations whose support has made it possible for us to change tens of thousands of lives in only four years, and join us on this incredible ride where through the power of the people, dedication, lots of work and a little magic, we continue to prove that:""Through creativity and community, we can change the world.""$50 PERK:  ""We Must Stop Believing the Problems are Too Big"" Women's T$50 PERK:  ""We Must Stop Believing the Problems are Too Big"" Men's T$50 PERK:  Moon & Star Earrings$50 PERK:  Inspire Print by Kaleo Sallas, 18"" x 14""$50 PERK:  Peace Necklace$50 PERK:  Patti Meyer's 8"" x 8"" Heart Painting on Canvas$75 PERK:  Sterling & Tanzanite Cluster Earrings$100 PERK:  All the Love in the World by Jesse Hunter, 12"" x 12"" on Wood$150 PERK:  Date Chocolate WeWood Watch$150 PERK:  Photo from Adam Rose Photography, 20"" x 16"" with matte$125 PERK:  Prismacolor Pencils$500 PERK:  2 night stay at Lake Arrowhead Resort & Spa",18.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>About me:</h3>
<p>Hello! If you do not know me already, my name is Shiela Diolosa and I am an artist residing in San Francisco, California. I attend the San Francisco Art Institute for my BFA in Painting and currently work at Exploratorium, the best interactive museum that combines both science and art practices. I also tutor children in Math and English at a local, low-income elementary school. I strive to make the best of each day and believe that staying positive is the best thing you can do for yourself. I love living here in the Bay Area and have met so many fun and amazing people. </p>
<p>However, not every one means well. I have recently become the victim of a scam (from an ""art dealer"") and want to bring awareness to these issues. It is both devastating and emotionally draining and I would not wish for anyone else to be put in this situation. I was assigned to be a personal assistant and was given a check to cash, including the money for my ""weekly salary."" The job descriptions stated that I would be doing in-home purchasing and mailing to various art collectors on a warehouse level. Then I got a phone call saying that I needed to take some of the money and wire it because his ""art materials seller"" needed to make a last minute purchase and it was urgent. The bank had cleared the funds after two days so I thought everything was okay and I had been talking to this man for 3 weeks before anything was even sent. ALL BAD! Then, before I knew it, the bank had returned the check and it was too late for me to get anything back. </p>
<p>I want myself and others to learn from mistakes like these and know that for every evil person out there, there are three times as many of those who are really genuine. </p>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>I know this may be a longshot but I want to restore faith in the random act of human kindness. Maybe someone out there who is hurting in a similiar sense will see this know that everything will be okay. Getting scammed is embarassing and difficult to talk about but the first step is knowing that you are not alone. My hope is that someday there will be a relief fund and community for those who are in the same situation. The more we publicize, the closer we are to getting people aware and finding those committing the crimes. </p>

<p>My campaign is ONLY for the $2500 that was lost, nothing more. By helping out, I am giving the gift of my passions.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is SzeYun Lo and I'm an Artist and Graphic Designer in Vancouver, BC and I have been studying art since the age of 11 and Art has been a part of my life ever since. I specialize in two traditional styles of art, one is Oriental watercolor and the other is carbon powder art. The style of Oriental watercolor painting I specialize in is called Lingnan, it's origins from china it was created as a fusion of art from the North and South of the Orient. Myself being a Canadian, a lot of my art today is a fusion of the East and West.</p>
<p>I am currently planning to hold my first solo art exhibition <a href=""http://www.syloarts.com/events-rtb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">'Release the Butterflies'</a> open to the public, On July 13, 2013 in downtown Vancouver. I am doing so for a number of reasons. One, it is one of my life goals to hold my own art show, but more importantly I have decided to host my own exhibition due to the fact that I may be one of the youngest remaining Lingnan artists in the Greater Vancouver area. Although a lot of parents may put their children into art classes, a large percentage of them after graduating high school cease to continue the art due to the lack of time they have to devote to the art. During the years I must confess that even I have stopped once and a while, but I still practice time to time pushing the art style onto different mediums and even products. Over the last few years I've been exposing a lot of myself and my art onto social media to draw attention and peak interests to this dying art style. This art show will be a large milestone in my life, it will be my first official art show and it will be showcasing artwork I've done throughout my artistic life.</p>
<p>For more information about 'Release the Butterflies' and about me and my art history, you can visit: <a href=""http://www.syloarts.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.syloarts.com</a></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many Canadians feel that it is difficult to hold on to our roots as we integrate and live in a multicultural society. I simply believe it is exposure. It is not because there is a lack of interest, but there is a lack of availability. Many times, there are certain barriers. Many older generations believe that the younger generations are losing touch and lack knowledge of their own heritage and cultural roots. Many today don't know how to speak, read, or write their mother tongue, even I cannot read or write Chinese very well, because of the fact that I've been - how some will say, 'Westernized'. However I am still knowledgeable in other ways and have been educated in my cultures art and this is my way of holding on to my roots, heritage and culture.  I want to assure older generations that there are still those of us out there that are young and knowledgeable of our traditions. We are simply facing a new generation of difficulties and now must seek out innovative solutions to evolve ourselves to adapt.</p>
<p>In 2006 - I became very aware of the cultural loss in the arts community as I was participating in various art shows around the city of Vancouver. I realized that fewer and fewer younger generations were studying and learning the traditional Oriental arts that I've come to fall in love with. In the Spring of 2006 I took a large leap of faith and entered the Arts Institute of Vancouver to study graphic design so that I may have the skills to push the art that I practiced and knew to the next level. I learned the skills and knowledge to try to expose the art in different ways and to superimpose the art onto items and products in the form of graphics. I did so successfully in 2008 when I was approached by a stainless steel water bottle company seeking artwork . I did two designs for them in the style of traditional Oriental watercolor painting which became their top selling designs.</p>

<p>At my art show, I hope to inspire younger generations and make those of my generation aware of our dying culture in the arts. I want to also introduce to the world a group of people who are also my dear friends (Desi Method) that have come together over the years to support one another in the arts. Individually we all have different specializations in the Arts: Fine arts, Music, Music  Production, Photography, Interactive Arts, Graphic Arts and even Martial Arts. We are young and we exist, and are promoting our culture, heritage and roots through what we do.</p>
<p>Perhaps my event will open up the minds of traditional thinkers and encourage the idea about the application of a traditional arts onto different mediums to bring the traditional art style of Oriental watercolor to the next level. Maybe one day I will have the opportunity to teach and educate the public and future generations, but at the moment I simply want to share with you and the world my art.</p>
<p>This is only the first stepping stone to building a path to which I hope will lead to many more.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
My name is SzeYun Lo and I'm an Artist and Graphic Designer in Vancouver, BC and I have been studying art since the age of 11 and Art has been a part of my life ever since. I specialize in two traditional styles of art, one is Oriental watercolor and the other is carbon powder art. The style of Oriental watercolor painting I specialize in is called Lingnan, it's origins from china it was created as a fusion of art from the North and South of the Orient. Myself being a Canadian, a lot of my art today is a fusion of the East and West.
I am currently planning to hold my first solo art exhibition 'Release the Butterflies' open to the public, On July 13, 2013 in downtown Vancouver. I am doing so for a number of reasons. One, it is one of my life goals to hold my own art show, but more importantly I have decided to host my own exhibition due to the fact that I may be one of the youngest remaining Lingnan artists in the Greater Vancouver area. Although a lot of parents may put their children into art classes, a large percentage of them after graduating high school cease to continue the art due to the lack of time they have to devote to the art. During the years I must confess that even I have stopped once and a while, but I still practice time to time pushing the art style onto different mediums and even products. Over the last few years I've been exposing a lot of myself and my art onto social media to draw attention and peak interests to this dying art style. This art show will be a large milestone in my life, it will be my first official art show and it will be showcasing artwork I've done throughout my artistic life.
For more information about 'Release the Butterflies' and about me and my art history, you can visit: www.syloarts.com

<h3><strong>About The Project</strong></h3>
<p>Hello! Thanks so much for checking out my project. The idea is very simple. As a designer (and as the dude who started this whole logo design project craze), I love creating logos. And after completing three successful logo projects on Kickstarter, I thought it would be fun to see what might happen one more time on Indiegogo. The concept for the project is easy; I'll design a whole bunch of different logos, for a whole bunch of different people. That's it. Each contributer will receive a unique, custom and professionally designed logo. It could be a personal logo for their name, or a logo for their business, band, website, Facebook, Twitter, blog, etc. Pretty much anything (nothing obscene or inappropriate though ... and let's go ahead and avoid anything that promotes Satan or things that Satan may like as well ... Trust me, I've been asked to design some crazy things in the past). Then, all of the logos will be displayed at <a href=""http://alotmorelogos.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">alotmorelogos.com</a>. Why display them? Because each logo will then link to a specific URL that the contributer gets to choose... It could be their own Facebook page, Twitter account, website, etc. (again, nothing obscene or inappropriate). Depending on the number of backers, this project could be pretty huge. In the end, I think it would be so cool to see hundreds of logos displayed on the site. You can check out the results from my previous three design projects to get a better idea of what I'm talking about:</p>

<p><a href=""http://abunchoflogos.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">abunchoflogos.com</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>About The Logos</strong></h3>
<p>After the funding period, I'll reach out to each contributer and ask that they submit detailed information about the logo they'd like to have designed. Please note that there is one reward level ($150) that includes a round of revisions based on the contributer's feedback. Let's face it, $25 is really, really cheap for a logo. Therefore, revisions aren't included in those lower levels of funding. With that in mind, you may want to go for the $150 level if think you'd like to have revisions. Again, at the lower levels of funding, once the logo is finished and sent, that's it.  No re-do's. However, at each contribution level I am absolutely committed to designing unique and quality logos that serve the needs of the contributer. In addition, I refuse to produce anything that I wouldn't want my name attached to. Plus, so far, I've had A LOT of satisfied contributers who've been happy with the logo they received. If you have any questions about the design process then just let me know.</p>
<p>Also, in the event that this project actually takes off and receives a lot of contributers, I want to let everyone know in advance that the number of hours spent on each individual logo may be limited. Just imagine if for some crazy reason hundreds of people contributed to this project ... It could potentially take a pretty long time (maybe longer than October) to finish them all. However, that would be pretty awesome, and a lot of fun. I think that's where the really interesting part of these projects comes into play ... Designing consistently good logos in a limited amount of time. As always, I'm excited to push my inspiration and creativity to new limits.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>About The Funding</strong></h3>
<p>Overall, you can think of it this way; contributers get a unique, custom designed logo, while I get a really sweet design project.</p>
<p>Since funds from just one contributer directly cover the production of one logo, I simply set the funding level at $50. If there is just two backers at the $25 level, or one backer at the $50 level, then I'll consider the project a success. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Backing For Multiple Logos</strong></h3>
<p>In the past, I've had numerous people contribute for multiple logos. For example, if they want two $25 logos, then they've pledged $50 in the $25 category. Please feel free to do so.</p>
<h3><strong>A Creative And Unique Gift</strong></h3>
<p>In the past, I've had many contributers give a logo as a gift to a friend or loved one. A logo might just be the perfect gift for that special someone in your life :) And that’s all there is to it.</p>
<h3><strong>Thank You</strong></h3>

<p>Emergence of Spirit came into being because I had a dream when I came to the city of Dubuque. I had no idea at the time what it exactly looked like but I just knew that my passion for living needed a way to be shared with the world. I've always been interested in theater and music but never really had a particular niche to pursue. After graduating from Capri in 2002 and working in the field for almost ten years, I wasn't finding the fulfillment of my dream until I was approached by a local artist about applying for a grant for a project idea...and about nine months later, I had formed a vision for a runway show that involved styrofoam take-out boxes, avante gard hair, &amp; people interested in a different art form than what we've seen in this area. I did not receive the grant, but the flame had been ignited and my dream was beginning to play out in reality. I planned the event with what little resources I had, and put on an outrageous show in three weeks time.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>First year, I did the costumes myself and got a few other cosmetologists to join me in presenting models as works of art to a live audience.

Emergence of Spirit came into being because I had a dream when I came to the city of Dubuque. I had no idea at the time what it exactly looked like but I just knew that my passion for living needed a way to be shared with the world. I've always been interested in theater and music but never really had a particular niche to pursue. After graduating from Capri in 2002 and working in the field for almost ten years, I wasn't finding the fulfillment of my dream until I was approached by a local artist about applying for a grant for a project idea...and about nine months later, I had formed a vision for a runway show that involved styrofoam take-out boxes, avante gard hair, & people interested in a different art form than what we've seen in this area. I did not receive the grant, but the flame had been ignited and my dream was beginning to play out in reality. I planned the event with what little resources I had, and put on an outrageous show in three weeks time.
What We Need & What You Get
First year, I did the costumes myself and got a few other cosmetologists to join me in presenting models as works of art to a live audience. We generated enough money to cover our costs for the project, and that was about it. The next year, we set out to win the grant again, but once again walked away without the cash and depended on the money coming in through the door in order to pay everyone for their time, efforts, & supplies. Though the crowd was double the size of year one, and the price was brought up, we also had more people working with the project [including 2 costume designers & 3 makeup artists] and still only managed to pay the primary designers a minimal amount for all the energy they contributed to the show & ended up with 80% of those involved volunteering their time.

Why Support



Armenia’s
current art schools (colleges, fine arts institutes, universities, etc.)
exclusively teach the traditional means of art with Soviet methodology. Due to
this, there has been an unfortunate stall in the field’s modernizing culture
and technological advancement. As a way to challenge that, supporting this

growing arts, but the social progress that enhances society’s knowledge of this
vast discipline.

Through
Medialab, our students will have the chance to familiarize themselves with the
local and global contexts of art and meet with local and foreign artists,
photographers, camera operators, critics and curators.
For a country like Armenia, it is absolutely a one of a kind opportunity for its youth.We've already had four groups of students. Here are the photos from the last graduation ceremony in May 2013.This project is valuable to the world because it will broaden the international artistic pool with talent that can introduce new ideas and contribute to this creative field. After all, Medialab is an example of how a small motivated group can work together and achieve great results.

These are my first major out-of-state shows, and I need your help getting me there and making them happen.  <br/>  My work largely consists of drawings on paper, marks that populate a page to suggest abstract forms. These textures explore the invisible connections between parallels in our perception of the universe and psychological processes.

elemental conditions, their organization is not crystalline, or

forming- a structure in negative space.  </i><br/><br/>Essentially, I emulate forms from the natural world, which can seem pleasant or challenging depending on the level of scrutiny the viewer employs. <br/><br/>I'm seeking to fund-raise $2000 to cover the cost of travel, transportation, food, lodging, materials, etc. I'm selling my work at affordable prices in order to show my appreciation for your contribution!<br/><p></p>

Dennis Dannel, Jr. here. Everyone who knows me, knows that I'm an actor and a singer. What most people don't know is that I'm also a fine artist. I was born in New Orleans, and moved to NYC about 20 years ago to pursue my acting career. I've done some really cool things in my life. For one thing, I graduated law school and then promptly left it behind, for a life in the Arts. For another, I've acted in over 40 shows on the off-off Broadway and Off Broadway stage; and I've produced over 100 plays on the NY Stage. In fact, my picture was on the front cover of the <i>New York Times</i> Arts Section, when they reviewed the Off Broadway hit, ""Icarus &amp; Aria,"" which I produced and had the leading role in.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, exhibiting at The McKenna Museum would be my biggest accomplishment by far. First off, it'll be my triumphant homecoming after 20 years living and working in NYC. But more importantly,  I'll get to introduce myself the Art Community and show the world what I've done and can do. Up until now, only my friends and family have enjoyed my drawings and paintings. This is my chance to be seen and heard in the Art World, and my chance to finally be recognized as a fine artist. <br/></p>
<p>Please help give me a stepping stone into this amazing world. I'm so excited to share the talent I've worked all these years to build. Thank you to the McKenna family for giving me this once in a lifetime opportunity. And thank you to <i>you</i> for helping me to achieve what has always seemed like an unattainable dream! <br/></p>

<p>Lesser Beasts is 56 pages of lovingly watercolor painted scenery and story, following a young girl through a world of swamp creatures and animal spirits on an unconventional and occasionally dark coming-of-age journey.</p>
<p>There is no dialogue or narration, which places added emphasis on the quality and detail of the paintings themselves.The visuals are heavily influenced by nature, specifically swamps and the small creatures that inhabit them. The artist grew up in the forest living near a swamp, and spent many an afternoon collecting frogs and whistling back to birds. The story parallels the struggles with self-worth and feeling 'different' that many people face, with the inherent plight of being a small animal. There are twists, too! You'll have to grab a copy to find out what happens.</p>

</div></div>","Lesser Beasts is 56 pages of lovingly watercolor painted scenery and story, following a young girl through a world of swamp creatures and animal spirits on an unconventional and occasionally dark coming-of-age journey.
There is no dialogue or narration, which places added emphasis on the quality and detail of the paintings themselves.The visuals are heavily influenced by nature, specifically swamps and the small creatures that inhabit them. The artist grew up in the forest living near a swamp, and spent many an afternoon collecting frogs and whistling back to birds. The story parallels the struggles with self-worth and feeling 'different' that many people face, with the inherent plight of being a small animal. There are twists, too! You'll have to grab a copy to find out what happens.



Thanks to support from the Saskatchewan Arts Board, the art for the book is already complete. This is just a pre-order campaign, and does not go to fund any part of the art creation. 

 The goal of this campaign is to produce a small print run of Lesser Beasts to help it reach a wider audience, and to reward some super helpful backers! Since this is my first full-length graphic novel, it is important to me that it be sold not just as an e-book, but also in physical form.
Since this campaign is only a pre-order, there is no risk at all aside from the slight possibility things taking a little longer to ship to me. I have already thoroughly researched a POD service and am confident in ordering the books and producing the rewards in a timely manner.
If we don't meet our financial goal backers will still receive their books and rewards. Similarly, if we get overfunded, I will simply produce more books!   
 By pre-ordering your copy, you'll be helping me:  Get real, physical copies of my first full-length graphic novel Help to support the graphic arts in Canada and Saskatchewan Ensure that I will be able to make Lesser Beasts more widely available 
Help me create new artworks and books in the coming months




Campaign (May 1st - 14th) - During this time you will be able to pre-order the book via IndieGoGo and pre-pay for shipping.
E-content distributed (May 31st) - On May 31st I will make available all of the e-content (e-book copies, bonuses) to backers which selected and paid for them.
Book ordering / Printing (May 18th - July) - I will order the books fairly promptly after the pre-order period ends, and it will take approximately 6-9 weeks from this time for me to receive the books and rewards. 
Shipping out Rewards (Mid July - Early August) - After recieving the physical books and rewards they will be mailed out or made available for pickup by backers as needed, as soon as possible. At this point you will have your complete copy of Lesser Beasts and the campaign will be totally complete!
This time-schedule is very conservative and it is possible that the books will be recieved and shipped out sooner than this, I just don't want to surprise anyone!



Will I be able to purchase the book elsewhere?
The short answer is definitely not for awhile! Depending upon the success of the pre-order, I may produce a small run of additional comics that I will sell at events. But, if you know you'd like a copy I highly recommend pre-ordering to guarantee that you'll be able to get one.

My efforts have taken me from the US to Ireland, Africa, the Netherlands, the West Indies, Russia and India.WHERE & WHEN:Now I've been invited to speak at the Balkan’s Festival for Young Artists, from June 28th – July 1st, 2018.I've also been asked to speak with educators and young people to help develop creative arts programming in the West Indies in August 2018.WHY:I've lived and worked believing two things ... 1) If a child can't imagine what they want to be and do in their future, then they see little value in learning present day academic and ethical lessons.2) If they believe people who are different from them, are the enemy then they're less inclined to seek ways to cooperate and build better communities.In the past my workshops and speaking engagements have been supported by various sources including the US State Department’s Speakers Program.This time is a little different. The organizers can handle my accommodations once I am there, but they do not have the funds to cover my airfare and incidentals.HOW MUCH:Therefore, I’m asking for your help to raise $2500.00 to cover airfare and incidentals. I have approximately 12 days to make this happen.If you can’t donate, please spread the word, or suggest an alternative means for me to obtain the airfare. These invites are both an honor as well as an opportunity to continue my efforts to champion the arts as a more creative and collaborative means of global communication.I truly welcome any help you can give.Thanks for listening.Sincerely,Alex Simmons

We chose the second option. We initiated an internal crowdfunding campaign and collected the needed $12000 among our campmates. We rebuilt everything we have been working for months in Moscow in the US in a couple of weeks. And we managed to bring 'The Intersection' to the Burn last year. It was very hard but very satisfying. Unfortunately, some things didn't work as they were supposed to, for instance, our awesome traffic lights gifs didn't play on the screens, instead the traffic lights showed just random stripes.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562095114/mxyyb4zaccj86rcidyea.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The original Intersection arrived to Los Angeles in a sea container in the last days of August 2018.

<p>I lived in Mongolia from December 2006 to May of 2008 while serving a mission for my church. I was there long enough to go beyond sampling the more readily visible aspects of Mongolian culture and developed a deep appreciation for the Mongolian way of life. I made lasting friendships and learned to speak fluent Mongolian. As a volunteer missionary and English teacher, however, my time was (willingly) not my own and I had little to no opportunity to break out my sketchbook and capture what I was seeing and feeling. I was able to do a few sketches the times I have been back to visit, but there are still hundreds of moments, people, and places that I have longed to sit down and capture on paper.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>In addition to being personally meaningful to me, Mongolia remains somewhat of a mystery to the world at large. Most people think of grassy steppes full of livestock and little round yurts when they think of Mongolia, and most of what I have seen in films, documentaries, photographs, and articles about Mongolia do little to expand on that limited view. They gloss so many subtle but unique stories and focus on those things that seem the most ""foreign"" or exotic to Westerners. Mongolia certainly has a vibrant and exciting culture, but there is so much more to it than what you would see on a postcard. There are things both stranger and more familiar than you would imagine. I hope to convey some of those feelings, subtleties, and stories with my drawings, and give those who view my book the opportunity to replace some of that distant, foreign mystery with a more meaningful look at life in the land of the Eternal Blue Sky.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>After spending three months searching out and sketching the people, scenes, and stories of Mongolia I will be able to organize and compile those sketches into book format which will then be printed and distributed to all you fine people. Some of the sketches will be presented in their raw, journal-like format and some will be scanned and colored. My hope is that in reading and viewing the book you will feel like you were able to travel with me, see what I saw, and experience what I experienced while in Mongolia.</p>

</div><div> <p>In addition to printing and shipping the final book I will need to cover some other costs in order to make this project happen.

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>I'm not trying to bring about world peace with a book of pretty pictures, but...um, maybe? It doesn't matter where you're from, every person is in danger of seeing their own way of life as the only way to live. I traveled halfway around the globe to a people and culture that to all initial appearances have little in common with my own. I didn't come away from it thinking Mongolia was a strange, exotic place, I came away with the realization that I now felt just as at home on the other side of the world as I do in my own hometown. I like the idea of taking foreign things and turning them into familiar ones. The world becomes less of a scary place the more ""homes"" you have. For those of you who aren't planning on hopping on a plane and spending a few months in Mongolia, maybe taking a look at the book will help you to see how Mongolia could be part of your home.</p>
<p>In addition to all those lofty goals, I also just hope to make something that looks real nice. Not everyone can make art for a living, but most people do enjoy<i> living</i> more with healthy doses of art, regular and often. I feel better when I have access to beautiful things, so I hope to put something beautiful in people's hands.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There is a fair amount of risk with any artistic venture. I've tried to think things through and I've gone back and forth between thinking 3 months is way too much and way too little time to spend just drawing. It will require endurance and discipline on my part to keep up a good drawing pace, but I also hope that I will have enough time to draw everything I want to. U.S. citizens can stay in Mongolia for up to 90 days without acquiring a visa. There is a possibility of extending my stay for 30 extra days but I have to wait until I'm in the country to apply and pay a fee. Campaign funds will determine whether or not that is an option.</p>
<p>While I hope to go beyond my goal of $5,000, there is also a risk of not even reaching it. I can modify the project to only go for two months in Mongolia or even just one, but if that is the case I will most likely seek out some other methods of fundraising.</p>
<p>I have estimated the amount of time it will take me to compile the sketches and create the book when I return, but I may find it to be more complicated than I expected. That and the logistics of shipping the book and other perks around the world may take more time than anticipated and I hope you all will be patient with me as I figure these things out as I go.</p>
<p>Lastly, traveling to and living on the other side of the world adds an extra level of risk to every aspect of the project. It makes it harder to predict how much everything will cost, how long it will take, what resources I will have access to when I get there. I have already and will continue to reach out to my friends in Mongolia to try to make sure everything runs as smoothly as possible, but I'm not super great at seeing the future and have to just hope that I will be able to deal with problems as they come up.</p>

It will require endurance and discipline on my part to keep up a good drawing pace, but I also hope that I will have enough time to draw everything I want to. U.S. citizens can stay in Mongolia for up to 90 days without acquiring a visa. There is a possibility of extending my stay for 30 extra days but I have to wait until I'm in the country to apply and pay a fee. Campaign funds will determine whether or not that is an option.
While I hope to go beyond my goal of $5,000, there is also a risk of not even reaching it. I can modify the project to only go for two months in Mongolia or even just one, but if that is the case I will most likely seek out some other methods of fundraising.
I have estimated the amount of time it will take me to compile the sketches and create the book when I return, but I may find it to be more complicated than I expected. That and the logistics of shipping the book and other perks around the world may take more time than anticipated and I hope you all will be patient with me as I figure these things out as I go.
Lastly, traveling to and living on the other side of the world adds an extra level of risk to every aspect of the project. It makes it harder to predict how much everything will cost, how long it will take, what resources I will have access to when I get there. I have already and will continue to reach out to my friends in Mongolia to try to make sure everything runs as smoothly as possible, but I'm not super great at seeing the future and have to just hope that I will be able to deal with problems as they come up.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p>The Transcending Gender project began as a photographic celebration of the lives of transgender and gender non-conforming humans. My passion to capture and celebrate diverse lives came from the belief that one of the reasons transgender and gender non-conforming individuals are not embraced in our society is because of our deeply-rooted cultural gender expectations. Gender expectations that are so engrained into the way we interact with one another they drive many of the decisions we make, including; what we wear, what color our phone case is, how we treat each other, and how we show our emotions. </p>
<p>After capturing stories around the nation, I realized it’s not just transgender and gender non-conforming people who suffer from these expectations: it’s all of us. We should all feel free to be who we want to be, whether it’s how we dress or how we show emotion and affection toward one another. So over the past six months this project has evolved into a photographic series where transgender individuals, and also individuals who are not transgender – literally, everyone and anyone – show we are more than just our gender.</p>

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We have been able to capture more than 35 portraits across the US, but we still have so many more stories to tell and portraits to make! Help us tell more stories and make more portraits across the United States. </p>

show has been a great opportunity to introduce the students and the public of
El Minia to a wide array of contemporary artworks from all over the world and
to introduce our young artists to the world. Year after year our project grows
to connect us to new corners of the world and create bonds among the exhibiting
artists regardless of the geographical, political or cultural barriers. That
artistic interaction can represent a platform for young artists and the public
of various cultural backgrounds to engage in a cultural dialog, exchange ideas
and have a better understanding of the “other”. We believe in the world of

students in collaboration with faculty of fine arts – El Minia university .The
show has been a great opportunity to introduce the students and the public of
El Minia to a wide array of contemporary artworks from all over the world and
to introduce our young artists to the world. Year after year our project grows
to connect us to new corners of the world and create bonds among the exhibiting
artists regardless of the geographical, political or cultural barriers. That
artistic interaction can represent a platform for young artists and the public
of various cultural backgrounds to engage in a cultural dialog, exchange ideas
and have a better understanding of the “other”. We believe in the world of
today , it is absolutely imperative to enhance that sort of cultural interaction. Your contribution to SIPS 15 Camping will help  in  covering  the cost of framing of the artworks , Catalogue publication , customs & postal services , cash awards and the website of the show .

<li>PAPER SHOOTERS™ is highly innovative and provides an entirely new build and play experience unlike anything else. Our shooters are more accurate than other blasters, and you don't need to collect your ammo afterwards- you make it yourself in seconds using ordinary paper! (Make 60 rounds in 45 seconds.)</li>
<li>Awesome interchangeable camo's, real triggers, and ejecting shells.</li>
<li>Ultra safe and unique mess free 100% biodegradable ammo.</li>
<li>More accurate than other ammo types such as foam darts and rubber bands, and also design and print your own camo's.</li>
<li>The problem with designing and building things is that individuals are limited by ability and skill, but not with our construction kits- anybody can produce an awesome looking blaster that shoots really well.</li>
<li>Open source design allows for modding of internals.</li>

<p>We are very different to anything that has been seen before. Firstly, we are a highly detailed model kit which has to be built from scratch with all the components pieced together such as the air chamber, springs, trigger mechanism etc. The mechanism is then covered with an awesome looking specially treated cardboard exterior- again built from scratch, with properties similar to laminated paper, which looks ultra cool, whilst retaining durability.</p>
<p>PAPER SHOOTERS™ has been nearly two years in the making, during which time we have conducted extensive research.

<p>The PAPER SHOOTERS™ designs are much more sophisticated than toy blasters and are definitely geared towards the gamer Call of Duty/ Halo/ Battlefield fan. We wanted to create products that are fun to build, shoot great, and look awesome displayed on a shelf or wall.

<p>Fortunately our team has a huge amount of experience in taking an idea from a concept, an idea in someone’s head- to a product on a shelf in a store. We understand that there are always unforeseen challenges that occur, and have built a really solid plan with that in mind.</p>
<p>Our design is based on a tried and tested method of shooting projectiles- we haven't tried to reinvent the wheel. We have taken the concept and engineered it into a brand new design which is both fun to build and works really well.</p>
<p>Our team consists of ex Nerf and Star Wars designers, so we understand every step of the way in making a fantastic product and placing it into the hands of the consumer. We have been working on this product for over 18 months and it has been quite a journey- starting with sketches, models, prototypes, until we have what you see here: A fantastic quality product that is both fun to build, looks great and performs really well.</p>
<p>The production line is ready to go, we simply need the funds for some final elements of the testing and the initial orders.</p>

If you enjoy building things, and shootingthings- you will love PAPER SHOOTERS™ Construction Kits! Our blasters are supplied in kit form and are made from a specially treated cardboard for durability with a plastic internal shooting mechanism 'skeleton'. They feature ejecting shells and fire paper ammo rounds which you make yourself from ordinary paper, up to 75 feet. There are two models, each with four camo's, which are all interchangeable with the same internal 'skeleton.'
                                   The Original 'Digital Op's' design is back!


PAPER SHOOTERS™ has been brought to life by a very small group. As a young entrepreneurial team we are committed to developing a fantastic product unlike anything that has been seen before. We’ve dedicated 2 years to make this concept a reality, but now need your help in bringing the product to market. 
We’ll use your Indiegogo funds towards: 

1. Product: Final testing and the initial production run
2. Promotion: Marketing and creating public awareness.

Please join us to help launch these ultra cool awesome looking products into the market!




PAPER SHOOTERS™ is highly innovative and provides an entirely new build and play experience unlike anything else. Our shooters are more accurate than other blasters, and you don't need to collect your ammo afterwards- you make it yourself in seconds using ordinary paper! (Make 60 rounds in 45 seconds.)
Awesome interchangeable camo's, real triggers, and ejecting shells.
Ultra safe and unique mess free 100% biodegradable ammo.
More accurate than other ammo types such as foam darts and rubber bands, and also design and print your own camo's.
The problem with designing and building things is that individuals are limited by ability and skill, but not with our construction kits- anybody can produce an awesome looking blaster that shoots really well.
Open source design allows for modding of internals.


 
We understand that it will be difficult not to be grouped into the 'toy blaster' category of products. I know what your thinking- why cardboard? Why not plastic? Why not foam darts or rubber band ammo? We would answer those with:
PAPER SHOOTERS™ is not aimed at the typical blaster market, where rate of fire and ammo capacity is key- lets be honest NERF owns this space and no others really come close.

Comme cette salle donne sur la rue Bergen – trois portes à côté de la galerie principale – le public et les passants pourront assister à cette installation de papier rappelant les affiches de concert punk.
Lors de l'exposition à Brooklyn, Post-Punk Art Now prendra la place qui lui revient au milieu des œuvres exposées : la publication contiendra l’exposition en même temps qu’elle en fera partie – fusion et fission d’une matière esthétique instable.
La création et la diffusion de l’ouvrage seront un geste post- et un geste d'inspiration punk à part entière.

Nous accordons une très grande importance à cette publication, pensée comme un geste artistique pouvant jeter les bases d’un questionnement théorique sur l’influence résiduelle ou actuelle de ce mouvement marquant du 20e siècle.

<p>Cuadro por Danza, festival de video y fotografía de danza, está dirigido y producido por Karla Medina y Bernardette Rodriguez, a través de la labor que realiza la Asociación Civil Cuadro por Danza, sin fines de lucro. Cuadro por Danza es el primer y único festival venezolano que convoca a este tipo de creadores y de contenido, que en su primera edición, en el año 2017, logró una receptividad muy positiva tanto en el público espectador como en los participantes.</p>
<p>Cuadro por Danza busca generar una plataforma en Venezuela para la proyección, promoción y difusión de material fotográfico y audiovisual relacionado con la danza con un alcance nacional e internacional. Nos interesa el desarrollo de espacios de aprendizaje e investigación para la formación de realizadores y espectadores en torno al video y fotografía de danza, y de esta manera incentivar el interés en comunidades y colectivos artísticos.</p>
<p>Para nosotras es importante y dependemos del apoyo que puedan ofrecernos en esta oportunidad.  Estamos comprometidas con el proyecto de una forma muy personal y nos dirigimos a ustedes como artistas, específicamente de la danza que es de donde surgieron las primeras iniciativas para crear este espacio, con el deseo de impulsar nuevas propuestas para ver, disfrutar y hacer danza.</p>
<p>En 2017, llevamos acabo la proyección de videos y de fotografías, para esta próxima edición, deseamos concretar el montaje de la exposición fotográfica, y darle el valor que las fotos merecen. Para ello necesitamos lo siguiente:</p>
</div><div><ul>
<li>Impresión de cada fotografía seleccionada.</li>
<li>Curaduría para el montaje.</li>
<li>Marcos y paspartú.</li>
<li>Material de papelería.</li>
<li>Pintura para la pared de la sala de exposiciones.</li>
<li>Bombillos.</li>
<li>Impresiones de textos para cada foto.</li>
<li>Materiales para montaje; clavos, alambre, guayas de acero, mecatillo.</li>
<li>Rotulado</li>
<li>Diseño de flyer </li>
</ul></div><div>
<p>Ya nos hemos comprometido a forjar este nuevo espacio, ahora nos toca hacerlo con la mayor dedicación para que suceda con calidad y reconociendo las verdaderas necesidades de nuestra comunidad.</p>
<p>Hay un importante número de fotógrafos venezolanos que mantienen el entusiasmo por capturar la danza que ocurre en nuestro país. A esta comunidad la hemos invitado a este espacio para compartir aquello por lo cual sigue apostando y queremos que suceda de la manera más idónea como hemos logrado que ocurra con la Categoría de Video. Necesitamos imprimir cada copia de fotografía seleccionada, queremos lograr nuestra exposición fotográfica en Cuadro por Danza.</p>
</div><div><p>Si no llegamos a lograr el 100 % de los fondos que precisamos, ajustaríamos la exposición a una menor cantidad de fotografías o nos limitaríamos a lo más esencial  para el montaje con respecto a materiales de construcción y papelería. Pero de cualquier manera, con lo que alcancemos, llevaríamos a cabo la exhibición, ya que el festival no podría reemplazar el espacio de fotografía de ninguna manera . Por otro lado, si se llegara a superar la cantidad esperada, aprovecharíamos el remanente para fondos de imprevistos que amerita la producción del evento.</p></div><div>
<p>Si no puedes contribuir con nosotras de esta manera, estamos seguras que encontrarás otras formas de ayudar, y de igual manera te lo agradeceremos.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Hi, my name is Bart Zwaard. I am a Dutch graphic designer. For almost 20 years I have worked, with great passion, as an Art &amp; Graphic Design professor at a high school in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.</p>
<p>Two years ago my wife and I made a big decision: After years of doubts we decided to follow our hearts and make our big dream reality. We found the courage to move to Italy, to start a new life with our two kids, in the country of our dreams. A big risk, giving up all our certainties, but we figured ' if your dreams do not scare you, they are not big enough.'</p>
<p>The past two years were amazing. We learned the language, adapted to the culture and made new friends. I give Art &amp; English lessons to children now and I have organised a summercamp 'Art is Fun.' We also developed ourselves big time. Finally we had the opportunity to really explore what we value in life and we discovered numerous talents within ourselves.</p>
<p>My love for art and graphic design sticked with me and made me realize: I want to work as an independent graphic designer/artist. You can help me realize that dream!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every day I draw. At the dinner table, on the train, in a park, during long, exhausting meetings. I always end up with tiny, cute 'chibi style' characters. 'These Tiny Bastardz keep on popping up!' Even when I am drawing something completely different. But I love to draw them,  to create new characters and from the love for these cute, little figures the Tiny Bastardz Art Collection was born.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope you will adore them, just as much as I do. I have designed a big set of backgrounds to support them. All in a clean, modern style. Ready to be framed. Designs to make you feel happy!</p>
<p><strong>Artwork you will enjoy every day!</strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NOW</strong> is the time to show my art collection to the world! </p>
<p>To really get my business started I need my artwork printed and displayed in counter top displays in shops. I also need a website with an integrated webshop to sell and promote my art collection. And I need funding for the marketing of the brand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>You</strong> <strong>can help me achieve these goals!</strong> </p>
<p>Support my project, buy a perk and get my artwork. Tell everybody about my project by sharing on social and by word-of-mouth. </p>
<p>Your support will help my Tiny Bastardz get out of their computer folder and into the world! :)</p>
<p><strong>Together we can make this happen!!</strong></p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I have already invested a lot of money and time in this Start Up, but to really kickstart this business I need to raise an additional €12.500,-. This amount is needed to set up a range of artprints presented in a professional way. The funds will be spend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing of the artwork </li>
<li>Website with webshop</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Counter top displays</li>
<li>Development of the brand </li>
<li>Perks</li>
<li>Shipping and packing material </li>
<li>5% fee Indiegogo and 5% payment system fee</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks: gifts to say 'thank you!' </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I have created all sorts of nice looking perks. Gifts to thank you for your support! Such as digital wallpaper backgrounds for your phone, a signed 'thank you' postcard, printed artwork in different sizes, paintings and original drawings.</p>
<p>You even have the possibility to get your own <strong>personalized artwork</strong> I will design especially for you! Just tell me your wishes and I will work my magic!</p>
<p>Just click on the different perks to check out what is included. </p>
<p>Scroll down to see all the available artwork for this campaign. Pick a size, pick the quantity, donate and the artwork will be coming your way. I will email you to get your choice of artwork and send you a professionally produced print on good quality paper in a cardboard envelop to protect it. </p>
<p>Of course I will keep you updated during the campaign and after. </p>

</div></div>","My story 
 
Hi, my name is Bart Zwaard. I am a Dutch graphic designer. For almost 20 years I have worked, with great passion, as an Art & Graphic Design professor at a high school in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.
Two years ago my wife and I made a big decision: After years of doubts we decided to follow our hearts and make our big dream reality. We found the courage to move to Italy, to start a new life with our two kids, in the country of our dreams. A big risk, giving up all our certainties, but we figured ' if your dreams do not scare you, they are not big enough.'
The past two years were amazing. We learned the language, adapted to the culture and made new friends. I give Art & English lessons to children now and I have organised a summercamp 'Art is Fun.' We also developed ourselves big time. Finally we had the opportunity to really explore what we value in life and we discovered numerous talents within ourselves.
My love for art and graphic design sticked with me and made me realize: I want to work as an independent graphic designer/artist. You can help me realize that dream!
 
Every day I draw. At the dinner table, on the train, in a park, during long, exhausting meetings. I always end up with tiny, cute 'chibi style' characters. 'These Tiny Bastardz keep on popping up!' Even when I am drawing something completely different. But I love to draw them,  to create new characters and from the love for these cute, little figures the Tiny Bastardz Art Collection was born.
 
I hope you will adore them, just as much as I do. I have designed a big set of backgrounds to support them. All in a clean, modern style. Ready to be framed. Designs to make you feel happy!
Artwork you will enjoy every day! 
 
NOW is the time to show my art collection to the world! 
To really get my business started I need my artwork printed and displayed in counter top displays in shops. I also need a website with an integrated webshop to sell and promote my art collection. And I need funding for the marketing of the brand.
 
You can help me achieve these goals! 
Support my project, buy a perk and get my artwork. Tell everybody about my project by sharing on social and by word-of-mouth. 
Your support will help my Tiny Bastardz get out of their computer folder and into the world! :)
Together we can make this happen!!


What I Need & What You Get 
 
I have already invested a lot of money and time in this Start Up, but to really kickstart this business I need to raise an additional €12.500,-. This amount is needed to set up a range of artprints presented in a professional way. The funds will be spend on:

Printing of the artwork 
Website with webshop
Marketing
Counter top displays
Development of the brand 
Perks
Shipping and packing material 
5% fee Indiegogo and 5% payment system fee

 
Perks: gifts to say 'thank you!' 
 
I have created all sorts of nice looking perks. Gifts to thank you for your support! Such as digital wallpaper backgrounds for your phone, a signed 'thank you' postcard, printed artwork in different sizes, paintings and original drawings.
You even have the possibility to get your own personalized artwork I will design especially for you! Just tell me your wishes and I will work my magic!
Just click on the different perks to check out what is included. 
Scroll down to see all the available artwork for this campaign. Pick a size, pick the quantity, donate and the artwork will be coming your way. I will email you to get your choice of artwork and send you a professionally produced print on good quality paper in a cardboard envelop to protect it. 
Of course I will keep you updated during the campaign and after.
