<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My mission has always been to make vegan food delicious AND accessible to everyone.<br/><br/>For the past four years I have been growing my vegan baking business from nothing. I started by baking unimpressive (but tasty!) cakes for my son's birthdays and now I'm happy to say that I bake birthday cakes for many other people to enjoy and I am so humbled and thankful to be a part of these celebrations and this is entirely due to customer support.<br/><br/>Now I have a *new* opportunity. <br/>Not only will I be able to keep my sweets in stock at a storefront for guests to walk in and pick up items without pre-ordering AND pick up pre-ordered custom cakes and catered orders, but we will serve light fare and coffee as well.  I am opening my very first vegan cafe!  I just need a little boost to get started and that's where you can help! <br/> <br/><br/>Here's how your contributions will help: </p>
<ul>
<li>The first <strong>3000: </strong>Pay utilities and lease for opening costs.</li>
<li>The next<strong> 5000: </strong>Purchase equipment, starting inventory and contribute to salary for any employees until business picks up momentum.</li>
<li>Any additional funding: Any structural/cosmetic or operational costs that may come as we prepare the store for opening.<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Viva! Vegan will not just be a place to pick up vegan snacks.  We have plans to host small events for community builders, participate in local eco-friendly activities, food drives, raise funds for animal sanctuaries and shelters and more as we provide food for the individual and for thought!<br/>Your help will also make a huge impact on my little business and my family.  I am a single parent from a low income household and I took a risk by building the bakery, but being able to provide people with cruelty free, plant based foods to celebrate important milestones in their lives has made every up and down well worth it. Having a storefront where I can serve the community every day will help my bakery grow! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With any business there is a risk. With any challenge there is a risk.  What if the products don't sell? What if the market doesn't want the store? What if it all falls apart? Well I believe that Delaware is ready for more vegan food. I believe that there are people in New Castle County that want more plant based options and if running my bakery for the last four years has taught me anything I've learned that we have a community of people who appreciate local businesses who are trying to make a difference.  <br/><br/>If the campaign goals are not met, I will continue to look for funding. Since I am providing a service perks will still be delivered even if the store does not open. Evangelina's Vegan Desserts will still be open. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm originally from Detroit, Michigan, and later moved to Ohio with my family. I joined the Army and studied Radiology, and have been doing it since 1985. Leaving the service in 1990, San Antonio has been our new home. I've got a passion for Medical Imaging, and helping people. I was surprised to discover that out of 40 standalone Medical Imaging centers in the city, there's wasn't a single one on the eastside. I started this journey last year, now with your help, I can give the underserved citizens on that side of town, the peace of mind of a shorter commute, and a high quality service, such as this, in their own neighborhood. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>$331,000 will be going towards equipment leases, renovation of our leased facility and operating expenses for 6 months.</li>
<li>Local donors and travelers to the city who've helped us out will receive 50% off all services for the 1st 6 months(self pay patients) as well as company t-shirts and other promotional materials</li>
<li>If for some reason we don't reach our full goal, the funds will go to basic operating expenses and a limited opening, to start seeing patients.</li>

<h3>Who are these guys?</h3>
<p>We are a young  4 people family: Tomas, the father, Judita, the mother, Erik, the son, and Davinia, the daughter-in-law...The perfect team! </p>
<p>Some more than a year ago we moved from big cities (Kaunas and Barcelona) to a village up to the north of Lithuania...that was an old dream come true.</p>
<p>Attached to the house we wanted to buy there were... 6 hectares of land we could cultivate!! So we decided  that we could perfectly turn it into a small agricultural farm.</p>
<p>For a start, we invested our capital 600 bushes of blackberries,(less than 1 hectarea) which is exactly the half that is needed to make a living of it, as we really plan. 1,200 is the minimum necessary for two families to make a humble living. And when we achieve this, we ourselves will be able to grow without asking for help.</p>

<h3>What we are asking for help?</h3>
<p>Lithuania is mainly a agriculture-based land, but young generations are emigrating to richer countries, leaving villages empty and abandoning the old and well-known country life because of lack of financiation.</p>
<p>We want to show it is possible to live and thrive working in the fields, producing natural, healthy products that this region of Lithuania mostly lacks of; that hard work has its recompense, and that living in a village is still a great option. </p>
<p>We want to live of what we grow, and stay in this place for as long as possible. And here is where we need your help!</p>
<p>The total amount we ask is  5,000 dollars,  but any contribution, even if  very small, will be so much appreciated, since very cent will be used for the same purpose.</p>

<div><div> </div></div>
<h3>Why help us?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>For small Lithuania, any push in the local, agricultural economy is always good news for its global developement. We also know we are an example for other people who are thinking about the same: to go back to their roots; to go back to farming life past generations were used to.</p>
<p>This house and its surroundings had been abandoned for two years, so it needed (and still needs!) quite a lot of repair and lots and lots of work. Tomas is a master builder, so he works in the house and we only use money to pay the materials. And, in the fields, it's just the four of us: that helps us to keep our budget, so every penny goes where it must go, til we reach our goal.</p>
<p> Your contribution to our small bussiness will not only keep our hope alive: will help us demonstrate that country life in Lithuania has still much to offer!</p>

<h3>So...where did the idea come from?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The idea of becoming farmers came not by itself. It's true, we were always amazed by the beauty of most parts of this country, but the first time we sat down together and considered farming as a real plan was when renting a small house by the lake: the owners were a couple who moved from the big city to a very small and isolated village. They worked in the fields, grew cows and bulls, and, after some years, they built small rest houses to rent next to their property, and never regreted their decision. Now they have children who want to follow their steps. </p>
<p>Now we knew that making our dreams come true was real, and as we began to plan this big change, other examples like this popped on. </p>
<p>After we moved we got to know we are already, at least, to young actively farming families in the village Pakriaunys.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>And what if…?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>""What if things do not go as well as you, guys, plan?""you may ask.</p>
<p>Certainly...We are realistic. We know that many things may happen: crops can fail; plants can get illnesess, the local market can be less reponsive than we expect...to mention just a few possible catastrophes.</p>
<p>We don't know what will happen tomorrow, but we are willing to face it, to find a way to solve it, or, if that is not possible, to get a new goal in the same direction. Together as a family, and with your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>My wallet is empty...how could I help you?</h3>

<p>You still can help!! Your word is powerful! Tell anyone who you may find this story interesting about our dream and our goals... and use the Indiegogo share tools! </p>

<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>Market Fresh Books was brought to life nearly ten years ago by Paul and Susan, a husband and wife team. Our passion is making the ownership of affordable books possible in a comfortable inviting space. To that end, Market Fresh Books has succeeded for nearly a decade. As parents and members of the Evanston/Northwestern Community, we are eager to continue to provide an affordable, active, and fun space for literary journeys that is accessible to all.  It's been a wonderful adventure and we want to keep it going.</p>
<p>Our mission has always been to get quality books into everyone's hands. Here is the gist of how we attempt this challenge, First, we maintain long hours: open 7 days 10-10. Second, our dedicated staff work perpetually to keep the bookshelves organized and alphabetized so our customers can hopefully find the used book they are looking for. Third, we use experience and a patchwork of software and technology to identify the books that are most in demand (not necessarily the newest) and prioritize those titles for our shelves. Fourth, we exclusively sell only used books and no remainders (which usually don’t meet our demand standards). Fifth, we’ve designated all our space to books. Yes, we have sacrificed areas that we could provide for reading and relaxing but choose to stock more books instead. Finally, we designed our pricing and rotation strategies to get these quality books into the community. Our approach starts by selling books by their weight. If books linger in the store for more than a few weeks, we mark them down to 50% off the weighted price. If at 50% off they still are not snatched up, we reduce them to 99cents. In the rare circumstance that a heavy book weighs in at a cost more than half the retail price, we cap our price at 50%. The bottom line to this means that if a customer buys a stack (armful) of books the average of most purchases will be 25% or more off the retail price. Often, our customers will comment as they pile up books to buy that they don’t understand how we stay in business because our prices are so low.</p>
<p>Another component of our mission is to ensure that books which have lived out their purpose or have been damaged in some fundamental way do not end up in a landfill. To accomplish that, we contract with a recycling company to have these books separated into the paper category and properly ground up and recycled to be made into new books (we hope) or other useful items. It’s been an expensive and involved way of disposing truly unwanted books but well worth it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>Running a used bookstore is generally not considered a lucrative business and booksellers are usually not motivated materialistically. A used bookstore is a razor-thin margin business and operating Market Fresh Books has gotten harder and harder. Our expenses have grown significantly since we opened our doors in 2009. For example, despite the building ownership's support and good will toward us over the years, we are in a large space with a prime location and our rent has more than doubled. Every other expense to the business has increased as well. We now find ourselves at a crossroad and need to survey the community. Is our used bookstore an asset to Evanston and an ingredient contributing to the cultural fabric that is unique to our city and even the wider community? Or, could another business or national chain step in and fill the void if we decide it's not rational for us to keep the store open. A great many customers have expressed their appreciation for what the store contributes to the neighborhood. Also, prior Evanstonians and out of towners who return to visit or find us for the first-time comment that they have no such used quality bookstores near them where they live. So, we're turning to our community to ask those that appreciate our book shop to help us continue beyond 10 years and into the future on more solid footing. We're hoping to raise $60,000 through this fundraising campaign. Any funds raised will be used to help pay off debt we have accrued operating the business and to prepare for the future. On a very personal level, your support of Market Fresh Books also signals to us and the staff that what we do is important, and that the Evanston/Northwestern community wants us to keep going.</p>
<p>We love what we do and we want to keep doing it right here in downtown Evanston. We chose Evanston not only to work, but also to live and raise our kids because Evanston is truly special. Right now, our shelves are packed, the 99cent books are overflowing and on top of that, we have an enormous backlog of really cool inventory waiting for shelf space to open.</p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Besides knowing that you are helping us to continue on our mission, if you are local, we are offering a unique “I support Market Fresh Books” mug with your donation of $25 or more. Supporters can pick up their mug the next time they visit the store. </p>
<p>When you contribute, you join with other supporters who ensure that affordable books remain accessible to everyone here in the area. You support a store that has helped fill many PTA school bookstores and inventory many classrooms. You'll help us make a difference. If you believe that Market Fresh Books has become an important part of the Evanston/Northwestern community  and want 10 years to be just the beginning, please consider supporting this campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If a giving money is not your cup of tea, there are plenty of other ways to support Market Fresh Books, consider…</p>
<p>Sharing this campaign to all your friends and groups.</p>
<p>Social network ratings are very important to us and if you could write a review on yelp, google, or any other platforms that would really help us.</p>
<p>Tell friends about the store; we always need more customers.</p>
<p>Donating your newer in demand high quality books to the store is always appreciated. We accept donations of any size and anytime the store is open – there are no restrictions.</p>
<p>And finally, stop by and shop for those books you’ve always wanted to read.</p>

The bottom line to this means that if a customer buys a stack (armful) of books the average of most purchases will be 25% or more off the retail price. Often, our customers will comment as they pile up books to buy that they don’t understand how we stay in business because our prices are so low.
Another component of our mission is to ensure that books which have lived out their purpose or have been damaged in some fundamental way do not end up in a landfill. To accomplish that, we contract with a recycling company to have these books separated into the paper category and properly ground up and recycled to be made into new books (we hope) or other useful items. It’s been an expensive and involved way of disposing truly unwanted books but well worth it.
 
What We Need 
Running a used bookstore is generally not considered a lucrative business and booksellers are usually not motivated materialistically. A used bookstore is a razor-thin margin business and operating Market Fresh Books has gotten harder and harder. Our expenses have grown significantly since we opened our doors in 2009. For example, despite the building ownership's support and good will toward us over the years, we are in a large space with a prime location and our rent has more than doubled. Every other expense to the business has increased as well. We now find ourselves at a crossroad and need to survey the community. Is our used bookstore an asset to Evanston and an ingredient contributing to the cultural fabric that is unique to our city and even the wider community? Or, could another business or national chain step in and fill the void if we decide it's not rational for us to keep the store open. A great many customers have expressed their appreciation for what the store contributes to the neighborhood. Also, prior Evanstonians and out of towners who return to visit or find us for the first-time comment that they have no such used quality bookstores near them where they live. So, we're turning to our community to ask those that appreciate our book shop to help us continue beyond 10 years and into the future on more solid footing. We're hoping to raise $60,000 through this fundraising campaign. Any funds raised will be used to help pay off debt we have accrued operating the business and to prepare for the future. On a very personal level, your support of Market Fresh Books also signals to us and the staff that what we do is important, and that the Evanston/Northwestern community wants us to keep going.
We love what we do and we want to keep doing it right here in downtown Evanston. We chose Evanston not only to work, but also to live and raise our kids because Evanston is truly special. Right now, our shelves are packed, the 99cent books are overflowing and on top of that, we have an enormous backlog of really cool inventory waiting for shelf space to open.
What You Get
Besides knowing that you are helping us to continue on our mission, if you are local, we are offering a unique “I support Market Fresh Books” mug with your donation of $25 or more. Supporters can pick up their mug the next time they visit the store. 
When you contribute, you join with other supporters who ensure that affordable books remain accessible to everyone here in the area. You support a store that has helped fill many PTA school bookstores and inventory many classrooms. You'll help us make a difference. If you believe that Market Fresh Books has become an important part of the Evanston/Northwestern community  and want 10 years to be just the beginning, please consider supporting this campaign.
Other Ways You Can Help
If a giving money is not your cup of tea, there are plenty of other ways to support Market Fresh Books, consider…
Sharing this campaign to all your friends and groups.
Social network ratings are very important to us and if you could write a review on yelp, google, or any other platforms that would really help us.
Tell friends about the store; we always need more customers.
Donating your newer in demand high quality books to the store is always appreciated. We accept donations of any size and anytime the store is open – there are no restrictions.
And finally, stop by and shop for those books you’ve always wanted to read.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello. My name is Macanon Dhein. I am a High Pressure Steam licensed pipefitter/welder. I have been in the welding field for the past 12 years, and have been in some form of construction or manufacturing field since high school. I have always loved learning about and operating tools and equipment. My partner is Misty Bolstad, a life long hobbyist, immeasurably creative, and current owner/operator of Olde Haven Arts and Etching.</p>
<p>We want to offer everyone in the St. Cloud, MN metro area the opportunity to explore their creative side, with equipment they either could never afford or wouldn't have space for, and give kids a place to productively spend their time, something sadly lacking in this area, and learn things that will have a lasting impact on what they want to do with their lives.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish all of this, we need your help to get this project off the ground. You will be vital to achieving positive change in people's lives.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are setting our goal at $100,000.  We settled on this goal, because it will allow us to acquire an adequate sized space, a decent selection of equipment to get started, and cover initial operating costs. Of course, the more we raise, the better our opening will be...</p>
<p>Our perks package will offer a variety of seriously discounted memberships, as well as vouchers for free workshops that may interest you in the future. Because none of these will expire, you can feel free to wait to redeem your perks until we offer equipment or classes that strikes your fancy.</p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our goal, we will reassess our plans based on how short we fall. Everything from scaling down our equipment to meet our opening deadline, to postponing opening until we can raise enough to have a decent opening.  Because we feel this undertaking to be of significant importance for the people it will benefit, we will not stop working to make this a reality.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you are unable to contribute financially, you can help greatly by sharing this with everyone you know. Please, get the word out about our campaign and about our project, so we can succeed at helping others succeed!</p>

<p>• Educate our local people
and organizations about the possible threat (any age), the symptoms  of a cardiac arrest/ heart attack and what
they should do during such medical emergencies. 
Alert them to be prepared, to know who to call, <br/>
where to take the ailing person, how to help them while waiting for emergency
assistance.  During emergencies these
simple steps often become impossible under extreme stress if one is  not

<p> • Make available to local
people and organizations certified training for CPR and the use of AEDs.  Distribute information that describes what
CPR is, what the class entails, and the importance of being certified and ready
to assist loved ones, friends, neighbors  and possibly donate their time to the community. 
It is not clearly known by most locals in our communities what an AED is or how it works and that the CPR process may be

</div></div>","The problem:

Each year around 5,000 people die from heart attacks in Costa Rica. Most of those lives are lost by the absence of an appropriate response in the initial minutes of the emergency...


The solutions we work for:

•  Provide defibrillators
“AEDs” and an action & education plan to our communities
that don’t have access to or don’t have adequate emergency medical equipment.
• Educate our local people
and organizations about the possible threat (any age), the symptoms  of a cardiac arrest/ heart attack and what
they should do during such medical emergencies. 
Alert them to be prepared, to know who to call, 
where to take the ailing person, how to help them while waiting for emergency
assistance.  During emergencies these
simple steps often become impossible under extreme stress if one is  not
prepared with a plan of action. 






 • Make available to local
people and organizations certified training for CPR and the use of AEDs.  Distribute information that describes what
CPR is, what the class entails, and the importance of being certified and ready
to assist loved ones, friends, neighbors  and possibly donate their time to the community. 
It is not clearly known by most locals in our communities what an AED is or how it works and that the CPR process may be
necessary to initiate before an AED will activate.

• Develop Emergency applications for SMART phones.  A member of our community is a computer specialist/engineer.  He and his associate are volunteering their time to develop applications.  The prime application will show “Emergencies” and then layered below will be the following:  1) Medical Emergency (general), 2) Heart Attack, 3) Car crash, 4) Crime being committed.  We will need to contract with a call center and then have an administrator available to enter the phone owners’ emergency data to the call center.   This could be the first technologically advanced emergency phone system made available in Central America.  According to our research many local Costa Ricans and foreign residents have Smart Phones.  Eventually we will look into having the phone company offer big discounts for Costa Ricans unable to afford the market price of the phone. 


• Develop public relation programs to promote preventive measures relating to cardiac medical issues and overall emergency preparedness. Having the emergency phone applications available will most certainly make people aware of how vulnerable they are without having emergency plans in place for their families and motivate them to sign up for the applications.


• Improving survival opportunities on medical emergencies , as well as providing education and guidance on emergency preparedness in rural communities of Costa Rica.

The intention of this social greeting is good, met with acceptance and

 An ambulance would respond
with only a driver, no AED, no oxygen and no trained medical emergency

<p><span>Hi there! I’m Juana, I had a difficult time finding a sense of community and locating the gay/alternative crowd where I could make friends. And I couldn't easily locate and support businesses that were LGBT owned. The more people I spoke with, the more I realized this is a very common issue. </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<br/>
<p><span>I've been an internet marketer for a decade and now I'm using my online skill-set to help unite the LGBT business world with the LGBT consumer (or as it's now known Queersumer) market.  LGBT members want to support their community and LGBT friendly businesses, but it’s never been easy to locate them.</span></p>

<p><span>We have a one-stop shop directory where the businesses are easy to find, community is easy to find, it’s easy to make friends and even find romance.  We are using the internet to unite community on a local level.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><b>We need your help with things like</b></p>·Web Design and a Development Team ·Audio and Video Equipment ·Marketing ·Software ·Studio Work <br/>·Event Coordinators ·Promotional Materials<br/><br/><p>We can put so much more functionality into what we already have. In order to stay on the cutting edge online, we will use these tools and the most up to date processes for both the business owners and Queersumers.</p>
<p>It’s important to get the word out because we want to reach the people sitting at home alone because they may not have found community.  Putting systems into place will allow us to have a sound structure. We will be able to make user friendly experiences for everyone and to make this whole online world less complicated to figure out and really simple for the average person.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><b>The

Uniting the Queersumer Market


follow us on:  Facebook.com/IShopLGBT

Hi there! I’m Juana, I had a difficult time finding a sense of community and locating the gay/alternative crowd where I could make friends. And I couldn't easily locate and support businesses that were LGBT owned. The more people I spoke with, the more I realized this is a very common issue. 


I've been an internet marketer for a decade and now I'm using my online skill-set to help unite the LGBT business world with the LGBT consumer (or as it's now known Queersumer) market.  LGBT members want to support their community and LGBT friendly businesses, but it’s never been easy to locate them.

This Is Where I SHOP LGBT Comes In


We have a one-stop shop directory where the businesses are easy to find, community is easy to find, it’s easy to make friends and even find romance.  We are using the internet to unite community on a local level.

We need your help with things like·Web Design and a Development Team ·Audio and Video Equipment ·Marketing ·Software ·Studio Work ·Event Coordinators ·Promotional MaterialsWe can put so much more functionality into what we already have. In order to stay on the cutting edge online, we will use these tools and the most up to date processes for both the business owners and Queersumers.
It’s important to get the word out because we want to reach the people sitting at home alone because they may not have found community.  Putting systems into place will allow us to have a sound structure. We will be able to make user friendly experiences for everyone and to make this whole online world less complicated to figure out and really simple for the average person.

The
summer months will give us the opportunity to implement systems to grow and put the plan into motion, both online and in the real world. In the fall we hope to expand our movement to specific markets and target more areas.

Our subscription service offers chef-prepared purees made from certified organic ingredients that are sourced almost entirely within 50 miles of our home base in Cleveland, Ohio. Every week, you'll receive delicious purees made with ingredients you know and love from your local farmers market -- rainbow carrots, golden beets, kohlrabi and rutabaga -- which simply aren't available in the baby food aisle. </p>
<p>And because our foods are frozen, we've preserved many of the nutrients that are lost in the high-heat processing required for traditional shelf-stable jars and pouches, including B vitamins and folate essential for infant growth and development. Just thaw and go: Our low-waste, recyclable packaging is ready the next day when thawed in the fridge or in just a few minutes when submerged in simmering water.</p>

<h3>You Put the 'Go' in 'Goal'</h3> <p>We can't make Rutababy a reality without you, so here's where we want to head and how you can help make it happen:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>We've already spent about $2,000 on things like early-round batch testing, business classes, legal fees, website tools, etc.</li>
<li>Next we want about $3,000 to perfect our recipes and packaging, from getting the taste and texture perfect to figuring out how many pounds of carrots we need for a standard batch to seeing how our pouches perform once they're sealed and delivered. That will help us set the right selling price.</li>
<li>After that we need about $3,000 to send our recipes to the lab, get our organic certification and establish accounts payable with the farms and providers that will supply our foods and vital business services.</li>
<li>Then we require nearly $8,000 to get started with a two-month trial round, where we will operate our business with a limited number of customers who will receive a discount in exchange for detailed feedback on the process and food.</li>
<li>Finally, we'll get started in September with $4,000 for marketing, inventory, a few extra hands in the kitchen, some cooking equipment that will let us make larger batches and a delivery service to bring it all to you.</li>
</ul>
<div>In exchange, we're offering incentives that will outfit the cutest baby you know, rock your farm-to-baby support on your car bumper or set you up for delivery in the fall at a discounted price.</div>
<div>If we don't reach our overall goal, there are a few things we can do to get started with a leaner budget, including reducing the variety of flavors on offer, eliminating some equipment purchases in favor of beg/borrow/pleading, simplifying our packaging, doing the labor ourselves when we get home from work and forgoing nutritional labeling (which are required for sales at grocery stores).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Mother's Little Helper</h3> <p>We know it's difficult just to remember to shower in the morning. It's challenging to eat right, to support local farmers and to prevent food waste. By supporting Rutababy, you're helping (yourself or others) access the benefits of homemade foods in a more convenient and efficient way than going it alone. </p>
<p>Laura already knows how to manage a professional kitchen, how to find quality vendors, and how to manage perishable inventory. But she can't fund this project alone. She tried.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>May the Road Rise to Meet You</h3> <p>It's a long road ahead. Even with a successful campaign, Rutababy faces challenges. We're confident we've got the skills and drive to meet them head-on, but we want you to know we've thought about these potential speed bumps:</p> <ul> <li>We're short on time: If you're a potential customer, this one doesn't require explanation, but Laura still has to work full time as a food writer and business magazine editor and needs to hire kitchen help to manage production. </li>
<li>It's more complicated than a Craigslist ad: Good help is hard to find. Luckily, Laura's extensive network and her experience as a head chef and manager will help mitigate this problem.</li> <li>See the value: For Rutababy to be successful, our customers have to see the value in our product and service. We're confident that the market research we've done so far supports our idea, but you never know for sure until you try.</li>
<li>Spreading the word: A fantastic product and well-run business is no good if no one knows about it. Laura's background in publishing and her extensive network is a tremendous asset in helping get the word out, but we've also included marketing expenses into our business plan for additional help in this department.</li> </ul>

</div></div>","Ain't Nobody Got Time for That As if life isn't hectic enough between work, meetings, household chores and basic hygiene, you've decided to add a baby into the mix. 
We understand you want the best for your baby. But let's be realistic: Not everyone has the time, energy, skill, patience or desire to spend precious cuddle time in the kitchen making locally grown, organic, homemade baby food. 
So let's say these things are really important to you in a baby food (and we'd certainly agree):


Organic
Local
Nutrition
Convenience
Variety

Rutababy offers a way to round out your baby's diet without cutting corners. Our subscription service offers chef-prepared purees made from certified organic ingredients that are sourced almost entirely within 50 miles of our home base in Cleveland, Ohio. Every week, you'll receive delicious purees made with ingredients you know and love from your local farmers market -- rainbow carrots, golden beets, kohlrabi and rutabaga -- which simply aren't available in the baby food aisle. 
And because our foods are frozen, we've preserved many of the nutrients that are lost in the high-heat processing required for traditional shelf-stable jars and pouches, including B vitamins and folate essential for infant growth and development. Just thaw and go: Our low-waste, recyclable packaging is ready the next day when thawed in the fridge or in just a few minutes when submerged in simmering water.


Why Local?

Pediatricians agree that babies actually begin to develop taste preferences in utero. But while Cleveland is increasingly recognized at the top of the list for best dining destinations in the U.S., we're becoming foodies too late in life. 
The earlier children begin eating healthy, wholesome ingredients, the more likely they are to prefer them later in life, and good nutrition can have a profound effect on your child's physical and mental growth. Getting children to eat their fruits and vegetables doesn't have to be a struggle -- if you start early with high-quality ingredients grown with care and harvested at the right time. You love farmers markets and CSAs, so why wouldn't your kids?
Organic is a good start that reduces the icky effects of large-scale agriculture like polluted water runoff. But buying locally means growers can select for taste and nutrition instead of how well the produce holds up over long-distance shipping routes. It also reduces fossil fuel consumption and supports biodiversity for a healthier planet.



By using the best of what's available in each season, we can create a new generation of healthy eaters who know that fresh ingredients aren't just better for us, they also taste better. And we can strengthen communities along the way by supporting the farmers who've believed in local foods all along.

<p>We are Crystal and Trishay, a passionate couple of people looking to
do some good in the community. We love drinking good coffee and creating
gorgeous meals. Food shouldn’t be about sustenance. It is at the very heart of
enjoying life! </p>
<p>We also very strongly believe in the equality of all. We
hope to open a loving space where anyone and everyone will feel comfortable and
accepted. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>A little bit about
our vision:</b></p>
<p>We want to create a beautiful café and retail space in the
heart of Ashwood. Our business will be called From the Art. </p>
<p>We will serve up specialty organic tea and coffee from a
sustainable fair trade source – no nasties included! Our coffee supplier,
STREAT, works to end youth homelessness by training disadvantaged young people
in the hospitality industry, so every cup provides hope!</p>
<p>Our hand-crafted items will support disadvantaged
communities from around the world to be economically independent. We will use the
items and the space to promote multiculturalism, acceptance and love for all.</p>
<p>Our café will serve as a safe, comfortable space for people
to leisurely spend time. A stack of books will offer thought-provoking reading
material for those seeking to broaden horizons. </p>
<p>Our café will create jobs for asylum seekers/refugees, a people
most desperately in need of fulfilling work. We will provide employment
training and friendship to a few people in need of open arms. We will also proudly act as an information
point for anyone in need. </p>
<p>We will hand-create our healthy and delicious dishes, using local ingredients, with no nasties or preservatives included. We will make every effort to cater
to most dietary needs (no need to desperately search for a yummy
vegetarian/vegan/gluten free option!). </p>
<p>The café fit-out will be created with gorgeous and weathered
recycled materials, recovered from all around Melbourne.</p>
<p>The business will use recycled compostable packaging and
office materials where possible. </p>

<p><i>The <a href=""http://www.asrc.org.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Asylum Seeker Resource Centre</a> </i>describes this population as individuals who each:</p>
<p>“Has had to leave their country because it is too dangerous
to stay there;</p>
<p>Who is in danger in their country because they are being
seriously harmed or at risk of serious harm because of either their political
opinion, religion, race, nationality or social group; and</p>
<p>Whose government can’t or won’t protect them from that
serious harm.”</p>
<p>They have come here hoping for something we all need at some
point or another – a fair go! We hope to give a few good people a stable income
in a loving and caring environment. We would also love to see our Ashwood
community interact with them and hopefully sow the seeds for acceptance in the
larger Melbourne community.</p>

<p>Our coffee beans will be supplied through <a href=""https://www.streat.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">STREAT</a>, a

them into jobs and off of the streets.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431076765/qave4ljg8arhig4qoaqe.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 597.247311827957px; height: 131px;""/></p><p><br/></p>

While international aid may be important, <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123758895999200083"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">multiple studies</a> have shown that aid is complex and oftentimes only serves to keep people in poverty. However, supporting them in continuing their local craft
builds confidence and economic independence. We will sell items where the
people have been paid fairly for their work, just as you would hope for your
own family members.</p><p>For example, we have sourced some jewellery pieces from
Cambodia made by local artisans. They skilfully melt used bomb shells from

<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>A little bit about
our finances:</b></p>
<p>As you may have figured out by now, good things don’t come
cheap! </p>
<p>We will need to balance our humanitarian efforts with running costs. We will inevitably pay a higher rate for items where the
artisans were paid fairly.  We will also
run costs to train employees as we teach them the tricks of the trade. </p>
<p>We have rented out a space in Ashwood (located in the Eastern suburbs of Melbourne), and we are tirelessly working to get things ready. We've sinked our savings into this project! But to really get us fully up and running, we need a little bit of help from
the community. </p>
<p>In the spirit of transparency, here is a quick glance at
some of our start-up costs:</p>
<p>Coffee Machine and coffee bean grinders: $6,000</p>
<p>Café kitchen fit-out: $4,730</p>
<p>Recycled timber retail fit-out: $2,300</p>
<p>Plumbing work: $2,365</p>
<p>Electrical wiring work: $925</p>
<p>This does not even include the cost of council permits, new
employees, food/coffee/tea supplies and retail items! In sum, we could use all
the help you can spare! We will use every cent of your donations to support our
goal to open a café from the heart. </p>
<p>We understand that not everyone is able to donate
financially. But please help us spread the word so it reaches someone who can. </p>
<p>We care about the world around us. And we know you do too.
Please be a part in helping us to create something beautiful!</p>
<p>Can’t wait to see you at our café in Ashwood!</p>

created pieces from something designed to destroy. Please help us support them!                                   
A little bit about
our finances:
As you may have figured out by now, good things don’t come
cheap! 
We will need to balance our humanitarian efforts with running costs. We will inevitably pay a higher rate for items where the
artisans were paid fairly.  We will also
run costs to train employees as we teach them the tricks of the trade. 
We have rented out a space in Ashwood (located in the Eastern suburbs of Melbourne), and we are tirelessly working to get things ready. We've sinked our savings into this project! But to really get us fully up and running, we need a little bit of help from
the community. 
In the spirit of transparency, here is a quick glance at
some of our start-up costs:
Coffee Machine and coffee bean grinders: $6,000
Café kitchen fit-out: $4,730
Recycled timber retail fit-out: $2,300
Plumbing work: $2,365
Electrical wiring work: $925
This does not even include the cost of council permits, new
employees, food/coffee/tea supplies and retail items! In sum, we could use all
the help you can spare! We will use every cent of your donations to support our
goal to open a café from the heart. 
We understand that not everyone is able to donate
financially. But please help us spread the word so it reaches someone who can. 
We care about the world around us. And we know you do too.
Please be a part in helping us to create something beautiful!
Can’t wait to see you at our café in Ashwood!
From our heart to yours,

<h2>How Funding This Campaign Will Help You and Others Around the World</h2>
<div>
<p>Whether you're already a WordPress expert, or brand new to WordPress, this project will help you to build, grow, and enhance your WordPress-powered business.</p>
<p>There are already some great sources for learning WordPress including <a href=""http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Lessons"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WordPress Lessons</a>, <a href=""http://www.wpbeginner.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WPBeginner</a>, <a href=""http://wptavern.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WP Tavern</a>, <a href=""https://poststatus.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Post Status</a>, <a href=""https://pippinsplugins.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pippin's Plugins</a>, <a href=""http://bobwp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BobWP</a>, <a href=""http://chrislema.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chris Lema</a>, <a href=""http://www.wpmayor.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WP Mayor</a>, <a href=""https://www.wp101.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WP101</a>, and many others.</p>
<p>But basic usage, industry news, and develepor tutorials are not the focus of this site.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>How WP Pro Business is Different</h3>
<p>Other sites focus more on how to use the software itself, WordPress news, or advanced coding for those developing themes or plugins and not how to utilize WordPress to build and market your offline or online business.</p>
<p>WP Pro Business will focus exclusively on teaching people just like you how to enhance and market their businesses utilizing various combinations of WordPress plugins and related services.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<h3>WordPress and Business Beginners</h3>
<div>WP Pro Business will be <b>a free resource to educate and guide business owners</b> to the plugins, services and marketing methods with proven results in order to fast track their site builds and revenue growth.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Freelance Designers and Developers</h3>
<div>Time is of the essence when you're a freelancer and searching for the right solution to implement in your WordPress projects.
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Breaking from your project to research answers is unpaid time and often takes some trial and error to ensure you have the right tool (or plugin) to accomplish what your client needs.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Let me do the testing for you by way of video and written tutorials that are concise, to the point, and not filled with fluff. I'll save you time in finding the right plugin and other tools so you can take on more clients. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Agencies</h3>
<div>Your agency team does more than custom site development and you should have a free resource for saving time. You should also have a trusted source that you can point clients to, for those who want to learn more about growing the business you helped them to create.
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Each tutorial will show the specific benefit to their business. Visitors who don't want to (or don't know how) to implement the content of the tutorial will be encouraged to request it from their preferred agency contact.</div>

<h4>Why This Site Needs a Reboot</h4>
<div>Publishing high quality and regularly updated content for any website is a full time job. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Three years ago I was trying to grow and scale this site into a self-supporting business while still working full time as a Web Development and Internet Marketing Manager for a large corporation, but that process came with an inherent weak point: there are only 24 hours in a day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I made the choice to focus on my corporate day job and this site quickly suffered as I no longer had the time to create the kind of tutorial content it deserved.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I loved this position as it allowed me to work with the same software I love, every day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h4>Fast Forward Four Years</h4>
<div>This company relocated its local office and I had the option to pursue the same career in their other locations (a different State or a different Country).</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">But because our first son was due to be born in less than a month, I chose to stay in my location and with the help of our savings, cashing out my 401k, and family, started a <a href=""http://fooplugins.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">premium WordPress plugin business</a> with a partner that has maintained a solid market share for the past three years.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>I was able to build that company into a strong self-sustaining digital business and have learned much along the way, and it's still growing today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><i>But now it's time to get back to my true passion: Teaching and creating content that people can utilize immediately to create, grow, and scale their own independent businesses powered by WordPress. <b>Just like I've done</b>.</i></div>

<div>By funding the reboot and continuation of this site you will be directly impacting the lives of countless others who find, consume, and benefit from my tutorials.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I am not the first, nor will I be the last to create WordPress-specific tutorial sites, but I believe I have something that other sites don't:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><i>A true passion for helping others achieve their goal of creating an independent and self-sustaining business powered by WordPress.</i></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Whether you utilize WordPress as a simple brochure type site for your offline business or are actively creating and selling digital products, I have the experience and passion to help you navigate through the tens of thousands of free and premium products and services that will impact your business.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I love learning and experimenting and showing you the results in order to save you time and frustration.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>No project comes without hurdles, whether anticipated or unseen. The one challenge that has plagued me in the past few years has been those pesky and limited 24 hours.</div>

I'm an active member of the WordPress community and have a passion for teaching and showing others how to utilize WordPress to achieve their independent business goals.

How Funding This Campaign Will Help You and Others Around the World

Whether you're already a WordPress expert, or brand new to WordPress, this project will help you to build, grow, and enhance your WordPress-powered business.
There are already some great sources for learning WordPress including WordPress Lessons, WPBeginner, WP Tavern, Post Status, Pippin's Plugins, BobWP, Chris Lema, WP Mayor, WP101, and many others.
But basic usage, industry news, and develepor tutorials are not the focus of this site.
How WP Pro Business is Different
Other sites focus more on how to use the software itself, WordPress news, or advanced coding for those developing themes or plugins and not how to utilize WordPress to build and market your offline or online business.
WP Pro Business will focus exclusively on teaching people just like you how to enhance and market their businesses utilizing various combinations of WordPress plugins and related services.


WordPress and Business Beginners
WP Pro Business will be a free resource to educate and guide business owners to the plugins, services and marketing methods with proven results in order to fast track their site builds and revenue growth.


Freelance Designers and Developers
Time is of the essence when you're a freelancer and searching for the right solution to implement in your WordPress projects.


Breaking from your project to research answers is unpaid time and often takes some trial and error to ensure you have the right tool (or plugin) to accomplish what your client needs.

Let me do the testing for you by way of video and written tutorials that are concise, to the point, and not filled with fluff. I'll save you time in finding the right plugin and other tools so you can take on more clients. 

Agencies
Your agency team does more than custom site development and you should have a free resource for saving time. You should also have a trusted source that you can point clients to, for those who want to learn more about growing the business you helped them to create.


Each tutorial will show the specific benefit to their business. Visitors who don't want to (or don't know how) to implement the content of the tutorial will be encouraged to request it from their preferred agency contact.

See What Others Have to Say
Adam is not just incredibly generous with sharing his experience growing WordPress businesses, but he's great at it. 
When he writes and speaks, he makes it clear how you can apply what he's learned to your own business. 
I look forward to reading more of what he has to offer through a re-booted WP Pro Business.
Josh Pollock - CalderaWP


Adam is a fountain of WordPress and small business knowledge. He's talked me through more than a few challenges. 
If you can get 30 minutes of his time, you won't be disappointed.

Ben Fox - SIDEKICK.pro



Before I met with Adam I tried building my business website with WordPress on my own. In such an overloaded and confusing world of information, Adam simplified the process of building a website focused on getting customers through my door. 
His lessons were clear, concise and easy to understand for someone who wanted a business website that not only focuses today's immediate requirements but also with an eye toward the future.  
Nicole Johnson - Above the Neck Salon


Adam's business insights and generosity make him a rare and unique breed in the WordPress world. 
Much of what I do on a day to day basis since is directly influenced by things I learned from Adam. 
Some folks I take with a grain of salt -- Adam's advice I take with a steak and a beer. It's that good.

Matt Cromwell - WordPress Developer and Entrepreneur


I’d never used EDD before this course, but have some experience with other eCommerce plugins. The lessons were easy to follow and covered required settings and usage details to configure the plugin for built-in test and PayPal Standard gateways. 
For many sites, that’s all that’s needed, particularly with the reporting features available out of the box. I can see using this plugin for myself and for authors who don’t need a full-blown eCommerce solution. 
Nice course with just the right amount of detail to complete quickly and put to use!

Why This Site Needs a Reboot
Publishing high quality and regularly updated content for any website is a full time job. 

Three years ago I was trying to grow and scale this site into a self-supporting business while still working full time as a Web Development and Internet Marketing Manager for a large corporation, but that process came with an inherent weak point: there are only 24 hours in a day.

I made the choice to focus on my corporate day job and this site quickly suffered as I no longer had the time to create the kind of tutorial content it deserved.

I loved this position as it allowed me to work with the same software I love, every day.

Fast Forward Four Years
This company relocated its local office and I had the option to pursue the same career in their other locations (a different State or a different Country).

But because our first son was due to be born in less than a month, I chose to stay in my location and with the help of our savings, cashing out my 401k, and family, started a premium WordPress plugin business with a partner that has maintained a solid market share for the past three years.

I was able to build that company into a strong self-sustaining digital business and have learned much along the way, and it's still growing today.

But now it's time to get back to my true passion: Teaching and creating content that people can utilize immediately to create, grow, and scale their own independent businesses powered by WordPress. Just like I've done.

By funding the reboot and continuation of this site you will be directly impacting the lives of countless others who find, consume, and benefit from my tutorials.

I am not the first, nor will I be the last to create WordPress-specific tutorial sites, but I believe I have something that other sites don't:

A true passion for helping others achieve their goal of creating an independent and self-sustaining business powered by WordPress.

Whether you utilize WordPress as a simple brochure type site for your offline business or are actively creating and selling digital products, I have the experience and passion to help you navigate through the tens of thousands of free and premium products and services that will impact your business.

I love learning and experimenting and showing you the results in order to save you time and frustration.
    Risks & Challenges
No project comes without hurdles, whether anticipated or unseen. The one challenge that has plagued me in the past few years has been those pesky and limited 24 hours.

I've done quite a bit of soul searching, self-improvement and planning to ensure that the schedule I've outlined above is attainable and to be frank, this campaign plays a critical role in helping me stick to my planned schedule.

The funding from this campaign will allow me to focus 100% on growing this site and its content to where I've always envisioned it could be. The ""trick"" was always finding a way to work on it full time while still supporting myself and my family.

Your contribution will directly impact the lives and futures of countless others who are learning as I did years ago about what's possible with the WordPress software.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you're not in a position to help fund this campaign but you still believe that what I'm trying to do will make a difference, there is still one super simple way to lend a hand.  Copy the url to this site and include it in your blog posts. Even easier, just use the Indiegogo share tools to help spread the word! (Pro Tip: use hashtag #wppoweredbusiness)

<p>In the military, we
come together from all walks of life to form a band of brothers to defend
freedom; to proudly serve our families, our branch of service, and ultimately
our country and all Americans.  This type
of drive and motivation comes from within. It is a sort of 'calling.’</p>
<p>Hello, my name is John
White. I am the CEO and an owner
of XPC Force Protection. XPC Force Protection, or “XPC” for short, is a small
business based in New Braunfels, Texas, which is located between San
Antonio and Austin.</p>
<p>Contributions we
receive will directly provide much needed benefits to veterans. Too often,
veterans find unnecessary obstacles when they decide to leave active duty. XPC
wants to help these heroes with a much improved transition into the civilian
world. Your contributions will aid in providing access to employment and training for these highly skilled and intelligent
people. They have made sacrifices for this country. Now, XPC plans to give back
to them.</p>
<p>Now that each of us
have completed our tours of duty, we still crave the higher calling of serving
others. We want to give back to our local communities, our country, and even
continue serving American interests overseas.</p>
<p>We want to provide a
familiar environment for our veterans. Transitioning from military service to a
civilian lifestyle can sometimes be difficult. Our country has come a long way since
our forefathers have returned home from the battlefield and face uncertainty.
However, there is still work to be done.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>First, we need meet
the financial burden that comes with starting a new business.</p>
<p>Second, we need to
build a marketing campaign that can reach global business leaders that may be
able to utilize our services.</p>
<p>Third, we need work.
We are highly trained individuals education and experienced by Uncle Sam. We
have a sense of achievement and dedication that rivals none. However, our
message and services need to reach those individuals in positions to hiring us.
We can hold concealed handgun license (CHL) classes locally or we can provide
asset security for large conglomerates (oil pipelines, electrical substations, sea-going
shipping container vessels, etc.). We can greatly reduce the risk of piracy on
the high seas or provide a vigilant watch over your production compound. We are
highly trained and professional veterans ready to work.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Nearly all of our
current employees are combat veterans from the Marine Corps, Navy, Army, Air Force, and some of us have even retired. Our internal programs will provide
these veterans with necessary skills to return to, and maintain, a productive
and sustained lifestyle outside of the military. This is where we need your
help. All donations raised will help us provide meaningful employment and
transition resources to those who have returned home to face uncertainty. We
will provide meaningful training, both in the classroom, as well as on-the-job
training, even counseling services and support teams. We want to provide
meaningful employment for as many veterans as possible. Providing sustainable
employment means providing meaningful jobs. As many of you already know, one
challenge of providing meaningful jobs requires a significant budget to
advertise our services.</p>
<p>Your contributions
will directly help to put veterans to work in the short-term, and help them
plan for new careers in the long-term.</p>
<p>XPC has coined the
phrase: “Being a victim is only a state of mind.” This means you are only a
victim until you repel that fear of being a victim. We want all of our clients
to feel safe and secure whether it’s at work, at home, or at play. We have a
list of consultation services we offer as well as various training services.
Our veterans have years of expertise within their respective job fields and
look forward to giving back to the community we once protected while in
uniform. We want to continue to protect our communities not that we are out of
our uniforms. We have partnered with other organizations to offer even greater
amenities to our clients.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We know there are risks along the way. We also know that we will
leave no one behind. Our commitment to service, to each other, and to you will
continue to inspire us and inspire XPC. To everyone still deployed, keep your head
down and come home safe. We will be here for you. For everyone else, come on
this journey with us. We would love to have you.</p>
<p>We need funds to begin the process of helping veterans, and our
company, to grow. In the long run, our company will provide more jobs, both
domestically as well as globally, to more veterans.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

too large. If you cannot donate, please consider helping us spread the word
about our committed and dedication veterans who comprise our company. You can

<h3>What is Tre Truck?</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>Tre Truck is the world's first mobile skate shop.  Founded in 2011, we have spent the last 5 years servicing the New York City skate community. Whether it's gear, snacks, or just a helping hand, we are there when skaters need us.  What makes us different from other skate-shops is that Tre Truck isn't bound by any single location.  We move from park to park and spot to spot, wherever people are shredding.  This means that we are right there when things go wrong to fix your setup. Whether its a popped bearing or a broken board we are there to help!  We also try to give back to the community by putting on events and competitions.</p>
<p>We also want to help bring the style of New York street skating around the world.  Like a skateboard Johnny Appleseed, planting little Big Apples from coast to coast.</p>
<p>Check out these videos to see what a day cruising with the Tre Truck is like!</p>

<div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help </h3>
<p>Tre Truck is getting ready to expand its operations.</p>
<p>We are planning on expanding our services in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiring 2 full time employees to keep Tre Truck running 7 days a week.</li>
<li>Hosting 5 events and competitions for the local skate community.</li>
<li>Traveling to 3 larger skate events nationwide.</li>
<li>Working with New York City Department of Parks and Recreation to offer skate lessons for various skill levels.</li>
<li>Expanding our presence with a Tre Truck in California</li>
</ul>
<div>We also need capital to keep the Tre Truck going day-to-day.  These obligations include:<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Truck maintenance</li>
<li>Parking/Gas</li>
<li>Permits and licenses</li>
<li>Inventory management</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Skate shops have always been at the core of the skateboarding community.  Since the days of clay wheels, kids have gone to their local skate shop not only to buy gear, but to find mentorship from more experienced skaters.  The Tre Truck provides that same skate shop atmosphere right by the skatepark.  This means that skaters don't have to go as far to meet a supportive network of people that will help them learn, grow, and have fun.</p>
<p>Skate shops are also a hub of creativity.  Their role as a place for skaters to come together means that people are always bouncing ideas and challenging one another to grow their skills.  The Tre Truck will help continue this tradition and strengthen it by bringing the shop and the street closer together.  We are also there to help settle conflicts and provide a safe space and friendly atmosphere.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Beyond the normal risks of a brick and mortar retail business. There are two primary obstacles that come with running a mobile skate shop.  These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unexpected truck breakdowns</li>
<li>Unpredictable weather/Seasonal Business</li>
</ul>
<div>While breakdowns are inevitable, part of our plan is to expand our presence to California, so that we can keep active year-round.  Our first step in expanding will be taking the Tre Truck on a cross-country tour to California with our friends, The Gnarmads.  We will make many stops on our way and finally settle on the west coast for the winter.  Once there, we will begin working the groundwork for a TreTruck in California.  For more details, check out this map of our tour:<br/><br/><p></p>

</div></div>","What is Tre Truck?



Tre Truck is the world's first mobile skate shop.  Founded in 2011, we have spent the last 5 years servicing the New York City skate community. Whether it's gear, snacks, or just a helping hand, we are there when skaters need us.  What makes us different from other skate-shops is that Tre Truck isn't bound by any single location.  We move from park to park and spot to spot, wherever people are shredding.  This means that we are right there when things go wrong to fix your setup. Whether its a popped bearing or a broken board we are there to help!  We also try to give back to the community by putting on events and competitions.
We also want to help bring the style of New York street skating around the world.  Like a skateboard Johnny Appleseed, planting little Big Apples from coast to coast.
Check out these videos to see what a day cruising with the Tre Truck is like!






You can also have a look at this piece the Berrics produced about the Tre Truck.

Why We Need Your Help 
Tre Truck is getting ready to expand its operations.
We are planning on expanding our services in the following ways:

Hiring 2 full time employees to keep Tre Truck running 7 days a week.
Hosting 5 events and competitions for the local skate community.
Traveling to 3 larger skate events nationwide.
Working with New York City Department of Parks and Recreation to offer skate lessons for various skill levels.
Expanding our presence with a Tre Truck in California

We also need capital to keep the Tre Truck going day-to-day.  These obligations include:


Truck maintenance
Parking/Gas
Permits and licenses
Inventory management




The Impact
Skate shops have always been at the core of the skateboarding community.  Since the days of clay wheels, kids have gone to their local skate shop not only to buy gear, but to find mentorship from more experienced skaters.  The Tre Truck provides that same skate shop atmosphere right by the skatepark.  This means that skaters don't have to go as far to meet a supportive network of people that will help them learn, grow, and have fun.
Skate shops are also a hub of creativity.  Their role as a place for skaters to come together means that people are always bouncing ideas and challenging one another to grow their skills.  The Tre Truck will help continue this tradition and strengthen it by bringing the shop and the street closer together.  We are also there to help settle conflicts and provide a safe space and friendly atmosphere.

Risks & Challenges
Beyond the normal risks of a brick and mortar retail business. There are two primary obstacles that come with running a mobile skate shop.  These include:

Unexpected truck breakdowns
Unpredictable weather/Seasonal Business

While breakdowns are inevitable, part of our plan is to expand our presence to California, so that we can keep active year-round.  Our first step in expanding will be taking the Tre Truck on a cross-country tour to California with our friends, The Gnarmads.  We will make many stops on our way and finally settle on the west coast for the winter.  Once there, we will begin working the groundwork for a TreTruck in California.  For more details, check out this map of our tour:

<div>Every year, thousands flock to the Coachella Valley for its Music and Arts Festival. Just a short, twelve minute ride southeast of the festival location lies a different Coachella -- one not nearly as glamorous. It's actually quite the opposite: filthy, decaying, and in need of your help.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Shady Lane Mobilehome Park, located in Thermal, is home to about 40 migrant farmworkers and their families. The farmworkers at Shady Lane work long, hard hours at low wages that keep our food prices low. These low wages come at an enormous cost: dangerously poor living conditions.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Extended electricity outages are common, often leaving residents without air conditioning during the Coachella Valley's exceptionally hot summers. One resident fell ill when her home temperature reached 115°. Many families are forced to sleep outside when the heat is unbearable. Young people living at the park often must choose between using the Internet to do homework or staying cool. Running water shuts down for entire days, leaving residents unable to wash hands or take showers. The park's septic system frequently malfunctions, causing waste to overflow during rain season and when residents wash clothing and take baths. Homes are falling apart, letting rain and cockroaches inside. </div>

<p><i>Joseph, age 7, suffers from asthma. He uses a nebulizer to alleviate his symptoms, which are exacerbated by the Coachella Valley heat. His bedroom temperature often reaches over 100 degrees, because power outages are common during the summer. During one of Joseph's asthma attacks, the electricity malfunctioned and wiring of his nebulizer shocked him. Donate today to stabilize Joseph's home electricity.</i></p>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Instead of improving these conditions, the park owner neglected the residents and left the park unpermitted for years. In 2011, the owner took steps toward shutting down the park, which would have left the families at Shady Lane without anywhere to live. Residents do not want to leave; they are a tight-knit community that has lived in the park for generations. As Carina Felix, lifelong resident of the park, put it, ""To me, this park means home, family, hope.""<br/><br/>UC Irvine School of Law's pro bono Community and Economic Development Clinic (CED), in collaboration with California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA), is working to prevent the families at Shady Lane from being evicted and to improve their living conditions. CED and CRLA recently negotiated a settlement agreement with the owner that would allow a nonprofit organization to purchase the park at a reduced price. </div>

Our Forgotten Farmworkers
Every year, thousands flock to the Coachella Valley for its Music and Arts Festival. Just a short, twelve minute ride southeast of the festival location lies a different Coachella -- one not nearly as glamorous. It's actually quite the opposite: filthy, decaying, and in need of your help.

Shady Lane Mobilehome Park, located in Thermal, is home to about 40 migrant farmworkers and their families. The farmworkers at Shady Lane work long, hard hours at low wages that keep our food prices low. These low wages come at an enormous cost: dangerously poor living conditions.

Extended electricity outages are common, often leaving residents without air conditioning during the Coachella Valley's exceptionally hot summers. One resident fell ill when her home temperature reached 115°. Many families are forced to sleep outside when the heat is unbearable. Young people living at the park often must choose between using the Internet to do homework or staying cool. Running water shuts down for entire days, leaving residents unable to wash hands or take showers. The park's septic system frequently malfunctions, causing waste to overflow during rain season and when residents wash clothing and take baths. Homes are falling apart, letting rain and cockroaches inside. 




Joseph, age 7, suffers from asthma. He uses a nebulizer to alleviate his symptoms, which are exacerbated by the Coachella Valley heat. His bedroom temperature often reaches over 100 degrees, because power outages are common during the summer. During one of Joseph's asthma attacks, the electricity malfunctioned and wiring of his nebulizer shocked him. Donate today to stabilize Joseph's home electricity.


Instead of improving these conditions, the park owner neglected the residents and left the park unpermitted for years. In 2011, the owner took steps toward shutting down the park, which would have left the families at Shady Lane without anywhere to live. Residents do not want to leave; they are a tight-knit community that has lived in the park for generations. As Carina Felix, lifelong resident of the park, put it, ""To me, this park means home, family, hope.""UC Irvine School of Law's pro bono Community and Economic Development Clinic (CED), in collaboration with California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA), is working to prevent the families at Shady Lane from being evicted and to improve their living conditions. CED and CRLA recently negotiated a settlement agreement with the owner that would allow a nonprofit organization to purchase the park at a reduced price. 







The Project


Step 1: Residents take Control of their Park 


To take control of their park, residents incorporated Shady Lane Mobile Home Park, Inc. (SLMP), a registered nonprofit organization. SLMP's board includes residents of the park and will actively seek advice from all residents on decisions. With your help, SLMP will be able to purchase the park and finance the cost of a Conditional Use Permit. 



Step 2: Immediate Repairs to Improve Health Once it gains ownership of the park, SLMP intends to repair electricity to give families access to reliable air conditioning. It also hopes to connect water and sewage piping to regional water and sewage lines. This will end sewage overflows and ensure that families have access to reliable running water. These repairs are expected to dramatically improve resident health prospects.


Step 3: Long-Term Projects to Improve Quality of Life

Eventually, SLMP intends to replace worn-down mobile home units with new units to stop leakage and ensure long-term reliability of electricity. SLMP also hopes to construct a community center, with a playground for the kids! The residents are tight-knit, and a community center would give them a central location to celebrate birthdays and other special events together. 


Our First Goal: $225,000 

SLMP's first goal is set at $225,000 to finance the purchase of the park. Once we surpass this goal, SLMP will fundraise for the remainder of the costs. Please contact us if you have any questions.

Statement</u></b></p>
<p>The 2500 block of Alter Street, also known as Mabel Wilson Walk,
has provided generations of Central Boys and Girls Club members and their
families a place to relax, learn about agriculture through gardening, and a
safe haven for the community to engage in activities that they can utilize in
their everyday lives.</p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>Overview
and Goals</u></b></p>
<p>The
Central Club for Boys and Girls was founded by Mrs. Mabel Wilson in 1946. Her
vision was to create a safe environment for the families of the community to
foster physical, moral, and spiritual growth. With the assistance of Mrs.
Howard and Mrs. Fain, Mabel Wilson’s vision has given birth to five (5)
generations of safe community activities which includes The Boys and Girls
Scouts, 4-H Club, The gardening club, an annual harvest fair, and vacation
bible school.</p>
<p>Mabel
Wilson was a pillar of the community and was hailed as the backbone of the 2500
block of Alter Street. She wore many hats as a teacher, activist, creator, and
an innovator to the community. She has spent many years teaching vocational
skills to thousands of youth and adults in preparation for the professional
world. Those skills include typing, short hand, filing, public speaking,
posture, and basic office skills just to name a few. She also taught many
youths how to use the first computers and word processors.</p>
<p>Many
of these activities were funded from Mabel herself. She made table cloths and
aprons and spent many of nights at her sewing machine trying to keep up with
orders; cutting and framing glass, picking her flowers and produce from her
garden to sell, and art were sold to continue to keep the garden and all of the
activities going and thriving. With her growing list of activities and teaches
she used her life savings to purchase the house across the street from her so
that the community could have a place that the community could call their own,
which is now called the Scouts Community Center. After Mrs. Wilson’s passing in
2010 her son, Stanley Wilson, has been fighting to keep her garden and the club
going to keep her legacy alive. Maintaining the gardens, maintaining the
activities and the annual harvest fair is just the tip of the iceberg. Stanley
Wilson wants to make Mabel Wilson Walk what his mother would have wanted it to
be and more.</p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>Funding</u></b></p>
<p>Funding
to maintain the gardens as well as the duties of block captain and to keep the
legacy of his mother, Mabel Wilson, alive has been quite difficult for Stanley
Wilson. After suffering two (2) strokes recently, bleeding on the brain as well as other health
issues, he is unable to work and uses his pensions and travels the city of
Philadelphia to collect scrap metal to maintain these gardens and activities
for the Central Club for Boys and Girls. He still soldiers on to keep his
mother’s legacy alive, however, the funding is being stretched to its limits to
purchase essential gardening items such as fencing, seeds, plant food, and
other miscellaneous items.</p>
<p>There have been many
volunteers to come aide in the maintenance and care of the garden, however, the
Central Club for Boys and Girls would like to expand the garden on Mabel Wilson
Walk and have a place of their own to plant and harvest their own plots.
However, this is not feasible as funding is lax. Mr. Stanley Wilson and some
volunteers are funding everything through his monthly pensions which are not
sufficient in maintaining Mabel Wilson Walk, gardens, activities, events for
club members, and the annual fair which will be celebrating its 69<sup>th</sup>
year on August 8, 2015 to celebrate the legacy of Mabel Wilson.</p>
<p>The
funding that we receive will go towards an expansion of the garden on Mabel
Wilson Walk, sustainability of the Central Club for Boys and Girls, added

friends and professionals in order to create an efficient support team:
Nicoletta Melloni and Marinella Pignat joined the project. Together they began
to search materials, technologies and machining, perfectly suited to renew the
product and to make it fashionable in terms of quality and customization.</p>
<p>We have identified our
business partners, companies to share this project with and perfect associates
to create a flexible network. The goal will be to develop and  
    re-valorize Italian craftsmanship and design:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing new products</li>
<li>catching other objects from the past
     making them current</li>
<li>integrating new digital technologies

</div></div>","WHAT IS  UPWine is an ambitious
project, born to bring back to life objects belonging to Italian’s handcraft
and design related to wine’s market. Stoppers and Foilcutters functional,
colored, funny.
UPWine is a set of
stylish stoppers and foilcutters suitable for several different needs: it can
seal precious wine and beer bottles, providing elegance, fun, customization,
appeal, uniqueness... and ensuring perfect wine protection up to 48 hours.
Which of the available stoppers on the market con do that?
Moreover, UPWine
provides suitable gift packets for every special occasion,in particular for New
Year’s eve. THIS STORY
Andrea Radin, 30 years
old coming from Friuli, near Venice, is making the wish of an old local
entrepreneur come true, and is developing the UPWine project within his own
company: Spazio Rete srl.
He has been involving
friends and professionals in order to create an efficient support team:
Nicoletta Melloni and Marinella Pignat joined the project. Together they began
to search materials, technologies and machining, perfectly suited to renew the
product and to make it fashionable in terms of quality and customization.
We have identified our
business partners, companies to share this project with and perfect associates
to create a flexible network. The goal will be to develop and  
    re-valorize Italian craftsmanship and design:

developing new products
catching other objects from the past
     making them current
integrating new digital technologies
     (already under development)
involving designers and artists

THE THREEPrototypes have been created, stoppers’ capacity and
foilcutters’ functionality have been tested; now Andrea Radin and his team are
ready to show you the UPWine  line, a special gift both to make and to
receive.



The ""Stopper"" for Prosecco/Spumante/Champagne built to preserve effervescenze for at least 48 hours.









The ""Stopper"" for still wines that avoids oxidation, keeps scents and aromas for at least 48 hours.








The ""Foilcutter"" allows the removal of still wine's foil safety and quickly.

 DESIGN 


Starting from the former project, we have improved the design of
the UPWine products and we have enjoyed the process of studying and testing new
materials, new colors, new technologies, basically a whole new set of ideas


UPSparkly - UPstill stoppers and the UPCut foilcutter are available
in 5 different textures; the range goes from Basic to Soft Touch, including
Metallic and Material, up to our top line products, coated in both Gold or
White Gold finishing, named GOLDEN LEAF Classic Gold and GOLDEN LEAF White
Gold. 
For the Indiegogo Campaign, we planned to supply 16 different
colors distributed along the different textures:
1. Basic:  Matte Colors with Tactile Satin Finishing 
   
2. Soft Touch: Extra Matte Velvet Finishing  

3. Metallic: 
The surface mirrors Shiny Reflexes in the Colors of copper, Champagne, Gold and Acid Green
   
4. Materics: Embellished and Natural Effects, like Denim or Sahraian Camouflage Finishing. Each piece is unique, each one different from any other
   
5. GOLDEN Leaf Classic Gold and GOLDEN Leaf White gold: Handmade precious
coatings,  Counting up to 0,09 to 0,12
grams of white or classic Gold. Unique pieces, each one different from any other


For the indiegogo
campaign, we plan to supply the following packets:   

3 pieces box, including 1 UpSparky- 1 Upstill- 1 UpCut

Single piece havana box for Basic, Soft Touch, Metal and Material products

Single piece “elegance” box, designed for Leaf Classic Gold and Leaf White Gold

FEATURES
1. Materials

UPSparkly and UPStill do not contain any cork, wood, or other materials that might ruin the taste and aromas of the wine.
The three UPWine are made of plastic materials, mainly ABS, with soma metal components
2. Sustainability
The components are easily
detachable, allowing them to be immediately recyclable. For an easy dismissal
and recyclability.
3. Not Just wine, beer as well! Built for wine, suitable for beer
too!
UPSparkly and UPStill can also
be used to maintain the quality of craft beers in 75 cl bottles.


CAMPAIGNGOALS

After a whole year of hard
work we have perfectly accomplished our sampling which allowed us to optimize
the integration of different machinings. Now that our industrial partners have
been identified, it’s time to start with the effective production of these
fantastic objects.

These are the campaign
goals:

● 
GOAL 1 €25.000: full coverage of start-up production
costs for the first serie of UPWine, intended for pioneering donors of
Indiegogo

● 
GOAL 2 €80.000: development of UPWine 2.0, turning
the “cork” into a sharing system, entering the complex world of IoT (“Internet
of things”).

<p></p>
<p>Cum Get Sum LLC/ Sin Energy Drink is developing a new
social lifestyle energy drink formulated for men and women designed to provide
a healthier body, mental clarity, and stamina. Our key component is unique to
all of these qualities. The primary component is called an adaptogen. An
adaptogen helps balance the mind and body of each individual allowing it to adapt
and overcome obstacles with in that individual. Our product’s formulation is
based upon real life situations and can be used by those with diabetes or
kidney disease. It also acts as an antioxidant to remove toxins and can tonify
the kidneys and liver. </p>
<p>We are in the final stages of completing our formula
and releasing our product to consumers. We have distributors and independents
ready to place our product. There is no other product available at this time
that uses our formula engineering. This allows us a unique position in the
marketplace. We have combined the benefits of standard energy drinks and have
added todays most common sought after desire, sex. While most energy drinks are
made with the cheapest ingredients to maximize profits and rarely focus on the
consumers true overall health, we use only the best most natural ingredients
and have formulated our product to reduce most overlooked health dangers such
as phosphorus, carbohydrates, caffeine, calories, sugars, and sodium. Our
founders have experienced firsthand the problems that can arise from the
consumption of most of today’s energy drinks on the market. It is our goal to
affect a change for the future and provide a product that works to benefit each
individual both short and long term. </p>
<p>We have found through countless research the
increasing numbers in those that are unable to enjoy an energy drink product
because it does not meet all the desires and health issues of the consumer;
including cost. The availability of our product will open many consumption
avenues for individuals that currently do not exist. Our pricing is comparative
to market standards and by removing unnecessary expenses we will not only be
successful but able to continue to develop and introduce new products in the
future.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp;
What You Get</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are seeking
contributions of $25,000 to help complete the formula of our product. Product
development can be quite expensive especially when you are creating something
that does not exist. Our founders have personally funded this project to get to
this point and will continue to do so in order to bring our product to a very
much needed market. We believe that utilizing this type of funding forum we
will be able to increase awareness and overall customer base. Our cost may be
reduced as our scientific research continues. </p>
<p>Our rewards or perks
allow people to be part of something bigger than just another energy drink
company. It allows contributors and non-contributors to be part of a campaign
that reaches out to those that feel the constant weight of “can I” or “can’t I“.</p>
<p>1. Individuals with
diabetes, kidney and liver problems are limited to or denied every day products
most enjoy do to the ingredients, additives, and preservatives they contain,
including energy drinks. Thanks to you our product can reduce some of that
weight and allow them to enjoy something that so many others do.  </p>
<p>2. Individuals that need
a boost in the desire department that do not want, need, or can’t take
prescription enhancement drugs. Thanks to you our product can fuel ones desires
with a balanced natural increase of fluids inside the body to the appropriate
location for both men and women without concern only performance.</p>
<p>3. Sport hip/ trendy
apparel that is guaranteed to get you noticed, open a conversation, and in some
cases attract the opposite sex. All thanks to you.  </p>
<p>All funds received if
funding goal is not met will go towards the above mentioned campaign. Any
additional funding beyond the goal will be allotted to social media, website
enhancement, and entering into full production.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Our products impact in
the market allows a significant change in the social lifestyle scene. We
provide an all-in-one energy drink that addresses many issues. Allowing the
adaptation of an individual’s mind and body naturally. A product that can be
enjoyed by individuals without the side effects and potential dangers of other
products available (legal or illegal). To be able to enhance a mood, increase
performance, balance the body, and calm the mind all at once. A product that
does not deny those with increasingly becoming common health issues.</p>
<p>As stated earlier our
founders have dealt with these issues first hand. For instance, one of our
founders has brother that is 30 years of age and suffering from Diabetes and
End Stage Renal Disease or ESRD. His condition is due to the direct use of
energy drinks. His diabetes caused him to feel tired and constantly out of
energy. In order for to make it through a work day he would use energy drinks
to get him thru. While he was able to control his sugars with insulin he was
not aware that the overlooked phosphorus and sodium content along with the
diabetes itself was slowly damaging his kidneys. He is now on dialysis and
awaiting a transplant. His life consists of daily dialysis and doctors’
appointments. Our founder being involved with his daily care has actively got
involved with the research of products available for those in his situation. The
treatment in itself is exhausting and creates a multitude of other issues.
Products available today cannot be used by someone in his condition and should
be carefully considered by others that may have the potential for his
condition.  We are dedicated to the
completion and production of our product. We have combined an edginess to
attract all consumers and a bit of hip to those that face so much. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b></p>
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<p>Our strengths stand in the unique formulation of our
product. We do not follow the same path that so many others have chosen in
formulating there product. Many simply try to reproduce what others have
already done. We have found that this is the biggest problem when trying to
compete with the majors. Many of the standard ingredients in today’s energy
drinks are becoming old news and in some cases attracting negative attention.
Consumers are looking for not only something new but different than the others.
Our pricing and the unique formulation of our product is a direct answer to the
consumers.</p>
<p><b>Threats</b></p>
<p>We believe the biggest threat we face is that there is
no way to protect the replication of our product once on the market. The law
does not allow us or any other beverage company to copy write or patent a
formula for a product. We have been very careful not to release too much
information about our product with regards to exact formulation. We have also
taken the steps to require non- disclosures with those we have relationships.
We have not allowed samples to be distributed so that we can minimize the possibilities
of replication. We have legal counsel on retainer and will have insurances in
place to help protect us from situations.</p>
<p><b>The Competitors</b></p>
<p>In the energy drink beverages industry, customers make
choices based upon taste, effect, and cost. The largest levels of competition
in the market are the majors. Red Bull and Monster account for about 70% of the
market. This may seem high but compared to five years ago when they held 90%
they are losing ground every year due to new products and manufactures entering
the market. Outside of this we feel the level of competition is moderate due to
the many variations of the energy drink market. From waters to energy shots. We
find solace in social lifestyle. </p>

increase to over $18 billion by year 2018. Furthermore, the market currently is
becoming the new soda or lifestyle beverage for age demographics ranging from

interaction through social media, celebrity endorsements, radio/TV, and local
publications. We have already started this process and have found great
success. We do plan to interact with certain big venue events annually to
establish hands on relationship with our consumers. These methods are best for
our product since it is about helping consumers fulfill desires of an enhanced
social lifestyle. We found that the success of new products was largely
contributed to branding and creating a demand before availability. Companies
that spend countless dollars in manufacturing and production before creating a
brand and demand take longer to profit and in some instances end up with

<p>Mohave Roots Farmer's Market is a worker-owner cooperative Farmer's Market located on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus. Our market features fresh produce exclusively from local sources, sold monthly out of the UNLV Student Union Courtyard. Our market is open to all UNLV students, as well as the general public, and to any local producers looking for a place to sell their bounty.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for $10,000 for:<br/></p> <p>- Procuring our local produce to sell at our tables</p>
<p>- All of the working pieces of the market proper, such as the coolers to keep the produce fresh right up to the point we sell it, a dedicated vehicle to transport our goods from the farmers to the market, tables and canopies to set up on and under, a card reader system to allow for more convenient purchasing, and lastly bags and other packaging to help you bring your purchase back to your dorm or home (your own reusable bags are welcome too!)</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our Farmer's Market is built for students, and their need for a healthy diet. Our location is right in the middle of the Student Union Courtyard, just a short walk away from the student dorms. All of our produce is sourced from local producers, and helps to support the Vegas green community. </p>
<p>One of our larger sources are the K-12 schools in local Las Vegas neighborhoods, picked from the Garden Farms School Gardens program, supporting student education in home gardening and food resilience.<br/></p>
<p>We also support any and all local producers, from the commercial farms to the home gardens and more. We accept any produce available for sale from Las Vegas citizens, working to build a support structure for local production of foods, as well as the network of farmers and gardeners available in the valley. The more we grow, the more we can support and grow the local food supply, the more produce is available without the need for transport from across the country, providing fresher produce and more resilient communities, in both food and income sustainability.</p>
<p>Our operations structure is based on the Worker-Owner Cooperative Movement, a system that allows all workers to take part in the operations as if the company was their own. This type of management allows for more pride in one's work, as every task is an improvement of one's own business, and all proceeds are shared and distributed equally amongst all of the workers. In place of the boss-supervisor structure, management is elected from the workers, by the workers; allowing for empowerment of the individual worker to determine the actions of the business instead of just following the orders of officers that aren't privy to the needs of the ground operations. This lets the market run more fluidly, allowing for a better community atmosphere.</p>
<p>Utilizing this structure at the market also allows for the education of both worker-owners and volunteers in Worker-Owner Cooperative model, which has the capabilities of being implemented in many other business types. This allows for the system to spread into our communities by providing a model for local small businesses, which again leads to developing community resilience, all the while selling healthy foods. </p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>- Another Valley Farmer's Market</div> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">There are many different farmer's markets in the Las Vegas valley, and many outlets for our local producers. While the abundance of locations is a boon for the valley and it's health, none of them are located in an area central to our college students. So, while the competition is numerous, we have a base of customers that can't easily access these locations, and based on our survey of the UNLV student body, there is a high demand for our Market and it produce. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Also, our Market is dedicated to produce and produce only in order to support our local producers. Many of our other markets have their produce intertwined with dairy products and craft items. With our goals of providing the student body and surrounding neighborhoods healthy foods to eat, we have a unique market that sets itself apart in its vision.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">- Local Produce Availability</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">With the exception of a few commercial producers, local produce is hard to come by in the valley. The UNLV campus is no different, located in an area with only a few supermarkets within relative walking distance, and not much more within a reasonable distance for bus travel while staying fresh. Almost all of the produce available is imported, from California to out of the country.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Mohave Roots Farmer's Market is a worker-owner cooperative Farmer's Market located on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus. Our market features fresh produce exclusively from local sources, sold monthly out of the UNLV Student Union Courtyard. Our market is open to all UNLV students, as well as the general public, and to any local producers looking for a place to sell their bounty.

  What We Need & What You Get
We are looking for $10,000 for: - Procuring our local produce to sell at our tables
- All of the working pieces of the market proper, such as the coolers to keep the produce fresh right up to the point we sell it, a dedicated vehicle to transport our goods from the farmers to the market, tables and canopies to set up on and under, a card reader system to allow for more convenient purchasing, and lastly bags and other packaging to help you bring your purchase back to your dorm or home (your own reusable bags are welcome too!)   
The Impact
Our Farmer's Market is built for students, and their need for a healthy diet. Our location is right in the middle of the Student Union Courtyard, just a short walk away from the student dorms. All of our produce is sourced from local producers, and helps to support the Vegas green community. 
One of our larger sources are the K-12 schools in local Las Vegas neighborhoods, picked from the Garden Farms School Gardens program, supporting student education in home gardening and food resilience.
We also support any and all local producers, from the commercial farms to the home gardens and more. We accept any produce available for sale from Las Vegas citizens, working to build a support structure for local production of foods, as well as the network of farmers and gardeners available in the valley. The more we grow, the more we can support and grow the local food supply, the more produce is available without the need for transport from across the country, providing fresher produce and more resilient communities, in both food and income sustainability.
Our operations structure is based on the Worker-Owner Cooperative Movement, a system that allows all workers to take part in the operations as if the company was their own. This type of management allows for more pride in one's work, as every task is an improvement of one's own business, and all proceeds are shared and distributed equally amongst all of the workers. In place of the boss-supervisor structure, management is elected from the workers, by the workers; allowing for empowerment of the individual worker to determine the actions of the business instead of just following the orders of officers that aren't privy to the needs of the ground operations. This lets the market run more fluidly, allowing for a better community atmosphere.
Utilizing this structure at the market also allows for the education of both worker-owners and volunteers in Worker-Owner Cooperative model, which has the capabilities of being implemented in many other business types. This allows for the system to spread into our communities by providing a model for local small businesses, which again leads to developing community resilience, all the while selling healthy foods.    
Risks & Challenges

- Another Valley Farmer's Market There are many different farmer's markets in the Las Vegas valley, and many outlets for our local producers. While the abundance of locations is a boon for the valley and it's health, none of them are located in an area central to our college students. So, while the competition is numerous, we have a base of customers that can't easily access these locations, and based on our survey of the UNLV student body, there is a high demand for our Market and it produce. 
Also, our Market is dedicated to produce and produce only in order to support our local producers. Many of our other markets have their produce intertwined with dairy products and craft items. With our goals of providing the student body and surrounding neighborhoods healthy foods to eat, we have a unique market that sets itself apart in its vision.
- Local Produce Availability
With the exception of a few commercial producers, local produce is hard to come by in the valley. The UNLV campus is no different, located in an area with only a few supermarkets within relative walking distance, and not much more within a reasonable distance for bus travel while staying fresh. Almost all of the produce available is imported, from California to out of the country. Our partnerships with local growers allows food to be bought at it's freshest, sometimes picked within hours of our selling it. We also work to support programs that intend to increase our local harvests, including hydroponic operations to bring more food to the valley while conserving precious water in our current drought conditions.

<h3> <b>ABOUT MY DISTILLERY BUSINESS<br/></b>
</h3>My name is Chris Myles and first off, let me say thanks for looking at my indiegogo campaign. I hope it appeals to you and you'll tell your friends about it. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.  <br/><br/>For many years I've dreamed of operating a small distillery that would make high quality, hand-crafted specialty liquor. I've been distilling for a long time and had a working knowledge of what would be needed to build and operate a small distillery.  In 2012 I put the wheels in motion. I didn't have much money but I knew I could use my background in metalworking, plumbing, welding and other mechanical trades to keep the up front cost to a minimum. I've always live by the motto: Why buy when you can build?<br/><br/>I tackled establishing the business and obtaining all the federal and state permits and licenses on my own so nothing was spent on professional fees. That was no small effort and took the best part of two years but persistence was the key. I built the still, fermenters, grinder and other equipment and incorporated some salvaged materials wherever I could to reduce costs. My gear isn't very high-tech or photogenic but it all gets the job done nicely (see my gallery page here). The building I've rented and set up in isn't flashy either but it's affordable, entirely suitable and in a great location in the heart of apple orchard country. I've dedicated every penny I had to starting this distillery and now, after hundreds of hours of work, we're established, fully licensed and have created and successfully test 
marketed a unique product: Holy Terror Farm Brand Apple Jack. It looks like we're perched on the brink of success.<br/><h3>ABOUT THE PRODUCT</h3>
<br/>My distillery is located on the Holy Terror Farm just outside of Paonia, Colorado so the landlord and I agreed to call my apple jack HOLY TERROR FARM BRAND APPLE JACK. It's triple distilled to 80 proof (40% ABV) and made from beautiful, organically and locally grown apples that I personally picked (thousands of pounds) in a nearby orchard last fall. (I think I'll get some help with that next year!) Making my apple jack involves grinding and fermenting the apples with specially developed yeast and then running that ""mash"" through my handmade 50 gallon pot still in three successive runs. The resulting distilled liquor is then carefully ""cut"" to produce the best flavor and aroma and every bottle is individually filled and labeled  by hand.<br/><br/>Holy Terror Farm Brand Apple Jack has been especially popular with the farm-to-table restaurants. Having a small batch, locally made spirit to serve their patrons perfectly rounds out their farm-to-table menu.<br/><br/>
<p>The consensus among many volunteer taste testers is that my apple jack is incredibly smooth with apple essence and fragrance. Some enjoy drinking it straight-up and others find that it makes excellent cocktails and they've invented a few recipes for those. Eventually I'll be aging half of each run in charred oak barrels to produce apple jack with the character of a fine brandy. I've purchased barrels but need to achieve a constant flow of liquor out/revenue in before I can justify sequestering 50 gallons of apple jack in a barrel for twelve months. <br/></p>
<p>Holy Terror Farm Brand Apple Jack is currently being served in numerous local restaurants and bars and is available at several local liquor stores. Repeat sales are ongoing.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>WHY I NEED A BOOST</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, I've exhausted my funds and full production is still a few steps away. I can continue producing in very small ""test"" runs but getting the fermenters fully charged and creating a steady flow of fermented apples and bottled apple jack is going to take more time than I have capital to cover. Keeping the lights on through the next three to four months, while apples ferment in the tanks and the finishing touches are put on the distillery, is the challenge.<br/></p>
<p>The current break-even point for my distillery amounts to 
selling 14 cases (168 bottles) of Holy Terror Farm Brand Apple Jack a 
month. As you can imagine that's not a lot of liquor to sell statewide 
and I'm reasonably confident that I'll exceed that in short order. The 
product virtually sells itself everywhere it goes and I always have 
retailers waiting for the next batch to be bottled.</p>
<p>Covering four months of expenses amounts to $6700.00 (USD) so that's the amount I'm seeking with this campaign.<br/></p>
<h3>ABOUT MYLES BROTHERS</h3>
<h3>SPIRITS &amp; DISTILLING LLC<br/>
</h3>
<p>Just thought that I should mention that this business is (so far at least) a one man operation, When I was deciding what to name my business I thought that Myles Brothers had a nice ""traditional"" ring to it and my brothers had no objections.</p>
<h3>FUTURE PLANS<br/>
</h3>Apples are seasonal and costly to store so there's likely to be a regular stretch in the summer when I should focus on a different product. That will be the opportunity to start developing some unique small-batch whisky. That was actually my original plan but the abundance of apples here inspired me to try something out of the ordinary. There are several local growers of organic Barley, rye and corn and I'll be talking to them soon but for now the focus is on apple jack. Eventually I hope to have a full line of distilled liquor products. Making some larger fermenting tanks will be my next structural upgrade.<br/>Long term plans include building a tasting room and retail sales office on site and hiring some help.<br/><br/>Again, thanks for looking. I truly appreciate any level of help you may provide.<br/>          Chris Myles<br/>

Our goal is to make a difference in someone's life, if only for a brief moment.  One way to meet our goal is to provide services that our guests cannot afford on their own.  Since fresh fruits and vegetables are not usually available at food pantries, our guests are very appreciative when they receive a bag of fresh produce.  
  Risks & Challenges The fresh fruits and vegetables stand is a popular destination for our guests.  This year we are planning for a minimum of 300 families to receive the produce which means we need to raise at least $3,500.  Without donations, we are not able to provide fresh fruits and vegetables.  
  Other Ways You Can Help 
In addition to monetary donations, Joliet Cares is all about volunteering.  Hundreds of volunteers make Joliet Cares possible.  To volunteer, fill out the online form at: www.jolietcares.org/volunteer.htm.
Clothing donations and personal care items are also needed for our event. Contact info@jolietcares.org for more information.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

What is the difference?

What you get?


Other Ways You Can Help








 /// A VERY SHORT INTRODUCTION.
 We asked our designers ""Why you put so much stuff? Wasn’t the idea all to be clear?"".

From all the mumbo-jumbo (4 hours later…) we did get the idea that 
      most of the web sites are really not using all of the screen space 
      anyway so why not put something useful there. (Reference: cnn.com, 
      techcrunch.com, engadget.com and etc.).
After we were convinced that we have to go this way.
We said: ""Why so trekkie?""
Well…… that turned out to be us, we are all fans of Star Trek, Marvel
      and etc. and we should do something that is space like otherwise why 
      bother.

      Never the less it turned out far more than just futuristic. We reached a level of clarity we did not expect.



 /// WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?

It’s all about information delivery.
Our development as a species is tightly connected to the tools we use to gather, process and share information.
More effective information delivery means faster and faster results.
All the browsers today cannot use the super powerful hardware you put
        in your machine very effectively. Which limits the possibilities to 
        represent information in more useful and comprehensive way.

And if the information representation tools stay the same we stay the same.



 Our Vision


We
            want to build information visualization system that is compatible with 
            the current web and be able to extend it to new levels of software and 
            hardware integration.


A system that will be able to deliver huge amount of information in a far more comprehensive and easy to use way.


A system that can learn from you and evolve with your understanding of the world around you.


Search


How it is supposed to search for me? Isn’t that too far ahead in the future?

The Hydrogen Browser learns from you, analyzes how you are using it. On this particular basis it is able to suggest new ways of finding and organizing information which does not mean that Hydrogen Browser is something like Big Brother. It means that you can control and manage the perpetual searches and exactly what to observe. It can search the web 24/7 for new information based on your criteria.



 /// USER INTERFACE

 Completely new experience 
 



We’ve decided to create a completely new experience for you. The web evolves and the browser should evolve with it.


Live Tiles 


 


Live Tiles are your new way to navigate trough the opened browsers. You can change the active web browser by just clicking on it.

          The image inside the tile is always  live so if you have opened video or something interesting happens in the browser window you will see it immediately.


Advanced search 


 


As we want to do our information exchange faster and faster it makes sense to be able to search in more then one place without changing the current browser window. So we integrated the second search which is always there on the right.

          When you define perpetual searches the notifications for new content will be visualized in this section too.


Favorites & History 


 


 
So far Favorites was a somewhat side functionality of a browser and never organized very well. 

        So we decided to change that. 

        Favorites in Hydrogen Browser  are always represented with large image snapshot of the site as you decide to make it a favorite so it will look exactly how you see it at the moment. 

        We combined Favorites and History into to the same window as they have very similar use and functionality.
        

Browser controls 






Organized the browser controls in a easy and comprehensive way so it is clear that it affect the browser window. 

          You can refresh, add to favorites, resize the browser window to full width or close the browser window.


Browser settings and main navigation 






The main navigation is simple and intuitive. 
          In settings you can setup the home page  and new window default page address. 


Very easy access to your downloads.


Email Client

          The integrated email client is secure, protects your correspondence from unauthorized access and as any other system in the web browser that collects information the AI can help you find and organize information. 

          When you browse a website you can immediately see all the correspondence with this domain and many other features to filter and locate information. 
Messenger

          Integrated messenger keeps you connected with your love once, friends and business contacts. 
          Here are some of the features you will love.
        

The integrated possibility to split the contacts into different groups and set online statuses to different groups lets you controls who sees what.
The messenger supports multiple accounts so you can integrate your home and your business account into one place without switching anything.
Separate download folders for each chat and chat group give you far better document and files management.

Calendar

          Calendar is an intricate part of the whole system it can remind and keep track of important events.

          You can sync the calendar between all your devices.

          As Calendar has multiple manager support you can give permissions to other people to manage your calendar for you. 
Task manager

          It’s only fitting to have a task manager too. The task manager syncs all your task to all your devices. 


 /// FOR BUSINESSES


Why should you care?

          Context search give us the possibility to build far more intelligent systems as the system have information of what and how you gather information. All the information is anonymized on its way out so the anonymity is preserved in all cases.

          The browser is aware what your interests are and help you find and manage information.

          The importance for your business are really significant because you can create marketing campaign that can achieve  tremendously better results as it reaches audience that really care about your product. 

Better results means less money spent.

          The web browser integrate all your infrastructure into one system - website, mobile apps, marketing campaign, client support and messaging all in one box.

<h3>In A Nutshell<br/>
</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><i>ARTZ
Philadelphia is a community service organization whose mission is to enhance the quality of life of people with dementia and those who love them. During our first full year of service last year, we raised  approximately $30,000 to support quality of life, arts-centered programming for people still living in their own homes and for people living in residential care communities throughout Greater Philadelphia. Now we need your help to raise $15,000 so that we can continue to reach out to people living with dementia through our existing programs and so that we can expand to meet the increasing demand for what we offer.</i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>A Bit More Detail
<b> </b>
</h3>
<p><i>ARTZ
Philadelphia was founded in July of 2013.</i> Six months later, we began to design
and deliver programs for people living with dementia and their families in the
Greater Philadelphia area.<span>  </span></p>
<p><i>By July of
2014</i>, we were offering one program each month at a local museum for people
still living in their own homes and one program each month at a local
care community for memory care residents. We were doing this <i>pro bono</i>, without access to any outside funding yet. And unlike most arts-centered
programs for people with dementia, ARTZ Philadelphia’s initiatives welcome
people at all stages of illness, from mild cognitive impairment through to late
stage dementia. Because the human need for self-expression, the joy of
creativity, the joy in community do not disappear with a diagnosis.</p>
<p><i>In Summer 2014
we launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise our first operating and program
funds.</i> The funds we secured in that campaign and the 100 supporters who donated in
amounts large and small made it possible for us to expand our programs in
museums from one each month to three each month. In care communities, we
went from once-monthly to multiple visits each month in multiple memory care
units.<span>  We went from reaching an average
of 200 people living with dementia and their care partners annually to reaching
more than 1000.</span></p>
<p>But what does
that really mean? <i>It’s not the numbers
that are important, it’s the people.</i><span> 
So a 500% increase in the number of people we were able to reach meant a
500% increase in the relationships we were able to build, one by one, person to
person, with people living with dementia in our communities. </span></p>
<p><i>Now, we want to do
it again.</i></p>
<p><i>We at ARTZ
Philadelphia have just celebrated our second birthday.</i><span>  We now provide programs in three museums and art
centers and in seven residential care communities around the Greater
Philadelphia area.  We have four more
arts partners waiting in the wings, ready to open their doors to people living
with dementia and their families as soon as we have the funding to launch new
programs at their venues.  We have four
more care communities whose memory care residents would have access to our
arts-based conversation and creation programs if we could secure the funding to
bring “ARTZ on the Road” to them. </span></p>
<p><b><i>We need your
help. We need you to join us in #MakingADifference. It takes a village.</i></b></p>

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Who We Are<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>ARTZ
Philadelphia was created in July of 2013 as the first mid-Atlantic affiliate of
the not-for-profit ARTZ/Artists for Alzheimers. Founded in the Boston area in 2002, ARTZ strives
to foster a sense of creative community among people living with dementias of
all kinds and their care partners; and to restore to people living with
dementia their rightful place as valued members of our wider community.</p>ARTZ
Philadelphia is currently staffed by one full-time professional and a small and
passionate group of volunteers. Susan Shifrin is the founding director of ARTZ
Philadelphia. She was inspired to start up this mid-Atlantic affiliate after
having hosted a series of ARTZ workshops and trainings at the Berman Museum of
Art at Ursinus College, where she served for a number of years as the museum educator. She was profoundly affected by watching visitors –
often in the later stages of dementia – come alive in the Museum as they looked
at and talked about art together with her, with their care partners, and with
the college students who worked at the Museum. Art fast became a vehicle for
expression, interaction, creativity and mutual respect in people who – in some
cases – had rarely spoken about aspects of their lives that looking at works of
art reawakened in them.<br/><br/><p>Susan’s mother
was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease in 2002.</p><p><br/></p>
<div>
<h3>Why Is There a Need for ARTZ Philadelphia?<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>36,000,000
people worldwide are currently living with the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease. Millions more have been diagnosed with dementias of other kinds. Over five

<p>ARTZ Philadelphia was founded on the
belief that people living with dementia should be accorded the benefits of
well-being and quality of life that others enjoy. We provide cultural and
creative opportunities that turn that belief into reality. We are committed to
supporting and celebrating people with dementia and their care partners as
valued members of our wider creative community.</p>
<p>We offer
opportunities for self-expression and for the rebuilding of self-esteem and
dignity to people with memory loss and those who care for them. We
achieve this mission through research-based programs that connect people living
with dementia and their care partners with artists and cultural organizations
in creative community.<span><br/>

<br/> </div></div>","In A Nutshell


ARTZ
Philadelphia is a community service organization whose mission is to enhance the quality of life of people with dementia and those who love them. During our first full year of service last year, we raised  approximately $30,000 to support quality of life, arts-centered programming for people still living in their own homes and for people living in residential care communities throughout Greater Philadelphia. Now we need your help to raise $15,000 so that we can continue to reach out to people living with dementia through our existing programs and so that we can expand to meet the increasing demand for what we offer.

A Bit More Detail
 

ARTZ
Philadelphia was founded in July of 2013. Six months later, we began to design
and deliver programs for people living with dementia and their families in the
Greater Philadelphia area.  
By July of
2014, we were offering one program each month at a local museum for people
still living in their own homes and one program each month at a local
care community for memory care residents. We were doing this pro bono, without access to any outside funding yet. And unlike most arts-centered
programs for people with dementia, ARTZ Philadelphia’s initiatives welcome
people at all stages of illness, from mild cognitive impairment through to late
stage dementia. Because the human need for self-expression, the joy of
creativity, the joy in community do not disappear with a diagnosis.
In Summer 2014
we launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise our first operating and program
funds. The funds we secured in that campaign and the 100 supporters who donated in
amounts large and small made it possible for us to expand our programs in
museums from one each month to three each month. In care communities, we
went from once-monthly to multiple visits each month in multiple memory care
units.  We went from reaching an average
of 200 people living with dementia and their care partners annually to reaching
more than 1000.
But what does
that really mean? It’s not the numbers
that are important, it’s the people. 
So a 500% increase in the number of people we were able to reach meant a
500% increase in the relationships we were able to build, one by one, person to
person, with people living with dementia in our communities. 
Now, we want to do
it again.
We at ARTZ
Philadelphia have just celebrated our second birthday.  We now provide programs in three museums and art
centers and in seven residential care communities around the Greater
Philadelphia area.  We have four more
arts partners waiting in the wings, ready to open their doors to people living
with dementia and their families as soon as we have the funding to launch new
programs at their venues.  We have four
more care communities whose memory care residents would have access to our
arts-based conversation and creation programs if we could secure the funding to
bring “ARTZ on the Road” to them. 
We need your
help. We need you to join us in #MakingADifference. It takes a village.





   Who We Are
 

ARTZ
Philadelphia was created in July of 2013 as the first mid-Atlantic affiliate of
the not-for-profit ARTZ/Artists for Alzheimers. Founded in the Boston area in 2002, ARTZ strives
to foster a sense of creative community among people living with dementias of
all kinds and their care partners; and to restore to people living with
dementia their rightful place as valued members of our wider community.ARTZ
Philadelphia is currently staffed by one full-time professional and a small and
passionate group of volunteers. Susan Shifrin is the founding director of ARTZ
Philadelphia. She was inspired to start up this mid-Atlantic affiliate after
having hosted a series of ARTZ workshops and trainings at the Berman Museum of
Art at Ursinus College, where she served for a number of years as the museum educator. She was profoundly affected by watching visitors –
often in the later stages of dementia – come alive in the Museum as they looked
at and talked about art together with her, with their care partners, and with
the college students who worked at the Museum. Art fast became a vehicle for
expression, interaction, creativity and mutual respect in people who – in some
cases – had rarely spoken about aspects of their lives that looking at works of
art reawakened in them.Susan’s mother
was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease in 2002.

Why Is There a Need for ARTZ Philadelphia?
 
36,000,000
people worldwide are currently living with the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease. Millions more have been diagnosed with dementias of other kinds. Over five
million live in the United States, 400,000 in Pennsylvania, and approximately
100,000 in the Greater Philadelphia area alone. 
Almost once a minute, someone else in the United States is given a new diagnosis of dementia. 
Despite the
best efforts of scientists over the last forty years and $500,000,000 in public
funds spent annually, we still have no cure for dementia. We have no way to even
slow the progress of these illnesses. The funding efforts worldwide remain
focused on research for a cure, and yet the diagnosis of dementia condemns people
living with it to increasingly isolated and stigmatized lives, often emptied of
creativity and community.
What are we
doing for them while we wait for a cure? 
What are we doing for them now?

with dementia and their care partners with artists and cultural organizations
in creative community.

<p>Trevor cannot go outside and play. In fact, he can barely breathe
on his own and over the last few years, all his hair has fallen out. Although
he has his whole life in front of him, Trevor will not be able to do any of the
things that children do. He has developed an immune disease from breathing the
smoke that the burning dumpsite near his home has been emitting for years. Will
you help prevent more children fall pretty to toxic emissions near homes? </p>

<p>Lois Marie Gibbs
founded the Center for Health, Environment &amp; Justice (CHEJ) to build
healthy communities nationwide, with social justice, economic well-being and
democratic governance. We help community groups research the extent
of problems like leaking landfills, polluted drinking water, incinerators, or hazardous waste sites; break it down into manageable “action steps,” and then develop
the leadership skills and knowledge needed to be able to carry out those steps.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center; background-color: initial;"">     </span></p>

What we raise through Indiegogo will go towards the start-up of In Gratitude Always.  While our goal is $30,000, we intend to succeed in the start-up of this business even if we don't reach our entire goal.  Any amount of support we receive is a blessing and will help us make this dream a reality!  So give if you can, and pass the information about our campaign along to anyone you know, even if you can't give. 
The Impact


T-shirts are an important component of our world’s wardrobe.  We buy and wear them for many different
reasons – celebration, expression, remembrance, advertising, comfort.  T-shirts allow the artists of our world to
display their works in a living, movable fashion. 



In addition to employing artists, graphic designers and printing engineers,
In Gratitude Always will serve
as a vocational training location and an employer of people with autism.  Partnering with the Charleston Autism
Academy, trained behavior therapists will be part of our team, working
alongside our vocational trainees.  



                                   

Laura's son, Aaron, will likely be our first employee with autism.  Some 50,000 people with autism are reaching adulthood each year over the next decade in our country.  We recognize that vocational opportunities for people with autism are extremely
rare in our local area and nationwide. 
We hope to create a template for other printing businesses to use in the
future to create similar vocational opportunities around the country.  

Risks and Challenges

Obstacles to achieving our mission are fairly great, although not insurmountable. We need money to equipment and supplies, money to hire a behavior support specialist, and money for an ongoing marketing campaign. You can help by donating to our cause and by sharing our campaign with others.
As we see it, the risk we are taking is in the time and effort required to build this unique company and the money we are able to put into it.  Most of what we have to work with is ""sweat equity.""  We believe that with smart planning, promotion, and economic use of the resources we have available to us that we can make this work.  We do not expect this to be easy, but then again most important things are not easy ones. 
Other Ways You Can Help


If you can't contribute to our campaign, we certainly do understand.  Please consider passing the information regarding our campaign on to others who would be interested to learn of our project.  Share with others on social media and make some noise for adults with autism!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

of my grandparents who grew up during the Great Depression.  I was in the fields before I could

preserving the fleeting knowledge of homesteading.  It is this
pursuit to preserve that  knowledge that has lead me to start
Freeman Tents and Outdoor Supplies. Who in the very near future will
be opening a Primitive Learning Center.  Freeman Tents manufactures

<b>I need your help in reaching the world! </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Freeman Tents was started for so many reasons. One of those reasons was to bring people home. We have forgotten and in some cases afraid of the world we call the “wilderness”. It has become a place only the brave dare to explore. We have created products and paired products to make the transition back to the great outdoors as convenient and simple as possible. We are a learning center teaching skills to live in a forgotten world. We offer knowledge, honesty, integrity and passion as our business model. We will never stop in our mission to offer the best of the best. Freeman Tents is not just a company it is a lifestyle. We love the outdoors and strive to be one with it again.</b><br/>

<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Who We Are</b><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">At first glance Freeman Tents is a
canvas wall tent and outdoor supply company. When you look deeper you
will see that is just the beginning of what will become a wilderness
survival learning center.  A company that will give back as much as
it receives.  We are a one stop shop for all your camps needs.  It is
our goal and dream to not only give you the equipment but also the
knowledge and skill set to live in nature very comfortably.  People
have been living in tents for thousands of years, some still do. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span>
</div><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We
have big goals and big dreams to preserve the old ways being lost to
convenience. Growing up on my grandparents farm I see how important
the information is that could easily be lost in a generation. The
fact that “homesteading” is being taught in colleges today
confirms these ways of life are becoming history quickly. We are
dedicated to sharing the joys to nature with the whole world,
starting with your family!</span><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1214980/files/20150211125512-010.jpg?1423688112"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/><br/><br/><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Where Are We Now</b><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have spent two years researching
and developing our canvas wall tents and connecting with suppliers
for our online outdoors store. We offer wood stoves in complete
packages, meaning it is fully functional right out of the box and
made in America! Canvas wall tents will last 30 years if you take proper care of them. So you can pass this tent on the net generation of campers! </span>

<p>Sod Cloth: 10” Vinyl sewn around the bottom inside of the tent.
This can be covered with dirt “sod” or sand bags creating a
weather seal.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Ridge Pole Sleeves: These are openings at the top of the tent
front and back to extend the ridge poles for awnings.  They are wide enough to set up an A-frame style ridge line. You can use logs as the ridge line support. Lots of resorts that have tents for glamping use this style, it looks incredible. You can also use a rope and traditionals poles. You have options when it comes to frames. You can also ask for eave sleeves to be added giving you a much easier way to add the awning to your tent. </p>
<p>Ropes and Tensioners: We provide ropes and metal tensioners. 
</p>
<p>Steel Stakes: 12” are for the ropes and 10” for around the
tent. 
</p>
<p>5' Walls: Walls come standard at 5'. You can choose to have them
6'.  </p>
<p>Each tent comes in a bag. It is recommended that you store the
tent in a rubber bin of some sort. If you cook in the tent it will have
residue from cooking and may attract mice which would eat through the
bag and ruin your tent with holes. The bag is for easy transport. The
tent should always be COMPLETELY dry before packing it away. 
</p>
<p>Webbing is sewn in around the bottom of the tent for strength. We
use heavy duty grommets on the bottom and across the eaves for
staking the tent to the ground and  anchoring it with guy lines. </p>
<p>Many more features can be added when you build your tent. </p>
<br/><br/></span></div><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">By offering digitally printed fire retardant
banners I have created ways to help decorate your tent. You can print
any image you wish as long as it is high enough quality for our
printers.  I looked around and saw there were no stores or sites
focused on decorations for wall tents helping to create a home in the
wilderness. A Freeman Tent comes with lots of places to hang
decorations or items such as bow racks, gun racks or places to dry
clothes.</span></div><div>

Zippers, Ropes and Tensioners, Stakes, Rolls of Screen, Stove Jack

This will give us the ability to start production and get a head of

<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why Tents?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The world is full of conveniences. Some
are great! While convenience can be great it can also make us
dependent on the system of convenience.  If you don't exercise those
muscles they may not be there when you need them. The tents are the
vehicle in which we give families a way to unplug. A shelter that
feels like home.         There is nothing like waking up to the sounds of
nature. Our wood stoves make it nice and cozy inside during cold
weather. The tents have so many functions other than camping. They
can be set up in the yard for a special dinner with friends, set up
at a park for a family reunion. A popular use is to build a wood
structure ( Porch) for the tent on land you want to build on or that
you own off grid and want to spend time on.  Live in the tent while
you choose the perfect spot to build!</span>

foundation and production is perfect before we start anything new.  
We want our customer satisfaction and customer referral to surpass
excellence. Once we have that we will start to develop more tent
designs. With hundreds of tents used throughout history this keep us
busy for a long time.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I am actively seeking the location now for our
outdoor learning center. Which will serve the online community and
the off grid community. We will offer survival, cooking, canning,
preserving, foraging, oils and permaculture classes. This is going to be a
school of wilderness learning. Much like the school I completed my
Wilderness First Responder Training. It will also be an outreach
center creating jobs, growing food and teaching skills for a
successful life to our youth. We will reach out to the homeless or
anyone who have seen hard times and give them work to get back on
their feet.</span></div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The tents are only the beginning to
what will become an empire of outdoor knowledge and application. We
look forward to meeting all of our contributors at a class one day!</span></div>

</div> </div>","Meet Russell Freeman

I am Russell
Freeman, a Chef, Wilderness First Responder, owner of Freeman Tents
and outdoor enthusiast. I grew up on a farm, learning the old ways
of my grandparents who grew up during the Great Depression.  I was in the fields before I could
go to school. I have realized the importance of
preserving the fleeting knowledge of homesteading.  It is this
pursuit to preserve that  knowledge that has lead me to start
Freeman Tents and Outdoor Supplies. Who in the very near future will
be opening a Primitive Learning Center.  Freeman Tents manufactures
and distributes Canvas Wall Tents, Wood Stoves and is a one stop shop
for all your camping needs. 

I worked for the United States Antarctic Program for 7 years.  During
that time I trained to use many skills for cold weather
survival and rescue.  Glacial Search and Rescue (GSAR), Crevasse
Rescue, Zodiac Rescue, Whiteout survival, CPR, First Responder, a
member of the Fire Team and Mass Causality Incident protocols.
Spending months living in a tent at the West Antarctic Ice Sheet camp
(WAIS Divide).  Supporting projects such as Whillans Ice Stream
Subglacial Access Research Drilling (WISSARD), ANtarctic Geological
Drilling (ANDRILL), and WAIS. 

I spent winters on the ice as well summers perfecting cold weather
survival skills. Ending my run on the ice in 2013 to start a company
that will supply and educate people to live and survive in the
wilderness.  


I need your help in reaching the world! Freeman Tents was started for so many reasons. One of those reasons was to bring people home. We have forgotten and in some cases afraid of the world we call the “wilderness”. It has become a place only the brave dare to explore. We have created products and paired products to make the transition back to the great outdoors as convenient and simple as possible. We are a learning center teaching skills to live in a forgotten world. We offer knowledge, honesty, integrity and passion as our business model. We will never stop in our mission to offer the best of the best. Freeman Tents is not just a company it is a lifestyle. We love the outdoors and strive to be one with it again.

I have spent the last two years in research and development.  I used my own money to build a prototype tent. We are using your contributions to move our prototype into the manufacturing phase. I need your help to do that! Thank you so much! Any amount is appreciated. Who We Are, Where We Are, Where We Need To Go

Who We AreAt first glance Freeman Tents is a
canvas wall tent and outdoor supply company. When you look deeper you
will see that is just the beginning of what will become a wilderness
survival learning center.  A company that will give back as much as
it receives.  We are a one stop shop for all your camps needs.  It is
our goal and dream to not only give you the equipment but also the
knowledge and skill set to live in nature very comfortably.  People
have been living in tents for thousands of years, some still do. 

We
have big goals and big dreams to preserve the old ways being lost to
convenience. Growing up on my grandparents farm I see how important
the information is that could easily be lost in a generation. The
fact that “homesteading” is being taught in colleges today
confirms these ways of life are becoming history quickly. We are
dedicated to sharing the joys to nature with the whole world,
starting with your family!Where Are We NowWe have spent two years researching
and developing our canvas wall tents and connecting with suppliers
for our online outdoors store. We offer wood stoves in complete
packages, meaning it is fully functional right out of the box and
made in America! Canvas wall tents will last 30 years if you take proper care of them. So you can pass this tent on the net generation of campers! 
They are made from: 10.10 oz ARMY DUCK 60"" Wide Cotton Duck /Sunforger®- Marine Boat Shrunk - Fire Retardant Tent Canvas Fabric - Natural ColorStandard Features Include:Stove Jack: your choice of 4"", 5"", 6""
Sod Cloth: 10” Vinyl sewn around the bottom inside of the tent.
This can be covered with dirt “sod” or sand bags creating a
weather seal.


Ridge Pole Sleeves: These are openings at the top of the tent
front and back to extend the ridge poles for awnings.  They are wide enough to set up an A-frame style ridge line. You can use logs as the ridge line support. Lots of resorts that have tents for glamping use this style, it looks incredible. You can also use a rope and traditionals poles. You have options when it comes to frames. You can also ask for eave sleeves to be added giving you a much easier way to add the awning to your tent. 
Ropes and Tensioners: We provide ropes and metal tensioners. 

Steel Stakes: 12” are for the ropes and 10” for around the
tent. 

5' Walls: Walls come standard at 5'. You can choose to have them
6'.  
Each tent comes in a bag. It is recommended that you store the
tent in a rubber bin of some sort. If you cook in the tent it will have
residue from cooking and may attract mice which would eat through the
bag and ruin your tent with holes. The bag is for easy transport. The
tent should always be COMPLETELY dry before packing it away. 

Webbing is sewn in around the bottom of the tent for strength. We
use heavy duty grommets on the bottom and across the eaves for
staking the tent to the ground and  anchoring it with guy lines. 
Many more features can be added when you build your tent. 
By offering digitally printed fire retardant
banners I have created ways to help decorate your tent. You can print
any image you wish as long as it is high enough quality for our
printers.  I looked around and saw there were no stores or sites
focused on decorations for wall tents helping to create a home in the
wilderness. A Freeman Tent comes with lots of places to hang
decorations or items such as bow racks, gun racks or places to dry
clothes.
The prototype and patterns are made
and ready for production. Our manufacturing partner has over 50 years
experience in the sewing industry making us confident in our ability
to mass produce our tents with supreme quality.  A North Carolina
based company. We are set to make the jump into production in as
little as a few days once we reach our goal! With two years of
planning everything is cued up and ready to roll! We just need your
help.Where We Need To GoWe need help moving into the
manufacturing phase. We need a few additional pieces of equipment and
 parts to update some equipment we have already.  We need to purchase
materials in bulk to the quantity that will allow the lowest prices
in order to pass that low price on to you. We need Canvas, Webbing,
Zippers, Ropes and Tensioners, Stakes, Rolls of Screen, Stove Jack
Material and Rolls of Poly material to make our rainflys all in bulk.
This will give us the ability to start production and get a head of
the supply demands.
Our wood stoves are handmade here in
America! They need to be to be purchased in bulk as well.Our website is up and functional to
take pre orders now!! We have much more web work to be done though. We have
30K products to add to our online store! As I said we will be a one
stop shop for everything you need!
The website will include our outdoor
supply store, instructional video, tips, tricks and skills for off
grid living.  We have lots of products to add to the online store
which takes lots of time and money. To achieve this we are releasing
one thousand products each month.A breakdown of where your contributions go. Updating Equipment and purchasing new =
$700Bulk Materials = $7000
 
















Canvas = $2385Screen = $616Poly = $1000Stakes & Tensioners = $1000Webbing, Rope, Zippers, Hardware,
	Stove Jack Material = $1999Stoves = $1000Website Work = $900Miscellaneous in case market prices
rise or we missed something = $500


Why Tents?The world is full of conveniences. Some
are great! While convenience can be great it can also make us
dependent on the system of convenience.  If you don't exercise those
muscles they may not be there when you need them. The tents are the
vehicle in which we give families a way to unplug. A shelter that
feels like home.         There is nothing like waking up to the sounds of
nature. Our wood stoves make it nice and cozy inside during cold
weather. The tents have so many functions other than camping. They
can be set up in the yard for a special dinner with friends, set up
at a park for a family reunion. A popular use is to build a wood
structure ( Porch) for the tent on land you want to build on or that
you own off grid and want to spend time on.  Live in the tent while
you choose the perfect spot to build!


What's NextFirst we will be sure we have a solid
foundation and production is perfect before we start anything new.  
We want our customer satisfaction and customer referral to surpass
excellence. Once we have that we will start to develop more tent
designs. With hundreds of tents used throughout history this keep us
busy for a long time.

I am actively seeking the location now for our
outdoor learning center. Which will serve the online community and
the off grid community. We will offer survival, cooking, canning,
preserving, foraging, oils and permaculture classes. This is going to be a
school of wilderness learning. Much like the school I completed my
Wilderness First Responder Training. It will also be an outreach
center creating jobs, growing food and teaching skills for a
successful life to our youth. We will reach out to the homeless or
anyone who have seen hard times and give them work to get back on
their feet.
The tents are only the beginning to
what will become an empire of outdoor knowledge and application. We
look forward to meeting all of our contributors at a class one day!

Thank you so much!  Perks and RewardsNow for the fun stuff!!

$4000 A Freeman Tent, An Outfitter Stove Package and Me!!!! The Impact You Help Us MakeMy dream is to teach the world to feel comfortable in the wilderness. Even if that is just a few miles from home in a park. I teamed up with a teardrop trailer company to give the family, living in a suburban neighborhood options. Even if they drive a small economy car we can still get them a tent and camping! These teardrop trailers can be pulled by small cars. No need for a big truck. You can pack our tent and poles in this trailer along with all your camping equipment and still have every seat for available for the family! I really tried to think of everyone!   


I worked as the Executive Chef of a research station in the most remote place on the planet. That logistical nightmare that we make look so easy has more than prepared and qualified me to run this company. I am not one to go out without a fight hahahaha. I work hard and never give up.  By contributing to us you are helping to preserve the knowledge that could so easily be lost soon.  I am going to teach children where food really comes from.  If you have ever worked for a corporation you have probably been to a ""team building weekend."" How many families have team building weekends? Is this not the best team you have? Maybe you don't have a family and you want to come join ours by taking some survival classes with us. There is so much to be learned by teaching primitive living. I have taken the lessons i learned on the farm with me my whole life. They have served me well. I want to pass that on to others. I want to see the lights come on when people find a place in the outdoors they feel comfortable and be at peace.  

When you contribute to this company you have my word we are always going to stay with our motto "" Making peoples lives better.""  Everything we do will based off that statement.  Does it make peoples lives better?  I thank you so much for reading everything I wrote to you here. I wish you could hear my words of sincerity.  Feel free to contact us anytime with questions about our company.  This is just the beginning. What you contribute to today will last for decades to come and impact the world with knowledge, passion and love of the wonderful outdoors.  
Risks & Challenges

There are always risks in life. Especially when you step out and start a small business. We face the same risks every company does with everyday job market and economy factors.  

I believe in being proactive and not reactive. That is why I know that two years of planning have been well worth it! I have spent so many nights going to bed thinking of challenges and waking up thinking of how to solve them. These designs have been around for thousands of years so there is no worries about if they are tested. The material we use is the best you can get in todays market. Our sewers have 50 years experience.  We have spent lots of hours in the shop getting to know this product.  Looking at the market people are already buying these tents and have been for decades. 

We have been promoting and building support for a year by going to conferences and speaking at events telling everyone I could talk to about Freeman Tents. I have surveyed people all over the country. Asking what they want and why.  These surveys over the past year have influenced what you are seeing today.    


The two years were also spent researching social media marketing and the pros/cons of marketing companies. This company will be active in the social groups online and off. We will stay in touch with the world by blogging, instructional videos and speaking events.  I have endorsements from some very popular people that will be out soon as well.  


I have set up a wide range of revenue builders. With our online store, survival classes, glamping decor and tents we have diversified our revenue and keep it steady.

<p>That's how our Project
Showroom started. <br/>
Showroom will be an international platform for artists of any kind. Artists
will be able to upload their work, create a profile which will be linked to
every upload of them, get feedback by people who are actually interested in
what they're doing and even find projects or other artists to work together
with and in the best case: create something big!</p>
<p>We want to remove regional

with a degree. If you're an artists, someone who likes/loves art or if you are
looking for an artists to work with, you can find it on Showroom!</p>
<p>There are a lot(!!!) of
artists out in this world, that you may have seen once or twice in your
Facebook feed, by searching for a wallpaper or by just randomly strolling
around the internet. But have you ever wondered who the artist actually is? If
they have other work you would maybe appreciate? Or even have a wish you would
love your new favorite artist to work on? We did! That is why we wanted to
create this Project and upon up the huge world of art to everyone!</p>
<p>So why we are on Indiegogo
you might ask and here is why: We are two students who work jobs next to their
studies to afford a living. But every minute we find ourselves to be free is
being used to improve our vision of Showroom. We have reached a lot in the 1
1/2 years we have been working on Showroom and are now at the point where it is
all about programming. </p>
<p>We have maxed out all our
available resources to finish the structure of the website, planning future
projects such as sponsoring projects for artists, the blueprints for the layout
and important aspects such as usability and intuitivity.</p>
<p>So to finally have Project
Showroom come to life, we need resources to find talented programmers since we
need more than one to build a website of this scale and finally give all the
artists that are screaming for this kind of platform (since every artists we
asked about their opinion on our Project were purely positive).</p>
<p>Side note: We are already
running a project with artist who are working with us for free and in exchange
they have the ability to work freely on a project in order to have that project

be using as our main marketing object, since it will be using the synergy of
every artist and their expertise. And in exchange for their creative and hard
work, we offer them to be our first faces of Showroom. We have planned a lot of other projects for artists in the future so stay tuned!<br/></p>

</div></div>","WHAT IS CLOSEUP NYCCloseUp is an artist collective that cultivates projects. Our mission is bringing artists together and giving them the tools to realize their creations. CloseUp is a collaborative group of theater and film artists. We work together as a team to foster a learning environment and create compelling productions. At CloseUp we create both film and theatrical opportunities for and with our artists, and invite the public and industry to share work.                                                                                                                                                               Our artists must always flex their creative muscle. Whether it is in a intensive class, production, screening or showcase with audience feedback our artists will have multiple avenues to forever develop. We already have a ton of events and projects lined up and we need your help to secure a home for NYC's new rising talent. Please join us on our quest and become a part of the CloseUp community.WHY WE NEED $$$We have an awesome team of employees, strong dedicated instructors,  production equipment, workshops and classes. The only thing missing is...yep you guessed it: a home. We are looking for a venue to house our members, workshops, events, and the company's equipment. Our goal is to raise $55,000 for a secure location in New York City and have a down payment ready to go for the landowner.We are creating a haven here at Closeup, and to do that, we need a location.





With a new location, we plan to host the following: 
-Company and networking events
-All day workshops intensives
-Dance classes
-Photo shoots
-Business classes
-Active panels with experienced acting teachers, directors and producers
-Our seasonal film festival
We would also use the intimate studio for actors rehearsals, auditions, plays and more. 




Here at CloseUp, we want nothing more than to be able to provide and share our acting, business, workshops and coaching skills to our extended entertainment family. 
If we don't get our long desired studio:
-We would be renting a lot of different places for our workshops and events ( which may annoy or drive away away members) 
-We would have to rent equipment since we wouldn't  have a space to permanently store it
-We wouldn't be able to provide a stable safe place actors could call home 

We hope to get more. If we do, we would be able to pay a full year for the retail space.
We would also be able to use the money to: 
-Pay staff
-Decorate the space
-Piano for lively music during workshops 
-Film equipment to rent to filmmakers


WHAT IS IN IT FOR YOU
We definitely appreciate all the help we can get. Of course, when you make a generous contribution, you will get a gift: headshots, free workshops, VIP access to events, and even the possibility of owning a percentage of the company.

<h1>Why are we crowdfunding?</h1>
<p>Because as investors ourselves we believe in our crowd.  Our founder @scottwhaley is passionate about this project.  So passionate in fact that he has already provided the initial seed investment to the tune of $200,000+.  @scottwhaley has provided the funds for the basic build-out of FundingFinder.  But what we need now is you.  Active participation of independent investors like yourself in the REIFA &amp; FundingFinder platform will be the key to our success.</p>
<p>FundingFinder build-out is already underway; we are currently 40% complete.  Your contributions and participation as REIFA members are what is going to make this project a success!</p>
<p>We are crowdfunding because we are determined to make FundingFinder at the most basic level available to as many investors as possible. This application is built for independent investors like  you and me.  At REIFA we believe that disrupting the barriers of separation between borrowers and lenders and investors is the best way to open up access, lower costs and create access to opportunity for all.  Old technology and their believers are quickly becoming obstacles and costly in terms of time, effort and dollars!</p>
<p>We also believe, no one can do it all alone.  Only a community can handle and process the expense and time it takes to handle the flood of data and speed of change we live in today.  For the crowd, it's easy.</p>
<p>We love the crowdfund movement.  We love how it empowers people, leverages our time, money and energy.  It makes the individual more powerful and profitable simply by choosing to work with a crowd instead of on their own.  With your donation, you will ensure that connections and access to Real Estate Investment Funding will be available for yourself and your community. </p>

<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>With a web application and association membership of this size, the biggest challenge is for us to meet our launch window and thereby engage and retain members immediately.  We feel the risk of member non-engagement is low.  Our market research shows that there is a unnecessary level of difficulty for investors to locate REI funding, and for lenders to reach new customers easily.  As of today FundingFinder is 40% complete, we are currently looking at a beta program launch of late April 2016.  Delays are to be expected as in any project of this type and have been included in our estimated launch date.  <br/><br/>We expect functionality to be basic at launch and more advanced features will be added overtime.  As membership in REIFA grows, we will be able to negotiate more/better benefits for our members from even larger vendors nationwide.  Some member benefits may be rolled out over time.<br/><br/>Our team here at REIFA is comprised of industry professionals, who have experience in managing real estate membership associations of this kind.<br/><br/><br/>

FundingFinder is a web-based application that matches real estate investors with real estate lenders.  Much like Match.com or AirBnB, it is specialized just for you...And it has never been done before.FundingFinder has the largest and fastest growing directory of private and alternative funding providers for real estate investors on the planet.  It runs an algorithm,  then pairs you with the perfect match,  whether you are an investor or a lender. In association with NationalREIA,  FundingFinder not only provides you with a huge database of investors and lenders,  but it provides you community.  Your application comes with a membership to our association,  an association that complements the application by creating opportunities for face-to-face meet-ups. This association is the Real Estate Investors Funding Association or ""REIFA"" for short.Our Goal-- We aim to unveil the beta version of FundingFinder at our next face-to-face opportunity, REIFACON, happening from April 27-30th, 2016, in Los Angeles, CA.For Borrowers, it is a way to replace old legacy systems with technological advances. Your choice and options are infinitely greater,  and the speed of execution goes from days or
weeks to minutes.  Essentially,  it saves you both time and money,  while keeping you up-to-date in your field.  Or,  as we like to say, ""Better, faster, more"".  For Lenders it is a way to see more deals,  higher quality deals, better matched deals.  Eliminating so much of the time spent in marketing and working with unsophisticated or untrained investors who waste your time with deals that are unsuitable for you.   How Does it Work?
REI FundingFinder has 25 matching criteria for users to choose from.  The borrowers and lenders select as few or as many of the criteria that are important to them.  
Some of the current criteria are personal in nature, such as:


Credit score
Criminal background check
Number of deals done

While others are financially oriented, such as:


LTV
Purchase price
Amount of downpayment
Term of the requested loan

Yet, still more, are property centric, such as:


Number of bedrooms
Age of the property
REI property condition
Geographical area


Investors:

Enter your deal information: location, LTV, desired loan type/terms, etc.
FundingFinder gives you (the borrower) the best matches using yours and the lenders criteria.   
Get the deal done!  (We put you in direct contact with lenders and you pick and choose from those best matches, unlike other sites where the lenders are in control)

Lenders:

Enter your lending criteria information chosen from the list of 25 that are important to you.   
FundingFinder stores that information and then applies your lending criteria against all funding requests made by borrowers.  Any borrower whose request for funding matches your lending criteria is then considered a ""match"" and the borrower is made aware of you and the match.  

Borrowers you are matched with will see who they are matched with and can send their request for funding directly and electronically to 1, 2 or all 3 matched lenders at once.

We are crowdfunding because we are determined to make FundingFinder at the most basic level available to as many investors as possible. This application is built for independent investors like  you and me.  At REIFA we believe that disrupting the barriers of separation between borrowers and lenders and investors is the best way to open up access, lower costs and create access to opportunity for all.  Old technology and their believers are quickly becoming obstacles and costly in terms of time, effort and dollars!
We also believe, no one can do it all alone.  Only a community can handle and process the expense and time it takes to handle the flood of data and speed of change we live in today.  For the crowd, it's easy.

<h3>Fairbanks Open Radio<br/>
</h3>
<p>In
        this time of rapid global change, both physical and cultural,
        serious dialogue
        and action are required of us all. But in order to facilitate the dynamic, independent exchange of ideas that we need to understand our changing world, we need a dynamic and independent forum. With your help, together we can build that forum:  KWRK-LP 90.9 FM Fairbanks Open Radio!</p>
<p>Despite tremendous
        corporate media
        influence and legislative restrictions that have limited the growth of community radio stations, the enactment of the
        Local Community
        Radio Act of 2011 forced the FCC to provide a <i>one-time opportunity</i> for 1000 new low-power
        noncommercial radio
        licenses to be granted across the country. 
        The application process opened briefly in the fall of
        2013, and
        Fairbanks Open Radio jumped at the chance to bring independent,        locally produced radio
        to the Fairbanks
        area. <br/></p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p>The Alaska Peace Center and FOR
        were granted a
        construction permit to build and operate a noncommercial,
        educational, low
        power FM radio station. The
        100-watt FM signal will reach a radius of roughly five miles
        from the
        intersection of College and University. Programming
        will soon be streamed online at <a href=""http://www.kwrk.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">kwrk.org</a>. </p>
<p>What we need now is your help to get KWRK-LP off the ground  and on the air! With your support, KWRK-LP 90.9 FM could be broadcasting by summer 2015!</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>To grow this station from the grassroots, we need equipment. With the help of the Prometheus Radio Project, FOR has outlined a detailed budget with a reasonable timeline to get the station up and running. In general terms...<br/></p> <ul>
<li>1/3 of proceeds will go to the transmission budget (antenna, transmitter, etc), and</li>
<li>2/3 will go to studio equipment and operational costs (music licensing, utilities, etc).<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <p>As a backer, you get LPFM radio shout outs, KWRK-y handmade paraphernalia, and BEST OF ALL: satisfaction in knowing that you helped <span style="""">democratize the Fairbanks airwaves!</span></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Programming
</h3>
<p>FOR will broadcast open, interactive
        radio content
        that emphasizes issues relevant to Fairbanks, Interior Alaska,
        and the
        circumpolar north, as well as the local impacts of global
        events. KWRK-LP
        will promote diversity,
        sustainability, localism, and environmental awareness in a
        circumpolar setting.
        This will include: 
    
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>locally produced music and drama</li>
<li>interviews with living legends of northern history</li>
<li>children’s shows</li>
<li>book readings</li>
<li>philosophical inquiries<br/>
</li>
<li>news and news analysis</li>
<li>and more...</li>
</ul>
<p>FOR
        will also broadcast nationally syndicated programs not readily
        available
        elsewhere on the local dial, from sources like Pacifica, Project Censored, and
        others. <br/></p>
<br/>

</div></div>","Fairbanks Open Radio

In
        this time of rapid global change, both physical and cultural,
        serious dialogue
        and action are required of us all. But in order to facilitate the dynamic, independent exchange of ideas that we need to understand our changing world, we need a dynamic and independent forum. With your help, together we can build that forum:  KWRK-LP 90.9 FM Fairbanks Open Radio!
Despite tremendous
        corporate media
        influence and legislative restrictions that have limited the growth of community radio stations, the enactment of the
        Local Community
        Radio Act of 2011 forced the FCC to provide a one-time opportunity for 1000 new low-power
        noncommercial radio
        licenses to be granted across the country. 
        The application process opened briefly in the fall of
        2013, and
        Fairbanks Open Radio jumped at the chance to bring independent,        locally produced radio
        to the Fairbanks
        area. 

The Alaska Peace Center and FOR
        were granted a
        construction permit to build and operate a noncommercial,
        educational, low
        power FM radio station. The
        100-watt FM signal will reach a radius of roughly five miles
        from the
        intersection of College and University. Programming
        will soon be streamed online at kwrk.org. 
What we need now is your help to get KWRK-LP off the ground  and on the air! With your support, KWRK-LP 90.9 FM could be broadcasting by summer 2015!



What We Need & What You Get To grow this station from the grassroots, we need equipment. With the help of the Prometheus Radio Project, FOR has outlined a detailed budget with a reasonable timeline to get the station up and running. In general terms... 
1/3 of proceeds will go to the transmission budget (antenna, transmitter, etc), and
2/3 will go to studio equipment and operational costs (music licensing, utilities, etc).
    As a backer, you get LPFM radio shout outs, KWRK-y handmade paraphernalia, and BEST OF ALL: satisfaction in knowing that you helped democratize the Fairbanks airwaves!

Programming

FOR will broadcast open, interactive
        radio content
        that emphasizes issues relevant to Fairbanks, Interior Alaska,
        and the
        circumpolar north, as well as the local impacts of global
        events. KWRK-LP
        will promote diversity,
        sustainability, localism, and environmental awareness in a
        circumpolar setting.
        This will include: 
    
    


locally produced music and drama
interviews with living legends of northern history
children’s shows
book readings
philosophical inquiries

news and news analysis
and more...

FOR
        will also broadcast nationally syndicated programs not readily
        available
        elsewhere on the local dial, from sources like Pacifica, Project Censored, and
        others. 

Here is a short KWRK-LP radio mashup, featuring local music by ""Kale"" and interviews by Birch Pavelsky, David Koester and Flyn Ludington: 
 






The People's Radio StationFOR is a
        grassroots organization, and KWRK-LP will be entirely
        independent, listener-built and listener-supported. Therefore, donations from large
        corporations or
        foundations will not be accepted. This is why your contribution is so important!KWRK-LP
        will give voice to the underrepresented members of our community
        such as:

Elders and Youth
LGBTQs
Alaska Natives
Poor and homeless
Students
Veterans

Incarcerated persons, past and present
Peace activists and other social and environmental
        justice
        advocates
The rest of Alaska's working class

  
Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute money, perhaps you have some time, audio content, or equipment to spare. FOR is looking for:  DJs
Talk show hosts

Sound engineers
Web designers

Fundraisers
Audio collectors
Book readers

Event coordinators
Journalists
Rabble rousers
Local music
Studio equipment
Office supplies


We meet every Wednesday at 5pm in the studio (3535 College Rd, Suite 203, Fairbanks, AK 99709).

<p>So we taped a note to the wall of our bar AMDO, offering 12% interest on loans to startup the new brewery.  We got $80,000 ( ~200,000 in todays dollars) to start the place up.  Guess they call that Crowdsourcing now... back then we called it ""You Guys Rock!!!"" </p>

</div></div>","Bardo on the Riverfront

Same old Bardo fun... now on 2 acres of Riverfront property! 100,000 sq ft of BeerDisneyLand!
Biggest Dog Park in the city!
 Anacostia River Trail goes THROUGH the property.  

No Porta-Potties!ll Flush Toilets. 
Shiny Stainless Steel Brewery Tanks!
Outdoor movies, as always... this time projected onto a floating screen in the river! 
Bicycle parking for 500 bikes!! 

Cornhole. Food Trucks.  Bike Shop on site.  The return of the famous Bardo Sandbox for the kiddies.  Square Dances! Bluegrassapalooza.  Kayak ramp. Cool River breezes. A little bit of the country right in the middle of the city. 
   We Need $200K to do this thing deluxe, and you get the best price on beer on the Riverfront.   We have enough money to do a bare bones setup. But folks like real toilets! so we are gonna spend the extra money on custom made real flush bathrooms.  A 25 BBL brewery too. Along with a Bike Shop.  Kiddie playground. And the Largest Dog Park in DC.  10,000 sq ft of canine fun.  With your help.  Get the best price on beer in the stadium area! $9.50 for Sierra Nevada in the ball park? NO! $8 for a can of Boddingtons at the Fairgrounds? NO! $7 for a beer at Bluejacket.??  
$5 for a Pint at Bardo!!  Yessir, if you buy that beer now, thats the price you pay.  Buy as many as you like.  Your whole rugby team wants to drink $5 beers?  Buy a fistful!
Last time we opened with Porta-potties, and we heard you loud and clear. Get rid of those and give us real toilets! So we are gonna do that...  before we open this time.  
Help make this the only park in DC where you can walk around with a drink in your hand legally! And your dog can run around off leash legally! While your kiddies play in the sandbox.  While your bike gets tuned up. 
Make this construction site parking lot into a Park we all can enjoy! Buy Beer Now, Drink it this summer. 
Return of the Marion Berry Malt Liquor shirt. 'Nuff said!!     In the Olden Days (Before Al Gore Invented the Internet)  Back in 1993, we were trying to open up Bardo Arlington. And of course banks would never take a risk on something like the first brewpub in Virginia... ( Banker ""Do you have 2 years of profitability to show us?"" ... We said  ""If we were open for 2 years, we wouldn't need Bank money!"")
So we taped a note to the wall of our bar AMDO, offering 12% interest on loans to startup the new brewery.  We got $80,000 ( ~200,000 in todays dollars) to start the place up.  Guess they call that Crowdsourcing now... back then we called it ""You Guys Rock!!!"" 
This will be the 8th project we have done, and looks to be the best!! Like the Bardo Farm comes to the city!!   Get that Bonfire goin! 

    Other Ways You Can Help If you got no dinero, thats okay too... we need help in other ways... 

We need someone to take the spent grain and feed it to their animals. Contact us for more details.
Need some wood chips too, so if you know where we can get some, drop us a line!
Also need some big tree logs to make into totem poles.  Got a tree being taken down on your property?  Work for a tree Surgeon?  Get in touch.
Run an arts organization that can program the sculpture park?  Contact us.
Get the word out and make some noise about the new Bardo Riverfront.

Let’s think about this for a minute. There are 35,879 cities, villages and townships in the United States and over 96 percent of these communities have less than 25,000 residents. 49 percent have less than 1,000.</p><p>Local governments like these often rely on volunteers for assistance achieving public goals. In fact, there are over 5 million volunteers who serve on boards and commissions throughout the United States. These boards and commissions, such as the local planning commission or zoning board of appeals, have a lot of power when it comes to shaping our communities. If you try to look up these boards and commissions online however, chances are you’ll have a difficult time finding any information. This barrier to information often means that volunteers aren’t necessarily representative of the community. For example, young people (18-35) account for 29% of registered voters in metro Detroit, but only 6% of board and commission members.</p><p>It’s not that local governments are intentionally exclusionary, but rather that getting all of this information on the web and managing the databases takes a lot of time and money. We at the Metro Matters, a 501(c)3 nonprofit in metro Detroit, hope to change this with On Board. For local officials, On Board is a secure database they can use to more easily manage information about boards and commissions. For residents like you and me, it’s a website we can use to find information about our local government and get involved.</p><p><i>“The City of Ferndale is very excited to be selected to participate in the On Board pilot program.

Atticus Smith has truly been life changing for me, especially in what now know
to be possible. Being an athlete of "" smaller stature,” certain
phrases were all too familiar when it came to my strength and lifting. ""You
are just too small…you will never be able to lift heavy unless you gain weight…you
are not the right build for weightlifting."" Or my favorite, ""Stick to
what you are good at: running or bodyweight movements."" While running
and body movements such as pull-ups and muscle-ups came quite easily to me,
lifting heavy did not! However, I can still remember the first time I ever felt
a barbell in my hands—I guess you could say it was "" love at first
touch.""  But time and time again I became discouraged when I got
stuck at a particular lift, especially when lifting next to a girl who
outweighed me by 20+ pounds continued to improve her numbers!</i></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><i></i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433123394/k6c9pd75xono56wtphns.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><i>As a lifelong athlete,
I have tried my fair share of strength and lifting programs. I also have had
numerous coaches and trainers from all different walks of life and backgrounds.
And while I have learned from each and every one, I truly have never seen or felt
the results as those I’ve experienced since starting my training with Atticus.</i></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><i></i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433123450/eexb42dhxpj8o6akmhi9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><i> At 40 years old
I can truly say that I am stronger and in better shape than I ever have been in
my entire life! Atticus has taught me that if you train smart and correctly, results

has helped me turn my weaknesses into strengths. My body is indeed capable—I
can now do things I once believed to be impossible. </i></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><i></i></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433123689/ihp5gcrluczqyozeqb9j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><i>Training his way,

pushes me to places that I never have been before, but when I'm done training

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in;""><b><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt;"">From
the Editor: Origin Story</span></b></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in;"">My story begins several years ago when I, a lifelong
beanpole, was trying to pack on lean muscle. I was drowning in protein shakes
and egg whites. Three years and 60 pounds later I reviewed my logbook, smugly
impressed by how far I’d come. I was bench pressing 260 and deadlifting 380 to
the wide-eyed wonderment of my fellow gym attendees. I was strong! </p>
</div>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Or so I thought.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">One day I saw a video online featuring my brother—sporting
nearly a buck sixty body weight—training with powerlifters in Ohio. I easily
outweighed him by 40 pounds, yet here he was deadlifting 500 pounds like it was
a feather pillow! More than I could lift even once on my best day, he was
lifting massive weights multiple times in succession without even breaking a
sweat!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Seeing him lift so much so easily was a much-needed reality
check to my ego. I realized I needed better training and expertise beyond
dotcom fitness forums. I moved 2,000 miles across the country to join my brother
to train with giants, surrounded by some of the strongest men and women on the
planet.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">And now that we've returned we want to pay it forward by
providing a space for specialized strength training in Cache Valley for the
rest of the Mountain West region! </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt;"">The
Vision</span></b><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt;""></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">We started Blacksmith Barbell with a singular mission: to
produce top-tier athletes in a world-class strength facility. This region has a
deep well of untapped potential. There are so many talented, hardworking people
in the area with the ability and drive to become Olympians, champion fighters,
collegiate/professional athletes, and legendary lifters. Our goal is to
complete the equation by providing knowledgeable strength training experience;
we want athletes from all over the Wild West draped in gold medals and standing
on the world's tallest podiums.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt;"">We
Can't Do This Without You</span></b><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt;""></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The truth is you won't get strong on a treadmill. A gym
that forges elite athletes needs weight. Lots of it! Making individuals or
teams strong requires hefty pounds, and pounds cost pounds (or
dollars). We have the building, now we need your help to transform
it. </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">We are raising funds primarily for necessary building
improvements. Our greatest goal is to raise the money needed to open the
doors of our facility as soon as possible. Timing is the most critical factor
for our high school and college athletes hoping to develop the skills and power
necessary to win scholarships and catch the eye of recruiting scouts for
professional camp invitations while they’re still of age.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b> </b></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">In the event that we reach our goal, any surplus funds
raised will go directly toward equipment including: high quality bars that
won’t bend when our athletes start bench pressing 600 pounds; plates and
dumbbells big enough to intimidate Clydesdales; and machines that our trainees
will love to hate. We can’t make the journey alone. We need you!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b> </b></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">In the event that we don’t raise the funds necessary to
purchase the minimum amount of equipment right from day one, then let us thank
you and assure you that your contributions will be piled in with any amount of
loans, savings, treasure maps, livestock barters, Girl Scout cookie sales,
diamond heists, and alchemy necessary to fund this adventure—it’s not a matter
of if, but when!</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt;"">Impact</span></b><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt;""></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">We’re going to put Cache Valley on the map as <i>the</i>
location for high-level strength training and powerlifting. We want Logan to
dominate Utah’s record books. We want local businesses to flourish from the
crowds we attract, and we want to provide opportunities for students and
athletes.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">And we’re already on our way! We have several athletes
contending for new world records within the next two years, and with the proper
training, instruction, and sufficient weight to challenge their abilities,
success is within reach!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Much planning and input has been taken into consideration
to provide donors with valuable and usable rewards for their support. Thanks to
everyone for your help and feedback along the way! Reaching the starting line
is the biggest hurdle, so any contribution you can make is greatly appreciated,
whether it’s $1 or $10,000.  This Cache Valley legacy that we build will
be one that the greater Rocky Mountain region can be proud of and rally around;
everything starts and ends by working together with the desire to create
something spectacular!</p>

to be possible. Being an athlete of "" smaller stature,” certain
phrases were all too familiar when it came to my strength and lifting. ""You
are just too small…you will never be able to lift heavy unless you gain weight…you
are not the right build for weightlifting."" Or my favorite, ""Stick to
what you are good at: running or bodyweight movements."" While running
and body movements such as pull-ups and muscle-ups came quite easily to me,
lifting heavy did not! However, I can still remember the first time I ever felt
a barbell in my hands—I guess you could say it was "" love at first
touch.""  But time and time again I became discouraged when I got
stuck at a particular lift, especially when lifting next to a girl who
outweighed me by 20+ pounds continued to improve her numbers!
As a lifelong athlete,
I have tried my fair share of strength and lifting programs. I also have had
numerous coaches and trainers from all different walks of life and backgrounds.
And while I have learned from each and every one, I truly have never seen or felt
the results as those I’ve experienced since starting my training with Atticus.
 At 40 years old
I can truly say that I am stronger and in better shape than I ever have been in
my entire life! Atticus has taught me that if you train smart and correctly, results
will come no matter your age. He has shown me what my training was lacking and
has helped me turn my weaknesses into strengths. My body is indeed capable—I
can now do things I once believed to be impossible. Training his way,
like a powerlifter, is NOT easy!  It takes time and much dedication. And
heck, I honestly can say that I have even shed a few tears! Sometimes it hurts,
but only in good ways—I have never been injured since training with Atticus. He
pushes me to places that I never have been before, but when I'm done training
and my session is over I'm not only physically stronger but I'm mentally
stronger as well.
I know now that if
you train HARD, train RIGHT, and train SMART, size really doesn’t matter;
even little girls can lift heavy things! Thank you, Atticus!!!

 
From
the Editor: Origin Story
My story begins several years ago when I, a lifelong
beanpole, was trying to pack on lean muscle. I was drowning in protein shakes
and egg whites. Three years and 60 pounds later I reviewed my logbook, smugly
impressed by how far I’d come. I was bench pressing 260 and deadlifting 380 to
the wide-eyed wonderment of my fellow gym attendees. I was strong! 

 
Or so I thought.
 
One day I saw a video online featuring my brother—sporting
nearly a buck sixty body weight—training with powerlifters in Ohio. I easily
outweighed him by 40 pounds, yet here he was deadlifting 500 pounds like it was
a feather pillow! More than I could lift even once on my best day, he was
lifting massive weights multiple times in succession without even breaking a
sweat!
 
Seeing him lift so much so easily was a much-needed reality
check to my ego. I realized I needed better training and expertise beyond
dotcom fitness forums. I moved 2,000 miles across the country to join my brother
to train with giants, surrounded by some of the strongest men and women on the
planet.
 
And now that we've returned we want to pay it forward by
providing a space for specialized strength training in Cache Valley for the
rest of the Mountain West region! 
 
 
The
Vision
We started Blacksmith Barbell with a singular mission: to
produce top-tier athletes in a world-class strength facility. This region has a
deep well of untapped potential. There are so many talented, hardworking people
in the area with the ability and drive to become Olympians, champion fighters,
collegiate/professional athletes, and legendary lifters. Our goal is to
complete the equation by providing knowledgeable strength training experience;
we want athletes from all over the Wild West draped in gold medals and standing
on the world's tallest podiums.
 
 
We
Can't Do This Without You
The truth is you won't get strong on a treadmill. A gym
that forges elite athletes needs weight. Lots of it! Making individuals or
teams strong requires hefty pounds, and pounds cost pounds (or
dollars). We have the building, now we need your help to transform
it. 
 
 
We are raising funds primarily for necessary building
improvements. Our greatest goal is to raise the money needed to open the
doors of our facility as soon as possible. Timing is the most critical factor
for our high school and college athletes hoping to develop the skills and power
necessary to win scholarships and catch the eye of recruiting scouts for
professional camp invitations while they’re still of age.
 
In the event that we reach our goal, any surplus funds
raised will go directly toward equipment including: high quality bars that
won’t bend when our athletes start bench pressing 600 pounds; plates and
dumbbells big enough to intimidate Clydesdales; and machines that our trainees
will love to hate. We can’t make the journey alone. We need you!
 
In the event that we don’t raise the funds necessary to
purchase the minimum amount of equipment right from day one, then let us thank
you and assure you that your contributions will be piled in with any amount of
loans, savings, treasure maps, livestock barters, Girl Scout cookie sales,
diamond heists, and alchemy necessary to fund this adventure—it’s not a matter
of if, but when!
 
 
Impact
We’re going to put Cache Valley on the map as the
location for high-level strength training and powerlifting. We want Logan to
dominate Utah’s record books. We want local businesses to flourish from the
crowds we attract, and we want to provide opportunities for students and
athletes.
 
And we’re already on our way! We have several athletes
contending for new world records within the next two years, and with the proper
training, instruction, and sufficient weight to challenge their abilities,
success is within reach!
 
Much planning and input has been taken into consideration
to provide donors with valuable and usable rewards for their support. Thanks to
everyone for your help and feedback along the way! Reaching the starting line
is the biggest hurdle, so any contribution you can make is greatly appreciated,
whether it’s $1 or $10,000.  This Cache Valley legacy that we build will
be one that the greater Rocky Mountain region can be proud of and rally around;
everything starts and ends by working together with the desire to create
something spectacular!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

when Lee and Charlie first met. At that moment neither of the aspiring athletes
could have predicted that together they would rise through the ranks of British
swimming and both go on to represent Great Britain at numerous international
events.  Back then nutrition, like them,
was in its early developments and by trying the good, the bad, the calorific
and sometimes even the home made of the supplement world they developed an
in-depth knowledge and passion for diet and nutrition.</p>
<p>What quickly became clear to Lee and Charlie was that
the nutrition market was a sea of complex and unpronounceable buzzwords,
chemical symbols and marketing jargon that left many customers being either put
off or, worse still, encouraged to purchase products with ineffective and
unnecessary extras. </p>
<p>They grew increasingly frustrated at the often-confusing
world of nutrition and through shared experiences (and over the odd wheat grass
smoothie) decided to form Neat Nutrition with the aim of eradicating these

when Lee and Charlie first met. At that moment neither of the aspiring athletes
could have predicted that together they would rise through the ranks of British
swimming and both go on to represent Great Britain at numerous international
events.  Back then nutrition, like them,
was in its early developments and by trying the good, the bad, the calorific
and sometimes even the home made of the supplement world they developed an
in-depth knowledge and passion for diet and nutrition.
What quickly became clear to Lee and Charlie was that
the nutrition market was a sea of complex and unpronounceable buzzwords,
chemical symbols and marketing jargon that left many customers being either put
off or, worse still, encouraged to purchase products with ineffective and
unnecessary extras. 
They grew increasingly frustrated at the often-confusing
world of nutrition and through shared experiences (and over the odd wheat grass
smoothie) decided to form Neat Nutrition with the aim of eradicating these
confusions by creating a premium nutritional brand with simple effective
ingredients that is suitable for every lifestyle.  
Welcome to Neat Nutrition, we are dedicated to developing premium products for every lifestyle. In a market that is often overly complex our goal is to strip away jargon to deliver a 'neat' and easy to understand range of the highest quality products. All of our products are made using 100% natural flavourings and sweeteners and our philosophy is to: 


Show provenance
by giving customers a full understanding of where our ingredients are sourced from


Remove ambiguity
by embracing simplicity and only offering essential products that actually make
a difference


Educate consumers
by showing them how high-quality proteins and nutrients can benefit them whatever
their lifestyle


Help you reach your goals
whatever they may be, from increasing vitality, losing weight or competing at
the Olympic Games



Protein
powders: Neat Nutrition protein powders are made using only
the finest ingredients ensuring that they mix easily and taste fantastic. They
are suitable for use alone or can be added to your favourite juice, smoothie or even morning
porridge. 


Whey
Protein: Neat Nutrition’s lean protein contains the highest
quality organic whey sourced from grass fed cows; we are very proud of the fact
that it’s free from any artificial flavourings, colouring and sweeteners.


Lean
Whey Protein: Neat Nutrition’s lean protein is a bespoke mix of
our whey protein combined with effective weight loss ingredients including our
high-grade organic Matcha Green Tea, CLA and L-carnitine. This product has been
developed to promote fat loss whilst maintaining lean muscle.


Vegan
Protein: Sourced from the finest quality organic hemp and
pea protein and free from any artificial flavourings, colouring and sweeteners.
We have not compromised on taste, its taken endless research to ensure that its
also as great tasting as it is good for you. Packed full of dense nutrients and
essential amino acids providing an ideal protein source for both Vegans and
allergen sufferers alike.


Supergreens:
Neat Nutrition’s ‘Supergreens’ is packed with 20 high quality and nutrient
dense food sources including, Green Kale, Spirulina and Avocado powder. Each
one is a fantastic source of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. The
ingredients are 100% natural and non-genetically modified with no fillers,
artificial colourings, flavours or sweeteners.
Organic
Matcha Green Tea: We have poured over 100s of
samples and different grades of Matcha Green Tea to ensure that we have used
the highest quality organic powder available. Our Matcha Green tea is 100%
natural and packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and amino acids offering
unparalleled nutritional benefits. To match the health benefits of Matcha Green
Tea you would need to drink 10 cups of regular Green Tea.
BCAA
Powder: Neat Nutrition’s BCAA (branch chain amino acids)
powder provides essential amino acids the body can’t produce itself to enable
it to naturally help repair damaged muscles and increase muscle function. Our BCAA powder contains no fillers, sweeteners or colourings, is 100%
pure and consists of premium grade Leucine, Isoleucine & Valine split into
the optimal 2:1:1 ratio (Leucine 50%, Isoleucine 25%, Valine 25%).
Fat
Burner: It's taken a lot of
all-night sampling sessions but we have created an effective fat burner that is free form artificial sources of caffeine. Instead it utilises
natural sources such as Matcha Green Tea and Guarana, alongside proven fat loss
ingredients such as L-carnitine & CLA. This means you shouldn’t get that
unnatural ‘jittery’ and ‘shaky’ feeling that most heavily caffeine-stuffed fat
burners give you. 
Complete Multivitamins:
This complete Multivitamin contains 100% of your RDA but is also enhanced with
the addition of complex high-grade minerals and nutrients making it one of the
most effective available. Not only improving overall vitality and well-being
but aiding with physical performance and recovery.

the perks to your dear and near ones and can use it as a gift.
Just contact Infomagic team through mail at info@infomagic.com or  teaminfomagic@gmail.com for the
transfer with the necessary details.
Can I increase the number of
days included in God’s
Own Country Ayurveda or Kerala Tour Packages?
Yes, you can.  But
you have to pay the additional expenses as per the change.
Please contact Infomagic team through mail at info@infomagic.com or teaminfomagic@gmail.com for making
your visit custom made.  
Are shipping costs included in the Perk price of God’s Own
Country Spices & Handicrafts or Isun Tablet?
No, the price is excluding shipping costs.
Please first select the Perk you want to have and then
add shipping as a $25 additional perk. 
For example, if you have selected the Isun Tablet Perk
for $ 230 USD, please add $ 25 USD as an additional perk.
I forgot to add the shipping perk - what should I do?
Don’t worry. If you forgot to add shipping costs when
purchasing God’s
Own Country Spices & Handicrafts or Isun Tablet Perk,
please just purchase the shipping perk now. Please remember to use the same Indiegogo
account or email you used to contribute before",14.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p> Hello everyone,</p>
<p> Thank you all 
so much! Our campaign has finally come to a close. While we didn't quite
 reach our initial goal, all your kind contributions will still go a 
long way helping those in need. Every bit makes a difference!</p>
<p> 
Indiegogo will take some time (up to 15 days, per their policy) to 
reimburse the money. We will then proceed to transfer everything to the 3
 respective organizations ASAP. We'll be sure to update you again (in 
2-3 weeks) with official receipts (and possibly photos) at the end. </p>
<p>
 Now our team is already working on distributing the perks! The ETA for 
physical cards/photographs/notes is set for September. We hope the 
digital perks (including Steam keys where applicable) to reach you 
sooner, perhaps as soon as the organizations have a chance to stamp the 
printed donor list with their stamps/seals.</p>
<p> Again, big thanks to everyone who helped in any way. You guys have been truly amazing!<br/> ------------------------<br/>
 P.S.: Although this particular campaign is over, there are still other 
ways to give. We've learned that Facebook has since partnered up with 
the non-profit ""Save the Children"" foundation to enable convenient 
donations for Myanmar(Burma) flood victims. In addition, the former has 
also pledged to match donations for up to 500,000 USD total, making it a
 great way to give. Please check it out @ <a href=""https://facebook.com/myanmarfloodrelief"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook.com/myanmarfloodrelief</a> and please pass on the word!</p>
<br/><h3>What's Happening?<br/>
</h3> <p></p>A flood can take away so much from their victims. People in affected 
areas typically lose everything. Homes, farms and gardens, crops, food, 
supplies and most personal belongings are all lost. It's a major setback
 that puts the very livelihoods at stake. Things are very difficult on 
their own. Please help them out during this intense struggle.<br/><br/><p></p>

</div><br/></div>","Hello everyone,
 Thank you all 
so much! Our campaign has finally come to a close. While we didn't quite
 reach our initial goal, all your kind contributions will still go a 
long way helping those in need. Every bit makes a difference!
 
Indiegogo will take some time (up to 15 days, per their policy) to 
reimburse the money. We will then proceed to transfer everything to the 3
 respective organizations ASAP. We'll be sure to update you again (in 
2-3 weeks) with official receipts (and possibly photos) at the end. 

 Now our team is already working on distributing the perks! The ETA for 
physical cards/photographs/notes is set for September. We hope the 
digital perks (including Steam keys where applicable) to reach you 
sooner, perhaps as soon as the organizations have a chance to stamp the 
printed donor list with their stamps/seals.
 Again, big thanks to everyone who helped in any way. You guys have been truly amazing! ------------------------
 P.S.: Although this particular campaign is over, there are still other 
ways to give. We've learned that Facebook has since partnered up with 
the non-profit ""Save the Children"" foundation to enable convenient 
donations for Myanmar(Burma) flood victims. In addition, the former has 
also pledged to match donations for up to 500,000 USD total, making it a
 great way to give. Please check it out @ facebook.com/myanmarfloodrelief and please pass on the word!
What's Happening?
 A flood can take away so much from their victims. People in affected 
areas typically lose everything. Homes, farms and gardens, crops, food, 
supplies and most personal belongings are all lost. It's a major setback
 that puts the very livelihoods at stake. Things are very difficult on 
their own. Please help them out during this intense struggle.

 With your help, they will have a much better chance at surviving 
this ordeal. Please lend them a hand, so they can be resilient, live 
through this, and eventually get back on their feet.
 Individually, we each can only do so much. But collectively, we can 
certainly make a huge difference, even the difference between life and 
death in many cases.

 Every little bit counts! We promise to strive, to the best of our 
ability, to ensure that EVERY SINGLE CENT RECEIVED will go towards 
relief efforts and rehabilitation. And on everyone's behalf, we 
would like to express our heartfelt appreciations for your kindness and 
generosity. When we always try to help those in need, we also assure to 
ourselves that humanity will always be cared for.

That money will go toward office furniture, window coverings, wall hangings, bookshelves, classroom supplies, books and magazines, educational toys, a baby changing area, and comfortable café furniture with nice lighting that will be perfect for skimming through a French magazine or enjoying a latte. Some of the items — mostly the books, magazines and educational materials — will be imported from France, but I intend to utilize reclaimed and gently used local furniture when possible. Creating an authentic and welcoming French environment is turning out to be more expensive then I had hoped. However, when you see the space I've envisioned where you can be immersed in the French culture, like a little Paris in Lansing, I'm sure you'll agree it was worth every penny."" Any donation will help. That’s why I opted for a flexible fund. If we exceed our goal, funds will be used to market Aux Petits Soins, including the creation of a website and advertisement. Marketing is going to be critical because there's no other business like this in the area. Aux Petits Soins is more than just a place where you can learn to speak French. With the opening of Aux Petits Soins, we will be able to offer a place for the French community to gather.Our programs create a rare opportunity to learn French in an immersive environment and to be in touch with the French culture. To my knowledge, this will be the first business of its kind in Michigan. I hope Aux Petits Soins will be the center of French culture, uniting other local businesses and programs that have French themes, including Le Bon Macaron, a French bakery in East Lansing; Le Chat Gourmet, a culinary class in Eaton Rapids; and the French clubs at Michigan State University and the East Lansing Public Library. Of course, students and community members of all ages who appreciate French culture will be welcome to speak in French and enjoy the company of other francophiles. Whatever amount you decide to give, this is already a huge contribution 
to this project, so ""merci beaucoup"" for helping out. I can't thank you enough. And because this is such a unique project, I wanted to create some unique perks that would be true to the spirit of Aux Petits Soins. I collaborated with a few local artists to design awesome stuff. Here, check it out:Magnetic bumper sticker  and mug (pics of T-shirts coming soon!):                                                             BS#1                                               BS#2                                      M#1Don't worry, the color of the mug will match pefectly the color of our logo! The obvious risk would be not connecting with the Michigan community who would enjoy everything Aux Petits Soins has to offer. This is a very niche market, and attracting their attention will be very difficult. But I know the demand is here, as evidenced by our steady growth — it’s just been challenging connecting with parents who want their children to be bilingual. Will there be enough demand to sustain a full-time French language immersion school and cultural center? I’m betting yes. I believe it will become a cultural destination. Already, I have parents from Grand Rapids, Twin Lake and Midland who drive up to two hours each week to bring their children to class. However, I know better than to take this success for granted. By being more visible, I’m sure we can continue to grow our French community. The growth of Aux Petits Soins has been possible thanks to positive word-of-mouth, so I owe another big “merci beaucoup” to all the families who have helped me get my vision off the ground.

<p><b>WHAT IS CANS 4 CASH COLLECTION SERVICE?</b></p>
<p>Cans 4 Cash Collection Service is a
simple service that reconnects the community, creates jobs, gives to charities
&amp; is environmentally friendly. What the majority of people throws away in
the garbage, recycling bin, and in nature, is now used to help others. We
promote recycling, reusing and using less. We also attend events and make them
as ""green"" as possible.</p>
<p><br/>
<b>How it all came to be:</b> I had been looking for a job for months. I composed
cover letters, sent out resumes, and attended many interviews. On several
occasions, I was called back to attend second and third interviews. A few
times, I was sure I had the job. Over and over, I was rejected to others twenty
years my junior. I became discouraged, frustrated, and vexed. I did not give up
or let resentment consume me. On June 1st, 2015, I decided to create my own
thing: Cans 4 Cash Collection Service.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, while I was
tailoring cover letters or sending off resumes, I would gaze out my window and
observe people rummaging through my garbage and my recycling bin. I also
observed these same people rummage through the garbage and recycling bins of my
neighbors. I noted that they were in search of bottles &amp; cans that have a
deposit value. I began to realize, that just like me, many people do not bother
returning their bottles &amp; cans for the deposit money. People do not have
the time for the small change associated with returning bottles &amp; cans,
time is too precious. People either throw their bottles &amp; cans away or they
place them in their recycling bin for others that collect. The population of
“others that collect” is constantly growing. After considerable research and
investigation, I determined that based on real demand and an abundance of supply,
there was a need to organize the process of bottle &amp; can collecting. No one
has ever done before and we throw millions of dollars away each year in
unredeemed deposits into the garbage. Something is not working with the present
recycling system. Our ecological footprints are being left everywhere and
mother earth is paying the cost.</p>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;"">After several months of attending
interview and witnessing people all over the city collecting bottles &amp;
cans, I decided to it was time to take prompt action. I began by printing
flyers which offered a basic service of collecting people’s unwanted bottles
&amp; cans and commenced June 1st by going from door to door in Verdun and
LaSalle Quebec offering my new service. In my flyer, I stated that people could
donate their bottles &amp; cans to me or they could sell them to me. If they
chose to sell them to me, I offered two price strategies. If the person had
less than 5$ in bottles &amp; cans, I offered to purchase them off of them at
1/3 the deposit refund value. If the person had more than 5 $ in bottles &amp;
cans, I offered to purchase them off of them at 1/2 the deposit refund value.
That very same day, we had our first client to serve, and since that day, we
have grown at a rate of at least one client per day to serve. The vast majority
of my transactions with the residents have been donations. Later that month I
created the first Cans 4 Cash Collection Service video <a href=""https://youtu.be/Bh4IhXfnPf8"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://youtu.be/Bh4IhXfnPf8</span></a>
and began creating and designing our social media sites along with
contemplating how to increase overall web presence. Each day, while I was
distributing Cans 4 Cash Collection Service flyers or while I was picking up
individuals unwanted donated bottles &amp; cans, I met with more and more
bottle &amp; can collectors. I discovered who collect bottles &amp; cans, why
people collect, how people collect, and most importantly, when people collect.</p>
<p>I discovered that many different and
unique types of people collect bottles &amp; cans. I discovered that homeless
people collect bottles &amp; cans, people less fortunate collect, disabled
people collect, elderly people who can't get buy on inadequate pensions
collect, people who suffer from emotional or mental ailments collect, young
people collect to support special activities such as the girl/boy scouts,
people who have strong environmental convictions collect, people who are new to
Canada and lack knowledge of English or French collect, people who have made
past errors in life - who have paid for their errors by going to prison - yet
have been branded with records that still haunt them in the present collect,
people who lack skills collect, people that have little or absolutely no
education at all collect,  people who just can’t find a job collect as
well as other hard working people collect. I also discovered that 2/3 of
collectors I came accross were women. Cans 4 Cash Collection Service objective
is to organize and facilitate the bottle &amp; can collection process for all
of these hard working human beings, in turn, stimulate the economy by creating
new employment opportunities, further aid by kicking back assistance to
charities and the community we function in, and, advocate being as green as
possible and help out the environment. Half of Cans 4 Cash Collection Service
bottle &amp; can donations are passed forward to those in need. In final, I
ascertained that collectors merely collect during the spring and summer months
as the weather conditions permit. In addition, I discovered that almost all
collectors push carts and go from house to house, garbage can to garbage can,
recycling bin to recycling bin, and from street to street. I, had already created
a trailer from items found in the trash. I had already set precedent in
convictions about Cans 4 Cash Collection Service being green enterprise. Our
second video, notice the trailer I used: <a href=""https://youtu.be/keC4YKd_f38"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://youtu.be/keC4YKd_f38</span></a></p>
<p>By organizing and facilitating the
bottle &amp; can collection process, dignity shall be restored to those who
previously had to rummage through your garbage can, recycling bin, or to
dumpster-dive. These people no longer have to! More and more people will be
using Cans 4 Cash Collection Service and less and less people will be rummaging
through the trash, recycling bins or dumpster diving. At present there is
rivalry between collectors. The competition to arrive first, in the early hours
of the morning, before other collectors begin collecting, will completely
diminish as more and more people use Cans 4 Cash Collection Service. By the
same token, Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will be able to hire more and more
collectors. Furthermore, by more and more residents, businesses, and
organizations using Cans 4 Cash Collection Service we aspire to be able to pay
future collectors decent salaries with benefits such as dental, eye care, etc.
Over a 4 month period, I have communicated with dozens of bottle &amp; can
collectors of all the above mentioned demographics. On the ideal, perfect
climate 8 to 10 hour day, collectors earn in between 25$ and 50$ rummaging
through garbage cans and recycling bins. Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will
offer anyone demonstrating merit: on the job training courses, continuing
education courses, and we intend to give those hard working people flexible
work hours so that they may attend higher learning establishments. We intend to
train, educate and promote from within.</p>
<p>As a resident, by using Cans 4 Cash
Collection Service, no longer will others be rummaging through your garbage or
recycling bin at 4 in the morning. No longer will bags be left torn open or
cans and bins pushed over in search of what is refundable. No longer will
people be invading your privacy by sorting through your garbage and recycling
bins. No longer will people be pushing carts down your street in the early
hours of morning disturbing everyone by making noise. Fewer strangers you are
unfamiliar with will be wandering your street or neighborhood. No longer will
your children feel unsafe or threatened. Residents at times accumulate bottles
&amp; cans and place them aside for ""others that collect"". Most often
the collectors are neither reachable nor regular. Collectors as well as
residents also on occasion move to different areas. At times, collectors cannot
accommodate the amount that residents have place aside for them. Most
collectors merely collect in spring and the summer months whereas Cans 4 Cash
Collection Service serves our clientele all year round. By using Cans 4 Cash
Collection Service technology has been implemented for your convenience. A
resident, business or organization simply needs to pick up the phone or send us
an email to arrange collections. We have a response time of less than one hour
and 95% of our pick-ups are within a 24hr period. Cans 4 Cash Collection
Service is also in the process of designing an app for both iOS and Android
smart phones which will make the collection process further facilitated. We
presently use a cloud based customer relationship management system (which just
so happens to be a Google product). Each of the clients we serve customer information
is stored into our CRM. Likewise, the incorporation of using GPS and Google
maps has further facilitated our collections and management process thus
eliminating human error and making collections and redemption more efficient
and effective.  </p>
<p>As a citizen of mother earth, by
using Cans 4 Cash Collection Service you are being more environmentally friendly.
Less refundable containers are being thrown in the trash. Less refundable
containers that are place in the recycling bin are slipping through the
recycling system and ending up in landfills. Less refundable containers are
ended up on the streets, highways, parks and in nature. Less glass is being
thrown into mass landfills each month. More is being recycled and given a
second life. By using Cans 4 Cash Collection Service, people are becoming more
responsible for their actions, for themselves and the generations to come.
Ecological footprints are becoming erased by humble hard working innovation.<br/>
<br/>
Each year in Quebec, 400 million deposit containers are thrown in the garbage.

</p><p><span>Each day in Quebec, more than one
million deposit containers end up in nature.

</span></p><p><span>Quebecers forego 20 million dollars
in unredeemed deposits, each year. <br/>
</span></p><p><span>In Quebec per month, 1500 tons of glass is dumped into landfills.</span></p>
<p>Imagine what is wasted in Canada per
year.Then, multiply that waste by 30 times and imagine what is wasted
within the United States. Contemplate the worlds waste, and then ponder about
all the people and communities Cans 4 Cash Collection Service can aid from what
most people chuck in the trash. </p>
<p>Your contribution can make our
humble service a reality! </p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE CAN 4 CASH
COLLECTION SERVICE BECOME A REALITY.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>We need a facility to store bottles &amp; cans and
     equipment like bicycles, trailers, parts and tools.</li>
<li>We need a vehicle to transport bottles and cans. </li>
<li>We need 2 employees. </li>
<li>We need to advertise in local papers. </li>
<li>We need to mass print flyers. </li>
<li>We need modest furniture like desks and chairs, a used
     fridge and stove, a used sofa. </li>
<li>We need 2 laptops.</li>
</ul>
<p>1.  A facility for the entire
year will cost 1300.00$ per month multiplied by 12 months. I foresee, based on
the figures we have obtained thus far, and the current users we serve, that
post a 3 month period, we will be totally self-sufficient. We require signing a
lease for the facility which is a contract for duration of 12 months. (15600.00$).
</p>
<p>2.  Bills for heating,
electricity, water, telephone line, internet connection, insurance and security
have been guesstimated at 1000.00$ per month multiplied by 3 (3000.00$ in
total). As we obtain more clients to serve we will be able to pay the duration
of the year ourselves. </p>
<p>3.  We need a vehicle. We want
and need to remain a ""green company"" being as environmentally
friendly as possible because that is the company image we want to portray.
Furthermore, the majority of our target market is Eco-conscious individuals,
businesses and organizations hence we need to purchase an environmentally
friendly electric vehicle (which, I will name our ""Green Machine"") or
rent the electric vehicle for the entire year, whichever is more economically
efficient. 12000.00$ should buy us a decent used vehicle or be used to rent /
lease the vehicle (most probably the latter as the former is impossible to
find). Vehicle insurance, license plate and registration fees have all been
calculated into the amount for the entire year.</p>
<p>4.  We need two employees.
These individuals will be hired to assist in all Cans 4 Cash Collection Service
functions (answering the phone, collecting bottles &amp; cans, administration
tasks, with the aim to train and promote from within). I intend to pay each
employee 15.00$ per hour for a 40 hour work week. 15.00$ an hour multiplied by
40 hours per month = 2400.00$. Each employee will be paid 7200.00$ for the
complete 3 months.  Thus the total for both employees for the 3 month
period will equal 14400.00$. Post the 3 month period, Cans 4 Cash Collection
Service will be self-sufficient in this regard ergo, able to pay the employees
for the duration of the year from Cans 4 Cash Collection Service revenue.</p>
<p>5.  We need to advertise in
local papers and such for a 3 month period. 1000.00$ will suffice for the
complete 3 month period any additional money left over will be used to by
letterhead, pens, envelopes, stamps, ink cartridges, etc.</p>
<p>6.  We need to mass print
flyers. For 20,000 flyers in color we will need 1200.00$ to cover the costs of
mass printing.</p>
<p>7.  We desperately need two new
laptops as what we have presently are out of date and almost dead. 1000.00$
will suffice. Additionally, any money left over will be used to purchase 2
smart phones for our new employees.</p>
<p>8.  We also need essentials to
the business like plastic bags, tires for bicycles and trailers, tubes for
tires, bicycle parts and other related equipment. 2000.00$ will be more than
adequate for the entire 3 month period. Whatever is left over will be used to
buy soap, toilet paper, movable recycling containers, signs, winter coats,
hats, disposable gloves, reflective vests, lights, daily bus
passes, coffee, soft drinks and snacks for employees and potential clients
we serve, etc.  </p>
<p>9.  I figured into my
calculation 400.00$ for miscellaneous items and such. I did this just to be
sure if something comes up, we are covered. </p>
<p>The total for everything listed
above is 51000.00$. We probably need a tad more money for miscellaneous yet I
truly believe within a 3 month period we will be completely self-sufficient. </p>
<p><b>THE IMPACT THAT CANS 4 CASH
COLLECTION SERVICE WILL HAVE</b></p>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;"">We already have given to dozens of
charities and contributed food items to one food bank that we are working with.
With your help, Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will grow and grow and the
assistance Cans 4 Cash Collection Service provides to the community and to charities
in each community will likewise grow and grow as well. Cans 4
Cash Collection Service is presently serving three boroughs of Montreal
(Verdun, LaSalle and Ville Emard). We intend to eventually serve the complete
island of Montreal, the entire Province of Quebec, Canada as a country, and
then, hopefully the United States. As we serve each new borough, town, city,
province/state and country Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will reach out to
charities located in that area and financially donate to them. (We have donated
time and energy, free labor, food, blankets, and monetary donations so far.) By
assisting in crowdfunding Cans 4 Cash Collection Service you will be the
catalyst of aid and giving that Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will provide to
others in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>At present, we have 85 repeat users (a repeat user is a
     client who has used our service more than one time). We also have users
     who have thus far used the service once, ""one timers"". We are
     constantly reminding our ""one timers"" of our service and in turn
     they eventually become ""repeat users"". We began our service June
     1st this year; we will comprehend our service life cycle much better as
     time goes on. We expect the clients we serve to increase at a quicker
     rate. New new clients who see me making a pickup or distributing flyers
     approach me and either offer a donation or ask about using the service at
     a later date. Others, who have used our service before, ""one
     timers"", reach back out to me and become repeat users. We will be
     making more new new profits and gaining more repeat profits. We will be
     able to hire faster and expand quicker. We do not know how to accommodate
     people moving to far away locations as we only cover 3 boroughs and select
     clientele in various areas in Montreal. (We call our select clientele
     ""brand ambassadors"". Brand ambassadors are people who have
     several friends or family in a certain area of the city. They informed
     their friends and family about our service. They begin using our service as
     a group as opposed to one client. When we go to do a pickup we pick up 3 to
     6 peoples bottles &amp; cans at the same time in the same area thus making
     it worthwhile to travel outside our main geographic area.) As time goes on
     Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will serve many areas outside our present
     geographic area. We expect, residents who have moved into these new areas
     will reach out to us from their current geographic area and continue to
     use our service. </li>
<li>We have attended 4 major events (Beurling Park Verdun
     Soccer Event, Children's Wish - The Point Wish Softball Tournament, The Montreal
     Highland Games, and The Pharmaprix Weekend to End Women's Cancers) of
     which we have made each event as environmentally sensitive (green) as we
     possibly can (at times we have had to jump into dumpsters and remove
     bottles &amp; cans from other garbage in order to recuperate refundable
     waste). We have equally donated to each fund raising event. We worked at
     these events free of charge collecting bottles &amp; cans. Organizers of
     these events have advised us, that we should begin charging for our
     environmentally sensitive abilities and skill. In the future, Cans 4 Cash
     Collection Service will charge a rate per day (depending on if the event
     is government sponsored and dependent of the event size) thus creating
     additional branches within our enterprise which in turn will create extra
     revenue for expansion. We receive much publicity at these events and have
     been asked to serve areas such as Duvernay Laval, Quebec (26 Kilometers
     from our current location), Repentigny Quebec (55 Kilometers from our
     current geographic location), St-Sauveur Quebec (82 Kilometers from our
     current location), Mont Tremblant Quebec (140 Kilometers from our current
     location) and Vancouver Canada (4993 Kilometers from our current
     location). How long it will take us to be capable of serving these areas
     is unknown yet imprinted in my mind is the famous saying ""where <span>there's a will, there's a way"" and I am very
     persistent and I will find the way.   </span>
</li>
<li>I have worked 80 hour work weeks since June 1st 2015. The
     vast majority of people I reached out to, think that our service is a fantastic
     idea with a promising future. I have created all Cans 4 Cash Collection
     Service documentation in English and French. I have created and updated
     all social media sites, blogs, and videos. I have designed t-shirts, logos
     and stickers. I have written emails and composed hand written letters,
     etc. I have mass printed over 24,000 flyers, written a personal greeting
     on each and every flyer and distributed them to thousands of residents of
     3 boroughs in Montreal. More and more people are registering to use our
     service many of which originally received a flyer in their mailbox several
     months ago. With time, energy and an additional hard working team Cans 4
     Cash Collection Service reach out will become amplified and will multiply,
     etc.</li>
<li>We now have a web site: <a href=""https://youtu.be/Bh4IhXfnPf8"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://</span></a><a href=""http://www.cans4cashcollectionservice.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cans4cashcollectionservice.com</a> Our website
     was created for us by a not for profit organization that believes in what
     we stand for and what we are attempting to accomplish. Having a website
     has provided us with a more professional look. We are receiving new
     viewers per day on our website. People can now register online to our
     service via our website. We have 121 Facebook “Likes” on our Facebook page
     so far and that number increase weekly. People can register directly from
     Facebook to our service. </li>
<li>We have business cards and company stickers. Once again
     our professional look has increased. Last month we were invited to attend
     a business meetup group hosted by Royal Bank of Canada (RBC Bank). We are
     continuing to meet influential figures (business and politics) in the
     communities we are functioning in. </li>
<li>We have received 6 donations of used bicycles, 3
     bicycle trailers, 1 electric scooter, 1 electric buggy, 1 cash donation,
     and 3 individuals have mass printed flyers for us as a donation. These
     donations will increase as we grow, further aiding the enterprise ergo
     hiring and expansion. Bicycles and other items that have been donated to
     us that cannot be used by Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will be passed
     forward to charitable organizations and the like. </li>
<li>We have registered Cans 4 Cash Collection Service
     (Service de Collecte Cans4Cash our official business name in French) as an
     enterprise in Quebec. Taxes will be filed next spring hence more revenue
     will be paid to the Quebec and Canadian Government, likewise, the
     community will benefit. </li>
</ul>
<p>Our objectives are materializing.
Slowly but surely they will come about. Residents, in place of discarding their
bottles &amp; cans in the trash or recycling bin, are passing them forward to
us as donations or selling them to us. Each day, more and more people believe
in, spread our message, and begin using our humble service. </p>
<p><b>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</b></p>
<p>In the present, we are using
bicycles and trailers therefore our reach out and collection ability is
limited. Using bikes and trailers is ideal for the spring and summer months yet
the winter months in Montreal Quebec, are way too cold to spend extensive time
outdoors. We desperately need a heated vehicle that can transport significant
quantities of bottles &amp; cans. We will continue to use bicycles with
trailers for short distances as well as in the spring and summer months. We
will also use electric scooters in the future.</p>
<p>We desperately need a facility to
store bikes, trailers, equipment, bottles &amp; cans and other related
equipment. I have been approached by various companies (Pepsico Canada and
others) that will pay me 7 cents per aluminum can in place of the 5 cents per
can I get when redeemed at the supermarket. The distributors will also pick-up
the cans directly from our facility. Right now, I am returning all cans at
various supermarkets at 5 cents a can. I do not have the means to store large
amounts of cans moreover I need the cash flow right away to keep our business running
and growing. That means Cans 4 Cash Collection Service is losing 2 cents per
can. In turn, it means the charities we donate to, could be receiving a larger
donation. ****I return lots of cans.**** By having a facility Cans 4 Cash
Collection Service can deal directly with the distributors (Pepsico Canada and
others) thus acquire 2 cents per can more in revenue. Furthermore, time wasted
returning cans at the supermarkets will be diminished as the distributors will
also pick up all cans directly from our facility. Having less cans at our
facility means we can collect more bottles as well as other refundable containers.
(An example: Last week one of the clients we serve (repeat user) donated a 5
gallon water container which has a deposit value of 10$. A 5 gallon water
container has big deposit value. It is a large container that takes up lots of
space. Our space is very limited.) </p>
<ul>
<li>I am a hard-working, persistent, 44 year old who if
     needs be, will pull a sled by hand through the knee high snow to pick up
     my clientele's bottles &amp; cans. </li>
<li>Ever since I was really small child I love this video.
     It makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside and reminds me of the difference between
     near and far. Right now, we are far from reaching Cans 4 Cash Collection
     Service objectives. With your help you can get us near: <a href=""https://youtu.be/iZhEcRrMA-M"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://youtu.be/iZhEcRrMA-M</span></a> </li>
<li>I love helping people; it is in my nature, helping
     others makes me thrive. Cans 4 Cash Collection Service is an enterprise built
     on helping others which in turn, makes me thrive. Géraldine is the exact same
     thing as me yet with a completely pure interior and in a perfect physical
     mold. Géraldine is a legal secretary because she has to. She is also a
     professional massage therapist. She became a massage therapist out of
     passion for her dream. Her dream in life is to work with terminally ill
     children pro-bono, as a massage therapist. I promised Géraldine, her
     dream. Cans 4 Cash Collection Service is her means to an end. I deliver my
     promises.</li>
<li>I am educated with both a university education as well
     as a professional trade. Having a trade has taught me to the ability to
     work with my hands. You can say I am mechanically inclined, ergo able to
     repair, construct items from scratch, and predict problems before major
     repairs need to be performed. I comprehend how mechanical things function
     and I appreciate physical labor. Having a university education has given
     me a different perspective, a way of dealing and treating people, and
     above all, communications and personal skills. I am capable of performing
     calculations and projections, write business letters and proposals, work
     with computers, software, applications, technology, etc. I understand
     graphs, diagrams and maps. Additionally, I manifest an entrepreneur spirit
     and the drive to succeed which has been instrumental in reaching our
     accomplishments so far. I am not afraid of people, speaking in public, nor
     approaching strangers. I have been told that I am a charismatic person
     that the best thing I can do for my enterprise is come into contact with
     more and more people per day and spend less time dealing with the everyday
     functions of our business. I am limited in what I can physically do all by
     myself. Having two additional team members will allow me to spend more
     time face to face with potential clients to serve and our numbers will
     grow. Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will materialize at a much faster
     pace!</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>Cans 4 Cash Collection Service’s is
an Eco-conscious enterprise. We collect bottles &amp; cans and in the process
of doing that we reconnect the community, give to charities, create jobs, and
help the environment. Additionally, Cans 4 Cash Collection Service skills at
making events as environmentally sensitive as they can be. We are capable,
qualified, and competent in what we do and we stand behind that claim. Cans 4
Cash Collection Service provide impeccable service to those who choose to use

</div>","WHAT IS CANS 4 CASH COLLECTION SERVICE?
Cans 4 Cash Collection Service is a
simple service that reconnects the community, creates jobs, gives to charities
& is environmentally friendly. What the majority of people throws away in
the garbage, recycling bin, and in nature, is now used to help others. We
promote recycling, reusing and using less. We also attend events and make them
as ""green"" as possible.

How it all came to be: I had been looking for a job for months. I composed
cover letters, sent out resumes, and attended many interviews. On several
occasions, I was called back to attend second and third interviews. A few
times, I was sure I had the job. Over and over, I was rejected to others twenty
years my junior. I became discouraged, frustrated, and vexed. I did not give up
or let resentment consume me. On June 1st, 2015, I decided to create my own
thing: Cans 4 Cash Collection Service.
Early in the morning, while I was
tailoring cover letters or sending off resumes, I would gaze out my window and
observe people rummaging through my garbage and my recycling bin. I also
observed these same people rummage through the garbage and recycling bins of my
neighbors. I noted that they were in search of bottles & cans that have a
deposit value. I began to realize, that just like me, many people do not bother
returning their bottles & cans for the deposit money. People do not have
the time for the small change associated with returning bottles & cans,
time is too precious. People either throw their bottles & cans away or they
place them in their recycling bin for others that collect. The population of
“others that collect” is constantly growing. After considerable research and
investigation, I determined that based on real demand and an abundance of supply,
there was a need to organize the process of bottle & can collecting. No one
has ever done before and we throw millions of dollars away each year in
unredeemed deposits into the garbage. Something is not working with the present
recycling system. Our ecological footprints are being left everywhere and
mother earth is paying the cost.
After several months of attending
interview and witnessing people all over the city collecting bottles &
cans, I decided to it was time to take prompt action. I began by printing
flyers which offered a basic service of collecting people’s unwanted bottles
& cans and commenced June 1st by going from door to door in Verdun and
LaSalle Quebec offering my new service. In my flyer, I stated that people could
donate their bottles & cans to me or they could sell them to me. If they
chose to sell them to me, I offered two price strategies. If the person had
less than 5$ in bottles & cans, I offered to purchase them off of them at
1/3 the deposit refund value. If the person had more than 5 $ in bottles &
cans, I offered to purchase them off of them at 1/2 the deposit refund value.
That very same day, we had our first client to serve, and since that day, we
have grown at a rate of at least one client per day to serve. The vast majority
of my transactions with the residents have been donations. Later that month I
created the first Cans 4 Cash Collection Service video https://youtu.be/Bh4IhXfnPf8
and began creating and designing our social media sites along with
contemplating how to increase overall web presence. Each day, while I was
distributing Cans 4 Cash Collection Service flyers or while I was picking up
individuals unwanted donated bottles & cans, I met with more and more
bottle & can collectors. I discovered who collect bottles & cans, why
people collect, how people collect, and most importantly, when people collect.
I discovered that many different and
unique types of people collect bottles & cans. I discovered that homeless
people collect bottles & cans, people less fortunate collect, disabled
people collect, elderly people who can't get buy on inadequate pensions
collect, people who suffer from emotional or mental ailments collect, young
people collect to support special activities such as the girl/boy scouts,
people who have strong environmental convictions collect, people who are new to
Canada and lack knowledge of English or French collect, people who have made
past errors in life - who have paid for their errors by going to prison - yet
have been branded with records that still haunt them in the present collect,
people who lack skills collect, people that have little or absolutely no
education at all collect,  people who just can’t find a job collect as
well as other hard working people collect. I also discovered that 2/3 of
collectors I came accross were women. Cans 4 Cash Collection Service objective
is to organize and facilitate the bottle & can collection process for all
of these hard working human beings, in turn, stimulate the economy by creating
new employment opportunities, further aid by kicking back assistance to
charities and the community we function in, and, advocate being as green as
possible and help out the environment. Half of Cans 4 Cash Collection Service
bottle & can donations are passed forward to those in need. In final, I
ascertained that collectors merely collect during the spring and summer months
as the weather conditions permit. In addition, I discovered that almost all
collectors push carts and go from house to house, garbage can to garbage can,
recycling bin to recycling bin, and from street to street. I, had already created
a trailer from items found in the trash. I had already set precedent in
convictions about Cans 4 Cash Collection Service being green enterprise. Our
second video, notice the trailer I used: https://youtu.be/keC4YKd_f38
By organizing and facilitating the
bottle & can collection process, dignity shall be restored to those who
previously had to rummage through your garbage can, recycling bin, or to
dumpster-dive. These people no longer have to! More and more people will be
using Cans 4 Cash Collection Service and less and less people will be rummaging
through the trash, recycling bins or dumpster diving. At present there is
rivalry between collectors. The competition to arrive first, in the early hours
of the morning, before other collectors begin collecting, will completely
diminish as more and more people use Cans 4 Cash Collection Service. By the
same token, Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will be able to hire more and more
collectors. Furthermore, by more and more residents, businesses, and
organizations using Cans 4 Cash Collection Service we aspire to be able to pay
future collectors decent salaries with benefits such as dental, eye care, etc.
Over a 4 month period, I have communicated with dozens of bottle & can
collectors of all the above mentioned demographics. On the ideal, perfect
climate 8 to 10 hour day, collectors earn in between 25$ and 50$ rummaging
through garbage cans and recycling bins. Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will
offer anyone demonstrating merit: on the job training courses, continuing
education courses, and we intend to give those hard working people flexible
work hours so that they may attend higher learning establishments. We intend to
train, educate and promote from within.
As a resident, by using Cans 4 Cash
Collection Service, no longer will others be rummaging through your garbage or
recycling bin at 4 in the morning. No longer will bags be left torn open or
cans and bins pushed over in search of what is refundable. No longer will
people be invading your privacy by sorting through your garbage and recycling
bins. No longer will people be pushing carts down your street in the early
hours of morning disturbing everyone by making noise. Fewer strangers you are
unfamiliar with will be wandering your street or neighborhood. No longer will
your children feel unsafe or threatened. Residents at times accumulate bottles
& cans and place them aside for ""others that collect"". Most often
the collectors are neither reachable nor regular. Collectors as well as
residents also on occasion move to different areas. At times, collectors cannot
accommodate the amount that residents have place aside for them. Most
collectors merely collect in spring and the summer months whereas Cans 4 Cash
Collection Service serves our clientele all year round. By using Cans 4 Cash
Collection Service technology has been implemented for your convenience. A
resident, business or organization simply needs to pick up the phone or send us
an email to arrange collections. We have a response time of less than one hour
and 95% of our pick-ups are within a 24hr period. Cans 4 Cash Collection
Service is also in the process of designing an app for both iOS and Android
smart phones which will make the collection process further facilitated. We
presently use a cloud based customer relationship management system (which just
so happens to be a Google product). Each of the clients we serve customer information
is stored into our CRM. Likewise, the incorporation of using GPS and Google
maps has further facilitated our collections and management process thus
eliminating human error and making collections and redemption more efficient
and effective.  
As a citizen of mother earth, by
using Cans 4 Cash Collection Service you are being more environmentally friendly.
Less refundable containers are being thrown in the trash. Less refundable
containers that are place in the recycling bin are slipping through the
recycling system and ending up in landfills. Less refundable containers are
ended up on the streets, highways, parks and in nature. Less glass is being
thrown into mass landfills each month. More is being recycled and given a
second life. By using Cans 4 Cash Collection Service, people are becoming more
responsible for their actions, for themselves and the generations to come.
Ecological footprints are becoming erased by humble hard working innovation.

Each year in Quebec, 400 million deposit containers are thrown in the garbage.

Each day in Quebec, more than one
million deposit containers end up in nature.

Quebecers forego 20 million dollars
in unredeemed deposits, each year. 
In Quebec per month, 1500 tons of glass is dumped into landfills.
Imagine what is wasted in Canada per
year.Then, multiply that waste by 30 times and imagine what is wasted
within the United States. Contemplate the worlds waste, and then ponder about
all the people and communities Cans 4 Cash Collection Service can aid from what
most people chuck in the trash. 
Your contribution can make our
humble service a reality! 
WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE CAN 4 CASH
COLLECTION SERVICE BECOME A REALITY.

We need a facility to store bottles & cans and
     equipment like bicycles, trailers, parts and tools.
We need a vehicle to transport bottles and cans. 
We need 2 employees. 
We need to advertise in local papers. 
We need to mass print flyers. 
We need modest furniture like desks and chairs, a used
     fridge and stove, a used sofa. 
We need 2 laptops.

1.  A facility for the entire
year will cost 1300.00$ per month multiplied by 12 months. I foresee, based on
the figures we have obtained thus far, and the current users we serve, that
post a 3 month period, we will be totally self-sufficient. We require signing a
lease for the facility which is a contract for duration of 12 months. (15600.00$).

2.  Bills for heating,
electricity, water, telephone line, internet connection, insurance and security
have been guesstimated at 1000.00$ per month multiplied by 3 (3000.00$ in
total). As we obtain more clients to serve we will be able to pay the duration
of the year ourselves. 
3.  We need a vehicle. We want
and need to remain a ""green company"" being as environmentally
friendly as possible because that is the company image we want to portray.
Furthermore, the majority of our target market is Eco-conscious individuals,
businesses and organizations hence we need to purchase an environmentally
friendly electric vehicle (which, I will name our ""Green Machine"") or
rent the electric vehicle for the entire year, whichever is more economically
efficient. 12000.00$ should buy us a decent used vehicle or be used to rent /
lease the vehicle (most probably the latter as the former is impossible to
find). Vehicle insurance, license plate and registration fees have all been
calculated into the amount for the entire year.
4.  We need two employees.
These individuals will be hired to assist in all Cans 4 Cash Collection Service
functions (answering the phone, collecting bottles & cans, administration
tasks, with the aim to train and promote from within). I intend to pay each
employee 15.00$ per hour for a 40 hour work week. 15.00$ an hour multiplied by
40 hours per month = 2400.00$. Each employee will be paid 7200.00$ for the
complete 3 months.  Thus the total for both employees for the 3 month
period will equal 14400.00$. Post the 3 month period, Cans 4 Cash Collection
Service will be self-sufficient in this regard ergo, able to pay the employees
for the duration of the year from Cans 4 Cash Collection Service revenue.
5.  We need to advertise in
local papers and such for a 3 month period. 1000.00$ will suffice for the
complete 3 month period any additional money left over will be used to by
letterhead, pens, envelopes, stamps, ink cartridges, etc.
6.  We need to mass print
flyers. For 20,000 flyers in color we will need 1200.00$ to cover the costs of
mass printing.
7.  We desperately need two new
laptops as what we have presently are out of date and almost dead. 1000.00$
will suffice. Additionally, any money left over will be used to purchase 2
smart phones for our new employees.
8.  We also need essentials to
the business like plastic bags, tires for bicycles and trailers, tubes for
tires, bicycle parts and other related equipment. 2000.00$ will be more than
adequate for the entire 3 month period. Whatever is left over will be used to
buy soap, toilet paper, movable recycling containers, signs, winter coats,
hats, disposable gloves, reflective vests, lights, daily bus
passes, coffee, soft drinks and snacks for employees and potential clients
we serve, etc.  
9.  I figured into my
calculation 400.00$ for miscellaneous items and such. I did this just to be
sure if something comes up, we are covered. 
The total for everything listed
above is 51000.00$. We probably need a tad more money for miscellaneous yet I
truly believe within a 3 month period we will be completely self-sufficient. 
THE IMPACT THAT CANS 4 CASH
COLLECTION SERVICE WILL HAVE
We already have given to dozens of
charities and contributed food items to one food bank that we are working with.
With your help, Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will grow and grow and the
assistance Cans 4 Cash Collection Service provides to the community and to charities
in each community will likewise grow and grow as well. Cans 4
Cash Collection Service is presently serving three boroughs of Montreal
(Verdun, LaSalle and Ville Emard). We intend to eventually serve the complete
island of Montreal, the entire Province of Quebec, Canada as a country, and
then, hopefully the United States. As we serve each new borough, town, city,
province/state and country Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will reach out to
charities located in that area and financially donate to them. (We have donated
time and energy, free labor, food, blankets, and monetary donations so far.) By
assisting in crowdfunding Cans 4 Cash Collection Service you will be the
catalyst of aid and giving that Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will provide to
others in the future.

At present, we have 85 repeat users (a repeat user is a
     client who has used our service more than one time). We also have users
     who have thus far used the service once, ""one timers"". We are
     constantly reminding our ""one timers"" of our service and in turn
     they eventually become ""repeat users"". We began our service June
     1st this year; we will comprehend our service life cycle much better as
     time goes on. We expect the clients we serve to increase at a quicker
     rate. New new clients who see me making a pickup or distributing flyers
     approach me and either offer a donation or ask about using the service at
     a later date. Others, who have used our service before, ""one
     timers"", reach back out to me and become repeat users. We will be
     making more new new profits and gaining more repeat profits. We will be
     able to hire faster and expand quicker. We do not know how to accommodate
     people moving to far away locations as we only cover 3 boroughs and select
     clientele in various areas in Montreal. (We call our select clientele
     ""brand ambassadors"". Brand ambassadors are people who have
     several friends or family in a certain area of the city. They informed
     their friends and family about our service. They begin using our service as
     a group as opposed to one client. When we go to do a pickup we pick up 3 to
     6 peoples bottles & cans at the same time in the same area thus making
     it worthwhile to travel outside our main geographic area.) As time goes on
     Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will serve many areas outside our present
     geographic area. We expect, residents who have moved into these new areas
     will reach out to us from their current geographic area and continue to
     use our service. 
We have attended 4 major events (Beurling Park Verdun
     Soccer Event, Children's Wish - The Point Wish Softball Tournament, The Montreal
     Highland Games, and The Pharmaprix Weekend to End Women's Cancers) of
     which we have made each event as environmentally sensitive (green) as we
     possibly can (at times we have had to jump into dumpsters and remove
     bottles & cans from other garbage in order to recuperate refundable
     waste). We have equally donated to each fund raising event. We worked at
     these events free of charge collecting bottles & cans. Organizers of
     these events have advised us, that we should begin charging for our
     environmentally sensitive abilities and skill. In the future, Cans 4 Cash
     Collection Service will charge a rate per day (depending on if the event
     is government sponsored and dependent of the event size) thus creating
     additional branches within our enterprise which in turn will create extra
     revenue for expansion. We receive much publicity at these events and have
     been asked to serve areas such as Duvernay Laval, Quebec (26 Kilometers
     from our current location), Repentigny Quebec (55 Kilometers from our
     current geographic location), St-Sauveur Quebec (82 Kilometers from our
     current location), Mont Tremblant Quebec (140 Kilometers from our current
     location) and Vancouver Canada (4993 Kilometers from our current
     location). How long it will take us to be capable of serving these areas
     is unknown yet imprinted in my mind is the famous saying ""where there's a will, there's a way"" and I am very
     persistent and I will find the way.   

I have worked 80 hour work weeks since June 1st 2015. The
     vast majority of people I reached out to, think that our service is a fantastic
     idea with a promising future. I have created all Cans 4 Cash Collection
     Service documentation in English and French. I have created and updated
     all social media sites, blogs, and videos. I have designed t-shirts, logos
     and stickers. I have written emails and composed hand written letters,
     etc. I have mass printed over 24,000 flyers, written a personal greeting
     on each and every flyer and distributed them to thousands of residents of
     3 boroughs in Montreal. More and more people are registering to use our
     service many of which originally received a flyer in their mailbox several
     months ago. With time, energy and an additional hard working team Cans 4
     Cash Collection Service reach out will become amplified and will multiply,
     etc.
We now have a web site: https://www.cans4cashcollectionservice.com Our website
     was created for us by a not for profit organization that believes in what
     we stand for and what we are attempting to accomplish. Having a website
     has provided us with a more professional look. We are receiving new
     viewers per day on our website. People can now register online to our
     service via our website. We have 121 Facebook “Likes” on our Facebook page
     so far and that number increase weekly. People can register directly from
     Facebook to our service. 
We have business cards and company stickers. Once again
     our professional look has increased. Last month we were invited to attend
     a business meetup group hosted by Royal Bank of Canada (RBC Bank). We are
     continuing to meet influential figures (business and politics) in the
     communities we are functioning in. 
We have received 6 donations of used bicycles, 3
     bicycle trailers, 1 electric scooter, 1 electric buggy, 1 cash donation,
     and 3 individuals have mass printed flyers for us as a donation. These
     donations will increase as we grow, further aiding the enterprise ergo
     hiring and expansion. Bicycles and other items that have been donated to
     us that cannot be used by Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will be passed
     forward to charitable organizations and the like. 
We have registered Cans 4 Cash Collection Service
     (Service de Collecte Cans4Cash our official business name in French) as an
     enterprise in Quebec. Taxes will be filed next spring hence more revenue
     will be paid to the Quebec and Canadian Government, likewise, the
     community will benefit. 

Our objectives are materializing.
Slowly but surely they will come about. Residents, in place of discarding their
bottles & cans in the trash or recycling bin, are passing them forward to
us as donations or selling them to us. Each day, more and more people believe
in, spread our message, and begin using our humble service. 
RISKS & CHALLENGES
In the present, we are using
bicycles and trailers therefore our reach out and collection ability is
limited. Using bikes and trailers is ideal for the spring and summer months yet
the winter months in Montreal Quebec, are way too cold to spend extensive time
outdoors. We desperately need a heated vehicle that can transport significant
quantities of bottles & cans. We will continue to use bicycles with
trailers for short distances as well as in the spring and summer months. We
will also use electric scooters in the future.
We desperately need a facility to
store bikes, trailers, equipment, bottles & cans and other related
equipment. I have been approached by various companies (Pepsico Canada and
others) that will pay me 7 cents per aluminum can in place of the 5 cents per
can I get when redeemed at the supermarket. The distributors will also pick-up
the cans directly from our facility. Right now, I am returning all cans at
various supermarkets at 5 cents a can. I do not have the means to store large
amounts of cans moreover I need the cash flow right away to keep our business running
and growing. That means Cans 4 Cash Collection Service is losing 2 cents per
can. In turn, it means the charities we donate to, could be receiving a larger
donation. ****I return lots of cans.**** By having a facility Cans 4 Cash
Collection Service can deal directly with the distributors (Pepsico Canada and
others) thus acquire 2 cents per can more in revenue. Furthermore, time wasted
returning cans at the supermarkets will be diminished as the distributors will
also pick up all cans directly from our facility. Having less cans at our
facility means we can collect more bottles as well as other refundable containers.
(An example: Last week one of the clients we serve (repeat user) donated a 5
gallon water container which has a deposit value of 10$. A 5 gallon water
container has big deposit value. It is a large container that takes up lots of
space. Our space is very limited.) 

I am a hard-working, persistent, 44 year old who if
     needs be, will pull a sled by hand through the knee high snow to pick up
     my clientele's bottles & cans. 
Ever since I was really small child I love this video.
     It makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside and reminds me of the difference between
     near and far. Right now, we are far from reaching Cans 4 Cash Collection
     Service objectives. With your help you can get us near: https://youtu.be/iZhEcRrMA-M 
I love helping people; it is in my nature, helping
     others makes me thrive. Cans 4 Cash Collection Service is an enterprise built
     on helping others which in turn, makes me thrive. Géraldine is the exact same
     thing as me yet with a completely pure interior and in a perfect physical
     mold. Géraldine is a legal secretary because she has to. She is also a
     professional massage therapist. She became a massage therapist out of
     passion for her dream. Her dream in life is to work with terminally ill
     children pro-bono, as a massage therapist. I promised Géraldine, her
     dream. Cans 4 Cash Collection Service is her means to an end. I deliver my
     promises.
I am educated with both a university education as well
     as a professional trade. Having a trade has taught me to the ability to
     work with my hands. You can say I am mechanically inclined, ergo able to
     repair, construct items from scratch, and predict problems before major
     repairs need to be performed. I comprehend how mechanical things function
     and I appreciate physical labor. Having a university education has given
     me a different perspective, a way of dealing and treating people, and
     above all, communications and personal skills. I am capable of performing
     calculations and projections, write business letters and proposals, work
     with computers, software, applications, technology, etc. I understand
     graphs, diagrams and maps. Additionally, I manifest an entrepreneur spirit
     and the drive to succeed which has been instrumental in reaching our
     accomplishments so far. I am not afraid of people, speaking in public, nor
     approaching strangers. I have been told that I am a charismatic person
     that the best thing I can do for my enterprise is come into contact with
     more and more people per day and spend less time dealing with the everyday
     functions of our business. I am limited in what I can physically do all by
     myself. Having two additional team members will allow me to spend more
     time face to face with potential clients to serve and our numbers will
     grow. Cans 4 Cash Collection Service will materialize at a much faster
     pace!


Cans 4 Cash Collection Service’s is
an Eco-conscious enterprise. We collect bottles & cans and in the process
of doing that we reconnect the community, give to charities, create jobs, and
help the environment. Additionally, Cans 4 Cash Collection Service skills at
making events as environmentally sensitive as they can be. We are capable,

<p>The existing Laureus Snow Tiger Project is giving support to migrants of the first generationliving in Austria with great success. In co-operation with schools and educational institutions we  are working here on sustainable pathways of integration (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LaureusSchneetiger)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/LaureusSchneetiger?ref=aymt_homepage_panel</a> ).</p>
<p>But now Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since the end of WW2. Only the courageous actions of Germany and Austria has so far averted a humanitarian catastrophe.</p>
<p><b>Motivation - #refugees welcome</b></p>
<p>After a call for help of an Hungarian NGO we started with our Laureus Snowtiger Sprinter full of supplies from Vienna to the Serbian-Hungarian border to Röszke - 450 km before Vienna, so to say the heart of Europe. What was planed as a transport of relief goods developed itself into in an aid mission: together with 20 volunteers and three volunteer doctors from Germany, Austria, Hungary and England we supported 1.100 mainly Syrian refugees trapped in a cornfield, sealed-off by police forces. </p>
<p>In a starry night in addition to the flashlights of the helpers and a few bonfires our Laureus Sprinter was the only light within 5km. It was this light that has signaled the people the way to freedom – no support, neither by the European Union nor by Hungarian Authorities. Their journey began in the civil wars in Syria or Afghanistan, was marked by deprivation, incomprehensible danger, hunger, thirst and reprisals by the authorities. A journey that has found its goal in our wonderful Europe. </p>
<p>We convinced the Hungarian local police to show at least understanding to these people in need that night. Understandment for the fundamental right for protection of children, babies, pregnant women, old men, fathers and grandpas. At night around 1 o’clock we had no more tents, in the morning at three no more blankets - but that night, there was not a child, not a man, not a woman who had to stay alone, no one had to suffer hunger or thirst - Europe was there, not the political Europe but its people - even if only in the form of 20 volunteers. </p>

In a starry night in addition to the flashlights of the helpers and a few bonfires our Laureus Sprinter was the only light within 5km. It was this light that has signaled the people the way to freedom – no support, neither by the European Union nor by Hungarian Authorities. Their journey began in the civil wars in Syria or Afghanistan, was marked by deprivation, incomprehensible danger, hunger, thirst and reprisals by the authorities. A journey that has found its goal in our wonderful Europe. 
We convinced the Hungarian local police to show at least understanding to these people in need that night. Understandment for the fundamental right for protection of children, babies, pregnant women, old men, fathers and grandpas. At night around 1 o’clock we had no more tents, in the morning at three no more blankets - but that night, there was not a child, not a man, not a woman who had to stay alone, no one had to suffer hunger or thirst - Europe was there, not the political Europe but its people - even if only in the form of 20 volunteers. 




Back to Austria #sportforhope can make a significant contribution - and make the difference... 
Our approach - flight was yesterday, integration is today!With the help of the #sporforhope project the children will get the chance to recharge their batteries, to be distracted and to lookahead. 






Project outline
Through weekly  sports activities in cooperation with social workers and interpreters we will create a save environment just to feel, to move and to act as a child.
Ideal would be a socio-spatial approach, and thus a mobile offer that is adapted to the places and conditions where children and young people are.







What happens to the money?
It is our goal to start on site as soon as possible with experienced trainers and social workers.
Currently, while refugees are still arriving in a huge number, lots of temporary detention centers are built up - many many volunteersare doing a great job there!
We want to support them actively.
With a Sprinter full of different sports equipment, we are sure that we WILL reach the children qick and easily. 
Refugees might have to wait up to 1 year, until they have a final decision – this is a long time - there is great need for a projectgiving hope!.
Project Partners

<p>Hello! My name is Michelle Parada. I am a single mom to a couple of fantastic kids, a store manager at Vans, and a student at Weber State University. I am majoring in Business Administration with a minor in Botany. My dream is to leave the retail world behind and start an urban aquaponic farm!  Here is my idea:</p>
<p>    Metrogreens, LLC would like to launch an urban aquaponics farm. Fresh, affordable, naturally grown greens are hard to find in many urban areas. Space is limited to grow fresh food and since many inner cities have multiple abandoned buildings, we aim to develop a model of farming that will easily translate into an urban setting. By growing food indoors, using an aquaponic system we will be using less water than traditional farming as well as using less electricity because we will be using solar panels to supply power to the pumps and lighting. Aquaponics is the process of cultivating fish in tanks then using the fish water to fertilize the plants growing in water troughs. The plants absorb nutrients from the water in-turn<br/>filtering the water which then returns to the fish tanks. We will be able to provide the local community with affordable, naturally grown food that has been cultivated without the use of fertilizers, pesticides or GMOs. We would like to repurpose an abandoned building for the farm to help resuscitate inner city communities. Once a profitable model has been established, we will branch out into other urban areas within the United States. We will also be offering monthly classes to the public as well as free tours to the local schools in order to promote the use of aquaponics. We would like to eventually provide schools with their own systems so that they<br/>can grow some of their own food.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In order to get the business off the ground I have estimated a start up cost of $33,000. I am aiming to raise just under half of that cost through this crowd funding effort then the remaining I will finance through loans and investors. <br/></p>
<p>I guarantee you a warm and fuzzy feeling when you contribute...</p>
<p>BUT THAT'S NOT ALL!!!</p>
<p> You'll also earn perks based on your donation! Free lettuce, fish, t-shirts and more! Check out the perk section of this page to learn more!<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>By contributing to this cause you can feel good, not only about helping provide the community with fresh food, but also about improving urban areas and educating people about the benefits of growing their own food.<br/></p>

</div><div><br/></div></div>","We are the proud owners of a reindeer herd, one of a few in
the United States.  Our deer roam and
graze on a natural diet of various flora found only in the Arctic.  Because of their unique diet reindeer meat is
a premier red meat that cannot be matched. 
Our
goals for this campaign are to obtain a Mobile Slaughter and Processing
Unit.
These are pictures of prototype Mobile and Processing Slaughter Units from the High Latitude Range Management course offered by UAF-Northwest Campus.  These would be very similar to what we would get with a few modifications for extreme cold weather climate.

<p><b>Alberta Solar
Co-op</b> plans to build Western Canada's first community owned solar farm. As a member of the co-operative, Albertans can own part of this 1 - 2 MW
grid-connected (distributed generation) solar farm. The 2 MW solar farm will power over 400 homes, offset over 2000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year and will be equivalent to planting over 10,000 trees!  </p>
<p>As a member-owned co-operative, our renewable energy projects will be owned and
democratically controlled by our Albertan members. Not only will our projects increase renewable energy generation in the province and encourage diversification of our province’s robust energy portfolio, our members will also have the opportunity to share in the revenue generated from the production of electricity sold to the
grid. </p>
<p>Since community ownership has been a strong driving force for renewable energy adoption across the globe, we hope to create the same impact here. Our solar co-operative will connect individuals to a new and exciting project that greens our

Our First Community Owned Solar Farm


The 1 – 2 Megawatt solar PV installation will feed in directly to the Alberta power pool and make a significant first step in greening our overall grid. 

This project is based on present day economic realities of a varying electricity price. Luckily, the Sun tends to shine most when electricity demand is at its highest, resulting in peak power prices and higher returns.


Why We Need YOU

Before we can launch our first project
and invite Albertans to invest in this community owned solar farm, we are
asking for your support to help us start the first stage of this project. As
the first solar co-op in Alberta, we will face the highest start-up costs,
which is why we need your support in order to make this a reality. Once we have
created the model for this first project, our plan is to replicate it and build more
community owned solar farms here in Alberta.


Your contribution, no matter the size, will help us along our way in actually developing the co-operative, our first project and the model for future projects in Alberta. These are some of our next steps:

Develop the legal framework and model for the community owned solar farm
Start the distributed generator application process
Complete Offering Memorandum (A legal document stating the objectives, risks and terms of the investment)

Complete preliminary solar PV system design

and much more!

Next Steps


Once the project is finalized, Alberta Solar Co-op will issue investment shares to Albertans who would like to become owners in the project. And as a bonus, these shares will be RRSP and TFSA eligible! Members will be able transfer investment from an existing RRSP/TFSA account into the project. 
But we won’t stop there… The founding members of Alberta Solar Co-op have been putting in significant time and resources into bringing this project to reality. Once the investment and construction of this first project is completed, we hope to be working with communities across Alberta to develop their own projects and tie into the pent up demand across the province for investment in renewables.

Supporting Partners Last but not the least, we wouldn't be here if not for our amazing, knowledgeable and supportive partners. So here's a big and special THANK YOU to:",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>
I'm Bobbi Sue, an emergency nurse in Portland, OR and I have a
solution to a deadly problem.   Studies indicate that providing
too much oxygen too quickly to people in cardiac arrest is
significantly reducing survival rates.  Worse, studies show that
healthcare providers are regularly over-ventilating patients with
bag-valve-masks (BVMs) at an average of two to three times the
recommended rate.</p>
<p>
The
Goldilocks Valve System helps prevent operator error of BVMs, thus
preventing over-ventilation of patients and the associated increase
in morbidity and mortality.  This simple system provides a means
to identify and deliver patient specific tidal volumes and
respiratory rates.  In short, it can help save lives.  </p>
<p>Help support this life-saving device through the legal maze and development phase. It is currently patent pending.   Your contribution will help us continue work on the Goldilocks Valves adult model and begin development of the pediatric and infant models.  Contributions will also go towards navigating through the FDA approval process and other legal/business expenses.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How Do The Goldilocks Valves Work?</h3>
<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>
The
Goldilocks Valve System is comprised of the Refill Regulating Valve
and the Grip Chart.  To use, the healthcare provider simply
estimates the size of the patient and clicks the valve to the
corresponding setting on the index.  Then they place their hand
on the bag at the corresponding Grip Chart index location.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now, when the user compresses the bag at that Grip Chart index location until their fingers touch, they will administer a specified tidal volume.  The Refill Regulating Valve will then slow the rate of the bag's refill of that volume so that upon full refill, the user receives a tactile indicator that it is time to compress the bag again in order to achieve the recommended respiratory rate.<br/></p>

 Hello, I am Lashondra Graves, owner of LGME (Lashondra Graves Marketing Enterprizes) a Reputable Full Service Social Media and Internet Marketing/Advertising firm, author of Chasing Signs and founder of To the Least of These Ministry. 
Our partnership with India has been blessing. Since we've partnered with Agape Ministry located in Kakinada India the Pastor has opened 10 branch ministries in rural towns in India. Pastor Nagu Kumar is the Pastor of Agape Ministry and he is doing the work of God from a hut. 
He has provided opportunities for education to young adults who have no parents. His ministry supports the widows in their country and ministers and feeds the poor and homeless families, children and widows. 
Pastor Kumar is an amazing and wonderful example of what true Christian beliefs and actions should be, as he does all of this from a simple grass hut in the middle of nowhere. 


Pastor Kumar is unstoppable as he seeks out those worshiping idols in rural parts of Kakinada state. He has opened 10 branch churches to spread the word of God and save souls in that same area. He even networks worldwide using just a cellphone and social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. 


Pastor Nagu Kumar keeps pushing, nothing can stop him from reaching out to  the needy around him. 
Just recently there was a cyclone followed by a flood in Kakinada State and Agape Ministry lead by Pastor Kumar reached out and helped the families as much as he could with limited, very limited funds.

<p>This campaign is to help us finance replacement of a VHF antenna located on a tower in Theriot, LA at an elevation of 550 feet. The damaged antenna is bent over completely into the tower.  We plan to replace it, installing top and bottom braces to prevent future wind damage. </p>
<p>The estimate from a tower service company to climb 550 feet and replace the antenna (labor and insurance) is in the neighborhood of $2,000. The DB224E antenna and a side mount bracket kit is estimated at $700. Complete project estimate is $2,700.</p>

<br/><h3>Join us in making our vision a reality<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We have this big dream. <br/><br/>Change how children are treated and we change the world.<br/><br/>It <i>is</i>
 big and we’ve thought about waiting until everything was set and in 
place. Wait for the big grant, wait for the sustainable funding. Instead
 we stepped forward trusting that this dream would be a reality. <br/></p>
<p>And it 
is becoming a reality, right now.<br/><br/>It will start on March 20th, 2015.<br/><br/>Parents are ready and excited. <br/><br/>The community supports us. <br/><br/>Our staff and volunteers are waiting. <br/></p>
<p>Everything is in place. </p>
<p>Except for one thing. You.<br/><br/><span style="""">We know that grassroots movements are all about the power of individuals, groups and communities. </span></p>
<p>And, our strategy of change is only possible if we join together. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Summary </h3>The
Alliance for Parenting Education in Africa (APEA), an NGO registered in South Africa, is the collaborative creation
of a team of kindred souls who are spending their lives making visible the link
between social change and the transformation of the way children are treated in
society. <br/><br/>The APEA core team consists of Dieudonne Allo, Teresa Graham Brett, Ningi Sibisi, Rugare Ncube, Nathalie Mbenda Kangami and David Charles
Metler.  The collaborative team is working on a holistic and
grassroots relational approach to catalyze communities in working together
towards more peaceful relations with children. We have an amazing partnership with Kindred Media and Families for Conscious Living, our U.S. based non-profit partner. <br/><br/>APEA believes that social
change happens at the speed of trust and carries out its vision by building
trusting and respectful relationships between parents, teachers, youth, and
other community stakeholders to create sustainable broad-based support for
peaceful parenting and community relations towards children that lead to
lasting social change. <br/><br/><p>The
idea that humanity can be transformed through childhood is one that APEA is
working to diffuse across the globe beginning with Phase 1 in Cato Manor, South
Africa beginning in late March of this year! <br/></p>
<p>Yes that is less than 3 weeks
away!! <br/></p>
<p><span>APEA is putting its vision into action with its
initial pilot program in Cato Manor, South Africa. Cato Manor is the Phase 1 site because of the presence of a strong project coordinator with ties to local
leaders and community members.</span></p>
<p>Phase 1  will run from March 20th - June 20th in Cato Manor and will
engage parents and teachers in Ikizo (study circles) to learn from one another. This
will be supplemented by community based workshops with local leaders and teachers.  <br/></p>
<p>APEA will train parents and teachers to facilitate and participate in study circles with a focus on child development, peaceful parenting practices (including habits of mind), as well as reflective practices to understand the impact of social norms that reinforce violence against children. Upon completion of these study circle participants will be trained to create additional study circles.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>With
your support, APEA will be able to catalyze its vision beginning with its
relationship to the Cato Manor community. Our Phase 2 plans include much more than parenting Iziko (study circles) as we develop our additional support programs including micro-funding for parents, positive discipline workshops with teachers, and youth empowerment programs.<br/></p>
<p>We will expand our work<span> to 15 other African countries by 2020,
and create our sister non-profit, Alliance for Parenting Education
International, based in the U.S. We will connect with partners across the globe to work in
solidarity with APEA to continue to strengthen the transformation of childhood
across the world.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>You might be thinking, wow that is a huge vision! Well, this
is where you come in :) </span></p>
<p><span>The vision of APEA, a world in which relations with children are peaceful and trusting, will spread through the persistence of communities building trusting relationships together and rallying others.</span></p>
<p>If
you believe in this vision, join us, and build a
relationship with us in whatever way works for you, <b>whether that be with a financial gift or by using your powerful voice to share this campaign in your network</b>. <br/></p>
<p>We hope you can see what we see;
that social change happens at the speed of trust and that ideas like this can
only be realized if we work together and rally others. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Impact on Families and Communities<br/>
</h3>APEA is convinced that a holistic grassroots network of parents, teachers, youth, and other community stakeholders will maximize its impact and lead to lasting social change. <br/><br/>Families benefit from peaceful parenting practices by experiencing social support for more positive relationships and communication as well as increased mental health. Also, evidence clearly shows that interventions in early childhood can result in lasting and intergenerational change. <br/><br/>The impact goes beyond individuals as family-based programs promote positive outcomes that permeate communities (Yale University &amp; ACEV Partnership, 2012). <br/><br/>With Phase 1 in Cato Manor, South Africa, APEA will engage over 1000 parents and teachers to build peaceful and trusting relationships with over 2200 children creating a powerful intergenerational network committed to sustaining efforts towards the transformation of childhood locally and globally.<br/><p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Project Timeline &amp; Budget</h3>
<div>In order to be transparent about how we will use your donation in Phase 1 we have included a detailed itemized budget below.  If we raise below our fundraising goal we will prioritize the items that are absolutely necessary for the Phase 1 program (the training of facilitators, the Iziko - study circles). <br/><br/>If we raise above our fundraising goal we will use these funds to evaluate and document the Iziko (study circles) so we can make the greatest case for the expansion of APEA beyond Phase 1.<br/>

<p>We want to build a Youth Center in Selma because Selma has done MUCH MORE for us than we have done for Selma.</p><p><b>Wait, what has Selma done for its country?</b></p>
<p>Great question. Fifty years ago, if you wanted to register to vote and cast a ballot, it would depend on your skin color. If you tried to register to vote and got rejected because you couldn't guess how many jelly beans were in a jar, and then you raised your voice about this unfair treatment, you could lose your job.

</div></div>","We want to build a Youth Center in Selma because Selma has done MUCH MORE for us than we have done for Selma.Wait, what has Selma done for its country?
Great question. Fifty years ago, if you wanted to register to vote and cast a ballot, it would depend on your skin color. If you tried to register to vote and got rejected because you couldn't guess how many jelly beans were in a jar, and then you raised your voice about this unfair treatment, you could lose your job. If you wanted to make a difference in your community and run for office, your simply couldn't if you were Black in the South.Selma changed
that. 
What has this country done for Selma? 
That is the more important question--because the answer is hard to find. The child poverty rate is almost 60%, the unemployment
rate is 13% (double the national average), and less than a fifth of the
population has a four-year degree.
But Selma’s problems are bigger. 
Selma has segregated schools, churches, and a white-only golf course. While the
majority of the town is African American (80%, to be exact), there is a memorial for a KKK founder, the bridge leading into the city is named after ANOTHER KKK leader, and a city WWII monument separates veterans into two categories: White and Colored.
Seriously? Yep. No need to check the date of this post. 
It is 2015, and this is the city that was a huge catalyst in the Voting Rights movement. This is the city that was recently featured in a movie

That is the most important question.  We are the youth of the Freedom Foundation (click to learn more) and we have formed a group called Students UNITE (again, click to learn more) that is coming together to focus on building a dream that is now our own--a Youth Center in Selma, AL. The problems are big, but building the youth center is a good place to start.  Take a look at what will be inside: 
The Freedom Foundation and Students UNITE’s national
headquarters
A healthy café that will feed Selma AND provide job training for the Freedom Foundation's mentoring program
Classrooms for literacy classes, tutoring, and voter education
An international nonviolence training center bringing to life the

<p>We have spent a long time speaking with shoppers like you to come up with the best user experience we can, but there is always more we can do with your help. We want to build toodle into an app that has been shaped by its users. If you are donating £10 or more we invite you to join our VIP forum to feed back your comments and suggestions and engage with our development team.</p>
<p>The only issue we face is the same with all phone based services, the availability of connection. We are aware that not all networks have the same coverage and not all store locations have WiFi available. So in a small number of cases users won't be able to use the full toodle service in those stores/locations. However, you will still be able to scan the barcode of the items you want and them to your wish list and buy them later when you have connection. </p>

If you are donating £10 or more we invite you to join our VIP forum to feed back your comments and suggestions and engage with our development team.
The only issue we face is the same with all phone based services, the availability of connection. We are aware that not all networks have the same coverage and not all store locations have WiFi available. So in a small number of cases users won't be able to use the full toodle service in those stores/locations. However, you will still be able to scan the barcode of the items you want and them to your wish list and buy them later when you have connection.",0.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>She had also worked for non-profit organisations for most of her life, and knew just how difficult it was to raise funds, especially in an economically difficult time.   So, she came up with an idea: create business whereby she could employ some of those people from poor backgrounds; and create an environment that would help to sustain a few non-profit organisations, such as an environmental organisation, and an orphanage.  In addition, the business would enable a few people who could not otherwise afford to do so to go on holiday - something she had experienced first hand at times.   </p>
<p>Karen had traveled to 16 different countries in the world - many of them through tourism, and had absolutely loved it.  She thoroughly  enjoys experiencing different cultures and settings, and going to places where she can be refreshed.  </p>
<p>In getting the business going, she sought out travel agents to join with, as she knew she needed the travel expertise, and Divine Providence guided her to people who have been in the travel industry for many years - Harold and Nadia.  </p>
<p>We wanted to do tours in Southern Africa, and then start a few tours to go skiing, go to Israel, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Egypt and beyond.  We will do special interest tours, like mountain biking, or art weekends; silent retreats; or hiking.  We are going to going to well known places, such as Cape town and Clarens, the Fish river Canyon et al, but also going off the beaten track a lot....to where few other tourists go.  </p>
<p>The business had to be something very unique in order to succeed in the travel industry.   So, we came up with four features that make us unique:</p>
<p>-Firstly, our food.  We wish to source mostly organic healthy food that is amenable to all those suffering dietary restrictions - so low carb, gluten free and dairy free food is on the menu.  We also wish to source food that is locally grown, especially by subsistence farmers.  This will take a lot of work, and possibly another source of funding in order to achieve this, but we want to aim for it.   </p>
<p>We also want to source Fairtrade goods as much as possible - so far, we can only find tea and coffee, but at least it is a start.  </p>
<p>- Secondly, we wish to add a small amount ($2.50 or R25) to each person's bill which will go toward a particular non-profit organisation.  When we start making profits, we will add to this.  This is one way we can immediately begin to support non-profit organisations - and travelers enjoy the 'Pay It Forward' principle.  Of course, it will not be compulsory, but we don't envisage many people opting out.  We will start off with three NPOs, listed below.  </p>
<p>- Thirdly, we wish to offer refreshment to the whole person - body, mind and spirit  - so we will add a speaker to our tours to bring spiritual refreshment for half an hour in the evening.   </p>
<p>- Fourthly, and this relates to the above, is that we would offer speakers the opportunity to come with us for a minimal cost, thus offering them the opportunity to get away where they might otherwise not be able to afford to do so.  </p>
<p>In addition, our holidays create an environment whereby people can go away with other like-minded people, and have a break through exploring creation and the world at large.  Karen certainly made good friends through her holidays with the UK company, and knows first hand how it can work, and work well.   </p>
<p>We all have a great passion for providing people with a great holiday experience, so that they come away refreshed and excited, ready to face the world again.  </p>
<p>We also have a great passion for the environment and for the creatures that face extinction.  So, we want to be environmentally responsible in all we do - like going paperless in the office (as far as possible)</p>

<p><b>So, if you support, you will be helping to:</b></p>
<p><b>-Create jobs - so important in South Africa</b></p>
<p><b>- support NPOs such as an orphanage (not decided which one); a Bible college which trains our speakers; and an environmental initiative called A Rocha.  </b></p>

</div><p><span>Hi and thanks for stopping by my indiegogo campaign! My name is Gary and I decided to launch this campaign to put value back into our local communities and help individuals and small business re-establish face to face relationships in this rapidly growing global economy.</span></p><br/><p>Going “organic” doesn't have to be limited to the food we eat but it can also apply to the way we decide to exchange value with each other through mutual agreements. When you contribute to this campaign you'll be taking a step forward towards greater independence and choices in the free markets.</p><br/><p>The more we raise means more of these unique gold embedded cards in the hands of people all over the world. Including your hands too!</p><br/><p>If we meet our goal then we produce more cards. They are not cheap to create but the more we buy the cheaper the price per unit - which means more value in your hands and the hands of the local shops where you choose to shop. </p><br/><p>The Perks are pretty simple and give you the choice of which iconic historical figure you want to exchange or save with. Each card contains exactly One Gram of 999.9% pure London Bullion Market Association certified gold.</p><br/><p>Proceeds from the funds will go to expanding our line of cards, creating barter guides, and most importantly getting the word out about this back-to-basics approach of using money again. </p><br/><p>JP Morgan once said in 1912 that “Gold is Money. Everything else is credit.” And what is one of the biggest problems facing the world today? Debt, debt, and more debt.

My name is Gary and I decided to launch this campaign to put value back into our local communities and help individuals and small business re-establish face to face relationships in this rapidly growing global economy.Going “organic” doesn't have to be limited to the food we eat but it can also apply to the way we decide to exchange value with each other through mutual agreements. When you contribute to this campaign you'll be taking a step forward towards greater independence and choices in the free markets.The more we raise means more of these unique gold embedded cards in the hands of people all over the world. Including your hands too!If we meet our goal then we produce more cards. They are not cheap to create but the more we buy the cheaper the price per unit - which means more value in your hands and the hands of the local shops where you choose to shop. The Perks are pretty simple and give you the choice of which iconic historical figure you want to exchange or save with. Each card contains exactly One Gram of 999.9% pure London Bullion Market Association certified gold.Proceeds from the funds will go to expanding our line of cards, creating barter guides, and most importantly getting the word out about this back-to-basics approach of using money again. JP Morgan once said in 1912 that “Gold is Money. Everything else is credit.” And what is one of the biggest problems facing the world today? Debt, debt, and more debt. Whether it is personal credit card debt or the national debt we need to get a hold of it before it gets even more out of control. These little cards are the answer because when you use them you are transferring real value not a debt instrument like paper money or a credit card.Sure this is not a simple fix to the global monetary debt crisis but if we all do our part and take it on in small amounts we will be playing a significant role in solving the problem.

<h1>Histoire de Jules </h1>
<p>Quelques jours avant Noel 2014, mon neveu, Jules, seulement agé de 6 semaines, a révélé être atteint d’une maladie génétique tres rare, un Déficit Immunitaire Combiné Sévère (DICS). </p>
<p>A ce moment précis, la vie de Yoann, mon frère, et Jody, sa compagne, a basculé dans un cauchemar. Ils ont dû mettre de cote leur vie professionnelle, sociale, courir d’hôpitaux en hôpitaux afin de rester  en permanence proche de leur nouveau-né. Ils ont alors réalisé que leurs plans d’avenir s’orientaient dans une toute autre direction et surtout loin de chez eux. </p>
<h1>Greffe de moelle osseuse </h1>
<p>A 2 mois, la maladie a déjà fait de sérieux dégâts. Son poumon gauche ne fonctionne plus. Les médecins n’ont pas d’explications pour l’instant. Son foie est partiellement atteint. Aussi, il a déjà été victime d’un arrêt cardiaque et les médecins ne peuvent se prononcer sur les eventuels dommages cérébraux. 
</p>
<p>Aujourd’hui hospitalisé en réanimation pédiatrique de l’hôpital Necker a Paris, Jules lutte au quotidien pour survivre et atteindre au minimum la barre symbolique des 4kg qui lui permettra de recevoir un traitement salvateur: une chimiothérapie suivie d’une greffe de moelle osseuse. Jules pèse aujourd'hui 3Kg et a seulement pris 400g en 2 mois.</p>
<h1>Realité financière </h1>
<p>Mon frère et Jody ont mis leur vie entre paranthèses. Entre la volonté d’accompagner leur fils et la capacité de le faire, malheureusement la realité financière ne leur permet pas de rester au chevet de Jules pendant ces longs mois. Ils ont besoin de vous, de votre solidarité et surtout de vos dons. </p>
<p>Le but de cette campagne est de soutenir Jules ensemble dans cette épreuve qui peut durer plus de 6 mois, en offrant, d’une part, les moyens à ses parents de rester à ses cotés pour l’aider a se battre. D’autre part, il s’agit d’achever les travaux d’assainissement de leur maison, interrompus par cet événement, afin de pouvoir l’accueillir dans un environnement propice à la convalescence. </p>
<h1>Devoir de grand frere </h1>
<p>Je suis Nicolas, l’ainé de la famille et je vis à Sydney en Australie, loin de mes proches. Je suis incroyablement fier de mon neveu. Jules combat avec courage sa maladie pour rester avec nous. En tant que grand frere, mon rôle est de venir en aide a ma famille. Aujourd’hui plus que jamais elle en a besoin. Cette campagne est malheureusement le seul moyen en ma possession pour accomplir mon devoir de grand frère. </p>

<h1>Jules’s story</h1>
<p>A few days before Christmas 2014, my 6 week old nephew, Jules was diagnosed with a rare genetic disease called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).</p>
<p>At this moment, his parents (Yoann Rabier and Jody Ansquer) are emotionally and financially struggling with the effects of this disease. They have both temporarily ceased working and have moved from “Les Cerqueux” to Paris for specialised treatment.</p>
<h1>Bone marrow transplant</h1>
<p>During the past 2 months, SCID has caused serious damage to Jules’ health and his condition has vastly deteriorated during this time. His left lung has stopped functioning and his liver is partially damaged. Also Jules has had a cardiac arrest and doctors fear that he might suffer from brain damage.  </p>
<p>Now, Jules is hospitalised at Necker’s Hospital intensive paediatric care, in Paris. In order to receive life-saving treatment, Jules needs to weight at least 4-5kg to undertake chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant. Jules is currently 3 kg and has gained a mere 400g in the past 2 months.</p>
<h1>Financial reality</h1>
<p></p>
<p>My brother and Jody have put their lives on hold. Between the desire to support their son and the ability to do so, unfortunately, the financial reality does not allow them to remain close to Jules during those long months. They need you, your solidarity and your donations.</p>
<p>The purpose of my campaign is to support my nephew and his family. By providing financial support to his parents, they will be able to stay in close proximity to the hospital and help him fight this disease. They will also be able to provide Jules with a sterile and safe environment in their hometown.</p>
<h1>Eldest brother's duty</h1>
<p>My name is Nicolas, I am the eldest in the family and I live in Sydney, Australia far away from them in France. I'm incredibly proud of my nephew, Jules, who is fighting to stay with us. I am asking you for your help and support to save Jules’ life.

Set up in February 2012 it has grown through licencing to be in several areas in the UK. She has also been selling floating lockets (Treasure Lockets) and was one of the first people to import them to the UK in Feb 2013. The human market is becoming saturated and it was time to progress the idea to other market places. As such she began to research dog collars and soon realised that the lockets were not being used in this way. </span></p>

<p>Jo is also a married mother to 2 small children and has been running her own graphic design company for nearly 9 years now. Jo has clocked up over 25 years in the design business and has worked on various accounts across a broad spectrum of products including plants, boots, lager and sports. </p>
<p>Jo was approached by Leigh-ann to become a partner in this project and brought life and a brand to the idea.  She currently has her head down in the studio developing graphics and ideas for a full range of personalised T-shirts, gifts, cards and other pet accessories.</p>

</div></div>","What is PUG4pets?

Pug4Pets is a pet led market place fronted by the dogs and their adventures. They introduce the products, market them and test them providing a fun and friendly platform from which to showcase the business.




Behind the scenes you have the humans, Jo Ballantine (Graphic Designer) and Leigh-ann Arundel (Jewellery retailer). We originally met online through a small business support group 3 years ago and instantly hit it off personally and professionally. Our business backgrounds were an ideal platform to launch the product from so once the original idea was formed we came together to create Pug4Pets.





Leigh-ann is a married mother of 2 small children who works part time as a public servant and owns Jingle Jewellery Ltd, a children's party business. Set up in February 2012 it has grown through licencing to be in several areas in the UK. She has also been selling floating lockets (Treasure Lockets) and was one of the first people to import them to the UK in Feb 2013. The human market is becoming saturated and it was time to progress the idea to other market places. As such she began to research dog collars and soon realised that the lockets were not being used in this way. 


Jo is also a married mother to 2 small children and has been running her own graphic design company for nearly 9 years now. Jo has clocked up over 25 years in the design business and has worked on various accounts across a broad spectrum of products including plants, boots, lager and sports. 
Jo was approached by Leigh-ann to become a partner in this project and brought life and a brand to the idea.  She currently has her head down in the studio developing graphics and ideas for a full range of personalised T-shirts, gifts, cards and other pet accessories.





To ensure that the lockets are safe a process of testing designs and liaising with manufacturers began. The lockets have to be safe, fun and the design functional. The acrylic lockets screw closed and are attached to the collar via a stainless steel  ring which is secured to the collar or lead. Various other options have been trialled and the final version has been developed directly with the manufacturers specifically for our needs. The final adapted design is available only to us as per our agreement with the manufacturer.



We provide these fashion lockets, hand stamped bespoke discs and floating charms to suit individual pets. Because the discs are hand stamped to order you can have whatever you like on them. A telephone number, medical alert, fears or simply your favourite saying.

Pug4Pets is a registered member of ACID (Anti copying in Design) and all designs are dated and registered on the site. 




We have so many charms to float within your locket that you will be spoilt for choice. Below is a small sample of our ever expanding range. We also have a 3d printer which enables us to create bespoke personal charms. 





In addition to the Pet Lockets, which are suitable for dogs, cats, horses and larger house rabbits, we also provide matching items for humans as well as an ever expanding range of cards, gifts and pet accessories

We also think that we are offering you, the funder, a great opportunity to try our products for yourself at bargain prices in return for your faith and assistance.
The investment you make however small or large will go towards helping us launch with  brand experience and protection, which is so important for a small business.




The funds would be used towards;
* Setting up our website and marketing
* Purchase of the start-up stock, fully branded as this needs to be in bulk and we          need to provide choices to you the customer.

* Purchase of print and stock

<p>We are a group of
individuals from different backgrounds. Our meeting on this project as a
collaborative group (non-professional and non-profit), belongs to no ideology
or political group.</p>
<p><u>Our History</u>:</p>
<p>Initially, we are
four people behind this wish.</p>
<p>When we measured
the pending deal with this type of project, we initially decided to create a
group on the social networks to stay in touch with each other, share solutions,
tips in link with this cause.</p>
<p>Currently we are a
hundred people to gather around this goal. Among us there are designers,
handymen, architects, designers, designers, graphic artists, gardeners.</p>
<p>OUR PROJECTS</p>
<p> To
rehabilitate, renovate abandoned buildings, reuse of existing sites.</p>
<p> Fund
and establish a community village in a region of France, and according to the
budget, extend the concept to other regions.</p>
<p> Creating a community garden, set up several
types of accommodation such as B &amp; B, the Woofing but also facilitate the
dwelling to settle there.</p>
<p>Offered by this
type of investment solutions:</p>
<p> revive the economy in the abandoned villages,
while respecting the environment, customs and traditions da the region, promote
local artisans;</p>
<p> encourage recycling,</p>
<p> allow
people in need of food and shelter with dignity.</p>
<p> help the poor
reintegration</p>
<p>Rents and food are
becoming more expensive and the level of outstanding wages or scaled down, the
number of unemployed increases, the number of people homeless and without food
continues to increase.</p>
<p>React! Let waste
and encourage self-help.</p>
<p>For this, we have
decided with the opportunities that are presented to us and from the proceeds
to found a participatory village.</p>
<p><u>Values</u>:</p>
<p>Environmentally
conscious and landscape, we would bring us closer to a healthy and balanced
lifestyle, creating a community garden, set up a lot of other systems in line
with its values.</p>
<p>This type of
experience is an opportunity to reconnect with solidarity, mutual support for
both poorly housed / employees and for unemployed / tenants. We are
increasingly affected (students, seniors, young professionals). Among our
objectives to reduce energy consumption, renovate or build with the cleanest
methods possible.</p>
<p>Huddle on rent:</p>
<p>Develop a range of
accommodation such as B &amp; B, the Woofing but also facilitate access to
housing.</p>
<p>Eat better,
responsibly, consciously. Reconciling currency and barter.</p>
<p>Living in harmony
with its values, while remaining open to the world.</p>
<p>Housing finance by
individuals, for individuals with respect for values ​​such as solidarity,
respect for the environment, sharing or social diversity.</p>
<p>How many people to
be successful? (Proposed simulation)</p>
<p>Donate when you can
a stranger is good, finance and invest in a project that's better. (We can help
hundreds of strangers at the same time and in the long run. When you can
contribute to help our fellow citizens in the country is even better)</p>
<p><u>Note to potential
residents</u>:</p>
<p>Such as a 250 €
000.00</p>
<p>Do you prefer a
20-year loan for Parisian apartment 25/30 m2</p>
<p>Or join a team of
300 people (crowfunders) and collect the same amount in less than 2 years, no
loans or commitments. (No risk of default, nor debts).</p>
<p>With that kind of
money, you rescue hundreds of people, both in terms of housing, that power
level (community garden). You promote the ""build-it-yourself"" and you
are recognized, rewarded</p>
<p>250 € 000.00 / 250
= 1000 / € 100.00 (per person.) = 10 months.</p>
<p>250 € 000.00 / 250
= 1000/50, € 00 (per person.) = 20 months</p>
<p>250 € 000.00 / 250
= 1000/25, € 00 (per person.) = 40 months</p>
<p>YOUR PARTICIPATION
REWARDED</p>
<p>Short breaks
available within villages, fruit and vegetable baskets, your name in the
acknowledgments.</p>
<p>To maximize our
chances, we will focus on several projects in parallel. Depending on the amount
collected, we will fund the as yet available to projects that time.</p>
<p>For indeed it is
possible that in the meantime, assets may be transferred for other purposes, or
other individuals.</p>

<p><b>A PROPOS DE NOUS</b></p>
<p>Nous sommes un groupe de particuliers issus de différents milieux. Notre
réunion autour de ce projet en tant que groupe collaboratif, (à titre non
professionnel et sans but lucratif), n’appartient à aucune idéologie, ni groupe
politique.</p>
<p><b><u>Notre histoire</u></b><b> :</b></p>
<p>Au
départ, nous sommes quatre personnes à l'origine de ce souhait.</p>
<p>Lorsque
nous avons mesuré l'attente face à ce type de projet, nous avons dans un
premier temps décidé de créer un groupe sur les réseaux sociaux, afin de rester
en contact les uns avec les autres, partager des solutions, des bons plans en
lien avec cette cause.</p>
<p>Actuellement, nous sommes une centaine de personnes à se réunir autour
de cet objectif. Parmi nous il y a des dessinateurs, des bricoleurs, des
architectes, des dessinateurs-concepteurs, des graphistes, des jardiniers.</p>
<p><b>NOS PROJETS</b></p>
<p><span>  </span>Réhabiliter,
rénover des constructions abandonnées, réutiliser des lieux existants.</p>
<p><span>  </span>Financer
et fonder un village communautaire dans une région de France et en fonction du
budget, étendre le concept sur d’autres régions.</p>
<p><span>  </span>Créer
un jardin solidaire, mettre en place plusieurs types d’hébergements, tels que
les B&amp;B, le Woofing, mais aussi faciliter l'habitation pour s’y installer.</p>
<p><u>Les solutions proposées par ce
type d’investissement : </u></p>
<p><span>  </span>relancer l’économie dans les
villages abandonnées, tout en respectant l’environnement, les coutumes et les
traditions da la région, promouvoir les artisans locaux ;</p>
<p><span>  </span>favoriser le recyclage, </p>
<p><span>  </span>permettre aux gens dans le besoin
de se nourrir et de se loger dignement. </p>
<p><span>  </span>aider les plus démunis à la réinsertion</p>
<p>Les loyers et les denrées
alimentaires sont de plus en plus chers et le niveau des salaires en suspens,
voire revus à la baisse, le nombre de sans-emplois augmente, le nombre de
personnes sans logement et sans nourriture ne cesse de accroître.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>RÉAGISSONS</b></span><b> ! <u>Évitons le gaspillage et favorisons l’entraide.</u></b></p>
<p>C’est
pour cela, que nous avons décidés en fonction des opportunités qui nous seront
présentés et du montant récolté, de fonder un village participatif.</p>
<b>
</b><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Village participatif :</b></p>
<p>Le <span>cohabitat ou habitat
participatif est une forme de </span><a href=""http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communaut%C3%A9_intentionnelle"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>communauté
intentionnelle</span></a> <span>qui
réunit quelques familles, ménages, habitants ou groupes d'habitants ayant décidé
de mutualiser leurs ressources pour concevoir, réaliser et financer ensemble
leur logement, au sein d’un bâtiment ou d'un ensemble de bâtiment géré
collectivement par une société dont ils sont fondateurs ou sociétaires. Ils
décident alors aussi de vivre selon des principes communs dont ils ont ensemble
décidé des modalités, souvent autour de valeurs </span><a href=""http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89thique"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>éthiques</span></a>, sociales et
environnementales communes.</p>
<p><b>B&amp;B :</b></p>
<p>Le Bed and Breakfast est né dans les pays
anglo-saxons et est une forme d'hébergement. La majorité des pensions de ce
type sont gérées par les propriétaires qui offrent ainsi une alternative
conviviale et économique par rapport à l'hôtel.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Woofing :</b></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.linternaute.com/dictionnaire/fr/definition/terme/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span></span></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Terme emprunté de l’anglais. C’est un système d’organisation
qui consiste à faire travailler bénévolement des personnes sur une exploitation
agricole et biologique, en échange du gîte et du couvert.</p>
<p><b><u>Nos valeurs</u></b><b> : </b></p>
<p>Respectueux
de l’environnement et soucieux du paysage, nous souhaiterions nous rapprocher
d’un mode de vie sain et équilibré, créer  un jardin solidaire, mettre en
place pleins d’autres systèmes en adéquation avec ses valeurs.</p>
<p>Ce type
d’expérience est une occasion de renouer avec la solidarité, l’entraide tant
pour les mal-logés que pour les sans-emplois. Nous sommes
de plus en plus touchés (étudiants, seniors, jeunes actifs). Parmi nos
objectifs nous souhaitons réduire la consommation d’énergie, rénover ou construire avec
des méthodes le moins polluant possible.</p>
<p><b><u>Se regrouper pour se loger</u></b><b> : </b></p>
<p>Mettre
en place plusieurs types d’hébergements, tels que les B&amp;B, le Woofing, mais
aussi faciliter l’accès au logement.</p>
<p>Consommer
mieux, de façon responsable, consciemment. Concilier monnaie et troque.</p>
<p>Vivre
en harmonie avec ses valeurs, tout en restant ouvert au monde.</p>
<p>Se réunir en tant que

<p><b><u><span>Combien de personnes pour réussir ? </span></u></b>(proposition de simulation)</p>
<p>Faire un don quand on le peut à
un inconnu c’est bien, financer et s’investir dans un projet c’est mieux. (On

l’on peut contribuer à aider ses concitoyens au sein de son pays c’est encore
mieux)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note aux habitants
potentiels : </p>
<p>Exemple sur une somme de
250 000,00 €</p>
<p>Préférez-vous un prêt sur 20 ans pour appartement
parisien de 25/30 m2</p>
<p>Ou vous joindre à une équipe de 300 personnes
(crowfunders) et réunir cette même somme en moins de 2 ans, sans prêts, ni
engagements. (Pas de risques d’impayés, ni d’endettements). </p>
<p>Avec une telle somme, vous secourez à des centaines de
personnes, tant au niveau du logement, qu’au niveau de l’alimentation (jardin
solidaire). Vous favoriser le « construire-soi-même » et votre participation est récompensée.</p>
<p>250 000,00 € / 250 personnes = 1 000 / 100,00 €
(par pers.) = 10 mois.</p>
<p>250 000,00 € / 250 personnes = 1 000 /  50 ,00€ (par pers.) = 20 mois</p>
<p>250 000,00 € / 250 personnes =  1 000 / 
25 ,00€ (par pers.) = 40 mois</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>VOTRE
PARTICIPATION RÉCOMPENSÉE</b></p>
<p>Des
courts séjours offerts au sein des villages, des paniers de fruits et de
légumes, votre nom dans les remerciements.</p>
<p>Afin d’optimiser nos chances, nous nous intéresserons à plusieurs
projets en parallèle. En fonction du montant récolté, nous financerons au
fur et à mesure les projets encore disponibles à ce moment-là.</p>
<p>Car en
effet il est possible qu’entre temps, des biens pourront être cédés à d’autres
fins, ou d’autres particuliers. </p>

 To
rehabilitate, renovate abandoned buildings, reuse of existing sites.
 Fund
and establish a community village in a region of France, and according to the
budget, extend the concept to other regions.
 Creating a community garden, set up several
types of accommodation such as B & B, the Woofing but also facilitate the
dwelling to settle there.
Offered by this
type of investment solutions:
 revive the economy in the abandoned villages,
while respecting the environment, customs and traditions da the region, promote
local artisans;
 encourage recycling,
 allow
people in need of food and shelter with dignity.
 help the poor
reintegration
Rents and food are
becoming more expensive and the level of outstanding wages or scaled down, the
number of unemployed increases, the number of people homeless and without food
continues to increase.
React! Let waste
and encourage self-help.
For this, we have
decided with the opportunities that are presented to us and from the proceeds
to found a participatory village.
Values:
Environmentally
conscious and landscape, we would bring us closer to a healthy and balanced
lifestyle, creating a community garden, set up a lot of other systems in line
with its values.
This type of
experience is an opportunity to reconnect with solidarity, mutual support for
both poorly housed / employees and for unemployed / tenants. We are
increasingly affected (students, seniors, young professionals). Among our
objectives to reduce energy consumption, renovate or build with the cleanest
methods possible.
Huddle on rent:
Develop a range of
accommodation such as B & B, the Woofing but also facilitate access to
housing.
Eat better,
responsibly, consciously. Reconciling currency and barter.
Living in harmony
with its values, while remaining open to the world.
Housing finance by
individuals, for individuals with respect for values ​​such as solidarity,
respect for the environment, sharing or social diversity.
How many people to
be successful? (Proposed simulation)
Donate when you can
a stranger is good, finance and invest in a project that's better. (We can help
hundreds of strangers at the same time and in the long run. When you can
contribute to help our fellow citizens in the country is even better)
Note to potential
residents:
Such as a 250 €
000.00
Do you prefer a
20-year loan for Parisian apartment 25/30 m2
Or join a team of
300 people (crowfunders) and collect the same amount in less than 2 years, no
loans or commitments. (No risk of default, nor debts).
With that kind of
money, you rescue hundreds of people, both in terms of housing, that power
level (community garden). You promote the ""build-it-yourself"" and you
are recognized, rewarded
250 € 000.00 / 250
= 1000 / € 100.00 (per person.) = 10 months.
250 € 000.00 / 250
= 1000/50, € 00 (per person.) = 20 months
250 € 000.00 / 250
= 1000/25, € 00 (per person.) = 40 months
YOUR PARTICIPATION
REWARDED
Short breaks
available within villages, fruit and vegetable baskets, your name in the
acknowledgments.
To maximize our
chances, we will focus on several projects in parallel. Depending on the amount
collected, we will fund the as yet available to projects that time.
For indeed it is
possible that in the meantime, assets may be transferred for other purposes, or
other individuals.

A PROPOS DE NOUS
Nous sommes un groupe de particuliers issus de différents milieux. Notre
réunion autour de ce projet en tant que groupe collaboratif, (à titre non
professionnel et sans but lucratif), n’appartient à aucune idéologie, ni groupe
politique.
Notre histoire :
Au
départ, nous sommes quatre personnes à l'origine de ce souhait.
Lorsque
nous avons mesuré l'attente face à ce type de projet, nous avons dans un
premier temps décidé de créer un groupe sur les réseaux sociaux, afin de rester
en contact les uns avec les autres, partager des solutions, des bons plans en
lien avec cette cause.
Actuellement, nous sommes une centaine de personnes à se réunir autour
de cet objectif. Parmi nous il y a des dessinateurs, des bricoleurs, des
architectes, des dessinateurs-concepteurs, des graphistes, des jardiniers.
NOS PROJETS
  Réhabiliter,
rénover des constructions abandonnées, réutiliser des lieux existants.
  Financer
et fonder un village communautaire dans une région de France et en fonction du
budget, étendre le concept sur d’autres régions.
  Créer
un jardin solidaire, mettre en place plusieurs types d’hébergements, tels que
les B&B, le Woofing, mais aussi faciliter l'habitation pour s’y installer.
Les solutions proposées par ce
type d’investissement : 
  relancer l’économie dans les
villages abandonnées, tout en respectant l’environnement, les coutumes et les
traditions da la région, promouvoir les artisans locaux ;
  favoriser le recyclage, 
  permettre aux gens dans le besoin
de se nourrir et de se loger dignement. 
  aider les plus démunis à la réinsertion
Les loyers et les denrées
alimentaires sont de plus en plus chers et le niveau des salaires en suspens,
voire revus à la baisse, le nombre de sans-emplois augmente, le nombre de
personnes sans logement et sans nourriture ne cesse de accroître.
RÉAGISSONS ! Évitons le gaspillage et favorisons l’entraide.
C’est
pour cela, que nous avons décidés en fonction des opportunités qui nous seront
présentés et du montant récolté, de fonder un village participatif.



Village participatif :
Le cohabitat ou habitat
participatif est une forme de communauté
intentionnelle qui
réunit quelques familles, ménages, habitants ou groupes d'habitants ayant décidé
de mutualiser leurs ressources pour concevoir, réaliser et financer ensemble
leur logement, au sein d’un bâtiment ou d'un ensemble de bâtiment géré
collectivement par une société dont ils sont fondateurs ou sociétaires. Ils
décident alors aussi de vivre selon des principes communs dont ils ont ensemble
décidé des modalités, souvent autour de valeurs éthiques, sociales et
environnementales communes.
B&B :
Le Bed and Breakfast est né dans les pays
anglo-saxons et est une forme d'hébergement. La majorité des pensions de ce
type sont gérées par les propriétaires qui offrent ainsi une alternative
conviviale et économique par rapport à l'hôtel.

Woofing :



Terme emprunté de l’anglais. C’est un système d’organisation
qui consiste à faire travailler bénévolement des personnes sur une exploitation
agricole et biologique, en échange du gîte et du couvert.
Nos valeurs : 
Respectueux
de l’environnement et soucieux du paysage, nous souhaiterions nous rapprocher
d’un mode de vie sain et équilibré, créer  un jardin solidaire, mettre en
place pleins d’autres systèmes en adéquation avec ses valeurs.
Ce type
d’expérience est une occasion de renouer avec la solidarité, l’entraide tant
pour les mal-logés que pour les sans-emplois. Nous sommes
de plus en plus touchés (étudiants, seniors, jeunes actifs). Parmi nos
objectifs nous souhaitons réduire la consommation d’énergie, rénover ou construire avec
des méthodes le moins polluant possible.
Se regrouper pour se loger : 
Mettre
en place plusieurs types d’hébergements, tels que les B&B, le Woofing, mais
aussi faciliter l’accès au logement.
Consommer
mieux, de façon responsable, consciemment. Concilier monnaie et troque.
Vivre
en harmonie avec ses valeurs, tout en restant ouvert au monde.
Se réunir en tant que
 particuliers pour rénover et construire des habitations participatifs,
consommer avec conscience et responsabilité.
Financer
des logements par des particuliers, pour les particuliers  dans le respect des valeurs telles que la
solidarité, le respect de l'environnement, le partage ou encore la mixité
sociale.


-  Une vie coûteuse : http://blogs.mediapart.fr/blog/bernard-ernewein/231113/ce-n-est-pas-le-smic-qui-est-cher-mais-le-cout-de-la-vie-en-france-plus-eleve-qu-ailleurs
-  Sans activité : http://www.journaldunet.com/economie/magazine/en-chiffres/chomeurs-en-france.shtml
-  Sans logements : http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2014/01/30/soixante-ans-apres-l-hiver-1954-le-mal-logement-perdure_4357253_3224.html
Combien de personnes pour réussir ? (proposition de simulation)
Faire un don quand on le peut à
un inconnu c’est bien, financer et s’investir dans un projet c’est mieux. (On
peut aider des centaines d’inconnus en même temps et sur le long terme. Lorsque
l’on peut contribuer à aider ses concitoyens au sein de son pays c’est encore
mieux)

Note aux habitants
potentiels : 
Exemple sur une somme de
250 000,00 €
Préférez-vous un prêt sur 20 ans pour appartement
parisien de 25/30 m2
Ou vous joindre à une équipe de 300 personnes
(crowfunders) et réunir cette même somme en moins de 2 ans, sans prêts, ni
engagements. (Pas de risques d’impayés, ni d’endettements). 
Avec une telle somme, vous secourez à des centaines de
personnes, tant au niveau du logement, qu’au niveau de l’alimentation (jardin
solidaire). Vous favoriser le « construire-soi-même » et votre participation est récompensée.
250 000,00 € / 250 personnes = 1 000 / 100,00 €
(par pers.) = 10 mois.
250 000,00 € / 250 personnes = 1 000 /  50 ,00€ (par pers.) = 20 mois
250 000,00 € / 250 personnes =  1 000 / 
25 ,00€ (par pers.) = 40 mois


VOTRE
PARTICIPATION RÉCOMPENSÉE
Des
courts séjours offerts au sein des villages, des paniers de fruits et de
légumes, votre nom dans les remerciements.
Afin d’optimiser nos chances, nous nous intéresserons à plusieurs
projets en parallèle. En fonction du montant récolté, nous financerons au
fur et à mesure les projets encore disponibles à ce moment-là.
Car en
effet il est possible qu’entre temps, des biens pourront être cédés à d’autres
fins, ou d’autres particuliers.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</p><p> Hearts for Heroes Corp. <b>""H4HUS"" </b>is a 501(c)(3) organization that provides equine-assisted and canine-assisted therapy to US Military Veterans suffering from physical and psychological impairments, including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). </p>
<p>H4HUS offers this support to veterans FREE of charge, which is why we need your support to help fund our programs. H4HUS has programs designed to incorporate equine and canine therapy in connection with services of licensed social workers and mental health care practitioners. H4HUS targets its services to veterans who have completed service or cannot return to service due to medical reasons in addition to active service members between tours. </p>
<p>The equine-assisted programs set goals for the veteran to learn a specific task, solve problems, build teams and relationships, and increase confidence and self-esteem. These programs include handling horses on the ground, grooming school, equine assisted riding, therapeutic driving, and combined driving (team driving). </p>
<p>H4HUS programs, and its volunteers, use the Equine Assisted Learning (EAL) and Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association (EAGALA) models. Such certification ensures that training is established for non-verbal communication, problem solving, taking responsibility, relationship building and teamwork, and Equine Assisted Psychotherapy (EAP). </p>
<p>H4HUS works with both the Therapeutic Equestrian Center <b>""TEC"" </b>facility in Cold Spring, New York and Gossamer Farms in Cameron, North Carolina where it operates programs out of these existing facilities and resources. </p>
<p>TEC is an established 501(c)(3) organization that has a suitable facility, trained therapy horses and network of certified volunteers. Gossamer Farms is located near Southern Pines, North Carolina, in close proximity to the Fort Bragg military base where many of our military return to from abroad. H4HUS hopes to establish similar type programs in New Jersey in the future. </p>
<p>In addition to the equine-assisted programs, H4HUS provides canine-assisted therapy programs where certified therapy dogs and handlers visit veterans’ hospitals for those unable to leave due to injury or mental health reasons. </p>
<p>This year, as new program, H4HUS has partnered with K2 Solutions, Inc. <b>""K2"" </b>to create a canine handling program for veterans. K2 is one of the finest canine programs of its kind, specializing in training dogs for military, security and search and rescue work. </p>
<p>As more veterans return from deployment overseas, K2 is expanding their efforts to facilitate the training of service dogs that can help those coping with physical and psychological impairments. In a unique approach designed to help canines and humans alike, K2 will be covering the ""kill"" shelters in North Carolina to procure suitable dogs to participate in this program. </p>
<p>Once the dog has undergone an extensive 5 month training program, it will be matched up with a veteran. These newly formed partnerships will participate in team building exercises, problem solving tasks, and participate in a 10-week curriculum. Our H4HUS mental health specialists will be present during all phases of the program. Upon completion of this program, veterans will be given the option to permanently adopt their canine partner. </p>
<p>If any dogs are not adopted, they will be moved forward into the next group of veterans coming through our canine program. It is our hope that this team building will restore some of the loss of unit, structure, camaraderie and friendship that certain of our veterans are missing. </p>

<div>
<p>We are seeking to raise $10,000 to start a pilot program that will train and employ local
youth to install, distribute and maintain home solar energy/lighting systems for people in rural villages and towns in South
Africa without access to consistent, reliable, and renewable power. The money raised, after expenses, will pay for 50 solar lighting systems to begin this project.</p>
<p>We know, if we teach people how to build and use solar
solutions for their energy needs their lives and their communities will be changed for years to come.</p>
<p>We know, replacing kerosene as a primary fuel source with
solar energy solutions will bring improvement to the health and well-being of women,
children and communities.</p>
<p>We are committed to creating long term solutions to the
energy and economic needs of energy impoverished communities in South Africa
and other developing countries.</p>

<p></p>
<p>This lack of electricity deprives people of basic
necessities.</p>
<p>The majority of the people living in South Africa do not
have access to consistent and reliable electricity. </p>
<p>Families rely on burning kerosene and biomass over open
fires or in inefficient stoves. This contributes to health-threatening indoor
air pollution.</p>
<p>People, mostly women and children, walk miles just to
purchase small amounts of kerosene so families can eat and children have a
light to study by.</p>
<p>As many as 2 million deaths each year are attributed to this
risk factor.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization estimates that 1.6 million of
these deaths are women and children, whose responsibility for domestic chores
makes them relatively more exposed to indoor air pollution from cooking and
heating.( World Health Organization (WHO), “Indoor Air Pollution and Health,”
Fact Sheet #292 (Geneva: June 2005).</p>
<p>South Africa gets an average of 2500 hours of sunlight per
year. </p>
<p>This makes South Africa a perfect location for harnessing solar energy.</p>
<p>The cost of a solar energy system is significantly less
than the financial and human costs of buying and using fuels like kerosene.</p>
<p>Most people in underdeveloped countries and communities do
not have access to resources and information about solar energy systems. This
lack of information and education creates challenges when presenting solar energy as an alternative to kerosene for their lighting and power
needs.</p>
<p>By making a contribution you will be supporting a global
movement towards making solar energy more affordable and accessible to the
folks who need it most.</p>

as one of 24 teachers in the U.S. to visit South Africa. These teachers were
selected by and funded through the Toyota International Teacher Program and the
Institute of International Education (IIE). 

<p>Pam’s “once-in-a-lifetime experience"" has transformed
her and the lives of people living in the impoverished townships of South
Africa.</p>
<p>She recalls - “All I could think of is how wrong it felt to
be sitting on a coach bus, looking down at the township and its folk, taking
pictures of them as if they were some type of attraction, and then knowing that
I was going to eat my fill in a quality restaurant and sleep in a four star
hotel that night."" </p>
<p>The connection between a lack of consistent renewable energy
and the education of the South African youth hit home with Pam when she
realized students leave school and  have
no safe and consistent  lighting in their
homes by which to study. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1305783/files/20150318115154-Mali_2.jpg?1426704714"" src="""" style=""width: 416.890510948905px; height: 334px;""/></p><small>Girls in Mali building their solar jar lights.</small><div>

impoverished South African townships, <b>Educo Africa</b> helps to empower and
transform disadvantaged South African communities by focusing on vulnerable
youth, their parents/guardians, and their social environment. </p>
<p>Upon return from South Africa, Pam contacted Mark Gamble,
CEO of <b>Educo Africa</b>. In the fall of 2012, Pam and Mark came up with the idea of
fusing science education with the needs of the people in South Africa by
finding a low-cost way to provide solar-powered lanterns to people with no

incorporated more technology, engineering, and math into the lessons. She also
envisioned the possibility of teaching South African students to design and
build their own solar-powered lanterns, using some simple materials they can
already access such as a glass jar or other clear containers.</p>

</div></div>","Summary

We are seeking to raise $10,000 to start a pilot program that will train and employ local
youth to install, distribute and maintain home solar energy/lighting systems for people in rural villages and towns in South
Africa without access to consistent, reliable, and renewable power. The money raised, after expenses, will pay for 50 solar lighting systems to begin this project.
We know, if we teach people how to build and use solar
solutions for their energy needs their lives and their communities will be changed for years to come.
We know, replacing kerosene as a primary fuel source with
solar energy solutions will bring improvement to the health and well-being of women,
children and communities.
We are committed to creating long term solutions to the
energy and economic needs of energy impoverished communities in South Africa
and other developing countries.







SUNDANCE SOLAR has partnered with Educo Africa and ASPIRE
Youth, two local non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Working together, we
will provide the equipment, business & technical training and
mentoring necessary to educate people in urban and
rural areas on the health and economic benefits of the use of solar energy. 


We know supplying homes with solar energy systems and
training and mentoring the youth contributes to improving the health and standard of living of families and their communities. 
We know every act of kindness and empowerment inspires
another. (Read Pam’s story)
We know, others need your help and support.   
We know working together we can make a difference.

Some Facts


In the 21st century there are millions of people who do not
have a single light bulb in their homes. 
Roughly 1.6 billion people worldwide do not have access to electricity in their homes, representing more than 25% of the world population.



Most of the electricity-deprived live in sub-Saharan Africa. 




This lack of electricity deprives people of basic
necessities.
The majority of the people living in South Africa do not
have access to consistent and reliable electricity. 
Families rely on burning kerosene and biomass over open
fires or in inefficient stoves. This contributes to health-threatening indoor
air pollution.
People, mostly women and children, walk miles just to
purchase small amounts of kerosene so families can eat and children have a
light to study by.
As many as 2 million deaths each year are attributed to this
risk factor.
The World Health Organization estimates that 1.6 million of
these deaths are women and children, whose responsibility for domestic chores
makes them relatively more exposed to indoor air pollution from cooking and
heating.( World Health Organization (WHO), “Indoor Air Pollution and Health,”
Fact Sheet #292 (Geneva: June 2005).
South Africa gets an average of 2500 hours of sunlight per
year. 
This makes South Africa a perfect location for harnessing solar energy.
The cost of a solar energy system is significantly less
than the financial and human costs of buying and using fuels like kerosene.
Most people in underdeveloped countries and communities do
not have access to resources and information about solar energy systems. This
lack of information and education creates challenges when presenting solar energy as an alternative to kerosene for their lighting and power
needs.
By making a contribution you will be supporting a global
movement towards making solar energy more affordable and accessible to the
folks who need it most.
Pam's Story – Pennsylvania science teacher inspired to make a difference!


Pamela Ulicny, a biology and environmental science teacher at Tri-Valley Jr/Sr High School in Hegins, PA is making her light shine on the impoverished areas of South Africa.



Pam’s journey began in April of 2011 when she was selected
as one of 24 teachers in the U.S. to visit South Africa. These teachers were
selected by and funded through the Toyota International Teacher Program and the
Institute of International Education (IIE). 

Pam’s “once-in-a-lifetime experience"" has transformed
her and the lives of people living in the impoverished townships of South
Africa.
She recalls - “All I could think of is how wrong it felt to
be sitting on a coach bus, looking down at the township and its folk, taking
pictures of them as if they were some type of attraction, and then knowing that
I was going to eat my fill in a quality restaurant and sleep in a four star
hotel that night."" 
The connection between a lack of consistent renewable energy
and the education of the South African youth hit home with Pam when she
realized students leave school and  have
no safe and consistent  lighting in their
homes by which to study. Girls in Mali building their solar jar lights.

However, during her trip to South Africa, Pam learned about Educo Africa. A non-profit organization working with at-risk youth from
impoverished South African townships, Educo Africa helps to empower and
transform disadvantaged South African communities by focusing on vulnerable
youth, their parents/guardians, and their social environment. 
Upon return from South Africa, Pam contacted Mark Gamble,
CEO of Educo Africa. In the fall of 2012, Pam and Mark came up with the idea of
fusing science education with the needs of the people in South Africa by
finding a low-cost way to provide solar-powered lanterns to people with no
access to electricity.


Students from PA with their completed solar jar lights.

Pam created a science education unit tied directly to the alternative
energy unit in her high school environmental science class. The unit
incorporated more technology, engineering, and math into the lessons. She also
envisioned the possibility of teaching South African students to design and
build their own solar-powered lanterns, using some simple materials they can
already access such as a glass jar or other clear containers.


Students in Nicaragua learn about solar energy.
In November 2012, Pam partnered with SUNDANCE SOLAR to design a working prototype of a solar
powered LED jar light kit. After a few months, we had a circuit board designed
and produced in order to create a functional do-it-yourself kit.
The outcome of this collaboration is the SunBender DIY Solar LED Jar Light Kit. This kit is a simple way of turning a recycled jar into a functioning solar lantern and is available to teachers and the general public.


Pam also developed a detailed curriculum guide for teachers,
homeschoolers, and parents. The guide is available free on SUNDANCE SOLAR'S website.
Today, Pam and her students continue to work with SUNDANCE SOLAR and ASPIRE Youth to find solutions to the energy challenges facing South African youth, their families and communities.
