<p> </p>
<p>I thought we'd try something a little different this time around. We always rent a soundsystem and lights for this party. The rental cost, transportation, and gas for the generator come party time is not cheap and in the past this money has come straight out of the organizers pockets (with many generous individuals pitching in come party time). This has always worked in the past, but I think if we try crowd funding the rental costs for this party we could rent much better sound and lights and it would be much more convenient for the organizers to have all this money in advance rather than hoping it gets partially reimbursed on the weekend of the party. In the past the rentals have been a few hundred bucks. I'm thinking this time we should step it up! Let's get a system that can knock the pine needles off the trees!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've set the goal at 700. I don't really expect to get that much, but if we do, great. We'll be able to rent a totally killer sound and light setup that puts to shame anything we've had in the past. Any amount helps though! This website is not like kickstarter in that we get nothing if we don't reach our goal. All of the money you donate will go towards the rental fees for the sound and lights and gas for the generator. Even if we only get 100 bucks through this website we'll still receive it at the end of the campaign and it will help a lot in making this party great.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every. Single. Dollar. you donate will go towards either sound, lights, or generator gas. I promise I won't buy whip its with any of it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If, in the past, you were one of those awesome peeps that threw us some cash come party time, use this website instead and do it in advance! It'll help us out a lot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The person who makes the single biggest contribution will be forever blessed by the noodly appendages of FSM.</p>

<p><b>How we came to this point</b></p>
<p>Twelfth Night is one of Shakespeare’s comedies. The reason
why this brand new theatre company has decided to do Twelfth Night is because
we fell in love with it during a stage reading. Last year Foundling’s Theatre
put on No Sleep Shakespeare. A festival where we preformed Shakespeare for 24
hours on his birthday. And you guessed it, we didn’t sleep. </p>
<p>Twelfth Night goes right along with our mission statement.
The show is completely about losing family, creating surrogate families, and of
course reuniting families. Ever since we preformed it we have been hard at
work creating concepts and planning out the show. </p>
<p><b>Where your money will go</b></p>
<p>All the money will go straight into putting up this show. We need things like space rental, a set, lights costumes, props, and so much more.  With your help this show can go up with out
our actors having to be naked on stage. </p>

<h3>Who is writing this blog?</h3>
<p align=""justify"">I am Thomas Fant; a twenty-one year old modern dancer from Norfolk, Virginia with the opportunity to spend four weeks this summer dancing in Rochester, NY and Manhattan, NY.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Currently I am a dancer with Todd Rosenlieb Dance, a local modern dance company performing an original repertoire of works by Todd Rosenlieb and Ricardo Melendez, Erick Hawkins, Bill Evans, Jon Lehrer, and Kathy Brenner, as well as classical and contemporary ballet repertoire. The company blends classical and modern forms, the ""downtown"" spirit, hints of pop culture, and a keen sense of musicality to present a style all its own. An ecclectic sensibility allows for the use of a diverse music palette that ranges from Brahms to Rufus Wainwright.</p>
<p align=""justify"">I believe expression through movement is the most basic and instinctive form of communication, without which beauty cannot be experienced ocularly. Dance is the tool to accomplish this. For some reason modern dance, unlike theater, classical music or literature, is often thought of as fleeting, ephemeral, disposable. But just like any art form, modern dance has a heritage that can, and should, be kept alive. José Limón believed this, and expressed these views through his company. I have been given the chance to learn from his successors, and from the knowledge I will have gained I will have the opportunity to share his dance technique, repertory, and philosophies with subsequent generations of dancers; not only through the preservation of his teachings, but also by incorporating his teachings into contemporary technique.</p>
<h3>What's this campaign about?</h3>
<p align=""justify"">For two weeks the José Limón Dance Foundation will host an intensive dance study at SUNY College at Brockport. Focusing on the individual, the summer residence offers Limón technique class every day, plus repertory workshop sessions including Limón repertory, ensemble works and solos, new repertory works, performance techniques, principals of the technique set forth by José Limón, composition, somatics, and many more. Special evening activities and individual coaching are also offered throughout the two weeks, and the residency concludes with an informal presentation of repertory and composition.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Toward the end of the summer, the José Limón Dance Foundation will host a two week teaching workshop at NYU Steinhardt examining the use of Humphrey/Limón principles in contemporary dance training. Over the two week workshop each participant will find an individual approach to Limon-based teaching. Classes will consist of daily technique classes, an exploration of the underlying principles, phrases from repertory (contemporary and classic) and the use of rhythm and music in Limon classes. Participants have opportunities to present class materials and contemporary dance phrase sequences based on Limón principles.</p>

<h3>Where do you fall into play?</h3>
<p align=""justify"">With the help of generous supporters I will be able to raise the funds to realize my goal of <del>taking over the world</del> dancing with this world-class company for the summer. As idealistic as this website makes the fund raising process seem, it isn't solely up to you (nor would I be so idealistic to think it would be), as I plan on raising money on my own, as well. But for those who participate in the fund raising process there are special ""perks"" I am willing to offer for different levels of contribution. Feel free to check the sidebar to the right to view all the different levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently I have raised $450 from teaching a musical theatre camp; I hope to raise more in the proceeding months!!</li>
</ul><p align=""justify"">I will chronicle my time in residency in a special <a href=""http://www.limondancetoz.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dances with Lemons</a> blog, chock-full of stories, photos, videos, songs, movement scores, and notes from the intensive workshops. I hope to interview Carla Maxwell (artistic director), Roxanne D'Orleans Juste (artistic associate), and outstanding members of the Limón Dance Company, as well as tell you all the behind-the-scenes happenings!! As project backers, you'll have a stake in my process, with opportunities to make requests of my documentation, learn about and even ask questions of The Limón Dance company and modern dance in general. You’ll also get regular updates about my month-long experience and receive personalized thank-you's featured in the blog. I will literally be taking<strong><em> you all </em></strong>to New York with me. I really need your contributions to get me there!!</p>

DETROIT! Get Ready!  The highly anticipated Diamond Girls stage play is here! The debut will be held on Saturday, November 3 at the Paul Robeson Theater in Detroit, MI. There will be 2 shows: 3:00pm Matinee and an 8:00pm main show.
Diamond Girls is an all new kind of stage play that has never been done before! It’s a dramatic stage play and documentary about: 

the desperate choices women make when choosing to date drug dealers, 
the superficial lifestyles they desire to live, and 
the consequences they face as a result of their choices.    
The stage play will be a vehicle to promote the Diamond Girls full length documentary that will provide victimized women with a platform to tell their true triumphant stories of recovery, restoration & redemption.  This is a story that must be told and heard!  Help us to get the word out by lending your support today!

<h2>Cool Stuff at Theatre Project</h2>
<p>Since 1971, Theatre Project has been at the forefront of presenting what’s next in performance. New work in theatre, dance, music, poetry, puppetry, multi-media, performance art, and things that defy description have all debuted here. For the last several seasons, much of our focus has been concentrated on presenting new and exciting emerging artists from right here in the Greater Baltimore area.</p>
<p>But, we are also dedicated to connecting our audiences with a global community of performers. To that end we are always looking to expand our offerings from outside of Baltimore. In the coming months we have scheduled three different productions, in three different genres, from all over the map, including New York, Israel, and Southeast Asia (by way of Chicago.) We have created the ongoing <strong>Cool Stuff at Theatre Project</strong> campaign to help us bring these shows to Baltimore.</p>

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p><em>Footprints</em> - A new play by Molly Noonan</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi folks! ""Footprints"" is a ""queer romantic drama,"" and very near to my heart. It would mean everything to be able to fully produce it.</p>
<p>""What do you do when the footprints stop?""</p>
<p>Lost in a minefield, a deserting soldier looking for answers relives the pain of repressing his sexuality and love for a best friend and fellow soldier. </p>
<p>""Footprints"" will be touring the Vancouver Island Fringe Festivals in August 2013, and between entrance fees and production costs, we need all the help we can get!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>The bulk amount of fundraising will go to helping us get a rehearsal space. Having worked on productions that involve always scrounging for space in some unused classroom, I know that the effect of having a steady, work-oriented space all our own has an amazingly positive effect on a show.</p>
<p>Additionally, as ""Footprints"" is a WWII period piece, we need a budget for costumes, set and props. Though 100% period realism is unrealistic for us, to illustrate the danger of the same-sex relationship in the piece, the setting must be real enough to place our audience in the right state of mind. </p>
<p>We will be recognizing and thanking everyone who donates in our show's program, and you will have our eternal love and gratitude!</p>
<p>For those who can afford to give in somewhat greater amounts, we'll be reserving spots for the first four high-bidders to have a mentioned character in the show named after them! How cool is that?! Additionally, anyone donating $100 or more will be happily granted two complimentary tickets. We wish we could do more comps for our donors, but we also rely heavily on our ticket sales to fund our entrance fees. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your generous donations are helping to produce a piece of theatre that is ultimately about self-acceptance, the pain of repression, and how much two people can truly mean to one another. Each donation helps us construct the world of the show so we can get our message across with a clear, passionate voice.</p>
<p>Also, can you imagine how awesome the very first investors in a fledgling production of ""Les Miserables"" must feel about themselves today? That could be YOU!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I realize that many of you aren't able to donate, but you too can help our cause! Please share this campaign with anyone who believes in the social and political power of storytelling!</p>
<p>And of course, you can help us get our audience! Talk us up, and of course bring all your friends to see us this summer in the Nanaimo and Victoria Fringe Festivals!</p>
<p>Thank you all so much!</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Shalom! My name is Aaron M. Davidson and I’m a Chicago-based theater artist and musician, spending the past 10 years working professionally across the country as an AEA (Actors Equity Association) actor. </p>
<p>My writing partner Reace Daniel and I wrote an original TYA (Theater for Young Audiences) musical and we are asking for your help to bring this project to its next step!</p>
<p>Reace and I met in the spring of 2017 as actors in a show in Colorado. After spending a lunch break talking about our passion for professional children's theater and our desire to write an original story for the next generation, Reace came back the next day with 20 pages. He exclaimed, ""I don't know what the hell happened last night, but I couldn't stop writing and this came out!"" The next day I wrote the first song and <i>Watercolors </i>was officially born.</p>
<p>After a year of writing, <i>Watercolors </i>is ready for workshopping- that’s where you come in!     </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are asking for $4,200 towards two very important steps in our process: </p>
<ul><li>Music Notation and Orchestration: $2,000-$2,500 </li></ul>
<p>As a composer I can write the music and make the demos, but I don’t have the polished skill of creating fully notated sheet music/charts to give actors and musicians. I am working alongside a top orchestrator in Chicago to make this happen. They are a joy to work with and highly skilled, but they are not cheap! I'm talking a rate of $75/hour. </p>
<ul><li>Week-long Workshop Process/Performance: $2,000-$2,500</li></ul>
<p>This is the really exciting step for me. This is where we get to hear and see the words and notes performed. This process allows Reace and I to watch and listen to what we have written, to learn what works and what doesn't. It will allow us to invite industry professionals as well as potential producers to view a well-executed presentation. Most importantly, we will have an additional presentation for a group of children to get their feedback, a step that other TYA seldom takes. </p>
<p>This will entail...</p>

<li>One music director</li>
<li>One stage manager</li>
<li>Performace space</li>
<li>Rehearsal space</li>
<li>Printing capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>We are committed to paying respectable wages for all artists in this workshop. With the minimum pay for an AEA actor between $125-$225 (depending on the final schedule), you can see how it all adds up quickly. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We hope to affect the hearts of those that battle feeling left out and alone each day because of discrimination. The TYA community is one that can grow and flourish with new visions. Your support means championing the work of an emerging writing team, bringing our original voice to the stage with a unique sound. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you aren't in a place to donate that is okay! Share this campaign on social media so we can get the word out. Get someone in your circle to donate!</p>

After a year of writing, Watercolors is ready for workshopping- that’s where you come in!     
What We Need & What You Get
We are asking for $4,200 towards two very important steps in our process: 
Music Notation and Orchestration: $2,000-$2,500 
As a composer I can write the music and make the demos, but I don’t have the polished skill of creating fully notated sheet music/charts to give actors and musicians. I am working alongside a top orchestrator in Chicago to make this happen. They are a joy to work with and highly skilled, but they are not cheap! I'm talking a rate of $75/hour.

This process allows Reace and I to watch and listen to what we have written, to learn what works and what doesn't. It will allow us to invite industry professionals as well as potential producers to view a well-executed presentation. Most importantly, we will have an additional presentation for a group of children to get their feedback, a step that other TYA seldom takes. 
This will entail...

Six actors
One director
One music director
One stage manager
Performace space
Rehearsal space
Printing capabilities

We are committed to paying respectable wages for all artists in this workshop. With the minimum pay for an AEA actor between $125-$225 (depending on the final schedule), you can see how it all adds up quickly. 
The Impact
We hope to affect the hearts of those that battle feeling left out and alone each day because of discrimination. The TYA community is one that can grow and flourish with new visions.

<p>I started dancing at 5, and haven't stopped since. In the passing years, my passion for the arts, as well as my desire to help people engage with the arts, has only strengthened.

<p>Georgetown has not been a destination for the performing arts, and that is what I would like to change with the creation of Yaw Theater.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Rick Reischman and I've been an actor since High School.  Beyond Therapy is my favorite play, and Bruce has always been a dream role for me, so that's why I'm putting it on for Long Beach Playhouse's Collaborative Season.  The Collaborative Season is a way for independent companies like mine to put on shows using the upstairs studio stage, but we have to provide all of our own funding.  I'm trying to raise some money to cover the cost of the production to put on the best show that we can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $2,000.00 to cover the basics for this campaign.  Your contribution will help us with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building the set including furniture and set dressing</li>
<li>Provide scripts for the cast </li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Props</li>
<li>Rights for the show</li>
<li>Theater Rental Space</li>
<li>Advertising materials such as posters, flyers and postcards</li>
<li>Programs for the audience</li>
</ul>
<p>We are an amateur theater company, which means we can't offer pay.  However if we raise enough money, we may be able to offer compensation for our actors, director and crew.</p>
<p>What do you get in return?  You'll get a great (we hope) show!  The best way to support the show is to come and see it.  Tickets are available now on the Long Beach Playhouse's Website!  Get them here for:</p>

<p>If you can't go to the show, but still want to support it with money, consider one of our perks!  We have several perks available and may even include some special surprises for higher tiers.  You'll get your name in our program and special thanks from the cast and crew and maybe even some signed photos.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our funding goal, don't worry.  We will still get whatever was donated to us.  All funds will go towards funding the production with the rest contributed by me.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is the first time even attempting to produce my own play, so your help will be invaluable.  If this is succesful, we may continue to produce plays even producing some of my own unpublished work.  Your contribution will really make this dream a reality, and you'll get to say you are a patron of the arts.  Who doesn't want that?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Putting on your own show can be expensive, but we are looking to keep costs low so we can put on the best show that we can for the least amount of money.  Independently producing a show can also result in low turnout.  We hope you can help be spreading the word, but financially getting some advertising on social media as well as flyers, posters and postcards will help also.</p>
<p>I've had some success with producing my own short films, and plan on using other talented people in helping me to put this on.  I'm building a team to make this the best possible show we can do.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, I completely understand, but you can still help in other ways.  Pass this along to your friends and family and ask them to contribute, or just tell everyone about our play and ask them to come and see it!  Hand out flyers, or post cards, or email or call people.  There are a number of ways you can help get the word out, and believe me, we can use the help!</p>

But their all-girl Catholic school has other ideas. Disbanded and reprimanded, the group has a choice: do they bow down, retreat, and let the school rules divide them? Or, through all the angsty mess of adolescence, do they unite and fight back to make a change?The show started in 2018 when writers Meg McGrady and Zoe Morris met at musical theatre writing course, Book, Music and Lyrics (BML). Since then, the show has won awards, been featured on musical theatre podcasts, performed at The Other Palace and gained over 45,000 TikTok followers. With two young people writing the show we’ve found many young people relate to the show and the topics it discusses like growing up and finding your identity. We also want this show to help parents, guardians, teachers and friends to understand the thoughts and experiences that young people go through during the turbulent times of adolescence.  The Phase is a coming of age story that everyone can enjoy, filled with catchy pop songs that you won’t be able to get out of your head! A hugely exciting piece of new British musical theatre written by two upcoming, award-winning writers.We are raising money to support the development of The Phase with a workshop taking place in October 2020.  After several read-throughs to help finesse the script and songs, this workshop is a wonderful opportunity to get the show on its feet and explore how the show will stylistically look on stage. It will also give us an opportunity to show what we have to a small, invited, socially distanced, audience including  industry professionals, prospective venues and investors.  We need your help to put this workshop on so we can pay all respective performers, creatives, band members and to hire a rehearsal space. More details about the budget are shown further down. Every pound you contribute allows us to embark on this musical adventure together, with the ultimate goal of putting the show on at the Edinburgh Fringe 2021. We’ll keep you updated on how the show is progressing through and after the workshop. As a backer we guarantee that you’ll feel informed and empowered to be a part of this musical journey. We really feel that this is only the beginning of something really special!The show started as a passion project but has since become something much greater than that! Our 45,000 TikTok followers have proven how timely and important this show is and how so many young people crave to see this musical. With two young people writing the show we’ve found many young people relate to the show and the topics it discusses like growing up and finding your identity. We also want this show to help parents, guardians, teachers and friends to understand the thoughts and experiences that young people go through during the turbulent times of adolescence. By donating to The Phase you'll be helping make this show a reality. The workshop is our next stage in development before we prepare for the Edinburgh Fringe 2021.We pride ourselves in that The Phase is written by a young writing team who have written a wonderfully genuine and authentic story, as it is partly based on their own experiences at school. MEG MCGRADY (MUSIC/LYRICS)Meg (they/them) is a twenty-one-year-old nonbinary composer and performer.

2e événement bénéfice annuel de Danse à la carte






Danse à la carte est une compagnie sans but lucratif dont le mandat est de supporter la communauté de la danse de Montréal. Nous cherchons à favoriser les opportunités professionnelles des danseurs professionnels, tous horizons esthétiques confondus, en les mettant en contact les uns avec les autres, mais également avec des enseignants, des répétiteurs et des chorégraphes établis. En plus d’offrir des classes de haute qualité pour l’entrainement quotidien des danseurs, nous les aidons également à développer des outils professionnels connexes en marketing, communication, gestion et coordination artistique. C’est dans le but d’améliorer nos services et de diversifier nos opérations, afin de répondre toujours plus adéquatement aux besoins de notre communauté, que nous organisons la levée de fonds du 4 septembre prochain.







Danse à la carte supporte l’ensemble de sa communauté par la valorisation de chaque intervenant qui y est investi. Elle est rapidement devenue un vecteur d’échange, établissant un territoire où peuvent naître des collaborations, opportunités professionnelles et projets fertiles. 


Votre contribution sera donc associée à la santé et au développement professionnel de les artistes de notre communauté.

</h3> <p>In 2014, a new group called Penumbra:Exchange was formed with the mission of promoting emerging artists, enhancing diversity, and creating connections with the Boston dance community.  We started with our <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/diversity-in-movement-choreographers-of-color/x/8659930"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Diversity in Movement</a> concert but quickly realized that we needed to do more.  So we invited Chun-jou Tsai aka ""Dream"" to be the first choreographer we produce a solo concert for since she embodies so many of the qualities we strive to support.  Furthermore, her work features a truly racially and culturally diverse cast - something still rarely found in Boston.<br/></p>
<p>The Dream Project is about visualizing a Buddhist poem using traditional Chinese long-sleeves dance with Western improvisational modern dance technique.  This poem, when loosely translated, reflects the sentiments felt by many pursuing any kind of dream: just when you feel the most hopeless and defeated about your hard work is when you have to keep striving towards your goal, like a plum blossom breaking through the first snow of winter.<br/></p>
<p>Just like our previous campaign, we are asking for help with the production costs of this concert.  Unlike the Diversity in Movement concert, however, we will be paying for the costumes, designs, and other costs that most choreographers must normally cover.  In exchange, we promise to contribute a portion of our profits towards an organization whose cause aligns with our own.</p>

<h3>Meet ""Dream""<br/>
</h3>Dream is a native of Taiwan with extensive knowledge of dance 
performance, choreography, education, and acting.  Her prolific career 
includes touring internationally with the Lan Yang Dance Company, 
commercial work as lead actress/dancer in music videos, and performing 
with the Pascal Rioult Dance Company during their summer intensives.  
She has received numerous awards for her choreography and performance 
since 2005 as well as funding to attend the prestigious American Dance 
Festival and Vienna International Dance Festival (ImPulsTanz).  Dream
 accepted a full scholarship in 2010 to attend the Case Western Reserve 
University MFA in Contemporary Dance program where she continued to 
receive accolades for her work.  After coming to Boston in 2013, she joined Urbanity Dance and Penumbra:Movement with performances at 
the Boston University Dance Theatre, Dance Complex, Green Street 
Studios, and Boston Contemporary Dance Festival.  Dream passes on her deep
 knowledge and love of dance to her students each day at the Chinese 
Folk Art Dance Workshop, Bright Pearl Dance Academy, Gia Yung Dance 
Company, and Winchester Wen Chen Dance Group.<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What a Dream Costs and How to Help it Come True<br/>
</h3> <p>These are the total costs of putting on the production:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>$600 - Theater rental for 1-night performance (including tech/dress rehearsals)<br/>
</li> <li>$150 - Costumes for 3 women and 2 men featuring custom <a href=""http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/87Arts1450.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">long-sleeves</a><br/>
</li> <li>$150 - Posters and programs for the audience</li>
<li>$500 - Lighting and video design</li>
<li>$500 - Performance stipends for 5 dancers</li>
<li>$500 - Rehearsal rental fees</li>
<li>$100 - Cost of supplies for perks<br/>
</li>
<li>$100 - Transaction fees if we don't meet our goal (yes, it does add up to that much!)</li>
</ul>
<p>That comes out to $2600 - and we're only asking for $1500. To help reduce the amount that we are asking for from the Indiegogo community, we are pledging to hold a fundraising dance workshop as well as asking for sponsors to advertise in our concert program.<br/></p>
<p>The theater seats about 100 people and our tickets are going for $15 each.  If we are lucky enough to get a full house, we may bring in $1400 after transaction fees and such. <b>The more that is covered by our Indiegogo campaign, the more that we can donate to back to the Boston community.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>About that Plum Blossom...<br/>
</h3>Like anyone else, Dream has her own dream as well.  In 2010, she came to the US to further her studies in contemporary dance as a graduate student at Case Western Reserve University.  As part of the program, they give their foreign MFA graduates a one-year work visa in the US before they must apply for a sponsored visa that must be renewed each year.  For most dancers in the US, it is tricky to find an employer that will agree to this.  Dream currently has one more year before she must find another sponsor or switch to different visa enabling her to work as a freelance artist.<br/><br/>What the average American citizen doesn't know is that in order for a foreigner to work in the US as a non-sponsored freelance artist, they must apply for a special visa.  In the application, they must show evidence of a high-level of expertise and many accomplishments in their field.  A 'Nobel Prize' is listed as an actual example on the US government website. This is a far cry from how immigrants are typically described in news media and popular culture. Most US-born artists would have a hard time meeting the requirements outlined for foreign-born artists seeking to work as a freelancer.  This concert would help demonstrate that Dream meets the requirements that the US government is asking of her.<br/><br/>Dream came to Boston because of her close relationship with her aunts and uncles. Her ""family"" has expanded to include all the students she teaches around Boston, Urbanity Dance artists, and many others.  On top of that, she is one of very few artists in Boston currently merging Asian traditional dance with Western contemporary forms.  To see that kind of dance elsewhere requires going to a place like New York City or Los Angeles.  So Dream's departure would also mean a big loss for Boston.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Pushing through the Snow<br/>
</h3>We know that we are risking a lot and putting in great effort for something that might not pan out.  But just like the Buddhist poem says, you can't achieve your goal without ""pushing through the snow""  What we learn this time around can only help us do better, whether in helping Dream demonstrate expertise, helping another artist achieve their goals, or finding more sources for funding future Penumbra:Exchange productions.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Perhaps you would like to help but don't have a lot of cash? Or maybe you don't feel comfortable donating through Indiegogo?  Here are some options to consider:<br/><ul>
<li>Volunteer as a stage crew member or usher!</li>
<li>Attend our fundraiser on Saturday, Dec. 6 by taking a 7pm class to learn choreography from the show</li>
<li>Contact penumbra.rme@gmail.com to place an ad in our program</li>

This project is very important to me because I truly believe that people will enjoy this play. I am asking for $50,000 which will cover props, sovenirs, paying for space and paying a quality cast. I have perks for different amounts of support. For $10, supporters receive a fraternity t-shirt. For $50, supporters receive a t-shirt and the video. For $50, supporters receive the t-shirt, the video and free tickets for the stage performance. Please help in making this excellent play a reality. I thank you for any amount of support that you can give.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Greetings from the Professor</h3>
<p><span>Hello! I am Professor Horatio Octavious Algernon, time-traveling cryptoarcheologist ans Steampunk.  For more than 20 years, I have been inviting people to join me in the world of steampunk with eye-catching performances, inventions, and magic.  Along with my personal zombie, Olivia Nevermore, I take audiences through time and demonstrate <span>wonders that man has forgotten and shamanistic rituals they wish they could forget! </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I take great joy and pride in bringing laughter and fun to adults and children alike, and have been invited to bring my ""World of Oddities and Wonders"" to UtopiaCon in Cincinnati, Ohio, in October 2012.  To do this, however, I need your help.  To get our show from California to Ohio, we will need to rent an RV capable of hauling our crew and prop trailer on a 5000 mile trip. </span></span></p>
<p>Not only will your contribution get us to the biggest gig of our respective careers, but you will be launching our show from regional to national exposure and acclaim.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The List</h3>
<p>To make this trip happen, I need $8,500.  Here's how it breaks down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cruise America Large RV rental: $3000</li>
<li>Covered UHaul trailer: $400</li>
<li>13, 55-gallon tanks of gas (7 miles/gallon while towing) at about $4.50/gallon: $3300</li>
<li>Two weeks of meals for five people, cooking and eating out: $800</li>
<li>Hotel rooms at UtopiaCon: $1000</li>
<li>TOTAL:  $8,500</li>
</ul>
<div>These figures are rough estimates, based on current prices.  No matter how you calculate it, though, this is an expensive trip.  By helping us accomplish this, you will be an invaluable part of helping me realize a lifelong dream:  being a full-time, self-supporting performing magician, one that can actually pay a crew AND keep the lights on at the same time.  (Believe me, my wife will eternally love you, and, more importantly, me, if you help me do this...)</div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If we do not make our goal, all monies raised will be put in the ""UtopiaCon or Bust!"" bank account and be used, in conjunction with car washes and other fund raisers, to get us, by hook or by crook, to Cincinatti.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>The following contributions come with perks...little tchochkes and trinkets to forever remember how you helped change our lives:</div>
<div> </div>

<ul>
<li>$10 - A very steampunky, Professor Algernon pin</li>

<li>$100 - A very steampunky, Professor Algernon pin AND a signed photo postcard of the Professor and Olivia AND a Professor Algernon T-shirt AND a DVD of the UtopiaCon trip and show</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Your Support Will Do</h3>
<p>Why is this so important, to me and to others?  Here are just a few things</p>
<ul>
<li>UtopiaCon is counting on our presence; we're a major steampunk headliner this year! (Check it out at <a href=""http://www.utopiacon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.utopiacon.com</a>)</li>
<li>The exposure of this particular show will open the doors to other major performances.  </li>

the middle of an exciting rehearsal process for our workshop production of The
Lost Light, a new music theater show for adults and children.  The
Lost Light follows Penny, a quirky imaginative little girl, on her journey

In our show, sections of their prose were presented in various spoken word art styles. Text co-mingled with student music compositions. Cello, guitar, beat boxing and improvisational vocalizing were all part of the soundscape. An extremely physical piece of theatre, each scene came to life with the performers' movement.

<h1><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Naked In Alaska:</span></h1>
<h2>The True Story of Stripping in the Last Frontier</h2>
<p>My name is Valerie Hager. I was inspired to write and perform <em>Naked In Alaska</em> after I moved to New York City from Los Angeles and began to go through dozens of old journals and hundreds of photographs that I had been carrying around with me for over a decade. As I sat in my empty apartment, I suddenly saw this young girl who I'd forgotten about. This girl who had been ashamed of her body, addicted to drugs, longing to be loved, and yet doing everything she could to push the world away.</p>
<p>And I realized that in having separated myself from her and judged her as bad and wrong, I had also forgotten and abandoned the rebel in me--that untamed part that had been determined to pave her own path in the world and feel alive.</p>
<p>So I began to turn these experiences I had as a young girl into short performances pieces. I knew that if I had had these types of experiences, other women (and men) must have as well. And didn't want anyone else to feel as alone as I did in those experiences. I wanted to shine a light on all of it and let people know that all of it matters, can be made beautiful, and doesn't have to be shut away in the dark. This is how <em>Naked In Alaska</em> was born.</p>
<p>Now <em>Naked In Alaska</em> has been invited to two of the most well-regarded theatre festivals in the United States: the 2013 International New York Fringe Festival in August and the 2013 Chicago Fringe Festival in September. We--myself and the show's director, Scott Wesley Slavin--are incredibly grateful to have been chosen to be part of these festivals and now we need your help to make it happen!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Valerie Hager in Naked In Alaska"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.valeriehager.com/NakedInAlaska/gallery/IMG_8003.JPG"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 165px; margin-right: 165px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>""Where has Naked In Alaska been so far?""</h2>
<p><em>Naked In Alaska</em> premiered to two sold-out houses at the Women at Work Festival in September-October 2012 and was the bestseller at the EstroGenius Festival in November 2012. In April of this year, <em>Naked In Alaska</em> performed to a full house at Dixon Place, an Obie Award winning New York City theater devoted exclusively to presenting original work.</p>
<p>The feedback from audience members and press alike has been outstanding and we have been humbled by the amount of support and encouragement we have received from everyone who has experienced the show.</p>
<h3>Selected Past Reviews:</h3>
<p><em>""Utilizing much humor and some very impressive pole dancing, the story unfolds as Valerie combines vulnerability and honesty with the survival skills needed to navigate the murky world of strip clubs and private party rooms. The ability to laugh at herself only enhances her charm. You will root for her indomitable spirit and celebrate the triumph of Valerie Hager in Naked In Alaska."" -- Laurie Lawson, Theatre Critic, Off-Broadway</em></p>
<p><em>""Valerie Hager is the real deal: stunningly beautiful and even more stunningly talented. Evocative characterizations and a compelling personal story combined in a finely executed piece of theatre. Go, just go."" -- Jen Thatcher, Producer, EstroGenius Festival</em></p>
<p><em>""As a performer, Valerie is luminous. As a writer, she is fearless. Naked In Alaska highlights her talents in both fields, and the result is theater that is equal parts gut wrenching and inspiring - in other words: theater that is not to be missed."" -- Molly Pearson, Co-Artistic Director, Partial Comfort Productions </em></p>
<p><em>""By the end of the show I told myself, 'Get as many people as you can to see this show.' I think that may be one of the best one woman shows I've ever seen… because your show is so dangerous. I loved every minute of it!"" -- Adam Delia, Writer/Director/Producer, Bryan and Kim</em></p>

<h2>""What kind of support do you need?""</h2>
<p>Participating in two major Fringe festivals in the same summer is a major undertaking--financially and energetically. We are fiercely committed to <em>Naked In Alaska's</em> success at both festivals and far beyond! With your help, <em>Naked In Alaska</em> can reach the audiences that could most benefit by seeing it and sharing it with others. We need help paying for:</p>
<p>- Festival Entry fees<br/>- Marketing and publicity<br/>- Rehearsal space<br/>- Technical staff and stage managers<br/>- Travel to and from Chicago (and prop transportation)</p>
<p>We need to raise the entire amount! You'll receive cool perks for donating and <em>Naked In Alaska</em> is sponsored by Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts organization--so your donations are 100% tax-deductible. If we can make this happen, <em>Naked In Alaska</em> has the chance to inspire women and young girls to make choices to honor themselves in ways that can change the course of their life.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>""What if you exceed your funding goal?""</h2>
<p>If we exceed our fundraising goal (yay!), we can fulfill our dream of bringing <em>Naked In Alaska</em> to our home state of California! We look forward to touring it around the U.S. and reaching as many people as possible. Additionally, we very much seek to expand opportunities around every performance to include writing and storytelling workshops, artist Q&amp;As, and local outreach.</p>
<p> </p>

Naked In Alaska:
The True Story of Stripping in the Last Frontier
My name is Valerie Hager. I was inspired to write and perform Naked In Alaska after I moved to New York City from Los Angeles and began to go through dozens of old journals and hundreds of photographs that I had been carrying around with me for over a decade. As I sat in my empty apartment, I suddenly saw this young girl who I'd forgotten about. This girl who had been ashamed of her body, addicted to drugs, longing to be loved, and yet doing everything she could to push the world away.
And I realized that in having separated myself from her and judged her as bad and wrong, I had also forgotten and abandoned the rebel in me--that untamed part that had been determined to pave her own path in the world and feel alive.
So I began to turn these experiences I had as a young girl into short performances pieces. I knew that if I had had these types of experiences, other women (and men) must have as well. And didn't want anyone else to feel as alone as I did in those experiences. I wanted to shine a light on all of it and let people know that all of it matters, can be made beautiful, and doesn't have to be shut away in the dark. This is how Naked In Alaska was born.
Now Naked In Alaska has been invited to two of the most well-regarded theatre festivals in the United States: the 2013 International New York Fringe Festival in August and the 2013 Chicago Fringe Festival in September. We--myself and the show's director, Scott Wesley Slavin--are incredibly grateful to have been chosen to be part of these festivals and now we need your help to make it happen!
 

 
""Where has Naked In Alaska been so far?""
Naked In Alaska premiered to two sold-out houses at the Women at Work Festival in September-October 2012 and was the bestseller at the EstroGenius Festival in November 2012. In April of this year, Naked In Alaska performed to a full house at Dixon Place, an Obie Award winning New York City theater devoted exclusively to presenting original work.
The feedback from audience members and press alike has been outstanding and we have been humbled by the amount of support and encouragement we have received from everyone who has experienced the show.
Selected Past Reviews:
""Utilizing much humor and some very impressive pole dancing, the story unfolds as Valerie combines vulnerability and honesty with the survival skills needed to navigate the murky world of strip clubs and private party rooms. The ability to laugh at herself only enhances her charm. You will root for her indomitable spirit and celebrate the triumph of Valerie Hager in Naked In Alaska."" -- Laurie Lawson, Theatre Critic, Off-Broadway
""Valerie Hager is the real deal: stunningly beautiful and even more stunningly talented. Evocative characterizations and a compelling personal story combined in a finely executed piece of theatre. Go, just go."" -- Jen Thatcher, Producer, EstroGenius Festival
""As a performer, Valerie is luminous. As a writer, she is fearless. Naked In Alaska highlights her talents in both fields, and the result is theater that is equal parts gut wrenching and inspiring - in other words: theater that is not to be missed."" -- Molly Pearson, Co-Artistic Director, Partial Comfort Productions 
""By the end of the show I told myself, 'Get as many people as you can to see this show.' I think that may be one of the best one woman shows I've ever seen… because your show is so dangerous. I loved every minute of it!"" -- Adam Delia, Writer/Director/Producer, Bryan and Kim

""What kind of support do you need?""
Participating in two major Fringe festivals in the same summer is a major undertaking--financially and energetically. We are fiercely committed to Naked In Alaska's success at both festivals and far beyond! With your help, Naked In Alaska can reach the audiences that could most benefit by seeing it and sharing it with others. We need help paying for:
- Festival Entry fees- Marketing and publicity- Rehearsal space- Technical staff and stage managers- Travel to and from Chicago (and prop transportation)
We need to raise the entire amount! You'll receive cool perks for donating and Naked In Alaska is sponsored by Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts organization--so your donations are 100% tax-deductible. If we can make this happen, Naked In Alaska has the chance to inspire women and young girls to make choices to honor themselves in ways that can change the course of their life.
 
""What if you exceed your funding goal?""
If we exceed our fundraising goal (yay!), we can fulfill our dream of bringing Naked In Alaska to our home state of California! We look forward to touring it around the U.S. and reaching as many people as possible. Additionally, we very much seek to expand opportunities around every performance to include writing and storytelling workshops, artist Q&As, and local outreach.
 
""And how else can I help?""
Please help us spread the word! Please forward this campaign to your friends, family, and networks. Feel free to reach out to me via email, connect with me on Facebook, and follow me on Twitter. Please use the IndieGogo Share Tools below and let's get the word out to as many people as we can! Thank you for your help!
 
Thank you!!!
To everyone who has taken the time to visit this page and learn more about Naked In Alaska--THANK YOU!
To the Indiegogo community who continues to inspire me everyday--THANK YOU for considering my campaign and supporting Naked In Alaska!
I will continue do everything in my power to present Naked In Alaska as a vehicle to inspire and open up honest and courageous conversations so that lives may be changed wherever it goes!

They keep us going. When we (Luke and Hayley) got together to talk about creating a children's show for the 2013 Toronto Fringe, we talked about telling good stories. After assembling a crack team of actors, designers and director, we put together a collectively-created script, and now sit ready to produce what is sure to be a hit at the Fringe this summer: <em>Honest Aesop's Fables. </em></p>
<p>Based on centuries-old fables, <em>Honest Aesop's Fables </em>is a modern retelling of some of the best known stories from our childhood: The Tortoise and the Hare, The Ants and Grasshoppers are just a few. Working with all the stories we could find, we narrowed it down to our favourites, and then honed them into a quick-witted and physically active show that is entertaining while also teaching important lessons about life and living well.</p>

<h3>A <em>Hare</em>-Raising Tale</h3>
<p>Fringe Festivals return all the ticket money to artists. Because of that, Fringe productions often operate on a profit-share model, where all the expenses of the show are paid, and then everything that's left is split fairly between the people who worked on the show.</p>
<p>What we're trying to do with this campaign is help tip the equation in favour of the 10 artists who are working on <em>Honest Aesop's Fables</em>. We're hoping to raise enough money now to cover the cost of our production, so that every penny of our ticket sales goes straight into the pockets of our artists - actors, director, designers, stage manager. But who are these lovely people? Check out these gorgeous headshots!</p>

 There was another Mozart - a forgotten genius, an other Mozart.THE OTHER MOZART is the true and untold story of Nannerl Mozart, the sister of Amadeus - a prodigy, keyboard virtuoso and composer, who performed throughout Europe with her brother to equal acclaim, but her work and her story faded away, lost to history.  In 2006 performer and musician, Sylvia Milo, found Nannerl in the Mozart family portrait, and this project started.Set in and on a sweeping 18-foot dress (designed by Magdalena Dabrowska from the National Theater of Poland), directed by Isaac Byrne, the play is based on facts, stories and lines pulled directly from the Mozart family's humorous and heartbreaking letters. Along with music composed by her famous brother and Marianna Martines (a female composer who inspired Nannerl), original music was written for the play by Nathan Davis and Phyllis Chen (of Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival and the International Contemporary Ensemble) using clavichords, music boxes, teacups, and fans.In a world still unequal in opportunities for women, it is necessary to hear and understand stories such as Nannerl’s.We feel compelled to bring Nannerl’s story to as wide an audience as possible - after critically acclaimed, sold out performances at festivals around the US and in Austria, we present the play for the first time as a full, three-week (24 performances), theatrical run:HERE Arts Center, NYC  - June 22 - July 12(Opening Night and party: June 25)We need your help in raising the necessary funds to make this happen.Amadeus was able to become the first successful freelance composer by taking matters into his own hands: “Wolfgang has arranged for a list of subscribers - including many members of high aristocracy - for whom he gives concerts. He rents a concert hall, even brings his own fortepiano, and performs his music for their pleasure and their pay.” 
Nannerl was not able to do that, but now we can do it for her.You have a chance to become a member of high aristocracy for Nannerl Mozart! WHAT IT ACTUALLY COSTSThe 3-week run (24 performances) at this Off-Broadway theater will cost over $20,000.  What it breaks down into is: the (subsidized*) cost of the theater -$4500/weekrehearsal space (ten 5-hour rehearsals for Sylvia and Julia - the understudy) - $1000insurance - $500extra lights rental - $500fireproofing the dress - $300marketing and PR - $3500postcards, posters, postage, printing of programs - $1000 That is already over $20,000... and we still need some artist/crew fees, some new tea cups and bloomers!IT IS TAX DEDUCTIBLE!The Other Mozart is the first project by Little Matchstick Factory - Sylvia Milo's and Nathan Davis' theater production company.

</div></div>","Our Story

b current Performing Arts and Theatre Archipelago are two 
independent theatre companies in Toronto who have come together to stage
 the world premiere of Nicole Brooks' Obeah Opera. This Caribbean
 themed opera is sung entirely a capella (just voice, no musical 
instruments) by 5 leads and a chorus of 10 women.b current has been developing Obeah Opera for
 the last four years;  the full premiere production is February 16 to 
March 4 at the 918 Bathurst Centre for Culture, as part of the Black 
History Month festivities in Toronto.
Set in the late 17th century, Obeah Opera tells a
 story of women silenced by the most infamous 'witch-hunt' in history. 
Tituba and a handful of Caribbean women imported as slaves into 
the American colony of Salem are arrested and accused of practicing obeah! A healing art seen only as blasphemy and witchcraft through the eyes of the local Puritans.We follow Tituba in the days before her capture, her incarceration, and her stand on trial in this uplifting operatic journey. Obeah Opera explodes myths surrounding the Salem Witch Trials, unravels the branding of obeah with
 evil and witchery through tying it back to its true spiritual nature 
rooted in West Africa, and finally, it gives voice to a group of women 
whose story has been missing from history.

We
 have raised some of the money needed through public funding but have 
fallen drastically short on the private and corporate funding support; 
even after continuously scaling back the size of our budget
 for the last three months but still aiming for cutting edge production 
aesthetics. With a top notch cast and crew, signed up to 
work on this ground breaking opera for way less than what they are 
worth, we see no more possible budget cuts. So, we are setting a 30-day challenge to raise $10,000 between now and opening night.
The Impact 
Musicals are popular, and many people who don't usually attend live theatre go to see commercial musicals as a once-in-a-while night out. Obeah Opera is steeped in centuries of black music, and will definitely satisfy this once-in-a-while musical desire. Plus the subject matter will resonate and allow both casual and regular theatre audiences to enjoy ruminating well after watching. The show also affirms Caribbean cultural pride for the cast, crew and audiences alike! 

From early showcasing of Obeah Opera, audiences have been extremely excited. The anticipation was palpable during the 10th rock.paper.sistahz
 Festival where a final previewing was filled beyond capacity (and 
another 20-30 people turned away for lack of standing room!). Feedback 
from audience members ranges from:

â€œThe most profound piece of theatre I have seen in yearsâ€ to â€œA fantastic odysseyâ€

And, â€œ[It] speaks directly to my own backgroundâ€¦â€ & â€œCanâ€™t wait for the production""

 


While our box office revenue is a conservative 
projection, we cannot depend on this as a huge income stream. Your 
donation can help us to break even. Keeping us out of debt will allow us
 to  mount Obeah Opera and be in a good position to handle future new productions too.  



 

What We Need & What You Get 





We need to raise $10,000 in 40 days. With the funds we raise on indiegogo, we will offset any potential deficit. No amount is too small, and every dollar will go towards paying an actor, a designer or a stage crew. Your contribution gives us the peace of mind that come closing night we will be able to meet all our financial commitments for this production. You get our thanks in the way of your name listed as a sponsor, a special customized gift,  and everyone who donates can receive a charitable receipt for contributing!

It was illustrated by a close friend and colleague, Sue Ellen Mathers.With your help I now begin a Campaign to turn this delightful story into a series of readings and a stage-play. Long-range plans are to produce a professionally animated version for download, purchase or broadcast. Longer-range plans include making it a musical.What is special about this Christmas Story, beside the fun and twists?  It's New. It's Wholesome. Children, teens and adults may be cast in the play not to mention Santa and the Tooth Fairy.  There are lessons to be learned about helping in an emergency and not being afraid to take risks. It also offers parents and pediatric dentists an opportunity to spread the word about the essential need for the care of teeth, especially in children. One in five kids in the USA have cavities that go untreated, which may cause more problems and serious health issues. From the ScriptAct II, Scene I. (Up On the Roof Top the 8 Reindeer are dancing and prancing in place, jingling their bells and singing, until Dasher turns and sees the Tooth Fairy).Dasher: Oh boy Dancer, we've got problems; there's a fairy on the chimney with the old man's bag of toys. Not good. Not good! Dancer: Whow everyone. Hold it! There's a problem.(The Reindeer stop, except Cupid who is oblivious; the rest look toward Dasher then back at the chimney)Dasher: It's goin' to be OK. I'm the lead pony tonight; I'll trot over and see what's up.Dancer: You're not a pony; how many times has Santa told you that?The rest of the Reindeer: Yeah, you're not a pony, we are Reindeer, Santa's Reindeer!Dasher: I don't care. I trot like a pony and my cousin is a horse. Just watch my back.Dancer: All right, all right. Go. We've got a time-crunch. (He unhooks Dasher and bumps him over toward the chimney. Dasher struts and swaggers his way toward the Tooth Fairy.)Tooth Fairy (Flustered, muttering and dusting off her dress, coils when she sees Dasher and puts her hands up to keep him at a distance): Stay, stay, I'm just filling in. Santa's... What has been accomplished already:
The play has been written.
The original storybook has been published.
The story has been registered with the Writer's Guild of the West.
The play has been reviewed with comments by a veteran stage actress and director.
Hollywood Actress Jennifer Laks will read as the Tooth Fairy. 
A few other actors have been chosen to read other parts for the series of readings.
A theater will be chosen for the first reading in Los Angeles; and another in Santa Barbara.
2014 Spring dates are being chosen for the readings.
Research into possible venues/theaters for the full production are beginning.
A list of potential Sponsors is being developed for full play production.
What must happen next:
The play must be finalized for readings, casting, distriution.
Invitations and advertising for the readings will be sent.
Rehersals for the readings to be scheduled.
All venues and dates for readings finalized.
More books need to be purchased for marketing, outreach and donors.
A Director, theater and cast must be secured for the production.
Dates must be finalized for a production.
Sponsors must be found for parties and underwriting final production.
Appropriate music must be found for background (this is not a musical (however, it lends itself to one in the future).
Goal I - $ 500 Print more copies of the storybook for marketing and PR.Goal 2 - $1,500Finalize and print the play for distribution, casting, rehersals and readings.Goal 2- $ $2,500Create a website, brochure for marketing and PR in print and on-line.Goal 4 - $ 3,500 Readings and Parties.Produce two readings in Los Angeles and one in Santa Barbara.Find a director, cast and a theater for full production. Identify an organization to receive a % of net-revenue from the production of the play to promote pediatric dental care.Goal 5- $26,000Produce the Play in a theater. Your Benefit.You are part of a new story for children and family entertainment. This project and play have been accepted by a 501(c) Non-profit arts-mentoring organization as its fiscal receiver.Your donations are tax deductable to the extent of the tax laws. You will also be helping to spread the word on the need for pediatric dental care.The Impact.This fun-filled story is destined to become a new Children's Christmas Classic, by stage and animation. It has great potential to create awareness about the need for pedatric dental care. Each child who attends the play will receive a dental care package.Other Ways You Can Help.Offer contacts for dentist, pediatric associations, actors, animator or theater groups or any corporation that might like the connection and publicity.

We need a venue, set, lighting, sound and marketing.  We will size the production accordingly, but we are eager to reserve a venue that seats 500 and plan on running up to 4 shows....so we want to presell as many tickets as possible!
Approximately 25% of all profits going to War Child http://www.warchild.org/ to help support children in conflict zones today.
Other Ways You Can HelpWe are wide open for sponsors
We are wide open for sponsors (both private and corporate).

Cross-collaborations such as this provide WHYTEBERG immersive insight into the creative workings of other companies as well as inspiration from a new city and different dancers. It provides Project Flux a skeleton for both companies to work within, culminating in a unique experience, which is situationally specific for company members and local audience members alike.  The skeletal concept and the opportunity to build anew on that armature is what makes this project forward-thinking and transferable. This is a new kind of residency we are interested in pursuing across the US and this residency with Project Flux is the first step in making this new kind of collaborative work possible.</p><p>The residency would include a weeklong Research and Development phase in which WHYTEBERG dancers and Project Flux dancers would rehearse to create new sections based on dancers’ memories and find corresponding local spaces in Boise for these sections.

<div>Hi. After several years in the theatre supporting other performers and creators such as <b>Elaine Stritch</b> (<i>Elaine Stritch At Liberty</i>) and <b>Tommy Tune</b> - and years of deep, personal inner growth work - I am prepared to present my first full-length solo show. I've spent years in a deep soul-searching journey using symbols, myths and ritual to awaken my inner creative self. After previous unsuccessful attempts to tell my biographical story through screenplays  and novels I now have a complete 90-minute script. </div>
<div>Classes in writing and performing have helped me shape my script and for the debut performance I am working with director <b>Abby Lorenz</b> who studied with <b>Ann Randolph</b> (<i>Squeeze Box</i>, <i>Loveland</i>).</div>
<div>This performance represents a major achievement for me personally, as well as the threshold to a future of ""taking this show on the road"" with future bookings.</div>

Hi. After several years in the theatre supporting other performers and creators such as Elaine Stritch (Elaine Stritch At Liberty) and Tommy Tune - and years of deep, personal inner growth work - I am prepared to present my first full-length solo show. I've spent years in a deep soul-searching journey using symbols, myths and ritual to awaken my inner creative self. After previous unsuccessful attempts to tell my biographical story through screenplays  and novels I now have a complete 90-minute script. 
Classes in writing and performing have helped me shape my script and for the debut performance I am working with director Abby Lorenz who studied with Ann Randolph (Squeeze Box, Loveland).
This performance represents a major achievement for me personally, as well as the threshold to a future of ""taking this show on the road"" with future bookings.
By contributing, you will ensure the successful support I need to be on that stage alone - allowing my creativity to be uninhibited by concerns for money, staff, and presentation.   $2,500 - Phase 1   $800 for two-day hall rental.

<h3>We are Submersive Productions</h3>
<p>Submersive Productions is a collaborative artworks company that combines artistic disciplines to create memorable and profound audience experiences. We strive to activate unused, underused or unusual spaces in Baltimore, engage local talent, and compensate artists for their work.</p>
<p>We are passionate about our city and the amazing, creative humans that dwell in it. We believe in the power of immersive theater to connect people and ask bold questions, and we want to make Baltimore a center for such artworks.</p>
<p>With our exciting new project, <i>H.T. Darling's Incredible Musaeum presents: The Treasures of New Galapagos, Astonishing Acquisitions from the Perisphere, </i>we will create a truly unique world for visitors to explore, bring life to an architectural gem, and reach out to new audiences. Alongside our talented collaborators of performing artists, visual artists, designers and fabricators, this is the biggest, wildest project we have ever undertaken. Did we mention that there will be puppets?</p>
<h3>We're Asking for Your Help</h3>
<p>We need to raise $18,000 to help make this production a reality. We want to be clear - this is only about 30% of the budget needed for such a large show. The remaining monies will come from grants, ticket sales, and in-kind donations. Here's how we would spend the $18,000 that we are requesting here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying our Cast, Crew and Creative Team for their contributions to the work. (50%)</li>
<li>Purchasing materials necessary for building the sets, props, costumes and puppets that will create the rich texture of this world. (30%)</li>
<li>Renting and/or purchasing lighting and audio equipment. (15%)</li>
<li>Covering the costs of marketing materials and programs, including printing. (5%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever your donation, we want to give <i>you</i> something in return. We've got a terrific array of perks, from personal thank-yous, to advance notice of ticket sales, to dinner with the Cast, Crew and Creative Team. And here's some really exciting news: <strong>if we exceed our goal by just $750, we can open up an additional floor of the building! </strong></p>
<p>Any contribution you make is tax-deductible.<i> Musaeum</i> is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-­profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of <i>Musaeum</i> must be made payable to “Fractured Atlas” only and are tax-­deductible to the extent permitted by law.</p>

<h3>What's This All About, <i>Really</i>?</h3>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<div><div>
<p><i>H.T. Darling's Incredible Musaeum presents: The Treasures of New Galapagos, Astonishing Acquisitions from the Perisphere</i>, immerses the audience inside a Belle Epoque-style cabinet of curiosities.  Within this magical yet familiar framework, a series of controversial stories unfolds. H. T. Darling is a high society explorer who has just returned from an expedition to an area of outer space, “The Perisphere,” where he has discovered a planet he calls New Galapagos. The Musaeum is presenting a grand exhibition of his findings. By interacting with the curious inhabitants of the museum, the building, and the exhibition itself, each audience member must choose their own path through the evening's strange events.</p>
<p>This installation and performance will ask the audience to consider the stories we tell ourselves about authenticity and truth. Visitors will find themselves confronting the conflicting themes of western museum history: on the one hand an experience of wonder, exploration of new worlds, the beauty of the exotic; on the other hand exploitation, corruption, imperialism, and the questionable role of the patriarchy as historical authority. The current social and political climate requires artwork that prompts deep thinking, dialogue and direct interaction with others - performers and other audience members alike.</p>
<div><p>In the last two years, we created <i>The Mesmeric Revelations! of Edgar Allan Poe</i>, the longest running immersive theater experience in Baltimore history, and the highly acclaimed one-woman show (Siobhan O'Loughlin) <i>Broken Bone Bathtub. </i>In both cases we activated historic spaces, collaborated with a diverse group of artists and performers, and brought in a wide variety of audience members, many of whom had little history of attending theatrical events. We learned so much from these productions. More importantly, these experiences helped us to hone our vision for the devising process and content of <i>Musaeum</i>.</p></div>
<div>Your contribution to <i>Musaeum</i>, in any amount, will help us to create something wonderful and push into exciting new territory.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Given the scope of this project, we know that there are challenges ahead. But, with your assistance, we feel confident - especially with such smart, creative collaborators by our side - that we will be able to bring this show to fruition.</div>

<h2>what the hell is this</h2>
<p><i>tender of you too</i>, by Anya Richkind, follows Allegra and Tara after they’re cast in their high school play as Frances Willard and Mary Bannister—two real-life late-19th Century leaders of the Women’s Christian Temperance Movement. Frances’ diary and her correspondence with Mary, the basis for the school play, describes a genuine, beautiful love between the two women. Through performing this love story, Allegra and Tara slowly realize their feelings for each other, and try, with varying degrees of success, to deal with how messy it has all become.</p>
<p>On Thursday, August 25, 2016, there will be a public staged reading of the play at Theatre 54 at Shetler Studios.</p>
<h2>what the hell is hysteria</h2>
<h3>and who the hell are we</h3>
<p>We're Hysteria.</p>
<p>Hysteria strives to close the gap between the development and production of new work, using collaborative dramaturgical development that leads to a guaranteed full production, demonstrating our commitment to the playwrights whose work we select. We are also committed to collaborating with a diverse group of playwrights, actors, directors, and dramaturgs who are able to bring their varied experiences to the work.</p>
<p>We admit that Hysteria is in its infancy, so full productions aren’t possible quite yet. This staged reading is our first hurdle, and will hopefully bring us into toddlercy. Our name refers to how, historically, any female emotion was medically diagnosed as “hysteria.” We are two angry feminist queer women who, although the company’s mission statement is deliberately broad, are personally committed to reclaiming “hysteria” in every sense of the word and representing it on stage.</p>
<p>Danielle Feder (Hysteria co-founder, Producer/Dramaturg) is a dramaturg, producer, and writer. By day, she works in marketing for an Off-Broadway theatre and is the copy editor for The Interval, a website dedicated to women in theatre. She's also worked for NYMF, the Vineyard Theatre, Atlantic Theater Company, TACT, and the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Dara Epstein (Hysteria co-founder, Director) is an actor, singer, director, and writer. She is a 2014 graduate of Hunter College, where she wrote and produced an original play based on the Greek myth of Persephone directed by Remy Leelike, the lighting designer for<i> tender of you too</i>. Although she has been a proud New Yorker for the last eight years, she is leaving the city in September to pursue an MA in Applied Theatre at Goldsmiths, University of London. </p>
<p>Anya Richkind (Playwright) is a recent graduate of Yale University, and has studied under Donald Margulies, Deb Margolin and Sarah Ruhl. Anya’s latest play, <i>tender of you too</i>, was a finalist in the O’Neill Theater Center’s 2016 National Playwrights Conference. Anya’s first play, <i>The Secret of Asteraceae</i>, commissioned by Marin Country Day School, was produced by the American Conservatory Theater’s Young Conservatory in San Francisco.</p>

<h2>where the hell is my money going</h2>
<h3>Great question!</h3>
<p>First and foremost, we're paying for rehearsal and performance space.</p>

This includes our cast of three, a lighting designer so you're not just staring at white light on a few folding chairs, and a stage manager to help us not lose our minds.

staff members that they may not have in other companies.  We pride
ourselves on collaborating with, teaching, and mentoring  Up and Coming
performers and staff members.  
Operating independently of a park
district or large governing body has allowed Up and Coming the freedom to
choose shows that the community is excited about and fit our company mission.
We like being able to do the shows we WANT to do; unregulated and uncensored.
 However, this means we are funded exclusively by ticket sales and private
donations.  This is where you come in- we need your help!
Please help us
continue to provide educational experiences while creating professional
productions.

Support UAC. 

WHAT WE
NEED:
We are seeking a minimum of $5,000 to help Up and Coming continue to produce high quality theatre experiences.  The funds will be exclusively used on sets, marketing, and costumes.  No donations will be used to pay staff or band members.  
UAC PROUDLY ANNOUNCES OUR SUMMER 2015 SHOW, SEUSSICAL!







Up and Coming Theatre is proud to announce our Summer 2015 musical, Seussical! Come join the Cat in the Hat, Horton, Jojo, Gertrude McFuzz, and many more familiar Seuss faces in a family-friendly extravaganza!
Auditions will take place in May. Performances will be in August 2015. For more information, visit our web site!



OTHER
WAYS YOU CAN HELP:
We know that not all people have the ability to donate monetarily.  However, that does not mean that you cannot help Up and Coming Theatre be successful in our campaign.  Please post the link to this Indigogo campaign on your social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, or send this to your entire email list.  Help us get the word out to as many people as possible!

OUR
COMPANY:
Mission
Statement
Our mission is to provide professional level performances with equal regard to music, voice, dancing, and acting. Our goal is to raise the bar on what community theatre has typically been in terms of output, and yet retain the communal aspects. We give opportunities to aspiring professionals so they can obtain practical experience, grow as people, and expand their artistry.  But most importantly, we are about challenging ourselves as artists through teamwork, cooperation, and constant support and encouragement.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<i>No Provenance </i>is headed to FringeNYC</h3>
<p>It's a brand-new drama by Kate Holland &amp; Caroline Prugh. We have been in rehearsals for over a month, and we open August 10th at the Kraine Theater in New York, as part of the New York Fringe Festival. That's less than four weeks away!</p>
<p>I'd like to tell you about the show, to ask for your help, and to invite you to become a part of this very exciting production.</p>
<h3>The Show<br/>
</h3>
<b>From our postcard</b><i>:</i><p><i>The provisions of a will entice three estranged sisters to their great-grandmother's Paris apartment, untouched since 1945. Guided by Clotho, one of the Greek Fates, they search through the relics, as the past begins to unravel around them</i>.</p>
<i>No Provenance </i>takes place simultaneously in the pre-WWII era and in 2014, weaving together a scattered family's past and present.

But donors to <i>No Provenance</i> can get tickets as part of their perks, in a special deal.<br/><b><br/>How it all happened (mostly):</b><br/>Early last year, Kate Holland had an idea for a story that she wanted to tell on stage. She had characters and a situation in mind, but only a rough idea of plot, and no dialogue. So in July 2013, she got together with playwright Caroline Prugh, seven actresses, choreographer Marine Sialelli, and producer Justin Cornell (that's me) for two weeks of workshops at Columbia University. Every day, Kate would describe a portion of the story, and the actresses would improvise scenes around it. Then at night, Caroline would write dialogue based on these improvisations and flesh out the scenes. At the end of two weeks, to our surprise, we had a full draft of a play. <br/><br/>There have been more readings and a lot more re-writing since then, and some of the participants have changed, but most of what you'll see in this year's FringeNYC Festival was born over a year ago in those workshops.<br/><br/><h3>Who We Are</h3>

At the beginning of the play, Procne is married off to Tereus, the King of Thrace, as a political move for the sisters’ home of Athens. Procne has trouble adjusting in this new land, so she asks Tereus to bring her sister to Thrace. Tereus travels back to Athens to fulfill his wife’s wishes.

</ul><h3>Why are you doing this play?</h3><p>Although there has been progress, gender inequality is still an issue all around the world. This play looks at the violence that erupts out of enforced silence. In order to incite change, women need their voices and opinions to be heard. This play is important to us artistically and morally. Theatre is an incredibly useful platform to spark conversation, which can then lead to change. We are hoping our production will do just that.</p><h3>What’s so hard about it?</h3><p>We have assembled a team of 16 actors and a crew of 11. This is an incredibly ambitious piece for us to tackle, especially as Insomnium’s inaugural play. The audience will only be around 40 people, creating an intimacy that we feel is essential for this play. Due to the small size of the audience and the affordable ticket prices, we will need to fundraise almost the entire budget. We are thrilled by the challenge of taking an epic play and producing it with such a small amount of resources. Actors will not only play roles, but embody scenery and props, using elemental theatricality to create a heightened reality. In the true spirit of Insomnium, we will rely on the imagination of the audience as our actors and creative team use theatre magic to transform our white box space into the world of The Love of the Nightingale. </p><h3>How can we help?</h3><ul>

All funding will go towards rehearsal space rental, theatre rental, props, costumes, and lighting equipment. 
Why are you doing this play?Although there has been progress, gender inequality is still an issue all around the world. This play looks at the violence that erupts out of enforced silence. In order to incite change, women need their voices and opinions to be heard. This play is important to us artistically and morally. Theatre is an incredibly useful platform to spark conversation, which can then lead to change. We are hoping our production will do just that.What’s so hard about it?We have assembled a team of 16 actors and a crew of 11. This is an incredibly ambitious piece for us to tackle, especially as Insomnium’s inaugural play. The audience will only be around 40 people, creating an intimacy that we feel is essential for this play. Due to the small size of the audience and the affordable ticket prices, we will need to fundraise almost the entire budget. We are thrilled by the challenge of taking an epic play and producing it with such a small amount of resources. Actors will not only play roles, but embody scenery and props, using elemental theatricality to create a heightened reality. In the true spirit of Insomnium, we will rely on the imagination of the audience as our actors and creative team use theatre magic to transform our white box space into the world of The Love of the Nightingale. How can we help?

<h3>what's the show?</h3>
<p>​The nation has never been healthier. Crime is down. Streets are clean. Civility reigns. But out of the corner of your eye, you might catch a glimpse of the men keeping things orderly. In a series of brief, enigmatic scenes, two women take us into the heart of a nation that has been disciplined by violence. A daughter leaves her mother to join the revolution.

<h3>what do we want to do?</h3>
<p>We want to bring our production of <i>bad things happen here </i>to the <a href=""https://www.edfringe.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Edinburgh Fringe</a>. Edinburgh Festival Fringe is a major arts festival that takes over the whole city for the month of August. Theatre artists of all stripes, from famous actors to street performers, bring their work to the Fringe. It's a chance to present our production to a whole new audience at one of the most well-respected theatre festivals in the world. It's also a chance to bring producers and artistic staff of theaters from all over the world to the show and present our work for them. </p>
</div><div>
<p>Plus we think British people will like this play.</p>
<h3>what do we need?</h3>
<p>We need $18,000 to go to Edinburgh. We have already secured $10,000 from other grants and funds, which has allowed us to move ahead with this production. We just need to raise the remaining funds from folks like you! Here's how our money will be spent:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$6000 for Travel: </strong>We've gotta get our team of six (two actors, a playwright, a director, a designer and a stage manager) over to Scotland.</li>
<li>
<strong>$6000 for Lodging: </strong>We are renting two AirBnBs to house all six of us while we're there.</li>
<li>
<strong>$3000 for Venue: </strong>This covers all of our expenses for renting the theater we've been programmed at, The Vault at Paradise Green.</li>
<li>
<b>$3000 for Miscellaneous: </b>This includes artist stipends, marketing materials, SIM cards and a contingency for unanticipated expenses.</li>

<h3>the impact</h3>
<p>We believe that this production has something important to bring to the global stage in this moment. The messages coming out of the US these days are full of hate, small-mindedness, jingoism, and chauvinism. <i>bad things happen here</i> is the opposite of these trends: it is complicated, globally-minded in style and content. It places the stories of women, people of color, and queer folk front and center. It warns of the dangers of surveillance and cautions us to be aware of the linguistic changes that come with oppressive regimes. It focuses not on those fighting a violent government, but on those just trying to get through the day, and the compromises and changes that they must make in order to survive. This is a different angle than many stories that are created in troubled political times, and one that we feel is crucial to bring to the debate.</p>
<p>We are a group of theater artists from DC, California, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Iowa, who all met in a small city in the center of the country. We’re very excited to show the world that there is groundbreaking, forward-thinking art being made far from New York, LA, and Chicago; in parts of America that most people abroad never hear about. In doing so, we hope to advocate for the importance of the arts across American communities.</p>

<p>Of course there's always risks to making theatre. Risk is intrinsic to live performance. And, while the risks of theatermaking are not new to us, we've never mounted a production of this scale on our own, and we've never produced outside the US before.</p>

<p><b>THE SHOW</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Beauty’s Legacy</i> is a sci-fi comedy/drama about revered geneticist Victor, who, using his
maladjusted lab assistant as a guinea pig, creates the most beautiful, stylish
and vain monster the world has ever seen.  This sets off a whirlwind of

THE SHOW

Beauty’s Legacy is a sci-fi comedy/drama about revered geneticist Victor, who, using his
maladjusted lab assistant as a guinea pig, creates the most beautiful, stylish
and vain monster the world has ever seen.  This sets off a whirlwind of
events that threaten to tear apart his career, his marriage and all known society.
Utilizing a strong visual style and an electronic soundtrack Beauty’s
Legacy rips through media culture, tears open financially obsessed
societies and examines the value of the legacy we leave behind.
We will be touring East Anglia and performing at Brighton Fringe.

MONEY

We are looking to work from an equity fringe agreement.  This means
the four practitioners on tour with the show get paid at least minimum
wage.  It sounds obvious but most fringe shows struggle to achieve
this.  
We're very lucky to have attracted an amazing cast who really believe in

<h3>Sound Moves by Chrissy Martin</h3>
<p>I am a dancer, singer, and movement educator whose creative home for the last five years has been in Chicago, IL. Sound Moves will be my last performance in this fair city before moving to Northampton, MA to pursue an MFA in choreography and performance at Smith College. I want to give back to this community by featuring the amazing performers in this piece, performing at my favorite venue, Links Hall, and by sharing my creative process with the audience, allowing them to be a part of my work.</p> <p>Dance as an art form is historically poorly funded, and much of what it takes to produce a work is expected to be donated in-kind by performers and choreographers. The level of expertise we have in our field can be valued at $50/hour or more, but more often than not we are left to produce work by paying for it rather than getting paid or breaking even. In an effort to offset the endemic underpayment of our art form, I am drawing on the support of my community (that's you!) to help me make this model of respecting performers for their time possible.</p> <p>It seems small, but this type of a crowdfunding campaign does so much good. It allows my performers to feel valued and appreciated, it keeps my rent paid, it gives me and other young, independent artists hope that creating art is worth doing; that we can put ourselves out there and get back what we give.</p> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This money will help me do a few things:</p>
<p>1. The majority of this fundraising money will pay my artists. Performing artists regularly do unpaid labor, even in larger, more financially stable companies. I want to change this model one show at a time. Pay me so I can pay them!</p>
<p>2. I will pay myself back for rehearsal space, my biggest expense for this project.</p>
<p>3. I will be able to pay a professional videographer to record this show so it can live on my website and for future promotional material.</p>
<p>4. I will give myself a small budget for costumes and programs.</p> <p>You get a chance to support some artists that you know and care about, as well as some fun perks for your donations, including social media shoutouts, an original ""Sound Moves"" zine, and private voice/movement sessions from yours truly.</p> <p>What else do you get?

<p>KISS ME CAKE is a full sensory exploration of the female psyche told through dance and cake, to be performed at Cafe Nordo August 9 - 13, 2018. From a young girl’s dream of being a ballerina to her sensual awakening and beyond, each dance is paired with Dillard’s own confections and scored with live music. Cake recipes become arias, and the voice of Julia Child provides the backdrop for an unforgettable union of bodies and buttercream. The evening includes light, savory fare in the style of a French royal banquet before launching into the main event, cake after cake after cake.<br/> </p>
<h3>Help us pay the artists</h3>
<p>This campaign will help to build the lavish cake sets and costumes of our dreams, and towards compensating the performing and creative artists, who each are receiving small stipends, but whose worth and value equal a great deal more - and we want to pay them accordingly.</p>
<p>$1,500 to pay for set materials and costumes</p>
<p>$1,800 to pay each the 12 creative and performing artists $150</p>
<p>Our stretch goal of $5,000 will enable us pay the artists more fully for their time and expertise. Even if we don't reach the entire goal, donations will cover those costs as far as they go--every little bit helps!</p>
<p>To thank you for your contribution, we are offering exclusive perks including: cast resin flowers from the set, a pair of signed toe shoes, a custom cake, seats at the private preview, a chance to attend the micro-kitchen preview, a private buttercream party, and business sponsorships. All donations will be tax deductible through the non-profit umbrella of Cafe Nordo.<br/> </p>
<h3>Behind the cake</h3>
<p>Kristina Dillard comes from a culture of cake.  As a little girl, she sat at the kitchen counter and watched as her grandmother made birthday and wedding cakes for people in her community. The craft was passed down to her mother who made hundreds of wedding cakes as Kristina grew up in their family restaurant.  Now, Dillard makes her own custom art cakes, gluten free and allergen friendly, styling herself herself as <i>Kiss Me Cake Kristina</i>.</p>
<p>Kristina has been performing, creating, and producing work in Seattle since 1993. She is the artistic director of the Big Red Dance Company, receiving grants from the Seattle Arts Commission, the Washington State Arts Commission, and the Allied Arts Foundation. Her choreography for Big Red Dance has been presented by Velocity, On the Boards, Seattle Center, and 10 Tiny Dances in Seattle and Portland. <br/> </p>

pause in Australia to be a part of the Adelaide Fringe, where we will 
perform at The Wheatsheaf Hotel, as well as at Barossa Valley Brewing, 
in the heart of wine country.  When we reach the US, we will begin our

<div><strong><br/><br/>WHO WE ARE</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>   We are a group of young, enthusiastic artists attempting to take our craft to the next level by breaking the mold of conventional theater and giving Waterville strength to unify. In Maine, we will explore themes of adventure, of hardship, of the strong Maine spirit that laughs in the face of chiseling a vehicle out of a block of ice every morning.</div>
<div>   Creating the performance will involve a rigorous training regimen and multi-faceted creative process. We plan to use physical theater in conjunction with SITI Company’s Viewpoints vocabulary to create an engaging piece of theater and cultivate an empowered audience.</div>
<div>   Our aesthetic is rural and worn. Carhart pants and flannel shirts, weathered posts leaning into the wind. Cracked and curled birch bark next to a shed snake skin. Rolling fields of wheat and blooms of broccoli, loose soil falling through soft hands. Hard work that leaves muscles sore and eyes bleary, coming home to rest in a scratchy horsehair armchair.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>   An important aspect of our undertaking is the belief that artists do not have to starve for their work. Creating art can and should be a full time job that pays its players more than nothing. Part of this project is to pay the artists a small stipend for their stay in Maine. We will also provide food and housing so that their main concern is the work at hand.</div>
<div>   <strong>In order for the Strike Team to live, eat, and travel within Waterville for our stay, we need to raise $8,000.00 (That is not including the funds we need for  costumes, set design, production, etc.) By donating $10, you will be feeding one artist for one day. By donating $70, you will be feeding an artist for a week. It may not seem like a lot, but it is absolutely essential to the success of this project.</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>   By donating to Horsehair Strike Team, you will be promoting young artists who need (especially at this stage) support in order to create the work they dream about. You will also directly contribute to the strengthening of communities. Our goal isn’t just to make art but to make art that empowers, and celebrates the bond that is a group of people working together to make life a little better - for everyone. And we haven't even begun to mention the perks that come with your donation. Check them out!</div>
<div>   The success or failure of the project will determines it's future and whether other communities around the nation will benefit from what we are so eager to offer; Our time, our energy, our art, and the belief that when people work together - anything is possible.</div>

<p>To any would-be donors out there who may be thinking: ""Oh well, they've done it; why would they need my help?"", please know that any contributions in excess of our goal will only enhance our production.

Also, we've got a fridge full of brownies, folks, and we want YOU to have them! We made a bunch of brownies to encourage further donations when we were still $200 from our goal, see, and then we hit our goal, and now the brownies are sitting in the fridge when they should be in your mouth!

<p>There are still 5 days left to conribute to the Canadian premiere of <em>Tender Napalm</em> at SummerWorks; please support this exciting project!</p>

<p><strong>Who We Are &amp; What We're Doing </strong></p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Our names are Kyle Purcell and Amelia Sargisson, and we're Toronto-based theatre-makers.  We first read Philip Ridley's play, <em>Tender Napalm</em>, in our backyard last summer, and instantly knew we wanted to share this staggeringly beautiful piece with Canadian audiences.  We applied to the prestigious SummerWorks Festival, Canada's largest juried theatre festival, which is now entering its 23rd year, and found out in April that we were accepted!  Wahoo!  Since then, we've worked tirelessly to assemble an amazing team of artists to help us realize our dream, and we've also invested our own money to cover performance rights and the SummerWorks participation fee.  We've started this IndieGogo campaign to help us raise the rest of the funds we need to produce the Canadian premiere of <em>Tender Napalm</em>, the internationally acclaimed smash-hit by Philip Ridley.</p>
<p>In this 'unmissable' play, Man and Woman weave fantastical yarns in order to overcome their pain and carve out a brave new world in which they can love again.  The latter-day Adam and Eve navigate a phantasmagoric deluge of sea monsters, monkey soldiers, and flying saucers, while revealing glimpses of their fragile, real life selves.  This explosive two-hander, with its violent lyricism and pulsating sexuality, has seared itself into the minds of audiences the world over.  It's at once uniquely imaginative and universally transcendent, speaking to such themes as how love survives tragedy and how the stories we tell make up our realities. </p>
<p><em>Tender Napalm</em> premiered in 2011 in London, England, at Southwark Playhouse.  It was nominated for a <em>London Award for Art and Performance</em> in the category of Best Play.  It subsequently embarked on a smash-hit UK tour and has since been produced to great critical and popular acclaim around the world, from Ireland to Australia to Off-Broadway.  It has been described as 'a visionary work' by one of England's most celebrated living playwrights, himself heralded by <em>Time Out</em> magazine as 'probably a genius.'</p>
<p>Producing <em>Tender Napalm</em> within the context of a festival such as SummerWorks gives us access to an amazing venue, the storied Theatre Passe Muraille BackSpace, and allows us to reach a wide and diverse audience that would be inaccessible to us if we were producing this play independently.  We have also assembled an amazing team of theatre professionals who are very generously donating their time to this project.  As soon as we read the script, we knew we wanted to mine it with director Cynthia Ashperger; Cynthia is the head of acting at the Ryerson Theatre School and a former teacher of both of ours.  She is an accomplished performer, writer, and director, and her passion, fire, and expertise made her an obvious choice for this densely lyrical play.  We have also rallied assistant director Brittney Francis and a wildly talented design team consisting of Simon Rossiter (Lighting), David Mesiha (Music Compostion/Sound), Mariuxi Zambrano (Set/Costume), and Chloe Purcell (Graphic Design).  Rounding out the collective is stage manager Sonia Vaillant.  We are so humbled to be working with such incredibly gifted people, and are so excited to have them all on board.  </p>
<p>Now that we are about to embark on rehearsals, we need your help.  </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Any donation you make, no matter how big or small, will help us achieve our dream of putting on this play.  Some of our costs include: set pieces, props, costumes, rehearsal space, publicity (like printing posters and postcards), advertising, our web presence, fundraising fees, photocopying, and the list goes on.  It is also important to note that Phantasmagoria Collective is operating under a profit-share model.  Any profit that the production makes, whether through fund-raising or ticket sales, will be divided evenly among the Collective members as an honorarium for the time and talent they have donated to this project.  </p>
<p>We will, of course, be judicious in our budgeting and inventive in our problem-solving, stretching every cent you donate.  Rest assured that any money you donate will go directly to funding the success of this production.</p>
<p>BUT, we don't want you to donate your hard-earned money just for the warm, fuzzy feeling you'll get from supporting the arts; we also have a ton of great perks to thank you for your generosity.  We're so grateful that you would donate to our project and help this production come to life that we're going to thank you with personal and meaningful rewards at every donation level. For out of town or overseas donors who won't be in Toronto anytime soon and can't redeem their perk, we can substitute perks from other donation levels; please get in touch and we'll hook you up! Please check out the side bar for more details; we're confident you'll find something there you'll love.  </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for checking out our Indiegogo page and thinking of making a donation to fund the Canadian premiere of <em>Tender Naplam.</em>  If you can't make a donation now but are excited about our project, there are still lots of ways you can help us out.  Please share our Indiegogo campaign with your friends and family, spread the word through Facebook, twitter, tumbler, pinterest, email, even take a photo and post it on instagram; anything you can do to get the word out is greatly appreciated!  </p>
<p>And of course, if you are in Toronto from August 8-18th, please come see us perform the Canadian premiere of Philip Ridley's <em>Tender Napalm</em> at the Theatre Passe Muraille Backspace.</p>

<h3>The Story<br/>
</h3>
<p>By now we have all seen the macabre photos taken by G.H. Farnum of the Nelson's hanging from a bridge across the North Canadian River. I have written to keep the legacy of the Nelsons alive. I do not want them remembered simply hanging dead from a piece of rope. They were individuals who existed on this earth and tried to make it just like everyone else when harm befell them--when life happened. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So many of us have questions about who they were, where they were from, and how things got to the point that they were imprisoned and then consequently murdered. The play--this campaign--called Laura, on High serves to bring these three individuals to life--to resurrect them so we do not forget these tragic events of American history that occurred because people were full of hate and spite; so that we might learn from ourselves.<br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contributing to this project gives voice to the hard truths of our 
past and can liberate a generation of youths 
who have grown up uneducated, protected from reality, and 
otherwise secluded from our sometimes gruesome past. With the telling of Laura, on High we risk sticking 
up for ourselves again, we risk taking everyone's position into account,
 we risk living for humanity again.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Laura, on High, a riveting new drama by Andrew Hardaway, is the fictional account of the events leading up to the real-life 1911 lynching of Laura and LD Nelson. Laura falls prey to Oeishi, a local white Peace Officer, after the recent death of her baby girl and the loss of her bread-winning job that has helped sustain the family since their removal from Texas. With the intermittent presence of her husband, Austin, Laura finds herself in a void of hurt and loneliness in a society of repression and racial controls. So, that when lines are crossed, guns are fired, bonds are tightened, necks are stretched beneath the North Canadian River Bridge. <span style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"">The play will begin the grueling rehearsal and technical processes in August 2011 and premiere the week of the lynching's 101st Anniversary (May 25) in San Antonio (The Carver Center for Performing Arts) and Austin, Texas (venue TBA).</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Laura, on High endeavors to touch on three black lives lost to injustice and circumstance. It fuels a deeper appreciation for the ghastly photos of the real-life Laura and LD Nelson as it provides a story and circumstance that begs to touch the tenderness and pathos of human existence.</p>

send Monkeywood to !Monkeywood
Theatre are a Manchester-based Theatre Company who have been producing
successful, engaging and ambitious high-quality theatre since 2003. Our current
production is Once in a House on Fire by Sarah McDonald Hughes, a  play based on the characters,
themes and places in the bestselling memoir of the same name by Andrea
Ashworth. Following sell out performances at The Lowry, Salford Quays, with 5
star reviews, we will be performing at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, at The
Zoo Venue’s Monkey House, from Friday 5 - Monday 29 August 2011.“I read this book over 5 years ago and it still
lingers. If any story should have life beyond the page, this is it. A raw,
sometimes bleak but uplifting and inspiring true story….” Maxine
Peake (Silk, BBC 1)

Who are Monkeywood?
Monkeywood are Martin Gibbons, Sarah
McDonald Hughes and Francesca Waite. Our previous work includes the 2010 Arts
Council funded tour of Maine Road which was highly acclaimed (including
unanimous 4* reviews and sell out audiences) for its authentic voice, excellent
writing and superb performances; Last Orders, which was commissioned by
the Royal Exchange for their sell-out PUB season in December 2009 and
subsequently selected for The Library Theatre’s Re:Play season (staged at The
Contact in January 2011); and A Song for the Lovers, which was produced
at The Lowry in 2008 gaining 5* reviews and named as one of What’s On Stage’s
top productions of 2008.


Why Once in a House on Fire?“A new start tomorrow, a whole new
life it’ll be.”


In a
rainy world of poverty, violence, packing up and moving on, Andy and her
sisters escape through stories, games and dreams of a ‘happy family’. But with
each new start ending faster than the last, their hopes are stubbed out with
their mum’s cigarettes. As a life beyond ’s grey sky beckons,
Andy knows her escape will come at a cost. Following a sell-out run at The Lowry,
Once in a House on Fire, based on the best-selling memoirs of Andrea Ashworth,
is an extraordinary story about ordinary people.


One of our key aims
as a company is to make theatre with a northern voice, rooted in the community
where we live and work. We were in the midst of rehearsals for another project,
, when mention of the book Once in a House on Fire
kept cropping up. We were struck by how vivid, heartbreakingly truthful and
deeply affecting this Manchester-based story is and how close it is to many
people’s hearts, so we became excited at its theatrical potential.


“I’m thrilled that Once in a House on
Fire is being brought to life on the stage through the fabulous Monkeywood
Theatre, and immensely proud that they’re devoting their unique talents and
passion to sharing this story.  I can’t wait to see what they do…” Andrea Ashworth
Andrea grew up in Moss Side, where Martin
and Sarah now live, and went to the same sixth form college as Sarah and
Francesca. Her story immediately felt like one which had real meaning for us
and, more importantly, for our community and audience. Hers is a recognisable
family – a unit of strong women who support each other in the face of poverty,
discrimination, violence and constant disruption. What really stands out in the
writing is the sheer strength of these women, their loyalty and love for each
other, their bravery and their ability to carry on against the odds.“Once in a House on Fire is a realistic
picture of a dysfunctional family, but not a bleak one. The affection
between the sisters, which is a key factor in their survival, is reflected
in the vivid performances.…It is a tribute to the skill of the company that we
care as much for those left behind as we do about the central character.” Public Reviews
****The
preliminary research for the script and spring 2011 tour of Once in a House
on Fire was developed with support from The Lowry Studio and Arts Council
England and funded through grants for the arts. The ImpactWe believe in the power of theatre as a valuable tool to help explore and
understand the world we live in and we feel that theatre at its best can
transform lives. We strongly believe that this very important story, and
the piece of theatre we have created, will resonate with audiences across the
country and have a real impact on those who come to see it.Having already established a core audience in the north of , we are really keen to develop an
audience nationally and the Edinburgh Festival will be the first time that our
work has been seen outside of the north. As a company we aim to engage with a
non-traditional theatre-going audience and feel that performing Once in a
House on Fire at the Edinburgh Festival will enable this. This true story
is universal and compelling, offering an accessible way for non-theatregoers to
see inspiring and thought-provoking drama that resonates with them.“If the theatre company are looking to draw people from a
working class background, who wouldn't normally attend such shows, then from my
experience yesterday, you are doing a superb job.” Once in a House on Fire audience member

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Theatre Daedalus is headed to The Edinburgh Fringe Festival to present the World Premiere of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Unanswered, We Ride</span>, an original play by Jaclyn Villano.  After workshops at The Last Frontier Theatre Conference in Valdez, Alaska, and the National Comedy Theater in New York, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Unanswered, We Ride</span> will take flight at the Edinburgh Fringe, the largest theater festival in the world.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We need your help getting <a href=""http://www.theatredaedalus.com/unansweredweride/game"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">across the pond</a>!  As you may imagine, taking a show to an international festival is tremendously expensive. Many people have been generous already, but we still have a lot of money to raise.  With your generosity, Theatre Daedalus will proudly debut <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Unanswered, We Ride</span> at this major theatrical event.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>About <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Unanswered, We Ride</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>When her nine-year old daughter takes a fall from the monkey bars at school, Reese O'Leary's well-crafted life changes forever. Her paradigm shattered, Reese does what any devoted wife and mother would do — runs away from home. <i>Unanswered, We Ride</i> takes us on a journey from a quiet Ohio town to the lush hills of Ireland, from the sleepless streets of Manhattan to the teacup ride at Disney World. Against a backdrop of loss and longing, playwright Jaclyn Villano challenges us to explore the people and places that make up who we are, and define for ourselves what home really means. Directed by <strong>Elena Araoz</strong>†, the production features <strong>Joy Barrett</strong>*, <strong>Joe Tippett</strong>*, and <strong>Martha Wollner</strong>*.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is a play about life and how even at our darkest points we have the capacity to move forward.  Some who have donated to this production have done so in memory of loved ones; if you would like to dedicate your contribution, please let us know and we will be sure to include your loved one's name in our program.  <br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Theatre Daedalus is headed to The Edinburgh Fringe Festival to present the World Premiere of Unanswered, We Ride, an original play by Jaclyn Villano.  After workshops at The Last Frontier Theatre Conference in Valdez, Alaska, and the National Comedy Theater in New York, Unanswered, We Ride will take flight at the Edinburgh Fringe, the largest theater festival in the world.

We need your help getting across the pond!  As you may imagine, taking a show to an international festival is tremendously expensive. Many people have been generous already, but we still have a lot of money to raise.  With your generosity, Theatre Daedalus will proudly debut Unanswered, We Ride at this major theatrical event.

About Unanswered, We Ride

When her nine-year old daughter takes a fall from the monkey bars at school, Reese O'Leary's well-crafted life changes forever. Her paradigm shattered, Reese does what any devoted wife and mother would do — runs away from home. Unanswered, We Ride takes us on a journey from a quiet Ohio town to the lush hills of Ireland, from the sleepless streets of Manhattan to the teacup ride at Disney World. Against a backdrop of loss and longing, playwright Jaclyn Villano challenges us to explore the people and places that make up who we are, and define for ourselves what home really means. Directed by Elena Araoz†, the production features Joy Barrett*, Joe Tippett*, and Martha Wollner*.

This is a play about life and how even at our darkest points we have the capacity to move forward.  Some who have donated to this production have done so in memory of loved ones; if you would like to dedicate your contribution, please let us know and we will be sure to include your loved one's name in our program.

The Impact
The Edinburgh Fringe is the largest arts festival on earth: in 2010, more than 21,000 performers brought more than 2,400 shows to life at the Fringe. This is an unparalleled opportunity for artists to come together to perform and network with producers, promoters, journalists, directors and media professionals. Many productions have been successfully developed here, and many performers have had their careers transformed by a successful run at the Fringe.Our goal is to gain international recognition and exposure for Unanswered, We Ride, and to catapult this exposure into production runs both in the United States and abroad.  



Where The Money Goes 

 How does each donation help? Funds raised for Unanswered, We Ride will go toward:•Room and board for cast and crew for 4 weeks•Actor/director salaries•Cost of designers•Airfare for the cast and crew•Insurance•Venue rental fee•Hiring a publicity team•Press and marketing materials, online and in print•Production costs (lighting, set design, set construction, costumes, etc.)•Rehearsal time/space•Operational costs (printing/faxing/etc.)

Theatre Daedalus is a 501(c)3 organization, and all donations to this project are tax-deductible.

Hello. We are The Real MacGuffins – a London based sketch comedy group.
We have had two multi-5-star, sell-out runs at the Edinburgh Comedy Festival, as well as gigging across the country, supporting comedians including Stewart Lee, Dave Gorman and Perrier Award Winners Tim Vine, Phil Nichol, Adam Riches (2011) and Doctor Brown (2012).

<h3>The PITCH</h3>
<p>My name is Samantha Ciavarella and I have recently stumbled into the world of playwrighting and producing my own shows.  I am one of five other shows chosen for the full length portion of the Strawberry Theater Festival this upcoming August.  I have competed in the Strawberry Festival before and I understand the high cost of producing a show, and that's where YOU come in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Break Room is a simple story that packs a crazy punch.  A nice guy is pushed to his breaking point after teasing and bullying from his co-workers becomes too much, and he's driven to do the unexpected.  The underlying theme here is bullying and the impact words have on people, even when you think you're just ""fooling around"".  As kids we're taught that ""sticks and stones can break your bones but names will never hurt me.""  Well, as adults, sometimes the names can hurt you and sometimes you do things you never thought you were capable of.  It is my goal to explore those breaking points with my actors and deliver a play to audiences that teaches people to watch what they say because their words can have dire consequences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I really love this festival and I'm very excited about it!  My cast is amazing too!  Featuring the unbelievable talent of Daniel Harward, Andrew Mauney, Iliana Inocencio, and Abigail Raye, and directed by myself and Chris Bennett, this is going to be a good time.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $1,000 dollars for a couple of reasons:</p>
<p>1.  The fee to get into the festival was... substantial. </p>
<p>2.  I need to buy some costumes and props for the production.</p>
<p>3.  Every actors dream is to get paid for the hard work they do... It's my dream as a producer to provide a small stipend for my talented cast.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By funding the production of Break Room you are helping get a very serious message across to audiences.  Bullying will never stop, but perhaps through theater, film, and other creative venues, we can get the word out to people that words hurt... and sometimes have terrible consequences.</p>
<p>During March of this year I participated for the first time in the STF with my first play ""Writers Retreat"".  I wass met with a few unexpected successes.  I was nominated for Best Play, Best Actress, and Best Actor (Andrew Schoomaker winning in that category!)  Also, Writers Retreat is currently being published by the Riant Theater.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't fund this project, that's cool!  I get it!  Life costs money to live and sometimes you would rather eat or pay your rent instead of fund a project on indie-go-go.  HOWEVER, you can still come SEE the play happening this August at The Hudson Guild Theater in Manhattan.  Here's the link to buy tickets!</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>

<p><strong>directed by CRAIG BALDWIN  </strong></p>

<p><strong>featuring AYSAN CELIK, MICHAEL RUDKO and NICK WESTRATE</strong></p>
<p><em>A young psychiatric nurse and a famous stage actress share a season, a house, and a psyche.</em></p>
<p>It is a project dear to our hearts, and one we have been working on for two years now.  It started in our living rooms, expanded to a workshop presentation and now we have been chosen to present five performances as part of HERE Arts Center's ""Summer Sublet Series"".  This provides our first opportunity to showcase the production with fully realized performances in a New York venue.  But in order to perform we need to raise $2500 in production costs.</p>
<p>That $2500 will go toward our set, costumes, lighting, sound and video equipment and rehearsal space.</p>
<p>This show is a wild and woolly, psychedelic ride through the remote depths of the human psyche.  It is a real risk for us artistically.  We are all working hard for no money in ways we've never worked before - and we believe as theater artists that those risks are worth taking.  The results are going to be explosive and one-of-a-kind.  Please help us realise this important work.</p>
<p>$10 or $20 will make a huge difference.  Please also consider a $50 or greater contribution, which will include tickets to the show (normally $15 each) and other exciting perks!</p>
<p><strong>The performances are:</strong></p>

<p>The <i>Donaires Ensemble </i>did not obtain the
subventions that it was counting on for this première, and can’t provide its
part of the coproduction due to lack of funds. This is why we are calling on
your generosity and launching this appeal to crowd funding.</p>

<p>Let us imagine a dance company of today, accompanied
by five timeless troubadours, visiting the dance halls and royal courts of 16th
and 17th century Europe. The choreographies of the most illustrious Ballet
Masters will, for a passing moment, animate our dancers. At ease in their
century, they dance choreographies, and play their repertory of dance music
while retaining their own fantasies. Thus they visit, each in its turn,
Domenico da Piacenza near the Palazzo Schifanoia (literally, Palace « Disdains
Boredom ») of Ferrare, les proteges of Margueritte of Bourgogne’s Court, the
festivities of Poitiers and Langres frequented by Thoinot Arbeau, the first
court ballets accompanied par Cesare Negri (violinist of King of France Henry
III). They understand that the dance steps used in Sevilla and taught by Jaque
and Juan de Esquivel in the Iberian peninsula have something to do with those
described by Fabritio Caroso or by a French choreographer officiating at
Darmstadt in Germany at the beginning of the XVII century or still others
admitted into the famous “Gallery of Mirrors” of the Versailles Castle.</p>
<p>Thus,
this voyage opens the perspective on the evident and rich musical,
choreographic and poetic <b><i>Concordances</i></b>. Musicians and dancers converse
and thrive in the veritable, interdisciplinary C<b><i>oncordances</i></b> at the heart
of these <i>movimenti</i>, <i>ruades</i>, <i>floretas</i>, as well as other improvisations…</p>

<p>Imaginons une
compagnie de danse d’aujourd’hui accompagnée de cinq ménétriers intemporels
visitant les dansoirs des cours européennes du XVe au XVIIe siècle. Les
chorégraphies des plus illustres Maîtres de ballet vont alors, le temps d’un
passage, animer nos danseurs. Bien dans leur siècle, ils dansent ces
chorégraphies et jouent ces danseries de répertoire en gardant leurs propres
fantaisies. Ainsi, ils croisent tour à tour Domenico da Piacenza près du
Palazzo Schifanoia (littéralement « Palais dédaigne l’ennui »)
de Ferrare, les protégés de la Cour de Margueritte de Bourgogne, les fêtes de
Poitiers et Langres fréquentées par Thoinot Arbeau, les premiers ballets de
cours accompagnés par Cesare Negri (violoniste du Roi de France Henry III). Ils
comprennent que les pas de danse pratiqués à Séville et enseignés par Jaque et Juan de Esquivel dans la
péninsule ibérique ont quelque chose à voir avec ceux décrits par Fabritio
Caroso ou par un chorégraphe français officiant à Darmstadt en Allemagne au
début du XVIIe siècle ou encore ceux admis dans la célèbre « Galerie des
glaces » du Château de Versailles.</p>

<p>Imaginemos que una compañía de danza actual, acompañada por cinco
ministriles intemporales, esté visitando los
antiguos salones de danza de las cortes europeas desde el siglo XV hasta el
siglo XVII. En cada etapa, las coreografías de los más ilustres Maestros de
ballet animan entonces a nuestros bailarines. Adaptados
al siglo que atraviesan, van bailando estas coreografías y tocando esas dancerías de repertorio a la par que
conservan sus propias fantasías. Así se encuentran sucesivamente con Domenico
da Piacenza cerca del Palazzo Schifanoia (literalmente
Palacio « Desprecia-el fastidio ») de Ferrara, los favoritos de
la Corte de Margarita de Borgoña, las fiestas de Poitiers y Langres
frecuentadas por Thoinot Arbeau, los primeros ballets de corte acompañados por
Cesare Negri (violinista del Rey de Francia Henry III). Entienden que los pasos de danzas practicados en Sevilla y enseñados por
Jaque y Juan de Esquivel en la península ibérica tienen algo que ver con  los que describen Fabritio Caroso o  un coreógrafo francés ejerciendo su oficio en
Darmstadt (Alemania) a principio del siglo XVIIe,  o también con los que se admiten en el famoso Salón de los espejos del
Palacio de Versalles.</p>
<p>Este viaje
abre entonces una perspectiva sobre las evidentes y ricas <b><i>Concordancias </i></b>musicales,
coreográficas o poéticas. Músicos y bailarines dialogan y desarrollan su arte
en verdaderas <b><i>Concordancias</i></b> interdisciplinarias en medio de estos <i>movimenti</i>, <i>ruades</i>, <i>floretas</i> y otras
improvisaciones…</p>

Crowdfunding campaign
This early dance
collaborative needs your help getting their new show Concordances on stage
The Donaires
Ensemble, and its choreographer ANA YEPES, are launching a “crowdfunding” campaign in order to raise the funds
necessary to secure the budget of their next creation, CONCORDANCES, a European ballet for 9 dancers and 5 musicians.
Coproduction of 3 companies :


The
Donaires Ensemble, directed by ANA
YEPES, Evreux, Haute Normandie, France.
    Ensemble Donaïres                      Ana Yepes


The Compagnie Outre Mesure, directed
by ROBIN JOLY, Vendée, France.
Compagnie Outre Mesure


RenaiDanse, directed
by VÉRONIQUE DANIELS, Bâle, Switzerland.
RenaiDanse                                        Véronique Daniels 
The Donaires Ensemble did not obtain the
subventions that it was counting on for this première, and can’t provide its
part of the coproduction due to lack of funds. This is why we are calling on
your generosity and launching this appeal to crowd funding.

       Argument
Let us imagine a dance company of today, accompanied
by five timeless troubadours, visiting the dance halls and royal courts of 16th
and 17th century Europe. The choreographies of the most illustrious Ballet
Masters will, for a passing moment, animate our dancers. At ease in their
century, they dance choreographies, and play their repertory of dance music
while retaining their own fantasies. Thus they visit, each in its turn,
Domenico da Piacenza near the Palazzo Schifanoia (literally, Palace « Disdains
Boredom ») of Ferrare, les proteges of Margueritte of Bourgogne’s Court, the
festivities of Poitiers and Langres frequented by Thoinot Arbeau, the first
court ballets accompanied par Cesare Negri (violinist of King of France Henry
III). They understand that the dance steps used in Sevilla and taught by Jaque
and Juan de Esquivel in the Iberian peninsula have something to do with those
described by Fabritio Caroso or by a French choreographer officiating at
Darmstadt in Germany at the beginning of the XVII century or still others
admitted into the famous “Gallery of Mirrors” of the Versailles Castle.
Thus,
this voyage opens the perspective on the evident and rich musical,
choreographic and poetic Concordances. Musicians and dancers converse
and thrive in the veritable, interdisciplinary Concordances at the heart
of these movimenti, ruades, floretas, as well as other improvisations…

tant pour 2014 que pour 2015.
-  Financer une
part de la recherche en danse, réalisée actuellement par Ana Yepes et sa

Ballet Europeo Concordances Proyecto de FINANCIACIÓN PARTICIPATIVAEste colectivo de música y danza antigua necesita de tu ayuda para llevar al escenario su nueva pieza Concordances


El Ensemble Donaïres y
su coreógrafa ANA YEPES, lanzan un “Crowfunding” o Financiación Participativa
con el fin de reunir los fondos necesarios para cerrar el
presupuesto del próximo estreno, CONCORDANCES
[Concordancias], ballet europeo para
9 bailarines y 5 músicos.
Coproducción de 3 compañías : 
- 
El Ensemble
Donaïres, dirigido por ANA YEPES, Evreux, Haute Normandie, Francia.Ensemble Donaïres            Ana Yepes
- 
La Compagnie
Outre Mesure, dirigido por ROBIN JOLY, Vendée, Francia.Compagnie Outre Mesure      
- 
RenaiDanse, dirigido
por VÉRONIQUE DANIELS, Basilea, Suiza.RenaiDanse                                 Véronique Daniels
 El Ensemble Donaïres no ha recibido las subvenciones que esperaba obtener para la realización de este
espectáculo y no puede aportar su parte de coproducción. Por ello lanzamos
esta financiación participativa.
Para mayor información sobre CONCORDANCES, sobre el programa, las tres compañías y los coreógrafosConcordancesPdf del dossier de Concordances en castellanoArgumento
Imaginemos que una compañía de danza actual, acompañada por cinco
ministriles intemporales, esté visitando los
antiguos salones de danza de las cortes europeas desde el siglo XV hasta el
siglo XVII. En cada etapa, las coreografías de los más ilustres Maestros de
ballet animan entonces a nuestros bailarines. Adaptados
al siglo que atraviesan, van bailando estas coreografías y tocando esas dancerías de repertorio a la par que
conservan sus propias fantasías. Así se encuentran sucesivamente con Domenico
da Piacenza cerca del Palazzo Schifanoia (literalmente
Palacio « Desprecia-el fastidio ») de Ferrara, los favoritos de
la Corte de Margarita de Borgoña, las fiestas de Poitiers y Langres
frecuentadas por Thoinot Arbeau, los primeros ballets de corte acompañados por
Cesare Negri (violinista del Rey de Francia Henry III). Entienden que los pasos de danzas practicados en Sevilla y enseñados por
Jaque y Juan de Esquivel en la península ibérica tienen algo que ver con  los que describen Fabritio Caroso o  un coreógrafo francés ejerciendo su oficio en
Darmstadt (Alemania) a principio del siglo XVIIe,  o también con los que se admiten en el famoso Salón de los espejos del
Palacio de Versalles.
Este viaje
abre entonces una perspectiva sobre las evidentes y ricas Concordancias musicales,
coreográficas o poéticas. Músicos y bailarines dialogan y desarrollan su arte
en verdaderas Concordancias interdisciplinarias en medio de estos movimenti, ruades, floretas y otras
improvisaciones…

we just want to provide an alternativefor those without $80 for a ticketfor those without the means to live in NYCfor those who have to work during box office hoursfor those who can't make it up the stairs to the mezzaninefor those who don't feel safe going out at night.for those who are marginalized, because theater canand should exist in the margins. for all of us.




WHAT IS DIGITAL THEATER?


Digital Theater is theater that is integrated into the digital space, removing the boundaries of price and location and making theater available to as wide and diverse and audience as possible.
All of our shows will be professionally video recorded and released online for pay-what-you-want streaming, and for inexpensive high-quality digital download.
We're working with our resident graphic designer to create animated gifs, which will not only be used as marketing materials, but will be compiled as a set of reaction gifs at the end of the season.
We hope to ultimately create a new model of making work, whereby we can support our company through online sales and small donations, and make our plays cheaply and widely available for years to come.

ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE:


• Allison Ciuci, resident producer (Di and Viv and Rose, Theater Row)


• Jessy Yates, performer-in-residence (BAM's Cripfest)


• Hannah Cook, resident designer (The Neo-Political Cowgirls' EVE, the Gym at Judson)


• Dani Leggard, resident graphic designer


• Ian Elliott, resident videographer (NJTV)


WHAT WE NEED
The initial $10,000 in seed money we're asking for will get us through our first two productions (Thud! and You're Going to Hell if you Laugh), allowing us to pay for props, costumes, space, and most importantly, collaborators! The budget roughly breaks down like this:


$2150 will pay for our Resident Artist stipends, compensating our Artistic Directors, Producer, Videographer,and  Graphic Designer.
$4675 will go toward compensating all of our Performers and Designers, covering the entire cast and crew for our first two shows.
$2175 will go toward Show Budgets, covering props, costumes, and set pieces to make our shows look amazing, as well as rehearsal space.
Whatever's left after Fractured Atlas' and Indiegogo's deductions will go toward Printing and Marketing costs, helping us get the word out about the shows in the physical world as well as the digital one!




OTHER PERFORMANCES
As if a three-show season weren't enough, BITCRUSHER will be appearing a few other times in the coming months:


On July 25th, we will be producing BITS: a Bitcrusher Variety Show (mentioned in Village Voice) as part of Dixon Place's HOT! Festival. We'll be performing snippets from each of the three shows in our season, as well as showcasing the talents of our many brilliant company members! Reserve a ticket now!

Excerpts from Thud! will be performed in public spaces as Fringe teasers leading up to the FringeNYC festival.

In August, we will be traveling to Odyssey Teen Camp in order to give a free performance of Thud! to campers ages 13-18.

<p>A
nameless novelist arrives in New York intent on getting his first
book published. As he recounts his daily misadventures in a series of
letters to his girl back home, we see through his eyes the colorful
eccentric, vibrant and wildly bizarre characters that make up his new
life, and the tragic events that make up his old one.<br/>In
a musical that is at once funny, and poignant, exhilarating and
tragic, The View From Here received its World Premiere at the 2nd
Annual New York Musical Theatre Festival in September of 2005.</p>

A
nameless novelist arrives in New York intent on getting his first
book published. As he recounts his daily misadventures in a series of
letters to his girl back home, we see through his eyes the colorful
eccentric, vibrant and wildly bizarre characters that make up his new
life, and the tragic events that make up his old one.In
a musical that is at once funny, and poignant, exhilarating and
tragic, The View From Here received its World Premiere at the 2nd
Annual New York Musical Theatre Festival in September of 2005.
""Timothy
Huang's score boasts masterful plot- and character-driven songs and
comedic set pieces... Some have a contemporary throb, but others have
a haunting melodic quality that seems torn from the annals of the
Great American Songbook, populated by such folks as George Gershwin
and Harold Arlen..."" - Ron Cohen, BackstageMeet Doug Clemons!Doug is thrilled to be working on a dream show at Umbrella Group with one of his best friends in the directors chair.

<p>MARYSHELLEYSHOW is a variety show presented by dirtbag teenage geniuses  Mary Shelley and Emily Dickinson, as they struggle with friendship, loneliness, the slipperiness of fame and historical importance, and the desire to host one damned party without Lord Byron messing it all up.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>MARYSHELLEYSHOW got its start at renowned underground Brooklyn art incubator Undiscovered Countries, where it played to a sold out bar in 2014, and then again by popular request for the festival’s third birthday show in 2015.</p>

<p><i>(THIS IS MAINE)</i></p> <p>This is thrilling for us, and comes with unprecedented opportunities: the chance to dig our teeth in and fully produce what has up until now been a DIY, shoestring, seat of our pants workshop experience, and then take the show out of town and present it to brand new audiences who have no prior context for us and our work. To say we are honored to take this on is an understatement, and we couldn’t be more psyched to present MARYSHELLEYSHOW in particular as Undiscovered Countries’ first out of town production.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Live theater is always an unpredictable medium, and producing a show from multiple different states is a challenging process. We’ve assembled a crackerjack team to put this show together; together we’ve done everything from youth theater productions assembled from creation myths to interdimensional graphic novels, to humorous filmed PSAs about coping with premature ejaculation. Barbara has helped to produce over 40 nights of new live performance with Undiscovered Countries, and Jessica is doing great work on the ground in Chicago and Maine to ensure that this project is the best it can be. We’re committed to rolling with punches and using adversity to make the art better, and we have the track record to prove we can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We appreciate everyone who wants this show to succeed, and we entirely understand that not everyone will be able to contribute monetarily to this campaign - as struggling young artists we understand what it is to be broke and unable to support your own work, let alone others’. But not being able to donate doesn’t mean you can’t help! Here are some other ways to get involved.</p> <p><strong>We are gratefully accepting in-kind donations</strong>, of everything from airline miles and gas cards to art supplies and printing services. Have you got a bunch of gold mylar laying around from an art project? Frequent flier miles you don’t plan to use? Access to sweet deals at Chicago businesses that could provide flyer printing, drink tickets for audience members, or pizza for the cast at a discounted rate in exchange for endorsement? A bunch of Jell-O that you bought the last time you had a tooth pulled? A really badass copy of Frankenstein? ANY AND ALL OF THIS HELPS. Perks apply, message us for details.</p> <p><strong>Help Spread the Word!</strong> The success of both funding and and presenting this show will depend on how well we can build grassroots support.

<p><i>(THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE US FEEL WITH YOUR SUPPORT)</i></p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","Hi! We’re Jessica Grace Smith and Barbara K. Begley, friends, former roommates, long time collaborators, donut enthusiasts, and co-creators of new theater piece MARYSHELLEYSHOW.
 

(pictured, Mary and Emily demonstrate Regency Dancing)
 

(pictured: Mary and Emily demonstrate Regency nutrition)
 
MARYSHELLEYSHOW is a variety show presented by dirtbag teenage geniuses  Mary Shelley and Emily Dickinson, as they struggle with friendship, loneliness, the slipperiness of fame and historical importance, and the desire to host one damned party without Lord Byron messing it all up.
 

(pictured: Lord Byron messing it all up) It has musical performances and dance numbers and poetry readings, and it's acerbic and dirty and absurd with a big pained mushy heart.

(Pictured, a big messy mushy heart)
MARYSHELLEYSHOW got its start at renowned underground Brooklyn art incubator Undiscovered Countries, where it played to a sold out bar in 2014, and then again by popular request for the festival’s third birthday show in 2015.
 This year, MARYSHELLEYSHOW has been offered two very exciting engagements: a 10 day residency workshopping the show in August at the Denmark Arts Center in beautiful Denmark Maine, and also a 3-performance slot at the Chicago Fringe Festival in September. 
(THIS IS MAINE) This is thrilling for us, and comes with unprecedented opportunities: the chance to dig our teeth in and fully produce what has up until now been a DIY, shoestring, seat of our pants workshop experience, and then take the show out of town and present it to brand new audiences who have no prior context for us and our work. To say we are honored to take this on is an understatement, and we couldn’t be more psyched to present MARYSHELLEYSHOW in particular as Undiscovered Countries’ first out of town production.

What We Need & What You Get
The two highlights of these plans - focused time and space to build a production in Denmark, and traveling for Chicago Fringe - are also the two main factors in our needing unexpected funds. We are fundraising production costs to pay for travel, set, costumes, and other production costs, and to pay our artists who are doing incredible work on this show, and taking significant time off their survival jobs in ways that a New York based show does not require. Our expenses include:

<h3>Why Daddy Long Legs?</h3>
<p>Jean Webster’s original novel<i> Daddy Long Legs</i> has inspired many creative works, such as the 1955 film adaptation with Fred Astaire, animated shorts and even a sequel, but nothing captures the heart of the story quite so well as the musical.</p>
<p>With music &amp; lyrics by Paul Gordon (<i>Jane Eyre</i>, <i>Emma</i>) and book by John Caird (<i>Les Misérables</i>, <i>Jane Eyre</i>), we are transported back to 1908 to the dreary life of Jerusha Abbott, just before her world turns upside down. The show is so intimate, with only Jerusha and Jervis onstage, and one cannot help but connect with these two characters as they lay their hearts out for all to see.</p>
<p>Because the rights to the show have just become available, this will be the first production of <i>Daddy Long Legs</i> in Los Angeles in several years. It is a new show to many, but one whose message will resonate with all. In a time when it is easy to insulate oneself with people who share the same opinions and life experiences, <i>Daddy Long Legs</i> shows us the value of going out of your comfort zone and the impact generosity can have on another person's life. And we can’t wait to share it with you.</p>

<h3>FLYCATCHER - synopsis</h3>
<p><strong><i>“Needy.  Spiteful.  Ruthless.  And these are a few of her good points.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Flycatcher is a darkly comic thriller which follows a web-woven world, where no one is seen for who they really are:</p>
<p>Madelaine is an awkward waitress with a buried past.</p>
<p>Mae is a forgotten grandmother, who only wants some attention.</p>
<p>Bing is a happy-go-lucky salesman, wanting to spread the American dream.</p>
<p>Olive is a successful but emotionally distant art gallery owner.</p>
<p>These lives will come together when Madelaine tries to pull Bing into her world. However, when Bing sets his sights on Olive, no one and nothing will stop Madelaine from luring any unsuspecting victims into her own psychological traps.</p>
<p>And so unfolds a complex and extraordinary series of events, all cunningly orchestrated by Madelaine and geared to - bit by bit - draw them all under the same roof. </p>
<p>Her schemes are at once hilarious and heart-breaking, but the closer they all become, the more each of their secrets emerge to cause the inevitable and catastrophic clash of identity.</p>
<h3>All About Me</h3>
<p>Thank god it's not all about me!  But if you wanna know, professionally I'm a writer-director, producer and author with a whole lot of experience, creativity and passion (check out <a href=""http://www.masuak.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.masuak.com</a> )  I've had an incredible and eclectic journey creating videos for performers like Take That (I completed ""New Day"", only 3 months ago), Kylie and Spice Girls; directed actresses like Penelope Cruz and Courtney Cox;  am the author of the irreverent spiritual self-help book <i>The Spiritual Slob </i>and have several TV and film projects being pitched around the planet.  My focus is always first and foremost on creating powerful and inspiring entertainment, so as well as all that I'm <i>also</i> at the moment working part time in the 6th Floor kitchen and Bar of the Tate Modern while I continue to hone the creativity that I absolutely live for and to keep things real (you can't get any realer than that!)  While some people think it's a bad move to admit that, I'm proud of whatever it is I do and give my all - whether it's pushing my theatre, film and TV projects out there in the world (FLYCATCHER expects to be two of them), or keeping the guts of the Tate kitchen going and having a laugh and real connection with people I'd have never met had I not taken that mission on.  My take on life is you gotta do what you do with your heart and soul and being and sometimes the curve balls take you to exactly where you never realized you really needed to go, and that's the fun of it.  </p>
<p>A few years back I had the opportunity to see a very rough rendition of FLYCATCHER on a small stage at Theatre 503 and saw how powerful a piece it is. It's funny and it's dark and it speaks of those secret places we hide within ourselves, which is very much a recurring theme in all my long form work.</p>
<p>When just over 5 weeks ago Matthew Parker (artistic director of The Hope) invited me to put FLYCATCHER on stage there, it was a dream come true.  While it came at the worst possible financial moment  I felt that while outer circumstances <i>looked </i>a little hairy-scary, my inner world was screaming a rather undeniable <i>""yes"" .  </i>And so here I am in a nerve-wracking but exciting moment that I'm now involving others in - including you - who I hope can help us reach our goal!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Others</h3>
<p>Luckily with all this short notice, ""I"" am now ""We"", and ""We"" includes the most awesome Assistant Director, actors, technicians and creatives in the industry - check them out here!  <a href=""http://pigseverywhere.wixsite.com/flycatcher-theplay/about3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://pigseverywhere.wixsite.com/flycatcher-theplay/about3</a></p>
<p>And our amazing cast, yes!  Hit this link to check them out, we're so excited to have such an awesome talented ensemble!   <a href=""http://pigseverywhere.wixsite.com/flycatcher-theplay/cast--characters"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://pigseverywhere.wixsite.com/flycatcher-theplay/cast--characters</a></p>
<p>Our indigogo campaign takes us from the moment, right here right now, up to first night on stage at The Hope.  Beyond that we will continue with Phase Two Funding that will see us throughout our run - but for now, your contributions go immediately to getting a rehearsal space for the next month, paying the actors, pulling together props, sets, wardrobe, printing posters and brochures and flyers and marketing materials - and everything needed to shapeshift this creative whirlpool into solid reality.  What you are contributing to is making sure our creatives in this industry get paid for their incredible hard work, which sadly isn’t very common in theatre.</p>
<p>Throughout the campaign we will be keeping you up to speed what your money is helping build, in and out of the rehearsal room! and we can't thank you enough in advance for supporting this!</p>
<h3>Goals!</h3>
<p>WEEK ONE (Now!):  Our rehearsals start TODAY!  In order to snare rehearsal space for the month and start paying the actors (happily a requirement to be at The Hope) we need a minimum of £2,000 so thank you in advance for getting the show truly up and running!  </p>
<p>WEEK TWO:  Paying the actors continues, getting the sets designed and construction starting, pulling in the sound design, composing, animation and design/graphics, marketing and everything needed to start building the play - we will need an additional minimum amount of £2,000</p>
<p>WEEKS THREE &amp; FOUR:  Our rehearsals intensify, requiring more time and more actors being actually together.  Props, wardrobe, and our continuing set building, technical tests and everything running up to our Premiere - £3,000, bringing us up to our ""to First Night"" goal of £6,000</p>
<h3>If We Exceed This Goal</h3>
<p>This is Phase One of our fund raising campaign - we then have a month of performance, so any additional finance will roll over into our 4-week run.  Thank you for being so generous! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you have any ideas let us know!  We are lovers of collaboration as well as welcomers of patronage, so give us a shout!  </p>

And so unfolds a complex and extraordinary series of events, all cunningly orchestrated by Madelaine and geared to - bit by bit - draw them all under the same roof. 
Her schemes are at once hilarious and heart-breaking, but the closer they all become, the more each of their secrets emerge to cause the inevitable and catastrophic clash of identity.
All About Me
Thank god it's not all about me!  But if you wanna know, professionally I'm a writer-director, producer and author with a whole lot of experience, creativity and passion (check out www.masuak.com )  I've had an incredible and eclectic journey creating videos for performers like Take That (I completed ""New Day"", only 3 months ago), Kylie and Spice Girls; directed actresses like Penelope Cruz and Courtney Cox;  am the author of the irreverent spiritual self-help book The Spiritual Slob and have several TV and film projects being pitched around the planet.  My focus is always first and foremost on creating powerful and inspiring entertainment, so as well as all that I'm also at the moment working part time in the 6th Floor kitchen and Bar of the Tate Modern while I continue to hone the creativity that I absolutely live for and to keep things real (you can't get any realer than that!)  While some people think it's a bad move to admit that, I'm proud of whatever it is I do and give my all - whether it's pushing my theatre, film and TV projects out there in the world (FLYCATCHER expects to be two of them), or keeping the guts of the Tate kitchen going and having a laugh and real connection with people I'd have never met had I not taken that mission on.  My take on life is you gotta do what you do with your heart and soul and being and sometimes the curve balls take you to exactly where you never realized you really needed to go, and that's the fun of it.  
A few years back I had the opportunity to see a very rough rendition of FLYCATCHER on a small stage at Theatre 503 and saw how powerful a piece it is. It's funny and it's dark and it speaks of those secret places we hide within ourselves, which is very much a recurring theme in all my long form work.
When just over 5 weeks ago Matthew Parker (artistic director of The Hope) invited me to put FLYCATCHER on stage there, it was a dream come true.  While it came at the worst possible financial moment  I felt that while outer circumstances looked a little hairy-scary, my inner world was screaming a rather undeniable ""yes"" .  And so here I am in a nerve-wracking but exciting moment that I'm now involving others in - including you - who I hope can help us reach our goal!

The Others
Luckily with all this short notice, ""I"" am now ""We"", and ""We"" includes the most awesome Assistant Director, actors, technicians and creatives in the industry - check them out here!  http://pigseverywhere.wixsite.com/flycatcher-theplay/about3
And our amazing cast, yes!  Hit this link to check them out, we're so excited to have such an awesome talented ensemble!   http://pigseverywhere.wixsite.com/flycatcher-theplay/cast--characters
Our indigogo campaign takes us from the moment, right here right now, up to first night on stage at The Hope.  Beyond that we will continue with Phase Two Funding that will see us throughout our run - but for now, your contributions go immediately to getting a rehearsal space for the next month, paying the actors, pulling together props, sets, wardrobe, printing posters and brochures and flyers and marketing materials - and everything needed to shapeshift this creative whirlpool into solid reality.  What you are contributing to is making sure our creatives in this industry get paid for their incredible hard work, which sadly isn’t very common in theatre.
Throughout the campaign we will be keeping you up to speed what your money is helping build, in and out of the rehearsal room! and we can't thank you enough in advance for supporting this!
Goals!
WEEK ONE (Now!):  Our rehearsals start TODAY!  In order to snare rehearsal space for the month and start paying the actors (happily a requirement to be at The Hope) we need a minimum of £2,000 so thank you in advance for getting the show truly up and running!  
WEEK TWO:  Paying the actors continues, getting the sets designed and construction starting, pulling in the sound design, composing, animation and design/graphics, marketing and everything needed to start building the play - we will need an additional minimum amount of £2,000
WEEKS THREE & FOUR:  Our rehearsals intensify, requiring more time and more actors being actually together.  Props, wardrobe, and our continuing set building, technical tests and everything running up to our Premiere - £3,000, bringing us up to our ""to First Night"" goal of £6,000
If We Exceed This Goal
This is Phase One of our fund raising campaign - we then have a month of performance, so any additional finance will roll over into our 4-week run.  Thank you for being so generous!

<h3>The Short and Sweet</h3>
<p>Music is beautiful. Dancing is wonderful. This is the rhythm of joy…and it sets us free! That's why Sugar Swing Dance Club is building a home for jazz, dancing, and music in Edmonton. It will be Edmonton’s only dedicated home for social swing dancing, and a hoppin’ venue for plenty of live jazz to keep us moving. Plus, our studio will provide affordable rehearsal and classroom space for artists, dancers, and musicians of all kinds!</p>
<p>We’re a humble arts community giving it all we got – and it’s gonna take a lot. As a contributor, you not only get sweet perks, but you will also be joining with us to renovate a two-floor facility with the features we all love: spacious rooms, sprung hardwood floors, good acoustics, air conditioning, sound and lighting, and much, much more.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $20,000 to help build out this space and make it beautiful by January 2017.</p>
<p>You can build this house of music and dance by purchasing dance passes, rehearsal time, original artwork, and other fun stuff! Keep reading to learn more about what we're building together.</p>
<h3>A Little Background</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Sugar Swing is a local, family-owned dance club that was established in 2005 by swing dancer Birkley Wisniewski. It is much more than a business: it has grown into a community of amazing people who all love live music and dancing. We offer dance classes in swing (Lindy Hop), jazz, and tap, and host weekly dance socials. We’ve been hired to perform for many notable organizations, including Fort Edmonton Park, the City of Edmonton, the Winspear Centre, and the Alberta Legislature. Ultimately, Sugar Swing encourages a social atmosphere, welcomes beginners, and is open to anyone: no partners required, no dance experience necessary, and no age limits!</p>
<p>In February 2015, we leased the former Old Strathcona Presbyterian Church on Whyte Avenue in Edmonton and turned it into a ballroom. It was a temporary lease as the owner had plans for redevelopment. But the opportunity was too good to pass up: it was a large space in a great location for the right price, so we forged ahead. In August 2016 we were sad to learn that the ballroom's fate arrived: the owner was ready to move ahead with development, and that we had to move out by November 30, 2016.</p>
<p>The good news is that we found a fantastic new space! It is a gorgeous, air-conditioned new building with parking in a great location. And that is what this campaign is all about! It will provide a permanent home for Sugar Swing. Here is where our club will take root and our amazing community will continue to grow! Our dancers can rest assured they will always have a place to enjoy swing music and dancing.</p>
<h3>How to Get There</h3>
<p>Our new building is located just off Whyte Avenue, on 100th Street. Still close to the action, and very accessible to transit. The building itself has two floors and is brand new. It's so new that it needs quite a lot of work to become functional! Your contributions will go to finishing the build and adding amenities. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprung, hardwood dance floors both upstairs and down</li>
<li>Electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems</li>
<li>Washrooms</li>
<li>Kitchenettes and bars</li>
<li>Interior walls and partitions to create all the rooms, including an office, staff room, and powder room</li>
<li>Lighting and sound equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>We're a hands-on community, and much of the work will be done by the owners, their friends and family, and our amazing volunteers. However there are parts of the job that require skilled tradespeople with permits in order to get the work done properly and safely. Funds will be prioritized to projects that are most essential to the operation of the building -- so walls, floors, HVAC, electrical, plumbing. As those get taken care of, we'll move toward things like equipment and aesthetics.</p>
<h3>*Update* Push Goals</h3>
<p>When we reach these campaign milestones, we'll commit to providing some awesome experiences for our contributors and community! Spread the word to help us get there, and enjoy these sweet benefits:</p>
<p><strong>$15,000: Contributors and Volunteers Hot Tub Dance Party</strong></p>
<p>We'll throw a sweet hot tub dance party with free food and drink for everyone who contributed to the campaign, as well as those who've volunteered their time to the space. Share to help make it happen!</p>
<p><strong>$20,000: Live Music Every Friday for THREE MONTHS</strong></p>
<p>We'll arrange for a live jazz trio to play at every Friday social dance for three months! Admission will be very reasonable. Tell your friends to help secure three months of live music for your dancing pleasure!</p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>We're offering a wide variety of perks that are fun, unique and practical! If you love dancing, why not become part of the legacy and have your name engraved on the ballroom floor? Or if you are an artist, secure some sweet rehearsal space for when we're ready to go? You can also indulge in a bit of original artwork, or get a limited-edition, contributors-only t-shirt! Stay tuned as we roll out more fun perks over the course of the campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Dancing and music brings people together. Our vision is to see a beautiful ballroom filled with people dancing, socializing, and having fun to amazing live music. Contributing to this project helps to create this vision for yourself, your friends, and people who need joy in their lives! We're not kidding when we say that dance brings people together: this past year, three couples who met through Sugar Swing got married!</p>
<p>Sugar Swing has successfully renovated two former spaces within the last five years, all on its own dime, with the help of both skilled hired labour and volunteers. The owner is a former engineer involved in the building industry, and the community has generously contributed their time towards the build out of those spaces.</p>
<p>We were able to grow substantially under those prior projects, but unfortunately not enough time has lapsed to replenish Sugar Swing’s financial resources. Both of our former leases required less renovation work than the one now, and while they were meant to be temporary, they both ended much earlier than anticipated. Now we finally have a place that we’ll have for a minimum of 10 to 20 years, or more! This project will be permanent, and is significantly larger in scope.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What to Expect</h3>
<p>Renovations often take longer and cost more than expected, but we are determined to be partially operational by mid December 2016 and fully completed with renovations by February 2017. As we undertake this journey, we ask for your patience regarding project delays or changes to the plan. We'll do our best to keep you informed about what we're working on! The good news is that we have considerable experience with renovating spaces, especially after turning a big ol' Presbyterian church into a ballroom. And Birkley, the director, has built no less than <i>two</i> sprung dance floors.</p>

</div></div>","The Short and Sweet
Music is beautiful. Dancing is wonderful. This is the rhythm of joy…and it sets us free! That's why Sugar Swing Dance Club is building a home for jazz, dancing, and music in Edmonton. It will be Edmonton’s only dedicated home for social swing dancing, and a hoppin’ venue for plenty of live jazz to keep us moving. Plus, our studio will provide affordable rehearsal and classroom space for artists, dancers, and musicians of all kinds!
We’re a humble arts community giving it all we got – and it’s gonna take a lot. As a contributor, you not only get sweet perks, but you will also be joining with us to renovate a two-floor facility with the features we all love: spacious rooms, sprung hardwood floors, good acoustics, air conditioning, sound and lighting, and much, much more.
Our goal is to raise $20,000 to help build out this space and make it beautiful by January 2017.
You can build this house of music and dance by purchasing dance passes, rehearsal time, original artwork, and other fun stuff! Keep reading to learn more about what we're building together.
A Little Background

Sugar Swing is a local, family-owned dance club that was established in 2005 by swing dancer Birkley Wisniewski. It is much more than a business: it has grown into a community of amazing people who all love live music and dancing. We offer dance classes in swing (Lindy Hop), jazz, and tap, and host weekly dance socials. We’ve been hired to perform for many notable organizations, including Fort Edmonton Park, the City of Edmonton, the Winspear Centre, and the Alberta Legislature. Ultimately, Sugar Swing encourages a social atmosphere, welcomes beginners, and is open to anyone: no partners required, no dance experience necessary, and no age limits!
In February 2015, we leased the former Old Strathcona Presbyterian Church on Whyte Avenue in Edmonton and turned it into a ballroom. It was a temporary lease as the owner had plans for redevelopment. But the opportunity was too good to pass up: it was a large space in a great location for the right price, so we forged ahead. In August 2016 we were sad to learn that the ballroom's fate arrived: the owner was ready to move ahead with development, and that we had to move out by November 30, 2016.
The good news is that we found a fantastic new space! It is a gorgeous, air-conditioned new building with parking in a great location. And that is what this campaign is all about! It will provide a permanent home for Sugar Swing. Here is where our club will take root and our amazing community will continue to grow! Our dancers can rest assured they will always have a place to enjoy swing music and dancing.
How to Get There
Our new building is located just off Whyte Avenue, on 100th Street. Still close to the action, and very accessible to transit. The building itself has two floors and is brand new. It's so new that it needs quite a lot of work to become functional! Your contributions will go to finishing the build and adding amenities. This includes:

Sprung, hardwood dance floors both upstairs and down
Electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems
Washrooms
Kitchenettes and bars
Interior walls and partitions to create all the rooms, including an office, staff room, and powder room
Lighting and sound equipment

We're a hands-on community, and much of the work will be done by the owners, their friends and family, and our amazing volunteers. However there are parts of the job that require skilled tradespeople with permits in order to get the work done properly and safely. Funds will be prioritized to projects that are most essential to the operation of the building -- so walls, floors, HVAC, electrical, plumbing. As those get taken care of, we'll move toward things like equipment and aesthetics.
*Update* Push Goals
When we reach these campaign milestones, we'll commit to providing some awesome experiences for our contributors and community! Spread the word to help us get there, and enjoy these sweet benefits:
$15,000: Contributors and Volunteers Hot Tub Dance Party
We'll throw a sweet hot tub dance party with free food and drink for everyone who contributed to the campaign, as well as those who've volunteered their time to the space. Share to help make it happen!
