<p>Fred Isch and I signed a lease for what would eventually become <strong>The Flaming Buoy Filet Co.</strong> at 1100 Packer Street on September 9, 2009. We opened–less than two months later–on October 23, 2009. A Friday. Fantasy Fest weekend.</p>
<p>And we had no idea what we were doing: no menu, no tables, no chairs, no silverware, no employees, no kitchen equipment, no experience with permits, inspections, or licenses.</p>
<p>You know, like that song in the musical Hair.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know the one.</p>
<p>The one that ends with, ""I got this, and I got that, and something, something, hair.""</p>
<p>Nina Simone sang it on one of her albums.</p>
<p>But, I digress. (That's code for Fred telling me to cut the Hair part.)</p>
<p>Hair.</p>
<p>Part.</p>
<p>There's a joke in there somewhere.</p>
<p>Then came The New York Times, People Magazine, Out Magazine, USA Today, TripAdvisor, Yelp, Grindr, etc... Those two guys who worked at [Restaurant's Name Redacted] we ran into at Don's Place that bet we wouldn't last three months. (Bitches better have my money. No, really. That money would be very useful right now.)</p>
<p>We did the impossible, and that made us mighty.</p>
<p>We realized entrees were just sandwiches without the bread.</p>
<p>Today, however, we find ourselves nearly four months and counting deep into opening a new location at 424 Eaton Street. (For perspective, Brett Kavanaugh was nominated and confirmed to The Supreme Court of the United States in less time.)</p>
<p>Following the financial hit of Hurricane Irma and the sale of our building, we found this a necessary, if not wholly inevitable move.</p>
<p>(Cue sad music. Think Sarah McLachlan and busted up dogs.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite our best efforts in planning a smooth transition, opening this new location has taken a rather challenging turn.</p>
<p>Whether opening a new business, or, thinking, like...Sex. Money. Power. Fire. Choking. Being dragged behind a speed boat. It's all the same thing–you find yourself helplessly facing forces that are beyond your control or influence.</p>
<p>Thus, we find ourselves here, asking for your help.</p>
<p>Financial assistance from the pretender to the throne of Nigeria has gone horribly astray. Should you run into Fred, please, gently welcome him home. He's quite easily startled as of late.</p>
<p>So, to borrow a phrase: Help us...You're our only hope.</p>
<p>As of October 1, The Flaming Buoy Filet Co. is no longer generating an income; income that fueled our move to Eaton Street; income that supported a staff of ten and provided for their families and bad habits; income that Fred and I always put back into The Flaming Buoy Filet Co. to make her a better dining experience.</p>
<p>Remember when our sandwiches had no bread?</p>
<p>We expect this situation to remain unchanged throughout the month of October. Perhaps, longer.</p>
<p>Our goal–our pledge–is to remain intensely focused and have finished this project at 424 Eaton Street as quickly as possible; making certain that the staff of The Flaming Buoy Filet Co. not needlessly worry for their future employment through these unexpected bureaucratic delays and surprise expenses incurred while undertaking this rather–we'd hoped–banal undertaking.</p>
<p>(Cue uplifting music. Think the music in the second half of any anti-depressent commercial.)</p>
<p>In exchange for your investment through this month, we are willing to offer these great incentives:</p>
<p><strong>Donate $20.00 and receive a $25.00 Gift Certificate</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Donate $50.00 and receive a $65.00 Gift Certificate</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Donate $75.00 and receive a $100.00 Gift Certificate</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>For every $100.00 donation up to $900.00, receive $150.00 in Gift Certificates</strong> (in any increments you like, because Gift Certificates make great gifts), and a big hug.</p>
<p><strong>Donate $200.00 and receive a $250.00 Gift Certificate and Guest Host</strong> any evening of your choice. Enjoy all the special perks that come with that position. Perks like:  a staff dinner of your choice; too many shift drinks; polishing glassware and silverware; and unwinding with the staff at the round table with a nice bottle(s) of wine when all the guests are gone and the front doors are locked. A night at the round table is no legend. I have the videos to prove it.</p>
<p><strong>Donate $400.00 and enjoy a Free Dinner with 4 Other Guests and any Staff Member</strong> of your choice:  Brian (Dirty Jesus)! Jay! Jill! Kyle! Scot! or, please, Brian (Dirty Jesus)!</p>
<p><strong>Donate $500.00? Star Wars</strong>. As many of you know, because we don't shut up about it, The Flaming Buoy Filet Co. closes up with the release of each new Star Wars film. Join the nerd side with the staff and friends and plus ones on this very special evening. With your donation, you'll be provided not only with two tickets to Star Wars IX, but you will join the staff in our pre-gaming festivities at The Flaming Buoy Filet Co. Warning: This can get messy. May the force be with you. You'll need it.</p>
<p><strong>For every $1000.00 donation up to $2000, receive $1750.00 in Gift Certificates</strong> (in any increment you like. Want 1,750 one dollar gift certificates? Done.).</p>
<p><strong>Donate $3000.00 and enjoy a Private Party</strong> for you and 30 of your friends at The Flaming Buoy Filet Co. with a maximum spend of $4000.00 on any night, Monday through Thursday, excluding holidays. (Arrangements will, of course, need to be made prior to confirm availability.)</p>
<p><strong>Donate $5000.00 and enjoy a Private Party</strong> any day of the week for you and 40 of your friends at The Flaming Buoy Filet Co. any night of the week, excluding holidays. (Arrangements will, of course, need to be made prior to confirm availability.)</p>

<h3>2 guys fighting massive corporations</h3>
<p>Through the opposition of an establishment biased industry, two regular guys emerging from humble roots in Chicago's south suburbs have figured out the key to making the world's smoothest vodka.  We knew going in that there would be obstacles to selling into a competitive market, but we didn't know that the cards would <i>actually</i> be stacked against us.  To date, we have weathered a bumpy but drastically upward trajectory as we navigate our way through the complicated world of spirits sales and distribution.  We have survived the rigid culture of corporate corruption, entrenched distributors and predatory brokers all while penetrating a seemingly unbreakable market guarded by the deep pockets of international  conglomerates.  </p>
<p>Through it all we emerged on the other side.  Now, the only thing blocking our path to the national market, and bringing our superior products to the masses, is a national marketing campaign.</p>
<h3>A quick look at the world's smoothest vodka</h3>
<h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480461200/cfzsbrbmf3mch8gdnako.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </h3>
<p>We started with a simple goal:  to create the world's smoothest vodka at a price that the masses can afford.  4 years later we have developed a gold medal winning vodka along with adding 9 flavors.  Through thousands of tastings and blind tests with national brands, CD Vodka and our flavored varieties have proven to be at the top.</p>
<h3>
<strong>The Torta Bianca difference</strong>  </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480461389/e67ya0bfrw2zhjsvrrcb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It is well known that there are several vodkas on the national market, but there is only one Torta Bianca.  In 2014 we added Torta Bianca to our product lineup.  Torta Bianca is a cream liqueur flavored with white cake and chocolate truffle...and of course it is made with our CD Vodka base. The decadent yet neutral flavor profile makes Torta Bianca a perfect option for creating custom cocktails and tastes great alone.</p>
<h3>Our new products</h3>
<p>Popular demand by our fans has driven the creation of our newest product, Torta Rojo.  Torta Rojo is a close relative to Torta Bianca.  It shares many of the same decadent flavor qualities, but features a strawberry profile and will be produced in a red bottle with black and white decoration.  To accompany Torta Rojo, we will be releasing CD Strawberry Flavored Vodka simultaneously.  </p>
<div><h3>Helping a small company never tasted so good</h3></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>We are seeking to raise $145,000 for the filming and airing of our national television commercial along with finishing up the development of our two newest products.</li>
<li>All backing options include a voucher for at least one bottle of  Torta Rojo or CD Strawberry Flavored Vodka (or a combination with any of our existing products).  </li>
<li>Attending one of our live events will place you in our commercial; from being in the group scenes to a speaking line - we want our fans to be part of this experience.  </li>
<li>Even if we do not reach our entire goal, we will utilize any raised funds to complete the development of Torta Rojo and CD Strawberry Vodka.  Remaining capital will be utilized for a paid social marketing campaign.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Our budget</h3>
<p>We have spent months preparing for our national marketing campaign.  In addition to the funding we have already put into the effort and those upcoming, funds raised from the Indiegogo campaign will be utilized in the following ways.</p>
<p>$25,000 - commercial production</p>
<p>$10,000 - R&amp;D of new products</p>
<p>$60,000 - fulfillment of perks</p>
<p>$42,000 - added to our projected commercial air time budget  </p>
</div>
<h3>Our connection with our fans </h3>
<p>We plan to move to the next level in the same way that we have grown to selling in 5 states...by attracting our fans to tangible events.  On a small scale, we have introduced tens of thousands of fans to our products through ""hands on"" events, such as our innovative martini making classes.  Now we will expand on that effort by hosting a live music event during which we will film our first national television commercial featuring the launch of 2 new products. </p>
<p>Our plan is simple, to capture the amazing response we have recognized over the last four years on film while fans and backers enjoy our cocktails at a live music show.  Don't have time to commit to an on site event?  Not a problem, chose one of our ""product release options"" and get the first crack at one of our limited edition new product releases.</p>
<h3>Our connection with our community </h3>
<p>Along our path, we have retained focus on the responsibility of business to the community.  We have a drawer filled with thank you letters from various charitable organizations in response to the thousands of bottles we have donated for baskets, raffles, fund raising events and individuals.  In addition, our products are manufactured from American made raw goods.</p>
<p>In 2014 we launched Warrior Vodka (<a href=""http://warriorvodka.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.warriorvodka.org</a>).  All proceeds from sales of Warrior Vodka are donated to the (501 c3) charitable organization - Cheers to The Warriors, which offers both financial and non-financial assistance to U.S. veterans in need.  Common sense might say that releasing a competing product into our own market isn't the best business decision, however we believe strongly in serving those who need help the most.   </p>

</div><div><p>Through re-investment we have positioned our company to continue our path at the next level.  We will continue to stick to our values of supporting local communities and our philanthropic efforts.  </p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have always safeguarded and meticulously re-invested each dollar earned by our business into expansion and we will continue to do so throughout this campaign.  With that said, we know there are still stumbling blocks ahead of us as we continue to grow.      </p>
</div><div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Top Deck Towers Cards &amp; Games is a fun, safe, and reliable place for all your tabletop gaming needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently there are no shops that provide Fantasy Hobby Gaming experience on the North side of Tucson. We plan on changing this with a store dedicated to friendly customer service, knowledgeable staff, and community ties. Our owners have a very diverse and extensive knowledge of some of the most popular tabletop fantasy games. </li>
<li>These funds will be used to pay for the first years rent, utilities, payroll, initial inventory, and emergency cash as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are trying to raise $5000 to help get our business operations started. Donations will help cover the costs of business from rent to payroll and everything in between.</li>
<li>All of our perks are designed to make you fell like part of the Top Deck Team. </li>
<li>If we don't meet our goal, all funds raised will go to taking care of what they can. Every little bit helps in order to get us to the end goal.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Tucson, Arizona area has only a few Fantasy Tabletop Game Stores. Most are located in the Central and South-Central portion of town. This can make it difficult for people who enjoy playing fantasy games, and live on the North Side of town including Marana, Oro Valley, and North Tucson.<br/><br/>Currently there are no shops that provide well rounded Tabletop Fantasy Gaming experiences on the North side of Tucson. We plan on changing this with a store dedicated to friendly customer service, knowledgeable staff, and community ties.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are a first time business startup, we will face many challenges. </p>
<ul>
<li>Both owners have business experience managing and running someone else's store, now it's our turn to do it for ourselves.</li>
<li>We'll allways have our ears to the ground listening for what our customer's want.</li>

Top Deck Towers Cards & Games is a fun, safe, and reliable place for all your tabletop gaming needs.

Currently there are no shops that provide Fantasy Hobby Gaming experience on the North side of Tucson. We plan on changing this with a store dedicated to friendly customer service, knowledgeable staff, and community ties. Our owners have a very diverse and extensive knowledge of some of the most popular tabletop fantasy games. 
These funds will be used to pay for the first years rent, utilities, payroll, initial inventory, and emergency cash as needed.

 

What We Need & What You Get

We are trying to raise $5000 to help get our business operations started. Donations will help cover the costs of business from rent to payroll and everything in between.
All of our perks are designed to make you fell like part of the Top Deck Team. 
If we don't meet our goal, all funds raised will go to taking care of what they can. Every little bit helps in order to get us to the end goal.


The Impact
The Tucson, Arizona area has only a few Fantasy Tabletop Game Stores. Most are located in the Central and South-Central portion of town. This can make it difficult for people who enjoy playing fantasy games, and live on the North Side of town including Marana, Oro Valley, and North Tucson.Currently there are no shops that provide well rounded Tabletop Fantasy Gaming experiences on the North side of Tucson. We plan on changing this with a store dedicated to friendly customer service, knowledgeable staff, and community ties.

Risks & Challenges
We are a first time business startup, we will face many challenges. 

Both owners have business experience managing and running someone else's store, now it's our turn to do it for ourselves.
We'll allways have our ears to the ground listening for what our customer's want.

<h3><b>An adventure of the heart</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>At some point in life
you should embark on an adventure, something that you've always dreamed about. For us this is the Mongol Rally: an adventure that also gives us an opportunity to do good along the way. </p>
<p>We are supporting a good cause by
doing something that many people would label 'insane'. And it is (both a good
cause and slightly insane). We’re going to take a small under-powered car, like
the one our grannies used to drive, and drive it 14000 kilometers to the other
side of the world - to raise money for charity and increase awareness of the importance of supporting child welfare in remote places.</p>
<p>This indiegogo page is to get a little support for equipment and stuff we need to have a decent chance of completing the rally, but we guarantee that at least 50% of  the support money raised on indiegogo will go to charity.</p>
<p>If you want to make sure that your every single cent goes straight to charity, we have a dedicated fundraiser <b><a href=""http://www.sos-barnbyar.se/insamling/visa/1089"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> </b>(unfortunately it's in Swedish but you can use Google translate or look at the translations at the bottom of this page). Whichever path you choose with your donation, we hope you'll check out the cool stuff we're giving to those who support our adventure - all listed on the right side of this page. </p>
<p>If you want to support with things rather than money, check out the list of stuff we need  (further down on this page).</p>

<p></p>
<p>Organized by <a href=""http://www.theadventurists.com/mongol-rally"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the
Adventurists</a>, the Mongol Rally launches teams of adventurous people
crammed into tiny cars, and sends them on their way from London to Mongolia. Teams
and cars have very different age, background and pedigree – but one thing they
all have in common is that every single car is designed for a very very
different purpose. It's not a race and it doesn't have a prize, the outcome is purely the money raised, and the adventure.</p>
<p>In the words of the organizers:<br/><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">There’s no backup, no support and no set route; just you, your fellow adventurists and a tiny car you bought from a scrapyard for £11.50. If nothing goes wrong, everything has gone wrong. Bollocks to tarmac, ABS and gadgets that help you find your navel. The Mongol Rally is about getting lost, using your long neglected wits, raising shedloads of cash for charity and scraping into the finish line with your vehicle in tatters and a wild grin smeared across your grubby face. Neither your car, nor your life, will ever be the same again. </i><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The rules of the Rally are gloriously simple…<br/></i><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">1.

An adventure of the heart

At some point in life
you should embark on an adventure, something that you've always dreamed about. For us this is the Mongol Rally: an adventure that also gives us an opportunity to do good along the way. 
We are supporting a good cause by
doing something that many people would label 'insane'. And it is (both a good
cause and slightly insane). We’re going to take a small under-powered car, like
the one our grannies used to drive, and drive it 14000 kilometers to the other
side of the world - to raise money for charity and increase awareness of the importance of supporting child welfare in remote places.
This indiegogo page is to get a little support for equipment and stuff we need to have a decent chance of completing the rally, but we guarantee that at least 50% of  the support money raised on indiegogo will go to charity.
If you want to make sure that your every single cent goes straight to charity, we have a dedicated fundraiser here (unfortunately it's in Swedish but you can use Google translate or look at the translations at the bottom of this page). Whichever path you choose with your donation, we hope you'll check out the cool stuff we're giving to those who support our adventure - all listed on the right side of this page. 
If you want to support with things rather than money, check out the list of stuff we need  (further down on this page).
The rally, the car and the master plan

Organized by the
Adventurists, the Mongol Rally launches teams of adventurous people
crammed into tiny cars, and sends them on their way from London to Mongolia. Teams
and cars have very different age, background and pedigree – but one thing they
all have in common is that every single car is designed for a very very
different purpose. It's not a race and it doesn't have a prize, the outcome is purely the money raised, and the adventure.
In the words of the organizers:There’s no backup, no support and no set route; just you, your fellow adventurists and a tiny car you bought from a scrapyard for £11.50. If nothing goes wrong, everything has gone wrong. Bollocks to tarmac, ABS and gadgets that help you find your navel. The Mongol Rally is about getting lost, using your long neglected wits, raising shedloads of cash for charity and scraping into the finish line with your vehicle in tatters and a wild grin smeared across your grubby face. Neither your car, nor your life, will ever be the same again. The rules of the Rally are gloriously simple…1. You can only take a farcically small vehicle2. You’re completely on your own3. You've got to raise a £1000 for charity 

Our car in its 'natural habitat'





This is our car, a '99 Renault Clio. It
was designed to be an affordable city car with a minimum of extras. What we
intend to do with this lovely piece of (French) equipment is the exact opposite of why it was conceived in the first place – driving it a very long distance and taking it way way way out of
its' city comfort zone. 
We bought it off an old lady who only used it to church on Sundays - at least that's what the sales guy told us. It took less than a week for the first problem to arise (broken parking brake wire)  but we think our little gem will make it all the way…
The Plan
The Rally starts in London, but we will commence our journey in Stockholm, Sweden. From there we will drive to London, and onwards through France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan, Russia (again) and into Mongolia and Ulan Bator. From there we will do the final push up to Ulan Ude (Russia yet again). If all goes as planned (haha) we will make the journey in roughly 30 days.

We would have liked to use a more international version, but apparently only the Swedish arm of SOS Children's Villages provide support for these personal online fundraisers...

Anyway, here are the screens you'll see with English translation. If you're still not sure how to do it, please get in touch with us and we'll help you out. 
The payment is of course secure.

<p><b>Our
Background and Overview – Campaign Description</b></p>
<p>Heavenly Sweets Bake Shop and Café
is a traditional bakery serving the most delectable baked goods and savory
soups, salads, and sandwiches.  Our products are made with the highest
quality ingredients and baked with love.</p>
<p>Hi…I'm Francine and I started
Heavenly Sweets Bake Shop a little over a year ago when my prayers were
answered for God to show me my purpose.  I have always cooked and baked
for as long as I can remember.  I come from a long line of excellent cooks
including my mom Florida and my grandmas Mary and Sally.  They are all
from the south, were raised on a farm, and possess some of the “meanest”
recipes around.  Well it’s a blessing because I too inherited the cooking
bug.</p>
<p>After many years of working in
corporate America as an IT Software Developer and Project Manager, I knew that
there had to be more for me.  Although I am thankful for the
opportunities, my passion lied elsewhere.  Then almost 2 years ago, I
began baking regularly again.  I always enjoyed baking, cooking, and
serving, so this became my safe haven…bringing solace for me.  So I baked,
and baked, and baked.  Everyone loved being my guinea pigs of course and I
have always received positive feedback on my baked goods.  I had a few family
and friends who worked for various corporations, so I sent some of my treats to
their corporate meetings.  To my surprise, I received rave reviews…along
with a few orders.  However, I wasn’t in business yet!  Both my
parents and I have owned businesses before, so it didn’t shock me that my
entrepreneurial spirit kicked in.  I needed a name for the business. 
I always keep God in the midst of everything that I do and I knew that the next
time I owned a business; I wanted to make sure it helped others.  So
Heavenly Sweets Bake Shop was born and now here we are determined to open its
first location.</p>
<p>Heavenly Sweets Bake Shop intends on
helping the community in several ways.  First, we will source the
ingredients for our products from local vendors as much as possible.  We
will also provide additional jobs, which we hope will also help the
economy.  Additionally, we want to be a help in the fight against
hunger.  Our plan is to daily provide perfectly good food, such as soups
and sandwiches that would otherwise go to waste to various shelters and the
homeless in need.  Eventually, we plan on procuring an “Angel Truck”,
which will make deliveries to these locations and individuals.</p>
<p>I feel so blessed and want to be a
blessing to others.  God bless and thank you for all of your help!!! 
We truly appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>How
can you be an Angel for us?</b></p>
<p>When the concept of Heavenly Sweets
Bake Shop was born, it was always my initial intentions to keep debt to a
minimum, so that focus can remain on running the business instead of the stress
of paying back debt.  I have put a great deal of my own money into this
venture, however, as a single mom, it has become increasingly tougher to fund
both a start up and run a household.  This is why I am requesting your
help.</p>
<p>We are asking for $5,000.  The
funds raised will go towards some minor renovations and décor of the
bakery/café space, purchase of various equipment needed to operate (convection
oven, display cases, commercial sink, and refrigerator), supplies needed for
operation (boxes, packaging), and some of the licenses and fees that may result
from opening a food establishment. </p>
<p>If
you choose to donate, you will be able to select one of our delectable perks
listed in this campaign.  Among our perks are a dozen of our signature cupcakes,
a t-shirt displaying our new logo, or your chance to create your very own
cupcake! We are sure that whatever perk you select, you will surely enjoy it.</p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges, but our Angels are watching over us!</b></p>
<p>Some of life’s greatest achievements
came with risk.<span>  Risk isn’t necessarily
always negative.  For me, increases my
faith and make me stronger and more hopeful. 
It is known that the restaurant business can be risky.  However, with a solid plan in place and once
again, lots of faith and support, we have the tools to mitigate almost any risk
that should arise.  The knowledge I gained
while earning my MBA, as a previous business owner, and my knowledge and over
12 years of experience as a Project Manager, gives me the proper training to
handle the risks and challenges while successfully organizing and running a
business.  Additionally, I have multiple
years of experience in the food industry in various roles, including 3 years of
managing the bakery my family owned. 
Being in the restaurant business can be stressful and risky in various
aspects, but with the support of our Angels, that’s you and our community, and

<h2>The Story - an uplifting community project.</h2>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>The Sharing Shed - a place for the local community to get together, have a space in which to create, sell and promote themselves and their art. Ideally we would like to have the whole building be eco-friendly with using only solar and wind energy. The bistro will only use produce grown on the property with a re-usable energy system. The whole property will be a waste-free environment where all materials get's re-used into either art, furniture or to sustain growth of produce. </p>
<p>Local artists/carpenters/health specialists will share a space where everything they create or build will be displayed and put up for sale to establish a supporting community. We've got the perfect location, now we just need to raise the funds to buy the building, do a make over and get all of the artists participating a decent spot to exhibit and sell their goods. A self-sustaining coffee shop/bistro as well as a carpentry shop, artists studios, secondhand furniture and antique finds shops. Local crafters will be able to display and sell their goods without having to pay a fee towards the space they use for displaying. Photography courses will be on offer as well as art classes and basic carpentry classes. Many more possibilities for all creatives to have the chance to put back into the community and for the community to support local talent. </p>
</div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>All funding will go towards buying a building, setting up a workspace for all artists and contributors, marketing and buying stock.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>A permanent art-market in the area would help local artists to earn an income without having to over-price their stock as it would be a self-sustaining income. If we can buy the building and do all the necessary building and set-up upfront the artists won't need to be paying out a monthly amount to have their art on display. Many local artists have to display their art on street corners or alongside the road and do not have the funds to have a permanent place to display their works to tourists etc. The Sharing Shed is intended to uplift the local art community and draw tourists. All furniture etc within the bistro would be made by local carpenters and be up for sale - everything within the Sharing Shed would be for sale and artists and creators will have a space to teach their skills to others interested in doing the same. A lifestyle area for health and fitness enthusiasts will be available as well as a Photography School. The local bistro would be self-sustaining with growing their own vegetables on the land and supplying vegetable to be sold to the community. The goal is to have all produce needed to run the bistro grown on site, except of course any meat produce. </p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

The Sharing Shed - a place for the local community to get together, have a space in which to create, sell and promote themselves and their art. Ideally we would like to have the whole building be eco-friendly with using only solar and wind energy. The bistro will only use produce grown on the property with a re-usable energy system. The whole property will be a waste-free environment where all materials get's re-used into either art, furniture or to sustain growth of produce. 
Local artists/carpenters/health specialists will share a space where everything they create or build will be displayed and put up for sale to establish a supporting community. We've got the perfect location, now we just need to raise the funds to buy the building, do a make over and get all of the artists participating a decent spot to exhibit and sell their goods. A self-sustaining coffee shop/bistro as well as a carpentry shop, artists studios, secondhand furniture and antique finds shops. Local crafters will be able to display and sell their goods without having to pay a fee towards the space they use for displaying. Photography courses will be on offer as well as art classes and basic carpentry classes. Many more possibilities for all creatives to have the chance to put back into the community and for the community to support local talent. 

   What We Need & What You Get All funding will go towards buying a building, setting up a workspace for all artists and contributors, marketing and buying stock.
    The Impact A permanent art-market in the area would help local artists to earn an income without having to over-price their stock as it would be a self-sustaining income. If we can buy the building and do all the necessary building and set-up upfront the artists won't need to be paying out a monthly amount to have their art on display. Many local artists have to display their art on street corners or alongside the road and do not have the funds to have a permanent place to display their works to tourists etc. The Sharing Shed is intended to uplift the local art community and draw tourists. All furniture etc within the bistro would be made by local carpenters and be up for sale - everything within the Sharing Shed would be for sale and artists and creators will have a space to teach their skills to others interested in doing the same. A lifestyle area for health and fitness enthusiasts will be available as well as a Photography School. The local bistro would be self-sustaining with growing their own vegetables on the land and supplying vegetable to be sold to the community. The goal is to have all produce needed to run the bistro grown on site, except of course any meat produce.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h1><b>Bring the first E-Sports
Gaming Bar to South Florida</b></h1>
<p>Help us raise the money necessary to secure a location
and equipment to open an innovative new e-gaming bar.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our Story</b><br/></p>
<p>My name is Matt, and my
business partner is John. We are looking to use indiegogo to bring gamers of
all types to South Florida's first E-sports Gaming Bar. </p>
<p>As part of the gamer's
generation ourselves, we have been actively involved in the gaming community
for a number of years. We have combined our love for gaming with our experience
in the service industry to start our own business. </p>
<p>John and I have been working to bring this
dream to reality for some time now, and have come to the realization that we
need additional funding to make it happen. We are passionate about opening our
E-Sports Gaming Bar and know that it will be a unique establishment for the
Southern Florida area.</p>
<p>An e-sports bar is similar to a traditional
sports bar, but instead of broadcasting sports like football, basketball, etc.,
internet-based video games are broadcasted. In addition, the bar can offer
events where players and spectators to come watch and compete. </p>
<h1><b><i>OPENING EARLY 2016!!!</i></b></h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The Impact:</b></p>
<p>Our campaign is important because we will use every penny
donated to go to the business, and provide the very best place to play, drink,
or watch an e-sports stream. (Such as WOW, Street Fighter, LOL, StarCraft, and more!).
</p>
<p>As entrepreneurs familiar with the gaming community, we
have seen that there is an opportunity in the area for this kind of gaming bar. In the
past, E-Sports has mostly been an at-home activity. Our goal is to bring the
concept of a sports bar with Video Games, so the gaming community has a place
to network, play their favorite games, and hone their skills against their
peers.</p>
<p>The bar will be a great place for gamers to drink, play a
game with a friend, or even to just watch people play. Video games and ""e-sports""
are quickly gaining in popularity, and the fact that so many gamers will leave
the house to watch OTHER gamers play video games is astonishing. Just like
regular sports, there are many gamers that have huge fans and followers. These
popular gamers are also signing autographs, so it just shows how big e-sports
really is!</p>
<p><b>Some
Examples:</b></p>
<p>At Chicago's Ignite Gaming Lounge, crowds lined up before
midnight, not to play video games, but to watch e-sports such as the League of
Legends world championship being played half-a-world away, in South Korea.</p>
<p>And
in Seoul more than 40,000 people packed into a stadium to watch the video game
competitions live. It was in South Korea where the video game competition
phenomenon was coined as ""e-Sports"".</p>
<p><br/>
Our bar will provide a great atmosphere and an environment that encourages
gamers to be gamers. In addition, we will be able to create an atmosphere that
welcomes spectators to come and watch their favorite gamers fight against their
competitors. We want to break into this market and be the first to provide this
innovative entertainment to our area!</p>
<p><span><b>What we Need &amp; What You Get: </b></span></p>
<p>We've already put in thousands of our
own money, but we need help raising our last $50,000 so we can make our dream a
reality. The money will go towards securing our location, game consoles, opening
inventory, and equipment needed for the bar to operate. While this may seem like
a lot, with the power of crowd funding we can easily make this a reality for
just the investment of one night out with friends!</p>
<p>We want our potential donors to know
that we take their investment in our business seriously. We know there are many
projects to donate to, and we appreciate your support. To show that we
appreciate your generosity, all contributors are invited to our pre-launch
party after we hit our goal. We can't wait to meet you all!</p>
<p>Donations to our project will not just
be giving us the funds to open our business but to keep us going in the crucial
first months after opening the doors.  
</p>
<p><span><b>Other Ways To Help</b></span></p>
<p>If you can't donate at this time, there are
still many ways you can help! Please share our story via social media, email
and word of mouth to tell your friends about our campaign. If you live in the
Southern Florida area, spread the word that the first E-Sports Gaming Bar is
coming soon! Thank you in advance! </p>

<br/><p>We foresee a time, not far in the future, where we will not only have a fully functional child-care and adult skills development centre which is operated by and for the local community, but also an operational clinic, working latrines and safe drinking water - ensuring a new generation of educated, healthy and skillful Islanders who are able to adapt to the constantly changing world.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p></p>
<p>Currently, there are no health-care facilities at the
Northern end of the island where the Maxulane community resides. In an area
where malaria, contagious skin diseases and infections are common, the close
proximity to which the local community members live to one another in their
village results in these illnesses being easily spread.  Community members in need of medical
assistance have to travel to the mainland by motorised dhow (local
wooden boats), a trip that can take anything from 3 to 8 hours, weather
depending. </p>
<p>The Tilizinwe Bazaruto community project's number one priority at this time is to get a fully functioning and staffed clinic for the community.  Through a successful auction held during
the annual Marlin fishing competition at Pestana Bazaruto Lodge in 2013, Tilizinwe Bazaruto raised enough money to renovate the designated
building into a usable clinic: with 2 wards, 2 bathrooms, a medical dispensary and
a waiting area, but we need additional funding to purchase solar power and
water reticulation systems.</p>

</div></div>","TILIZINWE means 'We are together!' in Xitswa, one of the local languages on Bazaruto Island, Mozambique. TOGETHER, we hope to uplift the local Maxulane community of Bazaruto through education and skills-development.
WHY? Because we believe that education empowers - it enables people to make informed decisions about themselves, their environment, and their world. 
We believe that, given the knowledge and skills to do so, the local population on Bazaruto island can not only thrive as people and as a community, but also contribute to the conservation of their incredible paradise.


We foresee a time, not far in the future, where we will not only have a fully functional child-care and adult skills development centre which is operated by and for the local community, but also an operational clinic, working latrines and safe drinking water - ensuring a new generation of educated, healthy and skillful Islanders who are able to adapt to the constantly changing world.
   What We Need 
Currently, there are no health-care facilities at the
Northern end of the island where the Maxulane community resides. In an area
where malaria, contagious skin diseases and infections are common, the close
proximity to which the local community members live to one another in their
village results in these illnesses being easily spread.  Community members in need of medical
assistance have to travel to the mainland by motorised dhow (local
wooden boats), a trip that can take anything from 3 to 8 hours, weather
depending. 
The Tilizinwe Bazaruto community project's number one priority at this time is to get a fully functioning and staffed clinic for the community.  Through a successful auction held during
the annual Marlin fishing competition at Pestana Bazaruto Lodge in 2013, Tilizinwe Bazaruto raised enough money to renovate the designated
building into a usable clinic: with 2 wards, 2 bathrooms, a medical dispensary and
a waiting area, but we need additional funding to purchase solar power and
water reticulation systems.



       
 The USD 10 000 we hope to raise will be used for:
- A '4 solar panel + 4 battery' kit  
- 
Water tank and tower    
- 
2 x submersible water pumps  
- 
Pump controller 
- Solar fridge for medicine that needs to be stored below room temperature
- Gas stove for boiling water 
- Gas bottles
- Employment of a local staff member who will be in charge of cleaning and maintaining the clinic
A generous donor from South Africa has donated the hospital
beds and bedside cupboards, which are currently in transit to the island. Once the clinic is complete, the Mozambiquen Department of Health has committed to sending a medical technician to permanently reside on the island and staff the clinic.



Our gratitude
As a thank you, you will receive perks such as electronic pictures of our healthy and smiling Tilizinwe kids, signed local artwork, free tours around our village when you visit us, complimentary spa treatments when at Pestana Bazaruto Lodge, or your name on a plaque in the clinic!

<p><b>MILLIONS LACK SAFE WATER IN GHANA, AFRICA</b></p>
<p>The glaring reality is we as humans on planet Earth must
drink clean water to survive – the human body depends on it. Yet, more than a
billion people across the globe don’t have access to safe, clean drinking
water. They are forced to collect water from
unsafe sources, such as rainfalls, ponds, streams and rivers that are
contaminated. </p>
<p>In Ghana, West-Africa,
drinking unsafe water is the leading cause of death in children in rural
communities before age three. In fact, a child dies every 20 seconds from
drinking unsafe water in Ghana. Unsafe water sources breed water-bourne
diseases, ill health, and oftentimes, pemature death. </p>
<p>Safe drinking water is indispensable
to life and it has been mandated by the United Nations as a human right.   

</p>
<p></p>
<p>RWA International’s mission is to save the lives of children
and rural communities by purifying polluted water sources with proven clean
water technology, thereby eliminating diseases and ill health.</p>
<p>RWA International has collected some heart-wrenching
statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 3,000 children under
     5 years of age die annually from polluted water and poor sanitation in
     Ghana.</li>
<li>3.5 million people in
     Ghana lack access to an improved water sources.</li>
<li>Over 9 million people
     don’t have access to safe drinking water.</li>
<li>80% of all diseases in
     most parts of Africa are caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation.</li>
<li>The lack of safe water in Ghana results in an economic burden to the
     country.<span>  </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ghana is largely rural and
does not have the capacity to provide safe water from large municipal treatment
plants to serve its populace. High
costs, hard-to-reach locations and power requirements are barriers to providing
solutions to the problem. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>A COST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTION EXISTS!</b></p>
<p>RWA International has studied extensive
testing and research to analyze the best water purification systems and
technologies that are available to the entire world, and concluded that the Triad
Global Water Purification System is without any doubt the best cost-effective, patented
technology available to respond to the specific challenges facing Ghana.
The system is manufactured in Atlanta, Georgia USA with subsidiaries in Nigeria
and South Sudan, Africa. </p>
<p><b>Features of the Triad Global
Water Purification System</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Uses patented medical
     technology. Thousands of tiny, hollow fibers filter out contaminates and
     produce clean pure water. </li>
<li>Membrane pore is .04
     microns that traps bacteria, viruses, protozoa, cysts, parasites, and
     eliminates turbidity to yield safe clean water that meets World Health
     Organization (WHO) standards.</li>
<li>Manually operated.
     Produces clean water immediately after set up.</li>
<li>Requires no electricity,
     no chemicals, lightweight, portable, easy to maintain.</li>
<li>No sophisticated
     monitoring required, and no special skills required to operate the unit. </li>
<li>System treats 1,000 liters
     of water per hour and 10,000 liters per day. </li>
<li>Can be set up as a bank of
     units for high volume water requirements. </li>
<li>Expected lifetime 10 years
     service per unit. </li>
</ul>

<p>RWA
International plans to establish 50 water purification units within the next 24
months in 50 selected rural communities. And, over the next 10 years, to

<li>A concrete block enclosure
     with Iron Gate to house and protect the unit.</li>
<li>Transportation and per

</ul>
<p>RWA International will engage the local
Chiefs /Community leaders who select the location for each installation, ensuring
that raw water is available at that location (e.g. well water, river, lake,

I wanted to become a special education teacher so that I could help kids with learning differences to have a better school experience than I had when I was growing up.</p>
<p>But when I started working in schools, I became frustrated with the way that kids who learned differently were treated. Even in early childhood and kindergarten classrooms, children are expected to spend a lot of time sitting down and being quiet. With large numbers of children, and increasingly strict academic expectations, early childhood teachers often spend a large portion of their time teaching children to be quiet and compliant, rather than actually helping children to discover the world around them. This is a poor way to set the foundation for a lifetime of learning!</p>
<p>I decided to start a preschool program in which children are allowed to learn in their own unique ways. This program is geared towards children who may not meet the requirements for early intervention services, but who have had, or would most likely have, negative experiences in traditional preschool programs. However, all children, with or without special needs, are welcome. Instead of subscribing to a specific learning model, we'll remain flexible, so that we can meet the individual needs of each child. </p>
<p>We have additional programs to meet the needs of the community, as well. For instance, our open play hours provide an accepting, sensory-rich environment for children with and without special needs to have fun and learn social skills. Our monthly respite days give parents and caregivers a much-needed break, and offer extra enrichment to the children. Our family nights create a feeling of community for parents and children alike. </p>
<p>In the future, I hope to add tutoring and special interest clubs for older children, and possibly add a full-time primary school classroom. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>My Goals For The Children I'll Work With</b></p>

<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">They'll develop their curiosity and a strong desire to learn more, even when not being required to by a teacher. </span><br/>

</div></div>","Summary My name is Nicki, and I am an adult with Aspergers Syndrome and ADHD. I wanted to become a special education teacher so that I could help kids with learning differences to have a better school experience than I had when I was growing up.
But when I started working in schools, I became frustrated with the way that kids who learned differently were treated. Even in early childhood and kindergarten classrooms, children are expected to spend a lot of time sitting down and being quiet. With large numbers of children, and increasingly strict academic expectations, early childhood teachers often spend a large portion of their time teaching children to be quiet and compliant, rather than actually helping children to discover the world around them. This is a poor way to set the foundation for a lifetime of learning!
I decided to start a preschool program in which children are allowed to learn in their own unique ways. This program is geared towards children who may not meet the requirements for early intervention services, but who have had, or would most likely have, negative experiences in traditional preschool programs. However, all children, with or without special needs, are welcome. Instead of subscribing to a specific learning model, we'll remain flexible, so that we can meet the individual needs of each child. 
We have additional programs to meet the needs of the community, as well. For instance, our open play hours provide an accepting, sensory-rich environment for children with and without special needs to have fun and learn social skills. Our monthly respite days give parents and caregivers a much-needed break, and offer extra enrichment to the children. Our family nights create a feeling of community for parents and children alike. 
In the future, I hope to add tutoring and special interest clubs for older children, and possibly add a full-time primary school classroom. 

My Goals For The Children I'll Work With



They'll develop their curiosity and a strong desire to learn more, even when not being required to by a teacher. 


They'll develop a love of literature.


They'll understand their own strengths, and the ways that they learn best.


They'll be accepting, and appreciative, of differences in themselves and others. 


They'll feel a sense of belonging and responsibility, in their community, and in the world. 


   What We Need  I have a business plan, a timeline, and funds to purchase equipment and supplies for the classroom. I intend to rent a space and begin setting it up in June, open for drop-in hours by late July, and have the first preschool program start in the beginning of September. 
What I am asking for from supporters is funding for the first two to three months rent in a retail space. In the Portland area, according to my research, the most affordable space would be somewhere between $1500 and $2500. These funds would give me a head start, enabling me to get the program set up and ready before I open it up to the public.

<br/><h3>
</h3>
<p>So here's my story. I am a 24-year young lady with a heart as
big as this world for animals, especially horses. It's something about their
smell, their presence, the way they move. Their eyes, those eyes you can look
into and it makes the entire world disappear and every problem you ever had is
no longer a problem; you quickly lose yourself to a massive animal staring back
at you, trusting you to take care of it and treat it like the angels they are.
I encourage you to go find a horse if you are having a bad day and sit
patiently in a chair for 15 minutes and watch them. You won’t believe how fast
your day turns around. </p>
<p>I grew up working with horses and many other animals; playing
with them throughout my childhood grew into saving misfits, training them
alongside my own, and finding better homes for the ones I couldn’t afford to
keep. My skill grew and I even attended college for several years hoping I
would become a vet- I wanted to save every animal that I could get my hands on.
After experiencing the death of some of the animals I just couldn’t save I
decided I was not cut out to be a veterinarian. Circumstances discontinued my
college pursuit, but my love for animals and desire to improve both their
quality of life and the lives of those who own them has only grown.</p>
<p>Horses are extremely
therapeutic animals, and have been proven to decrease blood pressure, lower
heart rate, relieve stress, tension, and anxiety, which has a lot to do with
why using horses for therapy is becoming more and more common. Not to mention,
caring for them has direct health benefits by burning calories. For an average
size person just grooming a horse can burn up to 422 calories/hour, and
moderate exercise while riding a horse can burn up to 457 calories/hour! The
more I learn about them, and the more I grow with them, the more driven I am to
share all the gifts these amazing creatures hold for us. </p>
<p>Finally, after being out of school for two years, I decided to
take the leap. I am fighting off debt for college loans, but I can’t wait any
longer, so I decided to start my own business! </p>
<p>“Angels Among Us” is an equine boarding facility where I also
train and teach lessons. It's a place that unwanted horses can come and receive
training and be given a second chance at life. I am also going to be hosting
pony parties so that every kid has the opportunity on their birthday to make
their dreams come true and can share it with their friends! Facilities include
two arenas, one indoor and one outdoors, each available to rent. The arenas
provide the perfect place to host clinics, shows, and any other horse related
activities. It's in a perfect location right in the middle of town, very
convenient for kids and adults to come by after school or work. This business
is meant to help not only horses, but people! Help get away from all the stress
and anxiety of the everyday life, and at the same time you will be returning the
favor for our horses. When I am able to afford it, I would also like to
purchase all the equipment and all the necessary things I need to do therapy by
building a barn that is able to properly and safely help disabled people and
people with mental illnesses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am not able to get any sort of loan or
financial help because of loans that I took out for school. I have always been
too independent to ask for money, but I have to make a choice either lose a
dream or swallow my pride and ask for help. Well I'm sure you know which one I
picked. So here I am asking you to donate, which will help me to not only start
“Angels Among Us,” but it will help me help others, horses and people alike. Once
it gets up and going it will be self-sustaining business, it's just getting
started that I need a little help with. </p>
<p>No one likes asking for money, or help in general. But we all
need it sometimes! I know that I was given a gift with these animals, and I am
determined to see it through to help as many horses and people as possible.
Training is the difference between a $250 horse and a $5,000 horse. Training is
the difference between a dangerous 1200-pound beast and a cooperative animal
willing to do as you ask. Training is the difference between a horse going to
slaughter and a horse that is happy and living a high quality of life, and able
to serve others. </p>
<p>I have the perfect facility, experience, and education to be
that difference. I take in unwanted, neglected, or abused horses and give them
the proper training to set them up for success with someone that will love them
and treat them the way they are meant to be treated. It is also perfect for
educating people on how to properly care for, ride, and teach their horses so
that they can share the same great benefits safely. But I need your help.</p>

<p><b>What do I intend to do and how?</b></p>
<p>I want to install a research unit that will develop different
rearing methods for the cricket specie <i>Brachytrupes membranaceus</i> in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, in order to farm it
commercially for direct human consumption in Kinshasa and possibly beyond. Crickets are a popular dish in the DRC. <i>Brachytrupes membranaceus </i>is a cricket specie found in more than 10
countries in the central and southern African region. The research will be conducted
through a research plan crafted with the entomologist Marianne Shockley PhD, of the
University of Georgia’s (UGA) Department of Entomology. The project will be implemented by a team of students and researchers from Institut Superieur Agroveterinaire
de Kimwenza (ISAV), the leading research institute in agribusiness in Kinshasa,
and UGA. The whole process is benefiting assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) office in
Kinshasa, as a facilitator.</p>
<p>The research will last 2 years (December 2015 – December 2017).
I will use its results to farm the cricket intensively and commercialize it in
the city of Kinshasa.</p>
<p><b>Why is this project important?</b></p>
<p>Crickets are a sustainable and healthy source of protein,
consumed by 70% of Kinshasa’s inhabitants. They are currently collected by
hand, which causes their exorbitant price. My project aims to make them affordable through a profitable venture. </p>
<p>Compared to traditional sources of protein, crickets are much
more efficient and eco-friendly. Only 2kg of feed must be given to crickets to
obtain 1kg of protein. This is a much better ratio than cattle (10kg of feed
for 1kg of protein); sheep (6kg of feed for 1kg of protein); or pigs (4kg of
feed for 1 kg of protein). Also, crickets emit considerably fewer greenhouse
gases (livestock rearing is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions),
do not require as much land, and can be fed with organic waste streams. Furthermore,
they only demand 8 liters of water to produce 1 kg of protein, against 8000 liters
for 1 kg for cattle and 1200 liters for 1 kg for chicken. </p><p>One of the goals of the research is to find the best combination of feed from the Congolese biomass to insure a production that is natural, of high quality and more competitive compared to other animal proteins.<br/></p>
<p>
 
 

 
 
Crickets are consumed
by 70% of Kinshasa’s 10 million inhabitants, and by two-thirds of the DRC’s 70
million inhabitants. The only way it has been provided is by having gatherers
individually collect the crickets. This results in a very limited supply that is
sold at a costly retail price – between $25 and $50 per kilo depending on
the season (below is a photograph of President Chirac visiting a market in Kinshasa). It’s a lot more expensive, compared to the retail price of the common
house cricket (<i>Acheta Domesticus)</i> in
the USA ($10 to $15), and in Thailand ($18 to $21). </p><p></p><p>                                       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442275932/bdv4py6wmc7gsxpwtwaf.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 294.278px; height: 196px;""/></p><br/>
<p>Rearing the cricket can also limit the environmental damages
caused by cricket gathering, since gatherers destroy the surrounding environment (plants, branches, etc.) that may hinder their search, when digging to find crickets. It will also prevent the species extinction.</p>
<p>Finally, rearing the cricket can be a mean to reduce poverty. If crickets are reared
intensively, its current gatherers will start supplying farmers with plants to
feed the crickets. This will enable them to obtain a stable income, which is
better than the limited, sporadic income they get from crickets that are painstakingly
harvested by hand, and only available during nine months out of twelve. With a
year-long supply of crickets in the market, each reseller in the chain (whom
are mostly women) will benefit from a constant income, compared to the current
state of uncertainty caused by cricket gathering. Insect rearing will also be
promoted in the DRC.</p>
<p><b>How am I going to do the research?</b></p>
<p>
 
 
The research unit

<p><b>Qui suis-je ?</b><br/></p><p>Mon nom est Michael Kazadi, je suis étudiant en deuxième année de gestion
(Administration des affaires) à l'Université Oglethorpe à Atlanta aux USA. J’ai
19 ans, je suis américain de naissance, Congolais par mes parents et j’ai vécu
dans 8 pays différents, dont la France, 5 pays d’Afrique et l’Allemagne. J’ai
également visité plus de 27 pays sur 4 continents. </p>
<p>En tant que jeune entrepreneur
vivant dans une période critique de l’histoire de l’humanité en ce qui concerne
la malnutrition, l’ambition d’émergence de l'Afrique, les défis
environnementaux de la planète et la mondialisation ; l’élevage du grillon
congolais a rapidement capté mon intérêt. Il s'agit d'un projet qui se fera en
Afrique, avec l'expertise de l'Ouest,  et
dont l’impact peut rayonner au-delà de ses frontières.</p>
<p><b>Ce que je veux faire et comment
je veux le faire ? </b></p>
<p>Je veux installer à Kinshasa, en RDC, une unité de recherche qui permettra
d'élaborer des méthodes d'élevage intensif pour l’espèce de grillon appelée <i>Brachytrupes membranaceus</i>, afin de le commercialiser pour le marché de la
consommation humaine à Kinshasa et éventuellement au delà. Le grillon est un
met populaire en RDC. Le <i>Brachytrupes membranaceus </i>est une espèce de
grillon que l’on trouve dans plus de 10 pays en Afrique centrale et australe. La
recherche sera effectuée à travers un plan de recherche que j’ai conçu avec
l'entomologiste Marianne Shockley du Département d’entomologie de l'Université
de Georgie (UGA). Son exécution sera assurée sous ma supervision, par une
équipe d'étudiants et de chercheurs de UGA et de l'Institut Supérieur
Agrovétérinaire de Kimwenza (ISAV), un des principaux instituts universitaires de recherche
dans le domaine agro-industriel à Kinshasa. L’ensemble du processus
bénéficie  également de l’assistance du
bureau de l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'Agriculture et l'Alimentation (FAO) à Kinshasa, dans un rôle de facilitateur. </p>
<p>La recherche durera 2 ans (décembre 2015 – décembre 2017), et je vais
utiliser ses résultats pour démarrer une production intensive du grillon afin
de le commercialiser dans la ville de Kinshasa.</p>
<p><b>Pourquoi le projet est-il
pertinent ?</b></p>
<p>Les grillons sont une source de
protéines durable et nutritive, et ils sont consommés par 70 % des 10 millions d'habitants de Kinshasa. Jusqu’à ce jour, ils ne sont issus que de la collecte
manuelle, ce qui explique leur prix exorbitant. Mon projet contribuera à rendre
le grillon plus accessible, à travers une entreprise rentable. </p>
<p>Par rapport aux sources traditionnelles de protéine, le grillon est
beaucoup plus efficient et respectueux de l'environnement. Il faut seulement
2 kg d'aliments pour obtenir 1 kg de protéines de grillons. Il s'agit d'un ratio
beaucoup plus intéressant que pour les bovins (10 kg d'aliments pour 1 kg de
protéines) ; le mouton, (6 kg d'aliments pour 1 kg de protéines) ; ou le porc (4
kg d'aliments pour 1 kg de protéines). Par ailleurs, les grillons émettent
infiniment moins de  gaz à effet de serre
que le bétail (le bétail contribue pour 18 % dans les émissions de gaz  à effet de serre), leur élevage nécessite peu
de terre et peut recourir aux déchets organiques courants comme aliments. En
outre, 1 litre d’eau seulement suffit pour produire 1 kg de protéines de
grillon, contre 8000 litres pour 1 kg de bœuf et 1200 litres pour 1 kg de
poulet. </p>
<p>
 
 

 
 
Le grillon est consommé par 70 % de la population de Kinshasa, qui s’élève
à environ 10 millions d’habitants, et par les 2/3 des 70 millions de Congolais.
L’approvisionnement en grillons est exclusivement assuré par la cueillette
individuelle, ce qui explique les faibles quantités disponibles et le prix
élevé au détail (entre 25 $ et 50 $ le kilo selon la saison). C’est beaucoup
trop cher comparé au prix de revente au kilo du grillon domestique produit aux
USA (10 $ à 15 $) ou en Thaïlande (18 $ à 21 $). Ci-dessous est une photo du président Chirac en train de visiter un marché à Kinshasa: </p><p></p><p>                                       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442276335/iek03ylm7fk6sapbujnw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 289.5px; height: 193px;""/></p>
<p>L’un des enjeux de la recherche
est de trouver la meilleure combinaison d’aliments issus de la biomasse
congolaise pour assurer une production naturelle, de haute qualité et plus
compétitive par rapport aux autres protéines animales.</p>
<p>L’élevage du grillon peut aussi contribuer à limiter les dommages
environnementaux causés par sa collecte sauvage. Motivés par les revenus qu’il
procure, les collecteurs de grillon n’hésitent pas à détruire les différents
obstacles à sa capture (plantes, branches, etc.) et creusent parfois en profondeur
pour en trouver, au risque d’aggraver la détérioration des sols et même de
menacer la survie de l’espèce.
</p>
<p>Enfin, l'élevage du grillon peut contribuer efficacement à la réduction de
la pauvreté. Avec l’élevage intensif du grillon, les personnes qui actuellement
le collectent artisanalement pourront devenir des fournisseurs d’aliments pour
les éleveurs de grillons et s’assurer ainsi des revenus stables et prévisibles.
Ceci est préférable aux maigres revenus issus de la cueillette pénible et
aléatoire du grillon. Avec l’élevage, la chaîne de valeur sera étendue aux
revendeurs, dont la majorité sont des femmes, qui s’assureront également des
revenus stables. Enfin, l’élevage du grillon se verra progressivement promu au
sein des populations en RDC.  </p>

</div></div>","Cliquez ici pour lire en francais !Who am I?My name is Michael Kazadi, I’m a second year student studying Business Administration at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, Georgia. I'm 19 years old, American by birth and of Congolese heritage. I’ve lived in eight different countries including France, five African nations and Germany. I have also visited over 27 countries on four continents.As a young entrepreneur, I’m concerned with issues related to malnutrition, Africa’s growth, global environmental challenges and globalization. The potentials in rearing Congolese crickets quickly became a project that captured my attention. Implementing this project in Africa and taking expertise from the West would impact regions in Africa beyond borders.
What do I intend to do and how?
I want to install a research unit that will develop different
rearing methods for the cricket specie Brachytrupes membranaceus in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, in order to farm it
commercially for direct human consumption in Kinshasa and possibly beyond. Crickets are a popular dish in the DRC. Brachytrupes membranaceus is a cricket specie found in more than 10
countries in the central and southern African region. The research will be conducted
through a research plan crafted with the entomologist Marianne Shockley PhD, of the
University of Georgia’s (UGA) Department of Entomology. The project will be implemented by a team of students and researchers from Institut Superieur Agroveterinaire
de Kimwenza (ISAV), the leading research institute in agribusiness in Kinshasa,
and UGA. The whole process is benefiting assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) office in
Kinshasa, as a facilitator.
The research will last 2 years (December 2015 – December 2017).
I will use its results to farm the cricket intensively and commercialize it in
the city of Kinshasa.
Why is this project important?
Crickets are a sustainable and healthy source of protein,
consumed by 70% of Kinshasa’s inhabitants. They are currently collected by
hand, which causes their exorbitant price. My project aims to make them affordable through a profitable venture. 
Compared to traditional sources of protein, crickets are much
more efficient and eco-friendly. Only 2kg of feed must be given to crickets to
obtain 1kg of protein. This is a much better ratio than cattle (10kg of feed
for 1kg of protein); sheep (6kg of feed for 1kg of protein); or pigs (4kg of
feed for 1 kg of protein). Also, crickets emit considerably fewer greenhouse
gases (livestock rearing is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions),
do not require as much land, and can be fed with organic waste streams. Furthermore,
they only demand 8 liters of water to produce 1 kg of protein, against 8000 liters
for 1 kg for cattle and 1200 liters for 1 kg for chicken. One of the goals of the research is to find the best combination of feed from the Congolese biomass to insure a production that is natural, of high quality and more competitive compared to other animal proteins.

 
 

 
 
Crickets are consumed
by 70% of Kinshasa’s 10 million inhabitants, and by two-thirds of the DRC’s 70
million inhabitants. The only way it has been provided is by having gatherers
individually collect the crickets. This results in a very limited supply that is
sold at a costly retail price – between $25 and $50 per kilo depending on
the season (below is a photograph of President Chirac visiting a market in Kinshasa). It’s a lot more expensive, compared to the retail price of the common
house cricket (Acheta Domesticus) in
the USA ($10 to $15), and in Thailand ($18 to $21).                                        
Rearing the cricket can also limit the environmental damages
caused by cricket gathering, since gatherers destroy the surrounding environment (plants, branches, etc.) that may hinder their search, when digging to find crickets. It will also prevent the species extinction.
Finally, rearing the cricket can be a mean to reduce poverty. If crickets are reared
intensively, its current gatherers will start supplying farmers with plants to
feed the crickets. This will enable them to obtain a stable income, which is
better than the limited, sporadic income they get from crickets that are painstakingly
harvested by hand, and only available during nine months out of twelve. With a
year-long supply of crickets in the market, each reseller in the chain (whom
are mostly women) will benefit from a constant income, compared to the current
state of uncertainty caused by cricket gathering. Insect rearing will also be
promoted in the DRC.
How am I going to do the research?

 
 
The research unit
will be based at ISAV, and conducted under my leadership by a team of students
and researchers from UGA and ISAV (below is a photograph of myself visiting a
laboratory at ISAV with its Director Mr. Ntangu, in June 2015).They will follow the research plan referred to above.

will enable both parties to share their cultures and know-how in a supportive environment. This will combine American and Asian production practices, to
produce goods that are geared towards African consumers. I also intend to add students/scientists/organizations from France and the Netherlands to the team of researchers.
Why I need your help?
My goal is to
build a profitable business model focused on sustainability. The research unit
is the first step before scaling-up production and commercialization.
By donating
money for this research, you directly contribute to the promotion of entomophagy, sustainability,
innovation, youth economic empowerment and African development. 
The campaign’s goal is to raise $38,000 to fund the following activities: 
1. 
Equipment and material for the research.
2.

3. 
Traveling costs to inspect the research.

sur mon réseau personnel de contacts et sur mon expérience sociale de la
population kinoise.
Pour le suivi du projet, un comité consultatif est en cours de constitution avec des représentants de la communauté d’entomologie des USA et de la
RDC.Je suis également conseillé par un cabinet d’avocats d’Atlanta, afin d’assurer une bonne collaboration avec les différents partenaires impliqués dans ce projet.

Que se passera-t-il après la
recherche ?
Pendant la
recherche, l’ensemble des contributeurs recevront une mise à jour régulière
sur le projet (au minimum chaque trimestre). 
Une fois que nous maîtriserons la
méthode appropriée pour l'élevage de l'espèce de grillon congolais, l'unité de
recherche se transformera automatiquement en une unité de production et de
commercialisation, à travers une filiale locale de Tropicalis LLC, l’entité américaine que j’ai créée à Atlanta, GA.
La prochaine étape consistera à développer
l’affaire à l’échelle de son haut potentiel. Nous vous invitons à soutenir la réalisation de ce projet passionnant.

Agree­ing with Edmund Burke “all that is nec­es­sary for the tri­umph of evil is that good men do noth­ing,” A Few Good Men chal­lenges cit­i­zens to embrace their respon­si­bil­ity to serve and pro­tect the defense­less. In response to Jesus Christ’s entreaty to “love the Lord your God…and love your neigh­bor as your­self,” A Few Good Men seeks to equip ser­vant lead­ers to plead the cause of the afflicted and needy, break down walls of iso­la­tion, and affirm the intrin­sic worth of human life by serv­ing those who can give noth­ing in return. Part­ner­ing with indi­vid­u­als, churches, busi­nesses, local gov­ern­ment, and non-profit orga­ni­za­tions, A Few Good Men estab­lishes a true safety net of rela­tion­ships, fos­ter­ing com­mu­nity independence.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3>
<div>And with that said, A Few Good Men Inc. is looking for your help! As we approach the summer of 2015, we want to take AFGM to the next level.  But what does ""the next level"" mean? It means we would like to bring on our first full time staff member.  Let's break it down. </div>
<ul>
<li>The majority of more than 75 volunteers are college
students, often balancing part-time work, studying for class, and volunteering for AFGM. During the school year, about a dozen crews complete projects on a consistent basis, investing 180 hours a week to meet needs in the community. </li>
<li>However, when a large percentage of our volunteer ""workforce"" departs every May, our ability to meet needs is dramatically reduced in the summer months. </li>
<li>Hiring a full-time operations officer would benefit the vision and mission of AFGM. Our goal of $10,000.00 would allow us to provide reliable, 'round the clock service through the summer and into the coming fall months. </li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Ultimately, we'd like to see AFGM take root in other counties around Michigan to equip community members to see their own needs and meet them. This fundraising campaign is a small step to grow AFGM inside of its current community, and a big step toward growing into a new community.</span></li>

</div></div>","Who We Are As a Michigan nonprofit, A Few Good Men iden­ti­fies local needs and calls men and women to action to meet those needs. Agree­ing with Edmund Burke “all that is nec­es­sary for the tri­umph of evil is that good men do noth­ing,” A Few Good Men chal­lenges cit­i­zens to embrace their respon­si­bil­ity to serve and pro­tect the defense­less. In response to Jesus Christ’s entreaty to “love the Lord your God…and love your neigh­bor as your­self,” A Few Good Men seeks to equip ser­vant lead­ers to plead the cause of the afflicted and needy, break down walls of iso­la­tion, and affirm the intrin­sic worth of human life by serv­ing those who can give noth­ing in return. Part­ner­ing with indi­vid­u­als, churches, busi­nesses, local gov­ern­ment, and non-profit orga­ni­za­tions, A Few Good Men estab­lishes a true safety net of rela­tion­ships, fos­ter­ing com­mu­nity independence.   What We Need 
And with that said, A Few Good Men Inc. is looking for your help! As we approach the summer of 2015, we want to take AFGM to the next level.  But what does ""the next level"" mean? It means we would like to bring on our first full time staff member.  Let's break it down. 

The majority of more than 75 volunteers are college
students, often balancing part-time work, studying for class, and volunteering for AFGM. During the school year, about a dozen crews complete projects on a consistent basis, investing 180 hours a week to meet needs in the community. 
However, when a large percentage of our volunteer ""workforce"" departs every May, our ability to meet needs is dramatically reduced in the summer months. 
Hiring a full-time operations officer would benefit the vision and mission of AFGM. Our goal of $10,000.00 would allow us to provide reliable, 'round the clock service through the summer and into the coming fall months. 
Ultimately, we'd like to see AFGM take root in other counties around Michigan to equip community members to see their own needs and meet them. This fundraising campaign is a small step to grow AFGM inside of its current community, and a big step toward growing into a new community.
With the success of this fundraising campaign, the leadership of our first full-time staff member, and the guidance of our board of directors, we will be more fully equipped to create exponentially greater impact on the lives of those in need. We look forward to this opportunity with great eagerness.    The Impact

<div></div>
<p>We’re Scott and Felicia Holtz, serial entrepreneurs and lovers of Skokie, Illinois. We are on a quest to bring yoga to our hometown and the surrounding area by opening North Branch Yoga. This is an independent yoga studio located in beautiful downtown Skokie which will provide classes for men, women and children of all ages and abilities.</p>
<p>Our love for Skokie is at the heart of this project and our mission is to improve the overall well-being of our community through yoga. Skokie is a unique place made up of a diverse group of citizens. Over the last decade we have proudly been a part of a renaissance in the downtown area. We have worked hand-in-hand with fellow business owners, Village leaders and community members for many community efforts. The opening of North Branch Yoga will add to the lively atmosphere of our village.</p>
<p>We are connected to our community. Scott is the vice-president for the Downtown Skokie Merchants Group (I.M.O.D.S.) and a long-time board member of the Chamber of Commerce. He is also the creator and producer of Wednesdays on the Green and lead designer at the website development firm, The Holtz Group – 5207 Inc. Felicia is a local school board member and the assistant director at a massage clinic on the North Shore. She is also certified to teach children’s yoga. Scott and Felicia have a son  who is a Boy Scout and student at Lincoln Junior High School.</p>
<p>The idea for North Branch Yoga was born last fall when we organized yoga classes during our Farmer’s Market. Attendance was outstanding with more than 45 fellow yogis joining the event and demonstrated a need and love in our community for yoga. We then started a month long Sunday morning series of classes at Skokie Theatre. The seed was now planted for North Branch Yoga and a permanent home for yoga in our community is now becoming a reality.</p>

<h3>Join <a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Squrry</a> and help make Toronto the friendliest city in Canada!</h3>
<p>Ask any foreigner who has met a Canadian abroad and they’ll tell you, Canadians are some of the friendliest people on the planet. But ask any Canadian about a Torontonian and you’ll get an entirely different answer. Come on, you know it’s true.</p>
<p>Whether we deserve it or not, we all know Toronto gets a bad rap amongst Canadians. We are seen as financially focused, concrete loving, high-rise dwelling, smart phone addicts, who really aren’t connected to the rest of Canada, let alone our very own neighbours. But those of us who proudly call the city home, know Toronto is, and can be, so much more than that.  </p>
<p>At <a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Squrry</a> we have a big dream. We want to make Toronto - a city known more for it’s tall buildings, great lakes, and stock exchanges, than it’s warm, welcoming, people - the friendliest place in Canada. Sound like a lofty goal? You bet it is. That’s why we launched the <b>Campaign for Real Friends</b>. Because we can’t do it alone.</p>
<p>With your help, we can create more community, and more real friendships, by using <a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Squrry</a>’s platform to introduce, foster, and build connections amongst like-minded Torontonians. Today, while there’s dating sites aplenty, and meeting sites that will leave you with many business cards but not many true friends, no single website is focused on building real friendships – the offline, old fashioned kind. No one until <a href=""https://squrry.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Squrry</a>.</p>
<p>At <a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Squrry</a>, we use our technology to facilitate <i>in-person</i> connections with people we know you’ll have something in common with, at places and times that suit you best, for meetings in smaller, intimate groups (or Squrries as we like to call them). We are truly committed to helping you find real, lasting friendships in this city because ""Facebookships,"" quite frankly, are falling a little short.</p>
<h3>So...how can you help?</h3>
<p>Currently, <a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Squrry</a> is being solely funded by our two co-founders, but our dreams of a friendlier Toronto are much bigger than our RRSPs. So rather than go to investors, we wanted to first go to the very people for whom we want to grow and enhance our service. <a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Squrry</a> is a site built for Torontonians, and we hope, by Torontonians.</p>
<p>For every dollar you contribute, not only can you feel good about your contribution to make Toronto a friendlier place, but also, you can win a chance at a ticket to <a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Squrry</a>’s “White Squirrel” summer rooftop party, being held on Thursday, July 30th – the UN’s official International Day of Friendship. The Party will be held on the Spoke Club's downtown Toronto rooftop patio, Thursday before the long weekend. It will be an intimate affair as far as party goes. Only 80 people all dressed in white, a DJ, an open bar with cocktails and canapés, an open roof and open minds.</p>
<h3>How can you get to this party?</h3>
<p>There are 3 ways you can contribute and get a chance to attend the summer party:</p>
<p><b>1. Buy one of 5 guaranteed, 6 ticket packages in our Perk Campaign below</b></p>
<p>30 tickets will be reserved for 5, $1000 perk packages. In the event that not all tickets are sold through this perk, those tickets will then be distributed in pairs to the top contributors, starting with the largest contributions.</p>
<p><b>2. Be one of the top 10 overall contributors</b></p>
<p>Every dollar you contribute increases your chances to be one of the top 10 contributors and win 2 tickets to <a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Squrry</a>’s White Squirrel party. In the event of a tie (eg: two individuals who contribute the same amount) the person who contributed first shall receive the tickets. Each contributor will receive a “save the date” email with link to the <a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Squrry</a> campaign page and confirmation of their contribution, with an option to opt-in for campaign updates. Check <a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Squrry.com</a> regularly to see where you are in the contribution standings.</p>
<p><b>3. Win a pair of tickets by signing up for Squrries</b></p>
<p>Each time you create or attend a <a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Squrry</a> you will receive an entry into a draw for one pair of 20 tickets.</p>
<p>Final winners and top contributors will be announced on Saturday July 25 after the campaign officially closes at midnight July 24th.  Announcements will be made on <a href=""https://squrry.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Squrry.com</a>, Indiegogo, and winners will be notified by email. Please be sure to “save the date” the evening of Thursday, July 30.</p>
<h3>Other perks and incentives</h3>
<p>In addition, we are holding a little friendly competition to see which Toronto neighbourhoods are indeed the friendliest! We will track the number of <a href=""https://squrry.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Squrry</a> registrants during the campaign to see which is the most open, friendly neighbourhood in Toronto. Check <a href=""https://squrry.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Squrry.com</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Not feeling competitive but just want to contribute to a better Toronto and a better <a href=""https://squrry.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Squrry</a>? We also have limited edition, <b>Campaign for Real Friends</b> perks, for everything from buttons to bags to t-shirts, with our limited edition, ""I heart TO"" logo, specially designed for the campaign.</p>
<h3>What we will do with your donations</h3>
<p><a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Squrry</a> was launched March 1, 2015 to a lot of positive and friendly feedback. People loved the site so much they wanted to see improvements – and we wanted to see even more people using it to foster new friendships. Here’s a brief snapshot of where your money is going:</p>
<p>· Adding new, critical team members (ie: developers, designers, and community managers) </p>
<p>· Enhancing the website to add new functionality and features</p>
<p>· Development of iOS and Android Apps</p>
<p>· Local advertising and Public Relations</p>
<p>· Online, geo-targeted advertising to grow our user base</p>
<p>· Holding a summer patio party to remember!</p>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>Are you a little tight on cash but still want to help?</p>
<p>We understand that sometimes, you just can’t swing a donation but it doesn’t mean you still can’t contribute to make Toronto the friendliest city in Canada in other ways. If a donation is not in the budget you can help us by sharing this campaign with your network. Or if you are interested in helping us spread the word, we are always looking for volunteers to help us with small, outdoor campaigns. Finally, if time and money are both tight, you can always just sign up for <a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Squrry</a> and join a <a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Squrry</a> when your schedule frees up. We hope to see all of you at a <a href=""https://squrry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Squrry</a> soon! :)</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in the Campaign for Real Friends!</p>

</div></div>","Join Squrry and help make Toronto the friendliest city in Canada!
Ask any foreigner who has met a Canadian abroad and they’ll tell you, Canadians are some of the friendliest people on the planet. But ask any Canadian about a Torontonian and you’ll get an entirely different answer. Come on, you know it’s true.
Whether we deserve it or not, we all know Toronto gets a bad rap amongst Canadians. We are seen as financially focused, concrete loving, high-rise dwelling, smart phone addicts, who really aren’t connected to the rest of Canada, let alone our very own neighbours. But those of us who proudly call the city home, know Toronto is, and can be, so much more than that.  
At Squrry we have a big dream. We want to make Toronto - a city known more for it’s tall buildings, great lakes, and stock exchanges, than it’s warm, welcoming, people - the friendliest place in Canada. Sound like a lofty goal? You bet it is. That’s why we launched the Campaign for Real Friends. Because we can’t do it alone.
With your help, we can create more community, and more real friendships, by using Squrry’s platform to introduce, foster, and build connections amongst like-minded Torontonians. Today, while there’s dating sites aplenty, and meeting sites that will leave you with many business cards but not many true friends, no single website is focused on building real friendships – the offline, old fashioned kind. No one until Squrry.
At Squrry, we use our technology to facilitate in-person connections with people we know you’ll have something in common with, at places and times that suit you best, for meetings in smaller, intimate groups (or Squrries as we like to call them). We are truly committed to helping you find real, lasting friendships in this city because ""Facebookships,"" quite frankly, are falling a little short.
So...how can you help?
Currently, Squrry is being solely funded by our two co-founders, but our dreams of a friendlier Toronto are much bigger than our RRSPs. So rather than go to investors, we wanted to first go to the very people for whom we want to grow and enhance our service. Squrry is a site built for Torontonians, and we hope, by Torontonians.
For every dollar you contribute, not only can you feel good about your contribution to make Toronto a friendlier place, but also, you can win a chance at a ticket to Squrry’s “White Squirrel” summer rooftop party, being held on Thursday, July 30th – the UN’s official International Day of Friendship. The Party will be held on the Spoke Club's downtown Toronto rooftop patio, Thursday before the long weekend. It will be an intimate affair as far as party goes. Only 80 people all dressed in white, a DJ, an open bar with cocktails and canapés, an open roof and open minds.
How can you get to this party?
There are 3 ways you can contribute and get a chance to attend the summer party:
1. Buy one of 5 guaranteed, 6 ticket packages in our Perk Campaign below
30 tickets will be reserved for 5, $1000 perk packages. In the event that not all tickets are sold through this perk, those tickets will then be distributed in pairs to the top contributors, starting with the largest contributions.
2. Be one of the top 10 overall contributors
Every dollar you contribute increases your chances to be one of the top 10 contributors and win 2 tickets to Squrry’s White Squirrel party. In the event of a tie (eg: two individuals who contribute the same amount) the person who contributed first shall receive the tickets. Each contributor will receive a “save the date” email with link to the Squrry campaign page and confirmation of their contribution, with an option to opt-in for campaign updates. Check Squrry.com regularly to see where you are in the contribution standings.
3. Win a pair of tickets by signing up for Squrries
Each time you create or attend a Squrry you will receive an entry into a draw for one pair of 20 tickets.
Final winners and top contributors will be announced on Saturday July 25 after the campaign officially closes at midnight July 24th.  Announcements will be made on Squrry.com, Indiegogo, and winners will be notified by email. Please be sure to “save the date” the evening of Thursday, July 30.
Other perks and incentives
In addition, we are holding a little friendly competition to see which Toronto neighbourhoods are indeed the friendliest! We will track the number of Squrry registrants during the campaign to see which is the most open, friendly neighbourhood in Toronto. Check Squrry.com for more info.
Not feeling competitive but just want to contribute to a better Toronto and a better Squrry? We also have limited edition, Campaign for Real Friends perks, for everything from buttons to bags to t-shirts, with our limited edition, ""I heart TO"" logo, specially designed for the campaign.
What we will do with your donations
Squrry was launched March 1, 2015 to a lot of positive and friendly feedback. People loved the site so much they wanted to see improvements – and we wanted to see even more people using it to foster new friendships. Here’s a brief snapshot of where your money is going:
· Adding new, critical team members (ie: developers, designers, and community managers) 
· Enhancing the website to add new functionality and features
· Development of iOS and Android Apps
· Local advertising and Public Relations
· Online, geo-targeted advertising to grow our user base
· Holding a summer patio party to remember!
Other ways you can help
Are you a little tight on cash but still want to help?
We understand that sometimes, you just can’t swing a donation but it doesn’t mean you still can’t contribute to make Toronto the friendliest city in Canada in other ways. If a donation is not in the budget you can help us by sharing this campaign with your network. Or if you are interested in helping us spread the word, we are always looking for volunteers to help us with small, outdoor campaigns. Finally, if time and money are both tight, you can always just sign up for Squrry and join a Squrry when your schedule frees up. We hope to see all of you at a Squrry soon! :)
Thank you for your interest in the Campaign for Real Friends!

We are also looking to expand the businesses of companies targeting mainly mainstream America. The event should give us more insights into how best to create in-language messaging  aimed at the fastest-growing racial group.     
The Impact of an Asian and ASEAN Expo
 The Asian American market is a huge market, but not many companies know how to target them. This event will help you understand this largely ignored market.
The Asian American market is considered the highest-income, best-educated and fastest-growing racial group in the US with a buying power of $760B; median household income is 32% higher than US households at $55,000
Asian Americans spend 33 percent of their dollars on deals, compared to 27 percent of non-Asians. About 78 percent of Asian American say they like to shop around before making a purchase, and two-thirds say they are willing to pay more for quality
86 percent of Asian American households have some sort of savings account, compared to 76 percent of the general US population. In addition, nearly one-third of Asian Americans surveyed keep money in certificate of deposits, a rate 86 percent higher compared to 17 percent of the general US population.  The integration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2015 is expected to create a single market where goods, capital and skilled labor will be allowed to move freely across borders within 11 ASEAN countries: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam and Timor-Leste




Many FORTUNE 500 companies in automobile, banking, cable, hospitality, insurance, money transfer and telecommunications have created and benefited from its a strong presence among Indians, Fiilipinos, Chinese and Koreans in the US.




The Challenges & Opportunities For Us
We are asking for funds to get this rolling, because we aim to produce extensive studies, insights and reports on how best to capture the Asian American market. 
These studies will help us present business and job opportunities all across the Asian segments relative also to the needs of mainstream America. It will also help many companies address the Asian American market properly.

Holding a multicultural event of this magnitude is not easy. We are raising the amount stated above, partly also because of the logistical challenge for us with the different ethnicities, different cultures and different generations of Asian Americans that we will have to manage before, during and after the event. 

  Other Ways You Can Help Let us know how you want to help make this a successful event.  Share this event with your friends and family and non-Asian friends.

In
1610, the astronomer Johannes Kepler wrote, in a letter to Galileo:</p>
<p>
<br/><b>“</b><span><span><b><span><span>Let
us create vessels and sails adjusted to the heavenly ether, and there
will be plenty of people unafraid of the empty wastes. In the
meantime, we shall prepare, for the brave sky-travellers, maps of the
celestial bodies...”</span></span></b></span></span></p>
<br/><p>The colonization of Mars means getting there in less than six months. Day trips are possible with a magnetic sail. But before you can go to Mars you have to get out of the gravity well.</p><p>Going to Mars will require an impossible balancing act between minimizing the weight and figuring out how to use the least amount of fuel possible, using traditional rockets. Mars Direct proposes a system using engines similar to the Blue Origins BE-4, harvesting the fuel from the Martian environment. It could cost as much as 450 Billion dollars, given that it requires low-thrust heavy lift capability in addition to unique spacecraft designs, plus habitats. Some believe that is a low cost for access to a new world. But the reality is that it takes more time and more expense than is required to accomplish the mission. It is said that Generals always try to re-fight the last war, and aerospace engineers always try to rebuild the last successful spacecraft. The only manned spacecraft to ever reach another world was the Apollo program, incredibly successful in repeatedly reaching the Moon with no loss of life in orbit. But the success of the mission has brought a half century of trying to reinvent ""Apollo to Mars"", such as using the Shuttle's forty year old RS-25 engines for the ""new"" Orion rocket, instead of truly adopting the ""living off the land"" principle behind Mars Direct. Everyone is so focused on low thrust heavy lift being the only way to get there, that they ignore the way things go to Mars every day.</p><p><b>The Big Idea: Magnetic Sails</b><br/>We asked ourselves a simple question, could we come up with another way to get to space without using a traditional rocket? We came up with yes, we just haven’t tried it yet. The big question was how. The answer is by using the electro-magnetic fields already in the space around the Heliosphere (the Sun) or the Magnetosphere (the Earth) to power the sails, just like an electric motor. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442446836/wopz8kq6eqaw7v92lc0v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Illustration 2: The wind sail conquered the oceans, a magnetic sail conquers the skies</p><p>We will use superconducting coils to be the magnets of the motor, since they are in a steady state and don't require additional power. In experiments magnets accelerate in electromagnetic fields and that force creates the motion to propel the spacecraft. The initial energy to power the coil is only needed once to set up the magnet. In technical terms, the ionized plasma provides a JxB reaction to the magnetic field provided by the superconducting coils, causing its electromagnetic energy to be spent by traversing the field. All the rest of the energy is provided by the exterior fields that are constantly in motion like weather patterns we can follow right now.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442446998/emziet5bgyz1gqcazixs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>...and a magnet in an electric field experiences that same force<p>Illustration 3: Electrical Field encountering a Magnetic Field produces a force</p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442447167/xoql6hb52hhjfzixre3c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p>Illustration 4: Our Magnetic Sail is a Coil</p>The problem for ground based magnetic propulsion is that the field 
strength, unless there is a thunderstorm, can be measured in micro-amps,
 and provides no effective propulsion. At altitudes above 100,000 feet, 
there is a current in the atmosphere called the Birkeland Current, which
 has values up to 100,000 amps, and routinely peaks above a million amps
 (near noon and midnight). The current doesn't reach its full value 
until it reaches the bottom layer of the Ionosphere, which varies 
between night and day. At night the E layer and F layer are present, 
starting at about 290,000 feet. During the day, a D layer forms at as 
low an altitude as 180,000 feet, and the E and F layers become much 
stronger. Often during the day the F layer, which starts at about 475,00
 feet, will differentiate into F1 and F2 layers.<br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442447550/t4pqt8liaa8ad6viksx5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Illustration 5: Ionosphere Layers<p></p><p> The

The launch will see the balloon pair rise at 2,000 to 5,000 feet per minute reaching 100,000 feet in 40 to 50 minutes after launch. Shortly thereafter, the large balloon will reach “crush depth” (or ""burst altitude"") and explode. If the coil does not have sufficient current it will fall back to the ground. If the balloon is not “steered” sufficiently to reach the sheet, it will also fall back to the ground. If the balloon doesn't have enough altitude to encounter the current, even though it is in the right spot, it will drift until reaching crush depth or loss of gas. We can compensate for this by picking the right day when we know the current will be at its maximum of a million amps, so even if we get 1000 times less, it is still a thousand amps. Our coil can produce substantial thrust even with a hundred amps.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442448683/hlsujd3fqg5k498iebzg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Illustration 11: Prototype 1 flight configuration<br/><br/><p>The second prototype corrects some of the deficiencies of the first prototype.

In place of the jet engine, we can provide a rocket engine, to get us the additional altitude to solidly place the coil inside the current. Other methods of reaching these locations at these altitudes are solely within the control of the military and government. Launching a sounding rocket, which can reach anywhere in the ionosphere, costs between 3.5M$ and 4.5M$, if NASA will let you do so. The weather balloon and rocket engine powered model airplane should be able to do almost as well for our purposes at a fraction of the price. A second advantage of this method is that moving the coil through the current increases the acceleration that the coil provides, providing another boost to the thrust generated.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442448964/sgbi3fpfwexyeqg5bqkm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Illustration 13: Lockheed F-104G ""StarFighter""<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442449211/dph9mnooqul3deyvnbl7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Illustration 14: Prototype 2 flight configuration<br/><br/><p>The Cubesat electronics will be located inside the body of the model aircraft, with the antenna following behind the plane. The DeLorme (inReach SE or equivalent) provides satellite communications, location, and altitude information throughout the mission. It sends and receives 160 character free-form text messages with GPS coordinates to emails or cell numbers anywhere in the world. It provides 100% global coverage through the Iridium satellite network, important in the remote arctic areas where these missions will take place. It provides delivery confirmation for all text messages and SOS signals. The embedded controller can take the commands received through the DeLorme and manipulate the servos of the aircraft. Two servos are especially important, the one that cuts the tie to the weather balloon, and the one that lights the solid rocket motor. The rocket motor will be launched at 45°, to escape the collapsing skin of the weather balloon, then pulled into a 90° vertical to get as much altitude as possible. Once the coil is powered by the current, the acceleration it provides will far exceed the contribution of the rocket.<br/><br/><b>Funding— Why Indiegogo and where does the money go?</b><br/>Traditional research funding is a difficult field with only a small pool to share among a large group of interested individuals all trying to get the same grant money for their projects. We wanted to try to start with Indiegogo to go for the idea of people explorers, bringing the wonder back into space exploration. This helps all projects with ideas of space being right up front, something tangible for the in the moment. This project will help our time table come down from sometime in the next few years to sometime in the next year. We would like to have our first test project launch in 2016 where our backers can follow it through the website and track its GPS live, or if they have sufficient resources, join us and experience it firsthand.</p><p>Even with some angel funding or venture funding and our own funds, it would take us years to realize this dream without your help. We want to get this technology ready and available for people before the decade is through instead of still mucking through the red tape of funding for the next five years. With help, we can get the first launch done since the first balloon is ready to be built, and we can get it into orbit to see if our theory is sound. We want to test all the components and theory in a real life trial where everyone wants see it: live, in real life, in real time. If we reach our stretch goals we can continue testing, and see how far we can go. Perhaps even as far as Mars.<br/><br/>The project funding request is for 200,000$US. Almost 75,000$US of that goes to Indiegogo perks, leaving a basic funding level of 125,000$US. About 40,500$US of that goes for constructing the prototypes, buying the balloons, model aircraft, radios, servos, GPS, embedded controller, superconducting wire, aerogel insulation, custom solid rocket motor construction, and gas to fill the balloons. 27,000$US of the funding request goes for data logging and prototype construction labor. 40,000$US of the funding request goes for consulting from the University of New Mexico, to calculate coil effects, calculate weather effects, plus exploit the brightest, least expensive resource in the Universe – graduate students.

(http://www.koat.com/news/earth-to-mars-in-less-...)UPDATE! -- Daily Lobo covers our related research! (http://www.dailylobo.com/article/2015/10/28-unm...)UPDATE! -- Space Daily covers our project! (http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Magnetic_Sail...) 

In
1610, the astronomer Johannes Kepler wrote, in a letter to Galileo:

“Let
us create vessels and sails adjusted to the heavenly ether, and there
will be plenty of people unafraid of the empty wastes. In the
meantime, we shall prepare, for the brave sky-travellers, maps of the
celestial bodies...”
The colonization of Mars means getting there in less than six months. Day trips are possible with a magnetic sail. But before you can go to Mars you have to get out of the gravity well.Going to Mars will require an impossible balancing act between minimizing the weight and figuring out how to use the least amount of fuel possible, using traditional rockets. Mars Direct proposes a system using engines similar to the Blue Origins BE-4, harvesting the fuel from the Martian environment. It could cost as much as 450 Billion dollars, given that it requires low-thrust heavy lift capability in addition to unique spacecraft designs, plus habitats. Some believe that is a low cost for access to a new world. But the reality is that it takes more time and more expense than is required to accomplish the mission. It is said that Generals always try to re-fight the last war, and aerospace engineers always try to rebuild the last successful spacecraft. The only manned spacecraft to ever reach another world was the Apollo program, incredibly successful in repeatedly reaching the Moon with no loss of life in orbit. But the success of the mission has brought a half century of trying to reinvent ""Apollo to Mars"", such as using the Shuttle's forty year old RS-25 engines for the ""new"" Orion rocket, instead of truly adopting the ""living off the land"" principle behind Mars Direct. Everyone is so focused on low thrust heavy lift being the only way to get there, that they ignore the way things go to Mars every day.The Big Idea: Magnetic SailsWe asked ourselves a simple question, could we come up with another way to get to space without using a traditional rocket? We came up with yes, we just haven’t tried it yet. The big question was how. The answer is by using the electro-magnetic fields already in the space around the Heliosphere (the Sun) or the Magnetosphere (the Earth) to power the sails, just like an electric motor. Illustration 2: The wind sail conquered the oceans, a magnetic sail conquers the skiesWe will use superconducting coils to be the magnets of the motor, since they are in a steady state and don't require additional power. In experiments magnets accelerate in electromagnetic fields and that force creates the motion to propel the spacecraft. The initial energy to power the coil is only needed once to set up the magnet. In technical terms, the ionized plasma provides a JxB reaction to the magnetic field provided by the superconducting coils, causing its electromagnetic energy to be spent by traversing the field. All the rest of the energy is provided by the exterior fields that are constantly in motion like weather patterns we can follow right now....and a magnet in an electric field experiences that same forceIllustration 3: Electrical Field encountering a Magnetic Field produces a forceIllustration 4: Our Magnetic Sail is a CoilThe problem for ground based magnetic propulsion is that the field 
strength, unless there is a thunderstorm, can be measured in micro-amps,
 and provides no effective propulsion. At altitudes above 100,000 feet, 
there is a current in the atmosphere called the Birkeland Current, which
 has values up to 100,000 amps, and routinely peaks above a million amps
 (near noon and midnight). The current doesn't reach its full value 
until it reaches the bottom layer of the Ionosphere, which varies 
between night and day. At night the E layer and F layer are present, 
starting at about 290,000 feet. During the day, a D layer forms at as 
low an altitude as 180,000 feet, and the E and F layers become much 
stronger. Often during the day the F layer, which starts at about 475,00
 feet, will differentiate into F1 and F2 layers.Illustration 5: Ionosphere Layers The 
Birkeland current is a ribbon about 285 miles wide by 1500 miles long, 
stretching from a circle around the magnetic pole (north or south), 
centered on the noon and midnight axis, one ribbon on each side of the 
globe. The ring is where we see the Aurora Borealis or Aurora Australis.Illustration 6: Magnetic Poles and the Birkeland Current SheetUnfortunately, this leaves us like the people in the alley who want to use the fire escape to get back into the building, it is too far above our heads to grab easily. Just like the fire escape, Birkeland Current Sheets go both upward and downward on each side of the building (dayside or nightside), but the nightside fire escape is another floor higher out of reach.Illustration 7: Aurora Australis from the International Space StationOne low cost craft that routinely journeys to the 25 mile altitudes and as high as 35 miles altitude is a weather balloon. So our first prototype is based around a balloon, but somewhat smaller – a chimney balloon.Illustration 8: Prototype 1, balloon with coil wrapped around itOur prototype uses aerogel tape to insulate the superconductive wire that forms the coil. To be able to reach the 35 mile altitude, the balloon may have to be filled with hydrogen. The tubes could also be filled with liquid helium, the idea being to leave the expensive (and heavy) cryocooler on the ground, with enough coolant and insulation to complete the mission. Cubesat compatible avionics, combined with a DeLorme inReach SE or equivalent, will provide continuous GPS position updates. Note that while the cubesat shown is 1U (small), there is no reason (other that weight) that it couldn't be 6U (3x2 i.e. large).Illustration 9: Prototype 1, balloon with coil wrapped around it End ViewSuch a small balloon has no hope of completing the mission by itself. Like many times in life, just as we are asking the Indiegogo community for help, we need an assist with the heavy lifting. We propose using a standard weather balloon, forty feet in diameter, to get us to the bottom of the ionosphere.Illustration 10: 40' weather balloonThis prototype assumes the coil will be able to “steer” the balloon by following the magnetic field lines, which will drive it towards the maximum field intensity – the center of the Birkeland Current Sheet. The launch will see the balloon pair rise at 2,000 to 5,000 feet per minute reaching 100,000 feet in 40 to 50 minutes after launch. Shortly thereafter, the large balloon will reach “crush depth” (or ""burst altitude"") and explode. If the coil does not have sufficient current it will fall back to the ground. If the balloon is not “steered” sufficiently to reach the sheet, it will also fall back to the ground. If the balloon doesn't have enough altitude to encounter the current, even though it is in the right spot, it will drift until reaching crush depth or loss of gas. We can compensate for this by picking the right day when we know the current will be at its maximum of a million amps, so even if we get 1000 times less, it is still a thousand amps. Our coil can produce substantial thrust even with a hundred amps.Illustration 11: Prototype 1 flight configurationThe second prototype corrects some of the deficiencies of the first prototype. It changes the model from a balloon to a spacecraft. This gives us the ability to change the shape of the magnetic fields in three dimensions, for greater stability. Standard aircraft control surfaces give us greater ability to “steer” the balloon.Our choice for the plane is the F-104G StarFighter, aptly named for our purposes. There is a possibility that if the test goes well, the craft will follow the current sheet out into the Magnetotail, and then off into the heliosphere, and then eventually out of the solar system.Illustration 12: Magnetic Sail Prototype planeThere is one other advantage the F-104G scale model gives us. In place of the jet engine, we can provide a rocket engine, to get us the additional altitude to solidly place the coil inside the current. Other methods of reaching these locations at these altitudes are solely within the control of the military and government. Launching a sounding rocket, which can reach anywhere in the ionosphere, costs between 3.5M$ and 4.5M$, if NASA will let you do so. The weather balloon and rocket engine powered model airplane should be able to do almost as well for our purposes at a fraction of the price. A second advantage of this method is that moving the coil through the current increases the acceleration that the coil provides, providing another boost to the thrust generated.Illustration 13: Lockheed F-104G ""StarFighter""Illustration 14: Prototype 2 flight configurationThe Cubesat electronics will be located inside the body of the model aircraft, with the antenna following behind the plane. The DeLorme (inReach SE or equivalent) provides satellite communications, location, and altitude information throughout the mission. It sends and receives 160 character free-form text messages with GPS coordinates to emails or cell numbers anywhere in the world. It provides 100% global coverage through the Iridium satellite network, important in the remote arctic areas where these missions will take place. It provides delivery confirmation for all text messages and SOS signals. The embedded controller can take the commands received through the DeLorme and manipulate the servos of the aircraft. Two servos are especially important, the one that cuts the tie to the weather balloon, and the one that lights the solid rocket motor. The rocket motor will be launched at 45°, to escape the collapsing skin of the weather balloon, then pulled into a 90° vertical to get as much altitude as possible. Once the coil is powered by the current, the acceleration it provides will far exceed the contribution of the rocket.Funding— Why Indiegogo and where does the money go?Traditional research funding is a difficult field with only a small pool to share among a large group of interested individuals all trying to get the same grant money for their projects. We wanted to try to start with Indiegogo to go for the idea of people explorers, bringing the wonder back into space exploration. This helps all projects with ideas of space being right up front, something tangible for the in the moment. This project will help our time table come down from sometime in the next few years to sometime in the next year. We would like to have our first test project launch in 2016 where our backers can follow it through the website and track its GPS live, or if they have sufficient resources, join us and experience it firsthand.Even with some angel funding or venture funding and our own funds, it would take us years to realize this dream without your help. We want to get this technology ready and available for people before the decade is through instead of still mucking through the red tape of funding for the next five years. With help, we can get the first launch done since the first balloon is ready to be built, and we can get it into orbit to see if our theory is sound. We want to test all the components and theory in a real life trial where everyone wants see it: live, in real life, in real time. If we reach our stretch goals we can continue testing, and see how far we can go. Perhaps even as far as Mars.The project funding request is for 200,000$US. Almost 75,000$US of that goes to Indiegogo perks, leaving a basic funding level of 125,000$US. About 40,500$US of that goes for constructing the prototypes, buying the balloons, model aircraft, radios, servos, GPS, embedded controller, superconducting wire, aerogel insulation, custom solid rocket motor construction, and gas to fill the balloons. 27,000$US of the funding request goes for data logging and prototype construction labor. 40,000$US of the funding request goes for consulting from the University of New Mexico, to calculate coil effects, calculate weather effects, plus exploit the brightest, least expensive resource in the Universe – graduate students. The remaining 1,750$US is held as a contingency for unforeseen expenses.Illustration 15: Proposed Use of Requested FundsThe first mission is to launch two prototypes from Sydney, Australia (or Hobart, Tasmania) towards Antarctica and the South Magnetic Pole. A three person crew will perform the mission, one technical representative from the University of New Mexico, and two assistants from Dark Sea Industries.The mission crew may be joined by backers who have contributed to the effort, at their own expense. Additional backers who have contributed to the effort can join the UNM and Dark Sea Industries team at mission control in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.Illustration 16: First Mission Launches two prototypesThe mission crew will have to assemble the shipped components, verify the electronics are working properly, make sure all government requirements are fulfilled, assemble the prototypes, fill the balloons with gas, launch the prototypes and monitor their progress. While the distance of 2328 miles would take many days for a normal weather balloon, the coil will provide an acceleration of up to 15,000mph (to reach orbit) and a lower acceleration of a few hundred mph after it reaches the lower border of the ionosphere. Fortunately, the Birkeland current extends 1500 miles from the pole, and the Hobart site is practically right under the edge of it. If either prototype does reach orbit, it will almost certainly exceed escape velocity as it exits the magnetotail.Illustration 17: Map of first missionIllustration 18: First Mission ProfileThe second mission is designed to be chosen between two alternatives, 
another mission to the South Magnetic Pole, using Rio De Janeiro, Brazil
 or Buenos Aires, Argentina; or a mission to the North Magnetic Pole, 
from Seattle.Rio de Janeiro is very far from the South Magnetic Pole. It is not as far from the Aurora Australis arc (roughly half the distance). It would be very useful to know if any boundary on the auroral arcs works just as well for the purposes of going to space, as indicated by the Birkeland Current Maps derived by AMPERE and the Iridium satellite network. The auroral arc roughly follows the outline of Antartica.Illustration 19: Second Mission Southern OptionThe location of Buenos Aires is several thousand miles closer to the auroral arc, making it almost as good as Sydney as a launch site. It has the disadvantage of being even further from the South Magnetic Pole itself. It also is much less convenient for people in Albuquerque than Seattle is, a disadvantage the other two sites share.Illustration 20: Second mission Rio de Janeiro MapSeattle is about 400 miles further away from the North Magnetic Pole than Sydney is from the South Magnetic Pole. The possibility of Fairbanks, Alaska, which is 700 miles closer than Seattle to the North Magnetic Pole is saved for a Stretch Goal contingency. The Fairbanks Mission 2B would use a small general aviation aircraft to tow the prototype 2 with weather balloon several hundred miles closer, to the edge of the Birkeland Current Sheet, releasing it at 10,000+ feet. This reduces the error margin for access to the current. Combined with the solid rocket motor in the F-104G model aircraft, we should be able to know exactly where in the current sheet the prototype will be placed.Illustration 21: Second Mission Northern OptionIllustration 22: Second mission Seattle MapStretch Goal IdeasIf contributions reach 350,000$US or more -We will complete all the listed missions, Sydney, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Seattle, Fairbanks.If contributions reach 800,000$US or more -We will complete all the listed missions, Sydney, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Seattle, Fairbanks. We will also use the technology to create a spacecraft to use the next Earth-Mars opposition (July 2018) to send a craft to orbit Mars in less than a week after leaving Earth.If contributions reach 1,500,000$US or more -We will complete all the listed missions, Sydney, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Seattle, Fairbanks. We will also use the technology to create a spacecraft to use the next Earth-Mars opposition (July 2018) to send a craft to orbit Mars in less than a week after leaving Earth. We will also complete the design for a spacecraft that can launch on its own from the surface of the Earth, launch to Mars, land on Mars, launch from the surface of Mars, and return to Earth, all in less than two weeks at any time of the year. We call this robotic utility craft Hannapral-R.Such spacecraft do not travel on the straight lines we see during opposition missions but instead travel on parabolic courses, towards the Sun, then away from the Sun.Illustration 23: Hannapral robotic utility craft with SharkFin embedded in skinIf contributions reach 2.5 Million $US or more -We will complete all the listed missions, Sydney, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Seattle, Fairbanks. We will also use the technology to create a spacecraft to use the next Earth-Mars opposition (July 2018) to send a craft to orbit Mars in less than a week after leaving Earth.

We call this robotic utility craft Hannapral-R.Risks and ChallengesLike any project or research, there are issues that can result from technical difficulties that we cannot foresee resulting in launch delays. These are some of the known risks that may lie ahead. We are prepared to tackle all of the foreseen and unknown challenges ahead of use and our backers hopefully will understand that we could be delayed for reasons outside of our control and that we will do everything in our power to move forward to get our project off the ground and into space. We will keep everyone updated regularly regarding our progress towards the launch and future endeavors.Illustration 24: Parabolic heliosphere course from Earth to MarsLinkshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_magnetic_fieldhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliospherehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#Magnetic_fieldhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Jupiterhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionospherehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetospherehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkeland_currenthttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_balloonhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_balloonhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_forcehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromotive_forcehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoplasmadynamic_thrusterhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounding_rocketSWAGProject StickerProject PatchMission Patches (dependent upon funding)Project Plaque",28.0,0,"1 Campaign

Finally, we need to make sure our staff
gets paid timely and our guests are happy. This means having a secure wages
reserve. This also means buying enough high-quality tea, coffee and snacks. To
ensure that for the first three months before the space gains enough clients
and begins to self-sustain, we need 450 000CZK.



In total, it's 1 100 000CZK or approximately
50 000 USD/EUR.
What's in it for YOU
We invite you to our art-space cafe where you can receive free art production items (postcards, photographs, posters etc.), and conduct your own art/ social/ educational webinars and events! 
With a little donation, YOU can help make this amazing project reality! When your contribution, you will support dreams, communities and creativity. Who knows, maybe your donation will help the next great artist or activist make an impact on the world!
Besides a great feeling, what else can you get by supporting this project?

You can become a part of our art-space cafe. Receive free passes to all our events or our art production (postcards, photographs, posters and so on). You can also conduct your art/ social/ educational webinars online or visit Prague and do it onsight! 
Maybe you are an unknown artist? We can introduce your name to both Czech and international public. You decide what works best for you - we make it happen!
What if we wouldn't reach the goal
In case we wouldn't get the full amount we will start it step by step with smaller capacity, e.g. without spending money on instruments, having less opening hours and therefore less people in the team, smaller space for the beginning and other possible solutions. We're supposing to fulfill all our perks during at least 3 months in any case. 
    Risks & Challenges
As everybody we have some main risks to manage with:
Development Risk

Problem: Lack of customers/ non-returning customers 
Solution: 
Advertisement, promotion activities;


Cooperation with related institutions such as art schools/ studios/ clubs/ other related social spacesand institutions


Conducting social services at the start to collect customer feedback andtotimely apply needed measures


Facility & Location

Problem: 
Finding a licensable building,
easily accessible by public transportation, with appropriate area and space
planning, and the corresponding use permissions. 
Probability of delays in processing and higher fees than expected. 

 Solution: 
Carry out preliminay
research, including professional consultations upon current situation and
predicted developement of the city area. 

Familiarize ourselves with the processes for attaining City permits and follow-up on our initial contacts to ensure smooth working relationships.

</p><p>Hello. We are Max
Konstanty and Josh Sommer.  We are co-authoring a riveting new book
called God and Country.   
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We met at the Purchase
Area Walk to Emmaus in September of 2014. We both come from a
Christian background. Both of us feel that the United States is in
dire need of a strong voice to re-ignite forgotten or misplaced
Conservative principals because that voice has been lost.  Therefore,
this book is being written as the catalyst to re-ignite these
principals.   
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Max was born in Florida
and his family, after moving around a bit, settled down north of
Bowling Green, Kentucky.  After graduation from Crittenden County
High School in Marion, Kentucky, Max attended Murray State University
where he obtained a Bachelors of Science degree with an emphasis on
telecommunications.  Max then moved to Charlotte, North Carolina and
attended the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  Max became
involved in the Church of Christ and is thoroughly familiar with
their teachings and traditions.    
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Halfway through obtaining
his degree, Max became concerned about the health of his father.  He
thought about dropping his classes, but his family urged him to
finish his degree.  Max obtained a Master's Degree in Information
Technology in December of 2008 and moved to Paducah, Kentucky the
next month where he had been offered a position as a risk management
analyst.  Max became interested in Conservative politics after
listening to Rush Limbaugh's Institute for Advanced Conservative
Studies.  
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Josh was born in Paducah,
Kentucky and grew up in Massac County, Illinois.  Josh attended Joppa
High School.  After graduation, Josh attended Shawnee Community
College in Ullin, Illinois where he obtained an Associates of the
Arts Degree.  Thereafter, Josh went to Murray State University, where
he graduated in December of 2003 with a Bachelors of Science Degree
in Geography.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After graduation, Josh
began working at the City of Oak Grove, Kentucky.  Josh then came
back to the City of Paducah in November of 2008 when he was offered a
planning position.  Josh was raised in a Conservative family and has
held true to those values.  Josh had grown up in the Southern Baptist
Church most of his life.  He became non-denominational in late 2008.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Max felt the call on his
life to write God and Country in 2012.  Max had written down many
ideas, including the topics for this book.  After meeting at the
Purchase Area Walk to Emmaus in September of 2014, Max and Josh had a
discussion in Calloway County, Kentucky that began the process of
this book being written.  Topics began to be compiled in October of
2014.  Max and Josh began in earnest in the Summer of 2015,
contacting a publisher and setting aside at least one day a week to
work on God and Country.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our hope is to raise
$4,350.00 in order to pay for publishing and other related expenses. 
We have decided to publish with WestBow Press, a division of Thomas
Nelson and Zondervan, which has a superb track record of publishing
Christian authors.  WestBow will assist us in getting God and Country
in stores around the World and with an online presence in retailers
such as Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble.  Our agreement with them will
account for publishing the book in both tangible and digital format. 
Together, with your help, we can begin the process of restoring
Conservatism and help guide this nation back to our Christian roots. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of us have strong
Christian backgrounds to draw from, have a deep sense of patriotism
and are deeply concerned about the direction of America.  This nation
has turned against the Lord and our moral compass has been
denigrated.  America has become a nation where anything goes, from
homosexual marriage to rampant abortion to selling baby parts to
actively prosecuting and jailing Christians.  We feel there is a
majority of Americans ready to rise up and take our country back,
both on our knees and at the ballot box.  We know that America can be
saved!  Our hope is that Americans, coast to coast and north to
south, will read God and Country and, through our common bond of
patriotism and God-instilled values, rise up as one people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, in the event we do
not reach our goal of $4,350.00, we will not be able to purchase the
package of our choice with WestBow, however; it is our intent to get
this book published.  We will then chose an alternate, less-expensive
package to get God and Country published in some format.   
</p>
<p>
</p><p>God and Country is
important to us because we see it not as just a conservative
handbook, but as a catalyst for a Christian revolution.  We hope that
God and Country becomes a household name around the World, rooted in
Christian love as Jesus himself showed.  Neither of us wish to take
credit for any positive impacts this book has, but rather give glory
to God and kudos to hard-working Americans that have so selflessly
sacrificed to help fund this book and get it off the ground.    
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This book will stand as
justification for Christian principals, however; it only stands as
opinion or argument for non-believers that will not fully understand
the claims made, as some knowledge of the word is derived only
through faith.  We believe in some basic tenants of what God and
Country is based on:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>We believe God and
	Country to be Holy Spirit guided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is intended to
	show love, mercy and compassion for people while making them aware
	how the enemy is using the powers that be to come against God the
	Father.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God and Country is
	Biblically-based and exercises a Christian world-view.  
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God and Country will
	provide a foundation and blue print to return America back to our
	moral, ethical and God-given principals.  
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do not condemn
	anyone or any group in this book, as we realize our struggle is with
	principalities and powers, not against flesh and blood.  
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are fully aware
	of our society's moral decay and intend to combat it forcefully
	through God and Country and with the power of prayer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are aware, and
	believe, this society is in the end times.  Jesus said in Revelation
	that the Saints would war against the beast.  We hope that God and
	Country serves to prepare spiritual warriors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We sincerely hope
	that salvation follows to many who read God and Country as well as
	showing them how to take a stand against the tyranny that has
	befallen us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God and Country is
	intended to empower people and educate them how to show love through
	Jesus Christ.  We hope to see an army of Christians that love people
	in word and deed and are steadfast when society tries to oppress and
	force unjust laws upon the silent majority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We know Jesus Christ
	is coming back.  Time is of the essence to publish God and Country. 
	Our hope is that all Christians will be prepared for His return.  
	</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of us have spent
countless hours in prayer for this book.  We have sought the Holy
Spirit, which has helped and qualified us, as with any Christian, to
write God and Country.  Much time has been taken to analyze and use
current events to illustrate how Americans have, by-and-large, become
pacifists that need to have a greater revelation of God and his love.
 Thereby, through that love, to be a force for good to encourage
people and show love how God loves.  We intent to use our right,
through this representative Government, to be heard.    
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main hurdle we face
is monetary, as we hope to publish in as many formats as possible in
order to reach as many people as possible.  Therefore, with your
help, we hope to overcome this hurdle.  Also, many people skeptical
of Christianity say that the Bible is polarizing which serves to
divide people.  God and Country is not meant to divide, but to unite
all people transcending race, culture, age, wealth, gender, politics
and any other spectrum of humanity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In conclusion, we
sincerely hope and ask for your help in getting this book published. 
For everyone that donates $30 or more, we will give you an honorable
mention in God and Country as an appendix!  We understand that some
people may wish to donate anonymously.  Knowing that people have
found  solace, direction and steadfastness in this book will bless us
greater than we could ever imagine.  We hope this book serves to
address both the Great Commission and the Great Commandment.  Both of
us offer sincere blessings to the reader of this plea and hope you
will consider helping us publish God and Country!</p>
<p>
</p><p>God Bless.</p>

	that the Saints would war against the beast.  We hope that God and
	Country serves to prepare spiritual warriors.


We sincerely hope
	that salvation follows to many who read God and Country as well as
	showing them how to take a stand against the tyranny that has
	befallen us.


God and Country is
	intended to empower people and educate them how to show love through
	Jesus Christ.  We hope to see an army of Christians that love people
	in word and deed and are steadfast when society tries to oppress and
	force unjust laws upon the silent majority.


We know Jesus Christ
	is coming back.  Time is of the essence to publish God and Country. 
	Our hope is that all Christians will be prepared for His return.  
	


Both of us have spent
countless hours in prayer for this book.  We have sought the Holy
Spirit, which has helped and qualified us, as with any Christian, to
write God and Country.  Much time has been taken to analyze and use
current events to illustrate how Americans have, by-and-large, become
pacifists that need to have a greater revelation of God and his love.
 Thereby, through that love, to be a force for good to encourage
people and show love how God loves.  We intent to use our right,
through this representative Government, to be heard.    


The main hurdle we face
is monetary, as we hope to publish in as many formats as possible in
order to reach as many people as possible.  Therefore, with your
help, we hope to overcome this hurdle.  Also, many people skeptical
of Christianity say that the Bible is polarizing which serves to
divide people.  God and Country is not meant to divide, but to unite
all people transcending race, culture, age, wealth, gender, politics
and any other spectrum of humanity.

In conclusion, we
sincerely hope and ask for your help in getting this book published. 
For everyone that donates $30 or more, we will give you an honorable
mention in God and Country as an appendix!  We understand that some
people may wish to donate anonymously.  Knowing that people have
found  solace, direction and steadfastness in this book will bless us
greater than we could ever imagine.  We hope this book serves to
address both the Great Commission and the Great Commandment.  Both of
us offer sincere blessings to the reader of this plea and hope you
will consider helping us publish God and Country!

<p></p> <p>My name is Jacob Mazel. I am trying to create crowd-sourced seasonal weather forecasts by turning my current website <a href=""www.raindancewx.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Raindance Weather</a> which is little more than an Indiegogo demonstration currently, into a weather prediction market. For daily forecasts, weather prediction markets are already a proven concept (<a href=""http://freakonomics.com/2007/03/22/betting-the-weather/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Weather Prediction Market</a>). My goal is develop a seasonal weather forecasting market for US cities - i.e is the winter going to be snowier than usual in Albuquerque? How about in Chicago or in your city?</p>
<p>It is my belief that over time strong opinions about the weather from amateurs would produce a very reliable seasonal weather forecast.</p>
<p>I have some evidence to back up my belief. Before Albuquerque's snow season of 2014-2015, I had my co-workers guess how much snow Albuquerque would get each month. Winners, in terms of forecasts matching observed conditions, received free pizza. With the exception of February when we had very rare heavy snow, the overall predictions were quite accurate.

<div>
<span>Contributing to this project puts you on your way to seeing how people from vastly different backgrounds think seasonal weather will play out in your backyard.

<p>More generally, by contributing to this campaign, you are helping me undergo a grand experiment that should yield some interesting results:</p> <ul> <li>Can a crowd produce an accurate seasonal weather forecast?</li> <li>Can the crowd match or beat individual expert forecasters?</li>
<li>We can answer these questions with user interest and ongoing participation.</li>
<li>Overtime, the results may become good enough to save lives and dollars.</li>
<li>There are a hand full of brilliant long range forecasters out there now - Joe Bastardi, Dave Tolleris, Joe D'Aleo - but they are aging. One of the benefits of contributing to this campaign would be to help discover the next wave of brilliant long-range forecasters.</li> </ul>
<div>One of the reasons I want web development help is to collect basic user information. We can collect and analyze this information in all sorts of ways.</div>
<div>Do men make better forecasters? How about older people? In our snow experiment, the older folks in the office won the individual months each time, but I, at the age of 27, had the closest seasonal call. <span>Do people living in the area they are forecasting predict differently than people outside the area? </span>
</div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<div>I am curious to see if studying the weather actually makes you a good forecaster. We could ask people to rate their knowledge of the weather when they sign up and then see if the people who rated themselves highly actually forecast well.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>There are many challenges to this project. One is interest. This campaign is designed not just to raise money, but to see if interest in this project exists on a large enough scale. For forecasts to be possible, users will need to continue to bet their fake currency over time, which means...we need users.</div>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I am hoping the possibility of being known as the best forecaster for something like snowfall outlooks, will keep users interested. I would like to offer some kind of prize, beyond additional fake currency for the winners, but this gets a little bit trick</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">y legally.

</div>
<div>To promote interest, I will <span>reach out to various weather forums, weather forecasters with many twitter followers, and use Fiverr favors for promotion. </span>

I've made some bold predictions in the video game industry in the past (Five year prediction) which essentially verified (Forecast Verification). 
I would like to give people not just the opportunity to prove they can predict long range weather trends well, but the wisdom of a forecast generated by the masses. 
   What We Need & What You Get Raindance Weather currently does not allow for users to register and as it stands now you can't use it for forecasting. This crowdfunding pitch is to try to raise $65,000 to develop out that functionality. For that much money I can:  Hire web development help ($20,000 - $60,000). The full $60,000 would cover tying the fake betting scheme to user accounts while $20,000 covers a much more basic site.
Provide custom tools and visualizations to analyze forecasts and forecasters. Pay for servers  Hire researchers to help with collecting data for various cities. These people would also help with forecast verification. Forecasts will be verified with NOW Data, and Weather Warehouse data for the USA. Both NOW and the Weather Warehouse archive data from the National Weather Service (NWS).
Reimburse some of my personal costs - my logo, time, web video, domain, legal research, new laptop ($600).
Advertise / convince people to participate and stay on the site.
Produce custom, big data research.

If I don't reach my goal fully, the website will become less sophisticated, but there are other approaches. One approach would be Survey Monkey. Even with less money it would be possible to buy ""survey takers"" from Survey Monkey, and then use their insights to generate forecasts.



Why Should I Contribute?


Contributing to this project puts you on your way to seeing how people from vastly different backgrounds think seasonal weather will play out in your backyard. If you think the weatherman on TV making long-range forecasts is an idiot, you also have a way to prove that you're right, or that he is wrong. I certainly can't stop you from entering in predictions from your TV weatherman to see how they verify...you can be the curmudgeon here!



More generally, by contributing to this campaign, you are helping me undergo a grand experiment that should yield some interesting results:  Can a crowd produce an accurate seasonal weather forecast? Can the crowd match or beat individual expert forecasters?
We can answer these questions with user interest and ongoing participation.
Overtime, the results may become good enough to save lives and dollars.
There are a hand full of brilliant long range forecasters out there now - Joe Bastardi, Dave Tolleris, Joe D'Aleo - but they are aging. One of the benefits of contributing to this campaign would be to help discover the next wave of brilliant long-range forecasters. 
One of the reasons I want web development help is to collect basic user information. We can collect and analyze this information in all sorts of ways.
Do men make better forecasters? How about older people? In our snow experiment, the older folks in the office won the individual months each time, but I, at the age of 27, had the closest seasonal call. Do people living in the area they are forecasting predict differently than people outside the area? 


I am curious to see if studying the weather actually makes you a good forecaster. We could ask people to rate their knowledge of the weather when they sign up and then see if the people who rated themselves highly actually forecast well.
   Risks & Challenges
There are many challenges to this project. One is interest. This campaign is designed not just to raise money, but to see if interest in this project exists on a large enough scale. For forecasts to be possible, users will need to continue to bet their fake currency over time, which means...we need users.


I am hoping the possibility of being known as the best forecaster for something like snowfall outlooks, will keep users interested. I would like to offer some kind of prize, beyond additional fake currency for the winners, but this gets a little bit tricky legally. Still researching how to do this.

To promote interest, I will reach out to various weather forums, weather forecasters with many twitter followers, and use Fiverr favors for promotion. 



In the future, I will also ask users what types of forecasting they would like to see. 




Will Florida get hit by a hurricane this year? 


Will sea ice reach record lows?


Is there really a Maunder Minimum coming? 


Perhaps we could even look at global warming issues. Anything verifiable would be doable with user interest.



One possible final way to keep users interested would be to allow proven users to post forecasts of their choice. The users would be able to sell their forecasts, and keep most of the money (Raindance would keep some of it too.)




I used to work for a video game website, we were never super-popular, but we had steady, reliable users, so I believe once a base of users is established, the site could become quite useful and interesting. 

    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute financially, please pitch the site.  If you are in a sports league - pitch this idea there. This is essentially fantasy weather.

Background: If you play electric guitar, you know that the reason a guitar sounds the way it does is because of the pickups–the electronics underneath the strings–that detect the vibrations of the guitar’s strings. Traditionally, if you want a different guitar sound, you have to buy a completely new guitar or rip your guitar apart, rewire it and put it back together.

<div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Los beneficios que viven los niños:</h3>

</div>
<div>El complemento alimenticio natural que consumen permite brindarles suficientes nutrientes que les ayudan a:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Que no se les caiga el cabello</li>
<li>No sentirse tan débiles después o durante sus quimioterapias</li>
<li>Fortalecer su sistema inmunológico</li>
<li>Fortalecer sus defensas</li>

<div>El complemento alimenticio provee de una gran cantidad de nutrientes que actúan a nivel celular protegiendo los órganos y sistemas durante los tratamientos invasivos a los que es sometido un niño.</div>
<div>Está demostrado científicamente que el cáncer es una enfermedad que tiene origen en la inflamación celular. El complemento ayuda a desinflamar las células de manera natural y disminuir en algunos casos tumores.</div>
<div>Tenemos casos de niños en estado de remisión después del consumo constante y a largo plazo del complemento.</div>
<div>El consumo del complemento no sustituye los tratamientos médicos, sino que es dado como una fuente adicional abundante en nutrientes para su cuerpo.</div>
<div>El complemento no cura el cáncer, pero la cantidad de nutrientes que provee al organismo ayuda a tener más y mejores oportunidades sobrevivir el cáncer.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>Los resultados hasta hoy:</h3>
<br/>
</div>
<div>A partir del 2014 hemos ayudado con el complemento a 50 niños cada mes en la Asociación Luz de Vida en México D.F.</div>
<div>
<p>Los niños que tienen la oportunidad de consumir el complemento por un mínimo de 12 meses viven una calidad de vida mucho mejor que los niños que no lo consumen y pueden tener una recuperación más rápida durante sus tratamientos.</p>
<p>Algunos niños que han consumido el complemento por un lapso mínimo de 12 meses se encuentran en remisión.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Los desafíos:</h3>
<br/>
</div>
<div>Existen alrededor de 200 niños en la Asociación Luz de Vida en espera de algún donador constante. Sin mencionar los 7,000 nuevos casos que se presentan cada año en México.</div>
<div>
<p>Mientras más tiempo consuman los niños este nutriente y lleven a cabo todos sus tratamientos médicos al pie de la letra, mejores son sus probabilidades de sobrevivir.</p>
<p></p>
<p>El desafío más grande al que nos enfrentamos es lograr la donación recurrente del complemento. Necesitamos ayudarlos por un lapso mínimo de 12 meses para que tengan mejores oportunidades de sobrevivir.</p>
<p>Es importante que los niños consuman el complemento de manera diaria y constante para que su cuerpo mantenga altas defensas durante toda la duración de su tratamiento. Muchos tratamientos duran más de 2 años y requieren hasta 30 quimioterapias. Por esto, donar una sola vez ayuda, pero sólo corresponde a la dosis de un mes para un niño. Por esto, lo mínimo que se necesita es que cada niño tenga su dosis de complemento por mínimo 12 meses.</p>

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>About FLOATZ:</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><u>CNC</u></span></a> router normally
has a rigid z-axis where the drive motors control the motion of the z-axis to
cut a part. But for processes like engraving: rigid Z-axis is unsuitable, as it
won’t accommodate variation in sheet height. The FLOATZ as the name suggests
will float/glide on the sheet surface (self-adjust to sheet surface) thus maintaining
uniform engraving depth and also prevent tool jamming due to increased depth of
cut. The FLOATZ will expand the capability of your CNC machine to various
processes like pen-plotting, pencil-plotting, vinyl sticker cutting, engraving,
PCB engraving etc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">About us: We are  passionate users and designers of
CNC machines. We are also passionate about spreading the use of automation in
manufacturing to support the MAKER movement and MAKE IN INDIA movement. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You
Get</b></p>
<p>We are excited to have conceptualised and designed the
FLOATZ. </p>
<p>We are excited about the multi-purpose value-added
utility of FLOATZ to an existing CNC machine owner and happy to share our
invention to the MAKERS of this world. </p>
<p>What we need: We need your enthusiastic support to buy
and use our invention. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Existing CNC machine owners can increase the capability
of their machines to </p>
<ul>
<li>Pen plotting</li>
<li>Pencil plotting</li>
<li>Vinyl Sticker cutting</li>
<li>Drag engraving</li>
<li>Vibro engraving ( using Dremel 290 tool etc. )</li>
<li>Roto engraving ( using Dremel 3000 tool etc.)</li>
<li>PCB engraving, granite engraving, jewellery engraving etc.</li>

More MAKING capabilities, more
fun &amp; value for the MAKERS.<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We have already tested the FloatZ for various processes.
It works great. On vinyl sticker cutting alone: because of the extra cutting
pressure, speeds possible are lesser compared to dedicated Vinyl Sticker

</div></div>","Short Summary
About FLOATZ:
A CNC router normally
has a rigid z-axis where the drive motors control the motion of the z-axis to
cut a part. But for processes like engraving: rigid Z-axis is unsuitable, as it
won’t accommodate variation in sheet height. The FLOATZ as the name suggests
will float/glide on the sheet surface (self-adjust to sheet surface) thus maintaining
uniform engraving depth and also prevent tool jamming due to increased depth of
cut. The FLOATZ will expand the capability of your CNC machine to various
processes like pen-plotting, pencil-plotting, vinyl sticker cutting, engraving,
PCB engraving etc.
About us: We are  passionate users and designers of
CNC machines. We are also passionate about spreading the use of automation in
manufacturing to support the MAKER movement and MAKE IN INDIA movement. 
What We Need & What You
Get
We are excited to have conceptualised and designed the
FLOATZ. 
We are excited about the multi-purpose value-added
utility of FLOATZ to an existing CNC machine owner and happy to share our
invention to the MAKERS of this world. 
What we need: We need your enthusiastic support to buy
and use our invention. 
The Impact
Existing CNC machine owners can increase the capability
of their machines to 

Pen plotting
Pencil plotting
Vinyl Sticker cutting
Drag engraving
Vibro engraving ( using Dremel 290 tool etc. )
Roto engraving ( using Dremel 3000 tool etc.)
PCB engraving, granite engraving, jewellery engraving etc.
Etc.



Compatible with wide range of CNC machines like CNC
milling, CNC router, CNC plasma, CNC oxy-fuel cutters, CNC Laser, CNC WaterJet
etc. 
Compatible with wide range of CNC machine brands like
ShopBot, Roland, MultiCNC, AXYZ,
Sherline, Shapeoko, X-carve etc. 

Compatible tools with floatZ:
Any size pencil, pen, OHP marker pen, CD marker pen, paint brush etc.Dremel 9924 carbide tip ( for drag engraving )Dremel 9929 diamond tip ( for drag engraving )Vinyl cutter blade assembly (http://www.ebay.com/itm/Gold-Blade-Holder-for-Laser-Point-2-Vinyl-Plotter-Cutter-Blade-UsCutter-Roland-/201121960005)Dremel 290 engraverDremel 3000/4000 spindle

More MAKING capabilities, more
fun & value for the MAKERS.
Risks & Challenges
We have already tested the FloatZ for various processes.
It works great. On vinyl sticker cutting alone: because of the extra cutting
pressure, speeds possible are lesser compared to dedicated Vinyl Sticker
cutting machines.

organic, fair trade, non-GMO products on the market.  
                                             

The funds we will raise will go towards salon equipment, the cost of 
renting a building and a start up supply of organic hair color and 
products, and we plan to open in December 2015!   

We will be offering many different perks during the course of this 
campaign, including free services, unlimited discounts, and tickets to 
our classes and events, so be sure to check back in often.We will also be keeping you updated on our progress.
All the proceeds from this campaign will be paid forward to the Western Youth Network (http://www.westernyouthnetwork.org/) 
 over a period of 5 years, regardless of whether we meet our goal or 
not. So when you donate, you will be contributing to two great causes 
instead of just one!

So, Boone and the surrounding area: spread the word!  Even if you 
can't donate, the best contribution you can make is telling a friend, or
 sharing this to your Facebook page. 

We look forward to seeing you all at our Grand Opening!!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

 can gather. Additionally, we will use this funding to host tastings to raise awareness of 
our venue and our mission; Educating consumers about what it's like to Smile, Eat, &amp; Live. Studio B is all about that life! Experiential marketing to the local community and surrounding area is a crucial process for Studio B, and for the health of our business 
overall! <br/><br/>In addition to the building and renovation costs, here is a list of some of the business expenses we are going to tackle:<br/><br/>

<li><p>Marketing material (business cards, menus, flyers, website hosting).</p></li>

We are not picky and very appreciative so we will definitely take what we can get but we're putting it out there...juuuust in case.

<br/><br/><br/>Above all, Thank you to everyone for all your support. We can not do 
this without your help. No matter if you donate or mention us to a friend please stay tuned to what's happening with Studio B - We appreciate You!<br/><br/>'Till Dinner,<br/><br/>Studio B Team<br/></span>
</div></div>","For about 17 years I have been a working Chef; hustling to satisfy my unwavering passion.  Over the years I have worked with some of the industry's finest talent, created beautiful memories, happened upon a ton of culinary and scientific knowledge and served as the personal chef to extremely wonderful clients! I have always been a sharer, sharing my experience and the knowledge bestowed upon me to hungry learners. It is time to give a home to that experience.
Studio B is that home; a start-up venture as a ""brick & mortar"" business. Studio B is where my passion for culinary, the answer to Trenton's limited options for delicious (and consistent) hand baked goods, and a team vision of a great meetup spot join hands. Our menu offers daily old fashioned baked breads and treats, specialty items tailor-made for gluten-free and vegan patrons, light fare with a Louisiana flare and a hint of New Jersey coolness, and beverages for the discerning tastebuds. At Studio B I can share a taste of everything I offer with everyone. At Studio B you are, without a doubt, a guest at my dinner table everyday.
There's much 'a brewing' in Studio B. We have our eyes set on a vacant building in Trenton, NJ. Trenton is welcoming small businesses with open arms and the building is in a NICE location. Lots of foot traffic, a common route home for commuters, and located directly across the street from the Sun Center (Trenton's ""convention"" center). It will be seen by many people and definitely become an everyday eatery for many! 
The plan is for this lovely building to be converted into a venue of culinary mastery. The main floor will house the Bakery, Bistro & Bar. Patrons will be able to walk in and order breakfast, lunch, and/or whatever baked good tickles their fancy for the moment. There will be seating for 20-30 patrons, free Wi-Fi, coffee, a stage for music, local art on the walls, and a Tea Bar for those that want to indulge in my obsession with tea. The Bakery...a.k.a. ""the Studio"" will be dedicated to baking and sharing. Chefs from around the globe will share their talents and experience with hungry 
learners in our in-bakery classroom. And in the same place ALL of the bread and desserts will be created and baked IN HOUSE. The Studio is ultimately our ""creation station"". Would you expect anything else from THIS bakery?? Buttery croissants, crispy po-boy loaves, warm cookies...What! Consultations for celebratory cakes and orders will take place right outside the Studio walls. The smells it will create will make anyone wanna grab a cup of joe or tea and relax for a while.
The Lagniappe (or the 'lil something extra) is that each of the floors' exhausts will be routed to vent through the building making the statement that Studio B is open! Fresh bread and delicious cakes baking...WOW...Its' free sensory marketing!

Over the years, friends and family have lovingly supported us to 
the degree they are able. However, as we are a small enterprise without 
investors, we are now extending to the community for support. This is a two step funding project.
Step 1: Our first goal for funding is $25,000 to cover procurement of the building and to start renovations. We look to you for as much support as we
 can gather. Additionally, we will use this funding to host tastings to raise awareness of 
our venue and our mission; Educating consumers about what it's like to Smile, Eat, & Live. Studio B is all about that life! Experiential marketing to the local community and surrounding area is a crucial process for Studio B, and for the health of our business 
overall! In addition to the building and renovation costs, here is a list of some of the business expenses we are going to tackle:

Purchasing ovens, 
Kitchen rental time (for recipe testing) & food costs, 
Food handling license,  
Insurance & a business licenses, 
Uniforms (Shirts, Aprons, Chef Coats and Hats), 
Marketing material (business cards, menus, flyers, website hosting).

Step 2: Raise the remaining $55,000...Whew! We know that's a lot of pocket change but we are committed and in this to win this. We are not picky and very appreciative so we will definitely take what we can get but we're putting it out there...juuuust in case. We will update later with specifics on how the money is being allocated; but know it is going towards finishing this project and getting Studio B OPEN!

Baked goods baked well are a rare delicacy. We want food to provide the sense of nostalgia. It should get the 
recognition it deserves and reach as many mouths as possible, one bite 
at a time!  We understand some people just can't contribute financially, but we still need your help:
Please share this with your friends! Crowdfunding Campaigns 
have a 90% chance of FAILURE. That means out of our core 100 FB friends, 
only 10 will actually donate. If all 100 friends shared with their 100 
friends (or even 50), we can reach between 5,000 and 10,000 people. Just
 by sharing the news you have effectively increased our chances of 
reaching our goal.

Your donation will help bring the dream of a ""brick & mortar"" Bakery
 to fruition! Every donation, big or small, will help us get one step 
closer
 to fulfilling our ultimate goal--launching our business and helping 
people live through food.
Cooking great food is meant to be 
shared and eaten. Whether it's raising money or sitting down and 
reconnecting over a hot meal, we need people to join us.
Share via Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, EMAIL! Contact us 
directly if you have any questions. We will be happy to address any early
 concerns.



                                                         What You'll get: 
All of our Perks are tailored for each level of contribution and each is named for a crucial tool or person within the kitchen (at least in our kitchen). Check 'em out to the right, and for those new to the kitchen, here's some explanations/definitions of the tools used to describe our contribution levels...Welcome!Let's talk about that big 'ole elephant in the room...Restaurants are the 
riskiest businesses to start. High overhead, fluctuating food cost, 
labor, and changing trends. Bakeries, however, are steadily climbing and succeeding - especially those catering to the special dietary needs of this day and age. 

We minimize our risks and challenges by:
Having a spectacular team in place that have experience and knowledge about the journey we are embarking upon. We also have a wealth of consultants ready to give advice if we need (or don't need...) it.  
Keeping ourselves honest. Our team holds each other accountable for our actions and we discuss matters together before deciding. 
Necessity first, desires only if we can. Debt is the number one reason most small businesses fail. We are committed to making sound decisions and sticking to a modest budget to ensure success.
Steadily 
building a solid following. We need you! If you share we increase our chances of success.








Above all, Thank you to everyone for all your support. We can not do 
this without your help. No matter if you donate or mention us to a friend please stay tuned to what's happening with Studio B - We appreciate You!'Till Dinner,Studio B Team",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>We're here to support these people.  I have made magical delights with 3 cookie sheets, my home oven,  and a bistro table.  We could do so much more.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Moving into restaurants and cafes was always the dream; we just never thought the opportunity would arise so quickly.  You are making a dream come true. </span>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> We could fail. We could get our food into the restaurants and people decline the offer to buy. The food business is a risky bet. Some people's taste buds are more precise than others.  That's why I moved from tasters to trusting my own opinion. If I like the product it goes to my test market. If I don't, and I can't stand behind it...there's no need to offer it.  </p>
<p>We could underprice ourselves out of the market.  However, I have taken classes and gained business mentors to support this endeavor.  We've diversified our offerings so we are not solely relying on Coconut Ladies. We create and test one new product every week.  We are currently testing gluten free options as well as traditional flavors.  Some make it to the Instagram page and others make it to the garbage. </p>
<p>Our kitchen vendor could close or lose its health department certificate.  There are a plethora of other kitchens in the area that I have contacted.  I chose this one because of the cost, proximity, and additional perks (space to meet with clients, gluten free facility, etc.). Additionally, I have a food worker card through the WA State Department of Public Health.  I taught Nutrition and Wellness in Seattle Public Schools where I was responsible for training students and using a commercial kitchen safely.  I have also attended workshops on food allergies and cross-contamination.   </p>
<p>As a teacher, I encourage my students to never give up, to try their best, and to play with a problem until a solution presents itself.  If there is a problem, I have mentors and resources to gain the answers. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Mildred's Confections is an online bakery that features ""Homemade Treats Without the Hassle.""
Our first product was Coconut Ladies. My grandmother, Mildred,  taught me how to make them when I was a little girl. As customers asked, we added more products including:


 Ghirardelli White Chocolate Walnut cookies, 
Ghirardelli Chocolate Chunk cookies, 
Brownies with salted walnuts and crushed Ghirardelli chocolate, 

Lemon Brownies,  


& Nutella oatmeal raisin cookies. 



We have the opportunity to expand into restaurants and cafes, but need to update our business structure and required licenses with the state of Washington before we can do so. 
   What We Need & What You Get To enter into wholesale restaurant and cafe markets, we need to get additional licensing from the Washington State Department of Agriculture.  Also, we will have to expand our kitchen capacity.  
Here is the budget breakdown:  
    

$230 Washington State Department of Agriculture (food processors license)
$200 Washington Secretary of State (change business structure)
$45 Commercial Size Baking Sheets (4 from Amazon)
$350 Quality Commercial Mixer 
$ 2300 Commercial Kitchen Deposit ($500) & 3 months Rental Fee ($600 per month)
$225 Crowdfunding Fees (up to 9% of monies collected).
If we get more money than we need, we will look to paying up more kitchen rental and bringing on an assistant making a living wage.  
In exchange, you will have the option of the following: 


Mucho thanks and mentions via our social media platforms.
Mildred's Manifesto - words of wisdom that we live and cook by. 
A dozen Ghirardelli Chocolate Chunk Cookies

Mildred's Confections Mystery Box- a mixed box of 24 treats for your eating or sharing pleasure.

   The Impact Your support will allow us to be more time efficient, reduce our overhead costs, all while reaching a wider audience of Mildred's Confections fans and fans to be. You will help a home based baker move into the big leagues.  We will up our credibility with additional licenses that allow us to sell more products. 
 Mildred's Confections relieves the stress of homemade baking by providing  ""Homemade Treats Without the Hassle."" 

You will help eliminate nasty freezer burned or stale desserts from your potluck or next event.  
You will help eliminate fights over who is going to clean the messy-baked-in kitchen. 
You will help relieve the anxiety of many people who are expected to bake at a moments notice, but have no time or care to do so.  
You will reduce the number of runs to the grocery store because who just has vanilla, butter, sugar, flour, salt, baking powder, and brown sugar - on hand? 
You will eliminate the need for people to have contraptions - stand mixers with dough hooks, paddle attachments, and whisks.  What happened to just having the basic mixer?
AND you will reduce the stress of every person who is trying to put a dessert on the table but looks like this

We're here to support these people.  I have made magical delights with 3 cookie sheets, my home oven,  and a bistro table.  We could do so much more.  Moving into restaurants and cafes was always the dream; we just never thought the opportunity would arise so quickly.  You are making a dream come true. 
   Risks & Challenges  We could fail. We could get our food into the restaurants and people decline the offer to buy. The food business is a risky bet. Some people's taste buds are more precise than others.  That's why I moved from tasters to trusting my own opinion. If I like the product it goes to my test market. If I don't, and I can't stand behind it...there's no need to offer it.  
We could underprice ourselves out of the market.  However, I have taken classes and gained business mentors to support this endeavor.  We've diversified our offerings so we are not solely relying on Coconut Ladies. We create and test one new product every week.  We are currently testing gluten free options as well as traditional flavors.  Some make it to the Instagram page and others make it to the garbage. 
Our kitchen vendor could close or lose its health department certificate.  There are a plethora of other kitchens in the area that I have contacted.  I chose this one because of the cost, proximity, and additional perks (space to meet with clients, gluten free facility, etc.). Additionally, I have a food worker card through the WA State Department of Public Health.  I taught Nutrition and Wellness in Seattle Public Schools where I was responsible for training students and using a commercial kitchen safely.  I have also attended workshops on food allergies and cross-contamination.   
As a teacher, I encourage my students to never give up, to try their best, and to play with a problem until a solution presents itself.  If there is a problem, I have mentors and resources to gain the answers. 
On the flip side, we could SUCCEED beyond our WILDEST DREAMS! You could be a part of  our success story.

<p>Gush Etzion is filled with independent
workers, consultants, and telecommuters, some of whom work US hours.
The lack of professional, suitable office space in Gush Etzion has
meant until now that most work from home, coffee shops, or empty
apartments that are isolating.  Hub Etzion offers a place to work
that isn’t a living room. It is a  <b>professional</b> place to meet with
clients and an<b> environment that increases focus and productivity
</b>while creating organic opportunities for networking and
collaboration. <b>Hub Etzion empowers local business owners to thrive
and grow</b> through such networking, collaboration, professional
services offered on site and by the sheer empowerment of the new,
shared economy.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438820955/ufhqw7dkvy6kvafwjhhg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>By harnessing the potential of the

people of Gush Etzion, creating, developing, and retaining businesses
and startups, we can make Gush Etzion an essential part of Israel’s
landscape.

    “I’m actually experiencing
[first hand] the “shared economy”. I’m being exposed to people
who are self-starters, who think big and do big things. Being brought
into the conversation of start up people has already made me want to
do bigger, think bigger and share.”- Avital, Early Adopter,
Independent Language Specialist
When is Hub Etzion Opening?



How Can You Help Hub Etzion?
We have secured a bank loan and some
private investment to begin renovations and make Hub Etzion a
reality. We still need $50,000 to finish and furnish it so it can be
the place where people and businesses flourish. The more we raise,
the more amazing Hub Etzion can be. 
Not everyone is prepared or able to be
a large sum investor. You can still make a difference. By giving what
you can to this project, you are investing - in us, in the people of
Gush Etzion, in the growth of businesses in Israel.

(If you want to be a large sum
investor, contact us! We would love to tell you more.)

Who is Hub Etzion?


Amy Shuter & Rachel Moore
 As the founders of Hub Etzion we are
dedicated to the people, communities, and businesses of Gush Etzion.
We personally know how community can change your life. In fact, we
met in the online community of bloggers before we became neighbors,
friends, and business partners. 
Rachel Moore
Director of PR/Marketing, HubEtzion
Owner, Moore International Connections
PR & Communications


Rachel has been a Communications
professional working in Israel and the United States for 20 years,
With a majority of her experience in the public and non-profit
sectors, she has been a part of establishing other community-growth
related enterprises. She is a former speaker for CAMERA, a founding
board member of the Netivot Montessori School, a member of the
fundraising committee for the Women’s Beit Midrash of Efrat, and on
the PR and Development Committee for Raise Your Spirits Theater
Company. She brings that experience and passion for helping others to
Hub Etzion. Rachel has eight children, which has often felt like the
creation of a not-so-small business of a very different sort.

    “I fervently believe that the
Jewish response to the BDS movement is “investment, not
divestment.” The economic improvement and prosperity of this region
will benefit all residents and change the geopolitical dynamics for
the better. For everyone living here. “

Amy Shuter
COO, Hub Etzion
Amy has a Master’s Degree in Library
and Information Science.  She spent many years developing,
restructuring, and managing libraries.  Amy served as the Chief
Administrative Officer of the Jewish Children's Museum where she
built the organizational infrastructure as the Museum expanded from
its infancy.  She brings to Hub Etzion her talent for multitasking
and long range planning, her management experience, research
capabilities and attention to detail.  As a widow and mother of
triplets, she has learned not only the strength of survival, but has
been “kicking the ‘stuff’ out of plan B”. She feels a
tremendous personal debt to the community of Gush Etzion for helping
her build her family back up after the loss of her husband. It is
this sense of indebtedness that fuels her tireless efforts to give
back. 



    “Living in Gush Etzion during the
hardest time of my life taught me about resilience, strength and how
the community can benefit the individual. Hub Etzion is the chance
for me to take my professional experience and my personal experience
and give back. I believe in the people of Gush Etzion. They are
creative, collaborative and hard-working. The potential for growth
and prosperity is boundless. And they deserve it.”

</p>
<p>Welcome to Dr Zigs, where we make and sell kits to create extraordinary,
giant bubbles. Our bubbles have taken us to loads of places; from their
mountain home in North Wales, to festivals, parties, carnivals, weddings, and
many more special occasions across the UK, Europe and beyond. </p>
<p>Ethical and environmental
values underpin absolutely everything we do, from the sourcing of our
materials to the recycling of our mix. We also have an ever-growing bubble
community, and are able to provide over 30 local jobs as a result. We want to make
people happy. By doing business responsibly, by sourcing sustainably and by
bubbling continuously! But to keep doing good, our packaging needs to change.
We need to raise £5,000 to design packaging that reflects these
values, and helps us to cover the world in bubbles. </p>
<p></p>
</div><div><h3>The Story  </h3></div><div>
<p>We first stumbled upon the magic of
bubbles when my son Ziggy was a toddler - he would get fits of giggles whenever
a bubble floated his way.  I’m not sure
if we were more hooked on the bubbles or Ziggy’s laughter, but either way it
led to more and ever bigger bubbles - my husband researched and experimented
until we had a pretty awesome bubble mix. 
We bottled one of those early batches up and took it down to the beach and
ended up selling every bottle we had.  </p>
<p>And so Dr Zigs Extraordinary
Bubbles was born. As my son grew up, so did the business. We went from the
kitchen table of a small quarryman’s cottage in North Wales, to a garden shed,
to a new building, to two new buildings, to the very new and wonderful headquarters
where we are based today! </p>
<p>The driving force behind Dr Zigs is
to do business in a way that is totally sustainable and ethically responsible. I
started the business because I loved seeing the happiness that bubbles could
bring, not only to my son, but to everyone. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436268462/m5uo3ek5k7gzwaqylspk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>These ethical and environmental values underpin everything we do. Our bubble mix is green in every sense
of the word. With Bangor University, we’ve developed a bubble mix that is guaranteed phosphate-free.  It even has less surfactant (goopy stuff) than a bottle of Ecover. We use 100% untreated cotton for our UK manufactured bubbling
ropes. One day soon we hope to be using nothing but Fairtrade cotton.<br/>
</p>
<p>We also care about our communities
and economies.  Dr Zigs has an
ever-growing bubble crew, now providing more than 30 jobs in North Wales. We love showing children that you can make a business out of anything
(even bubbles!) and have had the opportunity to communicate this to thousands
of kids and adults through the work that we do.  </p>
<p>We also run a project called
Bubbles Not Bombs, where we send bubbles out to kids who need them round the
world - kids who could just do with a few moments of play.  So far our bubbles have gone to Romania,
Kenya, Uganda, Chernobyl, Delhi and even to a refugee camp in Libya. </p>
<p>Our motto here at Dr Zigs is simple
– ""Changing the World One Bubble at a Time""</p>
<p>  Dr Zigs isn’t just about bubbles. It’s about
making a difference. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Our current packaging is still
pretty much what I created back at our kitchen table using MS Publisher and clip art.  It’s no
longer fit for what is a really cool and wonderful product – and certainly no
good for helping us to <b>#sharethebubblelove</b>.
</p>
<p>We have a lot more people to make
happy, but in order to be stocked in shops, and to be considered by
distributors, we need packaging that is not only good for the environment, but
also looks good too. We want to communicate the huge amount of excitement and
goodness a little bottle of bubble mix can bring, so we can fill the world with
bubbles, far beyond North Wales!</p>
<h3>
</h3>
<p><b>We need: </b></p>
<p>-  £5,000
– this will form the basis of the packaging budget, allowing us to redesign our
packaging and make it more fun and ecologically friendly.  We’re currently seeking the advice of some top bubble packaging experts – our customers!  We’ve put a call out to children to come up
with ideas for us, and hopefully some of these will get used in our new design.
 We’ve budgeted £1500 for design work to
translate our ideas into drawings, £500 for materials, £2500 for prototyping,  and £500 for print work. </p> <span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">What you get</span><p>

<p><strong>            Dying is
a difficult subject to talk about, so let’s talk about it.</strong></p>
<p>  Hello, welcome to Nuntias. We are a small startup
seeking help in funding our new website <a href=""http://www.nuntias.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.nuntias.com</u></a>.</p>
<p>  The word <i>Nuntias</i> is a Latin word that means
“Messengers” and the purpose of our website is to help give people a better
understanding of the end of life process through our user submitted videos. It
is our mission to help terminally ill people and their family members not only
to understand that they are not alone in their journey, but to give them the opportunity
to talk about their own personal experience or whatever they feel is important
for others to know from their own perspective about the dying process.</p>
<p>  We are currently using a temporary website <a href=""http://www.nuntias.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.nuntias.com</u></a> and are seeking funding
to build and operate a much more sophisticated user interactive website. Any
funding raised will be used for building our new site, legal fees, advertising and other startup costs. All aspects of our site will be absolutely free to all users to
ensure that everyone can participate.</p>
<p>  Nuntias.com will provide a safe platform for
patients, family members, health care professionals, survivors and clergy
members to help inform and educate others about the end of life process. Aside
from user videos, Nuntias.com will also feature a section for books and
articles that provide people with important and useful information about the
dying process. We will also be producing a monthly doc-u-series titled <i>Before
I Go </i>that will be made up of the more memorable and important points of our
user contributed videos.</p>
<p>  Nuntias.com will also help to raise money for
charities related to fighting terminal illnesses. The “Donations” section of
Nuntias.com will be entirely devoted to helping users that wish to donate to
charities that are close to their hearts. Nuntias.com will not accept any form
of payments through our own site, so through links to the charities, users will
be taken directly to their selected charity to make their donations. Users may
also request to have a charity added to our donations section.</p>
<p>  In addition to helping fund our Nuntias.com
campaign we need help getting the word out about our site. We are asking
EVERYONE to please send us an email at <a href=""mailto:Nuntias1@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Nuntias1@gmail.com</u></a>
and put the word “Friend” in the subject line. Once our new site is complete we
will send you an email asking you to help launch our site by contacting as many
people as you can via, email, Facebook and twitter and letting everyone you can
know that we are here and ready to serve.</p>
<p>Also, we are looking for videos from people who would like to tell their
stories and provide others with their thoughts. So if you are a survivor of a
terminal illness, have ever lost a loved one to terminal illness or know someone
who is battling a terminal illness, please consider contributing your own
video. The more insight we can help give to others the better we will become.</p>
<p>  For anyone who has ever battled or has lost a
loved one to terminal illness, you understand exactly how important Nuntias.com
will be for others. For those who have never had to go through the experience
of losing a loved one to terminal illness, this site is for you.</p>
<p>  It is our hope that with your help, Nuntias.com
will be there to potentially help millions of people in the very near future. </p>

<li><p>food (sandwiches and snacks)</p></li>
<li><p>a reusable water bottle full of ice water</p></li>
<li><p>personal care items, such as toothbrush and toothpaste, deodorant, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Your name will be featured on our website next to those of our other wonderful supporters.  (All contribution levels.)</p></li>
<li><p>We’ll post a personal shout-out to you on Facebook, thanking your for your support.  ($10)</p></li>

<li>And finally, a wonderful way of supporting our mission is to carry our message with you in your own life.  Spread the word that a person’s worth does not depend on their religious perspective.  Serve as a living example of human goodness that does not depend on religion or belief in God/s.  Be good, for nothing!  </li>
</ul><p></p></div>","Who we are:We are self-proclaimed secular missionaries.  By that, we mean that we are committed to doing good in the world, not just out of the goodness of our own hearts, but on behalf of all those who are good, with or without religion and with or without God.  We serve in the name of the human spirit.  And with faith that that’s enough.To meet our team members and learn more about us, click here.What we’re doing:For this project, we are putting together care packages that we will be distributing to people affected by homelessness in Portland, Oregon.  Our delivery date is set for August 22nd.  Our goal is to give out 50 packs, which will include the following:
food (sandwiches and snacks)
a reusable water bottle full of ice water
personal care items, such as toothbrush and toothpaste, deodorant, etc.
socks
sanitary products for women (some packs)
dog food, for people with canine companions (some packs)
a printed list of local resources for those experiencing homelessness
a pamphlet explaining who we are and our mission
a handwritten note
an invitation to submit a piece of writing to be published on our blog, and supplies for doing so (pen, paper, envelope, stamp, etc.)
all in a cotton, drawstring bag
What we need:Our goal of $3000 is based on a budget for the contents and distribution of 50 care packages.  The breakdown of where that money will go looks like this:What you get:We think the coolest thing about contributing to this campaign is that it is, at any contribution level, a vote of confidence for human goodness.  It says that, whether or not you’re religious, and whether or not you believe in God/s, you are a good person.  That you believe the goodness in others does not depend on their religion or beliefs about God/s.  And you believe that the people we’re serving with this project - and that people in general - deserve respect regardless of their religious beliefs and deserve support without spiritual strings attached.  That’s a pretty cool statement to make.But in addition to making an awesome statement, you get perks!  Higher contribution amounts come with greater perks, and each level of contribution comes with the perks from all the lower levels.  Here are some things we’re offering:
Your name will be featured on our website next to those of our other wonderful supporters.  (All contribution levels.)
We’ll post a personal shout-out to you on Facebook, thanking your for your support.  ($10)
We’ll create a personalized “(Your Name) is good for nothing” image for you with your face on it for you to use as you wish.  We’ll also send you a 3” x 5” vinyl Secular Missionaries sticker.  ($25)






We’ll send a personal message from you to the recipients of our care packages.  Got a favorite quote or something you want them to know?  Words of your choosing** will be included in our printed materials.  We’ll also send you Secular Missionaries car magnet.  ($50)
We’ll make a personal thank you video for you from the day of the project.  We’ll also send you a DIY Kit (5 of our cotton drawstring sacks, 5 of our reusable water bottles and instructions) so you can spread the love in your own town.  ($100)
We’ll plant a tree in your name with Friends of Trees and send you a Secular Missionaries Tshirt.  ($500)
We’ll hold a beach clean-up event in your name.  ($1000)

</b></p><p><b>Con tu
apoyo podemos re-estructurar y expandir el apiario, proveerle trabajo a ex-convictos
y familiares a través de la apicultura y educar sobre las abejas! </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Nuestra
miel viene de abejas africanizadas que se reproducen mucho
más rápido y necesitan unas cajas especializadas. Nuestras colmenas están
libres de químicos, antibióticos y son hogar de abejas que recorren la isla!</p><p>
</p><p>El sábado, 29 de agosto comenzamos un curso para trabajar con
abejas que se dará todos los sábados consecutivos hasta el 24 de octubre. Nos
interesa que la agricultura pueda ser un trabajo para el pueblo. </p>
<p>Por
lo que hemos desarrollado tres cursos para formar Promotores de Agroecología
Bieke (2013-2015). La formación de promotores se basa en la metodología
campesino a campesino que busca entrenar de manera horizontal partiendo del
conocimiento agrícola que tengamos y requiere de un compromiso entre los que
luego pasan a ser promotores de agroecología, con seguir practicando la
agricultura y enseñando sobre la misma.</p>
<p>El
primer curso se ofreció en el huerto comunitario de la Esperanza que Ique,
Miguelina, Hilda y Elías llevan trabajando por unos años. El curso facilitó la
expansión del huerto y la organización del mismo a lo que hoy día llamamos
Finca Comunitaria Sembrando Esperanza en la Esperanza. El segundo vino siendo
un intercambio entre huertos comunitarios e interesados con el Huerto
Comunitario de César Coca y el Huerto Comunitario de Lucila Franco. Hace dos
meses culminamos el curso para promotores en la Finca Conciencia en Monte
Carmelo.</p>
<p>El
Proyecto Las Abejas busca capacitar y adiestrar a confinados, ex-confinados y
familiares mediante la producción agroecológica, la preparación de promotores
agroecológicos, y la promoción de la justicia social y ambiental. Empoderando y
apoyando a confinados, ex confinados y familiares para crecer, mercadear y
educar sobre alimentos sanos, ampliando las oportunidades de empleo y
acercándonos a la soberanía alimentaria en el archipiélago de Puerto Rico. A su
vez reducimos riesgos, aumentamos la sustentabilidad y resiliencia en comunidad
y proveemos seguridad alimentaria. Como las abejas entendemos que podemos
organizarnos, y trabajar duro entre todos para una mejor convivencia. </p>
<p><b><u>Sobre las abejas</u></b></p><p><b><u></u></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442196243/bwe9lisby8zqedcj40l4.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 268.333px; height: 285px;""/></p>
<p>Las
abejas son vitales para que nos alimentamos, ya que son las encargadas
principales de transportar el polen para fecundar los óvulos de las flores. Lo
que se le llama polinización. Sin ellas todos los árboles con flores, que dan
frutas dejarían a la larga de reproducirse, causando un desastre alimentario
mundial. 1/3 parte de la comida que consumimos los humanos depende de las
abejas. 3/4 partes de las plantas del planeta dependen de la polinización para
reproducirse, y las abejas son cruciales para que esto sea así. 1
colmena poliniza 3 millones de flores por día. Una colmena es una comunidad
organizada de abejas que vive en una caja preparada. La reina pone hasta 2
millones de huevos en su vida productiva y en una colmena de 30,000 abejas
existen 100 zánganos, el resto son trabajadoras. Los zánganos no tienen
aguijones, solo están para aparearse. La próxima vez que le digas zángano a
alguien piensa en las abejas. </p>
<p>Para
comer las quenepas, aguacates, cacao (de donde proviene el chocolate), limón,
naranja y tomarnos ese rico café necesitamos a las abejas. En Estados Unidos
los agricultores buscan desesperadamente a los apicultores para polinizar las
grandes extensiones de almendros de California, donde se estima que son
necesarias más de un millón de colmenas cada año. En Florida pasa otro tanto
con los cítricos, ya que tienen muy claro que las abejas pueden mejorar hasta
un 60% la producción cada año.</p>
<p><i>Una colonia completa de abejas se enferma y muere en
un periodo de dos semanas. Hasta el momento, cerca de la mitad de las abejas en
Europa y Estados Unidos han desaparecido repentinamente de esa forma, y los
científicos conocen este fenómeno como el Problema de Colapso de Colonias (CCD,
por sus siglas en inglés). </i>(Suzanna Engman, Revista de Investigación Inventio) Las
causas mayores por su muerte son la agricultura industrial, la pérdida de
hábitat y los pesticidas tóxicos. Todo esto hace que las abejas se debiliten y
mueran rápidamente y las ha hecho mucho más susceptibles a enfermedades y
plagas. Entre estas se encuentra un ácaro sanguijuela que se les pega y trata
de chupar su sangre y la de sus larvas. Este ácaro se llama varroa. Aunque es
más pequeño que los puntos en esta oración, para una abeja es grande,
vendría siendo como del tamaño de un gato para nosotros. Este ácaro se adhiere
a la abeja y le crea heridas abiertas que las dejan más susceptibles a
infecciones. Las abejas africanizadas han mostrado ser mucho más resistentes a
la varroa, ya que pelean por sus vidas intentando eliminarlo. Aquí estamos
hablando de abejas Apis mellifera, la abeja relacionada a la miel y de Apis
mellifera europea y africanizadas. Por eso apostamos a la agricultura ecológica
y a la inclusión de abejas africanizadas en nuestros apiarios. Es lo único que
puede cambiar el estado actual de las abejas. </p>
<p><b><u>Sobre las abejas
africanizadas en Vieques </u></b></p>
<p>En
Puerto Rico y en muchos países no quieren a las abejas africanizadas, ni
siquiera se quiere hacer mención de ellas por su fama de asesinas. Sin embargo
esta abeja está establecida en Puerto Rico desde los años 80, no se sabe bien
los cruces que ha generado pero se entiende que es menos agresiva que en muchos
países del mundo. En el 2005 cuando las abejas melíferas del mundo empiezan a
tener trastornos, comienzan las investigaciones en laboratorios en Europa y
Estados Unidos para ver como se podía bajar la agresividad en las abejas
africanizadas. Estas investigaciones se dan desde grandes laboratorios, pero ya
en Vieques se han observado cruces con las abejas africanizadas y en la
práctica se ha hecho mucho trabajo con ellas. La propuesta entonces es
establecer apiarios africanizados en Vieques que a su vez sirven como una
especie de laboratorio. Jorge Cora lleva investigando las abejas africanizadas
desde el 1996 y a través de un curso que tomó de apicultura en el 2005 comienza
a hablar sobre la africanización y hacer pruebas con cera estampada. Las abejas
europeas ponen 2,000 huevos diarios, mientras que las abejas africanizadas ponen
4,000 huevos diarios. Además la abeja africanizada <i>Apis mellifera</i> nace dos días antes a la europea <i>Apis mellifera</i>, son más pequeñas pero
son más veloces y visitan mayor cantidad de flores. Son más defensivas, pero
esto no significa tengan ningún interés en picarte así por que sí, van a
proteger su colmena con más tenacidad de depredadores. Por lo tanto con estas
ventajas, hay que darle la oportunidad a las abejas africanizadas. Darle la
oportunidad a las abejas africanizadas salvaría el mundo, es vital no temerle a
las abejas de esta especie.</p><p>
</p><p><b><u>Sobre Finca Conciencia:</u></b></p>
<p>En
Puerto Rico se importa más del 85% de lo que se consume, en Vieques la cifra es
aún mayor. Actualmente la seguridad alimentaria en Vieques es una precaria, por
lo que nos hemos dado a la tarea de facilitar la producción, distribución y
comercialización de la agricultura local. La familia promedio come productos
enlatados a diario, que además de tomar el ferry toman buques, aviones y
camiones tardándose semanas para llegar a nuestra mesa. Si en Puerto Rico
ocurriese una crisis en los puertos habría comida para tan solo cuatro días,
¿qué pasaría en Vieques?</p>
<p>La
Finca Conciencia comenzó hace ocho años con la preocupación del agricultor
Jorge Cora de producir lo que comía y para el pueblo. La finca se ha
desarrollado a pico y pala por los últimos años, sin maquinaria ni insumos
tóxicos como los pesticidas y herbicidas. Actualmente sirve como una especie de
finca escuela. En los últimos meses hemos celebrado una Finca Abierta, visitas
guiadas a escuelas y jóvenes, días de brigadas de trabajo, un cine foro con la
coordinadora de una escuela de formación del Movimiento de los Sin Tierra en
Brasil (gracias a la Organización de Agricultura Ecológica Boricuá), talleres
sobre abejas y apicultura y un curso para promotores de agroecología Bieké.
Gracias a los estudiantes de la Escuela 20 de Septiembre y la maestra Elda

<p><b><u>Un poco sobre nosotros:</u></b></p>
<p>¡Ana
Elisa y Jorge Cora van a expandir el apiario! Por treinta años Jorge Cora ha
estado trabajando con abejas, en Vieques lo conocen como el Hombre Abeja! Por
más de treinta años lleva sembrando de manera sostenible en su pueblo de
nacimiento, Arroyo y 8 años en Vieques. Vieques es caliente y susceptible a
sequías, Jorge pensó que sería un desafío comenzar una finca en Vieques y se
tiró para crear un modelo que le enseñara a la gente que todo era posible con
la agricultura sostenible. Ana Elisa ha estado trabajando con proyectos de
agricultura sostenible desde que tenía trece años de edad, el rescate de un
solar abandonado en su escuela y la comunidad, la organizando agricultores y
formando promotores de Agroecología en Vieques, México, Haití y Guatemala y
facilitando el desarrollo de huertos y fincas comunitarias en Vieques y Puerto
Rico. Hace apenas ocho meses se mudó a Finca Conciencia donde está ayudando a
desarrollar aún más el apiario, creando cursos y actividades educativas.</p>
<p><b><u>Sobre Apiarios Bieké y el Proyecto Las

<p>Jorge
Cora estuvo encarcelado durante cuatro años, cuando en la cárcel pensaba en la
importancia de mostrar a los demás confinados sus capacidades para proveerse
puestos de trabajo a sí mismos a través de la agricultura ecológica. Esta es la
razón por la cual Finca Conciencia comenzó con ya más de 20 cajas que hay que
arreglar y adaptar para las abejas africanizadas. Ana Elisa ha estado
trabajando con huertos comunitarios desde que era muy joven y encuentra de la
mayoría de los mete-mano han sido ex-confinados (y familiares) que no podían
encontrar trabajo a causa de sus antecedentes penales. El Proyecto Las Abejas
es para todos; no nos fijamos en sus antecedentes penales, pero sí en su ética
de trabajo. El Proyecto Las Abejas capacita a futuros agricultores/as
ecológicos dentro y fuera de una diversidad de instituciones correccionales y a
sus familias. La certificación de los participantes proporciona un espacio para
desarrollar, producir y educar sobre la agricultura ecológica como un modelo
socioeconómico alternativo. Capacitar y apoyar a los confinados, ex confinados,
y familiares en comunidades marginadas para cultivar alimentos saludables,
implica la ampliación de las oportunidades de empleo y que nos acerca a la

------ENGLISH-----------------------------<p><b>With your support we can replace outdated
beekeeping boxes, provide jobs for the formerly incarcerated through beekeeping
and educate about bees!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our honey comes from Vieques’ africanized bees that have
outgrown our hives. Our hives are chemical-free, antibiotic-free and home to
bees that fly around our island. </p>
<p><b><u>About Africanized bees </u></b></p><p><u>(watch this video about Africanized bees in Puerto Rico: <a href=""http://www.smithsonianmag.com/ist/?next=/videos/category/science/why-puerto-ricos-killer-bees-stopped-killing/)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/ist/?next=/videos/category/science/why-puerto-ricos-killer-bees-stopped-killing/)</a></u></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>Bees are vital to us as they are responsible
for carrying pollen to fertilize the eggs of flowers. This is called
pollination. Without them all flowering plants that give fruits would
eventually cease to reproduce, causing a global food disaster. 1/3 of the food
that humans consume depend on bees. One hive can pollinate over 3 million
flowers per day. An organized community of bees that live in a box made for
that specific purpose is a hive. We can eat quenepas, avocados, cacao
(chocolate), lemons, and oranges thanks to bees. </p>
<p>About half of the
bees in Europe and United States have suddenly died from what scientists have
named Colony Collapse Disorder where a full colony of bees gets sick and die in
a period of two weeks. The major causes for his death are industrial
agriculture and toxic pesticides. This makes bees die quickly or become sick
and are more susceptible to diseases and pests. Among these is a mite called
varroa, that tries to suck their blood and larvae, which leaves bees with open
wounds that make them more susceptible to infection. Africanized bees have
shown to be more resistant to varroa, as they fight for their lives trying to
eliminate it. </p>
<p>In Puerto Rico and in
many countries people don’t want Africanized bees, because of their killer bee
reputation. However, this bee is present in Puerto Rico since the 80s, studies
have not yet found exactly how they are crossing among European bees but they
are known to be less aggressive than in many countries. When honeybees started
to have problems, the research began in laboratories in Europe and the United
States to see how they could lower the aggressiveness of Africanized bees. In
Vieques already beekeepers have observed less aggressive Africanized bees.
Jorge Cora has been investigating Africanized bees since 1996 and through a course
that he took on beekeeping in 2005 he begins tests with the beeswax. European
bees could lay 2,000 eggs a day, while Africanized bees could lay 4,000 eggs a day. The
Africanized Apis mellifera is born two days before the European Apis mellifera,
also Africanized bees are smaller but faster and can visit more flowers a day.
They are more defensive, but this isn’t to sting you, they will protect their
hive with more tenacity against predators. So with these advantages, we must
give the opportunity to Africanized bees. Africanized bees could save the
World. </p>

<p><b><u>About Finca Conciencia:  </u></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Finca Conciencia is a small off-grid farm and apiary in
Vieques that focuses on the beauty and bounties of our Monte Carmelo.
Apiculture has a strong agriculture base in the Caribbean. Everyone needs to
eat and there is little to none fresh, locally grown crops. Finca Conciencia
began seven years ago with the concern of farmer Jorge Cora to eat and produce
local food due to the 85% of imported produce in Puerto Rico. In Vieques this
rate is even higher. The farm has been developed with no machinery or toxic
inputs such as pesticides and herbicides. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We are now transforming the farm into a sort of farm school,
as an incubator farm for Proyecto Las Abejas. In recent months we have held an
Open House, tours for schools and youth, workdays, bee-keeping workshops and
movie forums. Thanks to the students of the 20 de Septiembre Middle School and
their teacher Elda Guadalupe we have organized a seed bank of local seeds in
Vieques. We produce honey and a great variety of vegetables that we sell to
local businesses, restaurants and residents every Tuesday and Friday.</p>
<p><b><u>A little bit about us:</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>Ana Elisa and Jorge Cora are expanding the apiary! For 10
years Jorge has been working with bees in Vieques, were he is better known as
the ""Bee Man"". He has been farming sustainably for more than 30 years
in his hometown in Arroyo and 8 years in Vieques. Vieques is hot, and prone to
drought, Jorge thought it would be a challenge to farm in Vieques and was up to
develop a project were he could teach people that anything was possible with
sustainable agriculture. Ana Elisa has been working with sustainable
agriculture projects since she was thirteen years old, rescuing an abandoned
lot at her school and community, organizing farmer to farmer training(s) in
Puerto Rico, México, Haiti and Guatemala and community gardens in Vieques and
Puerto Rico. Just a few months ago she moved to Finca Conciencia were she is
helping further develop the apiary, setting up courses and educational
activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u>About Vieques
Apiary and The Bee(s) Project: </u></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>In Vieques the unemployment rate is 60%, so we promote
educational projects in agriculture, to help us re-think ourselves within the
island's agricultural economy. From August 29 to October 24 we will meet every
Saturday in Finca Conciencia to teach a course on bees. The interest of this
course is to train a group in Vieques of producers of honey and other bee
products. It will be
free for the formerly incarcelated and families, as we want Apiarios Bieké to
be one of the incubators for Proyecto Las Abejas. Jorge Cora was incarcerated
for four years, when in prison he thought about the importance to show inmates
their abilities to provide jobs for themselves through agriculture. This is why
Finca Conciencia started with already more than 20 boxes that need fixing and
revamping. Ana Elisa has been working with community gardens since she was very
young and constantly found formerly incarcerated men, women and families that
couldn't find jobs because of their criminal record. Proyecto Las Abejas is for
everyone; we don't look at your criminal record but at your work ethic.
Proyecto Las Abejas (The Bee Project) trains future farmers in and out of a
diversity of correctional institutions and their families. Certifying
participants as Sustainable Agriculture Promoters and providing a space for the
formerly incarcerated and families to develop, produce and educate about
sustainable agriculture as an alternative socioeconomic model. Empowering and
supporting inmates, formerly incarcerated, and families in underserved
communities to grow healthy food, expanding employment opportunities and
bringing us closer to food sovereignty in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Also we want to give AFRICANIZED BEES AN OPPORTUNITY. These
bees could save the world and they are special in Vieques, producing tasty,
dark, fruity honey at great speed! </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442196468/vwysultfhthg0ban92v5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u>Why do we need your help? Our goal</u></b></p>
<p>We need $45,000 to sustain and make viable this project but
we are asking for $15,000, with $15,000 we would be able to provide a healthy
base for our work and search for new materials. We need to revamp our apiary
with new boxes fit for africanized bees like the ones we have in Vieques. Your

Con tu
apoyo podemos re-estructurar y expandir el apiario, proveerle trabajo a ex-convictos
y familiares a través de la apicultura y educar sobre las abejas! 

Nuestra
miel viene de abejas africanizadas que se reproducen mucho
más rápido y necesitan unas cajas especializadas. Nuestras colmenas están
libres de químicos, antibióticos y son hogar de abejas que recorren la isla!
El sábado, 29 de agosto comenzamos un curso para trabajar con
abejas que se dará todos los sábados consecutivos hasta el 24 de octubre. Nos
interesa que la agricultura pueda ser un trabajo para el pueblo. 
Por
lo que hemos desarrollado tres cursos para formar Promotores de Agroecología
Bieke (2013-2015). La formación de promotores se basa en la metodología
campesino a campesino que busca entrenar de manera horizontal partiendo del
conocimiento agrícola que tengamos y requiere de un compromiso entre los que
luego pasan a ser promotores de agroecología, con seguir practicando la
agricultura y enseñando sobre la misma.
El
primer curso se ofreció en el huerto comunitario de la Esperanza que Ique,
Miguelina, Hilda y Elías llevan trabajando por unos años. El curso facilitó la
expansión del huerto y la organización del mismo a lo que hoy día llamamos
Finca Comunitaria Sembrando Esperanza en la Esperanza. El segundo vino siendo
un intercambio entre huertos comunitarios e interesados con el Huerto
Comunitario de César Coca y el Huerto Comunitario de Lucila Franco. Hace dos
meses culminamos el curso para promotores en la Finca Conciencia en Monte
Carmelo.
El
Proyecto Las Abejas busca capacitar y adiestrar a confinados, ex-confinados y
familiares mediante la producción agroecológica, la preparación de promotores
agroecológicos, y la promoción de la justicia social y ambiental. Empoderando y
apoyando a confinados, ex confinados y familiares para crecer, mercadear y
educar sobre alimentos sanos, ampliando las oportunidades de empleo y
acercándonos a la soberanía alimentaria en el archipiélago de Puerto Rico. A su
vez reducimos riesgos, aumentamos la sustentabilidad y resiliencia en comunidad
y proveemos seguridad alimentaria. Como las abejas entendemos que podemos
organizarnos, y trabajar duro entre todos para una mejor convivencia. 
Sobre las abejas
Las
abejas son vitales para que nos alimentamos, ya que son las encargadas
principales de transportar el polen para fecundar los óvulos de las flores. Lo
que se le llama polinización. Sin ellas todos los árboles con flores, que dan
frutas dejarían a la larga de reproducirse, causando un desastre alimentario
mundial. 1/3 parte de la comida que consumimos los humanos depende de las
abejas. 3/4 partes de las plantas del planeta dependen de la polinización para
reproducirse, y las abejas son cruciales para que esto sea así. 1
colmena poliniza 3 millones de flores por día. Una colmena es una comunidad
organizada de abejas que vive en una caja preparada. La reina pone hasta 2
millones de huevos en su vida productiva y en una colmena de 30,000 abejas
existen 100 zánganos, el resto son trabajadoras. Los zánganos no tienen
aguijones, solo están para aparearse. La próxima vez que le digas zángano a
alguien piensa en las abejas. 
Para
comer las quenepas, aguacates, cacao (de donde proviene el chocolate), limón,
naranja y tomarnos ese rico café necesitamos a las abejas. En Estados Unidos
los agricultores buscan desesperadamente a los apicultores para polinizar las
grandes extensiones de almendros de California, donde se estima que son
necesarias más de un millón de colmenas cada año. En Florida pasa otro tanto
con los cítricos, ya que tienen muy claro que las abejas pueden mejorar hasta
un 60% la producción cada año.
Una colonia completa de abejas se enferma y muere en
un periodo de dos semanas. Hasta el momento, cerca de la mitad de las abejas en
Europa y Estados Unidos han desaparecido repentinamente de esa forma, y los
científicos conocen este fenómeno como el Problema de Colapso de Colonias (CCD,
por sus siglas en inglés). (Suzanna Engman, Revista de Investigación Inventio) Las
causas mayores por su muerte son la agricultura industrial, la pérdida de
hábitat y los pesticidas tóxicos. Todo esto hace que las abejas se debiliten y
mueran rápidamente y las ha hecho mucho más susceptibles a enfermedades y
plagas. Entre estas se encuentra un ácaro sanguijuela que se les pega y trata
de chupar su sangre y la de sus larvas. Este ácaro se llama varroa. Aunque es
más pequeño que los puntos en esta oración, para una abeja es grande,
vendría siendo como del tamaño de un gato para nosotros. Este ácaro se adhiere
a la abeja y le crea heridas abiertas que las dejan más susceptibles a
infecciones. Las abejas africanizadas han mostrado ser mucho más resistentes a
la varroa, ya que pelean por sus vidas intentando eliminarlo. Aquí estamos
hablando de abejas Apis mellifera, la abeja relacionada a la miel y de Apis
mellifera europea y africanizadas. Por eso apostamos a la agricultura ecológica
y a la inclusión de abejas africanizadas en nuestros apiarios. Es lo único que
puede cambiar el estado actual de las abejas. 
Sobre las abejas
africanizadas en Vieques 
En
Puerto Rico y en muchos países no quieren a las abejas africanizadas, ni
siquiera se quiere hacer mención de ellas por su fama de asesinas. Sin embargo
esta abeja está establecida en Puerto Rico desde los años 80, no se sabe bien
los cruces que ha generado pero se entiende que es menos agresiva que en muchos
países del mundo. En el 2005 cuando las abejas melíferas del mundo empiezan a
tener trastornos, comienzan las investigaciones en laboratorios en Europa y
Estados Unidos para ver como se podía bajar la agresividad en las abejas
africanizadas. Estas investigaciones se dan desde grandes laboratorios, pero ya
en Vieques se han observado cruces con las abejas africanizadas y en la
práctica se ha hecho mucho trabajo con ellas. La propuesta entonces es
establecer apiarios africanizados en Vieques que a su vez sirven como una
especie de laboratorio. Jorge Cora lleva investigando las abejas africanizadas
desde el 1996 y a través de un curso que tomó de apicultura en el 2005 comienza
a hablar sobre la africanización y hacer pruebas con cera estampada. Las abejas
europeas ponen 2,000 huevos diarios, mientras que las abejas africanizadas ponen
4,000 huevos diarios. Además la abeja africanizada Apis mellifera nace dos días antes a la europea Apis mellifera, son más pequeñas pero
son más veloces y visitan mayor cantidad de flores. Son más defensivas, pero
esto no significa tengan ningún interés en picarte así por que sí, van a
proteger su colmena con más tenacidad de depredadores. Por lo tanto con estas
ventajas, hay que darle la oportunidad a las abejas africanizadas. Darle la
oportunidad a las abejas africanizadas salvaría el mundo, es vital no temerle a
las abejas de esta especie.
Sobre Finca Conciencia:
En
Puerto Rico se importa más del 85% de lo que se consume, en Vieques la cifra es
aún mayor. Actualmente la seguridad alimentaria en Vieques es una precaria, por
lo que nos hemos dado a la tarea de facilitar la producción, distribución y
comercialización de la agricultura local. La familia promedio come productos
enlatados a diario, que además de tomar el ferry toman buques, aviones y
camiones tardándose semanas para llegar a nuestra mesa. Si en Puerto Rico
ocurriese una crisis en los puertos habría comida para tan solo cuatro días,
¿qué pasaría en Vieques?
La
Finca Conciencia comenzó hace ocho años con la preocupación del agricultor
Jorge Cora de producir lo que comía y para el pueblo. La finca se ha
desarrollado a pico y pala por los últimos años, sin maquinaria ni insumos
tóxicos como los pesticidas y herbicidas. Actualmente sirve como una especie de
finca escuela. En los últimos meses hemos celebrado una Finca Abierta, visitas
guiadas a escuelas y jóvenes, días de brigadas de trabajo, un cine foro con la
coordinadora de una escuela de formación del Movimiento de los Sin Tierra en
Brasil (gracias a la Organización de Agricultura Ecológica Boricuá), talleres
sobre abejas y apicultura y un curso para promotores de agroecología Bieké.
Gracias a los estudiantes de la Escuela 20 de Septiembre y la maestra Elda
Guadalupe hemos organizado un banco de semillas de las semillas locales
viequenses.

<p>I believe that if you create a people powered, content creation platform, that it will develop organically to build trust and make it simple for anyone to grow social and business relationships, sell their products and services to increase influence, develop social proof and to generate more sales for people, brands and stores. <br/></p>
<p>Most large social networks (Pinterest, Facebook, etc) don't have full commerce features yet. With a successful campaign, I can launch the site in beta in 2-3 months and allow people to use it for feedback and to improve the user experience.</p>

</div></div>","Hello My name is Nancy, and I’m an Entrepreneur. Sure, I'm a lot of other things too. I work as a social media manager, internet marketer, web developer and social networking host... but I'm also a self-employed, stay at home, mom. I have two amazing children, my greatest achievement thus far.PassionI’ve always had a desire to dream big and do big things. I’ve always had a desire and passion to push myself beyond the limits and create my own non-limits. I don't just wish, I do. I enjoy achieving goals. I like working hard. I like working smart.But, it's not really work when you love what you do. ProjectWhat is this campaign for? I need funding to finish development on a website:Hang it! The Social Commerce Network
This new Social Network and Social Commerce platform has the winning features of today's top visited social media websites. It's like Facebook + Pinterest + Instagram + Etsy + Amazon = all in one place!
It'll save people time by using fewer networks to curate & create content, discover interests, organize digital media, engage with community, share products and services and to follow inspiring ideas, trends, brands and people.



I believe that if you create a people powered, content creation platform, that it will develop organically to build trust and make it simple for anyone to grow social and business relationships, sell their products and services to increase influence, develop social proof and to generate more sales for people, brands and stores. 
Most large social networks (Pinterest, Facebook, etc) don't have full commerce features yet. With a successful campaign, I can launch the site in beta in 2-3 months and allow people to use it for feedback and to improve the user experience.
 Here's a video about the technology of -- The Social Commerce Network:I’d love it, if you would, allow me to tell you about a project that I’ve been working on, for the last, 3 and a half years. I know that sounds like a LONG time to develop a “product” but, this happens to be a complex web platform - built from scratch. It was also expensive, paying for it, on my own, but, I have. :)Inspiration came by wanting to combine the visually interesting and hot new social media site, Pinterest, with the buy/sell functionality of Etsy, because I could see the desire that some people appeared to have, while they were impulsively buying products on Etsy or purchasing items, off of Pinterest. The idea of being available at the moment when: visual inspiration, met with product discovery and resulted in spontaneous gratification, seemed necessary.I talked to developer after developer, only to decide that with every custom feature that I wanted and to have an exceptional cart and commerce software solution, that I had to develop the site, from scratch. I wanted an unlimited amount of buyers and sellers and stores - with personal and business profiles, so I had to try to create something unique that didn't exist already.I had this vision of a global social commerce site that could do everything all the top blockbuster social websites did, in one place. I wanted to facilitate the sale and trade of anything that can be bought and sold, across the web. I wanted it to be like eBay and Amazon, as well. It was time to make E-Commerce - Social and Fun!After some time and research, I wrote up exactly what the site needed, the programming types required and what functions were going to be necessary.Moving Forward3 years later - I'm on the 2nd phase of this social commerce and social curation network.  It was a lot of work and effort to get here. After endless hours of research and interviewing countless freelance developers, I finally got it launched, in Phase 1. (although private).It was challenging getting this developed because of work distance, costs, funds and lack of web development resources. (at the time of dev, around Sept, 2012).
Things have changed alot! Here is the current revenue for Social Commerce:

Social Commerce - is still in it's infancy. I want to make Hang it, truly SOCIAL.
Over the years, it's given me a few challenges and became discouraging at times, but I never stopped believing that I could build it. It became a creative and design challenge for me. I understood the vision and direction it needed, so I slowly guided it there. I feel invested in this project. Aside from time and a good amount of my own money, I'm just thrilled to finally see this concept become a reality!!This project has been with me through a few phases of my personal life. In the video below, I share my thoughts on the product, my prior and current work experience and a personal story about adversity and triumph and why launching this website and tech startup will be a dream come true for me.
          Campaign



I created a Crowdfunding Campaign, so that I can finish this product, Hang it! 


I’m seeking funding in the amount of: $20,000

Create Backend for Cart/Commerce
Update Design & Usability
Launch in Beta (invitation only)
Marketing & Optimization
Begin Phase 3 (mobile app)


I need your support to finish it, in this present phase.

Your contributions would help get it completed.How this product is different from the competition:Features



I need to raise more funds in this campaign to finish the site and launch it!



My goal is to complete Phase 2 and launch by Fall, to test out the e-commerce, curation and userability and to get valuable feedback from initial users.I feel passionate about watching it grow and I feel confident about getting it done.  If you've been overly enthused about something before, you get it. :)

<p>BuyAnyCoin is a natural creation from the demand of the cryptocurrency market. So, what are doing?

<p><i>Oh, sweet, </i>you think to yourself.  <i>This is awesome; I figured out how to get bitcoins a few months ago, but what a hassle!  This seems way easier - just grab the card and go.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>*     *     *</i></p>
<p>Yes - 'figuring out' how to <i>get</i> bitcoin (or any other digital currency) has been one of the biggest hurdles to get over for someone curious about the technology.  Even die-hard geeks that understand how amazing it is to be able to manage your finances with futuristic tools and applications have had difficulty cobbling together a good plan to get started.  But these are just temporary problems; the internet made this technology possible, and now it is going to make it <i>REAL</i>.</p>
<p>There's no reason you shouldn't have the power and speed of digital currency at your fingertips while stopping at the gas station to buy a beverage.   With BuyAnyCoin's marketing strategy, the average individual is finally given direct <i>physical access</i> to a <i>virtual product</i>. This is the best gateway to adoption, giving the customer something they already know and connecting it to something they want to use; digital currency!</p>
<p>Digital currency is moving from the high-tech space to public relevance, and BuyAnyCoin is here to accelerate that transition by both understanding and appealing to <i>real people.  </i>Instead of asking them to change their habits to try something new, we're aligning with their existing habits and legitimizing the next generation of financial technology - literally <i>before their very eyes.</i></p>
<p>Our company is not a bet on the success of Bitcoin alone, but rather an investment in the millions of people and billions of man-hours already spent building this unprecedented new industry which <i>already </i>blows the competition away.  Digital financial tech is ready to be put in the hands of the everyday consumer!</p>

<p>Many founders around
the world are working on the same problems and solutions in isolation, and lack
a way to communicate with other relevant startups teams. Startups often fail due
to a lack of communication and an inability to connect to critical resources. StartupBlink
bridges this gap.</p><p>Here are our numbers so far:</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447749864/avg4shkeh62eu4w24h5q.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><a href=""http://startupblink.com/?utm_source=indiegogocampaign&amp;utm_medium=indiegogo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">StartupBlink</a> also aims
to help global startups gain traction and receive valuable feedback. Startups
from traditional ""startup hubs"" such as San Francisco and London have
a much better chance of receiving favorable press, acquiring investment, finding
mentors, and hiring high quality team members than startups in developing
countries. By building a global platform, <a href=""http://startupblink.com/?utm_source=indiegogocampaign&amp;utm_medium=indiegogo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">StartupBlink</a> will narrow this gap and
create an open channel of communication between startup founders around the
world. </p>

<p>1) An <b>Investor section</b>
that will allow startups to pitch directly to investors. </p>
<p>2) A <b>Resources section</b>
with startup resources filtered by location and subject.</p>
<p>3) An <b>Events section</b>
which will filter relevant startup events by dates and locations.</p>
<p>We will continue to
work on a new feature that will allow everyone to create their own individual startup
map. These maps can be customized and embedded easily in any website. </p>
<p>We will create
hundreds of active startup meetups around the world, and will focus on helping
local startup ecosystems grow in developing countries.</p>
<p>We will greatly

What is StartupBlink?
StartupBlink  is a massive global map connecting the startup ecosystem with the information and resources necessary for
success. The project includes tens of thousands of startups, coworking spaces, accelerators, startup organizations, tech reporters, influencers and much more. StartupBlink and its team were featured in dozens of magazines including Forbes, TNW and CNN.All around the world
new startups appear every day, representing a universal and collective human drive
to create innovative solutions for the problems we all face. 
However, the startup
ecosystem lacks a globally organized meeting, information, and resource nexus for
all its active members.That is exactly what we are building, and need your help to complete it.  


We officially launched
the StartupBlink global startup map in October 2014. Since then, thousands of startups,
coworking spaces and accelerators have registered on our platform.
To date, StartupBlink has appeared in dozens of
magazines, including Forbes,
CNN, and Business Insider. You can view all articles in our blog. 
Even Guy Kawasaki
thinks StartupBlink is a cool project.We agree! The project
is cool, but we want to take the platform a step further. Currently,
StartupBlink offers a graphic display of each local startup hub, and allows
thousands of startups, coworking spaces, accelerators, tech reporters and similar
organizations to add themselves to the map.
We also allow users to
filter these thousands of entities by industry and location, and the entities can share their milestones and news on the map by Blinking.
Seeing thousands of
Blinks from startups around the world is exciting, and shows the potential of the
platform to become an invaluable communication tool for the global startup

founders improve the survival rate of their startups and achieve growth by
connecting them with relevant information and resources.

only become a global resource for the startup ecosystem, but it will hopefully
help to change the way startup founders are able to communicate with each other.
Many founders around
the world are working on the same problems and solutions in isolation, and lack
a way to communicate with other relevant startups teams. Startups often fail due
to a lack of communication and an inability to connect to critical resources. StartupBlink
bridges this gap.Here are our numbers so far:
StartupBlink also aims
to help global startups gain traction and receive valuable feedback. Startups
from traditional ""startup hubs"" such as San Francisco and London have
a much better chance of receiving favorable press, acquiring investment, finding
mentors, and hiring high quality team members than startups in developing
countries. By building a global platform, StartupBlink will narrow this gap and
create an open channel of communication between startup founders around the
world. 

We want to keep the
platform open and free for all startups while continuing to add features and
functionality geared toward entrepreneurs. 
If you’re reading
this, you’re probably interested in helping the startup ecosystem grow, and you
want to support innovation and entrepreneurship. Our team has worked for over a
year with limited resources to build the current platform. Now we turn to you
with the existing model as a proof to our commitment to this project, and we ask
for your support to help us continue making the platform better and more
interactive. 
We are confident that
if we have your help, StartupBlink will truly be the world’s first global startup
ecosystem hub.

One of the most
exciting developments we have had so far is the voluntary participation of
dozens of Ambassadors from around the world in developing the map. For us, the
ambassadors are committed local startup leaders who want to push their startup
ecosystems to the next level. 

StartupBlink is also making
connections between entrepreneurs offline. We are working hard on establishing
hundreds of meetups around the world with the help of our ambassadors. Your
support will help us accelerate the facilitation of these global meetups.


In addition to startups
companies, StartupBlink connects many other assets within the global startup
ecosystem. We are big fans of the coworking concept, and we are proud to have
more than 700 coworking spaces registered on the map.
As well as coworking
spaces, hundreds of accelerators and startup-related organizations are also registered
on the map. We have even added a startup reporters section where startups can share
their story and receive press coverage in their relevant industries.
Even more, we’re mapping
global startup Influencers from around the world - startup leaders with proven
track records in the local startup ecosystem who act as both sources of
inspiration and potential mentors for entrepreneurs. We will soon add more new
areas to the platform, including sections for investors, startup resources, and
startup events, each with integrated search filters.  The Founders of StartupBlink are Roderick Warren, an American-Swiss entrepreneur, and Eli David, an Israeli entrepreneur.  Both Eli and Roderick are startup fanatics, constantly working on their own startups while mentoring others and participating in startup events around the world. Just like our startups, our life stories are far from ordinary. Eli had a normal life as an accountant working for firms such as BDO and KPMG, and then 5 years ago decided to become a digital nomad, constantly changing locations every month or so (Eli's Nomadic blog can be seen Here). Roderick was a Specialist in Fire Protection and Emergency Management in conflict zones such as Iraq and Kosovo before pivoting to become a startup founder.  We are fortunate to have with us an amazing team from all over the world helping us developing our site and community:

Your money will make StartupBlink
truly interactive. 
The current platform provides a wealth of information in an intuitive interface,
but doesn't support interaction and communication between startups as well as
it could. We would like to build up features that support interaction within
the site and further develop the ideas of Blinking your milestones and
connecting you to relevant resources customized to your needs.  We are now working on
building an extension to the site that will allow your project to receive
feedback and reviews from the StartupBlink community, giving you valuable insight
into things you should consider changing,
We will also add 3 new
sections to the map:
1) An Investor section
that will allow startups to pitch directly to investors. 
2) A Resources section
with startup resources filtered by location and subject.
3) An Events section
which will filter relevant startup events by dates and locations.
We will continue to
work on a new feature that will allow everyone to create their own individual startup
map. These maps can be customized and embedded easily in any website. 
We will create
hundreds of active startup meetups around the world, and will focus on helping
local startup ecosystems grow in developing countries.
We will greatly
improve the amount of data available within the platform and create a startup
information hub for each local startup ecosystem, updated in real time.
In order to accomplish
all our plans, $30K is the bare minimum. However, $100K would allow us to continue
improving the platform well into 2016. Our list of Perks is
quite varied! First and foremost, the biggest perk is knowing that by
supporting us, you are supporting the global startup ecosystem itself. Your
funding will help the StartupBlink platform become more valuable to users and
founders, and we all thank you for that. 
In addition, we have
some practical perks that will help your startup or organization grow and gain
traction. 
You can become a
sponsor on our global sponsor map:You can also appear as
a sponsor in your local meetup group:Have a “Check It Out” Box pointing to your project appear at the left corner of the screen every time someone zooms into your city:

We have perks to
feature your startup on our Newsletter and Social media, consutling perks to help you get advice and build your executive summary or marketing plan, and much more.
Simply pick the one
most relevant perk to you, and help us grow the global startup community!

Every perk purchased supplies us with oxygen to keep on working on this great platform. Help us spread the
word about StartupBlink and encourage other startups, coworking spaces and accelerators
to add themselves to the StartupBlink map.  
Follow StartupBlink on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Linkedin, Newsletter You can also join one of our Meetups
We can't wait to see
you on the StartupBlink map!

But if you click on the link provided in my campaign, you will be led to my website- which will provide you with the images of both my book cover and my logo (which I have designed myself.)</div>
<div>     My pen name is Queen Dreama; a character I have created for children of all ages to advocate the importance of following your heart's dream. To realize and believe in your heart's dream is the beginning of discovering who you are, who you were created to be, and why you are here.</div>
<div>     The Arbor Day Foundation has partnered with me in promoting the preservation of our trees through the current WestBow Press release of my first young reader's book: ""The Magic Toy Tree."" </div>
<div>     My book is the first in a series of seven which advocates family, the love of children, and the ""magic"" of God's miracles- one of which is our ""living treasures: trees."" My ultimate goal is to grow the humble beginnings of my own business in order that I may help to feed the hungry in a very special way. </div>
<div>      Will you help me provide seeds, tools, flyers and plots of earth in order that both children and parents will learn how to save seeds, to grow their own healthy, organic food and how to preserve it? A meal feeds only once: a good, healthy garden feeds; forever.</div>
<div>     I am seeking an overall campaign goal of $5,000.00 in order to establish ""Queen Dreama Enterprises;"" my own multi-faceted business. I am qualified and prepared to become successful enough to make a difference in the lives of many of our forgotten/ignored hungry and hurting children. Though I have managed to publish my book, create my first website and outline the courses I will be offering in the near future, I lack the remaining required ""seed money"" to make this dream come true. Without the proper book launch, waiting for enough royalties from my publisher (which is how my book sales are currently set up) to take my business to the next level will take ""forever."" Hurting, innocent children experience ""forever"" each day that they suffer with hunger. </div>
<div>     My business expenses thus far have prevented me from taking the next important step to succeed. I need to be able to buy inventory and to launch and market my book in the manner in which I have studied for the past five years. The sooner I can put my marketing skills into place the sooner I will reach my ultimate goal of being able to give back via feeding our hungry children and helping children of all ages to believe in themselves and the power of making your heart's dream come true. I am preparing life-courses based upon my life-experience and my college education which will also promote and expedite my ultimate goal.</div>
<div>     If I reach my campaign goal of $5,000.00 and am able to purchase my own inventory and properly launch my first book, for each $20.00 donation I will send you a signed, first-edition copy of ""The Magic Toy Tree"" as a remembrance of your selfless part in feeding hungry children and helping to promote the preservation of our trees. (Information on joining The Arbor Day Foundation is in my book.) I will keep your donations on file, and for each additional $20.00 donation increment, I will also send you a signed, first-edition copy of the upcoming books in the series. ($20.00; I will send a signed copy of ""The Magic Toy Tree"", $40.00; I will also send you a signed copy of the second book in the series ""The Wishing Tree"", $60.00; I will also send you a signed copy of the next two books in the series- and so on. You may acquire an entire first-edition collection of these very special books. For contributions of $100.00 or more, you will also receive a free e-book stub; downloadable on any ""readable"" device. Future editions of this and my other books in the series will be in color format.</div>
<div>     All funds received, whether I reach my campaign goal or not, will go toward my ultimate goal while simultaneously promoting the Arbor Day Foundation; both in my book and in my public speaking engagements. </div>
<div>     We all know that life can be unkind. I have known many disappointments. I have known the loss of everything. I have known hunger; and I know that of all the dragons we must fight in this world- hunger is the most terrible. But as they say, ""You cannot kill one who has dreamed a dream like mine."" That is why I began from ""ground-zero"", and in my fifties- picked myself up, educated myself and determined that I would do everything in my power to help as many children as possible to be freed from the indescribable pain and horror of hunger. A meal only feeds once. A good, healthy garden feeds forever. </div>
<div>     That-is my heart's dream. Now, at 60- the realization of that dream is within my reach- with your love and help.</div>
<div>     I realize that not everyone can contribute. But won't you share this campaign with others in order to help me reach my goal? I know that if I am able to purchase my own inventory and use it as a spring-board for my business, that within the next twelve months we will see the fruit of our labors become a beautiful reality. I will share the good news with you. And even though each child helped may not be able to personally say ""thank you;"" you will know in your heart that you have done a sacred, beautiful thing. </div>
<div>     If you should ever forget just how important your contribution is- just go to your library and take out your copy(ies) of ""The Magic Toy Tree"" series and read your inscription again. Share it with the children in your life, and remember how good love feels. </div><div>God's Love to You;</div><div>Queen Dreama</div></div>","Greetings!

That is why I began from ""ground-zero"", and in my fifties- picked myself up, educated myself and determined that I would do everything in my power to help as many children as possible to be freed from the indescribable pain and horror of hunger. A meal only feeds once. A good, healthy garden feeds forever. 
     That-is my heart's dream. Now, at 60- the realization of that dream is within my reach- with your love and help.
     I realize that not everyone can contribute. But won't you share this campaign with others in order to help me reach my goal? I know that if I am able to purchase my own inventory and use it as a spring-board for my business, that within the next twelve months we will see the fruit of our labors become a beautiful reality. I will share the good news with you. And even though each child helped may not be able to personally say ""thank you;"" you will know in your heart that you have done a sacred, beautiful thing. 
     If you should ever forget just how important your contribution is- just go to your library and take out your copy(ies) of ""The Magic Toy Tree"" series and read your inscription again. Share it with the children in your life, and remember how good love feels. God's Love to You;Queen Dreama",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><h3> Highlander's  New Brewery  and School</h3><p>About three years ago, shortly after Highlander Brew Co began production in South River,  the new highway through Northern Ontario was rerouted past the village.  During that time Highlander Brew Co has grown by distributing beer throughout Ontario. We have added a few fermenter tanks to the original brewery and have outgrown the small rented space we currently share with another local business. However the rest of the community has not grown. Rather than move away, Highlander with the support of the local and regional community will create a destination brewery that would encourage tourism in the area and provide a focal point for music, art and social events.  The new brewery will also become a  brewer technician school in association with a local college. The village has secured funding for a new building to house the new brewery destination. Now with some help from you we can complete the project .</p><h3>The School at Highlander Brew Co </h3><p> With the support  of other craft breweries in Ontario along  with the local community college Highlander will establish a brewer technician school within the brewery itself.  It will be a practical apprenticeship  program. The program will be available at minimal cost that will help  graduates find a rewarding  job immediately after the  6 month program is complete. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FqEIn-hdpljQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqEIn-hdpljQ&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FqEIn-hdpljQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p></p><h3>

<p></p>
<p><b>These four beer come in three packaging options:</b></p><ul>
<li>Single 750ml bottle - $20 </li>
<li>Case (12 bottles) - $200</li>
<li>Distributor pack (10 Cases) - $1,700</li>
</ul>
<strong><p><br/></p></strong><p><b>Spring</b></p>
<p>This English Style IPA like you never had before is based on Chinook, Centennial and Cascade hops with 2 Row crystal malt. Spring is in every sip and the soft Labrador tea and wintergreen flavour wakes your senses to the new spring . With a slight bite at IBU 40 and a 6.0 % alcohol, this is a refreshing and invigorating experience. Think of the rush of scent while walking through a forest in spring!</p>
<p><b>
</b></p><p><b><strong>Summer</strong></b></p><b>
</b><p>A
rollicking good time. Aged in Tequila barrels this beer has a light honey
colour. Additional flavour comes from the prickly pear, lime rinds, and
Himalayan mountain salt. For this full flavoured summer beer we use Flaked rye,
Maris malt and other German wheat malt. ABV 5.4 and IBU 30 –
A well balanced summer beer.</p>
<p><strong>Autumn</strong></p>
<p>Fall is
an English Nut Brown style of ale that uses apple wood smoked beached hazelnut
which grows wild at the brewery near Algonquin Park. The use of Maris malt
gives the beer a rich profile. Our friend M. Rheault  who makes a fantastic
whiskey has provided the oak chips and whiskey barrels for aging, which provide
the deep flavoured whiskey scent to the beer.. ABV 5.4 with IBU 38. Depth with
a slight bite but great balance.</p>
<p><strong>Winter</strong> </p>
<p>Winter
will be a comfort beer. Intense profound flavours deriving from locally
produced organic honey, along with subtle amounts of cinnamon, ginger and
orange zest to remind you of all the warmth and comfort of winter evenings
snuggling around the fireplace. It will be 8% ABV and low IBU of 32 to keep it
smooth and balanced. Picture the sleigh ride across the snowy fields and coming
home to a full rich balanced beer.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>When you visit the brewery</h3><p>You can stay nearby with our friends at Northern Edge Algonquin.  This is a multi cabin resort where you can experience the best the outdoors has to offer with all the comforts of home as well as a chef. Northern Edge has selected  a newly renovated 100 year old cabin to be named    "" Highlander House"". They have also offered special discounts to friends of Highlander Brew Co who wish to stay there.</p><p>A beautiful place to stay in any season.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1386288/files/20150415134654-HighlanderHouseCardFront.jpg?1429130814"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p>
<h3>Delivery</h3><p>We prefer you come to the new brewery and pick up your beer.  For those of you that make it to our brewery to pick up your reward we will give you $10 off anything in our retail store.   There is a variety of beer regulations in North America and this will determine when and how we ship to you. Rather than list all these programs here we will advise you  individually how we will ship the beer if you or your proxy cannot pick it up at the brewery. </p><p>

We have added a few fermenter tanks to the original brewery and have outgrown the small rented space we currently share with another local business. However the rest of the community has not grown. Rather than move away, Highlander with the support of the local and regional community will create a destination brewery that would encourage tourism in the area and provide a focal point for music, art and social events.  The new brewery will also become a  brewer technician school in association with a local college. The village has secured funding for a new building to house the new brewery destination. Now with some help from you we can complete the project .The School at Highlander Brew Co  With the support  of other craft breweries in Ontario along  with the local community college Highlander will establish a brewer technician school within the brewery itself.  It will be a practical apprenticeship  program. The program will be available at minimal cost that will help  graduates find a rewarding  job immediately after the  6 month program is complete. 

The Highlander Music Room 


The  brewery has always held musical events  that showcased local artists. This draws the community together and makes it attractive to visitors. We want to expand this activity and the new building being provided by the village will allow us to do that. 






Your  contribution will help us equip the event centre (light, sound, and furniture) and the technical school (lab  equipment,materials etc.  ) . It will also help Highlander expand its marketing program to make the whole project  sustainable for the long term. We have some good stuff for you Like you we have worked hard for what we have.  In return for your hard earned money we are offering excellent rewards including four premium exotic beers. 
In addition to any reward listed you will get:
• An ofﬁcial Highlander Board of Advisors certificate 
• $10 off your next visit to the Highlander retail store.Whether you contribute or not, you are always welcome at Highlander brewery where there is a cold one waiting for you.The Four Special Beers We are Making for You These four unique beers in special 750ml bottles are our special thank you.

These four beer come in three packaging options:
Single 750ml bottle - $20 
Case (12 bottles) - $200
Distributor pack (10 Cases) - $1,700

Spring
This English Style IPA like you never had before is based on Chinook, Centennial and Cascade hops with 2 Row crystal malt. Spring is in every sip and the soft Labrador tea and wintergreen flavour wakes your senses to the new spring . With a slight bite at IBU 40 and a 6.0 % alcohol, this is a refreshing and invigorating experience. Think of the rush of scent while walking through a forest in spring!

Summer
A
rollicking good time. Aged in Tequila barrels this beer has a light honey
colour. Additional flavour comes from the prickly pear, lime rinds, and
Himalayan mountain salt. For this full flavoured summer beer we use Flaked rye,
Maris malt and other German wheat malt. ABV 5.4 and IBU 30 –
A well balanced summer beer.
Autumn
Fall is
an English Nut Brown style of ale that uses apple wood smoked beached hazelnut
which grows wild at the brewery near Algonquin Park. The use of Maris malt
gives the beer a rich profile. Our friend M. Rheault  who makes a fantastic
whiskey has provided the oak chips and whiskey barrels for aging, which provide
the deep flavoured whiskey scent to the beer.. ABV 5.4 with IBU 38. Depth with
a slight bite but great balance.
Winter 
Winter
will be a comfort beer. Intense profound flavours deriving from locally
produced organic honey, along with subtle amounts of cinnamon, ginger and
orange zest to remind you of all the warmth and comfort of winter evenings
snuggling around the fireplace. It will be 8% ABV and low IBU of 32 to keep it
smooth and balanced. Picture the sleigh ride across the snowy fields and coming
home to a full rich balanced beer.
When you visit the breweryYou can stay nearby with our friends at Northern Edge Algonquin.  This is a multi cabin resort where you can experience the best the outdoors has to offer with all the comforts of home as well as a chef. Northern Edge has selected  a newly renovated 100 year old cabin to be named    "" Highlander House"". They have also offered special discounts to friends of Highlander Brew Co who wish to stay there.A beautiful place to stay in any season.
DeliveryWe prefer you come to the new brewery and pick up your beer.  For those of you that make it to our brewery to pick up your reward we will give you $10 off anything in our retail store.   There is a variety of beer regulations in North America and this will determine when and how we ship to you. Rather than list all these programs here we will advise you  individually how we will ship the beer if you or your proxy cannot pick it up at the brewery.

</div><p><b>The Indie Movement</b></p>
<p>The Indie Movement is an
independent business community that helps you identify and search for
privately-owned businesses wherever you are. </p>
<p>Smaller, locally-focused,
independent stores are the cornerstone of our communities and define what is
unique about us. Many of the seemingly private businesses in our neighborhoods are actually subsidiaries of much larger companies. Shopping at these
corporate investments and other chain stores drains money from our local
economies. As a result our communities are stripped of the jobs, the support, and
the character our families, friends, and neighbors worked so hard to create.</p>
<p>Our online business
directory and app will allow you to easily search for the independent
businesses in your community. Our logo and sticker will also help you identify
retailers, food vendors and service providers that are owned by the people closest to you.</p>
<p>Help us create a business
community in your area that is:</p>
<p><b>Privately Owned.</b></p>
<p>The majority of ownership
is either private, employee based, or part of a local cooperative. No portion
of the business is listed on a stock exchange.</p>
<p><b>Local.</b></p>
<p>The owner or majority of
owners live within the local community. The business does not have more than three separate shopfronts.</p>
<p><b>Self-Governed.</b></p>
<p>The decisions made regarding the business, including
branding and marketing, are completely controlled by the owner or majority of
owners. The business is not part of an external franchise. </p>
<p><b>Our Concept.</b></p>
<p>The Indie Movement is membership
based, affordable ($29 p.a.) and completely free of advertisement. Unlike other
online directories, all of our listings are based solely on proximity so potential
customers can locate the closest TIM businesses in their chosen category. There
is no opportunity for members to upgrade their listing or improve awareness within
the website so all registered businesses, regardless of revenue or size, are
treated equally. A sticker of our logo is also issued to each member so they are easily identifiable to passing foot traffic. Our emblem is designed to blend in with a diverse range of storefronts; it is available in many different colors so the individual appearance of each TIM member is not compromised.</p>
<p><b>Our Story.</b></p>
<p>Earlier this year I was
enjoying a meal at a local bar with some close friends. Several comments were
made about the unique style and ambiance of the hotel. With the intention of
complimenting the owner I conducted a quick Internet search and was
disappointed to find that the establishment was actually part of the Mitsubishi
Corporation. Profits from my meal were potentially headed for a group of executives halfway across the globe.</p>
<p>The following day I did a
little research about the ownership of other businesses I frequented; many of
those were also owned by multinational companies. My aim from that moment on was
to buy only from locally-owned stores; a feat much harder than first anticipated.

This is the perfect solution for new drivers to never form the habit of checking their phone while driving.Once installed in your vehicle, KRS is activated as soon as the vehicle is in gear and is deactivated when the vehicle is put in park and it's once again safe to check in.We are using the money from this campaign to create a large public awareness campaign to highlight the dangers of texting and driving, and how it affects thousands of families & communities across North America.KRS can be installed in any vehicle by one of our authorized dealers* and once installed it is highly unlikely that someone with general knowledge would be able to uninstall it, making it a much safer solution for your son or daughter than an app-based solution on their phone, which can easily be deactivated or deleted.How KRS Works:

<b>What is Kombucha?!</b><br/>
<p><b>Q. What is Kombucha?</b></p>
<p>A. Kombucha
cultures or SCOBY have been used traditionally for hundreds of years throughout
the world as a beneficial health drink and daily tonic. Kombucha
tea​(pronounced kom-boo-cha), also called a Manchurian mushroom, is a living
culture which grows on top of a mixture of brewed tea and sugar in which the
culture has been introduced.</p>
<p>Kombucha tea
is a healthy and refreshing fermented beverage that has been used for
generations. It is said to come from eastern Asia and now has traveled all
around the world.</p>
<p>Although it
is called a mushroom, it is not a mushroom at all as it does not produce spores
or ""fruit."" The ""mushroom"" or SCOBY can be describe as a
light brown or creamy white disk that grows on top of the liquid tea/sugar
mixture and will take the form of the container that it is in. Again, it is not
a mushroom at all, but really a yeast culture that has a symbiotic relationship
with various bacteria, which duplicates itself during each brewing cycle. The
correct name for the ""mushroom"" is a S.C.O.B.Y - a ​symbiotic culture
of bacteria and yeast. The culture may look fragile, however, it is really
thick and leathery in consistency. The finished brewed tea should be regarded
principally as a live food unusually rich in nutritive properties.</p>
<p><b>Q. What is unique about your kombucha?</b></p>
<p>A. <b>SOL Kombucha</b> is very unique but not a
new production concept. <b>SOL Kombucha</b>
contains only Raw Spring water from Michigan, it does not use municipal liquid,
“filtered” water, or ph recycled water. This is the very best water source in
Michigan. Raw, Living, Structured naturally with the greatest life force.</p>
<p>Besides the
best water, which is crucial for any brewing, Michigan herbs, fruits, and
suppliers are used to produce a truly local product made with care.</p>
<p><b>Q. What does kombucha taste like?</b></p>
<p>A. It tastes
somewhat like a sparkling apple cider with a tang of vinegar, depending on how
long it ferments. The flavor is also unique to the flavors <b>SOL Kombucha</b> offers.</p>
<p><b>Q. What can your Kombucha do for my health?</b></p>
<p>A. The
benefits to the physical body vary widely. As with yogurt or miso, the bacteria
and cultures in the tea are a great source of nutritional. Most common benefits
are it's detoxifying and metabolizing effects; aiding in metabolic function and
balance. It is also said to enhance the immune system, due to the organic acids
and antioxidants contained in the finished beverage. By detoxifying the body
and providing natural probiotics, it is unlikely for disease causing bacteria
and viruses to find a suitable growth environment.</p>
<p><b>Q. What flavors do you offer?</b></p>
<p>A. <b>SOL Kombucha</b> offers many flavors and
types of Kombucha.</p>
<p>Using a wide
range of teas from around the world, and even local coffee, we pride ourselves
on working with the season and adapting with the lunar calendar.</p>
<p><b>Q. What ingredients go into Kombucha?</b></p>
<p>A. Truly 4
Ingredients; Water, Tea, Sugar, and a Scoby.</p>
<p><b>Q. Does finished kombucha contain alcohol?</b></p>
<p>A. Yes, as
with all cultured and fermented foods, a small amount of naturally occurring
alcohol is typically present in the finished product. Although the amount will
vary from batch to batch, the amount should be quite small, if any (less than
0.05%).</p>
<p><b>Q. Why is using Raw Michigan spring water important to
SOL Kombucha?</b></p>
<p>A. I believe
that the true source of life comes from Raw Spring water gathered at the source.
It contains vital nutrients and life force that is more than any bottled water,
or filtered water can ever offer. It is genetically structured and is essential
for life.</p>
<p><b>Q. Explain the ‘milk-man’ discounted return system?</b></p>
<p>A. This
system is very simple, I like to reuse and communicate with people as much as
possible, so I am holding true to this. Once you purchase and return an empty <b>SOL Kombucha</b> bottle, you will receive a
discount on your next purchase. This is similar to returning empty plastic and
glass beer and soda bottles, but better because we wash and reuse the beautiful
amber flip top bottles.</p>
<p><b>Q. Where can I contact SOL Kombucha?</b></p>
<p>A. <b>SOL Kombucha</b> has a Facebook, website,
and soon to have an instagram and twitter page.
<a href=""http://www.Facebook.com/solkombucha"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.Facebook.com/solkombucha</a> is the best way to contact us.</p>

campaign; we are looking for support so we can bring the SOL to you. Here is
the link, and any donations at all would be greatly appreciated and help! This
campaign will help make <b>SOL Kombucha</b>
available throughout the local area.<br/><br/></p>
<p><b>Q. ​</b><b>What are the existing Kombucha products on the
market lacking? </b></p>
<p>A. I like to
try and see different kombucha on the market develop and first off, the more
the better! This means that people have the choice for the kombucha they want.
Friendly competition makes for a better product. <b>SOL Kombucha</b> is different from the other kombucha brands
predominantly because of the energy and love that goes into producing it. Using
the finest water, highest quality tea and proper flavor combinations as well as
the DIY aspect of the kombucha line and the integrity in the methods used.</p>
<p><b>Q: Why should I drink your kombucha over other Kombucha
brands?</b></p>
<p>A. <b>SOL Kombucha</b> is more than other Kombucha brands, in that it is
brewed in nano-batches, and only limited to a specific number of bottles, once
those are gone, its on to a new batch and flavor. What this does is promise the
best quality kombucha, with integrity, love and spirit that truly feeds your

<p>The
People's Clinic (“TPC”) is a community acupuncture clinic and a social business
that offers acupuncture on a sliding scale of $15-$40 per treatment.<span>  No income verification is required for these
rates; it is a pay what you can structure.  It’s been in operation since
2008 and is located in Boise, Idaho.</span></p>
<p><br/>
The owner of The People's Clinic, Donna Selle, was in an automobile accident
last summer and sustained a brain injury and was forced to close the clinic in
July 2014.  Donna has recovered nicely and the community needs and wants
The People's Clinic to reopen!  </p>
<p>The
People's Clinic has a unique business structure; it is a social business. 
Run very much like a non-profit, the primary reason a social business operates
isn’t to make a profit.  A social business creates something other than
profit that makes it valuable.  It builds community.  So, because TPC
is a social business, there isn't much money set aside.  A crowd funding
campaign that depends on the community is a perfect option for The People's
Clinic, a clinic that the community depends on.</p>
<p>In
its six years of operation, the clinic gave thousands of affordable acupuncture
treatments to ordinary people with ordinary incomes, thereby making acupuncture
a viable and affordable option for all.  TPC is a proud member of The
People's Organization of Community Acupuncture, (POCA), a nationwide co-op of
more than 250 acupuncture clinics plus countless patients, community members,
organizations, businesses and students all over the country (and in other
countries, too!) who believe that acupuncture should be available to all
people.<span>  Collectively, POCA member
clinics gave over ONE MILLION acupuncture treatments in 2014.  That means
there’s been over one million times pain has been relieved, anguish has been
erased and comfort has been achieved; one million tiny steps toward making this
world and the people who inhabit it just a little bit happier and healthier.<br/>
<br/>
Donna and The People’s Clinic were granted a microloan from POCA to get the
doors open again.  TPC is nearly there! 
What is needed is just a little bit more help.  Donna has found a
couple of great locations with lots of space and affordable rent (supremely
important so we can be sustainable and keep our fees LOW).  These
properties tend to be pretty ugly and shabby in their current condition. 
With your help we can add a fresh coat of paint and do a few other DIY projects
on the cheap and make TPC’s new space gorgeous.  <br/>
