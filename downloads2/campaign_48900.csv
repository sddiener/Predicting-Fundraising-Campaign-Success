</div></span><div>
<p>SmarterAlex are incredibly clever little devices – just slightly larger than a bar of soap – and are packed with the latest technology.<br/></p>
<p><b>SmarterAlex contains its own mobile phone modem so works entirely independently of WiFi or local internet connectivity and has an internal rechargeable battery so can continue to operate in case of power failure, making it perfect for commercial applications. </b><br/></p>SmarterAlex is a range of stand-alone units containing a number of different sensors. Different models are equipped with different sensors to address specific requirements or all sensors can be combined into a single unit. The range of sensors is ever increasing and currently consists of temperature, humidity, light, power failure, movement of the unit, movement in the vicinity, intruder camera and GPS. Temperature monitoring is further extended by a temperature probe which can be inserted inside a fridge/freezer or other location. </div><div><br/></div><div>

<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>SMALL &amp; MIGHTY</h2>
<div>
<p>The SmarterAlex monitor is housed in a simple minimalist white casing, just a touch larger than a bar of soap, which fits discreetly in to most situations. Extremely versatile, light to hold and can be fixed to a wall; a fridge; it can also operate whilst free standing and be carried in a case. </p>

<p><strong>Which box ?</strong></p>
<p>Because of its smart design, we have tailored to the specific needs of<br/>the customer by developing a range of units, each with a specific task.</p>
<p>There is of course a single unit which encapsulates all the sensors in<br/>one box if that is what your application demands!</p>
<p>There are four core units that operate to a specific task.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Driven by the Customer</strong></p>
<p>Too much technology is driven  without a thought for the end-user. Technology for  technology sake. At SmarterAlex, we have the heart of the customer in every decision we make. </p>
<p>So we are guided by three principles :</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/985039/files/20141104062640-SmarterSimplicity.jpg?1415111200"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ease of use, products shouldn’t be challenging or mystifying. You buy it, plug it in, it sets itself up and you’re up and running. Simple!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/985041/files/20141104062701-SmarterSmart.jpg?1415111221"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Technology should be intelligent and provide the services the customer actually wants. Not only that it should evolve but also have the ability to grow to accommodate future needs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/985043/files/20141104062716-SmarterControl.jpg?1415111236"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Technology should empower the user, giving them more control over their lives. As a result we have created a range of monitors to suit each individual needs as well as an ""all in one"" unit.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<h4>Light, Humidity, Temperature and Power.</h4>

</div></div>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>Monitors light, room temperature, humidity and power. We all want to try and be ‘a bit greener’ in our approach and this handy unit has been designed specifically to monitor light, humidity and temperature and the recorded data can be collated to provide a valuable source of information over specific periods of time and can show the interaction between the monitored functions .This monitoring can result in valuable cost savings.</p>
<p>Designed for use in greenhouses, homes, food tunnels, wine cellars, hydroponics, art galleries, museums and rooms containing environmentally sensitive equipment.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>TEMPERATURE</h2>
<h4>Temperature probe for fridges/freezers.</h4>
<p></p>

</div></div>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>Measures room temperature and also has a probe which can monitor the temperature of a fridge or freezer, it is ideal for:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The restaurant and cafe trade, hotel kitchens</li>
<li>Food retailers large and small</li>
<li>Alerting home owners someone has left the fridge freezer door open</li>
<li>Alerting holiday makers their fridge freezer is on the blink</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Specifically designed for monitoring locations where temperature is not only a critical factor but where for commercial reasons data has to be stored, analysed and collated for compliance purposes. A cabled thermocouple sensor (which can be placed in the actual fridge/freezer) is linked into the monitor that reports data back to the user.</p>

</div></div>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>Monitors motion using the built-in motion sensor and camera and optionally, with the Security + unit, includes a GPS (Global Positioning System). Not only can SmarterAlex alert you if it spots a potential intruder, it can also keep you updated of its own whereabouts if located in a bag/briefcase. Perfect anywhere where mobile or portable security is needed.</p>
<p>In addition a built-in camera will take a snapshot and send it straight to you if it detects movement, so you can see whether you need to take action or not. This function is great in homes, restaurants and cafes, museums, commercial premises, libraries, greenhouses.</p>
<p><b>Location Examples:</b> Place the monitor on a hotel bedroom wall and it can detect someone entering the room. Use it in your briefcase/hand bag and receive an alert if someone moves it. In both instances you will be notified immediately and it will also take a photo which can be down loaded giving the possibility of the intruder being captured on film. The Security+ version is also capable of being tracked using GPS so you can ascertain its location.</p>

<p>Monitored from your computer or mobile device, SmarterAlex informs you<br/>when a sensor triggers an alert<span>  - whether that is a temperature change which may indicate equipment failure, movement that could mean an potential intrusion or a power failure which stops equipment from working - SmarterAlex will instantly send a text, email or voice message notifying you of the event.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>SmarterAlex is very easy to set up. You sign up to an online account. Using a pre-bought SIM card or one supplied by us, you enter the telephone number and then switch on the unit to activate… it’s really as simple as that !</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/985090/files/20141104065620-Smarter6.jpg?1415112980"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>From that point on, whenever you log on to your online account you can immediately access the data your SmarterAlex is recording. You define the rules. You use the simple set-up screen that allows you to define what alerts you wish to receive and when they are to be sent. From that point on you can relax in the knowledge that RoomMonitor will be keeping a watchful eye 24/7 on those things important to you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>At any time you can adjust, switch on or off, any element of the monitoring using the online account or the mobile app to suit your needs. You’re in control.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Not being there doesn’t mean that you can’t respond when something is wrong. As soon as SmarterAlex senses an event outside your pre-set levels it will immediately inform you by SMS, Email or Voice Message. You choose how to respond. The SmarterAlex app will offer you suggestions such as 'escalate', 'remind', 'call a third party' or simply 'ignore'. You can even check in to make sure everything is OK, just for peace of mind. With the SmarterAlex room monitor you can do this virtually anywhere, from the other side of the globe, to the comfort of your bed. You’re always in control.</p>

<p><b>Is an internet connection required for SmarterAlex to work?</b></p>
<div><p>No – SmarterAlex is not dependent on your Internet connection because there is 2G/3G capability built-in which allows SmarterAlex to work independently. This is what differentiates SmarterAlex from other devices, it will keep you connected to what matters to you.</p></div>
<p><b>Is there a limit on the number of SmarterAlex that can be installed</b>?</p>
<div><p>Quite simply no! You can have as many as you wish, in the house, in the garden, in the garage. They are independent units.</p></div>
<p><b>Can I have more than one SmarterAlex on my account?</b></p>
<div><p>You can operate as many SmarterAlex as you wish from your main account. However you may want to divide the information into separate accounts which is not a problem.</p></div>
<p><b>Where can I put my SmarterAlex?</b></p>
<div><p>Because SmarterAlex is not dependent on WiFi you can put them pretty much anywhere (within reason!!) as long as there is a power socket handy.</p></div>
<p><b>Do I have to buy a SIM card from you, and is it easy to install?</b><br/></p>
<div>
<p>No you don’t. You can buy any type of SIM only card package, from any network. Just bear in mind that the data stream is continuous, so don’t forget to ‘Top-Up’ your data!

your chosen monitor by March of next year. Like the rest of the SmarterAlex set
up our manufacturers are UK
based and have been established for over 30 years with a proven track record of
excellence in the world of technology. To make this a cost effective production
we have to order a minimum number of monitors and with your help we know we can
meet that target figure. <br/>
<br/>
Current Progress: We already have fully functional prototype versions that are
up and running. SmarterAlex now has to move to the next and final development

WHAT'S SO SMART ABOUT SMARTERALEX ROOM MONITORS?

SmarterAlex are incredibly clever little devices – just slightly larger than a bar of soap – and are packed with the latest technology.
SmarterAlex contains its own mobile phone modem so works entirely independently of WiFi or local internet connectivity and has an internal rechargeable battery so can continue to operate in case of power failure, making it perfect for commercial applications. SmarterAlex is a range of stand-alone units containing a number of different sensors. Different models are equipped with different sensors to address specific requirements or all sensors can be combined into a single unit. The range of sensors is ever increasing and currently consists of temperature, humidity, light, power failure, movement of the unit, movement in the vicinity, intruder camera and GPS. Temperature monitoring is further extended by a temperature probe which can be inserted inside a fridge/freezer or other location. 




SMALL & MIGHTY

The SmarterAlex monitor is housed in a simple minimalist white casing, just a touch larger than a bar of soap, which fits discreetly in to most situations. Extremely versatile, light to hold and can be fixed to a wall; a fridge; it can also operate whilst free standing and be carried in a case. 


BEAUTIFULLY CONVENIENT



The SmarterAlex interface has been designed to work on all your devices, using either our custom built mobile app, or straight from the web. You can enjoy total control of your SmarterAlex monitor, where-ever you are.







WHAT CAN I USE MY SMARTERALEX ROOM MONITOR FOR?

Which box ?
Because of its smart design, we have tailored to the specific needs ofthe customer by developing a range of units, each with a specific task.
There is of course a single unit which encapsulates all the sensors inone box if that is what your application demands!
There are four core units that operate to a specific task.


Driven by the Customer
Too much technology is driven  without a thought for the end-user. Technology for  technology sake. At SmarterAlex, we have the heart of the customer in every decision we make. 
So we are guided by three principles :



Ease of use, products shouldn’t be challenging or mystifying. You buy it, plug it in, it sets itself up and you’re up and running. Simple!


Technology should be intelligent and provide the services the customer actually wants. Not only that it should evolve but also have the ability to grow to accommodate future needs.


Technology should empower the user, giving them more control over their lives. As a result we have created a range of monitors to suit each individual needs as well as an ""all in one"" unit.










ENVIRONMENT
Light, Humidity, Temperature and Power.







Monitors light, room temperature, humidity and power. We all want to try and be ‘a bit greener’ in our approach and this handy unit has been designed specifically to monitor light, humidity and temperature and the recorded data can be collated to provide a valuable source of information over specific periods of time and can show the interaction between the monitored functions .This monitoring can result in valuable cost savings.
Designed for use in greenhouses, homes, food tunnels, wine cellars, hydroponics, art galleries, museums and rooms containing environmentally sensitive equipment.



TEMPERATURE
Temperature probe for fridges/freezers.







Measures room temperature and also has a probe which can monitor the temperature of a fridge or freezer, it is ideal for:


The restaurant and cafe trade, hotel kitchens
Food retailers large and small
Alerting home owners someone has left the fridge freezer door open
Alerting holiday makers their fridge freezer is on the blink


Specifically designed for monitoring locations where temperature is not only a critical factor but where for commercial reasons data has to be stored, analysed and collated for compliance purposes. A cabled thermocouple sensor (which can be placed in the actual fridge/freezer) is linked into the monitor that reports data back to the user.








SECURITY / SECURITY +
Movement detector and movement camera.







Monitors motion using the built-in motion sensor and camera and optionally, with the Security + unit, includes a GPS (Global Positioning System). Not only can SmarterAlex alert you if it spots a potential intruder, it can also keep you updated of its own whereabouts if located in a bag/briefcase. Perfect anywhere where mobile or portable security is needed.
In addition a built-in camera will take a snapshot and send it straight to you if it detects movement, so you can see whether you need to take action or not. This function is great in homes, restaurants and cafes, museums, commercial premises, libraries, greenhouses.
Location Examples: Place the monitor on a hotel bedroom wall and it can detect someone entering the room. Use it in your briefcase/hand bag and receive an alert if someone moves it. In both instances you will be notified immediately and it will also take a photo which can be down loaded giving the possibility of the intruder being captured on film. The Security+ version is also capable of being tracked using GPS so you can ascertain its location.



ALL-IN-ONE
Environment. Temperature. Security +


The All-In-One incorporates all the features in the Environment, Temperature and Security Plus versions wrapped up in a single unit giving a substantial cost saving and provides you with a truly awesome monitor!



This unit provides a full monitoring procedure for whatever uses you have in mind. Utilising our unique cloud based services the data can be collated to your specific requirements.
Location Examples: This device can be located in both stationary and moving locations dependent on the tasks you need it to carry out. Its versatility allows you to carry it with you for motion protection and also to monitor temperature/humidity and light in a static location. Especially useful for travelers and those on the move. Also, it can be moved around the house to suit your different needs throughout the year. As an example: Winter time-monitor bedroom temperature and Summer time monitor greenhouse temperature, humidity and light. At night the motion sensor can monitor activity outside your bedroom door or in the hallway/back door.







HOW DO I SET MY SMARTERALEX UP?



Monitored from your computer or mobile device, SmarterAlex informs youwhen a sensor triggers an alert  - whether that is a temperature change which may indicate equipment failure, movement that could mean an potential intrusion or a power failure which stops equipment from working - SmarterAlex will instantly send a text, email or voice message notifying you of the event.

SmarterAlex is very easy to set up. You sign up to an online account. Using a pre-bought SIM card or one supplied by us, you enter the telephone number and then switch on the unit to activate… it’s really as simple as that !




From that point on, whenever you log on to your online account you can immediately access the data your SmarterAlex is recording. You define the rules. You use the simple set-up screen that allows you to define what alerts you wish to receive and when they are to be sent. From that point on you can relax in the knowledge that RoomMonitor will be keeping a watchful eye 24/7 on those things important to you.

At any time you can adjust, switch on or off, any element of the monitoring using the online account or the mobile app to suit your needs. You’re in control.

Not being there doesn’t mean that you can’t respond when something is wrong. As soon as SmarterAlex senses an event outside your pre-set levels it will immediately inform you by SMS, Email or Voice Message. You choose how to respond. The SmarterAlex app will offer you suggestions such as 'escalate', 'remind', 'call a third party' or simply 'ignore'. You can even check in to make sure everything is OK, just for peace of mind. With the SmarterAlex room monitor you can do this virtually anywhere, from the other side of the globe, to the comfort of your bed. You’re always in control.

What is Apson?

Apson is a web-site where you can customize, design and order individual bespoke shirts. This platform is the missing link to get you the shirt you always wanted: a shirt that is made specially for you – your individual design in your unique size. At the same time, you will feel good knowing that your shirt is not made in a sweatshop, but is tailored by small Thai enterprises.How does Apson work?Apson is the platform where you choose between different fabrics and assemble the different patterns (collar, cuffs, pockets, button tab, finishing, etc.) to your own design. Premium features will be available (fabric mix & match, premium buttons, etc.).We have several ways to take your measurements to make sure that the shirt will fit. You can choose a standard-size and alter the needed parts, you can use your own unique measurements according to our guide, or you can try our app to be measured via your webcam. In any case the shirt will be unique and perfectly made for you.

The power of the crowdEach great idea needs material support to get realized. Apson will be great from the start on: great in design, great in handling, great in experience. Therefore, an initial capital of €5.000 is needed to kickstart the process. To gather this initial capital, Shirt-Futures are on sale. Help kickstarting Apson, by getting one!





Shirt-Future?
Buy one of our Shirt-Futures and look forward to your first Apson shirt. As soon as Apson is ready to go, your unique shirt will wait for you at your doorstep. No extra costs, no hustle – just pure enjoyment over the quality from your piece of individuality.



Bulletproof
100 sold Shirt-Futures are the lower limit. If they are sold within 30 days, Apson is sufficiently founded and ready to go. In the unlikely case not enough will be sold in time, you get your money back. Indiegogo guarantees for that. No worries, no costs, no risk – but fun!

Was ist Apson?
Apson ist eine Website wo du individuelle Maßhemden gestalten, anpassen und bestellen kannst. Diese Webseite ist die Lösung um dir das Hemd zu bringen, das du schon immer wolltest: ein Hemd das nur für dich gemacht wurde – dein eigenes Design in deinen persönlichen Maßen. Gleichzeitig kannst du ein gutes Gewissen haben, da das Hemd nicht in einem »Sweatshop« gemacht wurde, sondern von kleinen Unternehmen in Thailand geschneidert wird.

Wie funktioniert Apson?
Auf der Webseite wählst du aus verschiedenen Stoffen aus und erstellst aus den unterschiedlichen Elementen (Kragen, Manschetten, Taschen, Knopfleisten, Abschluss, usw.) dein eigenes Design. Premium Features sind ebenfalls verfügbar (mix & match mit anderen Stoffen, Premium Knöpfe, usw.).
Wir haben verschiedene Methoden um deine Maße zu nehmen, um sicherzustellen, dass das Hemd passen wird. Du kannst eine passende Standardgröße wählen und die Feinheiten anpassen, du kannst deine eigenen Maße entsprechend unserer Anleitung verwenden oder du kannst dich mithilfe deiner Webcam und unserer App vermessen lassen.
In jedem Fall wird das Hemd einzigartig und perfekt für dich gemacht sein.


Die Macht der MengeJede große Idee bedarf der nötigen Mittel um Realität zu werden. Apson wird großartig von Anfang an: im Design, in der Bedienung und in der Abwicklung. Um die Entwicklung auf einem hohen Niveau zu machen, ist ein Kapital von €5.000 notwendig. Um dieses Kapital zu bekommen, werden Shirt-Futures verkauft. Hilf mit Apson zu starten, indem du dir ein Shirt-Future holst!

<p>Hi everyone! Thank you for visiting our Indiegogo project. We are very very very (i think you get the gist) excited about this because we know that our product, the <strong>ibanglez</strong> fills a gap in the market for the Ipod Nano to be worn as a FASHIONABLE WATCH. Unlike the other products already in the market, ibanglez is very fashionable, beautiful, &amp; because we're using only pure stainless steel, the quality is absolutely superb.</p>
<p>The idea for the <strong>ibanglez</strong> came about when my wife wanted to wear the Ipod Nano as a watch. After searching for a strap that she might like, we were disappointed since they were almost exclusively designed for men or simply looked and suited men better. There was nothing available that she could wear to complement her outfits whenever she wanted to accessorize. For this reason, we wanted to give women an alternative... something fun, funky, beautiful &amp; worn together with the Nano! The Ipod Nano is definitely a revolutionary product and we really felt like it needed a deserving &amp; beautiful band to complement it!</p>

<p>For this reason, the idea of <strong>ibanglez</strong> was born &amp; we have not looked back since! </p>
<p><strong>ibanglez invented with help from beyond?</strong></p>
<p>From idea to prototyping, this has definitely been a difficult task, but the journey to creating the <strong>ibanglez</strong> has been awesome since day one. I'm the kind of guy that has always had a million ideas but never really acted on them. Now, since I've made the step to convert from my frustrating export job to the creative field, I've really been feeling a new zest for life &amp; I'm absolutely loving it. With this happiness i'm feeling, I know for a fact that I'm reflecting this energy into my work and with great hopes it will only keep you guys, our backers, very happy with the finished product.</p>
<p><strong>Hope you love your presents (Rewards).</strong></p>
<p>We have 2 editions of iBanglez for you to start off with.</p>
<p>Our first edition is the ""SPOT ON"" edition which comes in eight colors: black, blue, green, orange, pink, purple, red, &amp; white. This reward is for $50 per piece, Ipod not included (USA &amp; Canada delivery included) &amp; will retail at $69 in the future.</p>

<h2>O čemu je riječ!?</h2>
<p>Ove godine Susret hrvatske katoličke mladeži održava se u Đakovačko-osječkoj nadbiskupiji i u gradu Vukovaru. Želimo da vam ovaj susret doista bude poseban, ne samo u sjećanjima nego i kroz uspomenu koju ćete moći svakodnevno upotrijebiti. Stoga su u suradnji s vukovarskom tvornicom Borovo dizajnirane posebne Startas tenisice za mlade koji će biti na Susretu, ali također i za one koji iz raznih razloga neće moći doći.</p>
<h2>Je li ovo nešto više od same kupnje tenisica?</h2>
<p>Naravno!</p>
<p>Kupnjom ovih tenisica nećete samo dobiti trajnu i lijepu uspomenu na ovaj događaj, nego ćete i pomoći gradu Vukovaru. Tenisice izrađuje tvornica Borovo, koja zapošljava mnoge Vukovarce i na ovaj način želimo promovirati gospodarski rast grada Vukovara.</p>
<h3>Pomoć za bolnicu u Vukovaru</h3>
<p>Također, od svakog prodanog para tenisica po 50 kn ići će za pomoć bolnici u gradu Vukovaru. Vukovarska je bolnica mjesto na kojemu medicinsko osoblje iz dana u dan pomaže velikomu broju ljudi iz Vukovara i okolice. Ona je imala i posebnu ulogu u vrijeme Domovinskoga rata, kada je bila svakodnevno razarana. Usprkos tome, medicinsko osoblje bolnice spasilo je mnoge živote i pomagalo braniteljima i civilima Vukovara u borbi za slobodu. </p>
<h2>Startasice za tebe!</h2>
<p>Ukoliko želiš i ti imati Startasice sa ovoga susreta, podrži ovu inicijativu svojim <i>pledgeom. </i>Potrebno nam je skupiti najmanje 1,000 narudžbi do kraja veljače kako bismo mogli krenuti u izradu ovih tenisica. Možete naručiti mušku verziju (plava sa crvenim logom) i žensku verziju (crvena s plavim logom).</p>
<p>Imaš priliku dobiti jedinstvenu uspomenu na Susret hrvatske katoličke mladeži u Vukovaru, a isto tako i pomoći Gradu-heroju kako bi budućnost bila bolja.</p>

They couldn't believe how much enthusiasm people would have for them or how much fun they'd have wearing them. They had such a  good time that they rediscovered their love for partying! Now you too can rediscover your love for partying and have: 
An instant conversation starter with anyone - let us know if you meet the one ;)
A ton of enthusiasm from friends and strangers alike
A party atmosphere 'light' no other... see what i did there ;) 
  Change the world by having fun It's the simplest principle but sometimes we all forget to just have a good time. Be silly, be up for anything and have fun. You've probably heard of the butterfly effect. Well, just think... you could be wearing you're light up suspenders to your friends birthday party, make their week and start a train of positive vibes that brings peace to the middle east!!I'm not saying it's probable but .... it could happen! :)  Light up your friends day I bet you could come up with a reason to gift these to every person on your Christmas List...
Cousin Jonny just loves to party.
Auntie Murial can use these to find her way to the toilet in the night.
Little James has always wanted a slingshot he can use in the dark.

We had to do something...
In face of this tragic reality, we decided some light should be brought to this problem!
We couldn't let things get darker and two years ago we had the idea of increasing the safety of ""low-light living creatures"", such as runners, cyclists, walkers, trekkers, workers... through illuminated smart clothing.
A multi‑purpose top‑notch illuminated jacket seemed the perfect candidate for the mission and that's how MUSGO was born.
MUSGO cool design incorporates optical fibers that constitute the core of the illumination system and with a dedicated mobile app the smart illumination is controlled.
MUSGO in the mediaPlease, show me the app!With the mobile app, your MUSGO jacket will be alive and able to be continuously upgraded with new functionalities.    Where is all this light coming from?MUSGO Light Engine is at the center of the illumination system Yeah, you'll go (coco)nuts when you read this...MUSGO is made with a fabric that has activated carbon particles made of recycled coconut shells that empowers all adventurers to challenge the sun, the wind, the rain, the heat, and the cold, knowing these elements are part of the game rather than announcing that the game is over.Products made with this enriched fabric passed with distinction tests conducted in the Sahara desert, in the Antarctic region, as well as with professional athletes and weekend warriors.  
WHERE'S CLOVER?____
If you're not yet convinced that MUSGO is a winning bet, we still have something for you
We consider ourselves lucky guys (great family, epic friends, good health...) and want to share this happy feeling with you.Because of that, you'll find your lucky clover hidden inside of an inner pocket, for you to touch it, kiss it, smell it... whenever you feel you need that ""extra boost"" to put ""wind in your favor"".

Thinkers & BelieversWhat do the inventors have to say?And the partners?MUSGO ColorsFAQs & Curiosities What in the h3ll is a ""Radiation Block Pocket""?MUSGO jacket has a pocket specially designed to isolate your body from your phone's radiation.
It consists of a layer built from a special fabric made of silver threads that can attenuate up to 80 dB (in case you don't know, that's A LOT!!! ) the radiation emitted by your phone. It is placed on the chest in front of where your heart is! Are there any extras available?Sure!
The following cool extras are available:

3-modes Snood: balaclava; noise cover; scarf
Detachable Vest for those chilly days
Detachable Hand Stirrups for greater comfort and awesome look
 Which colors can I choose for my MUSGO?MUSGO jacket is available in Indigo Blue and Gray Tan. How do I know which size fits me better? How much does MUSGO weight?Less than 1 kg (35.3 ounces).Care was taken when choosing MUSGO fabrics and materials to provide the best wearability and comfort. What is the battery life of MUSGO Light Engine?
Solid color mode: 25 hours
Flashing color mode (2x/second): 50 hours

MUSGO Light Engine optoelectronic circuits were designed to maximize battery lifetime, while powering intense brightness to the smart illumination system. Can I still see my safety increased without a smartphone?The answer is ""Yes!"".
MUSGO Light Engine allows you to scroll through a set of predefined colors and effects with a push of a button. All you have to do is to squeeze it.
However, without the smartphone, all the smart functionalities derived from the use of the its sensors will not be available and you will not enjoy the full experience. Will I need to pay for the app?The app will be available for iOS and Android, completely free to download with no monthly fees or extra costs. Why are you crowdfunding?Your precious funding will allow us to:

Finish the development and integration of new features in the Lapa app
Fabricate the plastic injection mold for the MUSGO Light Engine
Bluetooth certification (CE + FCC) of the MUSGO Light Engine
Reach the minimum production volume necessary to sustain/achieve the announced campaign price
 Why order now?By backing this project today, you'll get to own a MUSGO at an exclusive price that won’t be offered again commercially. Can you tell me the soundtrack that was used in your promotional video? I really like it!Sure! 'be-dom' is the name of the Portuguese Alternative Percussion band that granted us permission to use their track. This band uses recycled materials (like our jacket) to create instruments and scenarios.""Bigalhona"" is the name of the track.FOLLOW MUSGO

<h3>Hi there,</h3>
<p><br/>My name is Emily and I am embarking on an exciting new venture and would LOVE for you to get involved and join me on the journey.</p>
<p>I am a costume and prop maker, and have been working in the film, theatre and tv industry for the last 12 years. I am happiest when being creative and making things with my own hands.<br/>I have an unbridled passion for footwear, and have decided to meld my craft and my passion to create a brand new footwear company. However, as anyone in the costume business will tell you, the pay isn't brilliant; I have already used all of my meagre savings in starting the set-up, and now I need YOUR help!<br/><br/>Peau De Soie will create footwear that will not only be beautiful, whimsical and playful, but practical too. My knowledge of creating costumes and props will allow me to create sculptural, but wearable pieces of art.</p>
<h3>What your contribution will mean...</h3>
<p>This funding will help me to do a number of things:</p>
<p>1: Set up a website with E-Commerce capabilites<br/><br/>2: Purchase the shoe lasts:-<br/> This is by far the most expensive part of the set-up costs. Shoes cannot be made without lasts, they are the mould on which the shoes are created. In order to be able to offer customers a reasonable choice of designs, I will need to buy approximately 18 pairs of lasts. Each pair is handmade and take around 2 weeks to make.</p>
<p>3: Buy raw materials:-<br/>An average pair of shoes has 12 seperate components. Each of these components needs to be sourced and purchased. As the footwear industry in this country is tiny compared to times gone by, I will need to purchase the components in bulk. Again, I need funds to do that.</p>
<p>I have decided to go with Fixed Funding, as I want you to be confident that the money I raise will go 100% towards the business. If I do not raise the full amount, you will get back your investment in full.</p>
<h3>Peau De Soie - Not just another footwear brand</h3>
<p>Peau De Soie will be 100% British.</p>
<p>Every supplier will be UK-based, and all materials will be traceable, from ethically conscious sources.<br/>I also have plans to use recycled materials as much as possible.</p>

<p>Gemalli started a few years ago when Andrew and Graham were hanging out and discussing cool new product ideas. They realized that there hasn't been any big shake-ups in the eyewear industry for a long time.  After lots of talk and a simple napkin sketch, Gemalli was born. As they talked more about the concept they realized that it was something worth pursuing and so they spent the next couple years perfecting the style, testing tons of different materials for the lenses and arms, fitting prototype after prototype and designing the ideal sunglasses case.  It has been a long process but the result is even better than expected.  These are not your ordinary sunglasses!</p>
<p>Gemalli sunglasses feature high quality polarized lenses, 3 finishes on the cast aluminum frames and 3 different handcrafted exotic wood arms.   The perfect blend of raw materials, great design, and modern technology creates a distinct look that won't go unnoticed!</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge to this project is facilitating and timing the production of different parts coming from different manufacturers. Even though we've been working with a few different vendors and built strong relationships with them; there are often small unforeseen changes when shifting from samples to final production. We will make sure that in the end, the best possible product is delivered.</p>
<p>This means that if small changes are necessary there could be short delays but we will keep you updated on the process and work hard to get the shades to you as soon as possible!</p>

<p style="""">After multiple factory closures due to the international withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2014, the Combat Flip Flops team had to design a factory, build a production line, and knock out flip flops for paid orders on a shoestring budget in the good ol' USA.  The result was a highly efficient, reduced footprint, easily maintained factory operated with little to no training.  </p>
<blockquote>Trust us--we had zero training and made over 3,000 pair of flip flops over the course of two months.</blockquote>
<p>The thought occured to us, ""Why can't we put this model in Afghanistan?""  So we went to the drawing board and designed our factory to be placed in Afghanistan.  The result is a flip flop factory shipped in a 40' shipping container--<b>The Expeditionary Production Facility.</b></p>

<br/>FAQ-CFF Products</h3>
<p><b>Your company is named ""Combat Flip Flops.""  Why are you making products other than footwear?</b>  If you haven't picked up on it yet, most of our messaging is tongue-in-cheek.   A ""flip flop"" is a piece of footwear, but it also refers to a change in position or belief.  We once believed that serving our nation required us to be in a uniform and carry a rifle.  Now we understand that promoting a positive image of the U.S. through business is the best thing we can do for our country.  So, in all senses... we're flip flops.  If you don't get it, no worries.  If you do, you can be a flip flop too.</p>
<p><b>Why are Combat Flip Flops so freaking awesome?</b> We don't know.  They just are.  All kidding aside, we try to bridge the gap between functionality, fashion, and durability.  CFF outsoles are made from military grade combat boot rubber, not thermopastic resin, EVA, or other materials that wear out in a matter of months.  The design team has a condition that ends in ""retentive"" and doesn't sleep until they've figured out the exact durometer of EVA that breaks in under a Wookie after a month of wear.  We're all married, so we understand that not only does a piece of footwear have too look good, but it has to feel good against the skin.  And lastly, we have the, <i><b>""I'd rock that"" Factor</b></i>.  Nothing is released until the CFF team unanimously agrees, <i>""Hell yeah, I'd rock that.""</i>  </p>
<p><b>Why are your products so expensive?</b>  Believe it or not, there are a lot of costs that go into developing new products with the criteria of ""post-conflict"" production.  Shipping is the big one.  Have you ever bought 2,000 pairs of flip flop parts, stuffed them into a container, and shipped them into a war zone?  Probably not.  We did.  It's ridiculously expensive.  On the other hand, the raised eyebrows by customs agents are worth the pain of writing the check.  Other than that, we have to pay duties for raw materials going to most manufacturing locations, duties for finished products leaving the country, and import duties into the EU and U.S..  The bills rack up.  If you're able to help with less expensive (reliable) shipping and a reduction in duties, please contact us at info@combatflipflops.com.</p>

<br/><p></p><h2>What is the Pitbull Wallet?</h2>
The Pitbull Wallet is a credit card sized device for you to safely store your passwords, cryptocoin wallets and other sets of public/private keys. It is <em>NOT</em> a credit or debit card. You will be able to store multiple wallets for multiple types of cryptocoins - Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, Novacoin, Feathercoin, ... even Dogecoin... (Wow... much safe... very crypto). You can also store passwords so you only have to remember one of them.
And it is so simple to use! You don't need any special app to manage it or anything. For more detailed information, please visit <a href=""http://pitbull.ondatechnology.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the official project page</a>.
<h3>Using it</h3>
Your public address is easily reachable. You just have to navigate through the addresses stored. The private keys will be locked
using one single password that can be entered using the embedded keyboard when needed.

<h2>Why the Pitbull Wallet?</h2>
<p>
  For many reasons. If you have cryptocurrency, you need it. It's a safe and versatile way to store your digital wallets. It is also a practical way to store other types of public/private key pairs as well as passwords.
</p>
<p>You can keep it anywhere and make it inaccessible from less trustworthy individuals.</p>
<p>The safest digital wallet is the one that is kept offline. Instead of printing it in fragile piece of paper or using an offline computer, just ""pitbull it"". It's more convenient and practical, it's stored digitally as well, but accessible and safe at the same time.
</p>
<h3>Why ""Pitbull""?</h3>
<p>Dogs are always thought of as the ""man's best friend"" and Pitbulls are the usual iconic representation of their protective nature.</p><p>We are helping protect someone's property, so why not Pitbull?</p>

<p>
This device has an e-paper screen to display your addresses and keys.
The keyboard below the screen allows you to control the card - adding wallets, browsing your wallets, and maybe - if funding allows - even perform some quick calculations or conversions.</p>
<p>
The embedded battery lasts for a long time, after which your card needs replacing - the battery cannot be replaced separately. But don't worry, you won't lose your data, you will only lose the ability to use
the card's screen without external power supply. And you don't need to (or should) throw away your old card.</p>
<p>
If the battery dies, you can still access your data by using a very simple external power supply. Soon after we start shipping the cards, we will also make available a simple and cheap connector for that.</p>
<h3>Project status</h3>
<p>
The design is not yet final and features may still change a little. At the moment we are negotiating with the
factory but, to do so, we need to have a clearer picture of the market.</p>

You can also put your company logo or anything reasonable you like.
<h2>Costs, manufacturing and shipping</h2>
<h3>Is it expensive?</h3>
<p>
We don't think so. Most of us who have debit cards pay about $15-$25 per year just for that privilege and up to twice as much for a VISA or MasterCard credit card, depending on your bank and limit. We are asking for $25 for a card with a battery which lasts for three to five years and that can still be used even if the internal battery is depleted.</p>
<p>
In order for the card manufacturing to go ahead, we need to achieve a minimum order volume defined by our manufacturing partner, as well as to pay for the initial R&amp;D costs and all the logistics behind this
project. We cannot order just a few dozens and, besides, the bigger the order, the cheaper it will be for everyone.</p>

</center>
<h3>And if the goal is not met?</h3>
If the IndieGoGo funding goal is not met, well, in that case, you will not get your card. But you will also get your money back. So, no harm there. There are a lot of things that can go wrong at any time, we will not paint a pretty picture telling you everything will be ok. A meteor might hit the factory. Someone may steal the idea and flood the market. But not meeting the funding goal is the least of our concerns. We're more
concerned on, if we do meet the goal, providing you with the best product possible.
<h3>Funding stages</h3>
<p>The base $150k will allow us to order an initial batch of cards and pay for all associated costs. We need to order a minimum of 6000 cards in the initial batch or manufacturing will not go ahead.</p>
<p>An additional $50k will allow us to invest more of our and the manufacturer's time in R&amp;D to improve the
card and give it additional functionalities (in-card calculator and currency conversion, better interface,
additional means to exchange data with the card, etc) and <em>possibly</em> offer the shipping fee.</p>
<p>Manufacturing is expected to begin May or June 2014 and
shipping August 2014. Delays are possible, but we'll do our best to ship your gift to you as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Shipping</h3>
<p>At the moment we can't promise free shipping as the cost per card depends heavily on the order
volume. If the initial batch is big enough and drives the price down sufficiently, we will offer the shipping
fee. If that goal is achieved, we will warn you on our website, Facebook, Blog, Twitter...</p>
<p>What else will the funding be used for? Any surplus
funds will first be used to offer shipping if possible and the remainder to boost other research projects at our institution, which includes future generations of the Pitbull Wallet. Some of them might even get to be here on IndieGoGo as well, when they are mature enough.

<p>Having successfully completed and delivered several campaigns, we have first-hand experience in executing a campaign from start to finish. We have tested several manufacturers, and have selected a manufacturer with whom we've worked with in several of our designs. The inherent risks of this project include maintaining the quality of the product from the first item to the last one sold. That said, we will be personally in charge of assembling and dispatching our pledge rewards, and in so doing identify items that are not up to par. Another risk pertains to shipping or production delays. Although every project comes with its own risks and challenges, our familiarity with our manufacturer coupled with our knowledge of the production process serve to mitigate this.</p>

<p>My name is Michael Eacrett and I am a finance student at York University in Toronto with additional post-secondary accreditation in New Venture Development and New Product Innovation and Management. I have developed several different product ideas of varying complexity that I am now ready to start bringing to market. The only catch is, in order to pull the trigger on the action plans I need to raise certain levels of funding. Of all the ideas, I have progressed GamePants the furthest in having had samples produced, distribution established, manufacturing secured and a patent pending on my enhancement.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/72802_115669548629572_2019714829_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Product Description:</strong></p>
<p>Now you're asking, ""what are GamePants?"". GamePants are the most comfortable sweatpants that have ever graced the human body with an enhancement that will forever change your lounging, outdoor recreation, sport playing, tailgating, Barbequing, camping, studying and TV watching experience.</p>
<p>I have developed a pocket (GameTech Pocket) that has been inserted into the lower portion of the front crotch seam that when open provides the most convenient place ever to accommodate your beverage in-between sips. I know at first the idea may come across as silly or even as a novelty product; but, while conducting my market research I found people loved the product and provided me with many more scenarios for its use then I had originally thought.</p>

<p><strong>GameTech Pocket:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>The GameTech Pocket has been created to serve as a utility pocket, be it for holding beverages or any other use you deem it fit for. </p>
<p>Features of the GameTech Pocket:</p>
<p>-     Stretches to accommodate different size drinking vessels</p>
<p>-     Built in elastic to snuggly hold the contents</p>
<p>-     Closed by a hidden zipper</p>
<p>-     *May be treated to provide a level water resistance* (have not yet decided if this is necessary or feasible).</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>What makes this innovation so special is not the technology behind it (as that’s pretty simple) but the convenience it provides the user. It is so obvious that I'm amazed that I have the privilege to bring it to the world.</p>
<p>Rest assured that the positioning of the GameTech Pocket does not interfere with the anatomy of any user. </p>
<p><strong>Inspiration:</strong></p>
<p>I came up with this idea 2 years ago while taking in my first tailgating experience. Thousands of people were jumping from camp to camp in what is one of the largest ongoing social communities in the US. Regardless of whether or not we (my 2 brothers and I) knew any of the people, we were invited into many camps and given beverages. While there were ample places to sit (lawn/lounge chairs, tailgates, benches, etc...) there was nowhere for me to set my drink aside from the ground or in my hand. I figured there had to be some simple answer. I also noticed the most common type of pants being worn were sweatpants. I let those observations sit in the back of my mind to see what I could come up with. Shortly after, I was camping with some buddies and again noticed the same problem.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/535853_115664491963411_97301304_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It wasn't until sitting on my couch watching TV, while leaning forwards to get my drink off the coffee table and being frustrated by the condensation ring it left on the glass, that it hit me. There is a lot of extra room in the build of sweatpants to house a hidden pocket that will not affect the users comfort when in use or not in use.</p>
<p><strong>Solving the Problem:</strong></p>
<p>First, I measured the height and diameter of cans (355ml), bottles (473ml and 500ml), as well as sport drink bottles and the stereotypical plastic red drinking cup.</p>
<p>Second, I created a fabric pouch that would fit all these vessels with an elastic band stitched in to hold all containers snugly. In order to ensure proper installation in a manner that wouldn't cause any discomfort, I enlisted the help of a professional costume maker/seamstress.</p>
<p>Third, I sourced out a patent lawyer to advise me on protecting my innovation and began the patent process.</p>
<p>Fourth, I used industry websites, like Alibaba, to solicit manufacturing quotes. After having received more than 15 responses I devised a list of general industry questions along with some product specific ones that would provide me with a source of screening. After finding a good match I progressed to having samples made.</p>
<p>Fifth, I used these samples to conduct two studies, the 'User Needs and Wants' study and 'Concept Test'. I conducted these studies with random people to further define my target market. These studies helped me determine the degree to which the market would/would not accept the GamePants product. </p>
<p>Some Interesting Study findings:</p>
<p>- While initially I thought this product would primarily appeal to the male population, the studies showed that females share an equal interest.</p>
<p>- Our product appeals to a broad age group (18-55); however, the different age demographics interest in the product were for different thus requiring modified marketing approaches for the different age segments.</p>
<p>- The studies confirmed that a $40 retail price is safely within the expected price range of respondents.</p>
<p>Product Progress:</p>
<p>To date I have accomplished the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patent pending status (provisional patent).</li>
<li>Prototypes produced.</li>
<li>Marketing plan developed.</li>
<li>Conducted a 'User Needs and Wants' study.</li>
<li>Conducted a 'Concept Test' study that resulted in uncovering this product has a 73% acceptance rate amongst our target market with an identified intent to purchase.</li>
<li>Full cost analysis.</li>
<li>Detailed action plan with logical and achievable deadlines. If the funding goal is achieved the target launch date is July 21, 2013.</li>
</ul><p>As well as a lot more.</p>
<p>GamePants is now at the phase where all I need to do is reach my funding goals and then I can implement my action plan that will have GamePants manufactured and available online within 2.5 months. </p>
<p>In helping me achieve my funding goals you will be bringing purpose to what I have been building towards for nearly a decade while introducing the world to a great innovation in personal comfort. Additionally, I just received notice from  my manufacturer that they</p>
<p><strong>Why the $35K</strong> </p>
<p>After 2 year of navigating regulations, securing provisional patents, R&amp;D, testing countless closures (Velcro, hidden zipper, etc..), numerous sewing lessons and fights with the machines, dealing with customs and certifying agencies, prototyping, and test dummies I need $35,000 to get GamePants to the next phase of development.   </p>
<p>By reaching the $35,000 goal I will be able to pay for all of the advanced manufacturing costs and back end business development. This in turn will allow me to create the best product, at the best price, with the best performance and the best chance of success. If I am unable to reach the entire funding goal, the process will be slowed drastically. The manufacturing costs will skyrocket as my manufacturing contract will expire if not used, driving up the estimated retail price, potentially pricing it out of the market and delaying the release of GamePants inevitably. </p>
<p><strong>Production Plan</strong></p>
<p>Once the $35K is raised, it will take approx 85 days to take the GamePants from sample/prototype to full manufacturing run (this includes a test run to ensure all the bugs are worked out). During this time I will fully develop the back-end of the business. Once all of the aspects of the business have been assembled the GamePants will undergo a final round of inspection and then shipped to your door! I already have my distribution method in place along with my incorporation underway and my intellectual property protected. At the point of pulling the trigger on the final phase but I just need the ammo.  </p>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>My highest priority before bringing GamePants and the Gamezee to the Indiegogo community was to ensure, to the best of my ability, every aspect of production was accounted for. This would allow me to give an accurate expectation as to when GamePants and the Gamezee would be delivered. I took the number of days that my vendors promised me and added 30%, allowing a buffer, in case I encounter unplanned production delays.  But like all things in this world, nothing is certain. I do believe I have accounted for all variables but should obstacles arise I will be completely open and upfront, keeping my supporters informed of all pertinent information. </p>
<p><strong>GAMEZEE:</strong></p>
<p>My manufacturer has informed me that they can add the GameTech Pocket to a full body jump-suite (Gamezee), similar to a 'Onezie"". To be clear I am not launching this product yet but I have included it for different levels of support to get some market feedback. Please note that the pictures are taken from the manufacturers website and are being used for illustrative purposes.</p>
<p><strong>PERKS for our BACKERS, the gift of giving to those that give to us</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gatekeepers ($15 Perk)</strong></p>
<p>There is an undeniable value in having an engaged honest feedback group when developing new products. Such a group saves money, time and can provide insights that myself or any creator would never realize on our own. For this level of support you will have the option to be just that. I will put together a group of willing backers to use as my initial focus group for screening my ideas (and I have some good ones).</p>

<p><strong>Super Early Birds</strong> <strong>($42 Perk) Get Your GamePants on!</strong></p>
<p>This one is for those who want to be the first to wear GamePants. Backers of this level will have their choice of size (XXS-XL) and either black or dark Grey. I will be doing a special run for my backers to ensure they are the first to fully enjoy the benefits this fine product will bring to the lives of many. There is a cost to shipping ($12 Canada/US) that has been added ($30 for GamePants, $12 for shipping in Canada and the US. Outside Canada and the US add another $12).

<p> <strong>What you are doing by helping….</strong></p>
<p>After two years, I have finally designed, tested, retested (sigh of relief), and at last arrived at my destination, a perfect marriage of comfort and utility. GamePants are an extremely well made piece of clothing using only high quality materials. I believe this is a great addition to the comfort clothing market and will provide the user with the ultimate comfort experience. </p>
<p>By supporting this campaign now, you have the opportunity of getting one of the first GamePants, Gamezee's or just helping to ensure they are available down the road when you choose to maximize your comfort. Additionally, by backing this campaign you will be helping bring other products, like the Gamezee, to the market.  </p>
<p>You are also helping to bring into existence a novel new product, one that will reduce the loss of great beverages to unnecessary spillage. Additionally, GamePants opens the door to all kind of social games. I believe this is the best comfort product since the Snuggy. </p>
<p><strong><em>Please, please</em></strong>, get the word out there to any of your friends and family you think might be able to benefit from GamePants, or if you just think it’s a fun novel idea. All contributions, be it time or money are greatly appreciated.  I couldn't make this adventure happen without the willingness of my backers and I will be forever grateful to all of you!!! </p>

</ul><p> </p></div>","Who I Am:
My name is Michael Eacrett and I am a finance student at York University in Toronto with additional post-secondary accreditation in New Venture Development and New Product Innovation and Management. I have developed several different product ideas of varying complexity that I am now ready to start bringing to market. The only catch is, in order to pull the trigger on the action plans I need to raise certain levels of funding. Of all the ideas, I have progressed GamePants the furthest in having had samples produced, distribution established, manufacturing secured and a patent pending on my enhancement.

Product Description:
Now you're asking, ""what are GamePants?"". GamePants are the most comfortable sweatpants that have ever graced the human body with an enhancement that will forever change your lounging, outdoor recreation, sport playing, tailgating, Barbequing, camping, studying and TV watching experience.
I have developed a pocket (GameTech Pocket) that has been inserted into the lower portion of the front crotch seam that when open provides the most convenient place ever to accommodate your beverage in-between sips. I know at first the idea may come across as silly or even as a novelty product; but, while conducting my market research I found people loved the product and provided me with many more scenarios for its use then I had originally thought.
 
 
Specs:
Fabric:
-      77% Cotton/23% Polyester
-      320 gsm material(High quality weight)
-      Pockets on the sides
Colours:
-      Black
-      Dark Grey
 
Sizes:
The pants are based on male sizes but scaled so that women should order 1 size smaller than they normally would (ie. If a female usually wears a small they should order a XS pair of GamePants).
-      Extra Large (XL)
-      Large (L)
-      Medium (M)
-      Small (S)
-      Extra Small (XS)
-      Extra Extra Small (XXS)
The pocket is closed by a hidden zipper that is inset in the seam so when closed it is completely undistinguishable.
Features:
-     GameTech pocket in the in-seam
-     Pockets on the sides
-     Drawstring and elastic waistband
-     Drawstrings at the ankle to tighten if desired
 
GameTech Pocket:
The GameTech Pocket has been created to serve as a utility pocket, be it for holding beverages or any other use you deem it fit for. 
Features of the GameTech Pocket:
-     Stretches to accommodate different size drinking vessels
-     Built in elastic to snuggly hold the contents
-     Closed by a hidden zipper
-     *May be treated to provide a level water resistance* (have not yet decided if this is necessary or feasible).
What makes this innovation so special is not the technology behind it (as that’s pretty simple) but the convenience it provides the user. It is so obvious that I'm amazed that I have the privilege to bring it to the world.
Rest assured that the positioning of the GameTech Pocket does not interfere with the anatomy of any user. 
Inspiration:
I came up with this idea 2 years ago while taking in my first tailgating experience. Thousands of people were jumping from camp to camp in what is one of the largest ongoing social communities in the US. Regardless of whether or not we (my 2 brothers and I) knew any of the people, we were invited into many camps and given beverages. While there were ample places to sit (lawn/lounge chairs, tailgates, benches, etc...) there was nowhere for me to set my drink aside from the ground or in my hand. I figured there had to be some simple answer. I also noticed the most common type of pants being worn were sweatpants. I let those observations sit in the back of my mind to see what I could come up with. Shortly after, I was camping with some buddies and again noticed the same problem.

It wasn't until sitting on my couch watching TV, while leaning forwards to get my drink off the coffee table and being frustrated by the condensation ring it left on the glass, that it hit me. There is a lot of extra room in the build of sweatpants to house a hidden pocket that will not affect the users comfort when in use or not in use.
Solving the Problem:
First, I measured the height and diameter of cans (355ml), bottles (473ml and 500ml), as well as sport drink bottles and the stereotypical plastic red drinking cup.
Second, I created a fabric pouch that would fit all these vessels with an elastic band stitched in to hold all containers snugly. In order to ensure proper installation in a manner that wouldn't cause any discomfort, I enlisted the help of a professional costume maker/seamstress.
Third, I sourced out a patent lawyer to advise me on protecting my innovation and began the patent process.
Fourth, I used industry websites, like Alibaba, to solicit manufacturing quotes. After having received more than 15 responses I devised a list of general industry questions along with some product specific ones that would provide me with a source of screening. After finding a good match I progressed to having samples made.
Fifth, I used these samples to conduct two studies, the 'User Needs and Wants' study and 'Concept Test'. I conducted these studies with random people to further define my target market. These studies helped me determine the degree to which the market would/would not accept the GamePants product. 
Some Interesting Study findings:
- While initially I thought this product would primarily appeal to the male population, the studies showed that females share an equal interest.
- Our product appeals to a broad age group (18-55); however, the different age demographics interest in the product were for different thus requiring modified marketing approaches for the different age segments.
- The studies confirmed that a $40 retail price is safely within the expected price range of respondents.
Product Progress:
To date I have accomplished the following:

Patent pending status (provisional patent).
Prototypes produced.
Marketing plan developed.
Conducted a 'User Needs and Wants' study.
Conducted a 'Concept Test' study that resulted in uncovering this product has a 73% acceptance rate amongst our target market with an identified intent to purchase.
Full cost analysis.
Detailed action plan with logical and achievable deadlines. If the funding goal is achieved the target launch date is July 21, 2013.
As well as a lot more.
GamePants is now at the phase where all I need to do is reach my funding goals and then I can implement my action plan that will have GamePants manufactured and available online within 2.5 months. 
In helping me achieve my funding goals you will be bringing purpose to what I have been building towards for nearly a decade while introducing the world to a great innovation in personal comfort. Additionally, I just received notice from  my manufacturer that they
Why the $35K 
After 2 year of navigating regulations, securing provisional patents, R&D, testing countless closures (Velcro, hidden zipper, etc..), numerous sewing lessons and fights with the machines, dealing with customs and certifying agencies, prototyping, and test dummies I need $35,000 to get GamePants to the next phase of development.   
By reaching the $35,000 goal I will be able to pay for all of the advanced manufacturing costs and back end business development. This in turn will allow me to create the best product, at the best price, with the best performance and the best chance of success. If I am unable to reach the entire funding goal, the process will be slowed drastically. The manufacturing costs will skyrocket as my manufacturing contract will expire if not used, driving up the estimated retail price, potentially pricing it out of the market and delaying the release of GamePants inevitably. 
Production Plan
Once the $35K is raised, it will take approx 85 days to take the GamePants from sample/prototype to full manufacturing run (this includes a test run to ensure all the bugs are worked out). During this time I will fully develop the back-end of the business. Once all of the aspects of the business have been assembled the GamePants will undergo a final round of inspection and then shipped to your door! I already have my distribution method in place along with my incorporation underway and my intellectual property protected. At the point of pulling the trigger on the final phase but I just need the ammo.  
Risks and Challenges
My highest priority before bringing GamePants and the Gamezee to the Indiegogo community was to ensure, to the best of my ability, every aspect of production was accounted for. This would allow me to give an accurate expectation as to when GamePants and the Gamezee would be delivered. I took the number of days that my vendors promised me and added 30%, allowing a buffer, in case I encounter unplanned production delays.  But like all things in this world, nothing is certain. I do believe I have accounted for all variables but should obstacles arise I will be completely open and upfront, keeping my supporters informed of all pertinent information. 
GAMEZEE:
My manufacturer has informed me that they can add the GameTech Pocket to a full body jump-suite (Gamezee), similar to a 'Onezie"". To be clear I am not launching this product yet but I have included it for different levels of support to get some market feedback. Please note that the pictures are taken from the manufacturers website and are being used for illustrative purposes.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Dismayed with the lack of uniqueness in the jewelry market, we decided to create something different. Three years ago, we bought a poor quality miniature wooden ring on the internet. We did not receive what we ordered, totally different than the pictures. </p>
<p>We knew we could do something better and we decided to create a range of our rings. After working 2-3 years on perfectioning rings, we discovered the secret of making these rings </p>
<p>We worked hard to create a ring more unique and of better quality than anything else on the market. <br/>We knew we were on to something when we put up on Facebook a batch of six rings we created by hand. We sold them all<br/>In fact, one man was so stunned by the way the ring looked in the photographs that he bought one and used it to propose to his girlfriend. The beauty of the ring knocked her socks off and, of course, she said yes.</p>
<p>Each ring is carefully created by hand and imparted with natural materials such as flowers, wood, moss, amber, corals, etc. The result makes each jewel look as if it contains its own hidden world. </p>

<h3>What makes us Unique?</h3>
<p>After 2-3 years of experiment...Together, we’ve created our own ultra-clear epoxy resin formula tailored for the brand. This cures much more slowly than other epoxy blends and so seals the wood perfectly. It won’t yellow with time or when under sunlight. It’s also tougher than market resins and smooths better during sanding.</p>
<p>we’ve also created our own coloring agents to work with this specific type of epoxy. These won’t fade after a few months and so the rings will look vibrant for years to come.</p>
<p>Take a look at the high detailing below....</p>

<p>If you're unsure of your ring size, you can use the website below to calculate it for free. All you'll need is something the same size as a  credit card (library card, grocery store club card, etc., or of course a credit card will do) to hold up to the screen to calibrate the size of how images will show up on your monitor. Once you do that, it will give you a chart of circles. Just hold a ring that you knows fits you up to the screen and find the circle it matches with. Or, you can go to a jewelry store and they'll be able to tell you your size for free. But do not worry if you get your size wrong we will be happy to exchange it for you with no extra cost.</p>

<p>The main challenge with this campaign will be delivering the custom made rings on time.

Short Summary
Dismayed with the lack of uniqueness in the jewelry market, we decided to create something different. Three years ago, we bought a poor quality miniature wooden ring on the internet. We did not receive what we ordered, totally different than the pictures. 
We knew we could do something better and we decided to create a range of our rings. After working 2-3 years on perfectioning rings, we discovered the secret of making these rings 
We worked hard to create a ring more unique and of better quality than anything else on the market. We knew we were on to something when we put up on Facebook a batch of six rings we created by hand. We sold them allIn fact, one man was so stunned by the way the ring looked in the photographs that he bought one and used it to propose to his girlfriend. The beauty of the ring knocked her socks off and, of course, she said yes.
Each ring is carefully created by hand and imparted with natural materials such as flowers, wood, moss, amber, corals, etc. The result makes each jewel look as if it contains its own hidden world.

Our Designs
You can select from these six designs or you can place a custom order. Note - During the campaign, we will be sending out a survey to all of our backers. This survey is where you will specify things like ring size, ring of your selection, your custom ring specifications, etc.

 





 
Want to feel more Special? Then, order a Custom Ring
Order a custom request and we are sure we won't disappoint you.
 
What makes us Unique?
After 2-3 years of experiment...Together, we’ve created our own ultra-clear epoxy resin formula tailored for the brand. This cures much more slowly than other epoxy blends and so seals the wood perfectly. It won’t yellow with time or when under sunlight. It’s also tougher than market resins and smooths better during sanding.
we’ve also created our own coloring agents to work with this specific type of epoxy. These won’t fade after a few months and so the rings will look vibrant for years to come.
Take a look at the high detailing below....

Ridolfi is our family name, our story: we are working to grow and turn a family business into a new brand, in order to offer high quality products crafted by the last artisans and shoemakers of our country.We care a lot about art, craft and comfort. We believe in making unique products, for those who want to live as individuals and stop existing as consumers, moved only by the imposed fashion of the moment. We are excited and we dream to make shoes as unique as the people who are going to wear them. Our brand looks after the whole production, from leathers selection, through model design and hand paint operations, to the sale of an authentic Italian handmade product. Each shoe is unique and tells many stories: that of Italian fine materials used to create it, together with the craftsmanship and the inspiration that leads to the combination of bold colors. Above all, it tells the taste of those who choose it.Get yours and walk with us!  We are artisans. Our main inspirations come from art and nature. It’s not just about the shape, we strongly believe that hand-painted color makes every shoe a distinguished and unique piece, looking back to the great tradition of Italian art. We make our shoes with absolute care and we like to explore the infinite range of creative possibilities, paying serious attention to the research and the quality of top level materials, together with care of comfort (i.e. wide fit and high toe). Our classic Oxford and Derby models are handmade, with a personal touch: unique combinations of materials (leather and suede, gloss and matte finish) and colors.   Our shoes are extraordinarily comfortable, breathable (yes, your feet are really safe) and long-lasting. Colors and materials make these products quite polished, but also wearable for an original touch in everyday life.Wood is our great inspiration for this collection, so why should we use a normal box? ""Take care"" also means pack our shoes in a wooden box, handmade by other local artisans, where we always put a little mid-soft brush and a jar of delicate conditioning cream.  Long story short: because of the industrial process, all the leather shoes of the world are made with leathers already colored in tannery. Leathers usually go inside an automatic spraying paint machine, a big tunnel where they get painted by airbrush and then dried inside an oven. Shoemakers normally buy colored leather from tanneries and then they work it (cutting and assembling, making the shoes).We start from a completely different concept. We buy white leather from tannery, then we cut it, hand paint it (yes, one by one) and assemble it. In our method the color follows the shape of the shoe and the line (not the opposite), creating a design which is unique and impossible to realize in any other industrial way. It's a process that requires more time and more craftsmanship: the final result is stunning, and unique. Then, selling directly to our backers and customers, with no retail increase, we are able to keep affordable prices.Have you ever felt the difference?  (At the present time we are able to produce a maximum of 30 pieces per day, so we set the delivery timeline according to this productive capacity). First of all, we guarantee a product entirely handmade and crafted in Italy, step by step. This is our commitment and our cultural challenge. For us, the brand “Made in Italy” is a promise of beauty and high quality. Italy is inspiring. We see centuries of history, art and culture all over the land, in each beautiful city and little town. We enjoy unique colors, shapes, flavors and views. Wouldn’t it be nice to be part of it?Since every foot is different, we will send to all our backers a simple chart and ask for 2 measurements (in addition to the request of the usual shoe size): this little check will provide the best fit. All our shoes are true to size and very comfortable (with wide fit).ACCESSORIESWe want to do more and give you a world of different and unique possibilities. We like the details and we know you all need beautiful accessories, so we offer our collection of premium quality leather belts, handmade and hand-painted one by one, as our shoes are! We can do something special: paint shoes and belts together, in the same phase of the making process, to obtain unique matching products.

Who is New England Footwear?

Based in Newmarket, NH, New England Footwear disrupts the footwear market by leveraging innovation, challenging conventional thinking, and meeting real human needs in non-obvious ways.
NEF's premiere footwear collection is GoLite Footwear, which includes a range of outdoor footwear from casual to trailrunning.
Doug Clark is the founder and CEO of New England Footwear. He leads a team of footwear industry experts in designing, marketing, and distributing GoLite and other collections to more than 250 retailers across the U.S.
Doug is a 30 year industry veteran. Prior to establishing NEF, he served as the Chief Innovation Officer at The Timberland Company and as leader of its award-winning Invention Factory. Clark led business and product teams at Timberland for 14 years from 1994 to 2008.
Prior to joining Timberland, Clark was a Senior Product Engineer in the Advanced Concepts Group at Reebok and before that spent six years as a researcher in footwear biomechanics labs.
When Doug began his career at Nike in the late seventies, the company still produced shoes in the historic mills of New England.
But within a few years of joining the industry, he watched helplessly as thousands of footwear factories closed all around New England, taking tens of thousands of jobs overseas.
Many of Doug's close friends lost their livelihood, while U.S.-based product teams began making countless trips to Korea, Taiwan, and then China to get shoes made.

Our ""Made in the USA"" Approach

After nearly 30 years of producing in Asia, we have now developed new techniques that allow for a better way to make innovative, high-quality footwear at a competitive price, closer to home.
In 2011, NEF won a prestigous Green Launching Pad Award from the University of New Hampshire.
The grant allowed NEF to explore technology ideas and manufacturing techniques that would exponentially increase the productivity of a production line, and remove 70% of the labor from the process currently used in conventional ""cut, glue, and stitch"" Asian factories.
After two years of innovating on designs, processes, and materials, we now know we can make the same or better shoe for less money - in the USA. And we're ready to take this novel approach to scale.
We believe we can make the same or better shoe for the same or better price- in the USA, not in Asia.
Our approach means less glue, less material, less waste, higher quality, and breakthrough designs never before seen by the consumer.

The Factory is the Future

What we are seeing right now is a shift in the textile market towards being more eco-friendly. With stores like H&amp;M set to have textile recycling bins in all retail stores the change is clear.

We propose to you a simple line of clothing, things everyone consumes; t-shirts, hoodies, socks, underwear, and so on.

Tired of lugging around a purse or clutch every time you leave the house? The Wallette by Wild & Free is the first wallet designed with you in mind. Crossing over from the world of bulky handbags and bland bra stashes, the Wallette simply clips to whatever you’re wearing and adds a splash of style. 3 out of the 5 versions come with genuine Swarovski crystals.Free Shipping for US backers. International backers, please follow the instructions listed with each perk._______________________________________________________________________You don’t have to hide itGuaranteed to work with any style of bra, we see no reason to limit its application to just that - you don’t have to hide it; and if you are in the habit of stuffing things in your bra, the Wallette means you don’t have to be embarrassed to strip down to your lingerie anymore!
_______________________________________________________________Buy a little peace of mindWith the Wallette, here’s a few of the things you will never have to worry about again:

Accidentally drinking away your cab money
Not being able to buy coconut water after a jog because you left your wallet at home
Ruining your cute cocktail dress by wearing the wrong clutch
The panic attacks that typically ensue when you think you lost your purse
Having some sketchy dude rob you just because you instinctively squeezed your purse tighter as you walked past him
_______________________________________________________________Everything you needWhile being as slim as possible, the Wallette accommodates everything you would need for a night out - upto 3 cards and a handful of bills.
_______________________________________________________________The right Wallette for you

Available in a variety of styles ranging from minimalist to flashy, you’re sure to find a Wallette that works with your look. If you’re not one to be tied down to a particular look, you could even have a variety to go with whatever you’re in the mood for! Note: We welcome your feedback on what styles appeal to you the most, so we can better understand the production ratios.

_______________________________________________________________Your involvement
We’re counting on your support to help get production for the Wallette up and running. Having secured manufacturers for the product & packaging, its just a matter of raising the necessary funds to place the minimum production order and take care of warehousing and logistics - thats where this Indiegogo campaign comes in.
_______________________________________________________________Manufacturing
The Wallette will be made from a unique combination of Stainless Steel, Leather, Brass* and genuine Swarovski crystals*.We have a wide network of manufacturers we have worked with in the past, and are positive we can guarantee the highest possible quality to match, and hopefully exceed, your expectations. Our mission statement captures this sentiment the best - we aim to create high-quality crowdfunded products that cater to the well informed, proactive consumer.*Not applicable to all styles_______________________________________________________________Project Status & TimelineBeing a relatively simple idea to execute, we don’t expect any major hiccups in our road to production. That being said, we are still in the process of getting samples made and ironing out some of the functional & production details. We anticipate about 90 days between our funding goal being met and actually shipping orders out._______________________________________________________________Spread the wordAs with any new product launch, the biggest challenge is getting the word out.

<p>Premium Ice is distinguished by its crystal-clear transparency. Because its perfectly-formed lattice structure is devoid of air bubbles &amp; other impurities, it melts slowly.<b>Research shows clear ice melts up to 5 times slower.</b></p>
<p>To us, that‘s the difference between an enjoyable cocktail, good to the last sip; versus a hastily-withering pool of watery booze, a pitiful waste!</p>

Premium Ice is distinguished by its crystal-clear transparency. Because its perfectly-formed lattice structure is devoid of air bubbles & other impurities, it melts slowly.Research shows clear ice melts up to 5 times slower.
To us, that‘s the difference between an enjoyable cocktail, good to the last sip; versus a hastily-withering pool of watery booze, a pitiful waste!
With the aspiration to provide proper companion to your top-shelf liquors and lovingly-executed concoctions, we introduce IceQimo Clear Ice Maker – a simple & flexible way to making Clear Ice in your home fridge.






How Does It Work?
Thanks to the physics of “directional freezing”, the ice made by
IceQimo is crystal-clear. 
By introducing temperature delta, liquid freezes into ice in a controlled fashion, all air bubbles
& impurities are pushed to the bottom of the thermal isolator as the
controlled freezing starts from the top, leaving only clean & structured
ice formation within the mold.  This visual
transparency makes your drinks even more inviting.
Designed
with flexibility & versatility in mind, IceQimo provides you with a full arsenal of clear ice form-factors (3 Shapes), allowing you to exercise full control over your tipple. Each IceQimo kit consists of --


One Thermal Isolator
One Ice Mold
Two Shaping Dividers - for 1/6 Wedges & 1/8 Pellets 
One Base Tray 


Different Shapes for Different Mix

■ Spheres - for Single Malts, Bourbons, and other sippers On The Rocks. Minimal contact area causes minimal dilution.



■ 1/6 Wedges - for Stirring & maintaining chill.



■ 1/8 Pellets - for Shaking & quick chilling.


Simple to Use
To make Clear Ice, simply insert the food-grade silicon mold into the custom thermal isolator, and fill water to the brim. Place in freezer, and in 14~18 hours, voila! Your drinks are ready for a refreshing upgrade.
To enhance user-convenience, a thoughtful Base Tray is included. The Base Tray employs an interlocking design, which easily combines, Lego-style, to hold multiple IceQimo together.
Practically, it helps keep your ice-making procedure spillage-free, and doubles as a holder for Sphere Ices after extraction -- so that you can make more ice for seconds : )

A tray in multiple way for holding your IceQimo & Sphere Ices !

This story began when I couldn’t find the swimwear I like - Some were not elegant, some too revealing some were made of the very strong and heavy fabric which was not very comfortable on the body. Thats why I decided to make swimwear by myself.

My idea was to make the new interpretation of retro swimwear and combine it with innovative fabric. The inspiration for the collection is italian movies of 50’s. Why retro? Because of it’s feminine lines, elegance and sophistication.
Gareth and Queen swimwear is minimalistic cut and interesting decorative elements. The beauty of geometry and shapes creates our design esthetics. We define our style as sophisticated sexuality. We want to create special athmosphere for you. We want you to feel special.
We use an innovative italian fabric specially created for professional sports. The fabric is very soft and light, it’s almost weightless - you don’t feel it on your body.
We are making a small collection, concentrating on the quality of every element - from cut and fit to fabric.
We found a team of talented people, we choose the best fabric, we made patterns and samples - we corrected them many times until we get perfect silhouette and fit, we found the factory in beautiful Barcelona.  Now we need your help to produce the first collection.

<li>Start/stop smartphone video recording</li>
<li>Post your vital parameters on Facebook </li>

<li>Start/Stop ambient audio recording</li>
<li>Refuse an incoming call</li>
<li>Mark your position on Facebook (or any other Social Network)</li>
</ul><p>Finally, with a triple button press you can:</p><ul>
<li>Request your caregiver assistance</li>
<li>Activate  a silenced call or hands-free call to a given number</li>
<li>Activate an immediate rescue / stalker procedure</li>
</ul><p><br/></p><p>Talking about the immediate rescue / stalker procedure, we are working to give you a cloud service able to make parallel phone calls to friends or parents numbers you set up, sending them a warning message with your exact local position.<br/></p><p>We understand perfectly that we cannot change the world and have a answer for every dangerous situation. Nevertheless, our aim is to provide a device and a service which could accelerate the rescue process, making an immediate call to the person you know could help you. This could make the difference between having just a bad time and a tragic event.</p><p></p>

FAQ

Cardiac arrest, is the abrupt loss of heart function in a person who may or may not have been diagnosed with heart disease. Each year, nearly 360,000 emergency medical services-assessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the US alone. Cardiac arrest is caused by abnormal, or irregular, heart rhythms (called arrhythmias). Death occurs within minutes after the heart stops.""Cardiac arrest strikes immediately and without warning""Sudden cardiac arrest may be caused by almost any known heart condition.""Cardiac arrest is reversible in most victims if treated within a few minutes if CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is performed and a defibrillator is used to shock the heart and restore a normal heart rhythm""Unfortunately victims of cardiac arrest fall unconscious and their chances of survival rely on quick reacting bystanders and their ability to rapidly recognize the problem and to instantly call for emergency medical services.""LifeTip is an advanced technology designed to make you feel good and give you and your loved ones peace-of-mind""Our device, tracks and analyzing your electrical heart activity (ECG), is able to promptly recognize deadly arrhythmias with an immediate call for emergency medical services while you are unconscious. Moreover it can prompt and guide people who are near you to start Cardiopulmonary resuscitation with appropriate messages.Furthermore, our device has the ability to analyze your ECG giving you the opportunity to seek medical advice in the case of atrial fibrillation (AF).""AF is the most common cause of ischemic stroke. Indeed most of people with atrial fibrillation are unaware of it and if left untreated can pose a great risk of stroke""
Our device is able to recognize this arrhythmia and prompt you to seek medical attention and dramatically lower your risk of stroke.Here are some real life stories of patients whom we asked to comment on LifeTip. The names are fictitious to protect their privacy.***Henry at just 24 years old had already won a number of cross country races. However, suddenly during one of his races he started to complain of palpitations in the chest area and fainted, falling to the ground. He subsequently underwent an electrophysiological study, which confirmed the presence of a conduction pathway. Through minor surgery the circuit has now been deleted and Henry resumes his promising athletic activities.""Using LifeTip whilst training or during my normal daily activities would have detected an abnormal heart beat earlier because of the ECG functionality""***Edward 45 has participated in many cycling events from a young age.  Suddenly he begin experiencing onsets of palpitations which forced him to cease all activities.An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Then he decided to seek treatment and eliminate the root of the arrhythmias with ablation. Now, Edward has been able to return to cycling and participates in races of many tens of kilometers without any disturbance what so ever.""If I had a LifeTip device the arrhythmias would have been perceived by the ECG function and message sent directly to my doctor""***Mike at the age of 36 visited the ER after a suffering another serious panic attack. With his blood pressure at 210/110 and heart rate close to 190.He was quickly treated for atrial fibrillation and his heart was reset using a defibrillator. He had absolutely no idea, he'd often felt a light discomfort in the chest area, but put down to stress, and a number of check-ups showed no signs of any underlying issues.""If I had had the opportunity to wear a LifeTip device the AF would have been picked-up and I could have seeked medical advice and avoided a very unnerving trip to the hospital""

LifeTip comes in two versions for both men & women with or without the ECG function.Gender, in terms of trend and style, can be a watershed. For this reason we prototyped two main versions: women and men.The women's version was designed to be smaller, extremely handy, stylish and perfectly complementary to your bra. The simple and secure magnetic clip ensures you to feel the device as part of the same bra.In order to satisfy women's fashion needs, we thought of 3 colours.On the other hand, the men's version has been specifically designed to be shown, hooked on a 
T-shirt. It is a little bigger than the women's version and available in 3
 different colours.

Really, only one button? Yes, as Apple taught us, there are a number of actions you can trigger with a single button. Here are just a few of the actions you can trigger from the device. But, we truly believe that other programmers can add more and more functionalities in the future.For example, with a single button press you can:
Take a picture 
Start/stop smartphone video recording
Post your vital parameters on Facebook 
With a double button press you can:
Set/Reset do-not disturb mode
Start/Stop ambient audio recording
Refuse an incoming call
Mark your position on Facebook (or any other Social Network)
Finally, with a triple button press you can:
Request your caregiver assistance
Activate  a silenced call or hands-free call to a given number
Activate an immediate rescue / stalker procedure
Talking about the immediate rescue / stalker procedure, we are working to give you a cloud service able to make parallel phone calls to friends or parents numbers you set up, sending them a warning message with your exact local position.We understand perfectly that we cannot change the world and have a answer for every dangerous situation. Nevertheless, our aim is to provide a device and a service which could accelerate the rescue process, making an immediate call to the person you know could help you. This could make the difference between having just a bad time and a tragic event.

A wearable device is nothing without an app. The LifeTip App is the bridge between your smartphone and your device. The App is running in background to receive commands and compute the data your body is generating.At any given moment you can start the LifeTip App and display your information, search for a particular time   in your daily life, display your ECG and, if you want, email your doctor the ECG.The LifeTip App lets you configure the button events: what to do when a single press is recognized, what to do for a double or a triple press. Also the app let’s you configure the behavior in case of a fall, crash or a severe heart problem.Running in the background, the app is able to elaborate the signals coming from the LifeTip Device and taking the appropriate decisions in fraction of a second. LifeTip App can be integrated in a complete cloud infrastructure, letting you store and analyze your data. With the cloud infrastructure the device potentially grows adding additional feature like:
Social Network integration
Illimitate data recording and storage
Vital signs comparison
IFTTT recipes
Mapping analysis
The cloud infrastructure and services will be available as a subscription. Indiegogo backers will receive a 1 year subscription included with the device.

For developers LifeTip is an ideal device for implementing in their software. The unique position in the center of the chest feeds the device with usable data on body position, recording any movement made directly from the center of the body. Steps duration and symmetricity (or eventually asymmetricity) of walking, body posture, on axis rotations, push-ups, sitting, standing, lie flat are just some of the information you can find in the device data feed.We will release the whole connection API as open source software, letting you develop any kind of mobile software with the LifeTip device. Don’t wait to order the pre-release software and accompanying devices to be ready when shipment starts.Moreover, the LifeTip is also a great device for your desktop/console game developing. Integrate your game with emotional feelings with happiness, fear, surprise reading your user at heart.Applying as a developer entitles you to receive pre-release devices for testing and developing and a priority shipment of your bunch of ready devices.

skin humidity, bodies with the final form factor.
To ensure a safe and
reliable prototype - since the initiation of the project we have been shadowed
by a cardiologist for continual advice and prototype testing.  
What we can assure you is
our determination, skill set and experience to provide you with the best
product we can.

<p>Our goal is to create 15 Color Direction Profile Apps and 1 Universal Color App that are smart-phone friendly. Your contribution to our indiegogo project will help fund our full spectrum of 16 color profile Apps which will be so beneficial for anyone who need to select colors for business and personal use.</p>
<p><strong>Why Does It Matter?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine being able to use color to look as vibrant and attractive as possible. Imagine seeing at a glance the exact shades and tints of color that make you look dazzling, elegant and relaxed. Each Color Directional App (15x) has specific colors that suit specific skin-tones/haircolor/eye color. The Universal Color App (1x) has colors that suit everyone.</p>
<p>When people are advised as to which one of these Color Apps work for their personal color pattern, they will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose clothes and accessories to suit their unique color pattern</li>
<li>Wear Color creatively and confidently</li>
<li>Save money by buying only those things that suit them</li>
<li>Project a healthy appearance (the colors enhance their skin-tone)</li>
<li>Coordinate their closets with ease, knowing that ‘this goes with that’</li>
<li>Be more resourceful with what they already have in their closets</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>The Convenience of having a Smart Phone Color App</strong></p>
<p>Your Color App is always with you (unless you leave your phone at home). A hard-copy color profile, although very tactile, eventually wears out and can be left in a store, or forgotten at home.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) When can I expect to see my perk packages?</strong></p>
<p><em>We will respond to your pledge immediately after the funding campaign ends by contacting you to honor your perk package. Please note that you will have access to the actual Apps (for pledges $20; $75 and $150) once they have been created and uploaded.</em></p>

The Purpose.
We’ve researched deeply into the sunglasses market and noticed its missing something big, FLOATING Sunglasses. There are many other companies out there that sell floating sunglasses, but they are extremely expensive, cheaply designed and have ""add-ons"" to make them float. Our new sunglasses are not only inexpensive, but are constructed to float within the frame itself. No Add-Ons necessary. A big bonus? They look really good on anyone and everyone.

The Frame.



Made -  from an ultra light NASA grade poly-carbonate plastic that is so light, you wont even notice yourself wearing them.

High gloss finish – Keeps your sunglasses in place when wet and don't wear down your face when drenched in sweat. 


Unique Design - We have studied the sunglasses market closely and noticed everyone has the same old ""wayfarer"" design, we wanted to offer something different, something fresh. 




Our Lenses


The lenses begins with a polarized poly-carbonate film (2), which is then blended to four additional layers. A gradiant tint film further reduces glare and acts as a one-way-mirror (3,4). Then finally, two scratch resistant films that keep everything protected and looking good (1,5).

The low end ones aren't smart devices at all, while the high end ones are ridiculously expensive. We believe it's possible to make a smart device that can be a little cheaper and a lot smarter!This project will also be presented on a few smart product-making competitions that we are participating in. By pledging even a dollar, you can help us win the competition! We will then be in a better position to seek venture funding to bring this product to market. So please give us your support!What can the smart medication dispenser do?1) Dispense the right medication each time based on configurations set and the time of day.2) Ability to operate independently of the mobile application. The user can set the reminder alarm and pill configuration on the dispenser itself.3) Has a buzzer and warning light to capture the user's attention when it is time to take the medication or when supplies are low.4) If used with a mobile application, the dispenser automatically and magically dispenses medication as the user approaches without user intervention.The Badass Dispenser PrototypeThis is just a proof of concept prototype. We will be engaging the services of a product designer to make this look absolutely cool!What can the smart medication tracker mobile application do?1) Configure the smart medication dispenser using an interactive graphical user interface.2) Quick treatment import / export function using QR codes.3) Easily view current treatment plan and exact dosage needed based on the time of the day.4) Reminder alarm (with snooze) when it is time to take medication.5) Text notifications to emergency contacts on missed dose or low supply.6) History tracking, which can be useful for doctors to monitor the user's progress as well as past treatment plans.7) Detailed information on medication in treatment plan powered by established medical databases (we do not always understand what each medication does to our body. I'm sure it's always good to know this).The ProblemCognitive impairment may play a major role in drug-related problems in the elderly, making it challenging to follow directions of prescribed medications. Other factors include the lack of care provider help with medication management; financial considerations that affect the purchase and regular use of medications. Poor medication adherence could critically endanger the patient and lead to unnecessary hospital visits, illness and even death. Research has shown that approximately 1 out of 10 hospital admissions are the result of the incorrect use of medications among elderly.The main customer need is medication compliance. In order for compliance to occur, medication needs to be more easily organized and administered. Our Smart Medication Dispensing System addresses this need.Existing ProductsManual Pill DispensersCost: $8 ( just pill boxes), $80 (with digital alarm - Really? $72 for an alarm?)The user has to sort the right dose on each refill (extremely mistake prone!)No notifications to mobile phone, which means if the user is far from device, the user is going to miss that dose (Dangerous!)Smart Pill DispensersCost:   $595 (E-Pill) , $600 / yr.  (Philips) [Not even available for sale]The user does not have to sort on each refillNo communication with mobile phone and no remote notifications or other perks that we are offering. So it's still not very smart, and costs more.Our SolutionWith the smart medication dispenser and tracker, the user is relieved from the hassle of carrying out the trivial and mundane task of assembling pills according to the prescribed treatment plan. You simply fill up each chamber with the right pill, and not worry about the prescription.Advanced remote notifications serve as an emergency red flags to caregivers or loved ones in case of missed doses due to unforeseen circumstances (such as an accident which causes the user to miss the dose). With the smart medication dispenser and tracker, you can be assured that your sick dependents are safe at all times.Tentative Specifications3 channel dispenser:

My brother and I are from the Los Angeles area and are avid watch enthusiasts who have an admiration for high-end watches.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>AN IDEA IS BORN</u></h3><p>With higher-end watches, we appreciated not only their elegant designs but also the mechanical movements inside. The common trait we found in these luxury watches was that they utilized automatic movements. In this day of technology we were inspired by watches that did not require batteries or electric charge, but instead were powered by the movement of the wearer.</p><p>As watch enthusiasts, we found that there were not many good choices if you wanted to buy a quality mechanical watch unless you wanted to pay four or even five figure sums of money. This idea and our love for watches, led us to creating a watch brand with four specific components:</p><ul>
<li>Great Design</li>
<li>Quality Build</li>
<li>Mechanical Movements</li>
<li>Affordable Price</li>
</ul><p>This is how Jermyn + Co. was born and what better way to present our first watch than through the wonderful Indiegogo community!</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><b>OUR FIRST WATCH</b></u></h3><p>The limited edition Hendrix Aviation Watch is the first product to be released by Jermyn + Co. This watch is our take on the popular ""Pilot"" style watch developed by many high-end brands.</p><p>The expected retail price of this watch is $249 USD. Considering that watches of this caliber can easily range upwards of $1,000 USD or more, we believe that this retail price is extremely competitive. The watch will be limited to 500 individually numbered units and will have the following detailed statistics:</p><p><u><strong>WATCH SPECIFICATIONS</strong></u></p><ul>

The street is most notably known for bespoke clothing that is made by some of the world's best tailors. ""Jermyn Street"" represents a timeless style where quality, details, and simplicity are paramount. We were inspired by this and have adopted these fundamental tenets in every design we will produce.</p><p>For reference, here is a link to the wikipedia article on ""Jermyn Street"" located in London, England: (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermyn_Street"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermyn_Street</a>)</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>WATCH DESIGN</u></h3><p>In creating an original design for our first watch, we decided to use the ""Pilot"" style watch as an inspiration. The Pilot style is an iconic watch type that has been utilized by many of the top watch brands.</p><p><u><strong>DIAL</strong></u></p><p>The triangle at the 12 o'clock symbolizes the Pilot watch. In our design it is a white triangle with a red outline. For our watch hands, we gave them a propellor look. The outer rim of the dial has markings for up to 1/5 of a second, and includes the 15, 30, &amp; 45 second marked intervals. The hashes that mark the hours, the seconds hand, and the triangle at 12 o'clock all have a luminescent material which emits a green glow for time reading in the dark. In addition, we have included a date window at 6 o'clock.</p><p><u><strong>CASE</strong></u></p><p>For the case we chose 316L Stainless Steel, which is commonly used by luxury watch brands. It is a strong durable steel and works extremely well for watch casings. Additionally, since this is a limited edition piece we took it a step further and coated the steel case in a matte black PVD finish. Both the front of the watch and the back are enclosed in Sapphire Crystal. The back of the watch showcases the mechanical movement and also has an outer rim engraving with watch specs, including the number of each individual piece out of 500 (i.e. 001/500, 002/500, etc).</p><p><u><strong>STRAP</strong></u></p><p>The watch strap is made from premium genuine leather and includes our logo on the back. The strap buckle is also coated in a matte black PVD finish to complement the look of the watch casing.</p><p><u><strong>CROWN</strong></u></p><p>The crown of the watch is coated in a matte black PVD finish and includes the ""+"" from our logo engraved in the center.</p><p>The following are pics from the watch design process:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469221261/vj4fwxlgsifacaa44dpw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Computer Aided Design (CAD) Rendering</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469221461/syjz0myhvajdcutsvgdk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Dial Design Schematics</i></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>WATCH BOX</u></strong></h3><p>Each Hendrix Aviation Watch comes with a black leather box.

</div></div>","(Note: We are no longer taking orders for this campaign.)BACKGROUNDWe are two brothers (Mark & Josh), and the project we present to you today is the first watch for our new lifestyle brand Jermyn + Co. My brother and I are from the Los Angeles area and are avid watch enthusiasts who have an admiration for high-end watches.AN IDEA IS BORNWith higher-end watches, we appreciated not only their elegant designs but also the mechanical movements inside. The common trait we found in these luxury watches was that they utilized automatic movements. In this day of technology we were inspired by watches that did not require batteries or electric charge, but instead were powered by the movement of the wearer.As watch enthusiasts, we found that there were not many good choices if you wanted to buy a quality mechanical watch unless you wanted to pay four or even five figure sums of money. This idea and our love for watches, led us to creating a watch brand with four specific components:
Great Design
Quality Build
Mechanical Movements
Affordable Price
This is how Jermyn + Co. was born and what better way to present our first watch than through the wonderful Indiegogo community!OUR FIRST WATCHThe limited edition Hendrix Aviation Watch is the first product to be released by Jermyn + Co. This watch is our take on the popular ""Pilot"" style watch developed by many high-end brands.The expected retail price of this watch is $249 USD. Considering that watches of this caliber can easily range upwards of $1,000 USD or more, we believe that this retail price is extremely competitive. The watch will be limited to 500 individually numbered units and will have the following detailed statistics:WATCH SPECIFICATIONS
MSRP: $249 USD
Case Diameter: 41mm
Case Thickness: 11mm
Case Material: 316L Stainless Steel (with Matte Black - PVD finish)

The street is most notably known for bespoke clothing that is made by some of the world's best tailors. ""Jermyn Street"" represents a timeless style where quality, details, and simplicity are paramount. We were inspired by this and have adopted these fundamental tenets in every design we will produce.For reference, here is a link to the wikipedia article on ""Jermyn Street"" located in London, England: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermyn_Street)WATCH DESIGNIn creating an original design for our first watch, we decided to use the ""Pilot"" style watch as an inspiration. The Pilot style is an iconic watch type that has been utilized by many of the top watch brands.DIALThe triangle at the 12 o'clock symbolizes the Pilot watch. In our design it is a white triangle with a red outline. For our watch hands, we gave them a propellor look. The outer rim of the dial has markings for up to 1/5 of a second, and includes the 15, 30, & 45 second marked intervals. The hashes that mark the hours, the seconds hand, and the triangle at 12 o'clock all have a luminescent material which emits a green glow for time reading in the dark. In addition, we have included a date window at 6 o'clock.CASEFor the case we chose 316L Stainless Steel, which is commonly used by luxury watch brands. It is a strong durable steel and works extremely well for watch casings. Additionally, since this is a limited edition piece we took it a step further and coated the steel case in a matte black PVD finish. Both the front of the watch and the back are enclosed in Sapphire Crystal. The back of the watch showcases the mechanical movement and also has an outer rim engraving with watch specs, including the number of each individual piece out of 500 (i.e. 001/500, 002/500, etc).STRAPThe watch strap is made from premium genuine leather and includes our logo on the back. The strap buckle is also coated in a matte black PVD finish to complement the look of the watch casing.CROWNThe crown of the watch is coated in a matte black PVD finish and includes the ""+"" from our logo engraved in the center.The following are pics from the watch design process:Computer Aided Design (CAD) RenderingDial Design SchematicsWATCH BOXEach Hendrix Aviation Watch comes with a black leather box. The box is crafted from premium leather and has the Jermyn + Co. logo on the outside. The inside of the box is plush and includes a pouch, Jermyn + Co. logo, and soft cushion insert to hold the watch. In addition, an outer cover with Jermyn + Co. logo is included to hold the black leather box when in storage.The following are pics showing the box design along with the prototype watch box and outer cover:Watch Box (CAD Rendering)Watch BoxWatch Box & Outer CoverWatch Box (Inside Outer Cover)

February-March: Production, Packaging and Shipping

Who Is Behind SOAK?
We’re two friends with a big vision of bringing an affordable, high-quality American made product that any woman can purchase and feel great in. That's genuine and we have chosen to launch with Kickstarter because we believe there are people out there that want that, too. 
Thank you to everybody that helped us launch this project:
Wes Hutchinson for providing us the rights to his song More than Today of his latest album All the Plans have Changed; Christian Carter for Producing and DIrecting our video; and Splashlight Studios, for graciously providing us with a set to film our video...
...and an even bigger Thank You to all of our supporters (if you haven’t yet, scroll up to the top of the page and click the green button!)",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>A Need for NavTags</h3>
<p>Roughly 100 million pairs of sunglasses are bought each year...and that's just in the United States alone! Take into account the millions of pairs of prescription eyeglasses and OTC readers as well, and you have a huge market of consumers who all share one probable fate. At one point they will lose their eyewear.</p>
<p>NavTags provides a simple solution for the person who owns a pair of sunglasses or other type of eyewear, and is tired of misplacing or losing them. NavTags will also differ from your standard tracking system, taking a more proactive approach. Instead of relying on tracking the location of an individual’s eyewear, NavTags will alert the user <i>before</i> their eyewear is too far gone. This approach can stop the problem of losing your eyewear before it even happens.</p>
<p>So, stop wasting time searching, and stop wasting your money replacing. Back NavTags today and never lose your eyewear again!</p>

<p>The duo behind NavTags development is a team of serial entrepreneurs who have launched ventures across multiple industries including publishing, finance, social media, aviation and more. Our team approached the problem of disappearing eyewear due to the widespread nature of leaving your eyewear behind and, well, because it has happen to them personally a little too often ;)</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>NavTags Partners</h3>
</div><div>
<p>To navigate software development, our team has been working with Chicago-based <a href=""http://eightbitstudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">8 Bit Studios</a> and <a href=""http://www.twistedtraces.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twisted Traces</a>. The two teams began working together in November of 2014 in order to sketch out a process to bring the NavTags technology to market. Over the course of two years, we have worked with a wide array of designers, programmers, client reps and tech experts at the firm to bring our vision to reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""http://eightbitstudios.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478973284/hqmwhpfupzc0wxizp0ul.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>For the past 8 years, 8 Bit has been helping organizations, individuals, and teams serve up high-quality ultra-modern applications for the mobile age. The firm focuses at the intersection of technology and human touch, orchestrating experiences that deliver the kind of value businesses are founded on. Their interdisciplinary team of designers, engineers, and leaders bring enthusiasm and expertise to solving problems and helping entrepreneurs and organizations navigate the modern mobile age.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.twistedtraces.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478973307/kyee93nyegagysrhjpdg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Brass Tax</h3>
<p>Here's why we're asking you for $50,000:</p>
<p><strong><u>Investment Part 1 - Software</u></strong></p>
<p>We're close to finalizing the NavTags app but need additional moneys to support the final stages of software and app development. The NavTags app will feature GPS location, a nifty separation alert, location reminders and a range finder, allowing you to track down your missing eyewear. Below is brief overview of ""how it works"":</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478440818/cjogv5rjjqmd3lhvpapv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Module works by sending a blue tooth signal to your phone. If the module is out of range of your phone, an alert is sent to your phone. Upon receiving alert, if you didn’t forget the glasses, you may choose to store the location of the glasses. When module breaks out of range, the geographic location is recorded in the app. When user returns to app, it will display the last known geographic location of where glasses are stored.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Investment Part 2 - Production</strong></u></p>
<p>Your backing of NavTags will also help secure the initial materials for the build. Obviously if we want to sell NavTags we need to be able to make them! While we have a final prototype in place we need money to scale production of the final design.</p>
<p>The NavTags module is the world's smallest geo locator and offers a simplistic, minimal design. Roughly the diameter of a nickel, your NavTag will allow you to keep track of your eyewear without anyone (even you!) knowing they're there.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478970443/ky7dol6csrcpjzguqnim.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3><strong>Speaking of Nickels, Let's Take The Dime Tour</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478971341/xgjchbqdvnivvwcblbad.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The NavTags app shows up on your phone’s home screen. Press on the icon to open app.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The welcome page gets you started and walks you through the instructions and explains how to properly place the module on your eyewear.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> The add glasses page allows you to personalize your NavTags experience.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The personalization page gives a choice of glasses icons to associate with your own glasses and asks for a name, so that the glasses can be properly tagged. You can also control the push notifications and searching sounds.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478972110/ikehljdvuonegkv67y0p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> The home page recognizes your glasses icon. At the bottom of the page is a reminder of your last stored location of the glasses for quick and easy reference. If you wish to search for your glasses, you’d press the TAP TO FIND icon at the bottom of the My Glasses circle.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> If your eyewear are within 10 feet of your phone, a Range Finder graphic on the top of the My Glasses page will show up in green color. At the bottom of the page, it will show the glasses exact location based upon the BLE chip and the geo-locating technology on your phone.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> As you move away from your eyewear the color on the Range Finder changes to reflect the distance travelled. While green signifies the closest range, yellow signifies a range 10 to 25 feet, orange tells you when the module is 25 to 50 feet away, and red signifies the glasses are more than 50 feet from your phone.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> When the first range criterion is broken (green to yellow) a warning comes up on your phone. This warning can be an instant reminder to return to your glasses or you can use the technology to remind yourself where you have stored the glasses.</p>

<h3>Hardware Timeline &amp; Status</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>November 2014:</strong> After months of internal discussions, the team engaged the services of 8 Bit Studios to turn the NavTags idea into a reality.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479055379/j6d5e0cujuss2bu2lkue.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1) January 2015:</strong> Initial prototypes of the NavTags module were based on off-the-shelf tech solutions with no hardware modifications.</p>
<p><strong>2) Summer 2015:</strong> As we were able to move to our own chip design, there was an immediate tradoff concern regarding size and cost. We were able to bring down the cost by building our own design, but the need for sufficient power forced us to increase size. </p>
<p><strong>3) Winter 2015:</strong> We were able to bring down the overall footprint in terms of size, but power questions lingered</p>
<p><strong>4) Spring 2016:</strong> The experts were finally able to get the power issue under control, but as more testing was conducted signal strength and interference became an issue</p>
<p><strong>5) Fall 2016:</strong> Future iterations were able to solve the interference issues by making adjustments to the board itself.</p>
<p><strong>Today:</strong> After more than two years of development, we've put a ton of work into this effort, but we're still a few steps away from a market launch. At this point we need outside help from a crowdfunding campaign in order to finalize production and go-to-market.</p>
<p><strong>Summer 2017:</strong> NavTags will be finalized, produced and ready for customer delivery.</p>

<h3>The Impact of Your Contribution</h3>
<p>Revolutionizing the way tracking systems work. The NavTags module will turn searching technology on its head. While existing systems focus on finding an item that has been lost or misplaced, NavTags revolutionizes this process by focusing on tracking items <i><strong>BEFORE</strong></i> they are misplaced.</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping to develop the smallest geo location device in history (insert golf clap here).</li>
<li>Helping people save hundreds of dollars per year in lost eyewear replacement</li>
<li>Saving users countless hours spent searching for eyewear</li>
<li>Alleviating headaches related to lost eyewear</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with the development of any new technology there are risks related to both the software and hardware. In order to ensure the best performance related to software, the group has retained the services of a leading software developer, Chicago-based 8 Bit Studios. The developer has been working on software development related to NavTags for over 18 months. This process has resulted in more than 30 iterations of software in order to try to achieve the best user experience. For hardware, the team has retained the services of Twisted Traces, a leading expert on the consultation and fabrication of hardware technology. In addition, the NavTags team has retained an independent hardware consultant in order to ensure that components used are appropriate for the intended use.</p>
<p>The hardware and software team are working together to finalize a go-to-market version of the technology that tackles the problem of losing an individual’s eyewear. Funds raised through the crowdfunding campaign will go to further development and refinement as well as real world stress testing to ensure the best possible performance.</p>
<p>Individual product performance will vary based upon signal strength, reception, and battery power. While efforts have been made to ensure a universal product experience, performance may vary based on location.</p>

Over the course of two years, we have worked with a wide array of designers, programmers, client reps and tech experts at the firm to bring our vision to reality.
 

For the past 8 years, 8 Bit has been helping organizations, individuals, and teams serve up high-quality ultra-modern applications for the mobile age. The firm focuses at the intersection of technology and human touch, orchestrating experiences that deliver the kind of value businesses are founded on. Their interdisciplinary team of designers, engineers, and leaders bring enthusiasm and expertise to solving problems and helping entrepreneurs and organizations navigate the modern mobile age.
 

On the hardware front, the team has been working with Twisted Traces. Metro Chicago-based Twisted Traces is a leader in the printed circuit board manufacturing industry, offering unmatched benefits on three fronts: quality, cost, and on-time delivery. As a printed circuit board manufacturer on the cutting edge of innovation, the firm’s 30 years of PCB manufacturing experience is key to bringing ideas to reality.
Twisted Traces has proven helpful through more than a dozen design iterations and new builds. In addition to manufacturing prowess, the firm has been a key partner on the consulting front, highlighting new hardware options that can make the NavTags module a leader in terms of size, performance, and reliability.
 
The Brass Tax
Here's why we're asking you for $50,000:
Investment Part 1 - Software
We're close to finalizing the NavTags app but need additional moneys to support the final stages of software and app development. The NavTags app will feature GPS location, a nifty separation alert, location reminders and a range finder, allowing you to track down your missing eyewear. Below is brief overview of ""how it works"":

 
The Module works by sending a blue tooth signal to your phone. If the module is out of range of your phone, an alert is sent to your phone. Upon receiving alert, if you didn’t forget the glasses, you may choose to store the location of the glasses. When module breaks out of range, the geographic location is recorded in the app. When user returns to app, it will display the last known geographic location of where glasses are stored.
 
Investment Part 2 - Production
Your backing of NavTags will also help secure the initial materials for the build. Obviously if we want to sell NavTags we need to be able to make them! While we have a final prototype in place we need money to scale production of the final design.
The NavTags module is the world's smallest geo locator and offers a simplistic, minimal design. Roughly the diameter of a nickel, your NavTag will allow you to keep track of your eyewear without anyone (even you!) knowing they're there.

*Go to our photo gallery for a complete progression of the NavTags module and design explorataion.
 
Speaking of Nickels, Let's Take The Dime Tour

1. The NavTags app shows up on your phone’s home screen. Press on the icon to open app.
2. The welcome page gets you started and walks you through the instructions and explains how to properly place the module on your eyewear.
3. The add glasses page allows you to personalize your NavTags experience.
4. The personalization page gives a choice of glasses icons to associate with your own glasses and asks for a name, so that the glasses can be properly tagged. You can also control the push notifications and searching sounds.

 
5. The home page recognizes your glasses icon. At the bottom of the page is a reminder of your last stored location of the glasses for quick and easy reference. If you wish to search for your glasses, you’d press the TAP TO FIND icon at the bottom of the My Glasses circle.
6. If your eyewear are within 10 feet of your phone, a Range Finder graphic on the top of the My Glasses page will show up in green color. At the bottom of the page, it will show the glasses exact location based upon the BLE chip and the geo-locating technology on your phone.
7. As you move away from your eyewear the color on the Range Finder changes to reflect the distance travelled. While green signifies the closest range, yellow signifies a range 10 to 25 feet, orange tells you when the module is 25 to 50 feet away, and red signifies the glasses are more than 50 feet from your phone.
8. When the first range criterion is broken (green to yellow) a warning comes up on your phone. This warning can be an instant reminder to return to your glasses or you can use the technology to remind yourself where you have stored the glasses.

 
Hardware Timeline & Status
 
November 2014: After months of internal discussions, the team engaged the services of 8 Bit Studios to turn the NavTags idea into a reality.

 
1) January 2015: Initial prototypes of the NavTags module were based on off-the-shelf tech solutions with no hardware modifications.
2) Summer 2015: As we were able to move to our own chip design, there was an immediate tradoff concern regarding size and cost. We were able to bring down the cost by building our own design, but the need for sufficient power forced us to increase size. 
3) Winter 2015: We were able to bring down the overall footprint in terms of size, but power questions lingered
4) Spring 2016: The experts were finally able to get the power issue under control, but as more testing was conducted signal strength and interference became an issue
5) Fall 2016: Future iterations were able to solve the interference issues by making adjustments to the board itself.
Today: After more than two years of development, we've put a ton of work into this effort, but we're still a few steps away from a market launch. At this point we need outside help from a crowdfunding campaign in order to finalize production and go-to-market.
Summer 2017: NavTags will be finalized, produced and ready for customer delivery.
*Go to our photo gallery for a complete progression of the NavTags module and design exploration.
 
The Impact of Your Contribution
Revolutionizing the way tracking systems work. The NavTags module will turn searching technology on its head. While existing systems focus on finding an item that has been lost or misplaced, NavTags revolutionizes this process by focusing on tracking items BEFORE they are misplaced.

Helping to develop the smallest geo location device in history (insert golf clap here).
Helping people save hundreds of dollars per year in lost eyewear replacement
Saving users countless hours spent searching for eyewear
Alleviating headaches related to lost eyewear


 
Risks & Challenges
As with the development of any new technology there are risks related to both the software and hardware. In order to ensure the best performance related to software, the group has retained the services of a leading software developer, Chicago-based 8 Bit Studios. The developer has been working on software development related to NavTags for over 18 months. This process has resulted in more than 30 iterations of software in order to try to achieve the best user experience. For hardware, the team has retained the services of Twisted Traces, a leading expert on the consultation and fabrication of hardware technology. In addition, the NavTags team has retained an independent hardware consultant in order to ensure that components used are appropriate for the intended use.
The hardware and software team are working together to finalize a go-to-market version of the technology that tackles the problem of losing an individual’s eyewear. Funds raised through the crowdfunding campaign will go to further development and refinement as well as real world stress testing to ensure the best possible performance.
Individual product performance will vary based upon signal strength, reception, and battery power. While efforts have been made to ensure a universal product experience, performance may vary based on location.

<p>As is the case with most projects of this type, there are risks and challenges associated with completion.

<p>Your support and trust mean a lot to me, and I don't want to let you down. If problems should arise, I won't spend days feeling sorry for myself or wasting my energy on negativity. Instead, I will immediately get to work finding an alternate solution. One advantage of having a brain that is constantly operating in ""inventor mode"" (see my bio above) is that I generally have a back up plan. In fact, I've learned that sometimes the alternate solution ends up being better than the original!</p>

Your support and trust mean a lot to me, and I don't want to let you down. If problems should arise, I won't spend days feeling sorry for myself or wasting my energy on negativity. Instead, I will immediately get to work finding an alternate solution. One advantage of having a brain that is constantly operating in ""inventor mode"" (see my bio above) is that I generally have a back up plan. In fact, I've learned that sometimes the alternate solution ends up being better than the original!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

Solklar is a product development project within smartwear. Our mission is to enable adventures through access to green energy while on the move. We use the sun to make outdoor life independent of battery life by harnessing energy to charge your devices. So that you can focus on getting the most out of life. 
Investor proposal    
We target ambitious outdoors people who wish to tread lightly on our planet and welcome innovative products that makes their lives easier. We are looking for investments to fund a prototype and test our first product before heading into production and market launch. We ask for 5400 EUR to cover materials, production, shipment and fees, and keep costs low by tapping into the expertise and connections within fashion, marketing, design and entrepreneurship of our team.
As a supporter you enable our prototype development to test our product before we enter market in our projected forecast. In extension to our financial pledge we welcome product feedback and test subjects during the prototyping phase. We also welcome interested parties for future collaborations within the outdoors and design segments of online business.
Product
Problem       Poor battery capacity on smartphones limits extended outdoor use and leaves many of the tools provided useless, for example GPS, planning apps, internet searches, camera and social connections. The average user in our target group currently use pre-charged battery packs to extend their smart devices functionality during outdoor activities, relying on continuous recharging. Some have found portable solar panels to better fit their needs. These solutions are however designed to power up during moments of rest, or to be attached to other equipment, which limits their options and freedom of movement by lack of versatility. 
Solution       By using solar smartwear, our customers get access to clean energy while on the move, lessen their dependence on energy infrastructure on their more ambitious quests and enable their smart devices to fit their intended purposes.
Our vest is designed for versatility and can be worn by either sex, adjustable in size, or be attached to additional equipments such as backpacks. With comfort and freedom of movement in mind, the vest is also lightweight and waterproof, fabricated out of carefully chosen textiles matched with efficient and removable solar panels for easy maintenance.
We are currently looking at developments in solar tech, and the minimum criteria for our product is to substitute a standard wall charger with sun exposure.
           
Product use        The vest is ideal for adventurous trips and is well suited for a variety of activities; cycling, kayaking, hiking or alpine sports, where sun exposure is plentiful and energy outlets scarce.
By wearing the vest, or attaching it to any equipment, it is possible to substitute or complement the use of battery packs with a clean source of energy. Market information
Brand positioning    Although battery packs or power banks offer extended free time in nature, and is growing in demand on the global market, they're fundamentally designed to rely on energy outlets. In most cases this also implies that dirty energy is fuelling the natural refuge, causing a discord of values in our consumer.
Foldable solar panels are great options but not as versatile as our vest. They require mounting that is less applicable to situations where the user would rather go with minimal packing, such as during running.Another option is solar panel equipped backpacks which share the same faults and come with additional complications when competing with optimized backpacks. We simply provide the same solution in a more user friendly format. 
Execution plan   
We look to prototype and test our design and features, as well as selecting the right suppliers for our production setup. If the prototype development and testing is successful we will launch a second campaign for raising startup capital and cover production and marketing expenses. 
Risk analysis      
In order to reach market, we need funding to prototype, develop and set up our supply chain. To mitigate risks of investments we aim to raise money for a prototype as a first step, to refine and test our design in the intended settings.

The company specifically seeks to provide those who want to develop their businesses with various partnerships and support services, such as bookkeeping, accounting, administration, marketing, brand and business development, legal, and editing services. Anomalous Partners also promotes relations between black-owned businesses, their allies in the west, and African businesses in the diaspora.</p><p>Askia Christian, President of Anomalous Partners is spearheading the partnership with Super Ghost Distributions, a US-based distributor, to raise capital to expand Hero Collections, an apparel company based out of Accra, Ghana</p><p> </p><p><strong>HERO DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>The first African-based company we are promoting is Hero Collections. It is owned and operated by Jamez Attiogbe, a young Ghanaian designer with superhero and social justice passions very similar to our own. His vision is to 1) Africanize well known international superheroes, 2) Internationalize historic African heroes, and then use the platform he has created to 3) Recognize and humanize everyday African heroes, including descendants of the diaspora all over the world. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613446639/ctthjldwkpruj1f8wkw2.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Hero Collections was founded in 2014, via the flagship store in Accra, Ghana. Soon after development, the company was boosted into international sales through a franchise opportunity at the Ghana airport. Since then, growth stagnated and James began thinking about developing an online presence. Noting that his local economic community was strangulated in the market, due to existing international trade policy and devastating stereotypes regarding African nations (ie: African prince scam chain letters), he knew he had to be proactive.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613448279/bwuekagzx4vsx4qtoqji.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Upon a chance meeting with Khalila Fordham, one of the Anomalous Partners founders, in January of 2020, James took the opportunity to form a US partnership through Super Ghost Distributions to promote and distribute his products. He realized the social capital byproduct of an equitable western partnership would advance his local community and economy.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to a US partnership with SuperGhost, he also wanted to give back to his local community through the various higher education institutions in the Accra area. James planned to launch his Campus Heroes Initiative in 2020. The intention was to provide opportunities for local youth to volunteer in their local communities, as well as develop field experience in the textile and trade industries, while earning a college degree. However, these plans were thwarted by the devastation of COVID-19, as trade opportunities waned.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613448401/jq2ovd4e9renmvktvu31.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>About the Campaign</strong></p><p><strong>THE CAMPAIGN &amp; WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT</strong></p><p>Our goal is to raise funds for the growth and sustainability of Hero Collections. Locally, in Ghana, Hero Collections is in need of numerous upgrades for production and manufacturing spaces. We also need funds for a mobile shop, as the local economy cannot yet respond to an online-based presence. We hope to raise capital to ensure that Hero Collections is robust enough to handle online orders from all over the world.

The company specifically seeks to provide those who want to develop their businesses with various partnerships and support services, such as bookkeeping, accounting, administration, marketing, brand and business development, legal, and editing services. Anomalous Partners also promotes relations between black-owned businesses, their allies in the west, and African businesses in the diaspora.Askia Christian, President of Anomalous Partners is spearheading the partnership with Super Ghost Distributions, a US-based distributor, to raise capital to expand Hero Collections, an apparel company based out of Accra, Ghana HERO DESCRIPTIONThe first African-based company we are promoting is Hero Collections. It is owned and operated by Jamez Attiogbe, a young Ghanaian designer with superhero and social justice passions very similar to our own. His vision is to 1) Africanize well known international superheroes, 2) Internationalize historic African heroes, and then use the platform he has created to 3) Recognize and humanize everyday African heroes, including descendants of the diaspora all over the world.  Hero Collections was founded in 2014, via the flagship store in Accra, Ghana. Soon after development, the company was boosted into international sales through a franchise opportunity at the Ghana airport. Since then, growth stagnated and James began thinking about developing an online presence. Noting that his local economic community was strangulated in the market, due to existing international trade policy and devastating stereotypes regarding African nations (ie: African prince scam chain letters), he knew he had to be proactive. Upon a chance meeting with Khalila Fordham, one of the Anomalous Partners founders, in January of 2020, James took the opportunity to form a US partnership through Super Ghost Distributions to promote and distribute his products. He realized the social capital byproduct of an equitable western partnership would advance his local community and economy. In addition to a US partnership with SuperGhost, he also wanted to give back to his local community through the various higher education institutions in the Accra area. James planned to launch his Campus Heroes Initiative in 2020. The intention was to provide opportunities for local youth to volunteer in their local communities, as well as develop field experience in the textile and trade industries, while earning a college degree. However, these plans were thwarted by the devastation of COVID-19, as trade opportunities waned. About the CampaignTHE CAMPAIGN & WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENTOur goal is to raise funds for the growth and sustainability of Hero Collections. Locally, in Ghana, Hero Collections is in need of numerous upgrades for production and manufacturing spaces. We also need funds for a mobile shop, as the local economy cannot yet respond to an online-based presence. We hope to raise capital to ensure that Hero Collections is robust enough to handle online orders from all over the world. With the projected boost in online sales, there’s an urgent need to hire and train additional staff as well as provide equitable pay and accommodations for team members.  Too often, trade deals with African-based companies lead to an increase in the price of goods in a way that inequitably benefits the western based partner, while leaving the African-based partner with less income and profit. The hope of Anomalous Partners and SuperGhost, as US-based partners of companies like Hero Collections, is to make these exchanges in such a way that it improves the international trade expectations of African-based companies. Our goal is to create as many opportunities as possible for a corresponding increase in quality of life for African-based companies as their sales increase, modeling the policies of the World Fair Trade Organization. WHAT WE NEED:We are asking for $25,000 to help Hero Collections buy resources to prepare the brand to launch into an international market. We need: 
Larger manufacturing space. The current space is a 12 x 12 feet shed that is not fully enclosed. It has a roof and walls, but allows drafts and mosquitos.
Modern sewing machines, as Hero Collections is currently using dated machines.
Modern screen printing machine
Industrial iron
Office computers and printer
Material and fabric to expand inventory for international launch.
Transportation truck for developing products in the local region. 
EXTENDED GOAL:

Hero Collections would like to buy and remodel space to accommodate the growing training staff.

<p><strong>THE STORY</strong></p>
<p>The story behind RÔKA is one of passion and entrepreneurship. We started out with a simple idea of creating beautiful accessories with the ambition to do our part in improving the world around us. We don't target men or women but rather people sharing our idea of how things should work. It IS possible to create pieces out of some of the finest materials our world has to offer in a way that not only doesn't hurt our environment but also helps people in need. This is why we work with charities and dedicate each collection to a specific charity. It is also why we are very selective with the materials we use in order to avoiding negative impact on the environment and the people we work with.<br/>The HÔMAGE collection has been dedicated to the amazing Swedish non-profit Föreningen Storasyster (The Big Sister Association) and their work to help people exposed to sexual abuse. </p>
<p>(Read more about Föreningen Storasyster and why we've asked them to be paired with the HÔMAGE collection below under 'Awareness' )<br/><br/>We have never been in this business to maximize our profits or for the sake of money. We want to feed our passion for creating and doing the right thing and to be able to make a living out of that is more than enough for us. Our passion is as strong as it is genuine and anyone willing to join us on this journey is more than welcome to do so. <br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please reach out to us. We are always interested to talk with like minded people. You'll find our contact information under 'Contact' on our website. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.rokastonewear.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rokastonewear.com</a></p>
<p><strong>THE DESIGN</strong></p>
<p>At first sight, The Hômage collection appears to differ wildly from the prior RÔKA collections. No stone or minerals, no link and no beaded structure. When taking a closer look however, one will discover several similarities that clearly states the RÔKA heritage of this collection. </p>
<p>First off, you'll notice that the shape of the solid silver band is the same as the RÔKA tab in our beaded pieces. We simply extended the tab and had it envelop the wrist almost completly. The bracelet is a solid 925 Sterling Silver piece made from 100% reused materials. </p>
<p>Close to the end of the band is the signature off-set RÔKA engraving which is done by hand. Following the engraving is a row of five bands. Each one representing one of the five years RÔKA has been in existence. A single 'Ô' is engraved on the opposite side and this is the sub-brand marking our new style of design. <br/>Taking a look in the inside of the band you will find four stamps. One marks the guarantee of the silver purity of 92,5% pure silver (industry standard). Following that is the stamp for year of production (2018). Next up is the stamp guaranteeing that the piece is made in Stockholm, Sweden. And lastly is the RÔKA Stone Wear stamp which marks our status as certified jewelry producer. </p>
<p>The design has been processed for nearly a year and a half. Pen put to paper and paper put to our talented smith who sculpted to original and on through the process until we reached a result that we are happy with. It has been a slow but steady development which has been needed in order to reach the level of quality we always aim for.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE QUALITY</strong></p>
<p>We had a clear vision from the start with The Hômage, we would be using nothing but Swedish materials and work exclusively with Swedish partners. The 925 Sterling Silver is reused and comes from Swedish mines. We are having less of an environmental impact as no global shipments are required and no new silver ore needs to be mined for our purposes as we reuse silver from old jewlery, cutlery, tools etc. This way we can minimize our Co2 emissions and at the same time have complete and total control over the silver quality as well as the standards for people employed by our partners. </p>
<p>The boxing is made entirely out of Swedish wood that is grown responsibly and in a sustainable way. The cases are cut to size and then put together by hand using no glue or resin. </p>
<p>Every single piece of material and every single individual that has worked on this collection comes from Sweden. Simply put: not a single component has crossed Swedish borders. </p>
<p>This is how we can guarantee the highest possible quality and at the same time make sure that our pieces are produced in a responsible and sustainable way in regards to both people and the environment. Of this we are incredibly proud.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE AWARENESS</strong></p>
<p>As all RÔKA collections The HÔMAGE is connected to a charity we care deeply about. Föreningen Storasyster is a Swedish non-profit working to help people exposed to sexual abuse. They support their clients with everything from therapy to legal advice. Sadly, the need for non-profits like Föreningen Storasyster is profound and we want to help decrease that need. 10% of the profits of The HÔMAGE collection are donated to Föreningen Storasyster in order to help them do their important and though job. </p>

<p>Are you tired of losing things? Do you wish there was a neckwear option that was not only stylish but also trackable?</p>
<p>Introducing the world’s first location-tracking necktie: the Little Colonel Locator. It combines fashionable neckwear with the latest in location-tracking technology. Now you can find anyone or anything that’s wearing this tie—as long as they’re within 100 feet of your smartphone. And if they’re farther away than that, it will tell you where they were last in range. </p>
<p>Because it’s a clip-on, you can attach it to lots of things. However, the tie is not recommended as a way to track children, because outside of 100 feet it will not provide live-tracking updates like a GPS device does. That said, they’ll still look pretty cool wearing the tie.</p>

Because it’s a clip-on, you can attach it to lots of things. However, the tie is not recommended as a way to track children, because outside of 100 feet it will not provide live-tracking updates like a GPS device does. That said, they’ll still look pretty cool wearing the tie.

 

 

 

 

Tie width: 5.7"" from bow end to bow end
Tie technology: Integrated Bluetooth tracking device and red flashing light with clip-on tech
Tie details: Clip-on, pocket in the back of tie to access the integrated Bluetooth technology

 

 
100 feet trackable range from your smartphone

Use the Bluetooth tracker's smartphone app to find your tie

However every years  hundreds of expert cyclists and cyclotourists have accidents due to road hazards, unexpected glares, tiredness, looking at the phone or thousands of other distractions that can occur in real time. When cycling it’s a matter of a second for a good a ride to turn bad.</p><p>Byxee will never get tired,it will never became distracted. Its all purpose is to scan the road ahead at all time. Byxee is design to be a reliable third eye for cyclists on the road. However, this device won’t substitute cyclist’s allertness which is the foundation of a safe ride. </p><p>The bottom line is Byxee makes your ride safer when the second matter the most. </p><p><b>Why is Byxee an active safety device?</b></p><p>Active safety devices aim to avoid accidents, this is the case for example of all those devices that increase cyclist’s exposure (lights, reflectors, high visibility vests). On the contrary, passive safety refers to features that help reduce the effects of an accident, such as helmets and other personal protection guards. </p><p>Byxee introduces an innovative system to support both active and passive safety devices in collision avoidance. Thanks to its artificial intelligence Byxee detects road hazards before a cyclist get there so it allows him/her to make adjustements in real time to avoid the danger. </p><p><br/></p><p><b><u>#How to use Byxee</u></b></p><p><b>Where and when can Byxee be used?</b></p><p>Around 80% of cycling accidents occur in daylight. (August, 2014 - The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents). This is the reason why Byxee is optimized to be used on tarmac roads in daylight.</p><p><b>How does Byxee work when I am riding among a group of other riders? Will it detect them as obstacles? </b></p><p>Byxee only scans what happens ahead a bycicle. This means it will detect only the road ahead and it will not make any noise or alarm when you enter in and exit from a peloton bunch.  Byxee won’t annoy you with unsolicited warnings. </p><p><b>How does Byxee work in a long bumpy road? Will it keep on beeping? </b></p><p>No, it won’t. Thanks to its intelligent algorithm, Byxee will alert you only at the beginnig of a bumpy road and it will no keep on beeping. </p><p><b>How does it operate on road turns?</b></p><p>Within the visible agle of the device, prospective dangers are detected and notified. In the case road turns do not give the appropriate visibility Byxee will notify you anyway with a beep. </p><p><br/></p><p><b><u>#Miscellaneous</u></b></p><p><b>Where does the design come from? How did you work out the aerodynamics? </b></p><p>Our inspiration to create Byxee’s design comes from Lamborghini’s sports cars. We conceived a pleasant unique and slender shape. We worked out the aerodynamics by testing the device on specialized softwares that simulate the exact same conditions of wind tunnels.  </p><p><b>Are there any similar device on the market  ?</b></p><p>On the market you can find some device able to chart the road and alert you through a GPS system on road irregularities recorded beforehand. The difference between those devices and Byxee is that the formers need somebody to record the road earlier, that is to say sobody need to hit a fixed obstacle in order to be charted. Moreover, no matter how use are those devices, they will never be able to detect any unexpected, temporary or moving obstacle such as a pedastrian crossing the street or an object falling down on the road. On the contrary Byxee scans the road ahead in real time using an intelligent vision system. </p><p><b>Why nobody else made it before?</b></p><p>Detecting obsatcles with a vision system needs a lot of calculating capacity, a lot of data storage and a lot of electric power. So far, similar systems have been used only on cars due to their wide size and the amount of electric power needed. Therefore our challenge was to solve all these problems, to make a device small enough to be put on any bycicle handlebar and to create a tiny long lasting battery. It took us two years of reserach and testing to design a brand new scanning system (B.L.R.S. Byxee Linear Road Scanner) and an unique intelligent algorithm (B.H.D.S. Byxee Hazard Detect System) that requires minimal calculating capacity. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432536959/gtdqozhghtbhbpyejqml.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p></div>","What your contribution meansAs a start-up company we have worked hard to increase cyclists' safety and performance.

The battery charge level will be displayed for a 5-second period when the device is powered on.  You can charge battery by a USB standard port.Does Byxee come in different colors?During the launch phase Byxee will be available only in a black or white plastic material and in a transparent limited edition. However, if we will reach $165,000 we will be able to produce Byxee in amazing colors!Does Byxee take pictures or video?No, Byxee does not record video and it does not take pictures.  Its all purpose is to scan the road.#ShippingHow much is the shipping cost? Please add $25 for shipping in USA, Canada or Europe. This cost has to be included during the contribution: once you’ve clicked on “Contribute now” and chosen your pack, add $25 on your pledge. Add $35 if you live in the rest of the world.How can I add shipping costs after my contribution?If you forgot to add the shipping costs during your contribution, don't worry. Just add a new contribution of $25 (USA, Canada, Europe) or $35 (rest of the world) without perk, and we will update your account.Why do I need Byxee?Cyclists can certainly trust their eyes and experience. However every years  hundreds of expert cyclists and cyclotourists have accidents due to road hazards, unexpected glares, tiredness, looking at the phone or thousands of other distractions that can occur in real time. When cycling it’s a matter of a second for a good a ride to turn bad.Byxee will never get tired,it will never became distracted. Its all purpose is to scan the road ahead at all time. Byxee is design to be a reliable third eye for cyclists on the road. However, this device won’t substitute cyclist’s allertness which is the foundation of a safe ride. The bottom line is Byxee makes your ride safer when the second matter the most. Why is Byxee an active safety device?Active safety devices aim to avoid accidents, this is the case for example of all those devices that increase cyclist’s exposure (lights, reflectors, high visibility vests). On the contrary, passive safety refers to features that help reduce the effects of an accident, such as helmets and other personal protection guards. Byxee introduces an innovative system to support both active and passive safety devices in collision avoidance. Thanks to its artificial intelligence Byxee detects road hazards before a cyclist get there so it allows him/her to make adjustements in real time to avoid the danger. #How to use ByxeeWhere and when can Byxee be used?Around 80% of cycling accidents occur in daylight. (August, 2014 - The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents). This is the reason why Byxee is optimized to be used on tarmac roads in daylight.How does Byxee work when I am riding among a group of other riders? Will it detect them as obstacles? Byxee only scans what happens ahead a bycicle. This means it will detect only the road ahead and it will not make any noise or alarm when you enter in and exit from a peloton bunch.  Byxee won’t annoy you with unsolicited warnings. How does Byxee work in a long bumpy road? Will it keep on beeping? No, it won’t. Thanks to its intelligent algorithm, Byxee will alert you only at the beginnig of a bumpy road and it will no keep on beeping. How does it operate on road turns?Within the visible agle of the device, prospective dangers are detected and notified. In the case road turns do not give the appropriate visibility Byxee will notify you anyway with a beep. #MiscellaneousWhere does the design come from? How did you work out the aerodynamics? Our inspiration to create Byxee’s design comes from Lamborghini’s sports cars. We conceived a pleasant unique and slender shape. We worked out the aerodynamics by testing the device on specialized softwares that simulate the exact same conditions of wind tunnels.  Are there any similar device on the market  ?On the market you can find some device able to chart the road and alert you through a GPS system on road irregularities recorded beforehand. The difference between those devices and Byxee is that the formers need somebody to record the road earlier, that is to say sobody need to hit a fixed obstacle in order to be charted. Moreover, no matter how use are those devices, they will never be able to detect any unexpected, temporary or moving obstacle such as a pedastrian crossing the street or an object falling down on the road. On the contrary Byxee scans the road ahead in real time using an intelligent vision system. Why nobody else made it before?Detecting obsatcles with a vision system needs a lot of calculating capacity, a lot of data storage and a lot of electric power. So far, similar systems have been used only on cars due to their wide size and the amount of electric power needed. Therefore our challenge was to solve all these problems, to make a device small enough to be put on any bycicle handlebar and to create a tiny long lasting battery. It took us two years of reserach and testing to design a brand new scanning system (B.L.R.S. Byxee Linear Road Scanner) and an unique intelligent algorithm (B.H.D.S. Byxee Hazard Detect System) that requires minimal calculating capacity.",43.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We all have a passion and ours revolves around watches. In an age where technology and sleek design seems to have become more prevalent, we still strive for that classic and practical look. This project started out as a vision to create a stylish, timeless and quintessentially English chronograph. A timepiece should be passed from generation to generation not look dated a year after the owner has made a sizeable investment. We at Boston &amp; Stewill want our watches to be as desirable in 50 years’ time as they are now.</p>
<p>The result was the Tourer II, our take on the classic chronograph. We set out to create a beautiful watch with a timeless look using a Swiss chronograph movement. Our inspiration came from a number of vintage speedometers, adding a modern twist to a classic style, easily seen in our dial design and leather racing strap with deploy clasp. The watch will be available in four different dial colours, white, cream, black and racing green and will come with the option of either a brown or black leather strap.</p>

<br/><br/>When Dr. Yonatan Manor’s father began to lose balance and fall at the ripe age of over 80, he at first thought little of it, relating it to age, which was probably true. His wife, however, knowing his innovative nature and researcher’s mind, teased him to “do something to prevent him from falling”. At first he thought there is nothing to be done. After all, elderly people tend to fall and so far no solution has been invented yet. Sure there are the ages old preventive measures such as four legged walkers and canes. Some attempts have even been made to create alarm systems that can detect a fall when it happens and even alert the doctor’s office or a relative, to let them know the senior had fallen. But fall prevention? Other than exercise and physical therapy there is nothing out there that seems to prevent falls. <br/>Being a researcher, though, Yonatan had that little voice in his head that kept nudging him “do something!” And so he finally did! <br/>He began by watching his father walk, stand up, sit down and occasionally lose balance. He then observed other elderly people and noticed recurring patterns in their falls. He studied the literature and medical research and learned all about the bio-mechanics of the human body, about balance maintenance and balance disorder. He learned all about the center of gravity, base of support and the backward step which healthy and younger people take to regain balance, and which older people fail to take or take too late due to degraded sensing and slow reflexes.<br/>Armed with the information he needed, Yonatan realized that since his father could not take the backward step in time, he needed to find a way to take that step for him. This is when teamed up with his longtime friends and colleagues, Abraham and Aharon (Arale), both engineers with impressive track records of their own, and together they “reinvented the shoe”, bringing B-Shoe to life!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/187741/files/20131110061507-yonatam.png?1384092907"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/187745/files/20131110061609-title5.png?1384092969"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8em;"">To make the B-Shoe dream come true we knew that we have to put together a winning team of doctors and engineers.

<p class=""p1"">We're an up-and-coming accessories brand based in the U.S.A. and Rwanda, Africa. Our designs are inspired by the spirit and diversity of Rwanda, as we mix materials and traditional skills from different artisan collectives around the country to make something new.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Like a top chef who searches the world for the finest local ingredients, we seek out the best, all-natural materials in Rwanda to make our accessories. The result? Unique, high quality jewelry that you won't find anywhere else!</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">We're turning to the Indiegogo community to help us build a fashion workshop and production center in Kigali, Rwanda's capital.</h3>

<p class=""p1"">Songa Designs started in 2011 when we (Sarah and Ellie) began working closely with women artisan-entrepreneurs all across Rwanda, meeting in cramped, poorly-lit rooms.  Despite their incredible skill, most of them still lived day-to-day, doing all they could to keep themselves and their families safe and fed.</p>
<p>In those tiny rooms, our conversations were about more than daily survival. We talked about the fulfillment and sense of pride that artists feel when creating something of value.  We decided there and then that we could build a business with our combined skills and talents—by working together to make beautiful jewelry.</p>
<p class=""p1""><img alt=""Rolling hills"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/291/361/5266d9c39e3c8efec74e54bf52b2b659_large.jpg?1354585945"" src="""" style="""" title=""Rolling hills""/></p>
<p class=""p1"">In 1994, genocide devastated Rwanda. Since then, Rwanda has rebuilt itself and the world has lent support. The land here is beautiful. The people here are beautiful.</p>
<p class=""p1"">We asked ourselves: <strong><em>Can fashion accessories create change?</em></strong></p>
<p>Slowly we <span>all </span>heal - through work that motivates us and lifts our spirits.</p>
<h2><strong>Rwandans want to change their story</strong></h2>

<p>We're proud of building a small company with a big social impact but in order to grow our business even further, we need to streamline and centralize our production. Rwanda is a country close in size to the state of Maryland, but because of its topography, our artisans, who each specialize in a different material and traditional skill, are hours away from each other. As you can imagine, distance makes it difficult to produce each of our mixed-material pieces!<span> </span></p>

<p class=""p2"">We want to spend less time traveling back and forth between cooperatives (red X's on the map above) and more time training, streamlining processes and creating innovative new designs.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>So far, our accessories look fantastic. Orders are starting to come in. </strong>A workshop will enable us to produce larger orders in less time, maintain our high standards, and design new and exciting product lines. We need a central location where we can:</p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li3"">Send materials and assemble products</li>
<li class=""li3"">Warehouse our products</li>
<li class=""li3"">Work with artisans</li>

Songa Designs…

Makes eco-friendly, fashion-forward jewelry.
Is the creation of two American entrepreneurs.
Weaves together fashion, global opportunities, and positive impact to make sustainable change in Rwanda.



We're an up-and-coming accessories brand based in the U.S.A. and Rwanda, Africa. Our designs are inspired by the spirit and diversity of Rwanda, as we mix materials and traditional skills from different artisan collectives around the country to make something new.
Like a top chef who searches the world for the finest local ingredients, we seek out the best, all-natural materials in Rwanda to make our accessories. The result? Unique, high quality jewelry that you won't find anywhere else!
We're turning to the Indiegogo community to help us build a fashion workshop and production center in Kigali, Rwanda's capital.

Songa Designs started in 2011 when we (Sarah and Ellie) began working closely with women artisan-entrepreneurs all across Rwanda, meeting in cramped, poorly-lit rooms.  Despite their incredible skill, most of them still lived day-to-day, doing all they could to keep themselves and their families safe and fed.
In those tiny rooms, our conversations were about more than daily survival. We talked about the fulfillment and sense of pride that artists feel when creating something of value.  We decided there and then that we could build a business with our combined skills and talents—by working together to make beautiful jewelry.

In 1994, genocide devastated Rwanda. Since then, Rwanda has rebuilt itself and the world has lent support. The land here is beautiful. The people here are beautiful.
We asked ourselves: Can fashion accessories create change?
Slowly we all heal - through work that motivates us and lifts our spirits.
Rwandans want to change their story

We’ve spent the last two years working with 150 artisans in eight artisan cooperatives to refine our methods and train an exclusively Rwandan team to create over 20 different, intricate and mixed-material accessories.


Now we face our biggest challenge: consolidating production in a workshop and training center.

We're proud of building a small company with a big social impact but in order to grow our business even further, we need to streamline and centralize our production. Rwanda is a country close in size to the state of Maryland, but because of its topography, our artisans, who each specialize in a different material and traditional skill, are hours away from each other. As you can imagine, distance makes it difficult to produce each of our mixed-material pieces! 
Our team needs a workshop in Rwanda

We want to spend less time traveling back and forth between cooperatives (red X's on the map above) and more time training, streamlining processes and creating innovative new designs.
So far, our accessories look fantastic. Orders are starting to come in. A workshop will enable us to produce larger orders in less time, maintain our high standards, and design new and exciting product lines. We need a central location where we can:

Send materials and assemble products
Warehouse our products
Work with artisans
Hold training sessions
Check product quality efficiently and in one location
Design new jewelry and product lines

When a woman is on a mission, she can't be stopped! The women we work with in Rwanda don't need aid or charity—they need an outlet for their creativity and a place in the market to display their talents and sell their products. 
Indiegogo is that place.
On Indiegogo, we've seen that good things happen when artists and creatives are able to connect to fans and true supporters of their work. The beautiful Rwanda we know shouldn't be land-locked behind borders or hidden behind its notorious past.
Indiegogo is a chance to start telling a different story, together, and help lots of people look good in the process!


We need to raise $20,000 to make our dream a reality. Your funding will help us:

Secure a workshop space in Kigali
Fulfill Indiegogo rewards
Buy product materials
Pay staff and artisans to produce rewards
Furnish workshop with equipment
Fund transportation for artisans traveling from distant villages
Remember, we are a fair-trade business and not a non-profit. By supporting this campaign, you'll make a huge impact in building our workshop from the ground up!
Our project is all-or-nothing—""fixed funding."" This means if we don't raise our total goal, no one receives their rewards, and most unfortunately, we won't have a central workshop space.  When you contribute, Indiegogo will charge your credit card immediately.  But if the campaign doesn't hit its funding goal, the payments will be refunded when the campaign ends.  
We know we can meet our goal, but only with your help and by sharing our project with others will we be able to climb this next summit. You will move our business forward!

<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;""><span style=""font-family: lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif;"">We need to create the tooling to manufacture the various parts of the product.

<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;""><span style=""font-family: lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif;""><strong>Software:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;""><span style=""font-family: lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif;"">The app is functional, but does not yet include all the features we want. Developing the software for these features may take longer than expected.
We have mitigated this risk by bringing in people who have a lot of experience in this area. If necessary, we’ll bring in more resources to ensure the app is everything we want it to be.
We will undoubtedly experience some surprises on our journey, but we trust that we have the team to overcome the challenges that arise in the future as we have overcome the challenges we faced in the past.
Our goal is to make the best possible product for you and to deliver it right on time.</span></span></p>

The XYZE app is finally available for iOS device. Download here the best app to shop online with your right size.



Do you hate it when the clothes you buy online don’t fit right? Get a better fit when you take your measurements with on, our digital measuring tape.

Create your digital size profile by using our XYZE app to translate your real measurements into a brand’s particular size specifications. Anything you order will fit perfectly.

on is built on revolutionary technology. Up to 160 cm (63 inches) of circular tape and a removable 3V battery that lasts 48 months. And it’s all in a soft, compact design developed in Italy.

 

Smart Connection

Our resize technology allows you to take accurate body measurements and have them automatically sent to the app via Bluetooth.
Tape

on is the most innovative measuring tape ever. It’s user friendly and it doesn’t slip the way most standard measuring tapes do.
Battery

on is powered by a 3V battery that lasts up to 48 months and can easily be replaced.
Design made in Italy


Designed and produced entirely in Italy, on’s technology is the product of 18 months of research and development. It’s compact and extremely portable allowing you to take it anywhere at any time.



The user friendly app collects all your body measurements, chest, waist, hips, etc., and translates them into your XYZE ID, a personal digital profile that ensures you get the right size.



Apps for smartwatches are in development so soon you will be able to keep all your measurements on hand.
Do you buy clothes online?
Buying clothes online is incredibly convenient, but there’s a big drawback, you can’t try the clothes on before you buy. Many people don’t buy clothes online for just this reason, and those who do often find they return the clothes because they just don’t fit.

We have solved this problem with on, and now we’re making it available to you.

At the heart of our algorithm is our ongoing research with our special retailers and online partners. We combine a great deal of experience in fashion modeling and sizing, with the production of quality digital products.

Our expert algorithm calculates the ratio between your body measurements and matches them to the brands’ clothes specifications.

The XYZE app translates your measurements into a brand’s particular size specifications, so no matter your size, you know you’ll get the right fit.


We are implementing this solution on all operating systems to be fast and highly scalable. Just find the WHAT’S MY SIZE? Button in your favorite brand’s e-shopping portal and use XYZE.





We created XYZE to dramatically enhance your online shopping experience by increasing your confidence in your ability to choose the right size.
You won’t have to return your favorite clothes anymore!




XYZE is an innovative Italian start-up conceived in 2012 during the MA.D.E.E – MasterLab in Digital Economics & Entrepreneurship – held at Digital Accademia (H-Farm Ventures) in 2012. XYZE was then established at H-Farm, Treviso, in July 2013.

H-Farm is a Venture Incubator based in the Treviso countryside. It operates internationally in the fields of Web, Digital, New Media and the Internet of Things. It fosters the development of start-ups based on innovative business models. Founded with the aim of helping young entrepreneurs launch small innovative enterprises, and Italian companies enter the digital world. H-Farm offers its partners qualified services in the fields of strategic consulting, financial planning and training.

Our management team consists of three founders with diverse experiences and skills, coming from the fields of marketing, product and digital development. The XYZEDEV team consists of eight professionals working on digital development and product design.


We are cooperating with the best industrial partners, advisors and consultants to get on the market.


We have spent the last 18 months developing on and getting it ready for production.
We have identified the next steps for manufacturing and fulfillment and have great partners ready to go. We also know that before mass production begins, we may encounter some problems. We have plans to mitigate those risks, and have enlisted great advisors to help.
Manufacturing:
We need to create the tooling to manufacture the various parts of the product. This is a complex process requiring time and money. Complications could emerge and delay the manufacturing schedule. We have mitigated the risk by carefully selecting our manufacturing partners.
Software:
The app is functional, but does not yet include all the features we want. Developing the software for these features may take longer than expected.
We have mitigated this risk by bringing in people who have a lot of experience in this area. If necessary, we’ll bring in more resources to ensure the app is everything we want it to be.
We will undoubtedly experience some surprises on our journey, but we trust that we have the team to overcome the challenges that arise in the future as we have overcome the challenges we faced in the past.
Our goal is to make the best possible product for you and to deliver it right on time.

<p>A key component of
any eyewear is the lens. We are so excited that Madison has received approval
to use Carl Zeiss lenses on its frames. Carl Zeiss is one of the most
prestigious technical instrument makers in the world. Since 1847, its lens products
have been used by companies such as Kodak, Kyocera, Nokia, Pentax, Canon, Nikon
as well as military agencies. With Carl Zeiss optical lenses, Madison sunglasses
provide quality, precision and top-notch clarity. In a sense, Madison will
change the way people see the world.</p>

Sunglasses Should Fit You Like Your Favorite Pair Of Jeans


Madison was
initially created to solve a personal problem.  Over the years, we’ve
bought numerous pairs of sunglasses that were never quite right. There always
seemed to be an issue with drooping on the nose or the angle of the frames on
the cheek. We had to compromise with every purchase, settling with an
imperfect fit for a $200+ price point.
After
speaking with friends and family, we realized we weren’t the only ones with
this issue—most everyone we talked to had some level of dissatisfaction with
their sunglasses. We saw this as an opportunity to solve a common problem and
do it in a way that allows us to create premium quality sunglasses at an
affordable price.

PRODUCT
DETAILS 


Madison sunglasses
are crafted of hand-made cellulose acetate with precise color combinations
that are both timeless and on-trend. Re-engineered nose bridge alleviates the
issue of dropping. Each frame also features five-barrel hinges with real rivets
that are both ornamental and functional: pins secure all the way through the
acetate to give the frames durability and strength.


 








 



A key component of
any eyewear is the lens. We are so excited that Madison has received approval
to use Carl Zeiss lenses on its frames. Carl Zeiss is one of the most
prestigious technical instrument makers in the world. Since 1847, its lens products
have been used by companies such as Kodak, Kyocera, Nokia, Pentax, Canon, Nikon
as well as military agencies. With Carl Zeiss optical lenses, Madison sunglasses
provide quality, precision and top-notch clarity. In a sense, Madison will
change the way people see the world.



 



ICONIC
STYLE


In creating the
initial styles for Madison, we drew inspiration from our favorite fashion
period: the 1950s and 60s. We picked two iconic styles of Square Frame (Bali)
and Round Frame (Maldives) and added our own updated twist in the details.
These styles are not only classic, but also timeless.

<p>Smart Buckle has been thoroughly tested to ensure it can withstand any real-world conditions. The Smart Buckle enclosure is designed to harmoniously pair with the mechanical resistance of most luxury-classic watches. With a waterproof level of IP57, you can wash your hands or run in the rain without damaging your Smart Buckle.</p>

By understanding your sleep you can prevent future chronic biological and physical health problems in your body. 

By analysing your sleep history and regular cycles of different sleep patterns, you can bring complete control over your lifestyle for balanced health and a peaceful state of mind. analysing your sleep history and regular cycles of different sleep patterns, you can bring complete control over your lifestyle for balanced health and a peaceful state of mind.

</h3><p><strong>What exactly does Pause do?</strong><br/>Pause blocks cell-phone signals, Wi-Fi included, and enables families, friends, and groups to create phone-free quality time. </p><p><strong>Why do I need it? Why not just put my phone on airplane mode? </strong><br/>We agree and we encourage you to do so. Families we spoke to expressed their challenges to us, which is what led us to design Pause in the first place.  It’s just one of those things that seems easier than it is. The mere presence of Pause serves as a reminder to put your phone away and helps families create a daily phone-free routine.  </p><p><strong>How can Pause help me?</strong><br/>We designed Pause to eliminate distractions and make it easier for all of us to disconnect from our smartphones. We’ve been testing Pause, and over the last few months Pause has helped our families greatly reduce our phone overuse. With continuous use, Pause can help us build and strengthen a habit of putting our phones away and being present.</p><p><strong>How do I use Pause?</strong><br/>Just put your phones inside the Pause box and close the lid. That’s it. There are no installations, no setups, no downloads nor any kind of activation. It’s like a plug n’ play, only the opposite: unplug and don’t play.    </p><p><strong>Why do you think we need help?</strong><br/>Let's face it - excessive smartphone use is a modern day epidemic. We’re available 27/4 but never truly present with anyone anywhere. In the recent years it’s becoming more and more rare to have a genuine, present conversation with other people. Pause provides an incentive and a daily reminder to take control over your time and attention.<br/> <br/><strong>It doesn’t really solve the problem as I still need to put my </strong><strong>kids</strong><strong> phones in the box</strong><br/>We’re not claiming Pause is magical. You’ll still need to enforce the new tradition, but after a few days, you’ll notice that everyone will start to look forward to it, and appreciate the time spent with one another. Pause is a tool, not a magic bullet - you have to set the example (you set an example)<br/> <br/><strong>Will the phone’s battery be drained while inside the box?</strong><br/>Nope. The box's technology doesn’t drain the battery. Smart-phones behave as if in any other environment that lacks reception.<br/> <br/><strong>Is there a safety issue?</strong><br/>Nope. The physical nature of Pause is based on the ""Faraday Cage Concept"", which means that the case is blocking the phone's RF inside the box and transforming it to electric fields. In that way much less radiation is transmitted outside of the box and using it is 100% safe.</p><p> </p><h3>SOCIAL<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476798176/umso0ynhuxqnjw0wfnul.png"" src="""" style=""""/>

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Our goal is to bring conversation back to the table!Phones are addictive and our impulse to check and use our phones has seeped into all aspects of our lives. Pause is here to encourage you to put your phones aside, if only for a short meaningful while. When you put your phones in a Pause box, it blocks all wi-fi signals, all incoming calls, and all text messages as well as any other cell phone distractions. IN THE PRESS WHY PAUSE?
The simple answer is that phones have an addictive nature.  We all claim that we'll disconnect, but the truth is, most of us never do.This is why we need Pause.Pause isn't a magical fix, but it is a lifestyle product designed to encourage and make it easy for us (both adults and kids) to put our phones down. HOW TO USE PAUSE?
It’s super easy- just put your phone in the box and close the lid. That's it. It’s made from special materials that block all cellphone signals.Pause was designed for the whole family, starting with parents who set the example by putting their phones in first to communicate the message that “family time is important.” FEATURES
  
WHEN TO USE PAUSE?  CREATE YOUR OWN ROUTINE When challenging families to set their phones aside, we’ve found that it’s more difficult than it sounds.Developing new routines is a great way to break bad habits and Pause was designed to encourage the whole family to create a new phone-free daily routine. Before you know it, Pause will become a part of your day too. BENEFITS
Reclaim family timeResearch has shown that spending just 20 minutes of quality family time together is key for healthy child development and helps bring families together. Also, social gatherings are much more fun when you’re actually paying attention. Reduce conflictPause reduces friction and it’s ease of use helps minimize family arguments over phone usage. No more, “I’m just checking that last email” or “just googling what we talked about on Wikipedia.” Once you put your phones in Pause it shifts the atmosphere, eliminating all distractions. UnwindHaving some “me-time” can help you concentrate, relax and reconnect. Pause helps you reduce anxiety caused by being available 24/7. It’s very simple - less stress equals more happiness.Be more efficientPause can combat what’s being reported as the biggest problem with meetings by 47% of employees - lack of attention across the board.Stay FocusedPause lets you totally disconnect, allowing you to focus on people and  projects that you don't normally have time for because you're constantly distracted by messages, emails, social media, and all the other wonderful things the internet has to offer. HOW DOES PAUSE HELP?Pause helps us disconnect using three key aspects: availability, ease-of-use, and physical separation. AvailabilityPause serves as an invitation to spend phone free family time together, and its provide a constant reminder to put phones away.Ease of UsePause is quick and easy to use, no setup required - just close the lid  Physical SeparationPause uses ""Out of sight, out off mind"" principle to remove the temptation of peeking at email or social media when focus is needed elsewhere   CHOOSE YOUR PAUSE
 
JUST SHARE - BRING BACK FAMILY CONVERSATIONS 
We understand that sometimes, after putting your family’s phones in Pause, it can be difficult to start a meaningful and constructive conversation with each other.That is exactly the reason why we've decided to partner with ""Just Share"" and offer you a basic set of amazing playing cards suitable for kids and teens to help you initiate a conversation. Now you can talk to each other and share your daily moments.The game aims to strengthen the bond between parent and child, between siblings or friends by exploring  and sharing feelings, thoughts, and experiences with one another in a creative way.  ""Just Share"" is a non-competitive activity for the whole family. The recommended ages are for parents and children aged 5-12, though children of any age can enjoy and partake in the fun.What's in the package: a basic set of 12 Just Share cards WHAT EXPERTS SAY
World renowned educational adviser Tamir Leon says:""We must accept that excessive smartphone use has symptoms of addiction. For the good of our families, we need to be able to disconnect. I believe in Pause and in the transformation it can do in our lives. It is a smart and simple solution for a big problem. It is the perfect tool to create a family habit and to remind us all to disconnect.”  WHAT YOU GET
The Pause package includes the Pause box, which can contain up to 6 smartphones.Choose your Pause's top color - Pinewood, red, cream, green or blue. REWARDS
  
SPECSThe Pause Box was especially designed to block radio transmissions, Wi-Fi, and cell phone frequencies. The aluminum made structure and unique seal of the lid are what enables Pause to completely block all signals.The complex engineering is based on Faraday Cage concept. Once your phone is in Pause it’s radio waves are literally transformed into electric currents so that you can enjoy phone-free quality time.The Pause Box is designed to blend in into any room or office with quality silver matte polished exterior and your choice of color for the top.Each Pause Box can fit up to 6 phones at any time.
TIMELINE

MEET THE TEAM
  Tenenbaum Hazan Creative House FAQ
What exactly does Pause do?Pause blocks cell-phone signals, Wi-Fi included, and enables families, friends, and groups to create phone-free quality time. Why do I need it? Why not just put my phone on airplane mode? We agree and we encourage you to do so. Families we spoke to expressed their challenges to us, which is what led us to design Pause in the first place.  It’s just one of those things that seems easier than it is. The mere presence of Pause serves as a reminder to put your phone away and helps families create a daily phone-free routine.  How can Pause help me?We designed Pause to eliminate distractions and make it easier for all of us to disconnect from our smartphones. We’ve been testing Pause, and over the last few months Pause has helped our families greatly reduce our phone overuse. With continuous use, Pause can help us build and strengthen a habit of putting our phones away and being present.How do I use Pause?Just put your phones inside the Pause box and close the lid. That’s it. There are no installations, no setups, no downloads nor any kind of activation. It’s like a plug n’ play, only the opposite: unplug and don’t play.    Why do you think we need help?Let's face it - excessive smartphone use is a modern day epidemic. We’re available 27/4 but never truly present with anyone anywhere. In the recent years it’s becoming more and more rare to have a genuine, present conversation with other people. Pause provides an incentive and a daily reminder to take control over your time and attention. It doesn’t really solve the problem as I still need to put my kids phones in the boxWe’re not claiming Pause is magical. You’ll still need to enforce the new tradition, but after a few days, you’ll notice that everyone will start to look forward to it, and appreciate the time spent with one another. Pause is a tool, not a magic bullet - you have to set the example (you set an example) Will the phone’s battery be drained while inside the box?Nope. The box's technology doesn’t drain the battery. Smart-phones behave as if in any other environment that lacks reception. Is there a safety issue?Nope. The physical nature of Pause is based on the ""Faraday Cage Concept"", which means that the case is blocking the phone's RF inside the box and transforming it to electric fields. In that way much less radiation is transmitted outside of the box and using it is 100% safe. SOCIAL",57.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We, Benoît DESGUIN and Romain GAUTIEZ, are two belgian entrepreneurs who associated their strength and passions to create the <b>first tactical mechanical watch,</b> the <b>One Day One Color</b> (aka O.D.O.C) !</p>
<p>Romain is engineer in electromechanics and Benoît is architect / designer. They know each other for a very long time but this project is their first collaboration. While Romain created the functions of the tactile system that moves the hands of the watch, Benoît designed several watches drawings until the moment their common goals were reached : a design and technological watch, <b>O.D.O.C</b>. This watch combines all the classical side of the watch (circleshaped, hands) but with a complete new technology never used before !</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our campaign has a very simple goal : manufacture and expand the collection of <b>O.D.O.C</b>. For the moment, the watches that are showed in the video are working prototypes. We now need support and funding to buy and create the manufacturing tools we need for a complete production and to hire a marketing company that will expand and sell our brand throughout the world.</span></p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So, by funding our project, on any level, you'll help us to (trully) make a dream come true for us ! And more of that : you'll wear on your wrist a <i>unique</i> watch only available with this campaign !</span></span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The funding we need reaches 70,000 $.</p>
<p>We need these to buy the tooling machines and produce the watches you've ordered to us (and we thank you for that ;) )</p>
<p>In the price of our different perks, the transportation is included so the price you pay for the perk is fixed and nothing more will be asked to you !</p>
<p>Our perks are quite simple : it's all about watches !</p>
<p>We can propose you two different styles of O.D.O.C : </p>
<p>- Stainless steel case : the black, design and sober watch with a leather strap.</p>
<p>- Aluminium case : the colorful, fashion and enjoyable watch with a rubber strap. </p>
<p>The perks detailed : </p>
<p>- 1$ thank you : thank you for your support, pal ;)</p>
<p>- one aluminium case watch : it couldn't be more obvious ! This perk make you the owner of a colorful watch in one of the following colors : blue, red, green, yellow and black.</p>
<p>- one stainless steel watch : nice choice ! You are now the owner of one of our black leather strap watches : gold, pink gold, blue and silver.</p>
<p>- Two for one alu perk : you'll get delivered two aluminium case watches of the color of your choice.</p>
<p>- Two for one Steel perk : chose among our steel case watches and pick two.</p>
<p>- In the mix : chose one alu and one steel watch and we'll send it to you !</p>
<p>- All-in alu : you'll receive all of our actual color in the aluminium model. </p>
<p>- All-in steel : you prefer steel ? No problem, we'll send you all we have ! 4 steel cases watches with genuine leather strap</p>
<p>- Re-seller perk : 10 watches of your choice.</p>
<p>- Distributor perk : you'll get 20 of our watches, specify what colors, steel or alu case and you'll get it !</p>
<p>If we are not able to reach our funding, we thank everybody that helped us but we can't do anything unless we reach our goal, the tooling machines are way too expensive for us to buy them by ourselves. So all the fundings will be given back to their founder. But you and us this won't happen, right ?  ;)</p>

So, by funding our project, on any level, you'll help us to (trully) make a dream come true for us ! And more of that : you'll wear on your wrist a unique watch only available with this campaign !   What We Need & What You Get The funding we need reaches 70,000 $.
We need these to buy the tooling machines and produce the watches you've ordered to us (and we thank you for that ;) )
In the price of our different perks, the transportation is included so the price you pay for the perk is fixed and nothing more will be asked to you !
Our perks are quite simple : it's all about watches !
We can propose you two different styles of O.D.O.C : 
- Stainless steel case : the black, design and sober watch with a leather strap.
- Aluminium case : the colorful, fashion and enjoyable watch with a rubber strap. 
The perks detailed : 
- 1$ thank you : thank you for your support, pal ;)
- one aluminium case watch : it couldn't be more obvious ! This perk make you the owner of a colorful watch in one of the following colors : blue, red, green, yellow and black.
- one stainless steel watch : nice choice ! You are now the owner of one of our black leather strap watches : gold, pink gold, blue and silver.
- Two for one alu perk : you'll get delivered two aluminium case watches of the color of your choice.
- Two for one Steel perk : chose among our steel case watches and pick two.
- In the mix : chose one alu and one steel watch and we'll send it to you !
- All-in alu : you'll receive all of our actual color in the aluminium model. 
- All-in steel : you prefer steel ? No problem, we'll send you all we have ! 4 steel cases watches with genuine leather strap
- Re-seller perk : 10 watches of your choice.
- Distributor perk : you'll get 20 of our watches, specify what colors, steel or alu case and you'll get it !
If we are not able to reach our funding, we thank everybody that helped us but we can't do anything unless we reach our goal, the tooling machines are way too expensive for us to buy them by ourselves. So all the fundings will be given back to their founder. But you and us this won't happen, right ?  ;)
The Impact
 Once we succeed in our campaign, you'll see O.D.O.C watches in the jewelry, mall, shop...next to your home. That's really our main and most important goal : expand our brand so anyone can wear a design technological quality watch at an affordable price !
Risks & Challenges
 As already mentioned, the watches' market is a very difficult one where success and defeats are seen everyday !
We know it ! And now, so do you ! But we are convinced that our O.D.O.C brings a fresh air to this market. We have to make it accepted by the resellers and by you, the public ! So feel free watch our video as many times as you want and, of course, ask us all the questions you need.
Even if we don't reach our funding goal, we will never fail thanks to the experience we collected, the links to the professionals of watches (distributors, subcontractors, fair organizers...). If this campaign fail, we'll consider as the launching of the next one !
Other Ways You Can Help
 If you love our project but you never wear watches, feel free to help with the most important perk : the 1$ support perk ! Everyone that helps deserves our gratitude, no matter what !
You can also share and spread this campaign to all your friends, relations, colleagues, family...Anyone you think will love this project just like you, share ! Share ! Share ! Indiegogo created very useful tools for sharing, so please, use them ;)

We really hope you'll enjoy wearing O.D.O.C just like we enjoyed creating it !

Thank you very much, to all of you !

<p><span>Tailly is not just a toy, nor is it a fashion accessory or a gadget. It is those three items combined, and, since it reacts to the heart beat rate, an extension of the users’ body. Tailly is fun to wear to parties, while out with friends or playing with kids. You could even wear Tailly on a date and express your true feelings through the wagging tail. Even better, your partner could also wear one for the both of you to add a level of subconscious communication between the two of you.</span></p>

<p>Thanks to NeuroSky, “necomimi” has successfully shipped to the market and has reached numerous customers.

</div>Hi! We are Elyse Taylor and Kate Czerwonka and we are here to bring you the Taylor Trunk Generation Collection!  <br/><br/>Elyse is the fifth-generation of Taylor Trunk Company. Our story began in Louisville, Kentucky in 1883 when my great-great grandfather started building travel steamer trunks in his garage.  Over the next 133 years each generation in the Taylor family has further developed the company, each bringing new innovative ideas... ultimately contributing to our resilience and success of where we are today.  My forefathers have survived nationally difficult economic situations and have persevered as a travel centered business during times when traveling wasn't desired.  Now as the retail industry is evolving it is my turn to build upon my legacy and conquer my own hurdles. I have welcomed this opportunity &amp; responsibility with open arms.<br/><br/>So, with your help we plan on building the Taylor Trunk name into a brand. With over 130 years in the luggage and travel goods business, Taylor Trunk understands our customer's travel needs. Therefore, we believe that we can build a brand that will be the foundation of all our customer's travels. <br/><br/>In order to this we must stay true to our developed <strong>TRUNK</strong> values: <br/><br/><strong>Tradition:</strong> For five generations, Taylor Trunk Company has been a place where tradition and innovation come together.""  Therefore we have chosen the name ""Generation Collection"" to support our proud family heritage of tradition.<br/><br/><strong>Reputation:</strong> Our excellent reputation within the city of Louisville is pristine, and we are committed to always keeping it that way. Therefore we wanted our own product to obtain the same excellence.  The select pieces of the Generation Collection are made from the finest top grain leather, using high-quality hardware, and superior craftsmanship. Personal attention to detail from craftsman who genuinely care about their work go into every piece. You can expect leather goods of distinction and durability from the Generation Collection.""<br/><br/><strong>Unique:</strong> Every item in our collection is unique because every hide is unique. The Columbian leather that we have chosen is an entirely natural product. Therefore, each individual piece within our collection will vary slightly, which will add to the character of the bag. Like a fine wine, this leather will only get better with age and use... as it develops a deep, rich, beautiful patina. <br/><br/><strong>Neighborliness / Trustworthy:</strong> We have always considered customer service as one of our top priorities. Therefore, we have established a 3 year warranty for any manufacturer defects of our products. We believe that this adequately displays our confidence in our products quality. <br/><br/><strong>Knowledge / Expertise:</strong> We wanted the products of our Generation Collection to support what we specialize in: Duffles, Backpack, Totes, &amp; Business Cases such as the executive brief, slim portfolio, &amp; letter pad... and Travel Accessories such as the  utility kit &amp; ultimate travel companion. <br/><br/>These products will range from $10 - $425 MSRP. <br/><br/>We have developed seven pieces for the Generation Collection.  These pieces have been on the market for approximately a year and make up less than 5% of Taylor Trunk's total sales.  With the $100,000 we plan to develop an in-depth and strategic marketing campaign that specifically targets to boost sales of the Generation Collection.   Our largest problem is that Taylor Trunk is known as a luggage retailer but not as a brand.  We have a loyal customer following and know the luggage and travel industry well. Elyse, Vice President of Taylor Trunk Company, has developed a strategic marketing plan that will reach our current customers and target new customers as well.  With your help we will use the funds we raise to establish ourselves as a brand and make the Generation Collection a household name.  Currently, an out dated website (poor techonology) has not allowed us the cabibility  for online sales and with your donations Elyse has been working effortlessly to launch a new website that is capable of handling online orders.  The Generation Collection will also be sold in our Superstore in Louisville and on Amazon.    Additionally, we hope to create additional pieces for the line that target a more feminine audience.  Within the next six months we plan to launch our new website and marketing campaign.  Within that we will reveal several new products that are specifically geared towards women,   Kate, our Innovation and Product Specialist, is working with a team of designers to create new peices that will expand the collection and offer more variety.  Over the next year we expect that the Generation Collection will be responsible for 15-18% of Taylor Trunk's overall sales.  With the high threat of competition from other brands we know that there are lots of other choices out there.  But with our130+ year reputation and commitment to exampilaory products we know that you investing in the Generation Collection brand is an investment in another 130 years of success, <br/><br/>We are eager to start this new chapter with you, and we appreciate you taking the time to learn about our story.  Any donation, big or small, helps!  For a limited time we will be offering pieces of our Generation Collection at a discounted price as a thank you for donations of those monetary denominations.  Listed below are the current pieces in our collection and for a limited time only you can receive one of these handmade pieces with your donation.  Thank you for supporting Taylor Trunk Company’s Generation Collection!<br/><br/>Elyse &amp; Kate<br/><p></p></div>","Hi!

We believe that this adequately displays our confidence in our products quality. Knowledge / Expertise: We wanted the products of our Generation Collection to support what we specialize in: Duffles, Backpack, Totes, & Business Cases such as the executive brief, slim portfolio, & letter pad... and Travel Accessories such as the  utility kit & ultimate travel companion. These products will range from $10 - $425 MSRP. We have developed seven pieces for the Generation Collection.  These pieces have been on the market for approximately a year and make up less than 5% of Taylor Trunk's total sales.  With the $100,000 we plan to develop an in-depth and strategic marketing campaign that specifically targets to boost sales of the Generation Collection.   Our largest problem is that Taylor Trunk is known as a luggage retailer but not as a brand.  We have a loyal customer following and know the luggage and travel industry well. Elyse, Vice President of Taylor Trunk Company, has developed a strategic marketing plan that will reach our current customers and target new customers as well.  With your help we will use the funds we raise to establish ourselves as a brand and make the Generation Collection a household name.  Currently, an out dated website (poor techonology) has not allowed us the cabibility  for online sales and with your donations Elyse has been working effortlessly to launch a new website that is capable of handling online orders.  The Generation Collection will also be sold in our Superstore in Louisville and on Amazon.    Additionally, we hope to create additional pieces for the line that target a more feminine audience.  Within the next six months we plan to launch our new website and marketing campaign.  Within that we will reveal several new products that are specifically geared towards women,   Kate, our Innovation and Product Specialist, is working with a team of designers to create new peices that will expand the collection and offer more variety.  Over the next year we expect that the Generation Collection will be responsible for 15-18% of Taylor Trunk's overall sales.  With the high threat of competition from other brands we know that there are lots of other choices out there.  But with our130+ year reputation and commitment to exampilaory products we know that you investing in the Generation Collection brand is an investment in another 130 years of success, We are eager to start this new chapter with you, and we appreciate you taking the time to learn about our story.  Any donation, big or small, helps!  For a limited time we will be offering pieces of our Generation Collection at a discounted price as a thank you for donations of those monetary denominations.  Listed below are the current pieces in our collection and for a limited time only you can receive one of these handmade pieces with your donation.  Thank you for supporting Taylor Trunk Company’s Generation Collection!Elyse & Kate",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>So here's the deal. Winter is awesome, but dry, scale-y hands are not. Harsh winds, bitter cold -not to mention snow and ice- wreak havoc on poor defenseless hands! Any level of protection is great, but to truly be healthy, hands need to be nourished.</p>
<p>There's no reason why skiers and snowboarders of any age can't <em>look</em> <strong>good</strong> and <em>feel</em> <strong>good</strong> when they're slicing through the trees, hitting up back-country powder, or ripping up the terrain park.  DarkSyde offers you superior quality winter gloves that make you <em>look </em><strong>good</strong>; make your hands <em>feel</em> <strong>good</strong>; and make your ride <em>even</em><em><em> more </em></em><strong>awesome</strong><strong>!</strong><em><strong>  </strong></em></p>
<h1>Performance : Comfort : Style</h1>
<p>Each one of these is equally important in creating the ultimate winter glove. So we have painstakingly sourced the perfect fabrics &amp; essential oils and designed high performance gloves to suit your needs on and off the hill.</p>
<h1><strong> <em>the</em> GLOVE</strong></h1>
<p>We've made DarkSyde the best winter gloves ever. Say goodbye to the days of cold, dry hands! Revel in the comfort of a waterproof outer, and soothe hurting hands with the oil-infused liner! And don't forget your phone...conductive patches on the thumb and index finger let you use touch screen devices without getting chilly fingers.</p>
<p>A design for every rider. Every detail was carefully considered to provide you with the most comfortable, high performance glove ever.</p>
<ul>
<li>Botanical oil-infused liner to nourish thirsty hands</li>
<li>Durable &amp; slightly stretchy fabric (so comfy you won't want to take it off)</li>
<li>Conductive patches for touch screen devices</li>
<li>Waterproof outers</li>
<li>Flattering unisex design and sizing</li>
<li>Four unique designs to suit your mood, or the terrain</li>
</ul><p><strong>The PALMYRA </strong>is the better-than-ever basic.  Along with all the features above, a waterproof, nylon outer protects hands even on the sickest terrain.  Elastic guards and wrist straps mean you won't lose your glove if you happen to tomahawk down the hill.</p>

<p><strong>The BRECKINRIDGE </strong>is our take on the mitten.  It features the same details as the PALMYRA but in a style reminiscent of snow days and snow ball fights.</p>

<p><strong>The JACKSON</strong> is our convertible mitten.  It features an oil-infused half glove with a corresponding mitten cover and velcro retention.  You still get conductive patches on the thumbs, but for those who need extended use of their hands, the JACKSON is for you.</p>
<div class=""template""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://brittanykeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Convertible.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>The ASPEN</strong> is the leather driving glove for those who spend more time in traffic than on the slopes (but we know where you'd rather be, right?).  Thinly insulated, the ASPEN features a tighter fit and an adjustable Velcro wrist strap on a waterproof leather outer.  Warm enough for pounding the pavement and stylish enough for any suit-and-tie.</p>

<p>My late husband Richard and I built a business from the ground up expanding on his trade of re-manufacturing automotive and heavy truck transmissions. As Vice President of Key Accounts and Business Operations, I secured several multi-million dollar contracts in the U.S. and Canada with some of the nations’ largest fleet operators. </p>
<p> In 2013, Richard became critically ill and we set out on a very difficult battle with his health, a battle that we would lose. Following open heart surgery and in need of a kidney transplant, I dedicated myself and my energies to caring for my husband, my best friend. Serving as a caregiver in those final days of the life of my husband was a true awakening for me. In an instant I realized the preciousness this life we are given, and that we all must live out our legend. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Richard passed away and I had to start over. Following my passions and talents, I designed my first collection in February of 2017 and had completed samples in September 2017 when I experienced my first live television interview, participated in my first runway show, and was named a finalist for Style Chicago’s Design Challenge Presented by Cadillac. I am very proud of this collection and have designed my next collection for FW2018 with the same intense pride. </p>
<p> My story is one of struggle, determination, fortitude and faith. I welcome you to take this journey with me! </p>
<p>When I began creating my first collection in February 2017, I used my own hard-earned money and resources. Along the way, I have driven for Uber, sold items on Ebay, and offered professional training and diet planning in addition to my full-time job. There has been no shortage of hard work!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> I love my first collection! It is beautiful. It is feminine. It is edgy but classic offering a modern twist. All pieces are made of the highest quality textiles, design, and construction. My pieces are built to last.</p>
<p>I have created this campaign and invited you on this journey with me to secure the capital I need to manufacture my second collection and continue living my legend. To show my immense gratitude for your support, I am offering pieces from my SS18 collection at various pledge levels.</p>
<p>If you like what you see in this first collection for SS18, you will love my second collection for FW18, which offers vibrant color with a lot of movement! Thank you for joining me on this amazing journey. With your support, I can continue to live my legend and create beautiful clothing to empower women.</p>

<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>
</p><p>We have come up with an innovative sylish and stealth way of carrying a tobacco pipe.</p>
<p>Through months of design, redesign, and testing we have developed our final prototype. <strong>The Buckle Puffer </strong>is machined from solid blocks of <strong>6061 Aluminum</strong>, and then nickel plated in an FDA approved facility. The industrial hard <strong>Nickel plating</strong> gives the Buckle Puffer a bright shine, long lasting durability, and provides safety when smoking out of. The Buckle Puffer was designed with functionality and style in mind.  Two precisely offset <strong>N</strong><strong>eodymium magnets</strong> (the strongest magnets on the market) are used to create a constant pull on the pipe producing a tight rattle free seal. In addition to the pull of these magnets, we've designed a latching system that utilizes the same magnetic field. The pipe can only be ejected when the magnetic powered release button is pressed. Unlike latches powered by unreliable springs, the magnetically powered latch can never wear out. </p>
<p><strong>Additional features include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Instant put out technology</li>
<li>Prevents emission of any noticeable odor due to extremely precise fit.</li>
<li>Deep reservoir</li>
<li>Double barrel intake</li>

<h2><strong>Materials</strong></h2>
<p>The Buckle Puffer is precision cut from solid blocks of <strong>6061 Aluminum</strong>. Not die cast. This method produces a stronger better quality more consistent product than casting Aluminum into various shapes. After precision machining, an industrial hard <strong>Nickel plating</strong> is applied using the electroless nickel plating process.  This process is performed by an FDA approved facility. The nickel plating gives the Buckle Puffer a smooth sliding feel, a bright cosmetic look, and superior corrosive protection that will last a lifetime.</p>

<p>Visit our website <strong><a href=""http://www.MaritimeWatches.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.MaritimeWatches.com</a></strong><br/><i> <br/>Thank you so much for checking out our campaign, we really do appreciate your support.</i></p>
<p><strong>What's is ""Maritime Watches?""</strong><br/><span><b>Defining Maritime:</b></span><i>""connected with the sea, especially in relation to seafaring"" -</i> Our team created Maritime Watches out of a desire to build a better watch brand, one that gives back to water related causes. Many people desire high quality dive watches but can't afford the multi thousand dollar price tag. Our goal is to create something beautiful, affordable, &amp; robust. We have spent the past 2 years developing this project and finally we are partnering with highly skilled watch makers to fill this gap in the market.</p>
<p>When designing our collections, we made sure of THREE key factors:</p>
<p>1. A luxurious look at an affordable price...<br/>2. A water tight, steel case...<br/>3. And, giving back to water related causes.<br/> <br/><u>Three Options:</u></p>
<p> 1. Ocean Blue (Blue &amp; Black Bezel) 2.  Black Pearl (Black Bezel) &amp; 3. ""The Prospector"" (Steel &amp; Gold Colored center links)</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>How do We Give Back?</strong><br/>We are partnering with two Non-for profit organizations that are experts in their respective areas. We focus on bringing you the best watches we can, while they focus on their causes that will save many lives both human and marine life.</p>
<p><b>Going Forward: </b><br/>We will continue to design beautiful, functional dive watches for all to enjoy. Join with us on this epic adventure and be apart of every step.  We will send out updates throughout the entire process making sure our backers are all caught up on any important details.  We want to create a relationship with our customers because we want you to have the best and most positive experience and product we can offer. We are excited to officially launch this company with your help.</p>
<p><strong>Meet our Team:</strong></p>
<p>Other than my friend Shane, who is a dedicated social media guru, I work on this project from top to bottom on my own. As we move forward I hope to expand my team to other individuals who are passionate about creating beautiful products and having a positive impact on the world.

</div></div>","Visit our website www.MaritimeWatches.com Thank you so much for checking out our campaign, we really do appreciate your support.
What's is ""Maritime Watches?""Defining Maritime:""connected with the sea, especially in relation to seafaring"" - Our team created Maritime Watches out of a desire to build a better watch brand, one that gives back to water related causes. Many people desire high quality dive watches but can't afford the multi thousand dollar price tag. Our goal is to create something beautiful, affordable, & robust. We have spent the past 2 years developing this project and finally we are partnering with highly skilled watch makers to fill this gap in the market.
When designing our collections, we made sure of THREE key factors:
1. A luxurious look at an affordable price...2. A water tight, steel case...3. And, giving back to water related causes. Three Options:
 1. Ocean Blue (Blue & Black Bezel) 2.  Black Pearl (Black Bezel) & 3. ""The Prospector"" (Steel & Gold Colored center links)
 

How do We Give Back?We are partnering with two Non-for profit organizations that are experts in their respective areas. We focus on bringing you the best watches we can, while they focus on their causes that will save many lives both human and marine life.
Going Forward: We will continue to design beautiful, functional dive watches for all to enjoy. Join with us on this epic adventure and be apart of every step.  We will send out updates throughout the entire process making sure our backers are all caught up on any important details.  We want to create a relationship with our customers because we want you to have the best and most positive experience and product we can offer. We are excited to officially launch this company with your help.
Meet our Team:
Other than my friend Shane, who is a dedicated social media guru, I work on this project from top to bottom on my own. As we move forward I hope to expand my team to other individuals who are passionate about creating beautiful products and having a positive impact on the world. If you have any hesitation that the project will not be able to be completed, let me tell you this: everything is all lined up, all we need is funding and then it's a GO. We are ready to grow and scale to new heights and we hope you join us on this journey. Thank you.

Something that showcases the incredible speed and precision of modern manufacturing, while also serving as a platform for creative messaging and self-expression.I’m proud to present the Prodigy Ring as that platform—a ring that puts the power of 3D printing in and on your hands.  With the Prodigy Ring, you can showcase your individuality, and let your creativity GROW!     A Prodigy Ring can be designed to commemorate a special date or a meaningful occasion. It can show dedication to an organization or cause you care deeply about, or it could simply hold a positive message that uplifts and encourages you throughout the day. The Prodigy Ring is the ultimate gift for any occasion! Option #1: MaterialStrong & Flexible Plastic    Plastic Prodigy Rings are fun and affordable accessories for you or a large group. These rings are smooth and lightweight and make great gifts.  The Plastic Prodigy Ring is perfect for those who want to take advantage of the many color options for an added level of creative expression.  Non-Precious Metals    3D printed Brass and Bronze are softer metals which mimic the smoothness and shine of precious metals, but at more affordable price points. These softer metals can capture complex designs and detailed fonts with ease, and they can also be left unpolished to showcase a beautiful and intricate surface design.  Steel    3D printed steel is a durable material that can easily stand up to daily use. These rings are remarkably light for their strength and have a smooth but wonderfully textured feel against your skin. Precious Metals    3D printed brass is coated (or ‘plated’) with a precious metal of your choosing (14k gold, 18k rose gold, or rhodium). This gives the brass the outward appearance of a precious metal to let you make a luxurious statement that won’t break the bank.The silver materials (Raw or Polished) are solid all the way through, and their ability to stand up to everyday wear make them excellent materials for long-lasting rings. Plated rhodium has incredible rust-proof properties that make it an outstanding material for personalized trophies or mementos.  Option #2: Band Style    Wide Bands have extended edges to help you make a bold statement with your custom ring.Narrow Bands have a thin strip of metal connecting the top and bottom of the letters. These bands are unisex and discrete, and stand a little taller than an average wedding ring.  This style also makes great custom necklaces.Stackable Bands make for dainty rings that feel weightless on the finger. These bands can be combined with other stackable rings to produce custom messages that go up and down the finger, or with a variety of materials to take your accessories to the next level!   Option #3: Charms  

 
Charms are centerpiece symbols that give a bold callout to each ring. Use these to truly make your ring a one-of-a-kind masterpiece!  Option #4. Custom Message    Unlike with a typical ring engraving, your personalized message is built into the ring's design to guarantee it won't be overlooked.  No other jewelry like this exists, and no jewelry making process can achieve this other than 3D printing.  Option #5. Font     You can also choose a custom font to add deeper sentiment and personalization to your message.   Ring Size  Because each ring is individually crafted, it is designed to fit you perfectly.  You only need to specify the size of the ring, which can range from 4.5 to 13.5, and is available in half-size increments.     Long Distance Purchases     With an infinite number of messages and over a dozen material options and styles to choose from, each Prodigy Ring is guaranteed to be uniquely yours. The Prodigy Ring is bespoke, luxurious and a creative statement; it breaks the mold of the traditional jewelry industry by offering a modern piece that is designed with sophisticated, cutting edge 3D printing technology.  But ultimately, what makes these rings special is that they are designed for you, and by you.    Want to see more awesome pictures of Prodigy Rings? Check out our Instagram page here. Also, follow us on Facebook!   Jewelry creation (3D printed or otherwise) typically begins with a wax version of the piece which is hand-carved by a designer. That wax object is then immersed in a heat-resistant material such as plaster to form a mold, and the wax is melted out of the mold to create an empty space that is then filled with molten metal. Once the metal cools, the mold is broken and discarded to obtain the final object. Diagram showing the Step-by-step production of 3D printed jewelry. Image courtesy of Sculpteo. 3D printing speeds up the traditional jewelrymaking process by allowing the precise creation of many wax rings in a matter of hours, which is significantly faster than the days that it could take a designer to hand-carve even a single custom piece. (It's also much faster and more scalable than other automated methods of wax mold production, like CNC machining). By automating one of the most time-consuming steps in jewelry production, we can create stunning one-of-a-kind rings for everyone to enjoy at affordable prices. Prodigy Rings make excellent custom napkin rings for banquets and weddings as well! The pictured ring is a wideband in size 8, 3D-printed in raw bronze. Size 13 is recommended for cloth napkins. 3D modeling and 3D printing are incredibly powerful tools for creation on their own. But by using computer programming, the average time to complete the 3D modeling design process for any number of rings can be reduced from 30 minutes to 30 SECONDS per ring. See the difference in the video clips below!   Prodigy Rings are designed with precision and detail in mind for any ring variation you choose. Here's some of the steps we've taken to ensure the quality of your ring. Consistent ring sizing across all materials  Materials tend to expand when they are 3D printed. The computer code compensates for these changes to calculate an accurate sizing for each ring. Advanced 3D Printability checks that ensure design integrity  Each 3D model goes through a digital quality check to ensure that it can withstand the 3D printing process.  Manual Inspections  Finally, each ring will be inspected by hand and thoroughly checked for abnormalities before being shipped to a backer.  Not Sure About Your Ring Size? No Problem!The Prodigy Ring has tons of uses that go beyond jewelry, but if you intend on wearing your customized ring then you’ll need to know your ring size.The most accurate way to determine your ring size is by making a stop to any local jewelry store for a free sizing which only takes a couple minutes. But there are plenty of other ways you can determine your ring size from the comfort of your own home. Take a look these Design Guidelines to learn more!  Reward tiers are determined based on your choice of material. From there you can choose any other customization options you like; there is no additional fee for your choice of Band Style, Ring Size, Charm, Custom Message, or Font. Customization choices will be taken via email          The money from this campaign will be put into reward fulfillment and helping me launch my business. It will also go into buying advanced 3D printing equipment that would help me test new designs so that I can offer them to the public faster. I have many more ideas that I'd like to share with you all, so please, help make this dream a reality! About the Creator  My name is Allan! I'm a mechanical engineer based in Arlington Virginia. I received my B.E. from Vanderbilt University in 2014 and the following year I got my M.S. in Technology Entrepreneurship at the University of Notre Dame. When I'm not designing jewelry I can be found watching anime, teaching 3D modeling, or building things at my local TechShop.  This Kickstarter means more to me than just selling goods: it's about me finally getting to share my skill and passion with the world. It's about technology, it's about teaching, and most importantly it's about every one of us. We all have innately unique and beautiful things about ourselves which deserve to be celebrated, because each of us is a Prodigy in our own right.  So one question remains: What will you create?     Links to my personal pages:",34.0,9,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p>Hello !  </p>
<p>We are Frederic Leuba and Pascal Robert, founders of MUSE Swiss Art watches. We started our journey with this project in early 2016 and we have enjoyed every minute of it so far. We are delighted and proud to present our creations.  </p>
<p>Our MUSE watches are both reliable timepieces and jewelery with a totally unique and innovative design. Our new concept replaces traditional hands in favor of finely crafted patterns that run at the speed of hours, minutes and seconds, generating compositions in perpetual motion, offering you a true living art.  </p>
<p>We aim to raise funds to produce our watches in Switzerland with the highest quality materials, such as titanium and natural stones and equip them with a 1969’s""collector"" movement. Our goal is to offer you a product of luxury with innovative design and the fairest price. That's why we want to be in direct contact with you on kickstarter.  </p>
<p>Our products are aimed at all those who understand and appreciate the art of watchmaking and design and are looking for an exclusive and innovative Swiss automatic mechanical watch with the highest degree of know-how and quality of materials.  </p>
<p>Both watch engineers, we have been working in this industry since 1995.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read us. We hope you will share with us the adventure of MUSE and we look forward to counting you among our fervent supporters.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The power of the present moment:  </p>
<p>As our name suggests, our watches are designed to inspire their wearers, whether male or female. In a hyper-connected world that is constantly accelerating, MUSE watches are a poetic and artistic reminder of the need to take a step back to relax and connect with the essentials. That's why we've replaced traditional hands with finely crafted patterns that evolve over time and create compositions in perpetual movement. This show is an invitation to open a parenthesis, to pause, and to live at a more natural rhythm, that of the present moment.  </p>
<p>Swiss watchmaking know-how:  </p>
<p>Our watches are born in the Vaudoises mountains. They were imagined, designed, assembled and tested between St Cergue and La Chaux-de-Fonds. They are dozens of passionate craftsmen, working in different trades, who helped us to give them life. For them, as for us, quality and reliability are paramount principles. We thank them warmly and wish to pay homage to them with our creations which combine traditional mechanics and contemporary aesthetics.  </p>
<p>At the service of design:  </p>
<p>You may have noticed, our logo and the name of our brand do not even appear on the dial. We consider, in fact, that the purity of our design is more important than our advertising. We consider that the purity of our design and your reading comfort is more important than our advertising.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>For us, luxury is synonymous with rarity and high quality. Therefore, each MUSE Swiss Art watches model is limited to 100 pieces.  </p>
<p>You will receive your numbered watch according to your backer's number. It will be accompanied by a certificate of authenticity. You will be sure to own a rare and unique watch. </p>
<p>Our wish is that your MUSE becomes your talisman, personal and precious, carrying meaning and positive energies that will accompany you everywhere</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The muse watches are dressed with two 44mm or 37mm titanium case. We chose titanium for two reasons. first of all for its lightness and therefore its comfort of use and on the other hand its high resistance which ensures excellent longevity.  </p>
<p>Our two cases are adorned with two sapphire crystal treated with a double antireflection coating that allows you to admire, in the best possible way, the stone dial and the finely chiselled patterns, real lace, which replace the traditional hands.  </p>
<p>The crown is screwed and provides excellent sealing for this kind of watch (50m / 165 feet).  </p>
<p>The finishes play with the contrasts of polish, satin and micro-blasted for a refined and elegant rendering.</p>

<p>At the heart of each of our models beats the self-winding mechanical caliber ETA 2776. A historic movement, created in 1969 and whose production has stopped since 1982. We had the heart to revive this treasure asleep by reworking several hundred kits, carefully guarded for decades by a collector. We equipped it with a 21,600 (3Hz) oscillator so as to favor the power reserve. This is 48 hours minimum. </p>
<p>Embellished with black rhodium, its finishes are unique: ""côtes circulaires"", graining, diamond-cut edge and a sunny finishes on the oscillating weight whose engraving remembers the logo of the brand. We have renamed it, Caliber MUSE ""MU 01"".</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Our six models are equipped with Onyx and aventurine dials. These semi-precious materials are found in many prestigious watches. They also echo our philosophy by bringing you their protective benefits.  </p>
<p>If we cross the bar of 100,000 CHF we will offer two other types of stones: Picasso jasper and red jasper. The watches equipped with these dials will have a price equivalent to the models with onyx dial. Choose your watch now and you can choose one of these dials later.</p>

<p>Hello ! </p>
<p>Nous sommes Frederic Leuba et Pascal Robert, fondateurs de MUSE Swiss Art watches. Nous avons commencé notre voyage avec ce projet au début de l'année 2016 et nous en avons aimé chaque minute, jusqu'à présent. Nous sommes ravis et fiers de vous présenter nos créations. </p>
<p>Nos montres MUSE sont à la fois des garde-temps fiables et des bijoux au design totalement unique et innovant. Notre nouveau concept fait disparaître les aiguilles traditionnelles au profit de motifs finement ouvragés qui tournent à la vitesse des heures, des minutes et des secondes, générant des compositions en perpétuel mouvement, vous offrant ainsi un véritable art vivant. </p>
<p>Nous cherchons à lever des fonds pour produire nos montres en Suisse avec des matériaux de la plus haute qualité, comme le titane et les pierres naturelles et les équiper d’un mouvement « collector » de 1969. Notre but est de vous offrir un produit de luxe au design novateur et au prix le plus juste. C'est pour cela que nous cherchons à être en lien direct avec vous, sur kickstarter. </p>
<p>Nos produits s’adressent à toutes celles et ceux qui comprennent et apprécient l'art de l'horlogerie et du design et recherchent une montre mécanique automatique suisse, exclusive et innovante, avec le plus haut degré de savoir-faire et de qualité des matériaux. </p>
<p>Tous les deux ingénieurs horlogers, nous œuvrons dans cette industrie depuis 1995. </p>
<p>Merci d’avoir pris le temps de nous lire. Nous espérons que vous partagerez avec nous l’aventure de MUSE et nous nous réjouissons de vous compter parmi nos fervents supporters.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>La puissance du moment présent :  </p>
<p>Comme notre nom l’évoque, nos montres ont pour ambition d’inspirer leurs porteurs, qu'ils soient masculins ou féminins. Dans un monde hyper connecté qui accélère sans cesse, les montres MUSE rappellent de manière poétique et artistique, la nécessité de prendre un peu de recul pour se ressourcer et se relier à l’essentiel. C’est pourquoi nous avons remplacé les aiguilles traditionnelles par des motifs finement ouvragés qui évoluent au fil du temps et dessinent des compositions en perpétuel mouvement. Ce spectacle est une invitation à ouvrir une parenthèse, se poser, et vivre à un rythme plus naturel, celui de l’instant présent.  </p>
<p>Le savoir-faire horloger Suisse :  </p>
<p>Nos montres sont nées dans les montagnes Vaudoises. Elles ont été imaginées, conçues, assemblées et testées entre St Cergue et la Chaux-de-fonds. Ce sont des dizaines d’artisans passionnés, œuvrant dans différents corps de métier, qui nous ont aidés à leur donner vie. Pour eux comme pour nous la qualité et la fiabilité sont des principes primordiaux. Nous les remercions vivement et souhaitons leur rendre hommage avec nos créations qui allient mécanique traditionnelle et esthétique contemporaine.  </p>
<p>Au service du design : </p>
<p>Vous vous en êtes peut-être aperçu, notre logo et le nom de notre marque n'apparaissent même pas sur le cadran. Nous considérons en effet, que la pureté de notre design et votre confort de lecture sont plus important que notre publicité.</p>
<p> </p>
<div data-id=""20393428""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1522337145/lnkztdc56bvy0qefkvcu.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<p> </p>
<p>Pour nous, luxe rime avec rareté et haute qualité. Par conséquent, chaque modèle de montre MUSE Swiss Art watches est limité à 100 pièces.  </p>
<p>Vous recevrez votre montre numérotée selon votre ordre d’arrivée de contributeurs. Elle sera accompagné d’un certificat d’authenticité. </p>
<p>Vous serez ainsi sûr de posséder une montre rare et unique. Notre souhait est que votre MUSE devienne votre talisman, personnel et précieux, porteur de sens et d’énergies positives qui vous accompagnera partout.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Les montres MUSE sont habillées avec deux boîtiers en titane de 44mm ou 37mm. Nous avons choisi le titane pour deux raisons. D’une part sa légèreté, donc son confort d’utilisation, et d’autre part sa haute résistance qui assure une excellente longévité.    </p>
<p>Nos deux boîtiers sont équipés de deux verres saphir traités avec un double antireflet qui vous permet d’admirer de la meilleure façon possible le cadran en pierre et les motifs ouvragés, véritable dentelles qui remplacent les aiguilles traditionnelles.  </p>
<div>
<p>La couronne est vissée et assure une excellente étanchéité pour ce genre de montre (50m / 165 feet).  </p>
<p>Les finitions jouent avec les contrastes du poli, du satiné et du microbillé pour un rendu raffiné et élégant.</p>

<p>Au cœur de chacun de nos modèles bat le calibre mécanique à remontage automatique ETA 2776. Un mouvement historique, créé en 1969 et dont la production a cessé depuis 1982. </p>
<p>Nous avons eu à cœur de réanimer ce trésor endormi en retravaillant plusieurs centaines de kits, précieusement gardés durant des décennies, par un collectionneur. Nous l’avons équipé d’un oscillateur à 21'600 alternances (3Hz) de façon à privilégier la réserve de marche. Celle-ci est de 48h minimum. </p>
<p>Paré de rhodium noir, ses finitions sont inédites : côtes circulaires, angles diamantés et une masse oscillante ensoleillée dont la gravure rappelle le logo de la marque. Nous l'avons renommé Calibre MUSE ""MU 01"".</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Nos six modèles sont équipés de cadran en pierre naturelle semi-précieuse, soit en onyx, soit en aventurine. Ces matières équipent parfois des montres de prestige. Elles viennent aussi faire écho à notre philosophie en vous apportant leurs bienfaits protecteurs.   </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Si nous franchissons la barre des 100'000 CHF (91'000€) nous vous proposerons deux autres pierres semi-précieuses elles aussi : la jaspe Picasso et la jaspe rouge. Les montres équipées de ces cadrans auront un prix équivalent au modèle équipé d'un cadran en onyx. Choisissez votre montre maintenant et vous pourrez choisir l’un ou l’autre de ces cadrans après la campagne.</p>

Hello !  
We are Frederic Leuba and Pascal Robert, founders of MUSE Swiss Art watches. We started our journey with this project in early 2016 and we have enjoyed every minute of it so far. We are delighted and proud to present our creations.  
Our MUSE watches are both reliable timepieces and jewelery with a totally unique and innovative design. Our new concept replaces traditional hands in favor of finely crafted patterns that run at the speed of hours, minutes and seconds, generating compositions in perpetual motion, offering you a true living art.  
We aim to raise funds to produce our watches in Switzerland with the highest quality materials, such as titanium and natural stones and equip them with a 1969’s""collector"" movement. Our goal is to offer you a product of luxury with innovative design and the fairest price. That's why we want to be in direct contact with you on kickstarter.  
Our products are aimed at all those who understand and appreciate the art of watchmaking and design and are looking for an exclusive and innovative Swiss automatic mechanical watch with the highest degree of know-how and quality of materials.  
Both watch engineers, we have been working in this industry since 1995.
Thank you for taking the time to read us. We hope you will share with us the adventure of MUSE and we look forward to counting you among our fervent supporters.
 
STELLA - PVD Red-gold - Aventurine Dial - 37mm
 


 
The power of the present moment:  
As our name suggests, our watches are designed to inspire their wearers, whether male or female. In a hyper-connected world that is constantly accelerating, MUSE watches are a poetic and artistic reminder of the need to take a step back to relax and connect with the essentials. That's why we've replaced traditional hands with finely crafted patterns that evolve over time and create compositions in perpetual movement. This show is an invitation to open a parenthesis, to pause, and to live at a more natural rhythm, that of the present moment.  
Swiss watchmaking know-how:  
Our watches are born in the Vaudoises mountains. They were imagined, designed, assembled and tested between St Cergue and La Chaux-de-Fonds. They are dozens of passionate craftsmen, working in different trades, who helped us to give them life. For them, as for us, quality and reliability are paramount principles. We thank them warmly and wish to pay homage to them with our creations which combine traditional mechanics and contemporary aesthetics.  
At the service of design:  
You may have noticed, our logo and the name of our brand do not even appear on the dial. We consider, in fact, that the purity of our design is more important than our advertising. We consider that the purity of our design and your reading comfort is more important than our advertising.
 


 
For us, luxury is synonymous with rarity and high quality. Therefore, each MUSE Swiss Art watches model is limited to 100 pieces.  
You will receive your numbered watch according to your backer's number. It will be accompanied by a certificate of authenticity. You will be sure to own a rare and unique watch. 
Our wish is that your MUSE becomes your talisman, personal and precious, carrying meaning and positive energies that will accompany you everywhere
 

 

 
The muse watches are dressed with two 44mm or 37mm titanium case. We chose titanium for two reasons. first of all for its lightness and therefore its comfort of use and on the other hand its high resistance which ensures excellent longevity.  
Our two cases are adorned with two sapphire crystal treated with a double antireflection coating that allows you to admire, in the best possible way, the stone dial and the finely chiselled patterns, real lace, which replace the traditional hands.  
The crown is screwed and provides excellent sealing for this kind of watch (50m / 165 feet).  
The finishes play with the contrasts of polish, satin and micro-blasted for a refined and elegant rendering.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MUSE Caliber MU01 - 3Hz - 48h PWR - 25 Jewels
At the heart of each of our models beats the self-winding mechanical caliber ETA 2776. A historic movement, created in 1969 and whose production has stopped since 1982. We had the heart to revive this treasure asleep by reworking several hundred kits, carefully guarded for decades by a collector. We equipped it with a 21,600 (3Hz) oscillator so as to favor the power reserve. This is 48 hours minimum. 
Embellished with black rhodium, its finishes are unique: ""côtes circulaires"", graining, diamond-cut edge and a sunny finishes on the oscillating weight whose engraving remembers the logo of the brand. We have renamed it, Caliber MUSE ""MU 01"".
 


 
Our six models are equipped with Onyx and aventurine dials. These semi-precious materials are found in many prestigious watches. They also echo our philosophy by bringing you their protective benefits.  
If we cross the bar of 100,000 CHF we will offer two other types of stones: Picasso jasper and red jasper. The watches equipped with these dials will have a price equivalent to the models with onyx dial. Choose your watch now and you can choose one of these dials later.

Hello ! 
Nous sommes Frederic Leuba et Pascal Robert, fondateurs de MUSE Swiss Art watches. Nous avons commencé notre voyage avec ce projet au début de l'année 2016 et nous en avons aimé chaque minute, jusqu'à présent. Nous sommes ravis et fiers de vous présenter nos créations. 
Nos montres MUSE sont à la fois des garde-temps fiables et des bijoux au design totalement unique et innovant. Notre nouveau concept fait disparaître les aiguilles traditionnelles au profit de motifs finement ouvragés qui tournent à la vitesse des heures, des minutes et des secondes, générant des compositions en perpétuel mouvement, vous offrant ainsi un véritable art vivant. 
Nous cherchons à lever des fonds pour produire nos montres en Suisse avec des matériaux de la plus haute qualité, comme le titane et les pierres naturelles et les équiper d’un mouvement « collector » de 1969. Notre but est de vous offrir un produit de luxe au design novateur et au prix le plus juste. C'est pour cela que nous cherchons à être en lien direct avec vous, sur kickstarter. 
Nos produits s’adressent à toutes celles et ceux qui comprennent et apprécient l'art de l'horlogerie et du design et recherchent une montre mécanique automatique suisse, exclusive et innovante, avec le plus haut degré de savoir-faire et de qualité des matériaux. 
Tous les deux ingénieurs horlogers, nous œuvrons dans cette industrie depuis 1995. 
Merci d’avoir pris le temps de nous lire. Nous espérons que vous partagerez avec nous l’aventure de MUSE et nous nous réjouissons de vous compter parmi nos fervents supporters.

La puissance du moment présent :  
Comme notre nom l’évoque, nos montres ont pour ambition d’inspirer leurs porteurs, qu'ils soient masculins ou féminins. Dans un monde hyper connecté qui accélère sans cesse, les montres MUSE rappellent de manière poétique et artistique, la nécessité de prendre un peu de recul pour se ressourcer et se relier à l’essentiel. C’est pourquoi nous avons remplacé les aiguilles traditionnelles par des motifs finement ouvragés qui évoluent au fil du temps et dessinent des compositions en perpétuel mouvement. Ce spectacle est une invitation à ouvrir une parenthèse, se poser, et vivre à un rythme plus naturel, celui de l’instant présent.  
Le savoir-faire horloger Suisse :  
Nos montres sont nées dans les montagnes Vaudoises. Elles ont été imaginées, conçues, assemblées et testées entre St Cergue et la Chaux-de-fonds. Ce sont des dizaines d’artisans passionnés, œuvrant dans différents corps de métier, qui nous ont aidés à leur donner vie. Pour eux comme pour nous la qualité et la fiabilité sont des principes primordiaux. Nous les remercions vivement et souhaitons leur rendre hommage avec nos créations qui allient mécanique traditionnelle et esthétique contemporaine.  
Au service du design : 
Vous vous en êtes peut-être aperçu, notre logo et le nom de notre marque n'apparaissent même pas sur le cadran. Nous considérons en effet, que la pureté de notre design et votre confort de lecture sont plus important que notre publicité.
 


 
Pour nous, luxe rime avec rareté et haute qualité. Par conséquent, chaque modèle de montre MUSE Swiss Art watches est limité à 100 pièces.  
Vous recevrez votre montre numérotée selon votre ordre d’arrivée de contributeurs. Elle sera accompagné d’un certificat d’authenticité. 
Vous serez ainsi sûr de posséder une montre rare et unique. Notre souhait est que votre MUSE devienne votre talisman, personnel et précieux, porteur de sens et d’énergies positives qui vous accompagnera partout.
 


 
Les montres MUSE sont habillées avec deux boîtiers en titane de 44mm ou 37mm. Nous avons choisi le titane pour deux raisons. D’une part sa légèreté, donc son confort d’utilisation, et d’autre part sa haute résistance qui assure une excellente longévité.    
Nos deux boîtiers sont équipés de deux verres saphir traités avec un double antireflet qui vous permet d’admirer de la meilleure façon possible le cadran en pierre et les motifs ouvragés, véritable dentelles qui remplacent les aiguilles traditionnelles.  

La couronne est vissée et assure une excellente étanchéité pour ce genre de montre (50m / 165 feet).  
Les finitions jouent avec les contrastes du poli, du satiné et du microbillé pour un rendu raffiné et élégant.
 


 
Au cœur de chacun de nos modèles bat le calibre mécanique à remontage automatique ETA 2776. Un mouvement historique, créé en 1969 et dont la production a cessé depuis 1982. 
Nous avons eu à cœur de réanimer ce trésor endormi en retravaillant plusieurs centaines de kits, précieusement gardés durant des décennies, par un collectionneur. Nous l’avons équipé d’un oscillateur à 21'600 alternances (3Hz) de façon à privilégier la réserve de marche. Celle-ci est de 48h minimum. 
Paré de rhodium noir, ses finitions sont inédites : côtes circulaires, angles diamantés et une masse oscillante ensoleillée dont la gravure rappelle le logo de la marque. Nous l'avons renommé Calibre MUSE ""MU 01"".
 


 
Nos six modèles sont équipés de cadran en pierre naturelle semi-précieuse, soit en onyx, soit en aventurine. Ces matières équipent parfois des montres de prestige. Elles viennent aussi faire écho à notre philosophie en vous apportant leurs bienfaits protecteurs.   


Si nous franchissons la barre des 100'000 CHF (91'000€) nous vous proposerons deux autres pierres semi-précieuses elles aussi : la jaspe Picasso et la jaspe rouge. Les montres équipées de ces cadrans auront un prix équivalent au modèle équipé d'un cadran en onyx. Choisissez votre montre maintenant et vous pourrez choisir l’un ou l’autre de ces cadrans après la campagne.
