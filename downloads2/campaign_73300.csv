After shaking your head in disbelief, you think to yourself: “just one more
thing I am not looking forward to dealing with this weekend.” 
THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY

As the inventor of ProFix and 20-year veteran in the windshield repair industry, I discovered the current way of repairing a cracked windshield yourself was too time-consuming and confusing. Not to mention, the products are not reusable and can leave a mark, increasing the chances of the crack returning. All that changes with ProFix – the most advanced DIY equipment ever made and the only one that uses the patented cartridge technology. 


With
ProFix, you don’t have to replace the equipment after every use, just the
cartridge.  ProFix comes with a new line of accessories like the corner
adapter that helps reach places on the windshield competing products can’t
reach; or the big pit adapter when faced with an oversized chip that is too
large for regular DIY equipment. 


HOW DOES PROFIX WORK?



Pro Fix’s DIY Windshield Repair Kit
works like this: 


Take out the ProFix unit from its hard-carrying
case. Attach the base to the cylinder.  Take
out the UV cartridge, remove the tape at the bottom and insert it in to the
unit.

Attach the ProFix unit to the glass and place it
over the center of the pit.

Screw the cylinder all the way to the glass
using the suction cups to secure it to the surface.  


Once secured, unscrew the plunger upwards through
the cylinder. This is when the air gets extracted from the windshield chip.


Apply the UV cartridge by pushing down on the
plunger. This activates the cartridge inside the cylinder by pushing the resin
down to the bottom of the cylinder and then applying pressure by screwing the
plunger downwards and putting force behind the resin and pushing it into the
break. 

Following this process will allow for
the resin to remain free from contaminants. The cartridge keeps the resin away
from the air extraction process until it is ready to be injected into the
crack.

<h3><b>Story - Bamboo &amp; Why </b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Antti and thank you for your time. My partner Jason and I started
this venture 1 year ago in the beginning of 2015 and we have slowly worked up
to now where we believe our idea is good enough to be presented to everyone.
Both he and I worked in Corporate after we graduated University and we ended up
working in the field of exports and quality control. I was a chief project
manager of a large European retailer and my partner was likewise for a large
supermarket retailer from the United States. We were both in China in the field
of enforcing quality control and environmental standards for export products.
Over the few years we saw many inspirational stories of businesses and
individuals making a difference as well as many problematic issues that we are
facing in the degradation of the environment. Over the years we became good
friends and one day we two decided to do something for ourselves, but we
decided it must be something that not only reflects our personal values but
also something that peaked our interests and that we have a passion for. </p>
<p>For over half a year we were brain storming but we honestly had no idea
until we were both invited to a wedding in Anji China. Anji is well known in
China for being “the land of bamboo” for its natural bamboo surroundings to
also being one of the largest bamboo cultivation areas in China, we however had
no idea at the time. Being hospitable, our friend introduced us to his hometown
and their specialty which is bamboo cultivation and processes. We quickly
realized that there were many products already substituted by bamboo but not
many if at all for our household goods. </p>
<p>For about a year now, me and my partner have been developing slowly our
product line and designs and we have made concepts and sample products. We have
also launched a basic website and have taken some photos and we believe we are
ready to take the next step. Our goal is to push the idea of this material into
the western market and explain to both businesses and consumers the benefits of
using this material as a substitute and alternative to plastic. Not only is it
more green and ecofriendly we found that we can also match the pricing of all
the current plastic products on the market. Our thinking is; if
the quality is the same and it is better for the environment for an equal
price, then why not give it a try? </p>

</div><div>
<p>We will use the stated funds for production of our product line, with the goal of selling our designs  directly to our consumers in the United States and Europe, online and eventually in stores as well. We will use the funds to manufacture our product line and for operational costs  in the United States. </p>
<p><b>Any funding past our states goal we will use to</b> </p>
<p>1) attend trade fairs to present and promote our idea, with this we can convince larger retailers of our idea and give us a try. </p>
<p>2) Establish more partner stores either online or offline to build a network for distribution.</p>
<p>With that we hope the bamboo material and its use as an
Eco-friendly alternative will increase.</p>
<p>The greatest advantage we have is that our cost
of production can be matched to our competitors in plastic and our idea simply
offers the consumers a choice. We believe that retailers would view products
offering consumers more choices as a good thing, and people would like the idea of an alternative biodegradable material to replace plastics but that also doesn't burn a hole in our wallets. </p>
<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;""><h4><b>Introduction – What is IRRI, What Are Our Products?</b></h4>
</b></h3>
<p><b>  </b>IRRI is the name of the brand that my partner and I created over a year
ago and it holds a special meaning to us. It represents to us our concept of
using new ideas to face the problems of the future generation. We always
believed in the green concept but that it also should be cost effective for the
consumer and sustainable economically as well, so we decided to use bamboo as
an ecofriendly alternative to plastic for our essential everyday household goods.
Many of us already know about the environmental problems that we all face from
the overuse of plastics, and because plastic is non-biodegradable it eventually
ends up in huge piles within our oceans. Bamboo contrary to most peoples
initial perception is not a tree but rather a grass, and because of this bamboo
grows at an exponentially faster rate and is one of the world’s fastest growing
plants. Because of this, bamboo can be cultivated on farms which can be
harvested seasonally like our food and vegetables. Bamboo has already started
substituting hardwoods as an alternative solution to deforestation and soil
erosion in the United States and we hope to take the concept one step further.
(You can read about this in detail within the FAQ below) </p>
<p>Our products consists of our own designs of
everyday household goods using 100% biodegradable bamboo fiber material. We
started with dining items (cups, forks, plates) etc and a children’s set we are
very proud of. We also made smaller standalone items such as coffee cups and
compartment trays for organization and snacks. We hope to expand to much more
categories as we grow and mature. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Bamboos Properties and how it Effects Quality</b></p>
<p>§<span> 
</span>Bamboo has a higher compression strength
then wood, brick and concrete and its tensile strength is similar to that of
steel.</p>
<p>§<span> 
</span>Due to the durability of bamboo plants,
no pesticides or chemicals are needed to encourage the maturation process, and
they require much less water than trees.</p>
<p>§<span> 
</span>Bamboo products are 100% decomposable
naturally. Once they do, they return and eventually become reusable in the form
of nutrient-rich composted soil. This is in stark contrast to the plastics
which we use now, which cannot be processed by nature and so it accumulates in
garbage dumps and eventually into our oceans. </p>

</h3>
</div><div> <p></p>
<p><b>Where We Get Our Bamboo</b></p>
<p>Our bamboo is cultivated and grown in Anji County Zhejiang
China. We make sure for our products, we only order bamboo from
certified cultivation center that grow and harvest on its own farm. This way we can guarantee that we are not buying bamboo from illegally harvested
areas such as environmental projects that are fighting soil erosion. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Our Promise of Transparency</b></p>
<p>We want to be as transparent as possible with
our project and so once we make production we will publicly publish our costs
of production on our website. We also promise to document our experience at the
trade fair and show how we used your contributions to help us advance our
stated goal. Both Antii and I having most of our experiences in manufacturing
and quality control understands the consumers worry over ethical standards as
well as quality. This is why we believe as a standard of our new global &amp;
digital world to be as transparent as possible every step of the way. We
believe it is the only way to gain and maintain the trust of our customers
which is our ultimate goal. </p>

  Finally,
we promise to take all our contributors opinions to heart as you are the ones
that make it possible, so we are open to new products and items that you would
like to see and we would be happy to try make it for you guys. Ultimately the
goal is to have a dialogue with all the people that believed in us and our
idea, we believe that its about building a community and slowly but surely that
is our way to success</div><div>

no idea at the time. Being hospitable, our friend introduced us to his hometown
and their specialty which is bamboo cultivation and processes. We quickly
realized that there were many products already substituted by bamboo but not
many if at all for our household goods. 
For about a year now, me and my partner have been developing slowly our
product line and designs and we have made concepts and sample products. We have
also launched a basic website and have taken some photos and we believe we are
ready to take the next step. Our goal is to push the idea of this material into
the western market and explain to both businesses and consumers the benefits of
using this material as a substitute and alternative to plastic. Not only is it
more green and ecofriendly we found that we can also match the pricing of all
the current plastic products on the market. Our thinking is; if
the quality is the same and it is better for the environment for an equal
price, then why not give it a try?

How we Will Use The Funding

We will use the stated funds for production of our product line, with the goal of selling our designs  directly to our consumers in the United States and Europe, online and eventually in stores as well. We will use the funds to manufacture our product line and for operational costs  in the United States. 
Any funding past our states goal we will use to 
1) attend trade fairs to present and promote our idea, with this we can convince larger retailers of our idea and give us a try. 
2) Establish more partner stores either online or offline to build a network for distribution.
With that we hope the bamboo material and its use as an
Eco-friendly alternative will increase.
The greatest advantage we have is that our cost
of production can be matched to our competitors in plastic and our idea simply
offers the consumers a choice. We believe that retailers would view products
offering consumers more choices as a good thing, and people would like the idea of an alternative biodegradable material to replace plastics but that also doesn't burn a hole in our wallets. 
    Introduction – What is IRRI, What Are Our Products?

  IRRI is the name of the brand that my partner and I created over a year
ago and it holds a special meaning to us. It represents to us our concept of
using new ideas to face the problems of the future generation. We always
believed in the green concept but that it also should be cost effective for the
consumer and sustainable economically as well, so we decided to use bamboo as
an ecofriendly alternative to plastic for our essential everyday household goods.
Many of us already know about the environmental problems that we all face from
the overuse of plastics, and because plastic is non-biodegradable it eventually
ends up in huge piles within our oceans. Bamboo contrary to most peoples
initial perception is not a tree but rather a grass, and because of this bamboo
grows at an exponentially faster rate and is one of the world’s fastest growing
plants. Because of this, bamboo can be cultivated on farms which can be
harvested seasonally like our food and vegetables. Bamboo has already started
substituting hardwoods as an alternative solution to deforestation and soil
erosion in the United States and we hope to take the concept one step further.
(You can read about this in detail within the FAQ below) 
Our products consists of our own designs of
everyday household goods using 100% biodegradable bamboo fiber material. We
started with dining items (cups, forks, plates) etc and a children’s set we are
very proud of. We also made smaller standalone items such as coffee cups and
compartment trays for organization and snacks. We hope to expand to much more
categories as we grow and mature. 

Bamboos Properties and how it Effects Quality
§ 
Bamboo has a higher compression strength
then wood, brick and concrete and its tensile strength is similar to that of
steel.
§ 
Due to the durability of bamboo plants,
no pesticides or chemicals are needed to encourage the maturation process, and
they require much less water than trees.
§ 
Bamboo products are 100% decomposable
naturally. Once they do, they return and eventually become reusable in the form
of nutrient-rich composted soil. This is in stark contrast to the plastics
which we use now, which cannot be processed by nature and so it accumulates in
garbage dumps and eventually into our oceans.

Risks & Challenges

 
Where We Get Our Bamboo
Our bamboo is cultivated and grown in Anji County Zhejiang
China. We make sure for our products, we only order bamboo from
certified cultivation center that grow and harvest on its own farm. This way we can guarantee that we are not buying bamboo from illegally harvested
areas such as environmental projects that are fighting soil erosion. 

Our Promise of Transparency
We want to be as transparent as possible with
our project and so once we make production we will publicly publish our costs
of production on our website. We also promise to document our experience at the
trade fair and show how we used your contributions to help us advance our
stated goal. Both Antii and I having most of our experiences in manufacturing
and quality control understands the consumers worry over ethical standards as
well as quality. This is why we believe as a standard of our new global &
digital world to be as transparent as possible every step of the way. We
believe it is the only way to gain and maintain the trust of our customers
which is our ultimate goal. 

  Finally,
we promise to take all our contributors opinions to heart as you are the ones
that make it possible, so we are open to new products and items that you would
like to see and we would be happy to try make it for you guys. Ultimately the
goal is to have a dialogue with all the people that believed in us and our
idea, we believe that its about building a community and slowly but surely that
is our way to success

loop. This combined with effective composting creates a farming system with very little waste. This ultimately means aquaponic systems produce more pounds of food per acre than traditional farms, while greatly reducing the environmental impact.  Because the systems can be housed inside of greenhouses, aquaponics will allow us to produce organic food locally, and consistently regardless of seasonal and/or climate changes. </span></span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459190450/wy7iw9ejo4dzjx6tfjih.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">For Example, ""</span><a href=""http://www.growingpower.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Growing Power</a><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">"" (an established 3 acre aquaponic farm) in Milwaukee WI,  currently generates 1 Million pounds of fresh organic produce, over 10,000 fish and 500 cubic yards of compost each year.  We would hope to eventually match if not exceed these numbers per acre, based on our favorable climate and sun here in AZ.</span><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459188990/pshtplmm7cs7ttjmvlho.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Pictured above: Inside of a Growing Power greenhouse, in Milwaukee WI<div>

<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The Plan</b><br/></p>
<p>The mission of <b>Pannke Farm</b> is to sustainably and efficiently raise and grow a variety of healthy organic fish and produce, to supply our local community, restaurants, and markets. We aim to educate and will partner with groups, schools and universities for tours and field trips, as well as internships and research.  </p>
<p>These funds will be used to purchase land, and to set up the farm and aquaponic systems.  Our goal by mid-late summer 2016 is to have our initial greenhouses and aquaponics systems up and running. We aim to then begin our first harvests of produce, followed by fish starting in the fall and winter of '16. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The small bed and breakfast will be built during these months, and opened after the farm is established and productive.  R</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">enting cabins on site will allow us to offer guests a chance to experience and learn from our aquaponic farm first hand, for days or weeks at a time. We hope to have the B&amp;B with cabins up and running in early to mid 2017.</span></p>
<p>As the land we develop will also serve as our home we plan to develop a small area into a homestead.  There we will set up our personal gardens and small greenhouses, as well as raise our own goats and chickens that will provide us with fresh milk and eggs.</p>
<p>Our goal is to become a leader in the innovation and implementation of aquaponics systems, but we need to start small.  We aim to help the movement in any way we can as local and sustainable agriculture spreads around the world.</p>

</div></div>","Brothers And FoundersWe are Michael and Sean Pannke, and we need your help to start a family run Aquaponic farm and fish hatchery in Flagstaff, AZ.  The $200,000 will go towards purchasing farm land, building greenhouses, aquaponic systems, and much much more.We were exposed to urban farming while attending college in Milwaukee, WI where we were amazed and inspired by the positive impact Growing Power had on our city.   Following this inspiration, we successfully designed and built our home an aquaponics system, and had great success growing greens and other produce as well as breeding fish on a small scale.  The projects instilled in us even more passion for sustainable agriculture, and that is why we need your help, in order to expand these principals into a profitable commercial aquaponic farm.  These experiences have been driving forces behind our desire to spread the same type of community supported agriculture to yet another wonderful city.  Your donation to our cause, no matter how big or how small, will be used to build and work towards a more sustainable future for us all.Flagstaff is a great place to live, to work and to visit.  It's surrounded by beautiful mountains and forests, and has a thriving local community who are dedicated to forward thinking and sustainability.  There is, however, a growing demand here (as in most cities) for more sustainable and local agriculture.  By supporting the creation of Pannke Farm, you'll help us fill in the void and supply fresh local produce and fish to our northern Arizona community and charities, as well as the many restaurants, grocers and markets also doing business here.Aquaponic farming will allow us to be productive and innovative throughout the year, while constantly reinvesting in the local community through education, volunteer work, and food donations.  Our farm will not only serve as a home for us, but also as a small bed and breakfast for people interested in an immersive experience at our farm. What is 'Aquaponics'?Aquaponics is a farming system symbiotically combines both aquaculture (fish farming) and hydroponics (growing plants without soil) to create a single, much more efficient system. This is made possible by the natural microbial process that breaks the down the toxins in fish waste into the nutrients plants need to thrive.  The plants and microbes act as a filter, providing the fish farm with purified water in a closed loop. This combined with effective composting creates a farming system with very little waste. This ultimately means aquaponic systems produce more pounds of food per acre than traditional farms, while greatly reducing the environmental impact.  Because the systems can be housed inside of greenhouses, aquaponics will allow us to produce organic food locally, and consistently regardless of seasonal and/or climate changes. For Example, ""Growing Power"" (an established 3 acre aquaponic farm) in Milwaukee WI,  currently generates 1 Million pounds of fresh organic produce, over 10,000 fish and 500 cubic yards of compost each year.  We would hope to eventually match if not exceed these numbers per acre, based on our favorable climate and sun here in AZ.Pictured above: Inside of a Growing Power greenhouse, in Milwaukee WI

Many Fish thrive in aquaponic systems, such as:


Tilapia
Perch (Pictured above)
Trout
Catfish
Bluegill, Crappie, & Sunfish
Colorful pet fish: Mollies, Platies, Swordtails, and Guppies
Ornimental Koi
Carp/Goldfish
Many more, including freshwater mussel and crayfish.


Plants that do well in Aquaponic systems include:


Leafy lettuce and greens
Basils and mints
Tomatos
Peppers
Watercress (is commonly fed to the fish)
Chives
Squash and cucumbers
Broccoli
Bananas, dwarf citrus trees, and so many more!


The Plan
The mission of Pannke Farm is to sustainably and efficiently raise and grow a variety of healthy organic fish and produce, to supply our local community, restaurants, and markets. We aim to educate and will partner with groups, schools and universities for tours and field trips, as well as internships and research.  
These funds will be used to purchase land, and to set up the farm and aquaponic systems.  Our goal by mid-late summer 2016 is to have our initial greenhouses and aquaponics systems up and running. We aim to then begin our first harvests of produce, followed by fish starting in the fall and winter of '16. 
The small bed and breakfast will be built during these months, and opened after the farm is established and productive.  Renting cabins on site will allow us to offer guests a chance to experience and learn from our aquaponic farm first hand, for days or weeks at a time. We hope to have the B&B with cabins up and running in early to mid 2017.
As the land we develop will also serve as our home we plan to develop a small area into a homestead.  There we will set up our personal gardens and small greenhouses, as well as raise our own goats and chickens that will provide us with fresh milk and eggs.
Our goal is to become a leader in the innovation and implementation of aquaponics systems, but we need to start small.  We aim to help the movement in any way we can as local and sustainable agriculture spreads around the world.





 What We Will Need the Funding for:


Land  (Expected Down payment of 20k+, as well as monthly mortgage, and yearly taxes)
Greenhouses and fish warehouses.  (Depending on size, pre-made commercial aquaponic set ups sell anywhere from: $10k-30k for the smaller systems, to more than $50k+ for large systems)

Fish fingerlings
Plants/seeds 
Multiple water cisterns ($1,399/3000Gal) and water delivery plumbing.
Septic system(s) (nat. average $4,600 ea.)
Roads cut and gravel laid (Average $2300/12'x50' of road)
Solar Panels ($900/panel) and Electrical systems
Living Spaces -For people: (30k for this log cabin) and for animals: (Chicken coop - $800 , 4X8 goat house $1,899)

Chickens and Goats

What began with a handle of clients grew into a carryout buried in a building with precarious parking. But the fervor for delicious healthy food prevailed and the much-needed next step is here - a new location that will meet the needs of an ever-growing demand for organic dishes. I have grown this business with nothing more than creativity and hard work, but now I need your support! A exciting part of this expansion will be the addition of a Healthy Belly Beverage Bar with tonics, elixirs, kombucha and teas. So what exactly will this new location mean for you? 

We Do The Cooking For You Whether you can’t cook for yourself or just don’t have the time to do so, canihaveabite provides a delicious solution. Our easy online menu makes ordering fast and simple and pick-up is easy and convenient. Once you get your dishes home they go from package to plate in a matter of minutes. Or you can dine in by choosing from our distinctive “Create Your Own” refrigerated case filled with dishes that are delicious alone, or can be combined to make your own perfect lunch/dinner. YOU will create your new favorite craving!

<p>I have been a user and add-on developer for SageTV since 2005 and have produced numerous plugins including a dynamic menu system (ADM).  A major development effort and improvement to SageTV has been the Gemstone UI replacement where I was one of the main developers (along with a great small team) as well as a contributor to the Phoenix services for SageTV. Now that SageTV has become an Open Source project, there are even more opportunities and challenges available.</p>
<p>Windows Installer: An important part of any project is ensuring new and current users can get up and running quickly and safely... therefore the need for a Windows Installer is high on my priority list.  This is key to the success of this Open Source project in order to bring on new users.</p>
<p>Gemstone 2.0: As existing users and new users ramp up their use of the Open Source SageTV, we need a solid and fresh UI that brings on new features, becomes mobile/tablet friendly and resolves any remaining issues raised from previous releases.</p>
<p>This project is Open Source so your contribution will go towards building a good testing and development environment to ensure the installer and Gemstone UI function well under numerous environments.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The major need for this project is my time and effort, however there are always investments to be made in hardware to assist in testing various scenarios for the installer and user interface changes.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help towards acquiring various hardware such as a HDHomeRun unit as well as various other devices for testing (small TV/Monitor, touch screen devices/tablets, Android Devices, etc.).</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary SageTV is a cross-platform networked DVR and media management system.
I have been a user and add-on developer for SageTV since 2005 and have produced numerous plugins including a dynamic menu system (ADM).  A major development effort and improvement to SageTV has been the Gemstone UI replacement where I was one of the main developers (along with a great small team) as well as a contributor to the Phoenix services for SageTV. Now that SageTV has become an Open Source project, there are even more opportunities and challenges available.
Windows Installer: An important part of any project is ensuring new and current users can get up and running quickly and safely... therefore the need for a Windows Installer is high on my priority list.  This is key to the success of this Open Source project in order to bring on new users.
Gemstone 2.0: As existing users and new users ramp up their use of the Open Source SageTV, we need a solid and fresh UI that brings on new features, becomes mobile/tablet friendly and resolves any remaining issues raised from previous releases.
This project is Open Source so your contribution will go towards building a good testing and development environment to ensure the installer and Gemstone UI function well under numerous environments.
  What We Need & What You Get The major need for this project is my time and effort, however there are always investments to be made in hardware to assist in testing various scenarios for the installer and user interface changes.
Your contributions will help towards acquiring various hardware such as a HDHomeRun unit as well as various other devices for testing (small TV/Monitor, touch screen devices/tablets, Android Devices, etc.).
Any remaining funds will be used as incentive to keep building a better SageTV Open Source product.
Along with your contribution suggest a special feature/function that you would like to see and I will do my best to move it up the priority list.
If the goal is not reached then I will use the funding to acquire hardware and keep working through my priorities as well as users suggestions to make the product better.    The Impact  SageTV is a solid yet highly customizable DVR solution that needs an even larger Community behind it.  Growth of the user base and community can only come from investing time and your contributions into a solid installer and a great user interface. My commitment to this great product will only be made stronger by your support and contributions.    Risks & Challenges Building a Windows Installer certainly has it's challenges with limitations by the toolsets available as well as the large number of existing SageTV installs with different hardware and OS versions.  My previous experience in this space is limited so I will commit to resolving issues as they are raised through the community to get a solid solution in place for installing SageTV on Windows.
The user interface as well can be challenging however this is an area where I have proven experience with a large group of existing users on the SageTV forum to attest to a great experience.  Changes to the UI to work better on tablets and other touch interfaces may require core changes as well that could be beyond my level of experience however this would just be another challenge to make the task more interesting. 
    Other Ways You Can Help For those who cannot contribute financially you can still help out through testing and suggesting features on the SageTV user forums as well as getting your friends and families to jump on the SageTV Open Source bandwagon.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</span>Summary</a></h1>
<p>For any cultural sector
to be dynamic it needs to maintain a high profile in community life. Young Norfolk
Islanders were traditionally raised in an environment that taught them their
local language, history and traditional knowledge and skills, but many ways of
passing on these traditions and skills are disappearing. Therefore, our school,
cultural organisations and civil society must now play a key role in protecting
and promoting our cultural heritage. The portrait photographs and Exhibition
entitled, ‘Faces of Norfolk: Spirit of Self-Determination’, will raise the
visibility of culture on Norfolk Island (NI).</p>
<p>The project will engage
a professional photographer to document a selection of members of the NI community.
Thirty-two (32) of the best of these portraits will be selected to comprise a 33
piece black and white collection. The Exhibition will be officially launched on
July, 2016 at the NI Centre for Democracy by the Norfolk Island People for Democracy
(NIPD). The date of July 1, 2016 is significant as this is the day the
Commonwealth ‘officially’ takes full control of Norfolk. The exhibited photos
will be compiled into a coffee table book, printed and available for sale. Both
exhibition entry fees and subsequent book sales will be used to as a sustainable
revenue base for the Centre for Democracy to enable it to continue its important
work on the Island. </p>
<p>An exhibition of 33 black
and white prints (40 x 50cm) will be developed for exhibition. These images
will represent a visual record of the people of NI in their fight for
self-determination.  This project also represents
a sound approach to achieving a goal of NIPD to protect and preserve NI heritage
for future generations. </p>
<h1><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">2.<span> 
</span>Background</a></h1>
<p>Norfolk Island was discovered in 1774 by Captain James Cook. Situated
between <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Australia</span></a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>New Zealand</span></a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>New Caledonia</span></a>, the Island
was originally settled to supply the new British colonies with flax and timber.
Between 1774 and 1856, the Island was used as two distinct penal colonies - the
second being the most brutal ever established by Britain.</p>
<p>In 1856 the island became the homeland of the Pitcairn Islanders, the
descendants of the Bounty Mutineers and their Tahitian wives who bought with
them to Norfolk, their own system of democratic self-government, and a distinct
language and culture<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[1]</span></span></a>.
Between 1856 and 1896 the Pitcairn Islanders continued their self-government,
until this right was taken from them. </p>
<p>Between 1896 and 1979 Norfolk’s affairs were administered first by the
Colony of New South Wales, and then after Australia's Federation, by the ‘Commonwealth’
of Australia. After a long crusade, the NI People were granted a limited form
of self-government in 1979.  </p>
<p>During this period of self-government, Norfolk supported itself
financially. However, as a result of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and
with tourism numbers down significantly in 2010, the Norfolk Island Government was
obligated to sign a ‘Road Map’ for change with the Commonwealth of Australia.
This agreement saw Norfolk dependant on funds provided only on the ‘condition’
of meeting milestones dictated by the Commonwealth through funding agreements. </p>
<p>Regardless of the views
of the NI community and the promised Road Map, the Commonwealth was already
moving to dissolve Norfolk’s democratic institutions through the Territories
Law Reform Act (2010). As a consequence, the Norfolk Island Legislative
Assembly and Government lost control over the Norfolk Island fiscus; and the
proposed laws passed by the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly became in all
cases subject to the approval of Australian authorities. </p>
<p>Finally, in 2015, the
Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Act abolished the NI Legislative Assembly
and placed the legislative and executive powers in the hands of the
Commonwealth. An unelected Advisory Council was appointed by the Federal
Minister. </p>
<p>Today, the room which housed the Legislative Assembly
chamber is now bare, as is the former committee room. No physical evidence
remains on site of the most senior law making institution and instrument of
governance that Norfolk Island has ever possessed. Every tangible object of
Norfolk’s political culture and heritage no longer belong to the Norfolk
people. </p>

People dance, people fly, people cry, make love, fight wars even, and I wanna sail and share the feeling. So I thought, why not making a sailing club for catamarans in Jelsa, on island of Hvar, Croatia. I started to sail with Hobie cat 17, and even though it's a small boat (5 meters long, 2,5 meters wide and has a mast 9 meters high), but it's an extremely fast boat (up to 40 km/h). But the most important of it all, it has nothing but sails. 

As I love the sea, the island of Hvar and sailing, I've decided to form a sailing club where people will be able to share the sailing experience and learn how to sail with those kind of boats. The sailing club will also encourage and hold lectures, ateliers and presentation from diverse, but compatible areas: culture, education, sport, sustainable development, multimedia and wellness.

It's base camp will be placed in our family vineyard, which is right on the shore of the sea. There I've planted Mediterranean plants (olives, lavender and so on) and arranged all the field to be people friendly.

So now I'm stepping forward in search for people that share a passion for creating good and positive stuff. Before my head explodes from ideas and desire to create meaningful things worth living for, I 'm asking you, to help me make this project come true. Contribute to our project and be a  part of better tomorrow. By doing that, you will help to make yet one more positive place on the planet whose doors will be opened for all of you.
All the contributors will be awarded with gifts: our products (olive oil, wine, lavender oil etc.), t-shirts with Ka Boom logo, possibility to sail with us, Ka Boom postcards handwritten by me and my eight year old nephew (he doesn't know that yet, but he will :), guided tours on the island, seven days stay in Jelsa and so on.


OUR PERKS AS YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT!

Invest in our project and let us send our perks as your birthday present, or even a Christmas, New years present!, to someone you care about! Just provide us with the address, and we'll make sure she/he receives back all the love you gave us with your help. :)


After rain, there will be Sun and than we sail! :)

Who are islanders and why should we sail?





Following is a detailed description of the project:



Who am I?


I've been living with passion ever sense I was born. When I loved, I loved truly, when I was hurt, I cried sincerely, and when I go, I'll know I gave everything I had in my heart to life itself.

I am a thirty three years old professor of social sciences (sociology, philosophy, politics, ethics, economy and logic) and I used to work in bilingual school in Zagreb, Croatia. I was teaching mentioned subjects on French, English and Croatian. Besides that, I worked as a librarian, tourist guide, skipper, waiter, journalist, and even as an actor/director. Bunch of stuff, all in all. And, I am proud to say that where ever I went or worked, people where happy and willing to share their time with me. I love people and  believe we must search everywhere for a way to make them smile, because their smile will be our own fulfillment. 
I was born in Banja Luka (Bosnia and Herzegovina), but I've spent most of my life in Croatia. My mother is from Bosnia (Banja Luka) and my father is from Croatia (Jelsa, island of Hvar). Therefor I am a mix of Bosnian heart (for those who don't know; Bosnian heart is full of laughter and love) and islands persistence and will. As everybody, I also have my flaws, but I try to correct them daily.

During my lifetime, I've finished university (master of science), learned to speak three languages fluently (unfortunately I haven't been using German for years, and I'm kind of rusty, but it will come back), lived in only three states (Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and France), worked all over the place, managed to earn enough money to make a movie, that I believed in (it was shown on a few film festivals), had an exhibition of sculptures (that I make, when I have some free time), recently learned to play guitar, and went into sports (triathlon and sailing).


I am sincerely driven by will to create and to fully live and experience  life, and that is what I have to offer to the world.



What am I aiming at?

Ever sense I was a little boy I used to go to work in our fields with my brothers and our father. My brothers and I, we were the rarest ones, of young people, who still worked in the filed, thank to my fathers scary look. Even though I hated it when I was fourteen, as anybody would at that time, now I am proud of my heritage. 

Today, as I love sailing and immense beauties of island of Hvar, I want to develop a sailing club in Jelsa, island of Hvar. A club that will offer both: experience of sailing with catamarans and the experience of island of Hvar.  The club itself will hold various lectures, events, presentations, practical experience of sailing with Hobie cat, but also gather people who want to learn and share.








What will you be helping to create?

From social point of view - you will help to create a place where people come to share and learn. A place that will provide a start point for those who want to share with others, and present themselves to others, through lectures, presentations, exhibitions etc. A place where languages and  cultures will be exchanged.
From business point of view - you will be investing in the club that will employ people: sailing instructors, tourist guides, linguists, participants of further different projects etc.
From development point of view - multi-hull (catamaran) sailing is rather unknown in Croatia, and you will be making it more accessible in here. And also you will be investing in development of rural region.
From human point of view - once, you will come, you will see what you helped to create, and we will sit down, I'll poor you a glass of wine, I'll thank you from the bottom of my heart and we'll enjoy the day. 






What have I done regarding the project until today?

I had approximately 5000€ saved and through one year: 


I bought a boat (Hobie cat 17) and brought it to Jelsa from Slovenia.
I've learned to sail with it.

In our field/vineyard, that will eventually become a sailing base camp: I've fixed most of the stone walls. That makes around 100 meters of stone walls, high between one and two meters, and wide around half of meter. I've shoveled all the terraces and planted new plants (in Dalmatia, on the islands, we have terraces in the fields. As the ground is not flat, people created years before terraces.)

I've made a sewer system (which will be later on connected to the base hut, a small structure, which will be used for lectures, presentation,  safekeeping the equipment and so on.)
I've planted olive trees, grapes, lavender, and other Mediterranean plants.
I've officially started and registered an association called Ka Boom with an aim of promotion and development of culture, sustainable development, physical activity and healthy living  (Klub alternative Boom, meaning Club of alternative Boom; boom is a part of the boat. Starting an association is rather complicated in Croatia, it took me over a month time; which is actually great. Making a sewer system was way easy comparing to administration :)

I've a applied for Erasmus+ in Sports, and even though I missed the deadline (as it took a long time to get all the documents from administration), I've established communication with different organisations all around Europe wiling to participate in events yet to come.
As the land, where our sailing base will be placed, was never officially divided between owners (grandma and her relatives), it took me a year to get all the documents in order. But now it's done. (That means I've payed a lawyer and the court.)

All of it, with 5000€ and lots of muscle work.

(the picture was taken right after all the works, so it will take time for the plants to grow)




   What We Need & What You Get
 We need:


financial aide
people that can afford themselves to come and give me a hand with work in the field
people that can help me with making an internet presentation
people that want to create

All the investments will be spent to accomplish the following:


bringing the water supply line to the field (currently we are 100 meters away from a water supply line),
establishing electricity supply system with usage of solar system,
finish the work in the filed/ex-vineyard (meaning: finishing the stone walls - there is 30 meters left. Connecting a sewer system to the base. Making the field accessible to people.),
making a hut where all the equipment will be held and where people will be able to participate in club activities (not a house, but a Thai shack),
opening a sailing club,
making a refrigerator that works using wind (I found the instructions how to make it, on the pages of university in Canada. Some awesome young people patented it.)
making an internet platform,
of course, for sending different gifts and gratitude expressions to all the investors
and hopefully, if possible, buying an additional catamaran. 

What can we do for you:


we will ship all our products mentioned in the perks (of course, depending if we can ship food to your country: it depends of export-import law) and provide you with all other services pointed out in the perks


and when everything is done, you all will be invited for the grand opening (food, music, sailing and laughter. If you can't come, we'll have to do it again, no other way :))



Where the funds go if we don't reach our entire goal:



I will reach the goal, no matter what. I came until here using my hands, will and my time. The sum of money that I'm asking for is really nothing compared to where I'm going and if the money is the only reason to give up, than there is no reason at all.

    The Impact
 There are diverse positive influences of your investment:  
for parents: You have kids and you wish them the best. They are often on social networks and nothing seems much important to them. One of the ideas that will follow Ka Boom is employment or volunteering internship for young people, where they will be thought and obligated, while working, to use different languages, to respect the nature and others, and gain confidence in themselves, by managing a sail boat and learning new skills.


for a business-man or a business-woman: we will create a possibilities of a team building adventures. Dependence on each other is the most explicit on the sea. And after it, confidence and joy is what it stays for all time.

for local society and enterprises: revitalization of islands in Croatia.
for economy in general: creating a product that brings added value to the table.
for NGO-s: possibility to participate in our events as a partners and to use our spaces (or aide) for their own presentations.
for an average person: you helped to create a small business, and when in need, you'll receive all the aide, within our power, from us. 



   
Risks & Challenges
 

The biggest challenge is following your own dream. I have let go of everything and now for a year and half I'm constantly working on development of this project.

My tactics is rather simple: keep on going with opened heart, strong will and never stop trying. Work and be persistent. The only thing I can loose is myself, by letting go of a dream.


Challenges:

development of a creative businesses in a small rural area and cooperation with others

obtaining all the needed documents from government to be eligible for businesses 
have the strength and courage to enter in a new area of expertise 
learning how to communicate with different organisations and enterprises
connecting with others with the intention to create events and finding people willing to participate

finding a market


    Other Ways You Can Help
 
send the word out
send me an e-mail with your thoughts about my idea. When one is walking by himself, sometimes a worm word can mean all the world.
maybe you can come and volunteer, we'll work on the filed, we'll go out sailing, we'll make better tomorrow. 
  Thank you for your time, for it's the most valuable thing we have.",8.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>My name is Jane Copeland and I am a chef/entrepeneur opening Lift Breakfast Bakery Ltd in Lower Lonsdale, North Vancouver very soon!</h3>

<p>Lift will not only showcases the finest food I can possibly make, it will also embody my love affair with the concept of a neighbourhood corner (fittingly accurate!) bakery.  I want to build a place where people always feel at home whether they are rushing through for a loaf of bread, coming for a special treat, or relaxing over weekend brunch.  </p>
<p>The design process has been more challenging and drawn-out that anticipated largely due to the building's heritage status.  These delays in opening have compounded extra expenses on top of this project.  But I am not about to let this stop me because I believe that Lift is meant to be at 101 Lonsdale and if you do too, unite and help BRING LIFT TO LIFE!</p>
<p>Here is what I propose because I would never ask for help without feeding you in return!</p>
<p>Contribute to BRING LIFT TO LIFE and rest assured that your hard-earned money will translate into delicious baking, eggs bennies, or even a private dining experience down the road (see perks).</p>

<p></p>
<p>My name is Lydia Cowles and I’m the owner of Twenty-Seventh Heaven, LLC a scratch bake shop I am trying to open on the South Hill of Spokane. I am a Navy Veteran, a certified Pastry Chef, and I love baking. There is a problem. Currently if you want to get heavenly coffee cake, fresh bread, or cupcakes  in Spokane you would have to make multiple stops to get all of the items on your list. Especially if you want your baked goods made from scratch and with as many local ingredients as possible. My bake shop will offer heavenly coffee cake that will be the best in Spokane. I will also be the one stop shop for all your baked good needs. No need to drive all over town to get all the things on your list! </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>At Twenty-Seventh Heaven I already have my LLC certificate. I will specialize in heavenly coffee cake, fresh breads, and cupcakes, all baked from scratch using the most local ingredients I can get my hands on. You can choose any of these delicious items and sit down to have a cup of coffee to enjoy with your treats if you’ve got a few minutes. My shop will have a modern-retro feel as soon as you step through my door. A hand painted, vintage-inspired “open/closed” sign on the front door, simple kraft boxes tied with baker’s twine to take your order to go, and antique appetizer plates with matching cups if you’re going to enjoy your treats while you are there.</p>
<p>I graduated from Whitworth College in 2005, worked retail for about 5 years, then decided to join the Navy as an officer. As my time in active duty was nearing its end I started thinking about what I wanted to do when I got out. So I tinkered with baking scratch vanilla cupcakes. The flavor difference between them and what you get from the store or a box was incredible! They were amazing! Ever since, I’ve been hooked. I love seeing how much others enjoy what I have made and getting to incorporate my creative side as well. </p>

<p>I went to Spokane Community College to get my baking certification and finished that this past winter. As I’ve gone through the Integrated Business and Entrepreneurship program and getting into the nitty-gritty of owning my own business, I’ve come to realize I can’t do it alone. So I plan to have one employee working for me to start and we’ll go from there. I found some very influential mentors going through the baking program. Both Harry and Katie have vast experience, though very different, in the baking industry. I know I can always go to them for advice and tips when I need them.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>I need approximately $30,000 to get all of my initial equipment and supplies to get my bake shop open. Getting more than that would help out with lease payments and other financial obligations I will have.</p>
<p>Anyone who contributes to my campaign will receive a handwritten Thank You note and a custom Twenty-Seventh Heaven sticker for your car. The sticker will only be given to people who donate to my campaign so you will be part of a very special group! For those who contribute $20-$45 will receive a free cupcake, your choice of flavors. Those who contribute $50-$75 will receive one dozen cupcakes of your choice. Those who contribute $100-$500 will receive 1 full year of Friends &amp; Family Discount (10% off) to enjoy baked goods. Those who contribute $500-$1,000 will receive TWO years of Friends &amp; Family Discount, one whole Coffee Cake, and your name will be added to a plaque that will hang on the wall of my shop for you to be publicly and permanently thanked for your contribution. For those fantastic people who are able to contribute $1,001 or more to my campaign, they will receive a LIFETIME Friends &amp; Family Discount, two whole Coffee Cakes, free Coffee on each visit to my shop, and your name will be added to a plaque that will hang on the wall of my shop to publicly and permanently thank you for your extremely generous contribution to my business.</p>

</div></div>","Why do you drink craft beer?     We believe in making hand crafted beers that are un-intimidating, true to the styles that generations of brewers before us created, and can be enjoyed by all varieties of beer drinkers from the newest craft drinker to the enthusiast.  We want to brew using true and tested ingredients while still adding just a bit of our own styling. Further, we want to use the money that we make while creating this great beer to aid charities in need of support.  So, you get great beer and you help great causes, its like winning twice!   How can you help and what's in it for you? Opening a brewery, of any size, is expensive. There are multiple licenses, an exhaustive list of equipment and myriad other expenses for which we need capital.  We know that we are asking you to trust us with your hard earned cash, and you can rest assured that we are in this to make something happen.  We know how to make great beer, but we need your help getting some initial capital. You get to help us with our dream, and you get some really sweet swag (rewards) for contributing.

I'm a native New Yorker, first generation born Puerto Rican in my family. I have 4 wonderful kids and a sweet but spoiled granddaughter LOL. The mother of my children and I are dear friends, a relationship for which I am always grateful. I've led a diverse career. I started as a Classical musician, freelancing in NYC for over 30 years as a Bassoonist. In 1997 I changed careers and became a Technologist within the financial sector. I was very fortunate to have great mentors and teachers, so I excelled in my career. In 2007 I moved to the Public Safety business and have been doing that for the past 9 years. Now I have chosen to work for my myself in a line of business that I am very passionate about; the Cigar business.</p><div>I've been smoking Cigars for over 24 years. You may ask yourself, what makes a person smoke cigars? What draws them to what some may refer to as a smelly habit? Well, I can only speak from my experiences as a human being who chooses to smoke cigars.</div><div>
<br/>Like fine wine, fine coffee, fine spirits, there is a discernment about Cigar smoking that awakens my taste buds. Explosions of cocoa, starchy flavors, toasted almonds, coffee, filling my mouth and nostrils with those wonderful organic aromas.</div><div>
<br/>Cigar smoking has also granted me opportunities to meet and converse with some of the most wonderful human beings I have ever met. Strong fellowships were built that have lasted for decades. </div><div>
<br/>Now to let you know what my goal is:<br/>There are many people who I have met and who I have developed long relationships with and they consistently ask me, what do I look for in a cigar?

</div><div></div></div>","Hi and welcome to my campaign! My name is Eddie Cabrera. I'm a native New Yorker, first generation born Puerto Rican in my family. I have 4 wonderful kids and a sweet but spoiled granddaughter LOL. The mother of my children and I are dear friends, a relationship for which I am always grateful. I've led a diverse career. I started as a Classical musician, freelancing in NYC for over 30 years as a Bassoonist. In 1997 I changed careers and became a Technologist within the financial sector. I was very fortunate to have great mentors and teachers, so I excelled in my career. In 2007 I moved to the Public Safety business and have been doing that for the past 9 years. Now I have chosen to work for my myself in a line of business that I am very passionate about; the Cigar business.I've been smoking Cigars for over 24 years. You may ask yourself, what makes a person smoke cigars? What draws them to what some may refer to as a smelly habit? Well, I can only speak from my experiences as a human being who chooses to smoke cigars.
Like fine wine, fine coffee, fine spirits, there is a discernment about Cigar smoking that awakens my taste buds. Explosions of cocoa, starchy flavors, toasted almonds, coffee, filling my mouth and nostrils with those wonderful organic aromas.
Cigar smoking has also granted me opportunities to meet and converse with some of the most wonderful human beings I have ever met. Strong fellowships were built that have lasted for decades. 
Now to let you know what my goal is:There are many people who I have met and who I have developed long relationships with and they consistently ask me, what do I look for in a cigar? How do I develop my taste buds for different cigar makers and regions? How do I buy Cigar-related gifts for my loved one?
As a result of these conversations, I decided that I would incorporate products and gift packs that help address these very questions, building the Cigar community, and helping them to slowly develop their knowledge about the Cigar world.
So here we are!! I'll leave you with this sentiment: Cigar smoking is more than just a hobby. When I smoke, I participate with a Cigar community, I think deep thoughts, I laugh, I cry, I welcome the future, while I say goodbye to the past. Come experience this with me!   What We Need & What You Get Currently I have raised 30k, but need an additional 15k to cover startup costs for technology automation, engineering designs, A&E work and permits.If I am unable to meet my goal, whatever amount I do collect, I will add to my start up fund and continue to work on this possibility. I am committed to be successful.
My success will be primarily driven by my self commitment. My passion will be the secondary driver. On top of these two powerful forces, I have my practical experience, which include the following skills:Financial ManagementRisk AssessmentCustomer ServiceTransparency
These, in conjunction with what I indicated earlier, will help create the possibility of great success. As a result of these skills, we already have the retail space negotiated and we start construction in mid-September of 2016. Come join us!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My family has farmed here for over four hundred years and over that time, we have faced a lot of change. When I came back from University I looked at one of the disused farm buildings and I thought, what potential, and decided it would be perfect for a distillery. With crowdfunding, we will be able to buy equipment for the distillery and bring you a new and exciting gin!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466170685/Badvo_Announcement_ygmjni.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why here?</b></p>
<p>Badvo is situated in Pitlochry, with two (soon to be three) other distilleries. With the edition of Badvo, the public will be able to visit Pitlochry to look at a cross-section of distilleries, ranging from the traditional to the commercial, to the modern and micro. Pitlochry will soon be a hub for those wishing to learn more about the spirits industry and get a really hands on and personal experience.</p>

</div><div>
<ul> </ul>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>What will the crowdfunding do?</b></div>
<div>The £50,000 crowdfunding will be spent on two copper pot stills, bottling equipment, and set-up costs. If you would like to contribute you'll be open to all sorts of perks, starting at a £50 local package for an investor's edition bottle of Badvo and a trip for coffee with us at the distillery.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>What makes us unique?</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The distillery will function as diversification within our working hill farm.</li>
<li>Distilling Badvo will be done by our mother-daughter dream team.</li>
<li>We will be foraging for our botanicals from the farm so our gin will be a reflection of the land that surrounds us.</li>
<li>We are a very hands-on team and we do as much as we can ourselves, including branding, publicity, and bottling.</li>

My family has farmed here for over four hundred years and over that time, we have faced a lot of change. When I came back from University I looked at one of the disused farm buildings and I thought, what potential, and decided it would be perfect for a distillery. With crowdfunding, we will be able to buy equipment for the distillery and bring you a new and exciting gin!



Why here?
Badvo is situated in Pitlochry, with two (soon to be three) other distilleries. With the edition of Badvo, the public will be able to visit Pitlochry to look at a cross-section of distilleries, ranging from the traditional to the commercial, to the modern and micro. Pitlochry will soon be a hub for those wishing to learn more about the spirits industry and get a really hands on and personal experience.


 

What will the crowdfunding do?
The £50,000 crowdfunding will be spent on two copper pot stills, bottling equipment, and set-up costs. If you would like to contribute you'll be open to all sorts of perks, starting at a £50 local package for an investor's edition bottle of Badvo and a trip for coffee with us at the distillery.

What makes us unique?


The distillery will function as diversification within our working hill farm.
Distilling Badvo will be done by our mother-daughter dream team.
We will be foraging for our botanicals from the farm so our gin will be a reflection of the land that surrounds us.
We are a very hands-on team and we do as much as we can ourselves, including branding, publicity, and bottling.




 
What's in the future?
In the following years, we have plans for expanding into the remaining farm buildings to create a tasting and coffee bar. The dream is that you'll be able to relax at the bar with a Badvo watching the distillation.If you would like to help us out please share our page and if you have any questions please feel free to get in touch!NB.

And the place had suffered a horrible reputation, due to the inadequate and neglectful management, cutting corners with the menu, and unprofessional mistreatment of customers.

</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Welcome to Sobremesa, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 18px;line-height: 24px;background-color: initial;"">this ""untranslatable"" concept which basically means: </span>
</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>The ""space"" that a meal creates to allow the magic of the relationship experience between individuals</b></i></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">_____________________________</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">It's all about the FOOD !</h3> <p>Why does food have to be so complicated ???  And why so expensive???</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be, actually.  Food was never complicated -- somehow, we have made it complicated...........and expensive.</p>
<p>Food is basic. </p>
<p>Food should be fresh. </p>
<p>Food should be what is available at the time.</p>
<p>Food should look, feel and taste crispy and lovely.</p>
<p>Food should be green.</p>
<p>Food should have texture.</p>
<p>Food should transcend cultures.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">_____________________________</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">It's all about the FLAVOR !</h3>Spices, sauces, marinades, time (lots of time), infusions, mixtures, adobo (my favorite) and a lot of love. Combine this with the freshest of ingredients (which means whatever is available at the time, not what is cool at the time). </div><div>That is how you do it. </div><div>People need to eat 3 times a day, and they need to eat every day. And they need to stay healthy, and they need to save money. </div><div><br/></div><div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><i style=""background-color: initial;""><b>I am on a mission to change the way people eat when they eat out. </b></i></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><i style=""background-color: initial;""><b><br/></b></i></div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Hello, I'm Chef Giovanna Huyke.   A huge welcome to those who know me, and those who are about to. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, but I am a woman of the world. I have been cooking for 30+ years.  I love to cook and to enjoy a good conversation, especially at meal time. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>All my life I have been surrounded by great aroma and flavors from my mother’s kitchen... my parents had such zest for life!  It taught me to enjoy and savor life one delicious bite at a time.  I followed that creed and here I am.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>I am on a mission to feed people better.  Better food.  Better flavors.  More diversity of dishes.  Better freshness.  Better health.  Better fresh.</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""text-align: left;background-color: initial;"">Cooking is my passion, my heart, my life.  For sure I am no spring chicken, but I am a tough woman and I am determined to share my love for food and make an impact on life with anybody who enters my home (opps, I mean my restaurant), I want to start a conversation and food is my best language. </span><br/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">It SHOULD NOT BE all about the PRICE !</h3>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">And it's </span><i>not going to be more expensive</i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">.  In fact, it's going to be more affordable than anything comparable.</span></span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Eating well was never something that cost a lot of money.  Eating well was never something that should be exclusive.  Eating well is something that should be basic, and should be part of the fabric of how we live day-to-day.  Eating Well equals being healthy, mentally, physically, and spiritually.<br/></span></div>

<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHY should you care ?</h3>
<p>My adviser calls me Gio 2.0 because I really am truly trying to revolutionize how we eat, what we eat, how we stay healthy and what we paid for it.</p>
<p>And it has only taken me over 30 years of cooking, traveling, learning, building a family, getting a divorce and falling pretty hard, humbling myself to a new generation of young creative chefs.  <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>I was so lucky to have been part of the transformation of Puerto Rican cuisine, blending the use of local ingredients with traditional cooking methods.  I was trained in a classic traditional kitchen but I was born with the sofrito in my nose (Sofrito is a savory mixture of onions garlic peppers and cilantro and the mainstay on every dish in our Island).</p>
<p>I have an adventurous hand and a traveling mind.  I took my Island cuisine to Spain, Japan, Costa Rica, Colombia, Greece and Hawaii.  Every place gave me a new frame of flavors. </p>
<p>I spent my 20's in New Orleans where in Lee Barnes Cooking school and my first boss Paul Prudhomme taught me discipline and organization.  I lost my fear in New York with Felipe Rojas Lombardi where I learned to use my roots in everything I cooked.</p>
<p>I found my mentors in Puerto Rico:  Augusto Schreiner taught me strength and dedication.  And Alfredo Ayala  unlocked my taste buds and taught me  freedom of spirit when you cook.</p>
<p>But it was my Mother who made sense of everything I learned.  It is Mom who I still call on to discuss  menus and recipes </p>
<p>I am here to ask you to be part of a wonderful opportunity that I have to share my concept of food, life and love with you.</p>

</h3>
<p>We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.<br/></p>
<p>We are taking over an existing restaurant space, with a immaculate equipment and fully furnished otherwise.  This includes all operational and liquor licences.</p>
<p>I am calling my new restaurant Sobremesa.  Which means the content conversation after a great meal.  We want to cook your great meal!</p>
<p>I need to raise  $350,000.  100% of the funds will be used </p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">to purchase initial food inventory; </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">to purchase the kitchen and dining equipment; </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">to fund the liquor and operating licenses; </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">to fund Initial rent payments; and</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">to fund all other initial working capital needs.</span><br/>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The space is located in a vibrant, thriving, walking area of downtown Washington, DC.  I am so lucky that the existing owner has run an exceptional operation... another woman chef-owner for more than 10 years.</span><br/></p>
<p>The space is small enough to represent my heart and the soul of the food: warm, energetic and cozy.</p>
<p>It is a place one can relax, meet friends, laugh, tell stories, console a friend, unwind with a drink, have coffee, and enjoy an aperitif-- just feel at home. </p>
<p>This is a chef-oriented restaurant....A kitchen with no geographical boundary, where the menu is written the day the ingredients arrive.  We will use what is fresh, local and available  We will recreate flavors that come from tradition and a little of old-world vision, but in a new-world way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I will  serve what I  love to cook, I want different cuisines mingling  on the plate frequently and promiscuously; delicious food with local ingredients from a whimsical kitchen.</p>
<p>We will emphasize and predominantly serve only what we make so in house breads, sausages, pastas, hot sauces, flavored oils and spiced liquors marmalade and candies.</p>
<p> We will have a small menu with limited number of appetizers, main courses and desserts. Menu will always be changing based on availability, freshness and seasonal produce, and a need to try new ideas.</p>
<p>Our priority will be good service.  It will be fast, personal and knowledgeable, not stuffy. Diners will be the priority, where you feel you can always speak directly with the kitchen because we will cater to you.</p>
<p>We will have a complete bar with a variety of drinks but with a simple variety of the most important liquors and with a focus on speed and simplicity. We will make our own various selection of hand crafted specialties (but they will not cost any more--no paying an arm an a leg just because it is a new mixture)</p>
<p>A small but carefully picked selection of wines with chef recommendations for the dishes on the menu. Will always have a feature wine for those adventurers to try. Wine to us is a normal part of each meal we will price wines accordingly.</p>
<p>I have an incredible team!</p>
<p>I will oversee a team of hand-selected staff, experienced operational professionals in the kitchen, bar and wait staff areas, many of whom have worked with me  in the past. <b><i>The intent is to maintain a small, but busy and positive staff. </i></b> We intend to target very low turnover, preferring to have a few dedicated and busy workers, rather than a larger staff which suffers from frequent turnover. </p>
<p>The décor will be warm and simple so the food, the wine and the meal are main focus. The wonderful smells from the kitchen and warm homemade bread will permeate the environment.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Restaurant - Overall Concept</h3>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;""><i>Our essential
task is to make great tasting food with great service and interesting menus</i></b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. Establish a strong identity with
our food and service. Develop a sense of community with our patrons. Our
communication and programs will be directed towards the persons who love and
enjoy a flavorful, interesting, fun and tasty food. We will feature different
tastings and theme menus, invited chefs to always keep the conversation going.
Word of mouth, email bank and social media will spread the word out and build
our customer base.</span><br/></p>
<p><b><i>Our pricing
strategy is intended to be competitively lower than the average DC area, and
lower than the price/quality equitation to which DC eaters have become
accustomed.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Our Goal</i></b> is to be full, 100% of the time,
not partially full, part of the time and charge higher prices for such lack of
volume. </p>
<p>I believe that the
entire experience of eating, drinking and being with friends or colleagues is
enhanced when there is community. Sobremesa is not intended to “break the bank”
of eaters once, but rather to fairly fill the restaurant regularly, and with
regulars.</p>
<p><b><i>Guest
appearances of various food, wine and culinary hand-made food product makers
will be a regular mainstay. </i></b> I intend s to involve my culinary
friends, other chefs of all cultures, to experiment and share their culinary
intellectual capital with diners. </p>
<p><b>This is where not being a spring chicken is a great
thing.  I have had the opportunity to
meet some of the masters of food, as well as work with some of the incredible
new emerging talent, and I intend to give them both a showcase to create the
collective environment of celebration I intend to build.</b></p>
<p>Washington DC's stature as the center of the political, diplomatic and non-governmental activity creates a constant renewal of people, ideas, and excitement<span style=""background-color: initial;"">. Many are looking for a regular place to dine, and the targeted
restaurant’s location is located squarely in the middle of one of DC’s most
vibrant, high-density neighborhoods. </span></p>
<p><b>The whimsical
chef-oriented and market-based cuisine, unique concept and attractive price
point will differentiate us from the many, existing “upscale modern”
restaurants in the DC area. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We prepared some
interesting packages for your participation.  Come and be part
of Sobremesa and lets keep the conversation going.</p>

Welcome to Sobremesa, this ""untranslatable"" concept which basically means: 

The ""space"" that a meal creates to allow the magic of the relationship experience between individuals
_____________________________
It's all about the FOOD ! Why does food have to be so complicated ???  And why so expensive???
It doesn't have to be, actually.  Food was never complicated -- somehow, we have made it complicated...........and expensive.
Food is basic. 
Food should be fresh. 
Food should be what is available at the time.
Food should look, feel and taste crispy and lovely.
Food should be green.
Food should have texture.
Food should transcend cultures.


_____________________________
It's all about the FLAVOR !Spices, sauces, marinades, time (lots of time), infusions, mixtures, adobo (my favorite) and a lot of love. Combine this with the freshest of ingredients (which means whatever is available at the time, not what is cool at the time). That is how you do it. People need to eat 3 times a day, and they need to eat every day. And they need to stay healthy, and they need to save money. 
I am on a mission to change the way people eat when they eat out. 

Hello, I'm Chef Giovanna Huyke.   A huge welcome to those who know me, and those who are about to. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, but I am a woman of the world. I have been cooking for 30+ years.  I love to cook and to enjoy a good conversation, especially at meal time. 

All my life I have been surrounded by great aroma and flavors from my mother’s kitchen... my parents had such zest for life!  It taught me to enjoy and savor life one delicious bite at a time.  I followed that creed and here I am.
I am on a mission to feed people better.  Better food.  Better flavors.  More diversity of dishes.  Better freshness.  Better health.  Better fresh.
Cooking is my passion, my heart, my life.  For sure I am no spring chicken, but I am a tough woman and I am determined to share my love for food and make an impact on life with anybody who enters my home (opps, I mean my restaurant), I want to start a conversation and food is my best language. 



____________________________

It SHOULD NOT BE all about the PRICE !

And it's not going to be more expensive.  In fact, it's going to be more affordable than anything comparable.

Eating well was never something that cost a lot of money.  Eating well was never something that should be exclusive.  Eating well is something that should be basic, and should be part of the fabric of how we live day-to-day.  Eating Well equals being healthy, mentally, physically, and spiritually.

____________________________



WHY should you care ?
My adviser calls me Gio 2.0 because I really am truly trying to revolutionize how we eat, what we eat, how we stay healthy and what we paid for it.
And it has only taken me over 30 years of cooking, traveling, learning, building a family, getting a divorce and falling pretty hard, humbling myself to a new generation of young creative chefs.  

I was so lucky to have been part of the transformation of Puerto Rican cuisine, blending the use of local ingredients with traditional cooking methods.  I was trained in a classic traditional kitchen but I was born with the sofrito in my nose (Sofrito is a savory mixture of onions garlic peppers and cilantro and the mainstay on every dish in our Island).
I have an adventurous hand and a traveling mind.  I took my Island cuisine to Spain, Japan, Costa Rica, Colombia, Greece and Hawaii.  Every place gave me a new frame of flavors. 
I spent my 20's in New Orleans where in Lee Barnes Cooking school and my first boss Paul Prudhomme taught me discipline and organization.  I lost my fear in New York with Felipe Rojas Lombardi where I learned to use my roots in everything I cooked.
I found my mentors in Puerto Rico:  Augusto Schreiner taught me strength and dedication.  And Alfredo Ayala  unlocked my taste buds and taught me  freedom of spirit when you cook.
But it was my Mother who made sense of everything I learned.  It is Mom who I still call on to discuss  menus and recipes 
I am here to ask you to be part of a wonderful opportunity that I have to share my concept of food, life and love with you.
____________________________

The Restaurant - Specifics 

We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
We are taking over an existing restaurant space, with a immaculate equipment and fully furnished otherwise.  This includes all operational and liquor licences.
I am calling my new restaurant Sobremesa.  Which means the content conversation after a great meal.  We want to cook your great meal!
I need to raise  $350,000.  100% of the funds will be used 


to purchase initial food inventory; 
to purchase the kitchen and dining equipment; 
to fund the liquor and operating licenses; 
to fund Initial rent payments; and

to fund all other initial working capital needs.


The space is located in a vibrant, thriving, walking area of downtown Washington, DC.  I am so lucky that the existing owner has run an exceptional operation... another woman chef-owner for more than 10 years.
The space is small enough to represent my heart and the soul of the food: warm, energetic and cozy.
It is a place one can relax, meet friends, laugh, tell stories, console a friend, unwind with a drink, have coffee, and enjoy an aperitif-- just feel at home. 
This is a chef-oriented restaurant....A kitchen with no geographical boundary, where the menu is written the day the ingredients arrive.  We will use what is fresh, local and available  We will recreate flavors that come from tradition and a little of old-world vision, but in a new-world way.

I will  serve what I  love to cook, I want different cuisines mingling  on the plate frequently and promiscuously; delicious food with local ingredients from a whimsical kitchen.
We will emphasize and predominantly serve only what we make so in house breads, sausages, pastas, hot sauces, flavored oils and spiced liquors marmalade and candies.
 We will have a small menu with limited number of appetizers, main courses and desserts. Menu will always be changing based on availability, freshness and seasonal produce, and a need to try new ideas.
Our priority will be good service.  It will be fast, personal and knowledgeable, not stuffy. Diners will be the priority, where you feel you can always speak directly with the kitchen because we will cater to you.
We will have a complete bar with a variety of drinks but with a simple variety of the most important liquors and with a focus on speed and simplicity. We will make our own various selection of hand crafted specialties (but they will not cost any more--no paying an arm an a leg just because it is a new mixture)
A small but carefully picked selection of wines with chef recommendations for the dishes on the menu. Will always have a feature wine for those adventurers to try. Wine to us is a normal part of each meal we will price wines accordingly.
I have an incredible team!
I will oversee a team of hand-selected staff, experienced operational professionals in the kitchen, bar and wait staff areas, many of whom have worked with me  in the past. The intent is to maintain a small, but busy and positive staff.  We intend to target very low turnover, preferring to have a few dedicated and busy workers, rather than a larger staff which suffers from frequent turnover. 
The décor will be warm and simple so the food, the wine and the meal are main focus. The wonderful smells from the kitchen and warm homemade bread will permeate the environment.


_____________________________


The Restaurant - Overall Concept
Our essential
task is to make great tasting food with great service and interesting menus. Establish a strong identity with
our food and service. Develop a sense of community with our patrons. Our
communication and programs will be directed towards the persons who love and
enjoy a flavorful, interesting, fun and tasty food. We will feature different
tastings and theme menus, invited chefs to always keep the conversation going.
Word of mouth, email bank and social media will spread the word out and build
our customer base.
Our pricing
strategy is intended to be competitively lower than the average DC area, and
lower than the price/quality equitation to which DC eaters have become
accustomed.
Our Goal is to be full, 100% of the time,
not partially full, part of the time and charge higher prices for such lack of
volume. 
I believe that the
entire experience of eating, drinking and being with friends or colleagues is
enhanced when there is community. Sobremesa is not intended to “break the bank”
of eaters once, but rather to fairly fill the restaurant regularly, and with
regulars.
Guest
appearances of various food, wine and culinary hand-made food product makers
will be a regular mainstay.  I intend s to involve my culinary
friends, other chefs of all cultures, to experiment and share their culinary
intellectual capital with diners. 
This is where not being a spring chicken is a great
thing.  I have had the opportunity to
meet some of the masters of food, as well as work with some of the incredible
new emerging talent, and I intend to give them both a showcase to create the
collective environment of celebration I intend to build.
Washington DC's stature as the center of the political, diplomatic and non-governmental activity creates a constant renewal of people, ideas, and excitement. Many are looking for a regular place to dine, and the targeted
restaurant’s location is located squarely in the middle of one of DC’s most
vibrant, high-density neighborhoods. 
The whimsical
chef-oriented and market-based cuisine, unique concept and attractive price
point will differentiate us from the many, existing “upscale modern”
restaurants in the DC area. 

We prepared some
interesting packages for your participation.  Come and be part
of Sobremesa and lets keep the conversation going.

So I refined the stew, and developed other marinades and mixes over the years that have proven to be all-time winners - with my family, friends and pot-luck gathering guests. </p>
<p>Gourmet Stew for Grains - Ancient grains are good for you but, they do not always taste good enough to tempt you on their own. Enter the Purely Good Foods Gourmet Stew for Grains. While it has its roots in Nigerian cuisine, this locally sourced, tomato based, long simmered sauce is so versatile, it can be used over vegetables, soups, meats, fish and poultry. </p>
<p>Suyarific Grilling Sauce - Peanut butter based, and exploding with flavor, this sauce is perfect for use as a coating for beef (including organ meats) to be grilled without first marinating it. Provides a lot of moisture for your meat.</p>
<p>Suyarific Grilling Rub - Also peanut based, this mix is a rub that can be used the same way as the sauce. packed full of flavor, meat does not need to be marinated beforehand either.</p>
<p>Not Your Plain Fry Mix - Hold on to your horses when this mix is used for frying or baking poultry or seafood. Also bursting with flavor, a little of this mix goes a long way to flavoring your fish and poultry and bringing a fresh, delicious new taste to your table.</p>
<p>All foods described here come in Hot, Medium and Mild heats to accommodate all tastes.</p> <ul> <li>I am Adaora Ihekwaba and I have been passionate about cooking since my first child, and subsequent four children were born with pronounced picky palates for foods. This challenged me to come up with nutritious, delicious meals they would eat. </li> <li>We would love to introduce these delicious sauces and mixes to the marketplace and have people discover them. While they certainly helped and are still helping me get nutrition into my children (lol...), they are not only for picky eaters. They will bring a new richness and diversity to your eating experience. <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>
</li> </ul> <p>As passionate and excited as we are about getting these foods out to the marketplace, the process is an expensive one and, as you can imagine, our start up does not have the required funds to do it without your help.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, the bottom line is that we need to raise $10,000.00 for the following purposes:</p>

serious hand, finger and wrist injuries reported every year due to box cutters,
utility knives and blades?   It’s hard to believe that something so small
and useful can be so dangerous.
We believe the SAFETY BLADE is the
answer !!!









The original idea of the Safety Blade came from a young man that worked in an auto body shop.  After witnessing multiple injuries to his co-workers due to the unsafe storage of razor blades, he came up with an idea – he wanted to create a utility blade that could be safely stored and disposed of in the workplace.


The goal became to create the safest cutting tool on the market today.  ""NEVER TOUCH THE BLADE"" became the engineering slogan.




The result is a state of the art blade that is safe to carry, safe to use, safe to dispose of and safe for the environment.



Responsible Parenting

We owe it to our children to keep them safe.  This state of the art retractable blade is safe enough for classroom, home and office use.  Safety Blade is the ideal cutting tool for your family.




Reduce Workplace Injuries
Safe, durable and easy to use.  Safety Blade increases workplace safety and will reduce employee accidents and injuries on the job site.  Greatly reduces product damage.



Perfect for Do-It-Yourself Projects
Steel blade is stronger and lasts longer than the typical razor blade.  It is ideal for cutting wood, wallboard and molding.  Scrapes paint and stickers from glass and metal.


Recyclable and Eco-Friendly
Promote green living for your children and community.  Our product is safe for the environment, and it can be recycled as easily as a soda can without endangering others.



























Scott J. Cooper is the CEO and Creative Director of World Patent Marketing.  He is also the Director and Founder of The Cooper Idea Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing funding for special causes around the world.

<h3><strong>Who are We?</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Mauro. I am a plant-based cook. Myself, my wife, daughter &amp; dog adopted a plant-based lifestyle over 10 years ago. We are also Italian. Well, my dog is not Italian, although she thinks she is.</p>
<p>It took a trip to Italy in 2006 to discover the most incredible plant-based Italian food that I had ever seen. Foods that I thought were lost to me forever, since, let's face it when we say plant-based, Italy is not the first country that comes to mind. Wrooooong! I should have known that the country known the world over for the quality of its food would take plant-based Italian food to new culinary heights.</p>
<p>By the end of that trip I was importing these products to Canada. Years later we would open the first ever Vegan Italian Food Emporium in Toronto. All the while I continued to work on perfecting our very own handcrafted plant-based Italian foods. We have been serving these products to our catering clients for years. Now we would like to share our food with everyone who loves and appreciates great homemade authentic Italian food. </p>
<h3><strong>What do we want to do?</strong></h3>
<p>We are The Vegitaliano - Italian Street food Deli. We take the centuries old tradition of great Italian Street food and we make the most amazing fresh, made to order Italian sandwiches with freshly baked schiacciata bread and our very own handcrafted plant-based Italian inspired cutlets, meatballs, sausages, porchetta, salumi, cheeses and much more.</p>
<p>           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478183221/hmflvesods7dckw33rvc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>We want to transport you to a Salumeria/Deli in Italy. The smell of freshly baked bread and simmering tomato sauce in the air. Deli cases full of our handcrafted plant-based cheeses (handmade ricotta, bocconcini, aged asiago/parmiggiano, aged goat style, provolone), meats, salumi that we utilize in our sandwiches but, that you can also buy whole. Desserts, let's not forget desserts. Handmade Tiramisu, cannoli, bombe and more. So delicious they will leave you questioning if in fact they could actually be Dairy &amp; Egg free. </p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We are excited to share with you our amazing Italian Street food. We guarantee you will not be disappointed with our offerings. </p>
<p>We are looking to raise $30000 to help us grow our business to the retail level.  Start up costs for rent, equipment, permits etc are what we need to continue to grow.</p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Spreading the peaceful cuisine message in a positive way through great food is what we essentially do. Having a retail location will help us spread this positive message. Our goal is to create a place where everyone who loves great Italian food can experience a little slice of plant-based Italy and at the same time benefit our amazing animal brothers and sisters, our beautiful Mother Earth and our very own well being one meal at a time.  Your contribution and support will help us reach our goal.  </p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Opening a retail business is risky and a food  business is even riskier, but I have been in the plant-based food business for over 10 years now and I have the loving support of my beautiful family and a knowledge of and passion for Italian Inspired plant-based foods. I've been in business long enough to know that it takes hard work and dedication to build a successful and profitable retail outlet. Heck, it's taken years of hard work, love and passion to get us this far and we are continuing to put a lot of our own sweat, time, energy, and money into making this happen. </p>
<p>The challenge is finding the right space for our Deli. The more complete the location (ie: taking over a previous food space) the more we can do with less funds.</p>
<p>There is a risk that we will not make our goal, however. we have created perks that you can claim from our existing catering business, without having to wait for the Deli to open. </p>
<p><strong>Main Goal:</strong> $30,000.00 </p>
<p><strong>Interim goals: </strong>$20,000.00 - A refrigerated Street food trailer will help us get to vegan events all over Southern Ontario/Quebec corridor. This interim goal will make this possible.</p>

Literally, in this very vineyard off of the Silverado Trail in Calistoga. A little over 10 years ago, I signed up as a harvest intern with <a href=""https://www.cakebread.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cakebread Cellars</a>, and was put up in a trailer (not pictured) between these rows of their Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot vines.</p><p>After a year, it was time to head back to Maine and leave wine country behind. But as time passed, it became clear that one thing in particular truly had been left behind for good, as there  wasn't a single thing like it east of the Sierra Nevadas. This thing was the <strong>winery tasting room, </strong>and is something that only the tiniest fraction of Americans are able to enjoy. </p><p>There just one reason that separates this tiny group of tasting room ""haves""from the rest of us millions of have-nots, and it’s not about to change anytime soon -- <strong>geography</strong>. There are some folks that can jump in their Tesla and within minutes -- especially in Ludicrous Mode -- be enjoying the latest release of Opus One on a terrace overlooking the winery's estate vineyard, nestled between Napa's mountains and valley floor. Unfortunately, for me to get there and back for a tasting, we’re talking about at least 6,400 miles on the ‘ol Jetta...</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526768094/hvc9uxmxscmkntc5mpw0.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Now granted, these luxury experiences can be absolutely unforgettable, and it would be cool if something like them were a little more accessible.  But as special and beautiful as they are, they're not actually the most important thing that the rest of us are missing out on, because  they <i>teach us almost nothing about wine</i>. That's right -- while drinking ultra-premium wine at the site where it's made can be a life experience and take your Instagram to a whole new level, it'll do little more to make you a wine connoisseur than asking for a restaurant's most expensive bottle on a date.</p><p>No, that's not what I miss, and it's not what New England needs. When I was an intern, we'd schedule our one day off per week to include as many winery visits as time permitted. If the wineries focused on different varieties, and/or different subregions (Carneros vs. Stags Leap, for example), so much the better. At the end of those whirlwind days, we'd have tasted dozens of wines that -- if sold in bottle, and at retail -- were worth literally <i>thousands</i>.</p><p>However, the cost for the whole day never added up to more than that of a single decent bottle. We'd go to bed totally exhausted, but with all five senses still fully activated, and a head full of knowledge that far surpassed what we'd learned working in the winery the other six days that week.  Plus, we still had a few dollars in our pocket when it was all over, and hadn't suffered any consequences for dumping out the wines that we didn't care for. <i>I remain convinced to this day that this method -- trying as many wines as possible in a short period of time -- is by far the best, fastest, and least expensive way in existence to learn about wine</i>.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526763106/cwcncdpvnowf9fnw9waw.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>So Now What?</h3><p>OK, then, so if proximity to the vineyards and spectacular surroundings aren't essential to learning about wine, why are there more than 1,200 tasting rooms in Napa Valley alone, and basically zero in New England? You can't ship Sonoma itself out here, but you sure as hell can ship their wines, and we do exactly that to the tune of millions of bottles per year. So if geography isn't the problem, who's to blame for this??  Well, for starters:</p><p><strong>Global mass-production wineries</strong>. Let's pick on Veuve Cliquot for a random example. Is their yellow label Champagne twice as good as most options that cost half as much? Of course not. But their marketing department has a 200-year head start, and they sell 1.5 million cases (that's 18 million bottles!!) of the stuff every year, so a small California winery isn't going to open a tasting room or otherwise invest in building awareness in a market that is already dominated by one of these behemoths (e.g., Maine).</p><p>-<strong>Distributors</strong>. Scouring the world -- or even a small corner of the country -- for the most amazing boutique wineries is <i>extraordinarily </i>hard. These vintners bottle just the tiniest amounts of their magic potion each year, and chances are that they've sold it all by the time you find them. On the other hand, buying a truckload of something mass-produced, sending that truck directly to Hannaford or BJ's, and mustering up the energy to find a bank branch at which to cash the check...is not hard. There are notable exceptions to this this course -- Martignetti in MA and Crush in ME, for example -- but overall it's the distributors that are closest to the source, and that far prefer money to wines of incredible value and distinction. It's mostly because of them that it's so hard for you to find a decent bottle of wine. </p><p><strong>Sommeliers</strong>. It kills me to say this about my industry brethren, but as averse to scouring the world as distributors are, most somms are the opposite. The problem is that they often forget that they're scouring on someone's behalf (yours), and not for themselves. They bring back obscure wines from obscure places, which is why you're going to have an easier time finding an Estonian Hasanski Sladki than a Californian Chardonnay at many wine bars these days. They try incredibly hard, but often fail to help the average consumer that's simply trying to figure out what producers to trust and what wines they like at the stores in their hometown. </p><p><strong>Culture</strong>. The wine country on the west coast of America is one of the most magical, magnetic, and utopian places on earth. That's why most of the people that love American wine live there. And while there are obviously a good number of amazing wine professionals on the east coast, most of the career options available to them are in the ultra-traditional areas of restaurant and retail. The ones that would like to innovate have a hard time doing so because of limited inventory in the area (see how it always comes back to the distributors??) and ancient, pro-distributor regulations that choke progress. <br/> </p><h3>Time for a Change</h3><p>So there you have it. For those reasons, plus a few others, that's why there's nowhere around here -- <strong>YET</strong> -- that:</p><ul>
<li>Offers a wine retail experience that's interactive and educational</li>
<li>Features a ""producer spotlight"" -- i.e. sample a handful of one winery's lineup, the way you would in their tasting room, to get a feel for their ""house style"" across different varieties</li>
<li>Works tirelessly to bring in the best and most interesting wines in the country such that there's always something new to taste no matter how often you visit</li>
<li>Loves its customers even more than its wines, and is small enough to know each one by name and work as hard on keeping their favorites in stock as they do at finding them new discoveries.</li>
<li>Offers tasting opportunities for wineries that don't have their own tasting rooms and/or aren't open to the public.</li>
<li>Gives wine education and appreciation that you can actually use right away </li>
<li>Offers an in-depth exploration of a specific region and/or variety -- for example, discover how Pinot Noir did in the (amazing) 2015 vintage by tasting several examples of the variety from different vineyards and subregions within Sonoma</li>
<li>Lets you explore the difference from vintage to vintage by tasting a ""vertical"", or a flight of wines from the same producer, variety, and vineyard, but from consecutive years.</li>
<li>Is a food and wine experience that's new, exciting, and entertaining</li>
<li>Gives a guided tour of wine that's focused on making you comfortable and engaged. No showing off or lecturing.</li>
<li>Is always trying to perform miracles for its regular customers, and inviting them in try limited allocations of rare, special wines that might not exist anywhere else in New England. </li>
<li>Offers a quick, inexpensive, and grown-up diversion in downtown Freeport, not to mention a terrific place to pre-game when the line at Azure is out the door.</li>
<li>Is an experiential retail concept, but founded and operated by a career management consultant that would absolutely love to host a team-building tasting event for your group that blends the fun of wine tasting with professional development.</li>
<li>Promises that you'll fall in love with a bottle of wine (or a producer) without the expensive, trial-and-error process of buying entires bottles of wine you've never tasted, and holding 100% of the risk in the event that you don't love them. (This process too often ends with the consumer throwing in the towel and just sticking with a wine they're not crazy about, but it at least the devil they know)</li>
<li>Offers a glass or small pours of wine that are in another world of quality and enjoyment than you're used to. Restaurant by-the-glass programs are run by two criteria alone:<ul>
<li>Finding wines that are designed to be simple and sweet, i.e. ""crowd pleasers"" AND</li>
<li>Enough mass production to ensure years' worth of continuity -- i.e. when the 2016 Kendall Jackson sells out, an allocation of the 2017 KJ is guaranteed, so that customers that have become used to it aren't asked to switch</li>
</ul>

We've flown into SFO at least 20 times in the last two years -- each time trading sleep for new discoveries, and shaking hands with winemakers that are chomping at the bit to show you the fruits of their labor. Now, the project is finally entering its final stage, having already:</p><p>-Signed a lease on the space (<strong>pictured above</strong>) adjacent to L.L. Bean's flagship store in downtown Freeport<br/>-Secured town and state licensing to serve wine and food<br/>-Completed its naming and branding project<br/>-Incorporated as an LLC and secured its Federal employment credentials<br/>-Worked with a local architect to plan the layout of the space<br/>-Begun design of the tasting bar itself<br/>-Procured numerous pieces of equipment<br/>-Secured supplier commitments from a number of family-owned wineries in CA and WA<br/>-Established relationships with local distributors, all of which have agreed to clear small lots of wine for us in order to support our business model as well as to lift up the overall Maine wine scene.</p><p>However, we need to raise one more round of capital in order to purchase furniture, exterior signage, bar construction materials, additional starting inventory, and a commercial-grade dishwasher. Once that is accomplished, there will be nothing holding us back from opening our doors and delivering on the promises outlined above. <strong>This won't be possible with your support</strong>, and as such, we've designed this campaign such that the rewards for contributions are not only generous, but geared towards creating a long-term relationship with our backers and making Toast feel like a place of their own*. Which is exactly how it should feel for anyone that gives to this cause and takes real action towards raising the profile of this amazing town, state, and region.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>*We tried really hard to come up a wide range of contributions and rewards, as well as special things that would only be available to this group of supporters (guided tour of Sonoma, anyone!?). That said, if you're interested in supporting this campaign, but have ideas or needs that aren't represented by any of the reward bundles that are listed, please contact me to put together something totally custom. IndieGoGo allows us to create a private contribution/rewards set, so if what you dream up is even remotely reasonable, you better believe we'll consider it. </p><p> </p><h3> </h3></div>","Calistoga, CA -- Summer of 2006This is where it all started.

That's right -- while drinking ultra-premium wine at the site where it's made can be a life experience and take your Instagram to a whole new level, it'll do little more to make you a wine connoisseur than asking for a restaurant's most expensive bottle on a date.No, that's not what I miss, and it's not what New England needs. When I was an intern, we'd schedule our one day off per week to include as many winery visits as time permitted. If the wineries focused on different varieties, and/or different subregions (Carneros vs. Stags Leap, for example), so much the better. At the end of those whirlwind days, we'd have tasted dozens of wines that -- if sold in bottle, and at retail -- were worth literally thousands.However, the cost for the whole day never added up to more than that of a single decent bottle. We'd go to bed totally exhausted, but with all five senses still fully activated, and a head full of knowledge that far surpassed what we'd learned working in the winery the other six days that week.  Plus, we still had a few dollars in our pocket when it was all over, and hadn't suffered any consequences for dumping out the wines that we didn't care for. I remain convinced to this day that this method -- trying as many wines as possible in a short period of time -- is by far the best, fastest, and least expensive way in existence to learn about wine.So Now What?OK, then, so if proximity to the vineyards and spectacular surroundings aren't essential to learning about wine, why are there more than 1,200 tasting rooms in Napa Valley alone, and basically zero in New England? You can't ship Sonoma itself out here, but you sure as hell can ship their wines, and we do exactly that to the tune of millions of bottles per year. So if geography isn't the problem, who's to blame for this??  Well, for starters:Global mass-production wineries. Let's pick on Veuve Cliquot for a random example. Is their yellow label Champagne twice as good as most options that cost half as much? Of course not. But their marketing department has a 200-year head start, and they sell 1.5 million cases (that's 18 million bottles!!) of the stuff every year, so a small California winery isn't going to open a tasting room or otherwise invest in building awareness in a market that is already dominated by one of these behemoths (e.g., Maine).-Distributors. Scouring the world -- or even a small corner of the country -- for the most amazing boutique wineries is extraordinarily hard. These vintners bottle just the tiniest amounts of their magic potion each year, and chances are that they've sold it all by the time you find them. On the other hand, buying a truckload of something mass-produced, sending that truck directly to Hannaford or BJ's, and mustering up the energy to find a bank branch at which to cash the check...is not hard. There are notable exceptions to this this course -- Martignetti in MA and Crush in ME, for example -- but overall it's the distributors that are closest to the source, and that far prefer money to wines of incredible value and distinction. It's mostly because of them that it's so hard for you to find a decent bottle of wine. Sommeliers. It kills me to say this about my industry brethren, but as averse to scouring the world as distributors are, most somms are the opposite. The problem is that they often forget that they're scouring on someone's behalf (yours), and not for themselves. They bring back obscure wines from obscure places, which is why you're going to have an easier time finding an Estonian Hasanski Sladki than a Californian Chardonnay at many wine bars these days. They try incredibly hard, but often fail to help the average consumer that's simply trying to figure out what producers to trust and what wines they like at the stores in their hometown. Culture. The wine country on the west coast of America is one of the most magical, magnetic, and utopian places on earth. That's why most of the people that love American wine live there. And while there are obviously a good number of amazing wine professionals on the east coast, most of the career options available to them are in the ultra-traditional areas of restaurant and retail. The ones that would like to innovate have a hard time doing so because of limited inventory in the area (see how it always comes back to the distributors??) and ancient, pro-distributor regulations that choke progress.  Time for a ChangeSo there you have it. For those reasons, plus a few others, that's why there's nowhere around here -- YET -- that:
Offers a wine retail experience that's interactive and educational
Features a ""producer spotlight"" -- i.e. sample a handful of one winery's lineup, the way you would in their tasting room, to get a feel for their ""house style"" across different varieties
Works tirelessly to bring in the best and most interesting wines in the country such that there's always something new to taste no matter how often you visit
Loves its customers even more than its wines, and is small enough to know each one by name and work as hard on keeping their favorites in stock as they do at finding them new discoveries.
Offers tasting opportunities for wineries that don't have their own tasting rooms and/or aren't open to the public.
Gives wine education and appreciation that you can actually use right away 
Offers an in-depth exploration of a specific region and/or variety -- for example, discover how Pinot Noir did in the (amazing) 2015 vintage by tasting several examples of the variety from different vineyards and subregions within Sonoma
Lets you explore the difference from vintage to vintage by tasting a ""vertical"", or a flight of wines from the same producer, variety, and vineyard, but from consecutive years.
Is a food and wine experience that's new, exciting, and entertaining
Gives a guided tour of wine that's focused on making you comfortable and engaged. No showing off or lecturing.
Is always trying to perform miracles for its regular customers, and inviting them in try limited allocations of rare, special wines that might not exist anywhere else in New England. 
Offers a quick, inexpensive, and grown-up diversion in downtown Freeport, not to mention a terrific place to pre-game when the line at Azure is out the door.
Is an experiential retail concept, but founded and operated by a career management consultant that would absolutely love to host a team-building tasting event for your group that blends the fun of wine tasting with professional development.
Promises that you'll fall in love with a bottle of wine (or a producer) without the expensive, trial-and-error process of buying entires bottles of wine you've never tasted, and holding 100% of the risk in the event that you don't love them. (This process too often ends with the consumer throwing in the towel and just sticking with a wine they're not crazy about, but it at least the devil they know)
Offers a glass or small pours of wine that are in another world of quality and enjoyment than you're used to. Restaurant by-the-glass programs are run by two criteria alone:
Finding wines that are designed to be simple and sweet, i.e. ""crowd pleasers"" AND
Enough mass production to ensure years' worth of continuity -- i.e. when the 2016 Kendall Jackson sells out, an allocation of the 2017 KJ is guaranteed, so that customers that have become used to it aren't asked to switch


It may all sound too good to be true, but with your cherished support, it soon won't be. We've flown into SFO at least 20 times in the last two years -- each time trading sleep for new discoveries, and shaking hands with winemakers that are chomping at the bit to show you the fruits of their labor. Now, the project is finally entering its final stage, having already:-Signed a lease on the space (pictured above) adjacent to L.L. Bean's flagship store in downtown Freeport-Secured town and state licensing to serve wine and food-Completed its naming and branding project-Incorporated as an LLC and secured its Federal employment credentials-Worked with a local architect to plan the layout of the space-Begun design of the tasting bar itself-Procured numerous pieces of equipment-Secured supplier commitments from a number of family-owned wineries in CA and WA-Established relationships with local distributors, all of which have agreed to clear small lots of wine for us in order to support our business model as well as to lift up the overall Maine wine scene.However, we need to raise one more round of capital in order to purchase furniture, exterior signage, bar construction materials, additional starting inventory, and a commercial-grade dishwasher. Once that is accomplished, there will be nothing holding us back from opening our doors and delivering on the promises outlined above. This won't be possible with your support, and as such, we've designed this campaign such that the rewards for contributions are not only generous, but geared towards creating a long-term relationship with our backers and making Toast feel like a place of their own*. Which is exactly how it should feel for anyone that gives to this cause and takes real action towards raising the profile of this amazing town, state, and region.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*We tried really hard to come up a wide range of contributions and rewards, as well as special things that would only be available to this group of supporters (guided tour of Sonoma, anyone!?). That said, if you're interested in supporting this campaign, but have ideas or needs that aren't represented by any of the reward bundles that are listed, please contact me to put together something totally custom. IndieGoGo allows us to create a private contribution/rewards set, so if what you dream up is even remotely reasonable, you better believe we'll consider it.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hello, My name is Ishmael. Ivan Ishmael.</h3>
<p>I am a father of three beautiful girls. I have been working at my current job for the last 15 years. Though I love working with the people at work, I feel its time to reach for something bigger. I have had vegetable gardens for a great many years. Talking to people about the gardens I have noticed that people are reluctant to invest time in a vegetable garden because they feel that it may be too challenging. </p>
<p>My Back Yard Farm La is here to simplify everything. This is an opportunity to provide a service that may have the potential to improve the quality of life for a great many people. We go to your home. We prep the ground install the frame, mix the soil, and plant the seeds. We do this on a 4 foot by 4-foot section big enough to enjoy, and small enough to keep it fun. Creating these vegetable gardens has two major benefits for me. First, I am sharing the love and skills to make things grow. Growing your own veggies even if its just a few beans for a grade school project can be a profound experience. Second, this is an opportunity to serve others. It took me a while to develop an idea that would not only help my family and me but that also had the potential to help my community and the people around me.  </p>
<p> There is an old saying, ""the field is white and ready to harvest."" That means that now is the time to go and put in the work. People are waking up to the idea that it is important to eat healthy and nutritious food. Also, that growing your food gives you more control and better quality. Your help will have a multiplying effect. With your help, I will be able to reach a great many people. Those people will gain the knowledge to teach their families and friends. A chain of knowledge and skills starts to form that we can keep adding links to. Now is the time to make a difference. </p>
<p>The gardens we will put together will be 4x4 raised beds. These are a perfect size to start learning, or a nice size that is easy to maintain. Some of the possible combinations are:</p>

<p><i>Strawberries grow low to the ground. The strawberries will fill all the corners. In the center you can have blue berry bushes or rhubarb.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Ambedo Italian Cuisine is a startup company focused on mobile sustainability while providing delicious and local cuisine to the public at the same time. Our vision starts at a food truck but reaches beyond what we have planned currently. Leaders in any industry need to realize how important implementing sustainable business practices are and how our consumeristic society as it stands cannot continue to consume in the way we do today. Ambedo is here to change and challenge the way mobile and brick and mortar restaurants do business and to hopefully be the leader in sustainable innovation that can keep restaurants and food trucks around for decades to come.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Menu</strong></h3>
<p>We're working with multiple local businesses here in Colorado to try and source our products as locally as possible to minimize our impact on the environment as well as preparing all of our food from scratch. We plan to offer seasonal menus throughout the year to offer variety in our menu and to utilize fresh ingredients offered by Colorado growers throughout the seasons. We're also working with local ranchers and farmers to provide the best quality proteins we can find. Our animal products will never be treated with antibiotics or hormones and are raised humanely and naturally.</p>

<p>Ambedo Italian Cuisine is a crowdfunded project and can only come to life with your help! Many of the perks we have not only help fund us for everything we need to get started but also benefit you as well when we open! We have perks from getting invited to our grand opening party all the way to a personal catering event for 50 and even links to our Free Italian Food For a Year giveaway*. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact you're making by backing this campaign goes farther than just receiving food or getting a sticker. It's an investment in our future and for future generations to be able to eat at a restaurant or mobile business and not to feel guilty, but rather pride in knowing that the businesses you support have a positive impact on the environment and that your favorite place that you support will be there for generations to come. It's about being able to be apart of a movement that will shake the world and inspire others. It's about doing whats right. As mentioned in our video, we are trying to make a difference by implementing solar panels on our truck and running off of a battery instead of a gas-powered generator to power our food truck. All of our packaging is compostable down to the cutlery and we offer compost and recycle bins outside of our truck to curb the amount of waste that goes into landfills and are also working with Scraps composting services to be able to get our compost to the right place, just to name a few of many of the ways we're trying to make a difference. We're a concept trying to become a reality to prove that great food can still come at a sustainable level and if it can be done on a food truck, it can be done anywhere!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As we strive to be as innovative as possible in how business is done in the mobile food industry, there are still some major challenges that need to be overcome to become completely sustainable. One of the biggest challenges is replacing the gasoline-fueled engine that almost every truck possesses into an electrically powered vehicle. We have dreams to work with Telsa in the future to possibly team up to tackle the issue of sustainable food trucks. Also, it would be pretty cool to have food trucks on Mars. </p>
<p>Another challenge is teaching the public about sustainability, composting and recycling. Sadly, for many, waste is of no concern. It does not affect their daily lives and with how efficient our waste collection services are, it's hard to see the impact on our daily waste but it continues to grow on a daily basis out of our site. Every leader, in all industries, needs to find a way to make their practices sustainable but also must seek an informative way to educate a consumer on how to dispose of their product in a way that doesn't end up in a landfill. Ambedo has plans to implement a waste disposal system that is consistent and informative to ensure the right ""waste"" is going into the right bin. We put waste in quotations because when placed in the proper bin, ""waste"" is actually a renewable resource that can then be used to make other resources or products such as composting being used as fertilizer for future crops, or plastic and aluminum being continuously recycled into itself. Although not everyone knows exactly where to place their soda can or paper plate, we are still making efforts to be able to inform the public on how to properly get rid of the post-consumer product. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're behind everything were about but don't have the funds to support us, that's okay. We have many ways that can help us still spread the word! Here are a few options.</p>
<p>1. Share this campaign on social media and tell everyone about it!</p>

All of our packaging is compostable down to the cutlery and we offer compost and recycle bins outside of our truck to curb the amount of waste that goes into landfills and are also working with Scraps composting services to be able to get our compost to the right place, just to name a few of many of the ways we're trying to make a difference. We're a concept trying to become a reality to prove that great food can still come at a sustainable level and if it can be done on a food truck, it can be done anywhere!

Risks & Challenges
As we strive to be as innovative as possible in how business is done in the mobile food industry, there are still some major challenges that need to be overcome to become completely sustainable. One of the biggest challenges is replacing the gasoline-fueled engine that almost every truck possesses into an electrically powered vehicle. We have dreams to work with Telsa in the future to possibly team up to tackle the issue of sustainable food trucks. Also, it would be pretty cool to have food trucks on Mars. 
Another challenge is teaching the public about sustainability, composting and recycling. Sadly, for many, waste is of no concern. It does not affect their daily lives and with how efficient our waste collection services are, it's hard to see the impact on our daily waste but it continues to grow on a daily basis out of our site. Every leader, in all industries, needs to find a way to make their practices sustainable but also must seek an informative way to educate a consumer on how to dispose of their product in a way that doesn't end up in a landfill. Ambedo has plans to implement a waste disposal system that is consistent and informative to ensure the right ""waste"" is going into the right bin. We put waste in quotations because when placed in the proper bin, ""waste"" is actually a renewable resource that can then be used to make other resources or products such as composting being used as fertilizer for future crops, or plastic and aluminum being continuously recycled into itself. Although not everyone knows exactly where to place their soda can or paper plate, we are still making efforts to be able to inform the public on how to properly get rid of the post-consumer product.

<p><b>Welcome to La’Ebony©..</b><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The intention of my business is to get Afro art inspired products
onto the high street, by renovating an abandoned building into a jaw droppingly
colourtastic store with my products and to gather the funds for the completion
of #ProjectLaEbony in which I aim to illustrate, write and publish 500 books to
send to underprivileged children in Africa.</p>

<p>
<b><span>So c'mon! Let's give the UK high streets a stroke of colour and create a
store with a feel like no other!</span></b></p>
<p><b><span></span></b><span><span>The goal and soul purpose is to get Afro art inspired
products onto the high street, to grab the general public by their tired eyes
and bring some life into the cold concrete, we want people to love themselves
by having La'Ebony<strong>©</strong> products on their books and shelves. Now let's get the
spring back in our step and create a store that will put the Las Vegas lights
to shame! </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br/>
</span></span><strong>Not to be funny, but what are you going to do with our
money?</strong><span><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><span>The money raised by you lovely people will help go
towards buying, renovating and decorating an old building into the funkiest
Afro art store ever! Bright colours, animal prints, huge Afros, silk smooth
creations and the coolest hand designed products all created by myself. Are you
ready for an amalgamation of awesomeness that will make you want to do
backflips of joy? Oh you are? Well keep reading and prepare to have your world
colourfully flipped upside down! (Don't worry we don't expect you to do
backflips but if you can don't hesitate to)</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>#ProjectLaebony BOOK:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>£12,000 will cover the costs of producing, printing, developing and shipping 500 La'Ebony children's books to send to young children in underdeveloped parts of Africa. <br/>This part of the campaign is strictly non-profit, meaning La'Ebony<strong>©</strong> will only be using this sector of the donations to give the books free of charge as a token of thanks to those whom we take off every day. <br/>As I will be hand illustrating the book I will be doing my upmost to ensure the book is as beautiful as the children they are  going to go to, however in order to do this we will need to raise the funds to carry out this project, La'Ebony<strong>©</strong> will not be financially benefiting from this gesture.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Abandoned building Project:<br/></strong>The remaining £66,000 will go towards buying an abandoned building to create the La'Ebony<strong>©</strong> store. The donations will cover the cost of the following:<br/><br/>-Insurance policies.<br/>-Initial Tax, License, Planning Permission and Consent Cost Requirements.<br/>-Labour work such as Electricity and Plumbing I.e providing the store with Initial heating, electricity,  hot water and proper drainage. <br/>-Interior and Exterior maintenance as well as Painting and Decorating E.g plastering, blasting and sealing which will ensure the building will not be subject to any decay, dampness and corrosion of walls/floors.<br/>-Any Downpayment's required to secure the location in order to start renovating the store.</span></p>

As I hand design all of my products and hand make my own dolls, bookmarks and
notebooks the money will also go towards sourcing out the right manufacturers
so I can make the colour blasting and funktastic products on a mass scale that
will have the public wanting to two step all the way to the checkout line! </span></p>

<p><strong>Above:</strong> La'Ebony© Hand-crafted dolls, Hair, clothing and accessories all created by myself</p>
<p><span>The store will also be host
to art classes for the public and local community, a place where everyone,
especially women and children and even more especially for women and children
of colour from all walks of life to express themselves in a colourful and
creative way, with the help of workshops and programmes that will create a
strong community cohesion, a store like this is truly needed.</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>As I use software to edit
and finalise some of my funktastic designs, the money raised by your donations will
also go towards helping me pay for the software I use, although my passion for
my work is enough to create a blanket of warmth around this cold globe, I
sometimes struggle to pay for the necessary programmes that are fundamental for
my business to run. With your help I will be able to kiss the days of worrying
about software payments and programmes being cut off goodbye and will be able
to concentrate more on making products that will make you flash smiles that
reach the sky! </p>

<p><strong>Why is Afro artistry so important to me?</strong><span><br/>
<br/>
As a child I grew up living in a society where I noticed that all the pretty
princesses, beautiful queens, elegant dolls and cute toys did not look like me,
like many other black girls I grew up believing that if my hair was not a
certain texture, my skin was not a certain shade and if my features were not
European then I was not beautiful or as pretty as the toys I played with. <br/>
<br/>
This impression of beauty has proven to be very destructive in my community,
causing many girls of colour in my community to adapt to a standard of beauty
that is the complete opposite of how they were naturally born. Those little
girls who felt that they were not beautiful because of their melanated skin and
kinky hair have been permanently damaged from the negative images the media
creates in relation to women of colour and from the chemicals they put in their
hair and skin to conform to a standard of beauty that is completely opposite to
them.<br/>
</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>We
are all different, diverse and our cultures range, but together we can make a
change!</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><span>I felt it was time to reverse this cycle in a fresh and flavoursome way so that
the next generation of little melanated girls will be proud of how they look
and be proud of the skin they’re in. This collectively inspired me to create
La'Ebony, where I design and create afro art products such as Dolls, Mugs,
Canvases and much more frobulous products that can be loved by everyone no
matter their skin colour, but to upscale from selling from a computer and phone
in my back breakingly cramped room to my own store I will need your help. <br/></span></span><span><span><br/></span></span><img class=""lazy"" data-cke-saved-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451837734/tqe9mzhejdnavznamsk5.jpg"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451837734/tqe9mzhejdnavznamsk5.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 526px; height: 526px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>

I feel it is important for young girls to grow up feeling it is cool to be
intelligent, which is why I have a range of distinctively bubbly products

<p>I feel my products inspire more women, especially women of colour to become
even more intelligent and to feel motivated in accomplishing their goals no
matter how much society tries to put them down, no one should feel they can't
do something because of their sex or race, and if I raise the funds for my own
store with your help I will be able to reach the rest of the public and give
them a shot of some La'Ebony<strong>©</strong> flavour!  I want women to be comfortable in
thinking like a queen as well as looking like one, so come on, let’s show them
where we are coming from! </p>
<p><span>I have also created my own
limited edition La'Ebony<strong>©</strong> Barbie style dolls, whose hair is as big and bubbly as
the girls they were made for! With your help I will be able to find the right
manufacturers to make the limited edition dolls into a full fleet of
funky ebony dolls oozing with elegance so no one has to feel that they are not
a beautiful princess because of their skin, along with finding the right
manufacturers for the dolls, the donations will also go towards producing all
of my products on a mass scale with manufacturers who actually care about the
people and products they are working with and making, ready to be placed into
the cave of colour that will be the La'Ebony<strong>©</strong> store! <br/>

I am also working on my own children's book to send to African villages in a
bid to promote education and motivation in the less fortunate parts of the continent,
living in the UK we take many of our day to day resources from the African
people without really saying ""Thank You"", so I feel it's only fair we
give something back to those who are always giving to us and show we love and
appreciate them. With your generous donations I will be able to complete this
project and may be able to carry out more initiatives like this and paint
La'Ebony on the global canvas! <br/>

</strong></div>","Welcome to La’Ebony©..


The intention of my business is to get Afro art inspired products
onto the high street, by renovating an abandoned building into a jaw droppingly
colourtastic store with my products and to gather the funds for the completion
of #ProjectLaEbony in which I aim to illustrate, write and publish 500 books to
send to underprivileged children in Africa.


So c'mon! Let's give the UK high streets a stroke of colour and create a
store with a feel like no other!
The goal and soul purpose is to get Afro art inspired
products onto the high street, to grab the general public by their tired eyes
and bring some life into the cold concrete, we want people to love themselves
by having La'Ebony© products on their books and shelves. Now let's get the
spring back in our step and create a store that will put the Las Vegas lights
to shame! 

Not to be funny, but what are you going to do with our
money? 
The money raised by you lovely people will help go
towards buying, renovating and decorating an old building into the funkiest
Afro art store ever! Bright colours, animal prints, huge Afros, silk smooth
creations and the coolest hand designed products all created by myself. Are you
ready for an amalgamation of awesomeness that will make you want to do
backflips of joy? Oh you are? Well keep reading and prepare to have your world
colourfully flipped upside down! (Don't worry we don't expect you to do
backflips but if you can don't hesitate to)

#ProjectLaebony BOOK:
£12,000 will cover the costs of producing, printing, developing and shipping 500 La'Ebony children's books to send to young children in underdeveloped parts of Africa. This part of the campaign is strictly non-profit, meaning La'Ebony© will only be using this sector of the donations to give the books free of charge as a token of thanks to those whom we take off every day. As I will be hand illustrating the book I will be doing my upmost to ensure the book is as beautiful as the children they are  going to go to, however in order to do this we will need to raise the funds to carry out this project, La'Ebony© will not be financially benefiting from this gesture.
Abandoned building Project:The remaining £66,000 will go towards buying an abandoned building to create the La'Ebony© store. The donations will cover the cost of the following:-Insurance policies.-Initial Tax, License, Planning Permission and Consent Cost Requirements.-Labour work such as Electricity and Plumbing I.e providing the store with Initial heating, electricity,  hot water and proper drainage. -Interior and Exterior maintenance as well as Painting and Decorating E.g plastering, blasting and sealing which will ensure the building will not be subject to any decay, dampness and corrosion of walls/floors.-Any Downpayment's required to secure the location in order to start renovating the store.


As I hand design all of my products and hand make my own dolls, bookmarks and
notebooks the money will also go towards sourcing out the right manufacturers
so I can make the colour blasting and funktastic products on a mass scale that
will have the public wanting to two step all the way to the checkout line! 


Above: La'Ebony© Hand-crafted dolls, Hair, clothing and accessories all created by myself
The store will also be host
to art classes for the public and local community, a place where everyone,
especially women and children and even more especially for women and children
of colour from all walks of life to express themselves in a colourful and
creative way, with the help of workshops and programmes that will create a
strong community cohesion, a store like this is truly needed.

As I use software to edit
and finalise some of my funktastic designs, the money raised by your donations will
also go towards helping me pay for the software I use, although my passion for
my work is enough to create a blanket of warmth around this cold globe, I
sometimes struggle to pay for the necessary programmes that are fundamental for
my business to run. With your help I will be able to kiss the days of worrying
about software payments and programmes being cut off goodbye and will be able
to concentrate more on making products that will make you flash smiles that
reach the sky! 

If you believe in people
power and everyone coming together to help the high street get a new store that
cares for the people with an epically fresh, fabulous and fantastic pallet,
then don't hesitate, vote with your wallet! We can't wait to see your big
smiles and vibrant spirits walking into our store! 




Why is Afro artistry so important to me?

As a child I grew up living in a society where I noticed that all the pretty
princesses, beautiful queens, elegant dolls and cute toys did not look like me,
like many other black girls I grew up believing that if my hair was not a
certain texture, my skin was not a certain shade and if my features were not
European then I was not beautiful or as pretty as the toys I played with. 

This impression of beauty has proven to be very destructive in my community,
causing many girls of colour in my community to adapt to a standard of beauty
that is the complete opposite of how they were naturally born. Those little
girls who felt that they were not beautiful because of their melanated skin and
kinky hair have been permanently damaged from the negative images the media
creates in relation to women of colour and from the chemicals they put in their
hair and skin to conform to a standard of beauty that is completely opposite to
them.


We
are all different, diverse and our cultures range, but together we can make a
change! 
I felt it was time to reverse this cycle in a fresh and flavoursome way so that
the next generation of little melanated girls will be proud of how they look
and be proud of the skin they’re in. This collectively inspired me to create
La'Ebony, where I design and create afro art products such as Dolls, Mugs,
Canvases and much more frobulous products that can be loved by everyone no
matter their skin colour, but to upscale from selling from a computer and phone
in my back breakingly cramped room to my own store I will need your help. 


Too cool for school, fresh enough for La'Ebony©!

I feel it is important for young girls to grow up feeling it is cool to be
intelligent, which is why I have a range of distinctively bubbly products
dedicated to stationary, such as awesome handmade Notebooks, Pretty Pencil
Cases and Boomtastic Bookmarks all with a special coat of La'Ebony© Magic that
will make you want to write down your wildest stories and delve into your
favourite books once again and find some new classics along the way! 



I feel my products inspire more women, especially women of colour to become
even more intelligent and to feel motivated in accomplishing their goals no
matter how much society tries to put them down, no one should feel they can't
do something because of their sex or race, and if I raise the funds for my own
store with your help I will be able to reach the rest of the public and give
them a shot of some La'Ebony© flavour!  I want women to be comfortable in
thinking like a queen as well as looking like one, so come on, let’s show them
where we are coming from! 
I have also created my own
limited edition La'Ebony© Barbie style dolls, whose hair is as big and bubbly as
the girls they were made for! With your help I will be able to find the right
manufacturers to make the limited edition dolls into a full fleet of
funky ebony dolls oozing with elegance so no one has to feel that they are not
a beautiful princess because of their skin, along with finding the right
manufacturers for the dolls, the donations will also go towards producing all
of my products on a mass scale with manufacturers who actually care about the
people and products they are working with and making, ready to be placed into
the cave of colour that will be the La'Ebony© store! 



#ProjectLaebony
I am also working on my own children's book to send to African villages in a
bid to promote education and motivation in the less fortunate parts of the continent,
living in the UK we take many of our day to day resources from the African
people without really saying ""Thank You"", so I feel it's only fair we
give something back to those who are always giving to us and show we love and
appreciate them. With your generous donations I will be able to complete this
project and may be able to carry out more initiatives like this and paint
La'Ebony on the global canvas! 

 

Why are we so sure that we will soar? I have already sold internationally to the United States,
Germany and to a woman in the Army! I feel if we raise the funds to create a
store for my brand I will be able to reach the far corners of the world, one
sassy product at a time! 
Smiles
that stretch for miles! 
The hard work of hand designing and making my products is always worthwhile
when I see the bright smiles of my customers posing with their fresh new
products, I have a whole section of my customers with their products on my
blog, one day I hope to have a whole wall full of pictures in my store with all
the lovely diverse faces that have bought my products! You can also view all of
my funkylicious products on my website, I will insert all the relevant links
below so you know where to go! 





Love
makes the world go round!I receive heart-warming messages from supporters telling me how my business has
helped change their or their child's life, La'Ebony© has only been running for
under a year, I sell from a computer in my room and have already made a

with mass produced unique products imagine how much of a difference we can all
make! Teamwork makes the dream PERKTo say Thank you for your contribution, at the end of the campaign, there will be a considerable amount of people chosen to receive a La'Ebony goodie bag. The contents of each goodie bag will vary depending on the contribution amount, whether it be small or big - remember the more you donate the more your goodie bag will contain but will be equally as incredible no matter the size or content. Donations over £100 will include a CUSTOM CANVAS! Thank you in advance for your support!

want to design a coffee house that is specifically designed to be a place where community meets and people can come together and improve themselves and
improve their lives. The perfect equilibrium between coffee and art.Although we will be a for-profit business, we are on a mission to promote positive interactions in the community and to expand the accessibility to art for everyone who comes into our shop, no matter the reason. 

So we asked 4 important questions

Question #1 Why does art matter to you?
Artists from the community will be featured on the walls of the GM Gallery. Good Mornings Coffeehouse & Art Gallery is happy just offering the space to these individuals who are just starting out on their artistic journey. 



Our Artists will be members of the community or organizations, such as schools, and each exhibit will be kicked off with an artist reception for the budding artists and their family and friends. The art will be available for purchase, and all of the money will go straight to the artist. Question #2 What can art teach us?

By offering art-related workshops, creative classes, and local art exhibitions, we will put art and coffee on an equal footing in our coffee house. No more will the creative side of this business be a mere incidental. Rather, just as much as we will be pushing our line of food and beverage products, we will be pushing an idea too. We will place art front and center, right alongside the pastry displays and our menu of diverse drinks


In addition to gourmet coffee, offerings will include espresso, drip coffee, lattes, smoothies, muffins, breads, cookies, scones, and rolls, with seasonal variations as appropriate. A well-known, well-established bakery will provide all of our pastries fresh every day, and our customers will come to expect only the finest dining from Good Mornings.
Question #3 What work of art has moved you?

Again, however, it is impossible to stress this enough: the Good Mornings experience will be just as much about seeing, creating, and experiencing art as it is about getting a quality cup of coffee.  We are putting together a uniquely styled coffeehouse that will have art and community at its heart.Question #4 What's your best museum/art moment?

</div></div>","""The Juice Bar DREAM""
In two words, plenty of dreams and the most successful business plan ...

www.thejuicebars.gr









 We were used to talk about the limited options, the things that actually were missing... We were seeking the pure, the healthy and the true full Greek taste from our childhood memories time.  Fresh ideas and endless talks for hours and hours created our Logo and our unique ""Recharge your Day"" slogan. Instead of the typical Juice bar  which you will  probably find in the most western capitals we reinvented flavors and mixed in the most balanced way our fruits while we offered a huge variety of supreme coffees.  We introduced the best espresso around the city and of course our favorite: Freddo Espresso (cold espresso), Freddo Cappuccino (cold Cappuccino) and Ice cold Nescafe. 




 Starting from the scratch visited more than 500 farms around Greece for developing our Cold Pressed Juice menu while our extremely experienced baristi were preparing the best coffee drinks globally available. The Best varieties of Greek pure organic fruits chosen while the effort of an Eco balance sustainability was first in to our list.  
One of us is the Marketeer, with the most relevant studies and professional background, and the other one is the Mixologist who created the most amazing flavors. The result was magical and inspired more than fifty people to work for a common dream-THE JUICE BAR DREAM !!


The ideal property had to be full of natural elements, like wood, stone and raw metal. Centrally located and with a lot of friends helping in the tough transformation procedure we introduced the first ""The Juice Bar"" 26th of November with an unbelievable rate of new and returning customers. 


The Expansion Process
The demand was so high that in less than three months we are counting three beautiful health and wellness spots. Major newspapers and magazines dedicated multiple articles which helped our flavors to reach thousands of extremely happy customers. The marketeer is constantly  looking for the gaps in the Market and focusing in the entry barriers while the mixologist is preparing endlessly mixed seasonal juices and unique coffee recipes for the spring.






Big international players put money in the table to take over the Logo and the slogan along with our Juice bars but that is simply against our philosophy and our dream. After all is not all about making money... but creating money for and with the people... Here, is were we need your help by contributing in money or simply by posting this campaign in your profile and make extremely loud noise. We believe in people and the things we may achieve all together. We don't really need multinational companies or strong governments to fulfill our dreams and sustain our local economy. In the Greece of today..the Greece of crisis we offer the best product in the best possible price while we provide well paid jobs in a family environment with a big warm smile. 
Your contribution will help us establish ""The Juice Bar"" in London -- the first people centered Greek business in the capital of the United Kingdom. We are going to use the construction materials from local Greek companies and a humanitarian bridge between the local bio farms is going to be active in the whole way.
We are not worried of the business risk since the Consumers love the Greek pure products and the success is gonna be huge. We simply need your HELP and of course we will never forget our supporters and we will have the chance to pay back your Love and contribution in every possible way.




Some last details: In April we will be in London examining properties and solving legislative issues while updating our friends around the globe through our website:

It must be noted that Rachel’s journey to realize her dream has not been easy as completing a law degree, volunteering her strategic planning skills with a non-profit organization, and planning a business of her own have led to many restless nights. However, her dream is one that will help everyone to sleep easier - both figuratively and literally - as she plans to launch a cut and sew facility that will manufacture luxury bed sheets, and provide more manufacturing jobs in Durham. </span></p><p><span>A quick Google© search defines luxury as “the state of great comfort…” --- Indeed, we spend 1/3 of our lives sleeping (presumably dreaming), the other 2/3 should be spent living life to the fullest and taking chances to achieve a state of great comfort. Rachel wants to provide dreamers, thinkers, and doers of all shapes and sizes with comfy bed sheets for that 1/3 of the time that is spent sleeping. Therefore, she is asking you to help her take this chance with the other 2/3 of her life and help get her company where she has dreamed it can be. </span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p>​</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FGyvwKh53oGE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGyvwKh53oGE&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FGyvwKh53oGE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><br/><p><b>Our Needs.

Sell Fresh, Local FoodWHAT IT IS:  SkyFarms creates consumer access to farmers and empty spaces nearby that can be used as farms, to grow, sell and buy fresh, nutrient rich food.WHO WE ARE:  SkyFarms is a platform that aims to bring a farming demand to market by creating access to local farmers, and space for local farms, to provide fresh grown food for the local consumer.NASA innovations have shifted when, where and how we approach agriculture by developing a sustainable process of growing nutrient rich food in a soilless mist medium, requiring less space, energy, water and time, making it possible to grow quality food by anyone, anywhere, at anytime.  It is called Aeroponics. Driven by urbanization, sustainability, economic volatility, and technology, we have entered an emergent financial market that provides access to goods and services.  It is disrupting, and in some cases, replacing ownership.  It is called the shareconomy. In 2020, 70% of the population will live in urban cities.  Virtually all of these cities produce is outsourced and shipped in from hundreds of miles away.  Yet, many of these city's commercial and residential space sits empty and unused, and can be transformed into farms.  The solution is SkyFarms.The challenge facing potential business farmers today who want to grow their own food locally isn't desire or capability, it's access to space.

<p>Hi, I'm Susan Metzger. Three years ago I had a series of unfortunate car emergencies within a short period of time. (No, I wasn't driving a carton jalopy.) I was unprepared to handle any of them and had to rely on roadside services and good Samaritans.</p>
<p>I researched auto kits to be able to equip myself with the right tools and know how for the future. I found the kits on the market to be confusing, poorly assembled and intimidating. As a woman driver I wanted to have a kit I was proud to own and confident to utilize. </p>
<p>With that in mind FLARED was founded. Our mission is to educate women drivers about auto emergency safety and provide them with the tools they need to be secure and empowered drivers. We wanted to design a kit that was organized, aesthetically pleasing, and user friendly. </p>
<p>We felt that one of the still standing stereotypes is that
many women are not as knowledgeable or hands on with their cars like men
are. They tend to rely on their husbands/ brothers/ fathers to help them out in an auto related crisis.  By putting together this kit, we felt that women drivers would be better
equipped and confident to handle any car related emergencies. Even if professional auto assistance is necessary, the tools in the kit will help drivers stay safe until help arrives</p>
<p>We’ve carefully sourced and
tested all our materials, including some custom fabrications, with an eye to
value and quality.The classic FLARED kit includes jumper cables, box cutter, duct tape, first aid kit, flashlight, glow sticks, hand sanitizer, ice scraper , guidebook, pen, pepper spray, poncho, reflection belt, screwdriver, twine, tissues, and a tire gauge. Our deluxe model has all of the above in addition to a water bottle, sport jelly beans, an LED flare, power bank, and umbrella. 

</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As will all new startup ventures, there is a limited amount of risk involved. At FLARED, we attempted to predict any potential problems that may come up with manufacturing and shipping. Based on our experience and incredible group of professionals on the FLARED team, we have solutions ready for these problems. We’re passionate about this project and will do whatever it takes to see it through, and build a safer more empowered community of women drivers.</p>
<p><b>When you back our
goal, you’re helping to build a community of safe, empowered drivers. We’d like
to send a big thanks your way for showing your support for the FLARED movement.

<p><b>Why Copper City Brewing?:</b></p>
<p>With a population of over
30,000 people and a National Monument that attracts nearly 90,000 visitors each year, Rome does not have a microbrewery. Rome's brewing history began around 1851
and existed in full force until roughly 1920. An attempt to revive it after prohibition was unsuccessful and the industry simply faded away. </p>
<p>Copper City Brewing Company will celebrate this rich history by bringing the
brewing industry BACK to its rightful home in Rome, NY. Imagine an attractive gathering place where you can enjoy a hand
crafted pint of beer, a tasting flight or even a glass of wine from one of our many great NY wineries. You'll be surrounded by copper, steel, and historical photos, capturing the manufacturing industry
that helped shape Rome for centuries. We will highlight &amp; pay homage to our impressive history while we progress forward to a new day. </p>
<p><b>Where the money goes:</b></p>
<p>We have invested a $100,000 of our savings to purchase the brewery site, and estimate an additional investment of $200,000 to complete renovations &amp; purchase the brewing equipment. Your contributions will provide up front capital. Together, we will give the building an amazing face lift and create one of the best gathering
places in Rome. To thank you for your contribution, you will be
rewarded with some very cool perks; from Copper City merchandise, to ""Beer for
Life,"" Brewmaster-for-a-Day, and private catered parties in the tasting room. Every contribution receives a gift. Every contribution is appreciated. </p>
<p><b>Impact:</b></p>
<p>Rome needs this. Breweries
are a destination for craft beer lovers &amp; it is proven that craft breweries have a POSITIVE IMPACT on communities. Rome will draw more visitors
as a result of the brewery, and these travelers will be consumers for other
businesses in the city, including shops, hotels, restaurants and our many historic sites. Additionally, breweries are known CATALYSTS for
new small businesses such as restaurants and retail shops, and often
compliment recreational activities such as cycling, running, and sightseeing.
</p>
<p>This project will join the transformation already taking place in East Rome and the brewery will create jobs. Just a few, at first, but with enough community &amp; regional support, we believe an expansion is inevitable. </p>
<p>By supporting this campaign you are making a DIRECT IMPACT in changing the city’s image. You can have a hand in helping us create a business that Romans can be proud of and to which visitors will flock. YOUR GENEROSITY WILL HELP US CHANGE ROME, not just help build a brewery. </p>
<p>The building is located off of E. Dominick St, near Rt 49 and directly across from the Rt 365 off ramp. It is situated at a main entrance into the city from both the east &amp; the west and positioned perfectly for making a POSITIVE first impression.  </p>
<p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
<p>We can brew great beer, but
making enough for everyone in our basement is impossible. To provide this area
with ample craft beer we have to make 150 gallons at a time and that is
expensive. With 1/3 of our money already invested, making this campaign successful is very important. Many of our expenses are immediate (licensing,
inspections, renovations, equipment down payments, etc…) and receiving our loans &amp; grants are still weeks to months out. Your assistance will provide the springboard we need to get this project off the ground by our target date of Fall 2016. </p>

inspections, renovations, equipment down payments, etc…) and receiving our loans & grants are still weeks to months out. Your assistance will provide the springboard we need to get this project off the ground by our target date of Fall 2016. 
Message from the owners:

Dan and Lori & Eric and Erica would like to thank you for your support in helping us bring this new venture to Rome.We live here, we love it
here, and we will serve this city until we lift our last pint.

    Other Ways You Can Help We know that some of you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Ask people to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!

Cycle Farms Inc was founded to rehabilitate urban land with the goal of encouraging
an agrarian lifestyle in Fayetteville and as a model for other cities across
the US.  We focus on farming fresh, naturally grown food that we share
with our neighbors who struggle with food insecurity. A third of the food we
grow is shared with our volunteers, a third is distributed those in need, and a
third is sold at our Crossroads Farmers’ Market. At Tri Cycle Farms Inc we
educate children from pre-k through college about gardening, growing, and the
importance of eating fresh food. We teach young people and families about
building structures from gardens, to sheds, to chicken coops. Tri Cycle Farms
Inc. strives to bring people back to a simple way of life that focuses on
fresh, naturally grown food, a lifestyle of generosity, with a goal to decrease
food insecurity. Donating to our organization will directly impact the lives of

We are located in the Uptown neighborhood of Chicago which is a multi-cultural, economically diverse area that did not have any shared work spaces prior to our launch in 2014.
In just 1 year of operation we've:



Supported and promoted over 80 members on social media, in weekly newsletters, at community events, and in-person


Hosted more than 25 Lunches and Socials for Members to initiate networking and collaboration opportunities and build a professional community


Taught over 30 classes attended by over 450 people


Provided more than 50 hours of free meeting space for community groups


Donated over $1,000 in coworking services to local nonprofits



In order to serve and support more people in our community, The Shift is raising $25,000 to renovate our space so that we can increase our member capacity, improve functionality and comfort of our workspace, and widen our array of professional services and learning opportunities for all.

Your contribution to our campaign will allow us to:


Increase professional services available (ex: legal, accounting, tech, marketing)
Increase classes and workshops for both members and the general public
Buy additional desks, chairs, and office amenities to increase our capacity
Build a kitchen, countertop bar, and cafe seating area for members and events
Add lounge furniture for members and visitors to de-stress
Add sound absorbing panels to reduce noise and echo
Add additional electrical outlets, air circulation fans, lockers, and mailboxes
Add rugs, plants, and artwork for a cozier, more comfortable environment


To see a list of our previous classes & events, click here.

To express our gratitude and to keep in line with our mission to support and improve our local community, The Shift will donate 5% of its operating profit to a neighborhood nonprofit or community group effecting positive social change. This donation will continue throughout the life of our company!



Just a few of the organizations we plan to donate to: 
Sarah's Circle, RefugeeOne, Chicago Market, Lakeview Pantry, Buena Park Neighbors, Uptown United, Inspiration Cafe, Chinese Mutual Aid Association


What We Need & What You Get

 We are hoping to raise at least $25,000 which will allow us to remodel and improve our space for current members and event attendees, while increasing our capacity for new members, class offerings, and professional services.

Being an engineer, I can't help but to develop things i see in front of me. I picked the oil palm leaf. The one trivialized but in reality carries many benefits.

People discarded oil palm fronds when take the fruit that use to make vegetable cooking oil. I realized that the leaf can be made into livestock feed and the rib can be benefits in pulp and textile industry.But to make oil palm fronds as livestock feed, the leaf and mid-rib must be separated.

The oil palm leaf as livestock feed have many benefits. Besides the leaf that have many health components in it and high crude protein,the oil palm land itself can be used for the goat or cow to roam free, so they can play and socialize with each other. This is more humane than compact, overcrowded shed that being use widely in livestock industry.

In the mid process, i also invent machine to make broom from oil palm rib and i realize that broom that made from oil palm rib is very practical in real life sweeping.

So, this is the post all about, the broom (KestenBroom) after-all. To ask for funding to build more machines for it, to buy raw material and to rent small factory to operate and cost to commercialize it such as register on Alibaba.com.
Why don't i ask funding for my leaf-rib separator machine instead? It is more profitable and beneficial to the world, right? The answer to that question is: it needs a lot of funding-cost to complete the machine such as  buy oil palm land, goat, milking equipment, silage and many more to realize a pioneer plan so government and big companies can see for themselves the benefit and positive impact of leaf-rib separator machine.
So, i aim to use my broom project to fund my leaf-rib separator project myself in the future.

Key advantages of our broom
Our broom is from oil palm rib but unlike others typical oil palm broom, our broom are MACHINED.
This result in stronger and more durable AND beautiful brooms.
The broom market actually do not have broom that can sweep garden or tough sweeping area. The corn broom is soft. It is good for indoor sweeping but not for tough sweeping area like garden or roadside. The plastic broom is not environmentally friendly and still do not have the quality from oil palm rib that is – elastic and tough.
In conclusion, the world still lacks of outdoor broom that works. Yes, coconut palm broom already exist in the market and have positive review about it but then again, they are not strong and durable. They are easily dismantled as slowly one by one the coconut rib get uprooted. This is common problem in any coconut broom product as they are made by hands while our broom are made by sets of machine.
In short, KestenBroom is a great product with great market value for someone that in search of unique broom product that works.
And furthermore, our broom and stick are two separate items that can be permanently attached later.This make cost savings for storage and shipping.
Other advantages of our broom product is:
1. The first and only machined palm broom in the world.
2. Non electrostatic.
3. Environmentally friendly.
4. Beautiful and unique design.
5. Most of all; Highly durable.


What we need
In order the broom project to succeed, we need fund to build more machines that make the broom, we also need a small factory to operate and to store oil palm rib that we bought.We also need some fund to register our company and product in marketplace such as Alibaba.
For it we at least need US 80,000 Dollar.
If the broom sells well oversea, we will use the money on leaf-rib separator machine project.And all positive impact that revolutionize food-meat industry that more healthy to eat and more humane can be realized.

<div>The Whiteaker Block Party has successfully created a 100% free and volunteer run event for the past 9 years.

</span></h3>
<p><i>Ta-ha-wus</i> is said to
mean Cloudsplitter, referring to Mt. Marcy, the highest mountain in the
Adirondacks.  To us that means reach
for the sky because there is no limit to creativity and learning.  And that’s also why we need your help.</p>
<p>Today the <a href=""http://www.rebeccakellyballet.com/Tahawus%20home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tahawus Center</a> is a place for ideas - with room to
move.  It emerged from a 104-year old building, the tallest in town, which had been neglected and was in boarded up condition when we, dance artists Craig Brashear and Rebecca Kelly, took it over through Appleby Foundation in
2010. </p>
<p>
 
 
Tahawus
demonstrates that a cultural center contributes in a healthy way to a
community.  Each year progress is made to reclaim and improve space within
the building to allow for new summer programs and activities to serve neighbors
and visitors with an array of educational and cultural adventures.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Preservation of this historic building is the green pathway that connects past and future – and the surrounding community!   Improvements (including 22 window replacements) have been made possible</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">entirely</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">with crowdfunding support.  </span></p>

invisible, “sealing the envelope” remains the vital key to restoring this

</blockquote><p></p></div>","Our Background

Ta-ha-wus is said to
mean Cloudsplitter, referring to Mt. Marcy, the highest mountain in the
Adirondacks.  To us that means reach
for the sky because there is no limit to creativity and learning.  And that’s also why we need your help.
Today the Tahawus Center is a place for ideas - with room to
move.  It emerged from a 104-year old building, the tallest in town, which had been neglected and was in boarded up condition when we, dance artists Craig Brashear and Rebecca Kelly, took it over through Appleby Foundation in
2010. 

 
 
Tahawus
demonstrates that a cultural center contributes in a healthy way to a
community.  Each year progress is made to reclaim and improve space within
the building to allow for new summer programs and activities to serve neighbors
and visitors with an array of educational and cultural adventures.  Preservation of this historic building is the green pathway that connects past and future – and the surrounding community!   Improvements (including 22 window replacements) have been made possible entirely with crowdfunding support.  



And because of  people like you,
Tahawus Center is now home to the Windows Gallery and the Cloudsplitter Dance Studio,  which has seen rehearsals for music-theater productions and dance groups including North Country Ballet Ensemble and Rebecca Kelly Ballet, and welcomed Adirondack Yoga  Adventures. Cloudsplitter Studio, with its permanent exhibit of dance photography by Todd Bissonette, keeps people active and engaged with summer swing dance workshops for adults, ballet classes for beginners, important symposia on climate change, women's issues, and more.   
The Gallery also serves as an important learning, meeting, and gathering place. Science Labs for youth (STEM) and Kids Co-Motion early childhood movement classes have continued since 2012.   Tahawus has hosted a Butterfly Talk, Music-in-the-Gallery events, and post-film chats accompanying the new Tahawus documentary film series.  

What We Need & What You Get

 


Insulation$5,000 is needed now for attic insulation and repairs.  Not so glamorous perhaps – and mostly
invisible, “sealing the envelope” remains the vital key to restoring this
historic building to make it accessible. 
 When
this is achieved, we can provide zoned heating on upper floors, which means they can be used
ALL YEAR ROUND.     The Impact 
Your support cycles directly back into the
local economy in creating a longer season to hold diverse art exhibits,
community gatherings, youth workshops, ongoing cultural and education
programming, and year-round yoga classes. 
The Tahawus Center spurs economic development on Main Street by adding attractions and activities for all ages.  Hospitality businesses, restaurants
and stores along Rt 9N and Main Street also benefit from increased traffic.   

Future Plans 2016
summer: 



In June, Tahawus continues the new Au Sable Forks documentary
film seriesin a partnership with its neighbor, the Hollywood Theater  
July
presents the annual STEM Science lab for youth 
Dance classes for all ages
including swing dance workshops for adults 
Weekly
yoga classes  
August introduces Tahawus' first Plein Air Workshop and exhibit, and
Cello / Fiddle workshop, ceilidh, and concert with Celtic and classical cellist, Abby Newton

With improved
insulation, the Tahawus activity period will extend into the late fall and early spring.

You can

by refreshments at Camp Clarion;  a
private tour of the Tahawus building for you and a guest, tickets
to a performance of Rebecca Kelly Ballet in NYC or in Lake Placid,  a series of yoga classes in Cloudsplitter Studio with Stefi Kearns, or just be
very cool carrying  an attractive and  convenient Tahawus carry bag anywhere.  Every single dollar raised goes toward the repair and insulation of the attic of this historic building, while improving its function in the
community. 





Each improvement milestone to date has come with a lot of elbow grease, determination, volunteers, and heartwarming contributions.  Some support has come from individuals not even located in the Adirondacks, but contributed because they want to support this effort, this vision, this community!  
Funding for infrastructure is very challenging to obtain.  It's mundane -- but it is the essential bricks and mortar of a much bigger vision.  Donations from local businesses and from individuals enable Tahawus to continue to make these critical renovations while maintaining its purpose every step of the way:  to strengthen community by providing access to - and participation in - the arts.

<p>We are three sewing mavens who want to share our passion of working with and creating things from fabric with our greater community. While our individual roads to CBM SEWing &amp; Design meandered in different ways, when we came together in our shared studio space just a few short months ago it was as if a giant lightbulb went off. Actually, it was more like a chandelier! Our ideas and goals aligned perfectly, and over Aver's cups of champagne CBM SEWing &amp; Design was born!</p>
<p>Carrie Burnett (<b>CB</b>) is a working mom of two who manages to run her own small boutique brand, BeriBee Designs, while also maintaining many ties in the community.</p>
<p>Maggie Selo (<b>MS</b>) is based in Lafayette but ventures down to Bloomington part-time since retiring from Purdue. She is the Mags half of the mother-daughter team that is Bets &amp; Mags, a small label maker of children's toys and baby accessories.</p>

<h1>WHAT WE HOPE TO BE</h1>
<p>CBM SEWing &amp; Design will be open for classes, events, and open stitch hours that are posted in advance. More than that though, we hope to become the place you think of when you want to sew or even just talk about sewing. We want to establish a warm, welcoming space where you can come and be creative, where you can come and learn new things, where you can come and meet other people who share the same passion! While we'd like to eventually expand to carrying fabric and notions, our main focus at this time is to establish a space for community sewing so we won't be a retail shop at this time.</p>
<h1>HOW YOU CAN HELP!</h1>
<p>In order to fully stock our space with machines and supplies, we need funds! Here's what we hope to obtain:</p>
<p><b>Sewing Machines ($1,000-1,600)</b>: We want to make sewing accessible to everyone, even if you can't or don't want to spend the money on your own machine. We will be purchasing 4 to 6 standard sewing machines for use in classes or rental during open sewing times. These will be machines that are readily available and affordable for even the casual sewer - there's no point in falling in love with a machine that you'll never be able to have in your own home!</p>
<p><b>Tables and Chairs ($1,000)</b>: We have a lovely but very empty 200 sq ft space that's perfect for classes and Sip and Stitch evenings! Sadly, right now we're using a variety of folding tables and chairs that are far from ideal for sewing comfortably. We would like to put in sturdy tables and chairs that will accommodate everyone who comes in to the space.<br/></p>
<p><b>Rotary Cutters &amp; Scissors ($400)</b>: While we already have a great table setup for cutting, we are in need of various cutting utensils for use during classes. </p>
<p><b>Various Small Notions ($100)</b>: It seems like there are always lots of little items that we need when we are sewing: pins, pin grabbers, machine needles, rotary cutter blades, snips, pressing cloths, soft measuring tapes, and many other handy notions. Oh, and bobbins! Because some of us seem to go through those like they're going out of style, but we're not going to name any names....</p>
<h1>WHAT IF YOU REALLY, REALLY LOVE US?</h1>
<p>Are you wondering what happens if we appeal to lots and lots of you and we end up with more funds than we're initially requesting? Not to worry, we have dream goals that we will then be able to fulfill, meaning that we'll get to offer even more exciting options in classes and workshops. For instance:</p>
<p><b>Sergers &amp; Serger Thread ($1,400)</b>: While they're definitely not required for sewing with knits (think t-shirts), they are preferred! We would absolutely love to have 4 basic level sergers (and the appropriate threads) available for classes and rental to help you learn what the heck a serger is and how to use one. Carrie and Elizabeth use their sergers regularly and have picked up many tips and tricks along the way - we want to share our knowledge!</p>
<p><b>Snap Press ($100)</b>: From baby clothes and bibs to pouches to interesting replacements for zippers - snaps can be used in so many different projects! We would love to be able to have a heavy duty, high quality press available for classes and workshops to make it a happy experience for all (and if you've used some of the alternatives, you know already that they can be extremely frustrating!).</p>
<p><b>Irons &amp; Extra Board ($600)</b>: We already have a nice ironing table available for use, but our current iron may not be able to handle the amount of use we're anticipating. Unfortunately, nice quality irons come with a nice hefty price tag. We would love to have 1 or 2 of these beauties on hand, along with a second ironing board that we can pop up when needed. It would be great to also obtain some of specialty pressing pieces like tailor's hams or seam rolls.</p>
<p><b>Steam</b> <b>Press ($300)</b>: Some of the workshops we hope to offer will involve fusible interfacing, and the one of the best ways to do use this important item is with a steam press. It also can be used for heat-press vinyl (picture cool t-shirts you design yourself!), and we'd love to offer classes showing you how to use this really great tool.</p>
<p>We'd also love to be able to purchase a loveseat, coat closet, and other items to make the space more comfortable for everyone who comes to share our space - we want to create a place where we ALL love to spend time! </p>
<p></p>
<h1>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h1>
<p>Our greatest challenge for this sewing studio will be generating interest to fill our classes on a continuing basis. We have seen so much interest in sewing lessons the past few years from family, friends, and community members, but we will need to work hard to help that enthusiasm transfer to real commitment. We intend to heavily advertise on social media as well as local media outlets. We will offer a continually changing schedule of classes and workshops which should also help with student retention.</p>
<br/><p>We would be truly honored to have your help and support in establishing an open community of people who share our passion!</p><p><i>Please note that if you would like to receive a perk, you must choose it from the right side of this page before proceeding with any contribution.

When we do events we are blessed to bring our crystal friends, which we bring in thru many wonderful crystal and mineral distributors, usually small family businesses that specialize in highest quality and well-intended wonderful people.  This enriches our hearts and all who they go to. Joining the Angelic realms with the mineral kingdom is 35 years of life's work and what a wonderful wonderful job it is.  
Immense GRATITUDE for your support to see this dream come true. Looking forward to pouring candles for you. Much love from Ayesha and all of us at Angel Radiance where ""friends become clients and clients become friends.""For sales and inquiries call 615-385-1966 or email angelradiancesales@gmail.com.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

The project was conceived during a three-week artist residency in September 2013 at the Abrahamian Arts Centre in Yerevan, Armenia. Since its inception, Dear Armen has morphed from staged reading to interdisciplinary production featuring two distinct versions and five incarnations, which have toured throughout Canada, USA, and Armenia. Out of our work with Dear Armen has a grown a creative partnership, vision, and mission that is becoming Kalik.</span></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising startup money for Kalik!</p>
<p>We are actively seeking ways to make Kalik, as an entity, become sustainable. This means being able to fund all phases of our projects. It means being able to adequately compensate artists for their time and labour. It means being able to make a living wage, i.e. a wage that can cover the basics costs to live. And ultimately, it means funding towards the creation of works that can become the brilliant creations they are meant to be.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Your contributions to this fundraiser will go directly to our startup costs, including our initial operations expenses, time, labour, rental/purchase of equipment, communications costs, travel, as well as providing a base of support as we apply for and secure further funding. </span></p>

<p><span>Living as we do, in and between Canada and the US, we continue wrestling with capitalism as we explore our funding possibilities. We are actively searching for funding models that are ethical and in line with our politics. We do not have easy or clear solutions, but we are committed to asking hard questions towards answers. Currently, our funding model integrates live events and shows with ticket sales, workshops and educational programming, grants, sponsorship, fundraising and the sale of original art &amp; merchandise.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We are a blend of creative and practical-­make­-it­-happen-­despite-­the-­odds. We are currently operating on very small budgets, and stretching these to make the absolute most and the best we can.</span></p>

We arrive at artmaking as generative and transformative mediums for expressing urgent truths, recalling ancestral stories and teachings, while simultaneously visioning future worlds that centre healing, justice, and love. Through Kalik we will create and produce original and participatory interdisciplinary art, performances, films, digital media, literature, events, gatherings and workshops, working with and alongside many artists, creatives, and advocates for the kinds of worlds and communities we know are possible and that we are actively building. 

Kalik has grown from the need to:


disrupt the (inequity, fuckery, and brutality of the) systems we live in
reclaim our cultural knowings and practices
celebrate our queer and gender-fabulousness
create great art that represents the experiences of those of us typically underrepresented or not at all represented in dominant media

We are called urgently to this work and know that it needs to sit centre.  In launching Kalik and this fundraiser, we are saying that our stories, our communities, our survival, our resilience, and our visions for the future, are vital and significant. We are setting the intention that this work is fundable, and we can do this.

Kalik comes from the collaborative partnership between Kamee Abrahamian and lee williams boudakian. We are interdisciplinary artists, producers, and facilitators. We first came together to create Dear Armen. The project was conceived during a three-week artist residency in September 2013 at the Abrahamian Arts Centre in Yerevan, Armenia. Since its inception, Dear Armen has morphed from staged reading to interdisciplinary production featuring two distinct versions and five incarnations, which have toured throughout Canada, USA, and Armenia. Out of our work with Dear Armen has a grown a creative partnership, vision, and mission that is becoming Kalik.

What We Need & What You Get
We are raising startup money for Kalik!
We are actively seeking ways to make Kalik, as an entity, become sustainable. This means being able to fund all phases of our projects. It means being able to adequately compensate artists for their time and labour. It means being able to make a living wage, i.e. a wage that can cover the basics costs to live. And ultimately, it means funding towards the creation of works that can become the brilliant creations they are meant to be.
Your contributions to this fundraiser will go directly to our startup costs, including our initial operations expenses, time, labour, rental/purchase of equipment, communications costs, travel, as well as providing a base of support as we apply for and secure further funding. 
A glimpse into the projects we are working on:


Dear Armen (theatre incarnation, performance-installation incarnation)
World of Q (film)
Workshops & Curriculum development (ancestral storytelling, diasporic futures)
Boxes (theatre)
Kindred Analogues (documentary, transmedia)



As a contributor, you will get awesome perks including original art and limited edition merchandise, tickets to our shows, a spot in one of our workshops, producer credits, visibility for your own work through cross-promotion and opportunities for collaboration. 
Working collaboratively and within community is a high priority for our work, not only to execute the best possible art, but also politically to be building community and connecting with folks to create meaningful engagement and dialogue. We see Kalik as a platform that will engage artists and creative people at all stages of the learning/making process. 
We are looking to create dynamic projects with you.


The Details

Living as we do, in and between Canada and the US, we continue wrestling with capitalism as we explore our funding possibilities. We are actively searching for funding models that are ethical and in line with our politics. We do not have easy or clear solutions, but we are committed to asking hard questions towards answers. Currently, our funding model integrates live events and shows with ticket sales, workshops and educational programming, grants, sponsorship, fundraising and the sale of original art & merchandise.
We are a blend of creative and practical-­make­-it­-happen-­despite-­the-­odds. We are currently operating on very small budgets, and stretching these to make the absolute most and the best we can.
We have many ideas, and are excited to keep building.




Your Support Has Impact 


We have tiered donations/perks so that all levels of donations come with something awesome. And/but, It is possible to donate to this campaign outside of the listed perks. People are welcome/invited to donate any amount they can/are able, and we are grateful for each and every supporter.

<div>HISTORY:</div>
<div>
<p>Hello Everyone!  My name is Sheila Barsness and I am disabled. I suffer from Bipolar disorder and PTSD. I am currently stuck in the welfare system known as SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance). Every month more than 14 MILLION people receive disability benefits from the United States Government.  I was so relieved when I was awarded disability benefits because I would be able to take care of my family since I was literally unfit to work for other businesses. </p>
<p>In 2011 with the help of a friend I started the business Community Funding Solutions, LLC, a grant writing company that specializes in helping small nonprofits and start-up businesses get grants and small business loans for their projects. I have been writing grants and helping people achieve their dreams since 2002. Before the non-profit world I spent 12 years working in the Art/Craft Industry as a store manager. </p>
<p>In 2015, I did something stupid. I went off of my medication because I wanted to fit in and be ""normal"" like everyone else.  Some people should just not be off of their medications (I am one of them).  Short story is, I ended up opening a store when I was manic and changing the name and adding to the focus of my business. It is now Art With A Purpose Co-op, a multi-shareholder cooperative for small business start-ups, nonprofits, and socially challenged individuals like myself. We put a special emphasis on creativity, community and working to educate and build social reform of the current government systems for people with mental health disabilities. I have 2 co-partners each one of them suffers from PTSD or Depression  and we all have a hard time conforming to a ""normal"" job.  </p>
<p>On SSDI I am able to earn up to $800 per month and keep my benefits. If I make $801 I lose my insurance and cash benefits.  The problem is that I can't support my youngest child on $801 or pay for my meds, my nurse and my bi-weekly psych visits and doctor appointments, my rent payment, and all of the bills associated with life.  </p>
<p>Why should you care?  You should care because I have a way of saving taxpayers more than $25 billion dollars per year, improving the economy by taking people who are barely scraping by because they are stuck in a system that does not work and find creative ways off of the system and give them the ability to afford things that they currently can not afford like a car, house repairs/house or the ability to create their version of the American dream.  </p>
<p>I want off of the welfare system as do millions of Americans in my situation. We went on the system thinking that it would be temporary only until we find the proper medication or treatment and to find out that in order for us to get off of the welfare system and be self-sufficient we would have to make in excess of $5,800 per month to live in the same poverty that we live in now having to make less than $800 per month.  The government gives me and my son approximately $1800 per month plus our health care and medication costs of approximately $3,200 dollars per month. This means that the government currently gives me approximately $5,000 per month. The current system is that if you go over your $800 you lose your benefits.  If people lose their insurance that means that they stop taking their medication and going to therapy and become a detriment to themselves and others.  </p>
<p>OUR CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>Our Campaign is to raise $51,000. Your investment will give 50 people the ability to apply creative self-help programs that reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>It will allow those 50 people to learn new skills that they will be able to use to generate an additional income, become employed or even self employed, through help from our business incubator.  </p>
<p>In addition it will generate conversation of millions of people throughout the state about the despair of the current system. It will lead to awareness and change of the system through the development of a working model, that you can say you helped to build.</p>
<p>$30,000 will provide 1 year of weekly art/craft/sewing scholarships to people with mental &amp; emotional issues that would like to reduce the effects of the symptoms through creative outlets. This will provide 50 people with 52 classes.  The $30,000 covers the cost of the workshop space and material costs.  The instructors for the weekly classes have volunteered their time for 1 year.</p>
<p>$11,000 will be used for educating and empowering people with disabilities to develop skills and become financially sound. The funding will cover the costs of hosting a regional event in the Twin Cities or St. Cloud area that will introduce creativity for mental wellness strategies and social skills and will start the conversation between mental health providers, lawmakers and the people who have mental and physical disabilities to develop a strategy and support for a ""scaled"" Social Security Disability/Welfare system.</p>
<p>$10,000 will be used to develop a working model for social/welfare system reform. The funding will cover the actual costs of making changes to the system. It will cost more than that, but we have a lot of people who are willing to donate their time and services to make this work. </p>

We are there because of the glitches in the current system that keep us stuck there. We may be unable to work at a ""normal"" job but through creativity we can find our place in the community and contribute. It doesn't mean that we are unable or unwilling to work, we just stand to lose too much the way the system is now.  </p>

The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:
Our project doesn't just benefit the 50 people who receive the training and self-help therapy. It benefits their families, the communities that they live in and the state's economy. It will change million of people's perception of disabled vs. lazy! Most people on welfare or the social security disability system don't want to be there. We are there because of the glitches in the current system that keep us stuck there. We may be unable to work at a ""normal"" job but through creativity we can find our place in the community and contribute. It doesn't mean that we are unable or unwilling to work, we just stand to lose too much the way the system is now.  
You have the ability to help millions of Americans help themselves out of poverty and the disability/welfare system.  You have the ability to work with us and our team to change the system for 14 million people. Please accept our call of action and invest in creative reform. It doesn't matter if you only have $1 to invest or $50,000 to invest. It is the long game that we are after and we want and need you to be part of our team, regardless of the size of your investment!
TRACK RECORD OF THE TEAM:
* 14 years of experience building small businesses
* 14 years of grant writing experience
* 1 successful state bill and 1 federal bill 
* 52+ work years of creative problem solving and system design
* 26 years of management experience

Risks & Challenges
We have created national scale models before and the biggest challenge is that some people hate change. Education is key and the more people that we can educate the more people will want the change.
To educate people we are going to set up a blog on our website and post weekly YouTube updates so that the information is easily accessible. Every week we will answer questions that we receive so that you can help spread the word!
Other Ways You Can Help
 If you can't afford to invest in the program there are other ways that you can help. If you live close to Alexandria, MN we would love to have you as a volunteer in the Art Safari, or donate art/craft/sewing supplies so that we can keep our costs low for EVERYONE who comes to the Art Safari. If you belong to an organization, please invite us to speak to your members about Art With A Purpose and the Art Safari.
If you are unable to travel to the Art Safari or Art With A Purpose you can still help. Here is how:
* Share our crowdfunding campaign and mission with your family and friends.

On the weekend of the 7th-10th we were in Houston, Texas for a large convention. One of the largest we had the ability to sell at. We had a pretty good weekend, and were on our way out of town when we stopped to eat. During our 45 minutes eating, our van was broken into, and stolen right out of the parking lot. The van in addition to being our business vehicle, had contained inside of it all of our unsold liscenced merchandise stock, the tools in which we make our crafting items, our personal items including clothing. In addition all of our cash transactions for the weekend were inside the van as well, so all but a small percentage of our profits from the weekend were lost. That van was our business, two and a half years worth of starting from a handful of perler designs a box of glasses and twelve buttons designs and working to build it into a self sustaining business with thousands of dollars invested in liscened merchandise, crafting items, setup, and the van. We are utterly devestated. We have a desire to start over, but little in the way of funds to do so. We do not make a habit of asking for money, but we are caught in a difficult spot, and it has required us to look for a different means to get the funds needed to begin the process over again.

<p>To us, an Eco Lodge is based on ecological values and is in itself a closed ecosystem: using biodegradable and recyclable materials, cleaning and recycling waste water, harvesting rain water, generating its own energy and leaving minimal changes in the surrounding landscape. </p>
<p>Ahanta Eco Lodge is the <strong>first rammed earth house </strong>in coastal Ghana, and <strong>the only Surf Camp</strong> on the African continent founded <strong>100 % on ecological principles</strong> both in its construction and management ethics.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Goal #1: Improved local economy in Busua</strong></p>
<p><i>Objectives: </i></p>
<p><strong>a</strong>. Attract more tourism to Busua to generate income for local businesses<br/><strong>b</strong>. Create meaningful and sustainable jobs at the Surf Camp<br/><strong>c</strong>. Offer training and professional development to employees</p>
<p><i>Actions: </i></p>
<p><b>-</b> Finish the construction of the house and have the Surf Camp fully running by the end of 2017<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Goal #2 Improved environmental conditions in Busua</strong></p>
<p><i>Objectives:</i></p>
<p><strong>a</strong>. To have a clean beach for locals and tourists to enjoy<br/><strong>b</strong>. Prevent destruction of ecosystems for financial gains</p>
<p><i>Actions:</i></p>
<p><strong>a</strong>. Collect plastic waste from the beach and send it for recycling<br/><strong>b</strong>. Start a turtle conservation program together with Surf &amp; Impact NGO and local fishermen<br/><strong>c</strong>. Encourage environmental awareness and action at community meetings<br/><strong>d</strong>. Organize workshops for children in Busua primary and secondary school on environmental protection and the importance of healthy ecosystems</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why crowdfunding</h3>
<p>Because we want to keep our freedom to re-direct a part of the profits from the business to projects that benefit Busua community. Our priority is environmental and social sustainability rather than quick profits, something that doesn't match well with conventional ways of financial investment.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>In order to open the Surf Camp and kick off our environmental projects we need to finish the house. So far, we have worked hard to put all our available funds into the house construction, but being young people still trying to make it in this world, we have realized that we need help to finish. This fundraising will give us the opportunity to keep the construction at full speed, and we will continue to dedicate 110% of our time and efforts to this project. We hope to complete the Eco Lodge and to open the doors to our first guests by the end of 2017.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is the first rammed earth eco-house we have built so that is new to us. Luckily we have good advisors in the people that helped us in the first stages of the project and a team of experienced workers in Ghana to seek advise from should any issue arise. Julia has a solid education in environmental management from London and Ghana and knows most of the dos and don'ts of a project like this.</p>
<p>Secondly, we are not looking to impose any measures in the community which the people themselves do not want. We will do our best to be a good example by running an ethical business and embracing environmentally friendly practices, but there is no guarantee that other people will do the same. However, we have great support in the locally run Surf &amp; Impact NGO who will join us in the projects we undertake. We promise to involve the community in anything we do that will affect them and we will keep the door open to other suggestions than the ones we have envisioned.</p>
<p>We believe that Ghana has great unfulfilled potential for eco-tourism. Recognizing that the Western African region has had its challenges in recent years, we are nevertheless optimistic that the best days are yet to come.</p>

To get by, would you commit a crime? Former inmates are faced with these questions far too often. Ex-offenders confront one pressing re-entry challenge after another, everything from finding a place to live and arranging drug abuse treatment to getting a job. A setback in any one of these areas can easily lead to relapse and a return to prison, what public policy analysts call ""recidivism.""</p><p>A Bureau of Justice statistic study finds that inmates released from state prisons have a five-year recidivism rate of 76.6% and federal prisoners released have a 44.7% re-arrest rate after five years.</p><p>In the spring of 2015, I purchased my first beehive at the convincing of a friend who felt we needed to do our part and to educate others about the importance of honeybees, which were decreasing at an alarming rate.  In the summer of 2015, I began teaching an entrepreneurship class at a women’s prison.  My thought was that entrepreneurship was a viable option for individuals facing difficulty in finding employment. I am a Family and Consumer Sciences Educator for  University of Maryland Extension. </p><p>I mentioned my new venture to one of the students in my class.  She told me that they wanted hives at the prison and  the warden was on board.  She also told me about a company in Chicago selling products made from the bee’s honey and wax.  Additionally, they were hiring ex-offenders to work in the company, providing them with training, marketable skills and transitional employment.</p><p>I thought this was a novel idea, and thus the concept for BeeHavin’ was born in that classroom.  The name is a pun.  Our employees, the formerly incarcerated are no longer misbehaving – and our apiaries are havens for our honeybees.</p><p><strong>A Sustainable Solution to Recidivism</strong></p><p>Employment represents one of the greatest barriers to an individual’s successful reintegration into the community.   On average only one in five prisoners have employment lined up prior to their release.  The reasons for lack of employment are manifold.  Some individuals do not possess proper skills, work experience, or education to secure employment.  Others have erratic work histories, mental impairments or life skill deficits.  The ones that are qualified to work, simply do not have the proper identification or credentials to demonstrate eligibility; do not know how or where to look for jobs and must meet parole requirements that limit their ability to find and keep employment.</p><p>Sustainable employment may be our single best opportunity to significantly reduce recidivism.  In 2015, the Manhattan Institute released a study that revealed a 20% reduction in recidivism of non-violent offenders that could obtain employment.  This study also revealed that the sooner employment was obtained, the less likely they were to commit further crimes. </p><p>Beehavin’ breaks down employment barriers by hiring returning citizens and helping them acquire work experience, marketable skills and credentials through employment.  At its most basic level, employment provides former prisoners with a consistent source of funding for necessities and basic amenities.  It also increases self-efficacy and self-sufficiency, while building confidence that one can support oneself without need to resort to criminal activities or reliance on friends, family or handouts.</p><p>Employees earn a living wage with benefits.  They acquire concrete skills such as inventorying products, sales, customer service, and production that can be transferred to a variety of industries.   </p><p>They learn sound financial management and are encouraged to participate in company sponsored workshops on budgeting, buying a home, entrepreneurship and asset building.  While we cannot provide for their every need, we will have a human resources/case manager who will refer employees to other organizations in the community for additional assistance to help increase their chances for successful reintegration.</p><p><strong>The Product</strong></p><p>BeeHavin’ produces all-natural lip and skin care lines that are powered by honeybees and our amazing employees and beekeepers.  The first product we will introduce is our lip balm which is made of three ingredients: avocado oil, a natural sun block and skin moisturizer; beeswax, which is anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and an antioxidant; and an essential oil for flavoring, such as peppermint, orange ginger or lemon.</p><p>We will use the funds raised in the campaign to purchase a commercial printer so that we can make custom labels for our products; to hire three employees and to purchase hives, equipment  and bees for our apiary.</p><p><strong>Unique Perks</strong></p><p>Our unique perks were designed by individuals who are currently incarcerated.  We held a contest that was promoted in State, Federal and Local correctional institutions across the country.  Inmates submitted entries for our perk designs. The winning entry came from a graphics design class currently taught by Thomas Lane of Graphics Needed, <a href=""http://www.graphicsneeded.webs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.graphicsneeded.webs.com</a>. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491003464/cp962woggfvwbeev1tof.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>The prison cycle takes a toll on everyone, including the communities where people cycle in and out of jail.  Some communities, like Sandtown-Winchester in Baltimore have a higher than average percentage of their residents incarcerated in state presents at an annual cost of $37,000 per person.  Maryland’s state budget allocates $17 million each year to this impoverished neighborhood, not for job training, family services or education, but solely for incarceration.  For BeeHavin’ there exists a real opportunity to disrupt the continuous cycle of quarantining humans-----through sustainable employment.  For the sake of society at large, it may represent our best opportunity to significantly disrupt recidivism and  growing population of Americans with criminal records.</p><p>According to the American Civil Liberties Union, America, land of the free, has earned the disturbing distinction of being the world’s leading jailer.  Although the U.S. represents just 5% of the world’s population, it holds 25% of its inmates. The U.S. spends over $80 billion on incarceration each year.  Local, state, and federal governments spend anywhere from $20,000 to $50,000 annually to keep an individual behind bars.  Studies say that states spend almost four times per capita on incarcerating prisoners than educating students.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><ul>
<li>Establishing our company and setting our products apart from our competitors could be a challenge.   To overcome this challenge, we have chosen a different business model from our retail competitors.  Although, our product will be available in natural food markets and on our website, our product will also be available wholesale to businesses for customized branding.  Additionally, we will pursue state and federal contracting opportunities, as well as nonprofit partnering opportunities.</li>
<li>Overcoming the stigma of hiring the formerly incarcerated could pose a challenge. Too often society negatively label persons with criminal records, often citing that they got what they deserved.  We plan to overcome stigma associated with incarceration through education.  Ex-offender reentry happens every day.  Many emerge from prison without much more than the clothes they are wearing and their criminal records.  We all have the opportunity to either help empower them to become positive, contributing citizens of society or to reoffend and commit new offenses that also jeopardize our safety and well-being as a community.</li>

I am a Family and Consumer Sciences Educator for  University of Maryland Extension. I mentioned my new venture to one of the students in my class.  She told me that they wanted hives at the prison and  the warden was on board.  She also told me about a company in Chicago selling products made from the bee’s honey and wax.  Additionally, they were hiring ex-offenders to work in the company, providing them with training, marketable skills and transitional employment.I thought this was a novel idea, and thus the concept for BeeHavin’ was born in that classroom.  The name is a pun.  Our employees, the formerly incarcerated are no longer misbehaving – and our apiaries are havens for our honeybees.A Sustainable Solution to RecidivismEmployment represents one of the greatest barriers to an individual’s successful reintegration into the community.   On average only one in five prisoners have employment lined up prior to their release.  The reasons for lack of employment are manifold.  Some individuals do not possess proper skills, work experience, or education to secure employment.  Others have erratic work histories, mental impairments or life skill deficits.  The ones that are qualified to work, simply do not have the proper identification or credentials to demonstrate eligibility; do not know how or where to look for jobs and must meet parole requirements that limit their ability to find and keep employment.Sustainable employment may be our single best opportunity to significantly reduce recidivism.  In 2015, the Manhattan Institute released a study that revealed a 20% reduction in recidivism of non-violent offenders that could obtain employment.  This study also revealed that the sooner employment was obtained, the less likely they were to commit further crimes. Beehavin’ breaks down employment barriers by hiring returning citizens and helping them acquire work experience, marketable skills and credentials through employment.  At its most basic level, employment provides former prisoners with a consistent source of funding for necessities and basic amenities.  It also increases self-efficacy and self-sufficiency, while building confidence that one can support oneself without need to resort to criminal activities or reliance on friends, family or handouts.Employees earn a living wage with benefits.  They acquire concrete skills such as inventorying products, sales, customer service, and production that can be transferred to a variety of industries.   They learn sound financial management and are encouraged to participate in company sponsored workshops on budgeting, buying a home, entrepreneurship and asset building.  While we cannot provide for their every need, we will have a human resources/case manager who will refer employees to other organizations in the community for additional assistance to help increase their chances for successful reintegration.The ProductBeeHavin’ produces all-natural lip and skin care lines that are powered by honeybees and our amazing employees and beekeepers.  The first product we will introduce is our lip balm which is made of three ingredients: avocado oil, a natural sun block and skin moisturizer; beeswax, which is anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and an antioxidant; and an essential oil for flavoring, such as peppermint, orange ginger or lemon.We will use the funds raised in the campaign to purchase a commercial printer so that we can make custom labels for our products; to hire three employees and to purchase hives, equipment  and bees for our apiary.Unique PerksOur unique perks were designed by individuals who are currently incarcerated.  We held a contest that was promoted in State, Federal and Local correctional institutions across the country.  Inmates submitted entries for our perk designs. The winning entry came from a graphics design class currently taught by Thomas Lane of Graphics Needed, www.graphicsneeded.webs.com. The ImpactThe prison cycle takes a toll on everyone, including the communities where people cycle in and out of jail.  Some communities, like Sandtown-Winchester in Baltimore have a higher than average percentage of their residents incarcerated in state presents at an annual cost of $37,000 per person.  Maryland’s state budget allocates $17 million each year to this impoverished neighborhood, not for job training, family services or education, but solely for incarceration.  For BeeHavin’ there exists a real opportunity to disrupt the continuous cycle of quarantining humans-----through sustainable employment.  For the sake of society at large, it may represent our best opportunity to significantly disrupt recidivism and  growing population of Americans with criminal records.According to the American Civil Liberties Union, America, land of the free, has earned the disturbing distinction of being the world’s leading jailer.  Although the U.S. represents just 5% of the world’s population, it holds 25% of its inmates. The U.S. spends over $80 billion on incarceration each year.  Local, state, and federal governments spend anywhere from $20,000 to $50,000 annually to keep an individual behind bars.  Studies say that states spend almost four times per capita on incarcerating prisoners than educating students.Risks & Challenges
Establishing our company and setting our products apart from our competitors could be a challenge.   To overcome this challenge, we have chosen a different business model from our retail competitors.  Although, our product will be available in natural food markets and on our website, our product will also be available wholesale to businesses for customized branding.  Additionally, we will pursue state and federal contracting opportunities, as well as nonprofit partnering opportunities.
Overcoming the stigma of hiring the formerly incarcerated could pose a challenge. Too often society negatively label persons with criminal records, often citing that they got what they deserved.  We plan to overcome stigma associated with incarceration through education.  Ex-offender reentry happens every day.  Many emerge from prison without much more than the clothes they are wearing and their criminal records.  We all have the opportunity to either help empower them to become positive, contributing citizens of society or to reoffend and commit new offenses that also jeopardize our safety and well-being as a community.
Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand not everyone can contribute monetarily, but you can still help us spread the word about our company, our mission, and our products!  And, you can use the share tools on this page to help you do that. Also, you can support us by purchasing our product either from our website at www.beehavinproducts.com or through one of our Retail Partners which will be listed on our website.Thank you for your consideration of the support of this campaign!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Why A Bakery?</h3>
<p>For as long as I've been alive, our father has been baking a Vanilla Wafer Cake. He basically takes some vanilla wafer cookies, mixes them with raisins, shredded coconut, pecans and dried cranberries, throws it in the oven and a few hours later, there's a delectable dessert sitting on the kitchen counter. My brother and I would giggle uncontrollably as our father would use a rolling pin to smash vanilla wafers until it looked like flour. Of course, our mother wasn't too fond of it, but we loved it. We also loved licking the batter off the mixing beaters. As the years have passed, the equipment has changed - food processors have replaced rolling pins and stand mixers have replaced hand mixers - but the fantastic taste has remained the same. </p>

<div>
<h3>Ok, I'm In, But Why Do You Need The Money?</h3>
<p>Our bakery is strictly online. There is no physical store, but we need an industrial kitchen to bake our cakes. Baking our cakes costs by the hour, so we need initial funds to help get us off the ground. This kickstarter allows us to get those funds and reward YOU with perks such as free cakes, tote bags and mugs for helping us without mortgaging our future with debt. Beyond access to an industrial kitchen, we need to wholesale the ingredients of our baked goods, and this will allow us to order those initial goods early and get us off the ground.

Why A Bakery?
For as long as I've been alive, our father has been baking a Vanilla Wafer Cake. He basically takes some vanilla wafer cookies, mixes them with raisins, shredded coconut, pecans and dried cranberries, throws it in the oven and a few hours later, there's a delectable dessert sitting on the kitchen counter. My brother and I would giggle uncontrollably as our father would use a rolling pin to smash vanilla wafers until it looked like flour. Of course, our mother wasn't too fond of it, but we loved it. We also loved licking the batter off the mixing beaters. As the years have passed, the equipment has changed - food processors have replaced rolling pins and stand mixers have replaced hand mixers - but the fantastic taste has remained the same. 

Our Standard Vanilla Wafer Cake Includes Raisins, Shredded Coconut, Dried Cranberries and Pecans.

We Use No Flour, But Real Vanilla Wafer Cookies In All Of Our Vanilla Wafer Cakes.

You Should Love Your Dessert, So We Made Our Vanilla Wafer Cakes Completely Customizable. Request an ingredient be added or taken away. 

Ok, I'm In, But Why Do You Need The Money?
Our bakery is strictly online. There is no physical store, but we need an industrial kitchen to bake our cakes. Baking our cakes costs by the hour, so we need initial funds to help get us off the ground. This kickstarter allows us to get those funds and reward YOU with perks such as free cakes, tote bags and mugs for helping us without mortgaging our future with debt. Beyond access to an industrial kitchen, we need to wholesale the ingredients of our baked goods, and this will allow us to order those initial goods early and get us off the ground. If our campaign is not fully funded in the 30 days, any donations made will go towards everything mentioned above. 
Wait, There's One More Thing...

<h3>Why Patria Coffee?</h3>
<p>Patria Coffee began as a solution to the work-family balance; we converted our garage to a coffee workshop and to roast coffee and sell online. Now it's time to realize the vision of creating community-minded space.  </p>
<p>We live and work here in the City of Compton.  As of now there is not an independent Coffeehouse in the city.  This is not because residents don't want one; currently our neighbors leave the city to catch up with a friend, work, or study.  While there are a couple of big chain coffeehouses, there are few local alternatives for those who want ethically sourced, sustainably  produced, organic options.  In addition to creating a place to grab a cup of coffee or a snack, we want to amplify community enrichment already happening, like poetry and art nights or panels to discuss relevant issues, all while staffing with a local workforce that is paid a dignified wage.  </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>If you help us reach our funding goal, <i><strong>we will be able to open our doors <u>debt free</u>, which will lead to the ability to hire local employees sooner and expand our opening hours.  </strong></i></p>
<p>Funding of the campaign will also support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architectural and other professional services</li>
<li>New Drain Vent Sewage system up to code</li>
<li>New Electrical system up to code</li>
<li>New Heating system up to code</li>
<li>Title 24 Compliance (State energy efficient requirements)</li>
<li>Building Permits</li>
<li>Equipment</li>
<li>Job Training</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While it may be our names on this campaign, our doors will never open without the committed support of many people.  Even if you are not able to contribute financially, please use your influence to share this campaign with your family and friends.  Our funding goal is attainable if as many people as possible give whatever amount they are able.  </p>
</div><p> </p></div>","Why Patria Coffee?
Patria Coffee began as a solution to the work-family balance; we converted our garage to a coffee workshop and to roast coffee and sell online. Now it's time to realize the vision of creating community-minded space.  
We live and work here in the City of Compton.  As of now there is not an independent Coffeehouse in the city.  This is not because residents don't want one; currently our neighbors leave the city to catch up with a friend, work, or study.  While there are a couple of big chain coffeehouses, there are few local alternatives for those who want ethically sourced, sustainably  produced, organic options.  In addition to creating a place to grab a cup of coffee or a snack, we want to amplify community enrichment already happening, like poetry and art nights or panels to discuss relevant issues, all while staffing with a local workforce that is paid a dignified wage.  
What We Need & What You Get
If you help us reach our funding goal, we will be able to open our doors debt free, which will lead to the ability to hire local employees sooner and expand our opening hours.  
Funding of the campaign will also support:

Architectural and other professional services
New Drain Vent Sewage system up to code
New Electrical system up to code
New Heating system up to code
Title 24 Compliance (State energy efficient requirements)
Building Permits
Equipment
Job Training


The Impact
Prioritizing both our local community and the communities of growers that source our coffee is important to us, and that is true for the process of opening this coffee house as well.  For example, the work on the space will be completed by a contractor who gives employment opportunities to folks who may typically be shut out of the labor market for a variety of reasons.  Before we open our doors, and after, our guiding value is ""in the City, for the City.""  
Our efforts to open a community-conscious small business do not exist in isolation; there is already a groundswell of local businesses that believe that it is in their best interest to prioritize their neighbors and that running a successful business does not just mean maximizing profits.

<p><strong>Hello Everyone,</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for visiting our IndieGoGo<sup>TM</sup> page for SIDO (Sustainable Increasing and Decreasing Ownership) System powered by SidoSoft (SaaS technology). Dubbem Global has teamed up with the great people at IndieGoGo<sup>TM</sup> to raise funding for a software system that manage the ownership of revenue-producing assets participating in SIDO scheme. Please make a pledge; contribute by purchasing one or more vouchers and receive awesome rewards including codified notes (certificates) for all future references.</p>
<p><strong>1.0 What about SIDO System?</strong></p>
<p>SIDO system is an innovative strategy facilitating the gradual movement of creative ownership of revenue-producing assets from revenue investors to investees to employees/customers and occasionally from customers back to investees (asset managers). In general, SIDO scheme is based on the concept of sustainable, simultaneous increasing and decreasing ownership system powered by SidoSoft (cloud-based, SaaS technology solution) and driven by financial innovations. SIDO system is about leveraging technology, innovation, and strategy to disrupt traditional approach to ownership of assets.  SIDO scheme is about how time, technology, creativity, innovation, strategy, entrepreneurship, and relationships combine together to transform conventional ownership models.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Why SIDO System? - Problems Solved through SIDO Schemes</strong></p>
<p>Around the world, impact-driven investors want to enter and exit from profitable investment opportunities but deeply concerned about the associated risks, liquidity, and other investment related issues. At the same time, asset managers and economically active young people want to enter and grow equity ownership in some investment opportunities but there are huge barriers or obstacles – lack of jobs/steady income, high cost of capital, unaffordable credit, and expensive cash based transactions. Thus, SIDO schemes aim to achieve these:</p>
<p>§ Make it simpler and smarter for revenue investors to safely and profitably enter and exit from various investment opportunities in key sectors of the economy – mainly housing/construction, agriculture, transport, trade, technology, and financial services. This way, investors can securely create shared wealth and build inclusive prosperity.</p>
<p>§ Make it cheaper and easier for asset managers and economically active young people to gradually build equity ownership in investment opportunities in key sectors of the economy. This way, young people are given the chance to cheaply purchase and own durable, tangible, valuable assets like houses/apartments at the early stages of their lives and careers.</p>
<p>§ Make it possible for young people to use their equity ownership as collateral or security for accessing affordable credit from various sources and contribution towards mortgage loan.</p>
<p><strong>3.0 Designing and Developing SidoSoft – Software as a Service</strong></p>
<p>Successful implementation of SIDO system requires the development of SidoSoft to automate the SIDO processes. SidoSoft is designed as cloud-based and SaaS technology solution for ownership intelligence and innovation management for selected revenue sensitive assets. SidoSoft is an important collaboration platform for preparing small businesses and employees/customers to become qualified to access affordable credit by integrating access to jobs, income, savings, ownership, credit and insurance. SidoSoft will grow to become a powerful new tool for digital disruption of traditional ownership models for certain revenue-producing assets with a special focus on real estate. The software will be developed by System Variant Limited and marketed by Dubbem Global Investment. </p>
<p><strong>4.0 Why Now for </strong><strong>SidoSoft and SIDO system?</strong></p>
<p>The modern world is presently talking about inclusive business, currency innovation, financial inclusion, impact investment, employment, access to credit, economic prosperity, creative capitalism (Gates foundation), resilient cities (Rockefeller foundation) and sustainable development (United Nations). As a result, entrepreneurs at Dubbem Global have recently developed SIDO system to show how all these are linked to sustainable impact investment, trade, and transfer through connecting investors and investees, investees and young people; plus present and future. Above all, the world’s credit system including conventional mortgage is currently NOT working for millions of economically active young people and their small businesses mainly in developing countries! Hence, new strategies like SIDO system are required to improve access to affordable credit. Surely, we need alternative, innovative approaches to creatively address the problem of lack of access to affordable credit.</p>
<p><strong>5.0 What the entrepreneurial team needs from you</strong></p>
<p>To develop and promote SidoSoft as a tool for advancing SIDO system, entrepreneurs at Dubbem Global need financial assistance and technical support from the general public. We need the support of everyone interested in understanding the roles of time, trade, technology (Internet), creativity, strategy, social network, ideas, innovation, and money (conventional and complementary) in advancing impact investing through SIDO. We want to raise ten thousand US dollars (US$10,000) through the crowd-funded initiative. This will enable us to develop SidoSoft plus online collaboration platform/marketplace for SIDO system. The success of the crowd-funding campaign will assist us to secure low-interest debt financing from suitable financial institutions promoting intelligent ownership trade powered by SidoSoft.  </p>
<p><strong>6.0 How you can help</strong></p>
<p>We are developing this fundraising campaign to solicit for your support which may be financial or in-kind (technical support, advice, and suggestions). Please feel free to donate any amount you can. Each donation procures a codified voucher. Regardless of whatever you donate, you will be issued a certificate of appreciation/recognition which will reflect amount donated and number of coded vouchers rewarded. We are issuing out 1,000 coded vouchers or pledge slots for this campaign and each voucher represents a value of ten dollars (US$10) as our funding goal is to reach ten thousand US dollars (US10,000) from this crowd-funded support campaign.</p>
<p><strong>7.0 What You Get – Your Immediate and Future Rewards</strong></p>
<p>Each contribution or donation will receive a ‘thank you letter’ plus coded certificate (soft copy) as evidence of your contribution and for reference purposes. This is in addition to other rewards (see below indicated in Perks). In future, if SidoSoft becomes successful, your donation will be turned into debt finance or equity investment in SIDO projects. To do this, we will request that donors and supporters provide copies of their certificates as evidence. In view of this, we ask that everyone keep their codified certificates safe and secure for future use.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Jimmy Fish is a playful western take on the Japanese fisherman. Growing up a big fan of anime culture combined with my recent career move to the Florida Keys, I felt incorporating a sushi theme into a fishing lifestyle brand would be fun!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<li>If we do not achieve our total goal of $2k we will use what has been pledged to continue the brand as fast as we can! ^_^</li>

<p>Project Description:</p>
<p>The Cocktail Parlor is a bakery hosting cupcakes, cookies, and other desserts inspired by classic and modern cocktails. We strive to bring the renaissance of the cocktail industry to a new realm; the edible cocktail. From an Old Fashioned or Negroni cupcake, to a Dark &amp; Stormy or Rob Rose cookie, each resembles its cocktail elder in dessert form. It is our goal to maintain the vitality and romanticism of the cocktail industry, one new confectionery at a time.  </p>
<p>As our company grows, we need a little bit of help from our community. The plan is to raise enough money to begin the process of applying for a large loan from a bank. Banks need some kind of collateral in order to accept your loan proposal. If you apply for a loan, they expect you to already have at least 25% of that loan. In order to begin the process of opening the bakery &amp; bar we need at least a $120,000 loan. So, the goal? We've got to bring $30,000 to the bank, or more if we can.</p>
<p>We have a complete business plan, associated projected sales, and an itemized budget that exceeds the norm and fits several different scenarios. What does that mean? We're ready to roll with the punches.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Biography:</p>
<p>I’m a bartender by trade, and a baker by blood. </p>
<p>I always wanted to open a café. When I was 12 I would draw up plans of design, create fake menus, and host lunches and dinners for my family. The idea of the café transformed over time into a consolidated plan for a bar and bakery. It truly couldn’t fit me any better.</p>
<p>I am a baking enthusiast with an eye for detail, an avidity for flavor and texture balance, and a gift of rationale and comprehension of the human experience, on a path to build a cocktail and cupcake haven, revolving in solace.</p>
<p>Overall in the state of any inspiration, we are all on a scavenger hunt, searching for our own definition of humanity and, as much as personally allotted, allowing the influences of the world take its toll on our inner beings. I strive for the things I want to accomplish. I think rationally and analytically with heaps of curiosity. I love thoroughly and passionately. I strive for something greater than the preliminary outlook of life. A friend once told me, “I know that of the two of us, you were, are, have been, and will always be the strongest. It’s because you love so hard— you live with your heart.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fundraising Packages:</p>
<p>The fundraising packages are meant to be a gift to show our gratitude for helping us meet our goal.  If we don’t meet our entire funding goal, the money raised will still go to the process of getting a loan, the timeline will just be extended. If we exceed the funding goal, the money raised will still go to the process of getting a loan, but the timeline will be expedited!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Challenges &amp; Risks:</p>
<p>Every business knows the possible risks and meets new challenges on a daily basis. With ours, the financial aspect of the business is our biggest challenge. But that’s why we’re here! We’re looking for ways to introduce ourselves to the community while also getting the community to feel involved in our growth. After all, our most favorite hashtag is #cupcakesforthepeople.</p>
<p>Once we've opened the bakery &amp; bar, we have a strict plan to gain and then raise sales, to attract new customers, to create new integrated products, and to always maintain quality.</p>
<p>Our most significant risk is the industry. Despite that we have a new concept that's appealing to a large audience we are still in an industry that has a 90% failing rate. How can we avoid statistics? We can easily be in the 10% of successful bars and restaurants with what we offer:</p>
<p>- a great and unique product,</p>
<p>- high quality customer service,</p>
<p>- heightened attention to detail,</p>
<p>- integrated products on an ever-growing list,</p>
<p>- and event opportunities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the owner, this business is not only my dream, it's my life. There is nothing that can deter me to making a brick &amp; mortar location into a reality. When a roadblock appears, we'll find the way around it by creating a new path. If there are rails making a new path impossible, we'll learn how to drive through concrete. You know, like Eggman in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, for the exception that he's the villain.</p>
<p>We are ready and willing to take on all of the risks and to shake hands with all of the challenges that arise. Whether it be a leaky faucet, or an out of date permit, we're ready to see it through.</p>

<p>If you’re unable to help fund this project, there are other ways you can help!</p>

<h2>Our Story &amp; Our Good Will Promise</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Yeung and I am a mother of two lovely toddlers. Since staying home full time, feeding and cleaning have become an integral part of my daily routines. Little children eat 5-6 times a day and being messy is inevitable. A little help from a well designed bib can reduce the mess to be cleaned up and sometimes even save the food that barely misses the little mouth. A functional feeding bib should catch food and liquid droppings in the chest area, and prevent soiling of clothes. Hard-molded plastic or silicone bibs are generally well suited for the tasks; however, they are less comfortable, rigid, heavy, bulky and require hand-washing. In fact, the launch of this project was driven by the unwillingness of my son to wear a hard plastic bib. I set out to design one that is comfortable, water-resistant and easy to clean. After a few weeks of twiddling around with paper towels, a basic design came to life. Soon after, I began making different versions of the bibs and trying them out on my toddler son. Very much to his liking was the attractive print and how comfortable it was for it to be made solely of fabrics. Ever since, he has been happy wearing the bib while eating and I have been happier not having to clean up as much or change his clothes as often. After spending months in tweaking and testing the design, I did not want the effort to go to waste. I thought that other parents may also be looking for a better alternative for feeding bibs. And voilà! here we are, trying to get some help to bring the bibs to the market so your little ones can also stay a little bit cleaner and the earth can also be a little greener with fewer plastic bibs.</p>

<p>As a small business for children accessories, not only do we want to share our useful products with other families, we also want to make a difference in children's lives around the world.

<h3>What We Need Help With</h3>
<p>After much looking around within the U.S., we found a wonderful small-batch manufacturer that is able to produce the bibs within our personal budgets. Due to the unique appearance and features of the bib, the manufacturing method is tedious compared to that of other bibs, which translates into higher labor cost. Also, given the choice of high quality cotton print fabrics, the material cost of our bib is also on the high end. In order to bring our bibs to major retail stores at an affordable price, large scale production is necessary. We are in need of significantly larger amount of funds to cover scale up cost for materials, production, packaging and shipping. In addition, our bib is pending for a utility patent, thus we need as much help as we can get to cover the necessary legal cost.</p>
<p>The main goal of this campaign is to raise funds for domestic and offshore mass production of the bibs to bring to local major retail stores where parents can conveniently purchase our bibs at an affordable price. Without lowering the labor cost or producing the bibs at a large quantity, the per unit cost of limited supply will make the bib too costly to many and fewer families would benefit from this novel design bib. Your contribution is therefore critical to the realization of our new business at this stage.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474233615/kofhbpi1zmdpstbebsps.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

I started my former video business in 1985 from nothing and with no bank help and in 15 years built it  to sales of over $ 1.2 million and created jobs for up to 30 people. In 2008 the income was $1.2 million in 2009  $170k. The recession created by the banks caused mine and thousands of business to fail. They got bailouts we did not.
I have a viable solution to my mortgage problem and need your help. You can come and stay and  enjoy the fruits of our collaboration..


The risk and challenges are the time to get it done by next summer and legal with the city planning board  
We need to apply for a liquor license and hire a general contractor to do the remolding.
Initial research shows I am zoned to be a B&B or Inn. I have done some of the code requirements like smoke detectors wired and battery, exit signs and have the cost for the other code requirements.
I have a experience engineer and lawyer standing by to carry the project forward
I can do all the marketing and radio,print and video advertising.
I have accounts for Air BnB, Home Away and Navy housing for the Saratoga Base
I will join the chamber of commerce and lodging bureau.

I am a hands on guy and remolded my former video office into 2 more bedrooms with a living room like a suite. I take care of the landscaping, fall leaf cleanup and snow removal. I do the cleaning and can cook too

<li>To build a robust, supportive environment in which our students can flourish creatively and emotionally.</li>
<li>To provide our students with ample performance and exhibition opportunities.</li>

<li>
<strong>Recognition</strong> is simply that – us letting the world know that you helped out! We have the capacity to give social media shout-outs (including linking to your business or personal web site) and to include recognition in our on-line student newsletters and in printed programmes for student performances.</li>
<li>
<strong>Advertising </strong>is available to all supporters who give $200 or more, and range from small ads in our student newsletters to full-page ads in our recital programmes. You can choose to advertise your own business, display a personal message, or donate your advertising space to your favourite local non-profit!</li>
<li>
<strong>Experiences</strong> are the very best perks we can offer! From a simple half-day workshop to an entire YEAR of “unlimited” weekly lessons (up to a $3,000 value), we're really putting ourselves out there by offering a variety of experiences to those who give $200 or more. If you are unable to use your Experience vouchers, you may choose to donate them back to the Company so we can pass them on to a deserving student!</li>

<li>
<strong>Start-Up Financing:</strong> Here we are. Start-up financing is easily our biggest obstacle. No one involved in these early stages of the Company is in a position to put forth any capital (for example, Roz is a janitor who lives paycheck-to-paycheck), so crowd-funding -followed by a tradition loan 5-6 months down the road- is our best option, for the moment.</li>
<li>
<strong>Human Resources:</strong> While we have a list of interested instructors already, it's a challenge to find the right people to instruct in a program like this. Not only must they be qualified in their respective artistic fields, but because of the range of students they will be interacting with, our instructors need to have a sense of patience and compassion above and beyond what is expected in an “average” arts program. We will overcome this challenge by turning to our personal networks and our local community (via social and traditional media) for instructor recommendations, by starting small (with just a few instructors) and by taking student feedback seriously. We will hold our instructors to a very high standard.</li>
<li>
<strong>Trust-Building:</strong> We need to build trust on several levels. Within our community, the public needs to be able to trust our name to be indicative of caring, quality programming. Students need to be able to trust that they are receiving quality instruction. Instructors and staff need to be able to trust their employer. And so on. We will rise to meet the challenge of student trust-building by being organized, courteous, and conscientious in every student interaction. We will treat our instructors and staff well, to ensure they are inspired to do their best possible work for us. We will be the trust we wish to earn.</li>

Five years later we embraced veganism and slowly gravitated from West to East London, now calling Hackney home.Chocolate and Blueberry Cake I’ve always enjoyed learning and with my newfound interest in veganism, I found myself exploring more and more in the kitchen while revelling in the challenge of veganising my favourite recipes and traditional Brazilian dishes. With my friends always asking for the recipes, the inevitable happened. In 2012 the Essential Vegan blog was born.Brazilian Coconut Sweet Bread The blog quickly gained a loyal readership which led to the development of a fully-fledged website. Neni documented my dishes with his camera as I continued to bake, braise, boil, steam and stir… and before we knew it we were taking our Essential Vegan cookbook out of the oven in September 2013.Essential Vegan Cookbook Things were getting serious! I quit my day job and went back to school, studying to become a vegetarian and vegan nutritional consultant. I launched a stall in Brick Lane’s Boiler House selling cakes and burgers, I started giving cookery classes, Neni and I ran a kitchen residency in Portobello Road and we staged other pop ups, becoming regulars at major fairs such as VegFest (London and Brighton) and the Animal Aid Xmas Market.Essential Burger In the Summer of 2015 we took over a little shack at PUMP Shoreditch, serving our classic Essential Burger and cakes, making our mark in East London with regulars coming back for more. It was around this time that we started experimenting with making cashew nut based cheese, which is now stocked in a handful of wholefood shops and in 2017 we orchestrated an eight-week kitchen residency at Haunt in Stoke Newington. It was such a successful residency that the owner turned vegan and the venue remains vegan to this day! Our nut base cheese It doesn’t get much better than that really.

<p>The Ability Accelerator is a virtual community of business professionals helping individuals affected by disabilities become entrepreneurs through funding, support, and training.</p>

<p>This leads to poverty, powerlessness and prison.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, about half of disabled Americans were employed, according to Census data. Today that has fallen to just 41%.  Some of the decline is due to an aging population.

<p>Today, entrepreneurship is on the rise:</p>
<p>-400,000 businesses are started each year</p>
<p>​-By 2020, 40% of our workforce will be self-employed</p>
