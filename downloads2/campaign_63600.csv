<p>My
name is Jessica-Faye Watters; I am a 25 year old artist living in Ottawa,
Ontario. On Thanksgiving 2009 I became ill with bronchitis which soon developed
into H1N1. As I'm sure many have heard, it was a brutal flu but what remains
lesser known are the long term effects of this illness. I never seemed to get better,
in fact I actually grew worse. One by one causes were ruled out; concerns of an
eating disorder were even raised, but after seeing 2 therapists these fears
were dispelled. After years of specialists, ineffective drugs, tests that were
invasive and sometimes quite unpleasant, and even tube feeding after a weight
loss of over 120 lbs, it wasn't until the end of 2012 that I was finally
diagnosed with a condition known as <b>Gastroparesis</b>.</p>
<p>Simply explained, this is a disorder that slows or stops
the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Within our bodies
is the vagus nerve that controls the muscles of the stomach that normally
contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal tract as
well as the hormones and enzymes that helps us digest food. It goes deeper than
this, however, also controlling our involuntary functions such as breathing,
blood pressure, swallowing and heart rate. Even our emotions are affected by
it. Gastroparesis occurs when that nerve becomes damaged by injury/illness and
the stomach muscles cease to contract normally. This slows or all together
stops movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.</p>
<p>According to a Gastric Emptying Study done Nov 2012 this
is how my stomach empties compared to an average person.</p>

<li>  4 hr normal:

</ul><p>
</p><p>My day to day life includes but isn't always limited to
the following:</p>

<li>  Constant

<li>  Constant Nausea</li>
<li>  Vomiting
(inability to keep ANY food down or even small bits of fluids at times)</li>

<li>  Dry Skin</li>
<li>  Anxiety</li>
<li>  Depression</li>
</ul><p>
</p><p>Even with a diagnosis I still find myself in medical
limbo. Since Gastroparesis has no known cure at this time and without earlier
identification I have become too weak to even take the medication that would
normally be prescribed for this. I was given a trial of Metoclopramide,
Domperidone and Erythromycin (3 of the leading names in Gastroparesis
treatment) but after having bad side effects from all, the last even landing me
in ER I was told I could no longer even attempt them due to the potential of
heart damage it could cause. This is due to having also developed chronic low
potassium or Hypokalemia. the deterioration has also caused me to develop
Fibromyalgia, which adds more pain to certain points in my body.</p>
<p>Different procedures exist to try and combat this
condition but my specialist has advised me to keep clear of them, saying that
his other patients have actually gotten worse after having undergone them and
while tube feeding is an option my blood work and state of mind are healthier
by my current regiment of trying to eat by mouth, even though I can't keep it
down. Come November, I will be attempting the Erythromycin once again; I pray
my body will be able to benefit from it.</p>
<p>More and more I see news of fellow GPers passing away and
I am left scared and longing for my old self. I want to be there for the people
I love and who have supported me throughout this nightmare. I can't begin to
describe the expenses that have been exhausted, 
financially and emotionally. One by one I lost the dreams I'd struggled
to achieve. I am passionate about expressing myself through my art, whether it
be by hand, computer or photography; I have a certificate in
Pre-animation/Illustration had been transitioning from Algonquin College's
Animation program to a winter intake course, with plans to apply to Photography
when my health became too weak to attend school. I now carry a hefty student
debt, caused by medical expenses rather than education. With the aid of my
loving parents I took a 6 month leave from work at Coliseum Ottawa Theater
until the costs were too great. I worked in a limited position at the theater
for another year only to have my health decline faster. It wasn't until my
doctor firmly advised me to do so that I had to leave the job I loved. I am on
Disability now but have discovered many limitations with what the program can
actually provide. While full recovery may seem a distant dream I want to
continue living my life and being a part of others.</p>
<p>For day to day living, I must constantly keep a hefty
supply of vitamins and Gatorade as well as use Restorlax 1-2 daily to function
properly. These are items that are not considered medical, yet I can't live
without and take their toll financially. There are different alternative
measures and therapies that I would like to attempt to try and stimulate
healing, not only physically but emotionally as well, but I am unable to afford
them at this time. There is also medical equipment to help ease the day to day
symptoms, such as a hospital bed since I am unable to lift my body some days
due to the deterioration, enamel restoration for my teeth (the amount of
vomiting has left the nerves exposed), tools to help food preparation since my
energy is limited and even just day to day needs like high calorie foods to
gain weight and warm clothing for the upcoming Winter since I am now so
sensitive to the temperature. Additional funds above the target goal would be
greatly appreciated to realistically cover what I need. I believe if I could at
least build up my strength and get my weight up, I can survive this ordeal.</p>
<p>Any support would be greatly appreciated at this time.
Gastroparesis is considered an invisible disease, and even those who are
suffering the worse do not always appear sick to the people around them. Many
have lost their battle and I refuse to lose mine!</p><p>I am working to spread awareness, creating content that can be found here:<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/1506434642943465/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><br/></a></p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/1506434642943465/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">It's Not Easy Being Green</a></p><p><br/></p></div>","With the 5 year anniversary of my life threatening

<h3>
<em>Holiday Greeting from Stable Connections</em>                    </h3>
<p>This past year was a challenging but a rewarding one for Stable Connections. We were busy with our Summer Equine Assisted Programs, which concentrate on providing psychosocial therapy for at-risk youth groups, our Therapeutic Riding/Horsemanship Program and private psychotherapy sessions. It was incredibility rewarding to see the change in all of our students over the course of the summer.</p>
<p>We rolled into September offering private sessions and because of the increased need; we offered a fall Equine Assisted Psychotherapy group program. It quickly became clear in order to meet the growing need for our services, and offer programming year round we need to cover our program arena so we can continue rain or shine. In an effort to meet this goal, we applied for two separate grants but we need additional funds to ensure this dream becomes a reality.</p>
<p>During the season of giving, I am asking you to become part of the Stable Connections team and help transform lives of individuals that have been either physically or emotionally scarred. With your generous support, we will be able to cover the arena and expand the numbers of clients by providing additional services on a yearly basis.</p>
<div>
<h3><em>EXPANSION OF THERAPY ARENA</em></h3>
<p>The business has established solid relationships with the area Mental Health Agencies, but unfortunately due to the weather we have cancelled too many appointments with these clients and consistency is the key to the client’s long term goals.</p>
<p>The existing outdoor arena of 60 ft. x 120 ft. has been made with sand/clay footing for the horses; we have leveled the surrounding ground area and purchased appropriate fencing in order to expand the area to 80 ft. x 140 ft., thus allowing us to treat multiple clients at the same time.</p>
<p>It is imperative that we raise the necessary funds to cover our outdoor program/riding arena to continue our programs even when the weather is inclement. This will be the only indoor riding arena available to serve clients in the northern New Hampshire and Vermont area.</p>
</div>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Equine Assisted Psychotherapy and Equine Assisted Learning</span></p>
<p>These constitute the core programs at Stable Connections.  Our facilitating team includes a licensed mental health therapist, equine specialist and when appropriate, additional qualified specialists. This team approach allows us to provide the highest quality services for our clients.</p>
<p>This type of interactive psychotherapy (EAP) with the horse is conducted on the ground and involves no mounted riding. Whether dealing with issues of addiction, depression, behavioral disorders, and trauma, grief, loss or relationship difficulties, clients have discovered new hope and lasting solutions through our equine assisted psychotherapy program.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Therapeutic Riding </span> </p>
<p>The goal of our Therapeutic Riding Programs is to teach the basics of horsemanship and riding. We strive for riders to become as independent as possible! Our goal is to increase the client's physical, cognitive, and emotional development by using the gently and rhythmic movement from horseback riding. </p>
A few of the disabilities we currently treat: Cerebral palsy, low muscle tone, severe learning disabilities, speech or vision impairment, epilepsy, autism, attention deficit disorders, emotional disabilities, Down Syndrome and Rett Syndrome.                                                                                                 
<p>The Community Need</p>
<p>Consistency is the key to overall health for our client base. Whether we are dealing with emotional or physical disabilities, having to cancel appointments due to the weather is disappointing to everyone. This past summer due to the weather, we cancelled twenty-five separate sessions and this past September, ten sessions had to be cancelled.      </p>
<p>Our Goal is to increase our current programming to include programs for the Wounded Warrior Project, double our Therapeutic Riding program and increase our ability to help more at-risk children with behavioral issues. The site has been prepared for the covered arena by leveling the ground surrounding the existing arena. </p>
<p>Our focus as a business is on wellness and empowerment and I believe that we offer a truly unique program that will help the lives of many people with varied needs. It is because of your commitment to the community that I appeal to you and your organization to help with establishing a year round program facility. A grant from your organization would allow us to meet the needs of so many individuals that desperately need this service.</p>
<p>Taking this unique opportunity to become part of the future of Stable Connections helps us to become the premier Equine Assisted Psychotherapy Program in Vermont and New Hampshire. </p>
<p>By becoming part of Stable Connections team, you will help transform the lives of individuals that have been either physically or emotionally scarred. With your generous support, we will be able to cover the arena which will allow us to expand the availability of services to our clients.    </p>

<p></p></div>","The Club and the CommunityThe Nipissing District Tennis Club is a seasonal tennis club in North Bay, Ontario with 6 courts and 246 members in 2013.  The club is owned by Fransua Rachmann and Bobby Ray. NDTC is the only tennis club in North Bay that offers a membership, programming, socials, leagues and tournaments.  We also offer tennis lessons for anyone from individual lessons to large school groups. In the summer we offer 8 weeks of summer camps for children between 7 and 17 years old.Bobby and Fransua only recently took over management of the courts. But the courts have not been resurfaced or properly maintained since 2007.  Of the 6 courts, 3 courts will be dangerous to play on next season.  Since North Bay is in Northern Ontario, it gets a lot of snow in the winter and the club only operate from April to October.  The big fluctuations in temperature causes the courts that were constructed more than 20 years ago to heave and crack.  Short term repairs have been attempted, but to make the courts safe and playable for the future, extensive reconstruction of the courts will have to be done.Contributors to the NDTC will help us deliver a service to more than 83000 people in North Bay and the Nipissing District.  A big part of the community are First Nations and with updated facilities we will be able to invite school groups and adults from the whole Nipissing District to introduce tennis to them and promote health and fitness.We would also like to make our facility more wheelchair accessible.  We need to convert part of our gravel parking lot and walkways into paved surface to accommodate wheelchairs.  We also need to convert our washrooms into wheelchair accessible units. Recently there has been a need for wheelchair access to the courts, and we want to meet those needs and also be able to promote wheelchair tennis in Northern Ontario.Our main goal is to introduce children to the game of tennis, have families play tennis together and to get people more active and fit. We want to break the notion of tennis being a ""snobby"" or ""elite"" sport and promote it as an affordable, fun activity for people of any age and all walks of life.Tennis is one of the few sports where a whole family can play together on one court, children and adults can keep a ball going over the net or play points against each other or parents can help their children practice coordination or hitting the ball.We offer tennis to people at very reasonable prices and people can even come and try tennis for free since they can borrow racquets and balls from the club at no cost.  We increased our membership from 172 members in the 2012 season (under previous management) to 246 members in 2013 and our next goal is to reach 275 members in 2014, but to make that possible we'll need all 6 courts to be in match play condition.Fransua and Bobby are the owners of Robert Fransua Inc. a sport management, coaching and event organising company. They became the owners of the Nipissing District Tennis Club in May 2013.Fransua has more than 15 years of coaching experience and has coached tennis in South Africa, the UK, USA and in the United Arab Emirates and now in Canada. He is one of only 125 coaches in Canada that has a Club Pro 2 Canadian Tennis Professional Association qualification. Fransua also has a Sport Psychology Diploma and a Business Management Diploma.Bobby Ray is a recent graduate of Nipissing University's Bachelor of Physical and Health Education program. Bobby is also the General Manager of the North Bay Granite Curling Club and volunteers with Sport North Bay and the local Young Professionals Committee.Why we need fundingFunding is needed for four areas at NDTC:1) Reconstruction of court 1, 2, 5 and 6.2 Resurfacing of court 3 and 43) Construction of wheelchair accessible walkways and washrooms4) Promotion and sponsorship of tennis to First Nations1) Court #1 currently has a crack running down the middle of it that is at certain places more than 2 inches wide and getting deeper with each rain fall. The crack is now spreading to court #2 and is getting to the point where the crack is not just affecting the bounce of the ball when it lands near the crack, but also starts being a tripping hazard to players. In places the crack is wide enough for a tennis shoe to fit into, if someone steps on the edge of this crack he or she might sprain or break an ankle.$80 000 will go towards demolition, lying a new foundation and then resurfacing of court #1 and #2Court #5 and #6 are the first courts that were built at the venue in 1960.  The courts were maintained and resurfaced numerous times over the years, but frost and heaving of the foundation has finally rendered these courts unfit for play.  The bumps and holes in the courts make bounces unpredictable and have caused people to trip on the courts. The lights on these courts are also outdated, inefficient and currently burned out bulbs that need to be replaced are not accessible. The posts used on these courts are higher than health and safety permit standard equipment to reach.  So a specialized crane will have to be rented every time a light bulb needs to be replaced.  Tennis specific lights with energy efficient bulbs will solve this problem.It will cost $110 000 to completely dig up these courts and replace the light posts.2) Court #3 and #4 are currently the only 2 courts that are in decent match playable shape.  But courts should ideally be resurfaced at least every 5 years and the last time that the courts were resurfaced was in 2007. Especially in regions where there are high fluctuations in temperature, keeping court surfaces in good shape seals the upper layers from water penetration.  Any water that seep into hairline cracks will freeze in the winter, expand and cause large fractures and bumps and dips on the court of the same nature as court #5 and #6.It will cost at least $20000 to resurface these two courts and insure their current condition for another 5 to 8 years3) Wheelchair accessibility is extremely important to give handicapped people in our region the opportunity to also experience playing tennis.  It is also important to us that our facility be accessible to handicapped spectators or family and friends of players.We have some walkways at the club at the moment and we also have a ramp that leads into our clubhouse.  But we have a gravel parking lot and a crushed rock path at one entrance and a grass patch at the other entrance that lead up to the walkways that make it extremely difficult for a wheelchair to reach the walkways.Our small washroom has also not been updated since the club has been established on the property in the 80's.  We have one unisex washroom with a toilet and a sink in a 5'x4' space.  We do have some space to expand and we need to convert some of our storage space into a larger washroom facility that is accessible for wheelchairs and provide a better looking and more comfortable washroom facility to our members and visitors to the club.Paving a small part of our parking lot will cost $6000 and expanding and updating the washroom will cost $120004) Providing services to First Nations in our area has been a long term goal for our company.  We have the opportunity to bring children to our facility and introduce them to tennis.  We also have the chance then to identify First Nation children with the drive and talent that might be interested in continuing lessons at the club and have the opportunity to compete in matches and tournaments at the club and in tournaments in Ontario.We also would like to market tennis to First Nations families as a fun activity that they can enjoy together to promote family values, fitness and recreation.With $12000 we'll be able to promote the sport, pay for transport to and from the club. and pay for lessons and equipment for at least two seasons at NDTC.   Plan BIf we don't get the desired amount of funding, we have to concentrate on the most important issues of the club in the following order.<$16 000 - The large crack on court #1 can get a short term fix by just concentrating on the crack itself and it can be sealed very cheaply at the beginning of each season.

For me, that person was my stepfather, John Fenstermacher. As a high school wrestling coach he really fostered my love of the sport and encouraged me to become a professional athlete.

<p><br/>TRACKS is not my first running app with RPG elements that I’ve used, but it’s the first app to successfully scared the crap out of me. The sounds were so realistic — having a good pair of earphones is not helping at all! — I actually caught myself looking back while running. Especially since I tried the first chapter at 11:30pm. Not even the zombie version was as scary. I highly suggest runners to NOT run with TRACKS at night. Unless you’re a horror fan, then you would probably enjoy it a lot.</p>

</div>","No more boring running.Sound blockbuster for running, TRACKS! 

Same music, same roads…And that’s how you’ve stopped running.
Introducing a new way of running with TRACKS app where stories lead how you run.





Check out our story in detail on TheNextWeb







TRACKS is not my first running app with RPG elements that I’ve used, but it’s the first app to successfully scared the crap out of me. The sounds were so realistic — having a good pair of earphones is not helping at all! — I actually caught myself looking back while running. Especially since I tried the first chapter at 11:30pm. Not even the zombie version was as scary. I highly suggest runners to NOT run with TRACKS at night. Unless you’re a horror fan, then you would probably enjoy it a lot.

ALSON KAWCreative Director @ Caffein8 Creative LABS



Ready to run?Lace up your runner and open up TRACKS.The platoon and growlers are waiting for you.


Step 1. Plug in your earbuds.Step 2. Select an episode.Step 3. Run and complete all missions.Step 4. Check out your run results and ranking.







   INTRO


Growler...Although they take the shape of humans, the Growlers are over 2 meters tall, wrapped in bandages, and black. They react to sound and heat,  as well as hunt humans.
 
The Growlers are chasing, the buildings are collapsing.Avoid all shells falling from the skies.
 The road you run becomes an action film scene with total 15 episodes of Growler series. The episodes present a variety of missions featuring sessions of sprints, shocking, intervals, and more of the most efficient 10 types of running.



SOUND EQUAL TO A BLOCKBUSTER FILM


Our focus was on creating the most realistic in-app sounds to make sure you run.



   POINT 1. Same sound production process as foley





 Realism is the foundation of TRACKS.  TRACKS’s main focus is to make scenes come true in runners’ minds without the visuals. To achieve this, we used the same workflow as the film makers, foley. TRACKS is an experience beyond audiobooks.
 Imagination was evident in our sound design stages in order to make all scenes as realistic as possible. Each scene and movement in our visualizations were recreated with sound that we believe would happen. Imagine a scene where growlers invade an army base from the ceiling. As the glass and the lights come crashing down, all background noise except the cracking sounds are eliminated. We then play the collapsing sound in reverse to create higher tension followed by a soundless void that gets you to stop and listen.

 When the growlers enter the scene, they come in with the whoosh sound in the background. Detailed sounds from their entrance like the falling debris and the cracking of the stone floor are layered to showcase the growlers’ landing movements.




 Find the final product of all combined sounds we’ve mentioned above here.Test out our sound and jump into the scene itself.
As if you are watching a film,feel the surround sound from the growlers chasing,feel the gunshot whizzing by your ears,but you only need your earphones.
TRACKS, your sound blockbuster. 



   POINT 2. Run, as if you are watching a film.

 Growlers’ sounds are all created with “Dehumanizer Pro” for its high quality. Dehumanizer is used to create sounds for Marvel’s “Avengers: AGE OF ULTRON” and the upcoming Disney film, “THE JUNGLE BOOK”.


< Dehumaniser >
Dehumaniser is a vocal processing software that can create realistic monster sounds in real time. It does not utilize samples and therefore designs a situation-specific sound.




   POINT 3. TRY TRACKS NOW!
 We recommend you to open up our first episode, “GROWLER” in the early evening when the sun sets and the dark night begins. Let your body listen, feel, and react to the growlers chasing after you.







RUN! GET THE MOST HONORABLE RANK.


 After you accomplished each chapter, your personal running data and rank will be recorded on a Daily Feed. You can easily access not only your today's data but the amount of yours.

 Our rank system is divided as six levels including hidden class. You will get a rank called The Evidence Finder as a beginner.
 As you accomplish your chapters and gain more points, you can get a higher rank like The Secret Spy, The Demolition Expert, etc. Also there is a hidden class you can't get if you're challenge your limits and get a most honorable rank, The Growler Annihilator. Rank up and be one of the leading lights in the defense force.

Those who love jogging or running.
Those who are training for marathon more fun.
Those who want to run efficiently.

</div><h3>Waste Vegetable Oil (WVO) Fuel</h3><h3><b style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">Why will we travel with Waste Vegetable Oil (WVO)?</b></h3><p>One of our main purposes in traveling through Latin America is to learn and share knowledge about health and environmental care in the communities we visit. Therefore, we would like our transportation method to be as environmentally friendly as possible. In Latin America, there aren’t many sources of ‘clean energy’ for cars, especially not easily accessible for the general public. After  researching more about the topic, we decided this was the most accessible form of clean energy for us.</p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">What are the advantages of using this type of alternative fuel?</b></p><p>First, we will recycle thousands of gallons of used kitchen oil that would otherwise be poured down the drain, polluting water and soil because there is no system to adequately dispose<span> the oil in Latin America. Secondly, WVO fuel is 100% renewable. We will most likely travel over 15,000 kilometers. Think about all the CO2 we won’t be releasing into the atmosphere! Lastly, WVO is free.  This means saving on gas money during the trip.  </span></p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">How will we obtain WVO as we travel?</b></p><p><span></span></p><p>We will ask restaurants and hotels that deep fry for their used oil (Asian restaurants, for example).</p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">How do WVO vehicles work?</b></p>To run on WVO, the vehicle must be diesel, preferably between the years 1985 and 2002. Our van is a 1987 E350 Ford. We will use a 2-tank system, one for diesel and the other for the WVO. We will buy a conversion kits to adapt our car to work with WVO. Once the vehicle is converted, the car will turn on with the diesel fuel and once it is hot, we will switch it to the WVO fuel. To turn the car off, we'll switch back to diesel. Additionally, the vegetable oil needs to be filtered before it can be used. We will use a centrifuge for filtering.

<h2><span>Aceite Vegetal como Combustible </span></h2>
<p><b>¿Porque Viajaremos con Aceite Vegetal Usado (WVO)?</b></p>
<p>Gran parte de nuestro objetivo viajando por Latinoamérica es poder aprender y compartir nuestros saberes de salud y ambiente en las comunidades que visitemos. Por lo tanto queremos que nuestro método de transporte sea, dentro de lo posible, con ‘Energía Limpia.’ En Latinoamérica no existen muchas fuentes de energía renovable para carros, sobre todo al alcance del público. Despues de investigar mas el tema, decidimos que esta era la mejor opción para nosotros.</p>
<p><b><b>¿Cuales son las ventajas de este combustible alternativo?</b></b><br/></p>
<p>Primeramente, reciclaremos cientos de litros de aceite usado que de manera contraria serían agentes contaminantes en el agua y los suelos, ya que la mayor parte de Latino America no tiene sistema adecuada para desechar este material. Ademas, este combustible es 100% renovable y gratis. Viajaremos mas que 15,000 kilometros. ¡Imaginate todo el dióxido de carbono que nos salvamos de contaminar! Por ultimo, WVO es gratis, lo que implica un gran ahorro de gastos en combustible.  </p>
<p><b>¿Cómo obtendremos el WVO mientras viajamos? <br/></b></p>
<p>Le pediremos a restaurantes  y hoteles en el camino por su aceite vegetal usado, como por ejemplo a restaurantes asiaticos o locales que usan mucho aceite para freír.</p>
<p><b>¿Cómo funciona un vehículo con aceite vegetal usado (WVO)?</b></p>
<p>Para que un carro funcione con WVO, ESTE debe ser diesel, preferiblemente entre los años 1985 y 2002.  Nuestra van es un Ford E350 del anio 1987. Utilizaremos un sistema de doble tanque. Compraremos un ‘kit’ para adaptar nuestro carro para que funcione con aceite vegetal. Despues de realizar esta conversion,  el carro se encenderA con combustible de diesel y cuando esta caliente lo cambiaremos es preferible de manera que un tanque sea para el diesel y el otro para el WVO. Siempre se debe filtrar el aceite vegetal antes de usarlo. Cuando el vehículo esté ya adaptado, el carro se enciende con combustible diesel, después de que esté caliente se cambia al tanque de combustible WVO. De igual manera para apagarlo, uno lo cambia a diesel.

The Route: We will begin the trip in early 2016 from Guatemala. We will make our way through Central and South America, visiting about 2 communities per country.
Follow our journey www.facebook/caminocasamel 



Aidan & Johanna
Aidan: I'm a General Doctor who enjoys being spontaneous, doing new things, exploring, making a difference and showing the world it is possible to do things differently. I'm Guatemala and I feel the Latin American blood that runs through my veins very strongly.
Johanna: I'm an American-German-Venezuelan who dreams of a border-less world. For the last few years, I have been working on the community level with various environmental projects in Caracas, Venezuela. From these experiences stems my passion to creatively discover and share about more sustainable ways of living in balance with nature and people.




  What We Need & What You Get
We've purchased the van for our trip. Now we need $8,000 to begin the expedition! These costs are for adapting the van to work with waste-vegetable-oil, buying a centrifuge for filtering the oil, converting the van into a house-car, and expenses for our first 3  months of the trip.
Here is our cost breakdown:



Get our book
Upon completion of the journey, all of our supporters who contribute with +$25 will receive an e-book documenting all of our findings. For those who support us with a hundred-dollar donation, or more, we will send you a printed and signed copy of the book!The book will contain everything we learn from ancient medicinal practices to local indigenous customs that the majority of us in the industrialized world have forgotten. We will also feature anecdotes from the people who share these experiences with us.  If we don't reach our entire goal, we will use the amount raised 
towards adapting the car to work with waste-vegetable-oil and then towards converting it into a house-car.



What we want to learn:




Natural Medicine: Compile botanical and ancient health knowledge from each region

Health and environmental impact of changing life styles: Gain an 
in-depth understanding of the causes and consequences of globalization’s
 consumer trends and how it effects on the lifestyle of these small 
isolated communities.

Agro-Ecology: Learn more about alternative farming methods with 
hands-on experience and learn more about how conventional farming is 
affecting the health and environments of local populations

   What we will do


As we are going to visit rural communities learning about natural medicine, we will also provide preventative medical attention and do recycling projects because we believe it’s important to have a mutual exchange with the people we get to know.Aidan, the Doctor, will provide Health Care: Sharing knowledge about how to prevent and treat common illnesses and local health-related issues. Aidan will also provide emergency medical attention such as attending births, caring for cuts and injuries, detecting malnutrition and other medical emergencies.

 Johanna will lead Recycling Projects: some examples are a bottle cap mural, shoes and garden decoration with tires, crafts with junk food wrappers, construction with plastic bottles, and more. 


How will we find the communities we visit?We will use two main avenues for connecting with rural communities:

1. Prior connections: We are connected to many individuals, social projects and NGOs throughout Latin America. Through this network we will find out about and be directed towards various communities. As we travel, we also hope to get connect to more people and communities. 2. Random: Since we don't have prior connections in all the countries we hope to visit, we will also select some communities 'randomly' with as much research and preparation as possible from nationals in the country.

Other Ways You Can HelpOur project is mainly sustained by donors interested in supporting research and donors with generous hearts who believe in our cause!

Here are some other ways to support Camino Casamel:
1. Share our campaign page and promo-video through social media and with people that may be interested in supporting us!
2. Commit to supporting us monthly with $10, $25 or $50. These funds will go towards replenishing medical supplies, border crossing fees and other important expenses that arise as we are on our trip. Contact us at caminocasamel@gmail.com to learn more.
3. We are exploring products we can create and sell, such as natural soaps made with vegetable oil. We would love to hear any ideas you may have.

In Latin America, there aren’t many sources of ‘clean energy’ for cars, especially not easily accessible for the general public. After  researching more about the topic, we decided this was the most accessible form of clean energy for us.What are the advantages of using this type of alternative fuel?First, we will recycle thousands of gallons of used kitchen oil that would otherwise be poured down the drain, polluting water and soil because there is no system to adequately dispose the oil in Latin America. Secondly, WVO fuel is 100% renewable. We will most likely travel over 15,000 kilometers. Think about all the CO2 we won’t be releasing into the atmosphere! Lastly, WVO is free.  This means saving on gas money during the trip.  How will we obtain WVO as we travel?We will ask restaurants and hotels that deep fry for their used oil (Asian restaurants, for example).How do WVO vehicles work?To run on WVO, the vehicle must be diesel, preferably between the years 1985 and 2002. Our van is a 1987 E350 Ford. We will use a 2-tank system, one for diesel and the other for the WVO. We will buy a conversion kits to adapt our car to work with WVO. Once the vehicle is converted, the car will turn on with the diesel fuel and once it is hot, we will switch it to the WVO fuel. To turn the car off, we'll switch back to diesel. Additionally, the vegetable oil needs to be filtered before it can be used. We will use a centrifuge for filtering.

Aidan  y Johanna

Aidan: Soy
 Medico General, me gusta ser espontáneo, reinventar, explorar y sobre 
todo marcar la diferencia y demostrarle al mundo que se pueden hacer las
 cosas distintas.  Soy de Guatemala y en mis venas corre la sangre de 
 América Latina. 
Johanna: Soy una Gringa-Alemana-Venezolana que sueña con un mundo sin fronteras. Durante
 los últimos años, he trabajando en varios proyectos ambientales a nivel
 comunitario en Caracas, Venezuela. De estas experiencias surge mi 
pasión de creativamente descubrir y compartir maneras mas sustentables 
de vivir, con mayor equilibrio con la naturaleza y las personas.
 


Lo que necesitamos y lo que tu recibiras
Ya
 compramos la van para el viaje. Ahora necesitamos $8,000 para empezar 
la expedición, estos costos son para adaptar la van para que funcione 
con aceite vegetal usado, comprar una centrifugadora para filtrar el 
aceite, convertir la van en un casa-carro y los costos para los primeros
 3 meses del viaje. 




Obten nuestro libro 

Al
 terminar el viaje, todos nuestros apoyadores recibirán un libro 
electronico con todos nuestros encuentros, especificamente de medicina 
natural y formas mas sostenibles de vivir. Para los que nos apoyan con 
una donación de $100 o mas, les daremos una copia impresa y firmada del 
libro.
Todo
 lo que aprenderemos será recopilado en el libro, este incluirA temas 
como practicas ancestrales de medicina y tradiciones indígenas locales 
que la mayoría de nosotro en el mundo industrializado hemos dejado 
atras, destacando anecdotas de las personas que nos comparten estas 
experiencias.

Lo que queremos aprender:
Medicina Natural: Conocer,
 observar y aprender de los métodos de medicina natural y conocimientos 
de salud ancestrales de cada region, y así ampliar los conocimientos en 
medicina natural y darlos a conocer a personas quienes nos apoyan.
Efectos locales de salud y ambiente por estilos de vida cambiantes: Observar
 más a fondo las causas y consecuencias en los cambios de patrones de 
consumo y estilo de vida en las comunidades rurales por la globalización
 y los efectos que conllevan estas acciones.
Agroecología: Conocer
 a través de la práctica métodos alternativos de siembra y aprender mas a
 fondo como la siembra convencional afecta la salud y el ambiente local 
del agricultor. 






Lo que Haremos

Durante
 el viaje cuando visitemos comunidades rurales aprendiendo acerca de 
medicina natural, daremos atención médica preventiva y haremos proyectos
 de reciclaje porque creemos que es importante tener un intercambio 
mutuo con las personas que conocemos.
Aidan, el doctor, dara atencion medica: Compartiendo informacion de como prevenir y tratar enfermedades comunes y temas de salud local. Aidan
 también proveerá atención médica emergente, como por ejemplo atención 
de partos, curar heridas y lesiones, detección de malnutrición. 
Johanna hara proyectos de reciclaje:  Mural
 con tapitas de botellas plásticas (u otro tipo de material reusable), 
zapatos y objetos para jardinería elaborados con cauchos 
(llantas), manualidades con plastico de comida chatarra 
(chuchería), compost (creando abono natural), entre otros.


Otras Formas de Apoyarnos

Nuestro proyecto se sostiene principalmente por donaciones por personas interesadas en nuestras investigaciones de medicina natural y por personas con corazones generosas que creen en nuestra causa.

Estamos explorando la opción de crear y vender productos para generar ingresos en el trayecto, como por ejemplo crear jabónes natural a base de aceite vegetal. Si tienes alguna idea háganoslo saber.






Aceite Vegetal como Combustible 
¿Porque Viajaremos con Aceite Vegetal Usado (WVO)?
Gran parte de nuestro objetivo viajando por Latinoamérica es poder aprender y compartir nuestros saberes de salud y ambiente en las comunidades que visitemos. Por lo tanto queremos que nuestro método de transporte sea, dentro de lo posible, con ‘Energía Limpia.’ En Latinoamérica no existen muchas fuentes de energía renovable para carros, sobre todo al alcance del público. Despues de investigar mas el tema, decidimos que esta era la mejor opción para nosotros.
¿Cuales son las ventajas de este combustible alternativo?
Primeramente, reciclaremos cientos de litros de aceite usado que de manera contraria serían agentes contaminantes en el agua y los suelos, ya que la mayor parte de Latino America no tiene sistema adecuada para desechar este material. Ademas, este combustible es 100% renovable y gratis. Viajaremos mas que 15,000 kilometros. ¡Imaginate todo el dióxido de carbono que nos salvamos de contaminar! Por ultimo, WVO es gratis, lo que implica un gran ahorro de gastos en combustible.  
¿Cómo obtendremos el WVO mientras viajamos? 
Le pediremos a restaurantes  y hoteles en el camino por su aceite vegetal usado, como por ejemplo a restaurantes asiaticos o locales que usan mucho aceite para freír.
¿Cómo funciona un vehículo con aceite vegetal usado (WVO)?
Para que un carro funcione con WVO, ESTE debe ser diesel, preferiblemente entre los años 1985 y 2002.  Nuestra van es un Ford E350 del anio 1987. Utilizaremos un sistema de doble tanque. Compraremos un ‘kit’ para adaptar nuestro carro para que funcione con aceite vegetal. Despues de realizar esta conversion,  el carro se encenderA con combustible de diesel y cuando esta caliente lo cambiaremos es preferible de manera que un tanque sea para el diesel y el otro para el WVO. Siempre se debe filtrar el aceite vegetal antes de usarlo. Cuando el vehículo esté ya adaptado, el carro se enciende con combustible diesel, después de que esté caliente se cambia al tanque de combustible WVO. De igual manera para apagarlo, uno lo cambia a diesel. Para mas informacion visite: www.wvodesigns.com/wiki/Main_Page",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

I felt like I couldn't breath, talk, and I was very itchy. I went to the nurse and she said I was having an allergic reaction. Never having one before I panicked, that's how it all started. This continued for a year with the help of steroids I did well I thought. But on November 7, 2012 everything I thought I knew went out the window when I went into anaphylactic shock. These means that my throat was closing and despite the help of the doctors and nurses they couldn't stop it with the normal drugs. The had to intubate me to stop my throat from swelling shut. I was in a medically induced  coma  for five days. When I woke up I didn't know where I was, what had happened, or what day it was. At this time I was just months away from graduating from college; I had plans for after graduation, places I wanted to go, and what I wanted to do with my life. All of those plans went out the window, while I was trying to cope with losing all my plans, I was also trying to figure out how I was going to pay back college, pay for my medical bills, and live everyday without fear.

</div><p>Help me get back to acting</p><p> <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/explore?filter_city=Burbank&amp;filter_country=CTRY_US"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Burbank, California, United States</a>  <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/explore?filter_category=Health"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Health</a></p><p>My name is Walter Olkewicz and I've had the good fortune to be an actor for the past 40 years. I've done some 50 movies and over a 100 TV shows. That ended about 15 years ago with my first knee surgery. Infections cropped up over and over again to the tune of, to date, 19 surgeries and my living in a wheel chair the past ten years. Recently I was introduced to a doctor from Mexico who'd had great results with the treatment of infections. The shots I was given have been working and according to my surgeon the infections have been subsiding. The prayers of friends and family were finally answered. </p><p>The only problem is the injections and the care I've needed to continue- none of this is covered by insurance. I've depleted all of my savings and I simply can not afford to continue without help. Before this treatment started my doctor spoke of the very real possibility of having my leg amputated. Needless to say, this scared the bejesus out of me. After so many surgeries and this most welcome recent success, I simply can not even imagine not continuing. </p><p>Please Help!</p><p>  **** I'd like at this point to thank all who have helped. As most of you know this is the 2nd half of a campaign that started a couple of months ago. Although I only reached a bit less than 40% of my goal (explaining the need for this campaign), I have begun the treatments and have increased their frequency 200%!! The results are miraculous! Talk of amputation is at this point off the table. Though still a possibility it has gone from a 50/50 chance to less than a 5% chance. I can breathe easier. But now I need to <u>complete</u> the program which will reach into about a 6 month total. The shots both eradicate the infection AND (the more important part right now) build the cells and revive a leg that hasn't been used much in the past 12-15 years. Two months ago it was like trying to walk on a wet noodle. As my leg builds strength (currently at bread stick status), it will eventually- with a shipload of hard work- return to most of the strength I had in the leg 20 years ago.  Part of my ""Goal"" calculations include work with a physical trainer. Luckily some of that IS covered by insurance. Insurance covers 8 times per 3-month period, I need work with a trainer 5+ times a week.Not an easy path, but one I can dedicate myself to. Thanks to all of you.<br/></p><p>Over the first 30 years of my blessed career I was known for helping people (In the ten years that I ran my theater- The Jewel Box- over half of my students were there on ""Scholarships"" because they simply could not afford to come to class otherwise). I have coached fellow actors, people on the set, pretty much anybody I was lucky enough to work with for free, just trying to give back some of the good fortune I'd been lucky enough to receive. </p><p>Now I find it time to ask for help. </p><p>The estimated cost of these injections, the travel involved with obtaining them, and the personal care I need in the time until I am walking and ""on my feet"" again is about fifty thousand dollars (that figure might seem high until you consider that the hospital and doctor bills that <i>were</i> covered by insurance is nearly half a million)</p><p>True ""Hope"" is finally in my heart again. And being the creative animal that I am thoughts for a new theater keep me awake at night. I <i>will</i> make it happen! You can't imagine how frustrating something like persistent knee infections can be in blocking this dream. It would be like Picasso not being able to paint because he is in court fighting overdue traffic tickets. Okay, it's not exactly the same but you get the idea. </p><p>Over the past few years I have had lots of hospital time to read and study the great spiritual thinkers. I've come to understand that my ideas for an uplifting, inspiring theater are a direct result of me connecting with my Divine Purpose. I don't want that to sound egotistical or ""highfalutin"", you see <i>each of us</i> has a Divine Purpose. I've just been lucky enough to finally understand mine.  </p><p>So anyone generous enough to contribute, I will gladly include you in our opening audience at ""Up On Stage"", my new theater. </p><p>Sooo....</p><p>Anybody who <i>contributes $25  </i>gets an autographed picture of me from whatever work of mine they most like (or a copy of my knee X-rays if you are goofy enough for <i>that </i>to be more appealing to you). I apologize for the levity, but I learned a while ago that if I can't laugh at all this I am in real trouble. </p><p>For $50 dollars you will get four tickets to my first weeks opening - copies of my knee X-rays will be distributed at the door. </p><p><i>And</i> for a $100 dollars or more you will get an autograph picture, four tickets to opening week, and my son will come over and mow your lawn.  Okay he is probably too busy to do that. If you call me I'll give you my advice on how to make your lawn greener by using paper machete mulch. </p><p>Thank you very much for even reading this request.

I've done some 50 movies and over a 100 TV shows. That ended about 15 years ago with my first knee surgery. Infections cropped up over and over again to the tune of, to date, 19 surgeries and my living in a wheel chair the past ten years. Recently I was introduced to a doctor from Mexico who'd had great results with the treatment of infections. The shots I was given have been working and according to my surgeon the infections have been subsiding. The prayers of friends and family were finally answered. The only problem is the injections and the care I've needed to continue- none of this is covered by insurance. I've depleted all of my savings and I simply can not afford to continue without help. Before this treatment started my doctor spoke of the very real possibility of having my leg amputated. Needless to say, this scared the bejesus out of me. After so many surgeries and this most welcome recent success, I simply can not even imagine not continuing. Please Help!  **** I'd like at this point to thank all who have helped. As most of you know this is the 2nd half of a campaign that started a couple of months ago. Although I only reached a bit less than 40% of my goal (explaining the need for this campaign), I have begun the treatments and have increased their frequency 200%!! The results are miraculous! Talk of amputation is at this point off the table. Though still a possibility it has gone from a 50/50 chance to less than a 5% chance. I can breathe easier. But now I need to complete the program which will reach into about a 6 month total. The shots both eradicate the infection AND (the more important part right now) build the cells and revive a leg that hasn't been used much in the past 12-15 years. Two months ago it was like trying to walk on a wet noodle. As my leg builds strength (currently at bread stick status), it will eventually- with a shipload of hard work- return to most of the strength I had in the leg 20 years ago.  Part of my ""Goal"" calculations include work with a physical trainer. Luckily some of that IS covered by insurance. Insurance covers 8 times per 3-month period, I need work with a trainer 5+ times a week.Not an easy path, but one I can dedicate myself to. Thanks to all of you.Over the first 30 years of my blessed career I was known for helping people (In the ten years that I ran my theater- The Jewel Box- over half of my students were there on ""Scholarships"" because they simply could not afford to come to class otherwise). I have coached fellow actors, people on the set, pretty much anybody I was lucky enough to work with for free, just trying to give back some of the good fortune I'd been lucky enough to receive. Now I find it time to ask for help. The estimated cost of these injections, the travel involved with obtaining them, and the personal care I need in the time until I am walking and ""on my feet"" again is about fifty thousand dollars (that figure might seem high until you consider that the hospital and doctor bills that were covered by insurance is nearly half a million)True ""Hope"" is finally in my heart again. And being the creative animal that I am thoughts for a new theater keep me awake at night. I will make it happen! You can't imagine how frustrating something like persistent knee infections can be in blocking this dream. It would be like Picasso not being able to paint because he is in court fighting overdue traffic tickets. Okay, it's not exactly the same but you get the idea. Over the past few years I have had lots of hospital time to read and study the great spiritual thinkers. I've come to understand that my ideas for an uplifting, inspiring theater are a direct result of me connecting with my Divine Purpose. I don't want that to sound egotistical or ""highfalutin"", you see each of us has a Divine Purpose. I've just been lucky enough to finally understand mine.  So anyone generous enough to contribute, I will gladly include you in our opening audience at ""Up On Stage"", my new theater. Sooo....Anybody who contributes $25  gets an autographed picture of me from whatever work of mine they most like (or a copy of my knee X-rays if you are goofy enough for that to be more appealing to you). I apologize for the levity, but I learned a while ago that if I can't laugh at all this I am in real trouble. For $50 dollars you will get four tickets to my first weeks opening - copies of my knee X-rays will be distributed at the door. And for a $100 dollars or more you will get an autograph picture, four tickets to opening week, and my son will come over and mow your lawn.  Okay he is probably too busy to do that. If you call me I'll give you my advice on how to make your lawn greener by using paper machete mulch. Thank you very much for even reading this request. Please understand that despite any frivolity this is a most serious situation. My life and future career depend on it. Financial times being what they are, if you can't contribute yourself, I hope you will be willing to spread the word of my situation to your personal contacts. I believe we are all here on this planet to help each other. I hope you agree. And I hope you will consider my plight worthy of your generosity.

<p>Over the years, I've learned many recipes from many cultures. To reproduce most on a commercial basis, it's very expensive and often quite competitive. One thing I learned how to make many years ago is the traditional Mexican Cajeta, an ""over-the-top"", caramel sauce made with goat milk.</p>
<p>There are very few Cajeta makers in the US. It's a most time-consuming process as the milk/sugar combination must be cooked for about 4 hours, and it's best made with the raw goat milk, something not readily available in most back yards.</p>
<p>Living in SW Utah, we are surrounded by a Latino population, who currently are limited to purchasing one flavor of Cajeta at Walmart. They tell me it's just not the real thing. Several have been taste testing for us and are very anxious to purchase our product.</p>
<p>Of course, our ""gringo"" friends are also hooked on the sweet stuff and are asking to purchase it.</p>
<h3>
<br/>The nitty-gritty details.</h3>
<p>We are funding this project through various methods. We are putting in money from our market sales. That includes money from the sale of our lambs, Certified Organic produce, and live goats (for pets, breeders, and meat).</p>
<p>We are here at Indigogo doing ""step funding"". This project is to help us with getting the licensing so we can produce and sell the product. Because we are using raw goat milk, our product must undergo some special testing, including an AW test. The purpose of that test is to determine the water activity. If we can keep the AW &gt;.85, then the Cajeta will be considered ""shelf stable"".</p>
<p>For this second phase (the first was to perfect the recipe and the process, self-funded),  we are seeking funds to purchase proper testing equipment, and to pay for the cost of sending samples to Utah State University where the Cajeta will be tested, and to pay for the actual cost of testing and the cost of the annual product licesnse.</p>
<p>To be precise, and consistent with the Cajeta, we need to purchase a couple of Brix meters for high sugar content. Yes, there's a big fat name for them. Each one costs about $85. The reason we need to is that they fall out of calibration, and we want to have one in good working order at all times.</p>
<p>The cost of preparing and sending appropriate samples to from Beryl, UT to Logan, UT is approximately $60.</p>
<p>The cost of testing could be as high as $800, depending upon how many different tests must be performed.</p>
<p>Creating and printing our inital lalels is expected to cost about $300.</p>
<p>Additional funding is to purchase ingredients including cane sugar, Mexican Vanilla, and Cinnamon, and jars w/lids and rings.</p>
<p>When you help us with this, you get jars of our product, invitations to visit the farm, the opportunity to personalize our commercial kitchen, or to have a variation of the Tradtitional Cajeta named for you (after you come and help us invent it).</p>
<p>Now,should we be so unfortunate as to not reach our goal, we'll use the funds first for the refractometers, then for sending the samples to Utah State, then to help pay for testing and labels.  We continue to add our own personal capital to the project as well as a portion of the gross profits from our other farm operations.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>We are working hard to create a wonderful product which has been a part of the Latino community for hundreds of years. This is a product that few people can make at home. Sure, they can easily make the dulce de leche, which is made from cow's milk, but it's not as complex, satisfying, and fun to eat.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We know from market surveys that the demand is much higher than the supply. Fellow Cajeta makers around the US tell me they can't make enough to satisfy their local markets.</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p><b><a href=""http://www.thewheelmill.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Wheel Mill</a></b> is Pittsburgh's first indoor bike park, and we opened to the public this April. We are housed inside a building the size of an entire city block, 80,000sf, with two floors of riding. We have mountain bike and BMX trails, jumps, ramps, etc, for all ages and skill levels. We still have more to build though, and a pump track is one of the most universally ride-able features out there. But let's back up a minute and tell you a little about ourselves.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/127943/files/20131011125927-IMG_0639_cropped.jpg?1381521567"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Who is The Wheel Mill?</b> The Wheel Mill is owned by me, Harry Geyer, and my wife Sheila. My father loves bikes and took me on my first bike tour when I was 5 years old in Germany. We went 17 kilometers around town. I was hooked. Since then I've raced BMX, road, and mountain bikes, but mostly I just mess around for fun or commute. I love riding our local single track, and the BMX crew here is teaching me how to jump (Heck yeah!).</p>

<b>Who built The Wheel Mill?</b> Lot's of people, but the bulk of the credit goes to Mike and Mark Potoczny. They designed the now famous ""Woods Jump Room"" and the flowy ""Park Room"". We were also fortunate to have the legendary  Burly Matt Gibeaut help with the odd angles and bowl corners. Honorable mentions must go out to Josh Pekich,Tom Arkus, Brian Yeagle, Ryan Popple, and Jay Scott for their vision and hammer swinging. I also enlisted carpenters from my construction company to help keep things moving. That far from covers everyone, but you'll have to wait for the acceptance speech for the rest of the names, haha. <br/>

<b>So, what's a Pump Track? </b>A pump track is a course made up of a series of rollers and berms. When a pump track is properly designed, no pedaling is required to propel you and your bike forward. With a pumping motion you create all of the speed you need.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/127963/files/20131011130518-pump_track_rendering_1.1.jpg?1381521918"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>Who can use a Pump Track?</b> Anyone! That's the beauty of it. You can do it on a road bike, full suspension mountain bike, or a BMX bike, anything. What matters is that we build it right and you learn how to pump. Your wheels never need to leave the ground, but as your skill level increases you can get more creative with the lines and even turn the rollers into jumps!<br/>

<br/>
</div>
<div>

<h4>Risks and challenges</h4>
<p>Like every other feature in the park, we are going for something more with our pump track, and that means getting out of the comfort zone, out of the tried and true. When you explore new territory, you take all of your knowledge and experience and apply it to an idea or concept that is untested up to that point. <br/>The goal of building this pump track isn't to make it look exactly like the drawing, the goal is to make it the best riding pump track out there, and that may mean some tweaking along the way. <br/>This is the same process that has worked so well for every other room we have built. Take experienced riders with creative ideas, account for the constraints of the physical space, put that into a plan, get experienced builders to make it real, test it as you go, tweak it until its right, and there you have it! <br/>One of our biggest challenges is incorporating the BMX start gate and sprint lane into the first leg of the course. The second biggest challenge is making a turnaround that allows you to do multiple, uninterrupted laps. These areas may need to be built and rebuilt in order to get them right. The same could be said for any part of the track, really. In the end, you'll be riding on the best track that could be built in the space!</p></span></span></span></div>","The weather is about to take a turn for the worse, but that's no reason to stick your bike in storage! What if you could come out of the winter not only with your fitness and sanity in tact, but as a better rider as well? 
How is this possible you say? If you haven't already ridden an indoor bike park, do yourself a favor and get to the nearest one and prepare for the ride of your life! 


The Wheel Mill is Pittsburgh's first indoor bike park, and we opened to the public this April. We are housed inside a building the size of an entire city block, 80,000sf, with two floors of riding. We have mountain bike and BMX trails, jumps, ramps, etc, for all ages and skill levels. We still have more to build though, and a pump track is one of the most universally ride-able features out there. But let's back up a minute and tell you a little about ourselves.


Who is The Wheel Mill? The Wheel Mill is owned by me, Harry Geyer, and my wife Sheila. My father loves bikes and took me on my first bike tour when I was 5 years old in Germany. We went 17 kilometers around town. I was hooked. Since then I've raced BMX, road, and mountain bikes, but mostly I just mess around for fun or commute. I love riding our local single track, and the BMX crew here is teaching me how to jump (Heck yeah!).



Who built The Wheel Mill? Lot's of people, but the bulk of the credit goes to Mike and Mark Potoczny. They designed the now famous ""Woods Jump Room"" and the flowy ""Park Room"". We were also fortunate to have the legendary  Burly Matt Gibeaut help with the odd angles and bowl corners. Honorable mentions must go out to Josh Pekich,Tom Arkus, Brian Yeagle, Ryan Popple, and Jay Scott for their vision and hammer swinging. I also enlisted carpenters from my construction company to help keep things moving. That far from covers everyone, but you'll have to wait for the acceptance speech for the rest of the names, haha. 





If you want to see what it takes to build a room full of ramps then check out this time lapse of the Woods Jump Room:





So, what's a Pump Track? A pump track is a course made up of a series of rollers and berms. When a pump track is properly designed, no pedaling is required to propel you and your bike forward. With a pumping motion you create all of the speed you need.






Who can use a Pump Track? Anyone! That's the beauty of it. You can do it on a road bike, full suspension mountain bike, or a BMX bike, anything. What matters is that we build it right and you learn how to pump. Your wheels never need to leave the ground, but as your skill level increases you can get more creative with the lines and even turn the rollers into jumps!






How will the money be used? Our biggest single expense in building a pump track is materials. We will use approximately $9000 in plywood, studs, and hardware. Our next biggest expense is labor. We are setting aside $7000 to pay the best builders around to turn our concept into reality. The last expense is for our Scholarship Program. We need to pay the instructors and cover the additional insurance costs for running extra camps, and we are setting aside $2000 for that.

<h3> *MARLIE IS 7 MONTHS INTO HER BATTLE WITH CANCER.  DOCTORS ADVISE SHE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 2 MORE YEARS FIGHTING.  WE NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET.  WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL DONATIONS BIG OR SMALL.  EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS!*</h3>
<p>This is the story of Marlie Dowe D’Andrade, the 2 year old daughter of Shelley and Sean and her battle with leukemia. The following is an account of some of the many challenges Marlie and her family face daily, as related by her mother:<br/><br/>To give a very slight glimpse into what life has been for the past 8 months: <br/>Twice, we have been in the ICU with Marlie close to death. The first time was when she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The day she was diagnosed she received chemo in her spinal fluid, a bone marrow test, lumbar puncture, hemoglobin, platelet transfusions and had surgery to put a pick line in her chest. This was followed by 3 days of steroids in the Intensive Care Unit and then a course of chemo. She contracted mouth sores as a side effect from the chemo and had severe damage to her skin on her chest from a reaction to the dressings over her pick line. Due to her mouth sores, the need for transfusions, infections and fevers, we ended up living in the hospital for 40 days. <br/>After this first stay we were home for about a week and then back in the hospital for another 10 days while Marlie received her next phase of chemo. Then we had another break for a few weeks before going to the Oncology Clinic weekly. During one of our visits, her pick line was accessed and when they flushed the line it brought bacteria directly into her heart and blood stream. Within an hour Marlie went from a happy playful child to a little girl in the emergency room, septic, close to death, with numerous doctors and nurses working to stabilize her. She had emergency surgery to remove the pick line and replace it with a port. We ended up staying in the hospital for 2 weeks while Marlie fought the infection and started the next phase of chemo. This phase included 2 weekly sedations, lumbar punctures with chemo injected into her nervous system for 3 weeks. <br/>Life with a child with ALL is very hard, we are constantly monitoring her temperature because a fever could mean an infection, and when her counts are down, it can be fatal. There is also a chance that due to her weekly leg needles she receives she could get a blood clot (30% of children do), and because of the different meds she is on, her bones could also lose density and be more prone to damage. When her counts are low and she is neutrapenic, (about 50% of the time), she cannot go out in public, we cannot have visitors unless they are perfectly healthy adults, and it is strongly recommended that no children visit Marlie. <br/>After she receives her weekly leg needles, she is usually lethargic, whiny, clingy and generally feeling awful for a few days. Every third week she receives a list of chemo through her port line. This chemo makes her feel sick, and gives her extremely painful mouth sores. Our little girl can hardly eat for a week and ends up on morphine to control her pain. Every time Doctors access her port there is the fear that she will go septic again due to bacteria being forced back into her blood stream. <br/>During the weeks when our daughter receives chemo and goes on steroids, life is even more difficult. She is in constant pain for a week to 10 days, crying, saying it hurts, whining, clinging, lethargic, and is awake all day and night. <br/>Another side effect from her chemo, she has issues with her legs. She has pain, pins and needles and cannot lift her left foot properly when walking. When her legs are bothering her, she can’t tell us exactly what the issue is (because of her age) or where it hurts but she will grab her leg and start crying. She will be fine for a few days, and then all of a sudden, she will be limping and holding her leg or her leg will collapse. <br/>Marlie is an incredible little girl. Even at her worse, she tries very hard to play and be engaged in daily life. When we were first in the hospital, her legs were very weak from not walking and from chemo. Even though she was very weak and tired, we would go for daily walks around the hospital with her pushing a baby walker. She became very well known throughout the ward because she would wave and talk to all of the other kids as we passed their rooms. <br/>At the clinic, she is known for trying food from all of the other kids, hugging, and being involved in any games going on. She loves to collect her bravery beads and accosts the Child Life Worker as soon as she sees her to get her most recent beads. She loves dancing, being chased, and even when she is feeling awful, she wants to be taken to the park to swing. She insists on being ""in charge"" of the adults when we are playing games and makes sure everyone gets involved and has a turn. Marlie's positive energy helps us get through some very difficult days. Her humor and giggles are contagious, and her snuggles and hugs are the most heartwarming thing in our day. <br/>Marlie continues treatment, one day at a time, at home with her parents and at McMaster’s Children’s Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario Canada.</p>
<p>Please help us take the financial stress away while Marlie’s family work on getting their little girl better. <br/>Every little bit counts, if you cannot donate, please help us spread the word of Marlie’s charity by emailing or posting our link online:  <a href=""http://igg.me/p/239490?a=1412931"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://igg.me/p/239490?a=1412931</a></p>

She will be fine for a few days, and then all of a sudden, she will be limping and holding her leg or her leg will collapse. Marlie is an incredible little girl. Even at her worse, she tries very hard to play and be engaged in daily life. When we were first in the hospital, her legs were very weak from not walking and from chemo. Even though she was very weak and tired, we would go for daily walks around the hospital with her pushing a baby walker. She became very well known throughout the ward because she would wave and talk to all of the other kids as we passed their rooms. At the clinic, she is known for trying food from all of the other kids, hugging, and being involved in any games going on. She loves to collect her bravery beads and accosts the Child Life Worker as soon as she sees her to get her most recent beads. She loves dancing, being chased, and even when she is feeling awful, she wants to be taken to the park to swing. She insists on being ""in charge"" of the adults when we are playing games and makes sure everyone gets involved and has a turn. Marlie's positive energy helps us get through some very difficult days. Her humor and giggles are contagious, and her snuggles and hugs are the most heartwarming thing in our day. Marlie continues treatment, one day at a time, at home with her parents and at McMaster’s Children’s Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario Canada.
Please help us take the financial stress away while Marlie’s family work on getting their little girl better. Every little bit counts, if you cannot donate, please help us spread the word of Marlie’s charity by emailing or posting our link online:  http://igg.me/p/239490?a=1412931",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Our mission:</strong></p>
<p>One of Choose Rain’s core missions is to provide velvety sweet rainwater and rainwater based products to global residents, businesses and visitors.  By offering a truly healthy and environmentally safe bottled rainwater drink, we will change the current guilt-ridden bottled water experience by making drinking bottled water on the go a “feel good” experience.  <strong>Choose Rain’s Healthy Drink Awareness Program</strong> will make a difference by offering our healthy, low-calorie alternative rainwater drink as a substitute for the high calorie drinks thrust upon our children by society.  Remove the sugar and make drinks healthy.  <strong>Education by example</strong> will be the key to change.  We hope others will follow our lead. </p>
<p><strong>How we do what we do:</strong></p>
<p>We capture pure rainwater, in Ormond Beach, FL and Freeport, Bahamas as it falls from the sky before it hits the ground and becomes contaminated <strong><em>(Saving the aquifer)</em></strong>.  Most bottled water companies spend millions of dollars removing the contaminants in a usually unsuccessful attempt to make it like rainwater again.  We throw away the first rainfall containing the dust and pollen.  We micro-filter the sweet rainwater and use ozone, ultraviolet light and magnetics before bottling it in our biodegradable and recyclable bottle that degrades in a landfill in three to five years instead of 500 to 1,000 years <strong><em>(Saving our landfills)</em></strong>.  Using ozone, ultraviolet light and magnetics eliminates the need for chlorine and is better for you than the competing waters <strong><em>(Saving your health)</em></strong>.  We add nothing to it!  We will have a worldwide impact.  Plans are already underway to build a global capture and distribution network to <strong>change the world one child at a time</strong> <strong>(Saving our children)</strong><em>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Choose Rain’s Healthy Drink Awareness Program</strong> is a project created by Choose Rain LLC.  Choose Rain LLC is building a facility in Ormond Beach, FL to capture rainwater from the sky, process it in a healthy manner without using chlorine and bottle it in a biodegradable and recyclable bottle.  A second rainwater bottling facility is being built in Freeport Bahamas.  We will be making our healthy bottled rainwater available to private individuals and businesses who wish to support our charitable initiative which is to provide pure fresh drinking water to school children.  Just recently, the Bahamian Prime Minister addressed the United Nations assembly and stated that 68 percent of Bahamians are suffering from chronic non-communicable diseases which include diabetes and hypertension and both of these diseases are associated with obesity.  Want to promote an Eco-friendly mission and provide a “Feel Good” product to curb the tide towards obesity and diabetes in the Bahamas and in the USA?   </p>
<p><strong>The Problem: Sugary Drinks Are a Major Contributor to the Obesity Epidemic.</strong></p>
<p>According to the Harvard School of Health, “two out of three adults and one out of three children in the United States are overweight or obese, and the nation spends an estimated $190 billion a year treating obesity-related health conditions. Rising consumption of sugary drinks has been a major contributor to the obesity epidemic. A typical 20-ounce soda contains 15 to 18 teaspoons of sugar and upwards of 240 calories. A 64-ounce fountain cola drink could have up to 700 calories. People who drink this “liquid candy” do not feel as full as if they had eaten the same calories from solid food and do not compensate by eating less.”</p>
<p>Sweet, sugary drinks contribute to this problem of childhood and adult obesity.  If we educate the children to drink fresh, zero calorie rainwater bottled without chlorine in our eco-friendly, biodegradable bottle, they will have a chance to reverse this trend.  Our rainwater based, naturally flavored fruit drinks sweetened with Stevia can replace the sugary drinks currently consumed at home and in schools by children and their parents.  </p>

result in preferable metabolic reactions throughout the body. Those chewing

<p></p>
<p>Shatila refugee camp in
Lebanon is one of the most over crowded refugee camps in the Middle East and is
currently overwhelmed with the dramatic influx of refugees fleeing Syria. 
Lebanon now has over one million Syrian refugees, according to a recent government estimate. Many have nowhere
to go, have few possessions and are struggling to survive.</p>
<p>Electricity supply in the camp averages about
3-4 hours a day.  All safe drinking water in the camp has to be purchased and there
is no adequate refuse collection system which has resulted in an infestation of
rats.  The whole camp poses a serious health risk to everyone living there.  Conditions in Shatila refugee camp can only be described as sub human.  </p>

Some of featured kids in our video have Down syndrome, ADD and Autism, because inclusion is very important for our company and our products.

 
Our creative process
Our team has researched for years, we have done tests with children and parents and we have created more than 50 prototypes. We received collaborations from specialists in the area of ​​oral health, design and business.Together we have co-created the best educational toothbrush!


 
We have worked with DMO design company to perfect and define our final product and product engineering and we manufactured our beta product with star rapid company.
 

Our company and our products have been recognised in Chile and also abroad for its innovation and inclusive design.






 
Risks and Challenges


Prior to the delivery of our product we have to certify our product. We need financial resources to start the paperwork which occasionally might delay our production process. On the other hand, shipping MOUTI overseas could eventually suffer complications with customs. However, we believe in our product and we want to assure you that we work hard to deliver the best to our clients at the earliest possible time.
 
This campaign represents a big step to achieve our first production line and for the world to meet the new educational experience of oral hygiene for children. We need your support.

Join us and let's do it together!

<li>GRASSROOTS BUZZ BUILDING: We like fizzy water and we like buzzy word of mouth so we will produce sampling events in
San Francisco, Mill Valley, Los Angeles and New York.</li>
<li>KEY HIRES: In addition to the team members already committed to supporting our vision, we need to hire experts in functional
beverage development, branding, fundraising (after this seed funding, it's time to do a full round!), and social entrepreneurship. As a cause driven
company, we are committed to working with individuals who share our commitment
to making products that improve children’s health and wellness.</li>

<p>If
we do not reach our funding goal, we will work with our Advisory Board to
determine where the funds raised can have the biggest ROI. For example, a
smaller production run, and a reduced number of R&amp;D sampling events.</p>

Childhood obesity has doubled in the past 30 years.
Experts believe that if the obesity rate continues,
     this generation could become the first in American history to live shorter
     lives than their parents.
1 in 3 kids will develop diabetes before they are an
     adult.
Research links high sugar consumption - particularly
     our nation's sugary drink addiction - to obesity and diabetes, as well as
     diseases like cancer.
When a child’s body is dehydrated, organ functioning is
     impaired - beginning with the brain, the digestive system, and the heart.
Drinking water is imperative to optimal health.



THE SOLUTION?Wonder Waters™ is the sugar drink alternative! It's yummy, bubbly, organic fruit infused sparkling water that will reduce children's sugar intake and keep our kids healthy, happy, and hydrated.
WONDER WATERS IS IDEAL FOR...          

THE IMPACT

Wonder Waters is poised to leverage the popularity of kids drinks…but we provide
the healthy alternative!

Wonder Waters will be USDA Certified Organic
Wonder Waters will be GMO Free
Wonder Waters will donate 1% of gross profits to children’s
     health organizations.

   

All of our artwork is made by Julia (7) and Ian (12) !


OUR
CAMPAIGN GOAL
Help us raise $50,000 to launch Wonder Waters! We will use your contributions
to:
MAKE WATER: Run our first production
batch.
GRASSROOTS BUZZ BUILDING: We like fizzy water and we like buzzy word of mouth so we will produce sampling events in
San Francisco, Mill Valley, Los Angeles and New York.
KEY HIRES: In addition to the team members already committed to supporting our vision, we need to hire experts in functional
beverage development, branding, fundraising (after this seed funding, it's time to do a full round!), and social entrepreneurship. As a cause driven
company, we are committed to working with individuals who share our commitment
to making products that improve children’s health and wellness.



If
we do not reach our funding goal, we will work with our Advisory Board to
determine where the funds raised can have the biggest ROI. For example, a
smaller production run, and a reduced number of R&D sampling events.
BUILDING ON SUCCESS We are already working with people who have built successful companies and we believe that our mission, and our team's experience, will be a winning combination.
The quantity (8 oz skinny aluminum can) will be small enough that children will be able to proudly finish their drink and feel good.
Americans spent $11 billion on bottled waters in 2011 and a 5% to 6% growth is expected in 2014 (BMG Inc., 2013)
Wonder Waters packaging will be based on fun, super hero characters that will inspire children to drink water. 
Wonder Waters will not contain any added citric acid, a common ingredient in kids' drinks and sodas, which is an extremely detrimental additive to children's developing teeth.

<p>Today, one of the <b>biggest questions parents are asking</b> around the world is on the <b>topic of vaccinations</b>. </p>
<p>There are many polarizing voices out there; leaving many parents feeling confused about what to do. Legislation is being passed around the globe to move people towards vaccine compliance as the anti-vaccine movement grows and first world countries are primed for preventable outbreaks.</p>
<p>Science has advanced us into understanding more about biochemistry and genetics: <b>specifically in the area of methylation</b>.</p>
<p>We now know that almost half of the <b>4 million babies being born</b> in America every year have some form of a methylation disorder that is NOT addressed in a newborn inborn error of metabolism screening.</p>
<p><b>Healthy methylation is crucial</b> for conception and prenatal development through epigenetic regulation as well as childhood through adulthood health by reducing the risk for chronic, preventable diseases like heart disease, cancer, stroke and neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>That's why we developed Vax Support. Vax Support is an innovative, <b>first of its kind, dietary supplement</b> that ""hugs"" a child's methylation pathways, supporting their underlying biochemistry and providing parents peace of mind.</p>
<p>Vax Support is to be used as a daily supplement throughout childhood. Its intended use if for children 6 months of age to 18 years of age.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>

We created this company with a vision that chronic
disease will someday be a blip on the radar, not the staggering statistic today
that states that over 130 million people suffer from such. We also created this
company with the hope that vaccine preventable deaths will continue to be a
thing of the past and that the general population might feel more at ease in
vaccinating their children.
<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are super excited to bring Vax Support to every child, but there are intrinsic challenges in getting our product manufactured in a timely fashion to meet demands.  
We're working day in and day out to finalize our manufacturer to ensure the best fit for the highest-quality product. As we gear up for production, there will 
likely be minor changes and adjustments to improve the final formulation. We
 will keep you updated with any changes, and how or why they are 
implemented. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Tell your friends, family and loved ones about our product and help us spread the word! <br/><br/> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","Today, one of the biggest questions parents are asking around the world is on the topic of vaccinations. 
There are many polarizing voices out there; leaving many parents feeling confused about what to do. Legislation is being passed around the globe to move people towards vaccine compliance as the anti-vaccine movement grows and first world countries are primed for preventable outbreaks.
Science has advanced us into understanding more about biochemistry and genetics: specifically in the area of methylation.
We now know that almost half of the 4 million babies being born in America every year have some form of a methylation disorder that is NOT addressed in a newborn inborn error of metabolism screening.
Healthy methylation is crucial for conception and prenatal development through epigenetic regulation as well as childhood through adulthood health by reducing the risk for chronic, preventable diseases like heart disease, cancer, stroke and neurodegeneration.
That's why we developed Vax Support. Vax Support is an innovative, first of its kind, dietary supplement that ""hugs"" a child's methylation pathways, supporting their underlying biochemistry and providing parents peace of mind.
Vax Support is to be used as a daily supplement throughout childhood. Its intended use if for children 6 months of age to 18 years of age.




Methylation is a new, breakthrough concept that is crucial for overall health. Check out our animated video that explains methylation in an easy-to-understand manner.


Vax Support is a daily supplement that is designed to support methylation*. Vax Support will be a delicious orange-flavored liquid for children of all ages. We are using the highest standards in manufacturing to provide a quality, pure and effective product.Vax Support is free of casein, dairy, corn, egg, fish, gluten, wheat, peanuts, shellfish, soy and tree nuts. Vax Support is free of artificial sweeteners, colorings or flavorings.

</div><p></p><h3>The gym and the project</h3><div>Since 2007 I had a vision to set up a  rock climbing gym in Yerevan, so we would have a place to keep on climbing during winter season, as well to attract more people into climbing.  And finally, my friend Daniel Domingo supported my inspiration and we opened ""Boulder Town"" on Oct 2015 in downtown of Yerevan!<p></p>
<p>This was the greatest experience for rock climbing we ever had in Armenia. The efficiency of indoor climbing was obvious: youth who where already in climbing got significantly improved during this year, and the most important - more and more kids and youth came to try and got involved in Climbing Activity!</p>
<p>On the other hand the Armenian Alpine Club, which is a member federation of IFSC (International Federation of Sport Climbing) and UIAA, has counted on the gym where to prepare an Armenian National Climbing Teams (both for youth and adult), which would be representing Armenia in international competitions! </p>
<p>Initially, when with Daniel we were planning the project, we knew that rock climbing is very new in Armenia, we would start hard and won't get a benefit from this project, or even bring back the investment. We considered that even if the gym covers its monthly expenses then we just would be happy that it exists and we have an indoor place to climb! :)</p>
<p>But for some reasons it didn't, and we had to close the gym on past November, after a year of working..  But it's OK, we gained a LOT!!!  Now we have an experience of building, managing and running a climbing gym in Armenia! And thanks to this first step we already know the local specifics and how it must be done, for which we only need your excitement and support to our project!</p>
<p><i>P.S, this is the second laps of our IndieGogo campaign, during the first one we reached only 12%. </i></p>

<li>Rock climbing in Armenia is very new, especially as an indoor activity. But it must pass this natural period of enthusiasm and initiatives, after which indoor climbing will get popular and grown up! That shows the increasing feed back we have through fb messages and calls, people asking how can they come into our gym and about our conditions.</li>
<li>Lack of advertisement. We thought that a ""facebook group"" promotion would be enough as the most of youth hang out in internet today. We didn't even spend money to use fb ad service, thinking just tagging our visitors in pictures would be enough. But it was not, so we know that we must work properly on advertisement in general, as well to collaborate with schools and universities.</li>
<li>Small climbing surface (construction wall) and few climbing holds. The resources of our first step was merely enough to build a good climbing wall with overhanging and positive relief, although over 60sc/m is too small for the leisure visitors. As well very few 250 repetitive climbing holds get boring after 2-3 months climbing. So here is where we think the most of raised fund must go - for making the climbing wall larger around and on sealing, and to buy new climbing holds!</li>
<li>The high entrance fee. We had set up a flexible entrance fee: from 10.000 to 20.000 AMD for monthly fee and from 1.000 to 3.000 per day entrance. But the feed back from our visitors and from our social surveys showed that the entrance fee must be even less and more flexible, like 12.000 and 1.500 max for monthly and daily fees.   As well for stimulating the visits we will have a special day in a week to open the doors for visitors free of charge!</li>
</ol>How will we use the money you have donated<div>
<p>If we inspired you enough to get our claimed sum, then:</p>
<ol>
<li>The 8% + $25 will go for IndieGogo platform and bank transfer fees.</li>
<li>40% of the fund will go to climbing wall construction and crash pad (sponges &amp; blanket) expenses.</li>
<li>35% of the fund will go for buying and importing new climbing holds.</li>
<li>The 10% of the fund will go to assistant workers (the main constructing I (have done) and will do myself volunteering).</li>
<li>And around 7% will go to advertising campaign such as facebook ads, brochures, TV or radio ads. </li>

<b>What if we get more than we claimed? </b>It's fuckin amazing!!! we will have money to cover our regular expenses during first months such as: taxes, gym rent, salaries for gym manager and cleaner, communal expenses.

<h3>How can ""Boulder Town"" make Armenia better if it starts working again? </h3>
<p>The youth in Yerevan will have another option for amazing leisure, the kids will get involved in rock climbing and they will go for outdoors next. They will start to love and appreciate the nature of Armenia, they will take care of it.

The specialist Dr. Muaaz Tarabichi at the American Hospital in Dubai has confirmed the lack of hearing of 95% on both ears. The family of Haya Nazia came from Sri Lanka to Dubai, because the father found a small bank job there. There are 2 more sisters and brothers and the family wouldn't be able at all to pay the costs of the implants and the operations. But Haya Nazia is going to learn to speak and for this she would need to hear something. She should be operated in the first year of her life. Who could help?</span></h3>
<h2><span>Time is running so fast and we ask you respectfully to donate a small amount for Haya.</span></h2>
<p>Haya's father is a good friend of my husband and me. We are a German-Sri Lankan couple and know the family Jaldin personally. They would do all for their kids, but as a small employee in a bank it is absolutely impossible to finance those implants. The full amount for both ears would be around 120000 USD. A health insurance system is not available. The preliminary estimate form from the American Hospital in Dubai, the diagnosis and the letter of the father you can download here:</p>

<p> </p></div>","Small baby-girl Haya Nazia needs urgently cochlear-implants for both ears. The specialist Dr. Muaaz Tarabichi at the American Hospital in Dubai has confirmed the lack of hearing of 95% on both ears. The family of Haya Nazia came from Sri Lanka to Dubai, because the father found a small bank job there. There are 2 more sisters and brothers and the family wouldn't be able at all to pay the costs of the implants and the operations. But Haya Nazia is going to learn to speak and for this she would need to hear something. She should be operated in the first year of her life. Who could help?
Time is running so fast and we ask you respectfully to donate a small amount for Haya.
Haya's father is a good friend of my husband and me. We are a German-Sri Lankan couple and know the family Jaldin personally. They would do all for their kids, but as a small employee in a bank it is absolutely impossible to finance those implants. The full amount for both ears would be around 120000 USD. A health insurance system is not available. The preliminary estimate form from the American Hospital in Dubai, the diagnosis and the letter of the father you can download here:
http://www.ulme-mini-verlag.de/Haya_Jaldin_Coch....
The family would be happy about every contribution; if there would be a doctor, who could do the operation for free or a hospital, who could provide cheaper implants, please don't hesitate to contact us or the family itself.

<p>Suzanne was diagnosed with colon cancer last year. She almost died and had to have extensive surgery, including a colostomy.  She has had to undergo endless testing and treatment since then and now needs another operation.</p>
<p>Suzanne has no family.  She has not been able to work because she is so ill and she has depleted her savings during this long illness paying medical bills and living expenses. </p>
<p>I had posted a campaign last month in an attempt to keep Suzanne in her apartment.  The campaign was not successful in raising the money needed to keep her in her apartment, but then a miracle occurred and a neighbor stepped in to make up the difference to pay her rent for December. </p>
<p>Now I am posting, once again, to seek assistance for Suzanne to help to pay her rent &amp; utilities and to buy food for the next few months so she can make it through another surgery. To accomplish this, she needs money to keep her going as the surgery recovery will require a wound vac and 2 months of healing time.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help you could provide for her and I pray you can help her where I cannot. God bless you and thank you for reading this campaign.  I know my friend:  she is the most generous person I have ever met.  She has given so much of herself to helping others.  She works on non-profit projects, such as getting clean water to people who need it.  Now it is she that needs the help of others - a strange position for her to be in because she is usually the one doing the helping.  Please help my friend make it through this next operation so she can hopefully beat this cancer and get back to the business of doing what she loves the most:  helping other people.</p>

healthy mothers and healthy babies.  Governments, NGOs, and providers are
working around the world to ensure that every mother and baby survives
birth.  But more is at stake in pregnancy and childbirth than survival
alone.  When women are coming out of
childbirth with post-partum PTSD due to disrespect or abuse during labour, the goal of a “healthy
mother and healthy baby” has not been met.</p>
<p>The
care that women receive during pregnancy and childbirth intersects with the

What We DoHuman Rights in Childbirth works to promote the recognition of fundamental human rights in maternity care, both in law and practice. We connect individuals and organizations around the world who are advancing women’s rights in childbirth at a local level.  We create opportunities for collaboration at our conferences and other events.Our international network of lawyers and activists works towards strategic advocacy, and the development of Know-Your-Rights information, for distribution at the state or national level.  With our network coordinators, we are developing education courses and materials to increase relevant knowledge among birth attendants,  legal professionals, and consumers.Human Rights in Childbirth was formally established as a Dutch Stichting, or non-profit foundation, in 2013 (kvk number 58480609), and now has core team members working in both The Netherlands and Oregon in the US. Why Human Rights in Childbirth?Everybody working in maternity care shares a common goal:
healthy mothers and healthy babies.  Governments, NGOs, and providers are
working around the world to ensure that every mother and baby survives
birth.  But more is at stake in pregnancy and childbirth than survival
alone.  When women are coming out of
childbirth with post-partum PTSD due to disrespect or abuse during labour, the goal of a “healthy
mother and healthy baby” has not been met.
The
care that women receive during pregnancy and childbirth intersects with the
human rights to physical integrity, self-determination, privacy, health, family
life, and spiritual freedom. 
Women do
not lose their basic human rights once they become pregnant. And yet,
every day, we receive reports from women around the globe that their human
rights have been violated during childbirth. From denial of pain relief and support during labour to episiotomies, cesareans, and other interventions performed despite the mother’s
objection.
Women
should not be coerced into compliance, through threats that medical care will
be completely withheld or that their children will be taken away by social
services. Women should not have to travel across state and country borders to
find support in childbirth. And doctors and midwives should not be persecuted
for providing rights-based maternity care. 
We believe that much suffering can be prevented through the
clarification and upholding of the fundamental human rights of birthing women.  And we are committed to promoting those
rights, in law and practice, until they become a reality for birthing women
everywhere. 
Our Story
Our organization has grown out of the increasing concern of people – lawyers, doctors, ethicists, midwives, anthropologists, doulas, parents – from around the world, that there is a significant lack of recognition of the fundamental human right of birthing women to be respected as the final decision-maker about her own care and her baby’s care. The
conversation about the range and recognition of human rights at stake began in
The Hague in 2012, at our first conference. 
It developed through two more conferences in 2013, in the US and
Belgium.  Our next conference is planned
for India, and will convene leaders of maternity care in the global community
to determine how to eradicate inequality and ensure support for human rights in
maternity care worldwide.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Chana and Tova, two nurses, were seeking to help underprivileged communities when they stumbled upon Midwives for Haiti. Midwives for Haiti is an outstanding organization that trains local Haitians to become skilled birth attendants, helps staff the maternity center at the nearby hospital and manages a mobile clinic that provides pre-and post-natal care in 19 different locations.</p>
<p>At the hospital, running water becomes intermittent, and there is a severe shortage of basic materials, as well as limited electricity, which makes it difficult to provide care. There are neonatal deaths and high-risk mothers on a regular basis. There is very little oxygen available in the hospital. There are no means to save premature babies. Some weeks, between 2 and 6 babies die, mostly from prematurity but sometimes from other causes.</p>
<p>We just had to go. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Basically, we could really use your donation (Please?). </p>
<p>We need to cover the cost of our tickets to and from Haiti, the 3-hour drive from the airport in Port-au-Prince to Hinche (on a dirt road!) where the hospital is located, room and board, our own supplies, and translators to help us communicate with the local women and midwives.</p>
<p>The $4,000 price tag covers the minimum essentials, but extra funds will go toward direly needed basic supplies and medications that we will purchase and bring with us, such as gloves, hand sanitizer, thermometers, Tylenol, batteries, etc.</p>
<p>We have a longer list of supplies needed in Haiti. If you are in a position to make a supply donation, please contact us directly at <a href=""mailto:chanalewis@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">chanalewis@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>Any amount is tremenously appreciated. Even a little goes a long way.</p>

<p>I

wood that is being wasted in the manufacturing process of temples and wooden soaking

<p><b>About Hinoki</b></p>
<p>The Japanese have known for centuries of the relaxing, calming &amp;
healing properties of Hinoki wood.  All
of the temples in Japan are constructed of Hinoki wood as well as the (Ofuros)
soaking tubs. It is used in essential oils for healing and in health care
products.  <span>Oils in
the bark produce phytocide properties for healing including: creating a calmative
effect, relieving insomnia, eliminating parasites, and killing viruses, Candida,
and invasive bacteria. </span>The product is
environmentally friendly ~ specially crafted from the recovered by-product of
the Hinoki wood manufacturing process. It is 100% natural and m<span>ade in Japan.</span></p>
<p><b>The Impact &amp; Product</b></p>
<p>My
goal is to help as many people as possible to learn about using Hinoki as a
natural and holistic product for health issues, especially for reducing stress
and insomnia. This approach is natural and much better than using synthetic
medications.  The Hinoki bath ~ Be-Bags ™
can help relieve stress and insomnia by either sleeping with a bag under your
pillow case or using it in a bath. Each Be-Bag can be used for 4 baths.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Lawrence Mark and I am the Inventor of the Lovers' Dream and majority shareholder of Blue Dreams Global Inc. &amp; Blue Dreams Co. Ltd. I have always had an experimental, adventurous, open-minded and fun loving attitude to making love. I had an experience in 2001 while having fun in bed playing around with my girlfriend at the time, which was incredible for both of us.</p>
<p>This experience led me to invent the first prototype of the Lovers' Dream. That was the beginning of many years  of challenges, accomplishments and ongoing improvements to create the perfect product which simultaneously enhances and heightens the love making experience for couples at the same time. I am grateful to all of my  loving friends who helped to balance the scales in my favour always. Blue Dreams has been granted Patents in all of the major global territories and we are about to share my DREAM with everyone all over the World. </p>
<p></p>
<b>Why I need your help :</b>
</div><p><span>From the inception of this idea, it’s been a taboo.  My associates, most of my friends and some of my family do not even want to discuss it because of the nature of this business of sex. </span>One of my sisters says I will go straight to hell.  My eldest brother will not even discuss it.  My mother laughs at it now, but it wasn’t a laughing matter to her ten years ago.</p><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I did not have the money when I got the idea, and I still don’t have all of the money we need now.  I have had to form a company so that I could assign the patents to the company, so that my friends, could feel some kind of security when they invested their money in my idea and me.</span><br/><p></p>
<p><span>I have had friends put up security<span>, even put up their house to the Bank and the Bank blatantly refused because of the nature of this business.  I have struggled all through these years piece by piece putting this puzzle together.  On many occasions I gave up only to wake up the next morning on fire again to keep this project going</span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Blue Dream Global Inc. has now achieved most of its objectives and passed many milestones.  We are at the stage of pre-production in the factory right now. </span></p>
<p><span>I am reaching out to all of you to please be part of this amazing journey by helping me fund the first production run..</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Any support that you choose to give me would be greatly appreciated. Please share in my Dream to bring joy, heightened excitement, increasing pleasure and closer bonds to couples all over the world.</span></p>

<p><b>Note from the Design-Engineering Team...</b></p></span>
<p>In late April of 2014, our design team engaged with Lawrence and the product began to take shape.  A very detail-oriented person, Lawrence was actively involved and using a variety of custom online collaboration tools the design team work remotely with Lawrence to define and steer the product direction.</p>
<p>The combined team of designers, electronic/mechanical engineers and commercialization staff dug in and worked closely ensuring Lawrence’s vision of the product was maintained.  The Bill of Materials was scrutinized as the<b> </b>team worked to remove cost where feasible with Lawrence being ever vigilant that quality was maintained.</p>
<p>A fully functioning prototype was fabricated, tested and forwarded to Lawrence and his investor team.  The reaction was incredible! This was the a-ha moment they were able to touch the very first completely working  'Lovers Dream' and a product was born. </p>
<p>Minor refinements to the product were implemented as the learning from the prototype led to revision to the intense pleasure vibration modes, final fit to body shape and ease of assembly. For successful products, the combination of design, engineering and manufacturing in one studio really accelerates the design process.  The in-house manufacturing support team went to work with Lawrence to develop relationships with proven quality suppliers that would turn on the high volume production. </p>
<p>As you read this it is likely that the first units are rolling off the production  line.   The team will evaluate, recommend and implement any last refinements that are identified and yes... to celebrate a little bit.  No doubt some user testing will occur!!!</p>
<p>We look forward to the next step in the process - a full production launch in the very near future.</p>
<p>On a personal note, we have come to know this product and Lawrence very well.  We spoke often over many months exploring the opportunity to work together.  On one Friday evening we talked for over an hour, remotely and in two different locations, worlds apart, both parties with wine in hand, long before we ever worked together.  Lawrence and his business team had to overcome numerous obstacles and never wavered from their vision. Our role as the creative implementers is to steer Lawrence through the physical hardware product development and find the perfect solution to his vision. </p>
<p>We are extremely proud of the achievement.  We know the market will love this product.  This is not the end, but rather the beginning.  We invite you to join us in this journey.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Lawrence Mark and the business team at Blue Dreams. </p>
<p>This product is a winner!</p>

<p><b>Michael Bassett, Adult Novelty and Pleasure Product Industry Expert</b></p>
</span>
<p>When I first heard of the Lovers' Dream I was very impressed! When I learnt more, I was convinced and wanted to be part of the team! For several years now, there has been little real innovation in adult pleasure product. Sure, there are a few highlights here and there but nothing that really jumps out at you as a major game changer!   “The Lovers' Dream is a ‘real’ game changer”that will come in many shapes, sizes, colors and varieties of electronic configurations. There are 2 more distinctly different products under the same concept and patents, to follow, that will also be shared with the World in time.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There are a plethora of vibrators and massagers on the market, predominantly used for female solo play and this arena is heavily saturated.  By its very nature, being a couple’s product, the Lovers' Dream will gain mass mainstream attention.  We have seen first hand the success of other couples devices, well constructed items made with attention to detail, materials, ergonomics and reliability. The couples market for adult product is lucrative due to its size and its acceptance of a mutual sexual aid. Couples who have been together for some time, females who have had children- this is a sizeable global audience with a combined and established disposable income and many of these will purchase this product.  This isn’t marketing hype, I know it, as I’ve sold millions of dollars of such items for many years.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Lovers' Dream has all the right elements. It has a smooth body safe silicon shell, it’s phthalate free, is rechargeable, has 3 vibrating motors, it looks great and is designed for use by couples during penetration whilst providing clitoral stimulation. It provides a sense of being fulfilled in every way for both parties whilst offering simultaneous orgasm. As a bonus, if desired, it can be rotated and used also for anal play. It is a Lovers' Dream!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The global potential in terms of sales of this product is enormous. It will be sold in every country in the world that doesn’t prohibit the sales of adult pleasure product and with the proliferation of adult product and awareness via ecommerce and social media, it will reach even the most distant places quite swiftly.  The Lovers’ Dream will bring pleasure, and pleasure back, to many couples and lovers all over the world.</p>

</div>

<p>We estimate we require at least US$75,000 to fund production, packaging, freight and warehousing plus the entire sales process including trade show and booth costs, travel, accommodation and sales staff. Once we've made our first sales and revenue is flowing, our cash flow situation will improve but we must first get through the first tough 6 months of business establishment.  We're confident we have a very special and unique product and we are well protected with patents plus we have the relevant industry experienced personnel on board!</p>

<p>The 12 month Beta testing program for US$500- $600 is a real treat and we can't wait to have you closely involved. This is very special and you will work closely with our product development teams.</p>
<p>AND for $5,000 you'll be traveling to a US or European ADULT INDUSTRY TRADE SHOW and having us show you around, accommodation and spending money,  well that is VERY special indeed! This is a unique opportunity to see first hand, the global adult pleasure product industry from the inside!</p>

<p>One current challenge is the depressed state of our global economies.

<p>As we also have many more products in the pipeline, the Lovers' Dream will experience product extension and there will be a family of wonderful pleasure products further enhancing our footprint in retail and online.</p>

The specially shaped bullet tip can be placed either on the clitoral area or in the anal position, and the bulb is designed to keep the product in, and massage him at the same time. Lovers' Dream delivers out of this world stimulation for both partners simultaneously and that is the key to the Lovers' Dream, it is a genuine lovers product for couples to use together to create more intimacy and a deeper connection ….
However, if so desired, the Lovers' Dream is perfect for solo play. There is truly nothing else like the Lovers' Dream.

We love our two colors. The Lovers' Dream will be available in both Sky Blue and Vivid Purple.









We have been self-funded up to this point, but not for the production of the first 5,000 units. We've secured patents in the US, Canada, South Africa, Hong Kong, China, Australia, the EU, Brazil and India, registered companies, employed one of the best design and engineering companies and negotiated with the appropriate sales channel partners.
The manufacturing process has been approved and we have completed the molds and ordered all electronic components to start pilot run of the first 50 products off the manufacture's line for further quality control and testing.





Lawrence Mark : Founder / Inventor


Hi, my name is Lawrence Mark and I am the Inventor of the Lovers' Dream and majority shareholder of Blue Dreams Global Inc. & Blue Dreams Co. Ltd. I have always had an experimental, adventurous, open-minded and fun loving attitude to making love. I had an experience in 2001 while having fun in bed playing around with my girlfriend at the time, which was incredible for both of us.
This experience led me to invent the first prototype of the Lovers' Dream. That was the beginning of many years  of challenges, accomplishments and ongoing improvements to create the perfect product which simultaneously enhances and heightens the love making experience for couples at the same time. I am grateful to all of my  loving friends who helped to balance the scales in my favour always. Blue Dreams has been granted Patents in all of the major global territories and we are about to share my DREAM with everyone all over the World. 

Why I need your help :
From the inception of this idea, it’s been a taboo.  My associates, most of my friends and some of my family do not even want to discuss it because of the nature of this business of sex. One of my sisters says I will go straight to hell.  My eldest brother will not even discuss it.  My mother laughs at it now, but it wasn’t a laughing matter to her ten years ago.
I did not have the money when I got the idea, and I still don’t have all of the money we need now.  I have had to form a company so that I could assign the patents to the company, so that my friends, could feel some kind of security when they invested their money in my idea and me.
I have had friends put up security, even put up their house to the Bank and the Bank blatantly refused because of the nature of this business.  I have struggled all through these years piece by piece putting this puzzle together.  On many occasions I gave up only to wake up the next morning on fire again to keep this project going

Blue Dream Global Inc. has now achieved most of its objectives and passed many milestones.  We are at the stage of pre-production in the factory right now. 
I am reaching out to all of you to please be part of this amazing journey by helping me fund the first production run..

Any support that you choose to give me would be greatly appreciated. Please share in my Dream to bring joy, heightened excitement, increasing pleasure and closer bonds to couples all over the world.

Michael Bassett : Consultant




Michael Bassett, renowned Pleasure Product industry professional, has joined BDGI in a consulting capacity to guide the development and global marketing and sales of the Lovers' Dream.
Michael has recently stepped down after 6 years as CEO at Calvista, Australia’s largest importer and distributor of adult pleasure products. In this time of changing market conditions and recessive economies, he expanded Calvista’s product ranges and sales volumes and secured many exclusive and highly lucrative pleasure product sales agreements including the highly successful We-Vibe from Standard Innovation Corporation, Canada.  He is regarded as one of the few people in the world who were instrumental in the early sales success of this product and company. 
Prior to Calvista, Michael managed the German operations of the ecommerce adult retailer adultshop.com and later orchestrated its sale to one of Germany’s largest erotic conglomerates.
Fluent in German and English, with degrees in psychology, marketing and management, Bassett lived in Hamburg, in Germany’s north for 12 years and gained mainstream corporate expertise as Manager Europe, Middle East and Africa for Minolta’s hi tech 3D Division.






Note from the Design-Engineering Team...
In late April of 2014, our design team engaged with Lawrence and the product began to take shape.  A very detail-oriented person, Lawrence was actively involved and using a variety of custom online collaboration tools the design team work remotely with Lawrence to define and steer the product direction.
The combined team of designers, electronic/mechanical engineers and commercialization staff dug in and worked closely ensuring Lawrence’s vision of the product was maintained.  The Bill of Materials was scrutinized as the team worked to remove cost where feasible with Lawrence being ever vigilant that quality was maintained.
A fully functioning prototype was fabricated, tested and forwarded to Lawrence and his investor team.  The reaction was incredible! This was the a-ha moment they were able to touch the very first completely working  'Lovers Dream' and a product was born. 
Minor refinements to the product were implemented as the learning from the prototype led to revision to the intense pleasure vibration modes, final fit to body shape and ease of assembly. For successful products, the combination of design, engineering and manufacturing in one studio really accelerates the design process.  The in-house manufacturing support team went to work with Lawrence to develop relationships with proven quality suppliers that would turn on the high volume production. 
As you read this it is likely that the first units are rolling off the production  line.   The team will evaluate, recommend and implement any last refinements that are identified and yes... to celebrate a little bit.  No doubt some user testing will occur!!!
We look forward to the next step in the process - a full production launch in the very near future.
On a personal note, we have come to know this product and Lawrence very well.  We spoke often over many months exploring the opportunity to work together.  On one Friday evening we talked for over an hour, remotely and in two different locations, worlds apart, both parties with wine in hand, long before we ever worked together.  Lawrence and his business team had to overcome numerous obstacles and never wavered from their vision. Our role as the creative implementers is to steer Lawrence through the physical hardware product development and find the perfect solution to his vision. 
We are extremely proud of the achievement.  We know the market will love this product.  This is not the end, but rather the beginning.  We invite you to join us in this journey.
Congratulations to Lawrence Mark and the business team at Blue Dreams. 
This product is a winner!








Michael Bassett, Adult Novelty and Pleasure Product Industry Expert

When I first heard of the Lovers' Dream I was very impressed! When I learnt more, I was convinced and wanted to be part of the team! For several years now, there has been little real innovation in adult pleasure product. Sure, there are a few highlights here and there but nothing that really jumps out at you as a major game changer!   “The Lovers' Dream is a ‘real’ game changer”that will come in many shapes, sizes, colors and varieties of electronic configurations. There are 2 more distinctly different products under the same concept and patents, to follow, that will also be shared with the World in time.


There are a plethora of vibrators and massagers on the market, predominantly used for female solo play and this arena is heavily saturated.  By its very nature, being a couple’s product, the Lovers' Dream will gain mass mainstream attention.  We have seen first hand the success of other couples devices, well constructed items made with attention to detail, materials, ergonomics and reliability. The couples market for adult product is lucrative due to its size and its acceptance of a mutual sexual aid. Couples who have been together for some time, females who have had children- this is a sizeable global audience with a combined and established disposable income and many of these will purchase this product.  This isn’t marketing hype, I know it, as I’ve sold millions of dollars of such items for many years.


The Lovers' Dream has all the right elements. It has a smooth body safe silicon shell, it’s phthalate free, is rechargeable, has 3 vibrating motors, it looks great and is designed for use by couples during penetration whilst providing clitoral stimulation. It provides a sense of being fulfilled in every way for both parties whilst offering simultaneous orgasm. As a bonus, if desired, it can be rotated and used also for anal play. It is a Lovers' Dream!


The global potential in terms of sales of this product is enormous. It will be sold in every country in the world that doesn’t prohibit the sales of adult pleasure product and with the proliferation of adult product and awareness via ecommerce and social media, it will reach even the most distant places quite swiftly.  The Lovers’ Dream will bring pleasure, and pleasure back, to many couples and lovers all over the world.







We now need to fund the first production run of 5000 units at the Factory and have these packaged and ready for global distribution and sale.


We estimate we require at least US$75,000 to fund production, packaging, freight and warehousing plus the entire sales process including trade show and booth costs, travel, accommodation and sales staff. Once we've made our first sales and revenue is flowing, our cash flow situation will improve but we must first get through the first tough 6 months of business establishment.  We're confident we have a very special and unique product and we are well protected with patents plus we have the relevant industry experienced personnel on board!
The PERKS that we have constructed aim to give you the choice according to your desires, budget and geographical location. We hope you like them and that there is something suitable for you.  
The Early Bird VIP single and twin pack deals offer fantastic value at 45% - 50% off MSRP. You will be the first to receive the Lovers' Dream at a never to be repeated price.  You won't be able to buy these products retail at this price!
The 12 month Beta testing program for US$500- $600 is a real treat and we can't wait to have you closely involved. This is very special and you will work closely with our product development teams.
AND for $5,000 you'll be traveling to a US or European ADULT INDUSTRY TRADE SHOW and having us show you around, accommodation and spending money,  well that is VERY special indeed! This is a unique opportunity to see first hand, the global adult pleasure product industry from the inside!




All money raised will go toward funding production and getting the Lovers' Dream into the hands of loving couples world wide. Blue Dreams Global Inc. (BDGI) does have access to USD 300,000.00 if this campaign fails so those of you concerned about your perks not being honoured because of lack of campaign funds please don't concern yourself your perk is very safe with us.

  




One current challenge is the depressed state of our global economies. There just isn't as much discretionary income at our disposal as there was a few years ago, things are a lot tighter now for most consumers.  Fortunately, we have a killer product, its a premium pleasure item made from silicon, is rechargeable and used by couples for simultaneous pleasure and thus it has widespread appeal.  Our industry knowledge also informs us, its a very good time to release this product right now, the market is hungry for it and we have very strong expressions of interest from the industry.  
As we also have many more products in the pipeline, the Lovers' Dream will experience product extension and there will be a family of wonderful pleasure products further enhancing our footprint in retail and online.

 
  


Don't sweat it, we would however,  love it,  if you could help us spread the word and share our campaign with your friends and colleagues and please make use of the Indiegogo share tools!

Help us make something amazing!

<h3>Hello,</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I am Gerri's granddaughter, Brittany. I have decided to create a daily/weekly journal for updates regarding my grandmother's health. My goal in creating this is to start a growing prayer chain in honor of Gerri Montgomery. I want God's prayer warriors to fervently pray for the healing of such an amazing woman. <strong>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE include others in your praying for her!!</strong> It is very much appreciated and I know she is so thankful for you. This journal is solely based on her request for prayers.</p>
<p><strong>Let me explain... </strong>on July 17th of this year my grandmother went to the doctor for due to some bumps in her mouth that had been irritating her. It was after several appointments that she was diagnosed with Squamous cancer (oral cancer). After having a CT scan completed for her mouth, doctors happen to notice some spots appear on her upper right lung. Several appointments later, my grandmother was diagnosed with Stage 3 or Stage 4 (yet to be determined) lung cancer.</p>
<h3>What you can do:</h3>
<p>By living with my grandmother, I've learned so much. She once told me: ""God doesn't just help people that don't care. They have to have the 'want to' in them"". Now more than ever, I believe that. My 'want to' is steadfast, whole-hearted prayer for my grandma to circulate in this nation and within the world. <em><strong>Please remember her name when you're talking to God.</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you and God bless you. I will post more updates as soon as they come.</p>

That is USD 164. 3 x 3 = USD 492.3 , rounded off to USD 500.Please remember it’s not about amount but about participation in
compassion. We’re not asking for big amounts.
We’re encouraging small financial contribution, so that everyone should
participate in this noble cause. Contributors will not only get satisfaction of
being involved, spreading compassion but also get an opportunity to buy happiness
with money; through social spending.Within a period of one year, our experiment has
shared our gratitude, compassion, joy and love to children suffering from
cancer, beggars, rag-pickers, workers, Police and Army. Indian Army (and a few
others) have appreciated our work this year | www.someonesomewhere.org/#!letters-of-appreciation/ce5q
The Impact

We believe that by inviting people to contribute to
our noble cause, we’re not only creating waves of compassion, but supporting a
big number of disabled communities in India. This step is small but the
repercussions can be big and spread far; like a butterfly effect.We've being doing little experiments with compassion
and have noticed that its impact is exponential. And, we've found that it’s contagious
too. More and more people are joining our experiment in a variety of projects |

In a lot of ways, dentists are very lucky – we work hard to learn a profession people respect, and we love our jobs. But sometimes we can get a little… uninspired. I’m working to change that.</p>
<p>Being a dentist is about more than just drills and floss – we help people. A woman who gets her smile fixed gets a new job. A younger man whose broken teeth are crowned can see his daughter again without shame. A longer, healthier life is sometimes as simple filling a simple cavity.</p>
<p>I’ve seen these things myself from my dental chair, and I’ve dedicated my time and energy to spreading the word – bringing dental services to people who have no access to them, and sharing with my fellow professionals and all of you around the web the difference it makes.</p>
<p><strong>Dental Outreach: Colombia</strong></p>
<p>Since I started dental school, I’ve participated in two outreach trips to the developing world. The first, to Ecuador in 2012, was a great success – inspiring and thrilling and truly helpful. The second, to the Colombian Amazon in June, 2013, is going to be bigger and better.</p>
<p>On my trip, I will be treating locals with little or no access to dental care, because of a lack of money, education or knowledge. I will be visiting remote areas where dentists are too far to provide regular treatment.</p>
<p>I will be performing a variety of important and difficult procedures. This is not a vacation. But while there, I will document the experiences, growth, learning, and value contributed by the trip. I will update an online journal and be taking pictures to share when I get back.</p>
<p><strong>What will you do with the money?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1)     </strong><strong>Transportation</strong> – Your contributions will help me travel to and from the Amazon in Colombia and to get around villages and communities while I am there.</p>
<p><strong>2)     </strong><strong>Dental materials – </strong>Your contributions will also help supply the critical materials I need to treat the patients I will meet along the way.</p>
<p><strong>3)     </strong><strong>Sharing the story – </strong>Your contribution will also help me share the story of my trip in the hope of inspiring a culture of dentists.</p>

Please see my weightloss story below</p><p><br/></p><p>I started my weight loss journey 36 months ago, my weight was spiralling out of control and if I didn't do something about it, it would only make my mobility and my health a lot worse. I started my journey at 28 stone 8 pound and with the help and encouragement from my brother Stephen Hocking I wouldn't be where I am today. My confidence when I was 28 stone 8 pound was really affecting me, I never went anywhere without my coat on and would not go to public place...s or into shops when they were busy. I use to avoid going out with friends it would affect me that much. My brother helped my by paying for a personal trainer to help me with my eating habits and also my exercise programme. Don't get me wrong I've had an amazing amount of support from my friends and family. I started of on a detox programme for 3 weeks to try and stop me craving certain food groups. I then started going to a boxing gym with my personal trainer and walking with my colleague/friends. Little by little I increased my exercise and re introduced food groups. I started with a short jog and slowly built it up, i would never jog or even attempt to run in the day or on main roads so i use to get up at 5 - 5:30 most morning or go to places where no one would be. My weight loss would vary from 1 - 4 pound a week. After all this hard work, I'm now a lot more confident, a lot happier, fitter, I enjoy going to the gym and socialising with friends and now have a new way of thinking about food. I still have the old treat whether this be a bag of sweets or a curry, I'll have 1 cheat day a week and then back on to healthy eating. I exercise 3 - 4 times a week and I have even started swimming. I go to the gym on my wn but when they can i go with my sister Vicky Hocking, my nephew Taylor Lucas and will soon be going with my brother Stephen Hocking. I currently only go swimming with my sister. Now i run 6 - 8 miles a week and it doesn't affect me (confidence wise) to run on the main roads or during peak times.

These supplies are desperately needed to help health workers combat the Ebola outbreak. And they need them NOW.
<p>This shipment is due to leave Los Angeles for Liberia on October 11th. This can only happen with your help. We need to raise $2000.</p>
<p>Gracie Ann Esther Dinkins was born in Oakland, California to parents who were pursuing graduate studies at UC Berkeley, in 1966.

She returned to the U.S. and graduated from Cal State, Dominguez Hills with a Degree in Chemistry and matriculated to UC Irvine for medical school. It was during her surgical clinical rotation at the Long Beach VA Hospital that she realized where she was truly happy – in the operating room. Trauma surgery was a specialty that suited her personality and would never bore her. After 3 years in a King/Drew surgery Residency program, she decided to take a break and enjoy a research fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco, where she rediscovered her love for running became an Olympian for the second time, running the 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics for Liberia and advancing to the quarterfinals. </p>
<p>After that excitement, returning to Los Angeles and completing her surgery residency was a relief. She finished a fellowship in Trauma/Critical Care at King/ Drew Center in 1999.

<p>An annual Day Camp and Youth Festival by Dr. Dinkins was established in 2009.</p>
<p>Dr. Dinkins is also a proud member of the Medical Team, established in 1990 by a former Chief Resident of King Drew.  Drs Peter and Leslie Bostick  continue to lead groups of doctors, lawyers, nurses and other professionals around the world every year, performing surgeries, running clinics, and bringing medical supplies to people in need.  The Bosticks continue to serve as her leadership mentors. </p>

Journey……</b></p>
<p>I’m a forty three year old male, who until this month, was yes, overweight,
but just a “normal” guy going through life just like the rest of us. Well I’ve
just received the wake-up call that has certainly kicked my “Butt” into action.</p>
<p>My Doctor recently told me that I have Diabetes and that my
Cholesterol levels were way to high, this compounded by the realisation that I
was just too fat and unfit.</p>
<p>Not the rosy picture one wants moving into the prime of their life in
their forties.</p>
<p>I NEED HELP – Not a lot, but some guidance and support through these
times in getting my health and life in order. It’s better to attack it now than
when I become a real burden on my family, friends and society with major health
restrictive problems down the track.</p>
<p>Goal</p>
<p>To lose 15 kg in 30 days!<br/>
This will kick start me on my quest to lose a total of 44 kg’s getting me under
100kgs. (I currently weigh 143kg)</p>
<p><b>What we need and what
you get!</b></p>
<p>I am looking for help – I am trying to raise $1,000, of which

Journey……
I’m a forty three year old male, who until this month, was yes, overweight,
but just a “normal” guy going through life just like the rest of us. Well I’ve
just received the wake-up call that has certainly kicked my “Butt” into action.
My Doctor recently told me that I have Diabetes and that my
Cholesterol levels were way to high, this compounded by the realisation that I
was just too fat and unfit.
Not the rosy picture one wants moving into the prime of their life in
their forties.
I NEED HELP – Not a lot, but some guidance and support through these
times in getting my health and life in order. It’s better to attack it now than
when I become a real burden on my family, friends and society with major health
restrictive problems down the track.
Goal
To lose 15 kg in 30 days!
This will kick start me on my quest to lose a total of 44 kg’s getting me under
100kgs. (I currently weigh 143kg)
What we need and what
you get!
I am looking for help – I am trying to raise $1,000, of which
30% will go to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) helping find a
cure for Diabetes.
The balance will help me achieve my goal by paying for a
professional, personal “Health Care Administrator” from My Health Journey and
enrolling me in their online Global Healthcare portal. More specifically they
will help me navigate through the life change that is needed to lose weight and
dealing with being a diabetic.
By sponsoring my health goals you will not only have the
satisfaction of knowing that you are helping me but will also have the
opportunity to receive FREE, the same services that I will be fortunate enough
to have. 
The Impact
The goal that you will be sponsoring me for is to lose
weight (15kg initially, an overall total of about 43kg). But this is really
just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how that will help change my life.

Understanding and getting my diabetes under control is a
life changer for me, the other options are not bright and is not a road I want
to go down. 
I have also applied for a bus driver’s position, but cannot start until I have
lost at least 15kg, so it also means meaningful employment. 
Lastly, I guess that the old saying that you don’t know what you have until you
have lost it, somewhat rings true. This is a wakeup call for me to get my
health in order, your sponsorship will help me achieve this.My promises to you
and myself
1) 
I will give my health goal priority attention,
and will do all within my power to achieve it
2) 
I will regularly give updates on my progress for
all to see and follow. Not just over the first 30 days but ongoing as I get
closer to my long term target of 100 kg.
3) 
I will be contactable and will answer any
questions or queries that people might have.
4) 
I will do a blog of “my health journey” this
will hopefully help others who find themselves in my situation.

me to have.

If things continue the way they are we will more than likely lose our home. My back is against the wall. I have sold what i can of my personal belongings to make ends meet. It is my hope that you can find it in your heart to help out in any way you can. Thank you and please share our story with your friends. my promise is to one day pay it forward and help others in need like us. Thank you.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Justan's Story</h3>
<p><span>Born in New Orleans in November of 1982. Justan Carlson has been drawing since he could pick up a crayon and draw on the walls. He started tattooing in June of 2004, professionally piercing a few months later and doing scarification around the same time. He was the first person to do scarification in the quad cities (iowa)  and chances are if you’ve seen someone with a branding in that area; he did it.</span><br/><br/><span>Justan specializes in zombie/horror art. His passion lies in all horror movies, southern culture and “braaaaaains”. Throughout his life so far; he’s lived everywhere but the east coast, he enjoyed Canada and New Orleans the most. Although he has type 1 diabetes, he doesn’t let that slow him down; much less allow it to be a hinderance in his natural born talents.</span></p>
<p><span>Residing currently in Denver, his diabetes has taken a very painful, and inconvenient turn for the worse. His teeth and gums have been severely attacked by the diabetes, and he needs to undergo a large amount of dental work in the very near future, to avoid any futher complications with his health. 12 extractions, 8 fillings, and partial dentures to be exact. </span></p>
<p>However, this is not a stopping point for Justan, this is merely a bump in the road. Hope is set high, and this will not stop him. </p>

<p>My name is Juliet, or Julz for short. I’m a 38 year old transwoman or male-to-female  transgender individual. As an teen, I wanted so badly to look like women I saw on television and my friends in high school. I hated myself for not having the body that I wanted, for instead having a body that didn’t even feel like mine. As I grew older, I thought I could learn to accept that this was the body I was given and it’s the only one I’m going to get. So no matter what, I’m going to try to make the best of it in any way I can. This didn’t work out as well as I had planned.</p>
<p><strong>My transition</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to look in the mirror and not recognize the body that you see. It’s depressing  and demoralizing. Thankfully we live in modern times and there are options available for girls like me. I started HRT 2 years ago and the changes have been fantastic. Little by little each day, I move closer to my ideal. <strong>I can’t describe how wonderful it is to see myself becoming the woman I have longed to be.</strong> But each day, I see my chest, and although there has been minimal growth, knowing that my body is still wrong in a rush of sadness, alienation, and anxiety. So daily I wear padding to mimic full breast and no low cut shirts. This causes me to suffer the side effects of sweat rashes, heat blisters, and daily irritation.</p>
<p>My family, while in the past being supportive of the choices I made, when I came out to them, they didn’t  really support me at all,since then they have made some progress to accepting me for who I am,but not much more, but time will tell the future . My decision to get surgery or any kind of medical intervention involving my gender, was solely on me, so I am financially on my own. I would not be able to afford the hormone treatments if it wasn’t for the care of the VA directive that was released in 2011 covering the treatment of transgendered veterans. Only then was I able to afford the meds needed.I have also been in therapy for some time and can provide the required letter of recommendation, saying that “<strong>transgender surgery is the next step in the transition process</strong>”, a qualification also provided by the Trans Standards of Care (WPATH).</p>
<p>For me, top surgery represents the biggest joy I can imagine, starting from when I was entering puberty. After years of research, advice, and self-reflection, I’ve made the final decision to pursue top surgery. At the end of the procedure, I will have a well-developed female chest. <strong>But the most valuable part of the surgery is that I will finally feel at home in my own body</strong>. All I want is to be happy and this is the key to it. And I will be the happiest low-cut shirt wearing woman you’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>So I am humbly asking for your help and support to make this possible, to make my dream a reality, and bringing me one step closer to being myself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I need your help!</strong></p>
<p>Top surgery is very expensive, especially for a young woman  that has returned to college attempting to make her way in the world. I’m currently a CNA and have applied for the nursing program, but the pay as a CNA is dismal and most of it goes to pay for rent, bills, food, so that I can survive. In this situation, it’s very difficult to find the money to put away for something that will help me thrive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This seems like an insurmountable cost, but no amount is to small or too great. Every donation is a little piece of joy, a smile just for you, knowing I am one step closer to my dream, my one hope, becoming a reality.</p>
<p>Even if you can’t personally contribute,  please pass the word along. Send this to your friends and neighbors and allies. Because this surgery will literally change my life. For the first time, I will be able to feel my body and not feel dysphoria and pain; there will only be joy, happiness, and possibility. And that truly is the greatest gift of all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Questions?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>I know some of you might have questions for me before you decide to donate. Its not an easy desicion to donate and have some thought in your head you would like to have answered. So, I am going to give you a way to ask me your question before you donate if you want. You can email me at <strong>blazindizzy@juno.com</strong>. I will try to respond to your questions in reasonable time.</p>

</h3>
<p>Many of you know me already, some don't (hopefully), but regardless - it's time for my top surgery. After 6+ years of binding my breasts I'm ready to feel sun and air on my skin again and to leave the chest binding behind. I've patiently tolerated wearing two shirts during hot Arizona summers, having sweat roll down my back, and not being able to wear many shirts I like because they're ""too revealing"".<br/></p>
<p>I scheduled my surgery for late-mid October...yes! As the days count down I'm imagining what it will be like to feel a shirt, and just a shirt, directly on my skin. I'll be having surgery in Florida and it will be performed by Dr. Charles Garramone. He tries to keep the fees reasonable but because insuranace companies see this surgery as cosmetic and not necessary, it must be paid for out of pocket. This includes the surgery fee, surgery center, meds, rental car, hotel, time off from work and food while away so I need  some help paying for all of this. </p>
<p>It's difficult for me to ask others to help but I believe it's necessary and that in the end I'll be happy that I did. Anything that can be contributed helps greatly. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Here's a breakdown of the various expenses:</h3>

<p><br/></p>
<p>**All needed funds will go to expenses and anything additional I'll donate to another person.<br/></p>
<br/>I've donated both time and money to funding others' surgeries and am ready to go myself. I knew I would know when it was time because I wasn't ready in the beginning. It's been important to me to spend some time with my body and not make an irreversible change before I am ready. The time has come. :) <br/>
</div> <div> <p>I know that the reality is that sometimes we can't contribute financially and I completely understand - I've been there. But any and all help is wanted and appreciated.

  I know that the reality is that sometimes we can't contribute financially and I completely understand - I've been there. But any and all help is wanted and appreciated. If you're able to forward this to others that might be interested in donating you'll have my undying love. 
Thank you so much,

Our Story
Mike Ruggles is a well-known Big Island medical cannabis activist and patient. He is known for his charismatic, funny, down-to-earth, kind and generous nature. He’s mentored 100’s of people on  their rights, and how to legally get started, safely cultivate, process, and consume cannabis in its various forms to best suit their needs.
This last January, Mike noticed the definition of “medical use” in Hawaii’s medical marijuana law has been changed to now allow medical cannabis patients to transfer medicine between each other. Combined with State and Federal laws on controlled substances, he saw a legal opportunity to start a collective for patients to help each other. Mike contacted over 20 government agencies from the Attorney General’s Office to various  related offices to inquire this law change. Not one agency denied the legality.
So, he opened the Alternative Pain Management Pu`uhonua LLC Collective and modeled it after legally successful collectives in California. “Pu’uhonua” translates to “place of refuge.” In just 9 months, hundreds of medical marijuana patients joined, with the majority being over 50 years of age, including hospice patients and veterans. Not only was membership free, but patients had  variety of medical resources. The collective was a success.
Despite the fact that the collective (1) legal, (2) paid taxes, and (3) clearly benefited the community, on September 10th the collective was raided by Hawaii police, (who are publicly opposed to the Hawaii's medical cannabis program) and Mike was arrested. Not only were terminally ill patients’ medicine seized, Mike is being wrongly charged with running a “dispensary” and is now facing 77 years in prison- a life sentence. Mike is a father of four and grandfather of five. He needs a good attorney.
It's been 15 years since Hawaii's medical marijuana program started. It's time for law enforcement to support the legal right for patients to acquire the medications recommended by their doctor. Though legal, for 15 years patients have been dangerously forced to purchase their medicine from the black market. It's time for change.

If you agree that: 


It's reasonable that medical marijuana patients be able to acquire medicine through a Collective.

Mike doesn't deserve a life sentence.
Patients shouldn't have to wait so that only 2 dispensaries can monopolize and somehow serve our over 5,000 Big Island medical marijuana patients and charge whatever the want.


Please consider making a donation now. If a thousand people donate $10, that's a critical $10,000 toward the cause.
By donating you aren’t just keeping Mike out of prison, you're helping to set precedence for the collective model statewide.
All funds will go directly to the Save Ruggles legal fund. Unfortunately, good attorney's are expensive and it's going to take one of the best to WIN this.

This year – for the 4th time now – SapfoFest returns on 17- 19th July 2015 @ Žeimiai Manor House (Jonava district, Lithuania) determined to improve and succeed in acting together! SapfoFest is the first totally free and independent community-initiated Festival in the
Baltics, which seeks to connect and empower the queer community, fight
prejudice and discrimination, as well as increase awareness and visibility of
queers in Lithuania and the rest of Eastern Europe. Even without any
major institutional support, for the 4th time this year SapfoFest is
growing and expanding through volunteering, services in-kind, crowd funding and
in-kind donations. A lot of determination by its organizers, volunteers and
increasing number of participants (2012 – 70; 2013 – 100; ir 2014 – 200) have
succeeded in creating a learning, sharing, empowering space for queer and LGBT+
community & allies in Lithuania and the Baltics. Through
powerful tools of education, culture & knowledge
sharing we seek
to mobilize our resources and capacity that are necessary to bring social
change and create the society of the future!







* S A P F O F E S T  * G O A L S * 
The annual free-of-charge Festival seeks to:
• raise awareness of sexual and gender
inequalities both within the queer community itself and beyond in Lithuania and
the rest of Eastern Europe; 
• educate the queer community and its allies
by designing an ambitious educational and cultural program of the Festival;
• empower & connect the queer community
members & their allies by creating a shared space;
• increase social inclusion via joint artistic
and sporting activities;
• provide access to community resources for
the individuals that are in need;
• create a stable platform for the queer
community building, networking and knowledge exchange. 




* S A P F O F E S T  * O U T P U T S : * C O N T E N T S * &  * A C T I V I T I E S*


For
the fourth year in a row the Festival will be strengthening ties among the queer
community members by bringing people together into a shared space and providing
knowledge on queer and LGBT+ issues internationally and in Lithuania. SapfoFest has a broad educational, cultural
as well as arts and sports programme that extends over 3 days from 17th
to 19th July. The programme is divided into six types of activity: 



SapfoEdu  is  the educational segment of the programme which
includes a wide range of lectures and workshops. The purpose of this part of
the programme is to provide a platform supporting the exchange of ideas,
information, activist strategies related to queer and LGBT+ rights, discourse
and problems. Educational activities are crucial for our own development as individuals
and community  and are a prerequisite for
social change.




SapfoArt is the cultural part of
the programme that consists of music, photography and mixed media events,
painting exhibitions, creative writing workshops and poetry readings. The aim of this programme is to provide
a platform supporting arts and culture as a method for working with queer and LGBT+
rightsand issues. The programme aims at creating the exchange of new ideas,
activist and cultural strategies that are at the core of social change. Famous
queer artists and well known activists will join SapfoArt.


SapfoFilm features film screenings
and related discussions of interest. This programme will provide a platform for
exploring, celebrating and advancing queer and LGBT+ communities through the
expression of cinema, and it will tackle a wide range of social, political and economic
issues. 



SapfoSport  consists of a variety of sporting activities. SapfoSport
will unite, strengthen and connect the queer and LGBT+ community members
through increasing participation in sports and mutual respect for one another,
and will aim to tackle social and economical exclusion.

SapfoDisco is all about nightlife and
having fun together. Live music, karaoke and the dance floor
will provide a Festive ambience to meet and connect the queer community members
and their allies.  

SapfoSpecials. From sex workshops to
dating platforms. This part of the programme changes annually in order to develop new ways we
can enrich and make our sexual lives safer as well as more satisfying. In the
Lithuanian context taboo breaking is critical. 






* I M P A C T * O F * S A P F O F E S T  * 

The diverse Festival programme and shared
community space will lead to:

· 
increased
awareness & knowledge within the target audience (the queer and LGBT+
community & allies, especially among the new members) and their resulting
familiarity with relevant LGBT+ issues, queer movement, rights and the
legal  context at the national, regional
and international level;


· 
social
inclusion & cohesion. The target audience will have a better access to the
queer and LGBT+ community support & shared resources, such as legal advice
or support in case of verbal or physical abuse);

· building a
strong community and opening-up opportunities for future collaborations;

· 
increased
visibility and representation of the queer and LGBT+ communities and queer
women in particular, beyond the community itself: via mass-media on political
and public level, necessary for a social change.


We invite You to support the SapfoFest 2015 and make these goals a reality!




* W H A T * Y O U R * S U P P O R T * W I L L * B E * U S E D* F O R*?   



All events at the Festival are free - we believe that non-discriminatory behaviour should also be free of economic exclusion.  Those willing to contribute may do so; and those who cannot should not be precluded from participating. Your contributions will help to cover the costs of organizing the SapfoFest 2015 programme, and will contribute to the direct costs such as transportation, stage construction and venue costs, including electricity and utilities, as well as some financial support for Zeimiai Manor House  and programme participants. The funds raised from this crowdfunding campaign will allow us to increase the quality of the Festival outputs, and to provide for financial contributions for:



1.  *S Y N A E S T H E S I S* - contemporary music ensemble - agreed to perform
at the SapfoFest 2015, and we would like to support the work and potential of
these young brave and ambitious
musicians!

* S Y N A E S T H E S I S* is an organism, and experiment, that differentiates itself from the pure practice of music. The
name * S Y N A E S T H E S I S* refers to the poorly
understood phenomenon of synesthetics – an uncontrollable mix of emotions with
the world of feelings: sound, colour and odour. * S Y N A E S T H
E S I S* can turn music into a blue-ish dot, pain into a
ringing in your head, perfume to melody. While searching for the most
interesting approaches to this, the musicians in * S Y N A E S T H
E S I S* try to find new ways to turn contemporary experimental
music not only in to something more meaningful, but also into a tradition that
takes its roots in Lithuania. 


This team of young, brave and ambitious musicians
has taken up the mission of introducing experimental Lithuanian and foreign
composer works to big concert halls. The cast of the ensemble, which can sound
as frightening and grand as a rock band or a small chamber orchestra, creates a
widely and creatively exploited sound field, which reveals a kind of collective
universality that can be equated to the origins of music itself.

2. 
* P L A N N I N G T O R O C K *
In cooperation with Goethe Institut Vilnius, we are thrilled to have these amazing artists with us! While Goethe Institut will partially cover their fees (Goethe provides 1500 EUR), we still need to cover the rest to make it happen: (the total fee is 3000 EUR) plus flights, costs of  technical equipment, stage, lighting, local transport and accommodation, as well as local hospitality:) 





3. * C L A S S I C A L * M U S I C * T R I O * T H I R T Y * F I N G E R S * -   will create an opportunity to enjoy some classical music. 
Members of * T H I R T Y * F I N G E R S * - Marta Finkelštein (piano), Lora Kmieliauskaitė (violin) ir Arnas Kmieliauskas (cello) - are accomplished students of Academy of Music, they are laureates of International competitions and participants of various festivals. Recently they won a prize for ,,Creative outburst"" in Chamber Music Competition in Vilnius. This summer * T H I R T Y * F I N G E R S*  will represent Lithuania in prestigious Isa Chamber Music Masterclasses in Austria. We are very grateful for  * T H I R T Y * F I N G E R S * T R I O* for agreeing to play at SapfoFest 2015, and would like to support their work - we believe it is a future of the worldwide classical music scene! 




4. *Š O K I A I* S U* S I M A* I R* S A L N E* - a Lithuanian DJ duo, whom we are so proud to have at the SapfoFest 2015! Sima and Šalnė accepted to play and make crowds dance at the SapfoFest 2015, and we would like to support their work! Every contribution makes a difference! 









In order to support these amazing artists, we need Your help! If You have means, please contribute and help to make it happen! 

* O T H E R * W A Y S * Y O U * C A N * H E L P*  S A P F O F E S T  *  Some people just can't contribute with donations and its ok, but that doesn't mean You can't help SapfoFest:  Get the word out and make some noise about SapfoFest campaign!  Share our Indiegogo platform with Your friends, colleagues, families, friends and strangers!   * U S E F U L * L I N K S* Visit SapfoFest website: http://www.sapfofest.org/Like SapfoFest on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/sapfofest

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Innovation: Africa's mission is simple: we bring solar and agricultural technologies from Israel to Africa. Since 2008, we've completed 63 solar projects alone. These are solar powered schools for students and adults to study in the evening; medical clinics for emergency nighttime care and refrigeration of lifesaving vaccines; and water pumps for providing clean water to communities in need. </p>
<p>Innovation: Africa used to be known as Jewish Heart for Africa. Why the change? Learn more <a href=""http://www.innoafrica.org/jha-ia.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We've Done So Far</h3>
<p>So far, our projects serve 454,422 people, but there are so many more who need us.</p>
<p>Last Hanukkah, in just 8 days, we raised $8,498 to bring light to Sapiri Medical Center in Uganda. We gave them electricity in their inpatient ward to treat patients at night. They no longer use dangerous kerosene lamps for night time procedures, and they have a refrigerator in which to store lifesaving medicines and vaccines. For the first time, the 7,890 residents of Sapiri Village have access to the medical care they deserve.</p>
<p>Click <a href=""http://jhanews.org/2012/04/05/let-there-be-light-update/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> to learn more about the impact of last year's campaign.  </p>
<p>One year later, the number of patients visiting Sapiri each night has doubled and the number of women coming in to give birth has tripled. They are running out of space.</p>
<p>They also have a primary school nearby. It serves 1,400 children -- 636 boys and 764 girls. Nearly 300 are orphans, mostly due to AIDS. These 1,400 children have no place to study after the sun sets. Most cannot even afford candles or kerosene lamps in their homes. And for those who can, they risk fire, eye strain and lung disease, all just to study after the sun goes down. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>With $10,000, we will go back to Sapiri Village to do two things:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">1. We will extend the solar energy we installed last year at Sapiri Medical Center's inpatient ward to a second building nearby, the outpatient wing. With light in a second building, there will be plenty of space for all the new patients coming in at night since the installation of solar energy. We will also give them power for a laboratory with a microscope that will allow the doctors to diagnose diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. Diagnosing and treating these diseases earlier means that patients will receive the care they need sooner, and will increase their chances for a full recovery. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">2. We will power Sapiri Primary School, providing students with a place to study and learn at night. The teachers have already offered to stay late and teach evening classes. The 1,400 students will have a safe place to study without risking their eyesight and lungs, and will have the opportunity to work towards the brighter future they want for themselves. </p>
<p>We don't have much time. Hanukkah is only 8 days long. But with your help, we can use this week long holiday to bring light to those who live without it. And for the people of Sapiri Village, every day will be a Festival of Lights. </p>

<p>Welcome to the campaign for my brother Curt Griffin, he is a strong person with so much passion for life.  I should mention that Curt is my brother-in-law, but he is family not an in-law.  My name is Patricia Griffin, I joined the family some 18 years ago and I immediately gained a second family.  Curt has been like a real brother to me, helping me and my family in every way possible.  I have never been able to repay his generosity and now I find myself having to sit back and watch as he struggles to make ends meet.  I couldn’t do it……I have to do something, so here I am begging and pleading for your HELP!</p>
<p>Curt has just finished an 8 week round of chemo and radiation treatment, it hit him hard this time.  He is only just now able to keep solid food down and is still fighting serious fatigue and a coughing fit every time he talks.  This is his second fight with cancer, the first just two years ago.  This time it is lung cancer, a mass on a bronchial tube.  It could not be removed surgically, so once again he had to do chemo and radiation.  His lung has begun to re-inflate on its own and things seem to be feel nicely.  However my biggest fear is that the stress of all the medical bills and of being so deep in debt will have him relapsing.  He is a very strong, but very stubborn person.  It is absolutely killing his pride to have to ask for help, but I am glad he is finally letting me do something.  Sitting back and having to watch and hear the crap he is going through and not being able to do a thing about it almost made me crazy.</p>
<p>For me as much as I want to help this is the hardest part, with the economy as it is I don’t want to take something that another is in need of.  Like asking a local small business for a donation, I feel horrible that is something they can sell for profit to pay bills and put food on their tables.  However I have to ask for your HELP I need to show my brother, that random acts of kindness still exist in this world.  Show him that there are people out there willing to help out another in a desperate situation.  I need support for him and his family in every way; I need to know that I somehow made a difference.</p>
<p>I set a goal of $2,500; any help at this point will be truly a gift from above.  I need to see him smile; I need him to know that things will get better.  So please any help you can provide would be amazing.</p>
<p>I have also set up a benefit to be held on March 10<sup>th</sup> from 11 to 6 @ 126 Gnau Ave SW Unit A in Massillon Ohio 44646, if you cannot make a monetary contribution, please do whatever you can to pass along this information and spread the word.</p>
<p>*ALL FUNDS will go to Curt and his family.</p>
<p>Please think your hearts and make this a special event for family friend who would do it for you. Time is never on anyone's side so really this is now or never people.</p>

<p><strong>Can a High School Foreign Exchange Student Help Change the World?</strong></p>
<p>We believe the answer is yes.  Shortly after he arrived in Davenport, Iowa as a scholarship recipient, 17 year old Mwalimu began to dream about raising money to give his village a water well. The culture shock of coming from Kenya to the USA was great for this young man from humble origin. As he enjoyed all the wonderful things his American host family had to offer, Mwalimu couldn't stop thinking about the women in his village (including his own mother) who walked two miles each way to get water from a dirty, stagnant pond.</p>
<p><em>""One thing I notice is that Americans have an abundance of clean drinking water.  The same is not true in my country.  We don't have clean water in my own village."" </em><strong>Mwalimu in December of 2011</strong></p>
<p>He shared this vision with his host family, his local exchange program coordinator and a pastor originally from Kenya.  This core team, along with students at Davenport West High School and exchange students from all over the world, committed to making Mwalimu's Dream come true. Speaking engagements and media events were arranged for him. Mwalimu even wrote a children's book entitled <strong><em>Mwalimu's Dream</em></strong> which was illustrated by another exchange student, Arina Russkikh from Russia. The book was published and proceeds were used to make this dream of a water well come true.</p>
<p>By the time he went home the money was raised to dig the well. He left America in mid-June and by the end of June the well was dug. The water was deep and they dug for days hitting water on Mwalimu's birthday. In the next few weeks the last of the money was raised back in the Quad Cities to buy solar panels, a pump, water tank and platform. Today the project is complete and Mwalimu's mother, and the other women in the village, no longer have to walk for water.  Already Mwalimu's dream is saving lives!</p>

<p>Most people would be this happy if they struck gold; but millions on this planet are filled with joy to have clean, safe drinking water. Thank you Mwalimu for giving us the gift of helping your people!</p>

<h3>How did Mwalimu end up in Iowa?</h3>
<p>Because of his academic success, interview skills and English speaking ability, young Mwalimu William Karisa earned a scholarship through the Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange &amp; Study (YES) program. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.yesprograms.org/yesabroad"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kennedy-Lugar YES Abroad Program </a></p>
<p>So this is how Mwalimu happened to become an exchange student at Davenport West High School during the school year 2011-12.  He enjoyed school and his extra-curricular activities were cross country track and youth group.  No doubt his greatest accomplishment was raising the money for the water well for his village. As he got on the airplane to go home to Africa, Mwalimu left knowing dreams really do come true! </p>
<h3><strong>Today Mwalimu's Dream (Phase II) continues in an effort to raise money for wells in Niger ...</strong></h3>
<p>Mwalimu's Dream is partnering with Wells4Wellness of Moline, Illinois and Relief Network Ministries, Inc. of League City, Texas.</p>

<p>This is a humanitarian work that knows the importance of safe, clean drinking water. Wells4Wellness has worked successfully with Operation Blessing in both Cambodia and in Africa.</p>
<p>Currently <strong>Wells4Wellness</strong> is working with Relief Network Ministries in Texas targeting the country of Niger. The horrifying statistics in that country are:</p>
<ul>
<li>16,500,000 people in Niger</li>
<li>Average life expectancy is 53 years</li>
<li>Average income per year is $700.00</li>
<li>6% of the population has electricity</li>
<li>1 in 3 children go to school</li>
<li>Every 20 seconds a child dies from unclean water.   </li>
</ul><h3>Meet Pat Herath ... </h3>
<p><strong>Pat Herath is the Director of Wells4Wellness</strong>. She is excited every time the funds are raised to dig a well (average cost in Niger is $2,500). However, she has been saddened that the big rigs working to dig wells cannot go to the remote areas of Niger. So this is what this fundraiser is all about! </p>
<p>We are raising the money needed to buy a small rig that can be taken to these areas where children are dying every day. There are no roads going into many of these places.</p>
<p>For this reason Pat knows she must partner with someone who was raised in the area and can work with locals to make this dream come true. She has found that partner in Relief Network Ministries, Inc.</p>

<p><strong>    Our Story   </strong>                                                                                 </p>
<p>             Where do I start? I’m sure you have heard it all and seen it all- people writing letters and taking videos about what is happening with their lives; their pains and sorrows, heartaches and problems that have halted their lives.   Out of desperation and not knowing where to turn, we decided to start a fund raising in order to bring hope and light again in our lives, and maybe , just maybe, a smile that willdominate into a lifetime of hope.  I am one of those people who is looking for that smile for my sister.  She was diagnosed with Lyme disease 6 years ago and not knowing she has had it, has made our lives for the past 3 years the hardest imaginable.  Along with the Lyme disease, she has environmental illness which has turned our lives upside down. Environmental illness is difficult to live with.  Individuals who have this are hypersensitive and some like my sister are affected by electricity, magnetic fields, low and high frequencies. This means she can’t be around any chemical smells (perfume, soaps, etc...), anything that works on electricity, electrical wires, transformers, cell phones, computers, motors of any kind and so on. You can imagine how difficult it has been for us.  Apart from that, she is also light sensitive and has been living in the dark for the past 2 ½ years</p>
<p>            We live in the Laurentians, north of Montreal, Canada.  In 2009, from the month of August up until November, we lived in the dark with no electricity to accommodate my sister’s needs.  The doctors said she needed to be away from the elements that make her ill.  That is why we took her in, my husband and I and our two young children of 8 and 4 and a half years of age.  It was very difficult; our children sacrificed so much for their aunt.  We used hot bottles to warm up when autumn came along. Using heaters was out of the question in order to help my sister.  Winter was soon on its way and out of desperation, I contacted her doctor and she said that some people isolated themselves to keep away from the elements that are keeping them sick.</p>
<p>            We then built an 8x12 trailer in the hopes that it could be used to transport her to where she could be safe and bring her to her doctor.  Unfortunately, because we needed to build it a specific way using inert materials that her sensitivities could handle, the trailer ended up weighing too much and wasn’t safe to move.  She lived in the trailer for about 2 years, electricity free, with no bathroom.  She did her waste in glass jars that we emptied daily.  She is connected to our home to heat her trailer through a water heating system.</p>
<p>            Her needs are getting too much for me and my family to handle.  We needed help to build her a safe home but no one had the heart to support us.  My parents took a 125 000.00 mortgage to help her and we are now 50 000.00 in debt because of the special materials that were needed; we went way over budget.  We don’t have the money to pay it and the interest keeps increasing. She lived in her atelier (workshop) next to her house for about 8 months.  She was hospitalized at Notre Dame Hospital in late October 2012, but the doctors didn’t know how to help her.  They have been tossing her from hospital to hospital - three hospitals in four months; as one doctor put it, she is the patient no doctor wants.  We would want to take her to the Environmental Health Centre in Dallas run by Doctor William Rhea who can help her.  However, it is in the US and the province where we live does not recognize my sister’s illness and will not pay for treatments.  Her doctor told us that it can costs up to 10 thousand a week to treat her.  That’s money we don’t have.  Our parents just took out a mortgage to help build her home (which is too new for her to live in), but the off gassing of the materials used are affecting her sensitivities so she cannot live there for much longer. We have run out of time and money to help her.  Her treatments are costly and the government won’t help people in her situation.  I’ve been using my children’s monthly support allowance and I’ve used up all my savings.  We are literally at the end of our rope and holding on but the pressure is getting to me and I’m being torn between my children, husband and sister.  I am only one person and I can only do so much. We are trying to change Quebec’s view on this illness.  I hope you can find it in your heart to help in any way possible so we can help my sister today and others in the future.</p>

<p>The Guagliardo and Vaccarella Families</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $130,000. Before Giovanna can go to Texas, she needs to go to another specialized Doctor for strengthening treatments. This can last anywhere from 1 to 2 months. These treatments cost at least $10,000. Giovanna needs a caretaker as well and a place to stay, food, and personal hygiene products. These funds would keep her there for at least 4 months, where she can hopefully overcome her illness. Any contribution would be greatly appreciated! If we do exceed our goal, the rest of the money will be put into a Lyme Disease Foundation for other people going through the same thing as my aunt, and will also be put towards a website for spreading the knowledge and people’s stories on Lyme disease. Her birthday is March 15<sup>th</sup>. Let’s make this a memorable birthday for her by raising enough money to help!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Lyme disease is a relatively new diagnosis in the medical field, even though it has been around for quite some time. Many people are being misdiagnosed, like my aunt, and when they are correctly diagnosed, it is sometimes too late. I don’t want my aunt to be one of those people. I want to raise awareness for Lyme disease, and let people know that it truly does exist, and it does ruin a person’s life. Not only will this help my aunt in overcoming this illness, it will also help raise awareness of this horrible disease and hopefully help others in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Any contribution can help! A dollar per person can make a huge difference! Any amount is welcome and  please share this link with your friends, be it by e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, etc.</p>

Using heaters was out of the question in order to help my sister.  Winter was soon on its way and out of desperation, I contacted her doctor and she said that some people isolated themselves to keep away from the elements that are keeping them sick.
            We then built an 8x12 trailer in the hopes that it could be used to transport her to where she could be safe and bring her to her doctor.  Unfortunately, because we needed to build it a specific way using inert materials that her sensitivities could handle, the trailer ended up weighing too much and wasn’t safe to move.  She lived in the trailer for about 2 years, electricity free, with no bathroom.  She did her waste in glass jars that we emptied daily.  She is connected to our home to heat her trailer through a water heating system.
            Her needs are getting too much for me and my family to handle.  We needed help to build her a safe home but no one had the heart to support us.  My parents took a 125 000.00 mortgage to help her and we are now 50 000.00 in debt because of the special materials that were needed; we went way over budget.  We don’t have the money to pay it and the interest keeps increasing. She lived in her atelier (workshop) next to her house for about 8 months.  She was hospitalized at Notre Dame Hospital in late October 2012, but the doctors didn’t know how to help her.  They have been tossing her from hospital to hospital - three hospitals in four months; as one doctor put it, she is the patient no doctor wants.  We would want to take her to the Environmental Health Centre in Dallas run by Doctor William Rhea who can help her.  However, it is in the US and the province where we live does not recognize my sister’s illness and will not pay for treatments.  Her doctor told us that it can costs up to 10 thousand a week to treat her.  That’s money we don’t have.  Our parents just took out a mortgage to help build her home (which is too new for her to live in), but the off gassing of the materials used are affecting her sensitivities so she cannot live there for much longer. We have run out of time and money to help her.  Her treatments are costly and the government won’t help people in her situation.  I’ve been using my children’s monthly support allowance and I’ve used up all my savings.  We are literally at the end of our rope and holding on but the pressure is getting to me and I’m being torn between my children, husband and sister.  I am only one person and I can only do so much. We are trying to change Quebec’s view on this illness.  I hope you can find it in your heart to help in any way possible so we can help my sister today and others in the future.

What We Need 
Our goal is to raise $130,000. Before Giovanna can go to Texas, she needs to go to another specialized Doctor for strengthening treatments. This can last anywhere from 1 to 2 months. These treatments cost at least $10,000. Giovanna needs a caretaker as well and a place to stay, food, and personal hygiene products. These funds would keep her there for at least 4 months, where she can hopefully overcome her illness. Any contribution would be greatly appreciated! If we do exceed our goal, the rest of the money will be put into a Lyme Disease Foundation for other people going through the same thing as my aunt, and will also be put towards a website for spreading the knowledge and people’s stories on Lyme disease. Her birthday is March 15th. Let’s make this a memorable birthday for her by raising enough money to help!

The Impact
Lyme disease is a relatively new diagnosis in the medical field, even though it has been around for quite some time. Many people are being misdiagnosed, like my aunt, and when they are correctly diagnosed, it is sometimes too late. I don’t want my aunt to be one of those people. I want to raise awareness for Lyme disease, and let people know that it truly does exist, and it does ruin a person’s life. Not only will this help my aunt in overcoming this illness, it will also help raise awareness of this horrible disease and hopefully help others in the process.

Dreamlight’s top priority is helping you get better sleep, and making the Dreamlight as comfortable as possible is the core of this – that’s why it looks different from other sleep masks. Most masks place pressure on the sensitive eyes and cheeks. Instead, Dreamlight's design moves the pressure away from sensitive facial areas. The Dreamlight’s unique wraparound design minimizes pressure on sleep-affecting areas of the face, while remaining in place. By distributing pressure around the back of the head and padding the nose area, Dreamlight sits comfortably on users.Light-led BreathingStudies show that deep breathing elicits a feeling of relaxation, according to an article carried by Harvard Medical School. Dreamlight uses this to ease you into sleep. By breathing along with the soothing glow of Dreamlight's internal orange light, you'll enter sleep quickly and rest better.Try one of Dreamlight's breathing programs below.Sleep MonitoringDreamlight’s heart-rate monitor and gyroscope are used to create a uniquely robust sleep profile, which is displayed in Dreamlight’s cross-platform app. By looking at your vital signs combined with levels of movement, Dreamlight provides personal insight to help you get the best rest possible.The Dreamlight AppSounds of NatureSound and sleep seem like odd bedfellows – but finding the right noises for when your sleeping can help you rest better than ever before. That’s where Dreamlight’s four internal headphones come in. Via Dreamlight’s app, you can create custom soundscapes.

Nature sounds (the sound of rain, for example) were shown to reduce stress and lower heart rates in a 2017 article published by Scientific Reports.

White noise contains a wide frequency of sounds, helping mask environmental noise like loud neighbors or traffic. 

Light music has been scientifically shown to ready the body for sleep and improve quality of sleep.

Binaural beats, or brainwave entertainment, are steady beats played at specific frequencies. Some report entering a peaceful state when listening to binaural beats. 

ASMR, or autonomous sensory meridian response, is a sound-induced tingling feeling that many find relaxing. The Dreamlight app contains dozens of ASMR stimulating options.
We understand everyone is different. By using the sliders inside of our app, you can create a combination of sounds that specifically work for you.After rigorous testing, we have inserted four premium sounding speakers,  invisibly embedded inside the Dreamlight mask. This decision was made so that the speakers can be used at full quality, regardless of head size or ear positioning. Binaural audio gives the surround-sound effect of being present in a relaxing and natural environment, rhythmically drifting to sleep to the patter of light rainfall, laying in the quiet echo of a forest, or resting by a summer brook.Waking UpMillions of people start their day to the scream of an alarm clock: an unpleasant experience that studies suggest may be linked with weight-gain and even heart problems.Dreamlight avoids audio alarms by using internal lights to slowly wake you. The lights within the mask slowly begin to brighten near a set wake time,  so users wake slowly and begin the day relaxed.Infrared Beauty TreatmentDreamlight’s infrared light treatment boosts blood circulation around the eyes while you sleep, improving the skin’s appearance and health.Infrared light is already a widely-used beauty treatment, which may also heal skin damage, according to a 2014 study carried by the US National Library of Medicine.Getting Ahead of Jet LagThere’s no easy way around jet lag. But Dreamlight can help.By entering the date and time of your next flight, Dreamlight’s cross-platform app creates a personalized sleep schedule that slowly adjusts you to your future time zone.Paired with Dreamlight’s circadian rhythm regulating green lights, the Dreamlight mask will minimize jet lag by getting you on the right schedule ahead of time.DNA-based AdviceSleep and genetics are closely linked, with a 2011 Stanford University study finding “It is now clear that sleep is genetically controlled.”By looking at your DNA we can recommend the best sleep schedule for you through the Dreamlight app, and transfer that sleep schedule into the mask.The Dreamlight DNA perk will see your DNA tested so we can provide you with custom advice to help develop your best sleep schedule. It’s as easy as sending a swab to trusted genetic companies like 23andMe, which has mapped the genetics of more than two million people from saliva samples sent through the mail. CleanableThe back panel of the Dreamlight mask is detachable, allowing for easy cleaning.Timeline
Spread the WordFrequently Asked Questions:Q: Will the orange light be on through the whole night?A: No, users choose the light therapy duration via Dreamlight's front controls or inside the Dreamlight app. Q: Will the infrared light be on through the night?A: No, users can set up the infrared facial treatment via Dreamlight's front panel, or inside the Dreamlight app. The infrared facial duration and intensity can be adjusted according to personal preference.Q: Will the music be on through the night?A:  It depends on the users’ preferences. The Dreamlight app has a sleep timer or can be set to replay music. Q: Is it travel-friendly?A: Yes, the Dreamlight will include a travel pouch. Dreamlight is also made of flexible material, which can fold up while traveling. Q: How long does the battery last?A: About 14 days when used for light therapy. About seven days, when used to play audio for 30 minutes daily. For one year on standby.  Q: Will Dreamlight support future upgrades?A: Yes, the Dreamlight can be upgraded with the Dreamlight app. Q: Should I open my eyes or close my eyes during light therapy?A: Both are fine and it depends on the user’s preference. Q: What if the lighting is too strong/weak for me? Can I adjust it?A: Yes, users can adjust the intensity of lighting in the Dreamlight app.For any other questions, please email us at Will@Dreamlight.tech.We're Ready for Mass ProductionWorking from our fabrication lab allowed us to implement rapid, incremental prototyping — testing functionality and performance at every step. This included button-life testing, ensuring the front panel is long lasting. We also tested the product in temperature-humidity containers and thermal shock chambers, ensuring that the Dreamlight mask is being built to the highest quality.Dreamlight received an incredible reception at CES by the president and CEO of CES, Gary Shapiro (pictured).Risks & ChallengesAn experienced team developed Dreamlight, and will continue working on the project. We’re no strangers to manufacturing in China and the challenges involved. While we recognize unforeseen events may pose a challenge, we have a proven record of creating products from design to sale. We have multiple working models and received a favorable review from The Verge, but we need more time and funding to produce Dreamlight at scale. Once we hit our goal, manufacturing and delivery should face minimum challenges.Shipment can at times be tricky: issues can arise with too much demand, delaying delivery. Border customs can also cause issues, possibly resulting in a few days delay. We will be transparent and provide updates if such issues arise.",30.0,1,"1 Campaign

There is no limit to the amount of information available offering different fitness and exercise plans and techniques – but how do you know which is right for you?  To answer this, first you must know your personal strengths and weaknesses, and how these are affecting your performance in either a positive or negative way.
We’re all individuals – so need an exercise plan relevant to our own problems areas and goals.  The Raw Potential mobile app allows you to identify and understand errors in your technique; enabling you to then use the app to design a program of specific exercises to overcome any weaknesses, and to push yourself further on your strengths.

Meteorologists say it was one of the hottest summers in years (but they always say that). Kiril was out on the streets, working relentlessly, trying to make a top sale of his new products. The approach undertaken was direct sales. That involved him being at a hundred different locations each day, sweating in a suit. Ideally, if it was up to him, he would wear short pants and a t-shirt but his mission wouldn’t allow him. He was riding in his old panel van from 1999, where high-end innovations, such as air conditioning didn’t exist. He traveled in something like a mobile sauna. There were numerous occasions where he wouldn’t attend a meeting as he would be completely messy, stinky and smelly, which made him look unprofessional, and frankly, like a foul creature from the Great Below.</p><p> Kiril had a problem. A problem experienced by millions of people around the globe. Nobody was doing anything about.</p><p>Then it him. What if he reverse engineered the process of taking a shower? People would finally be able to shower on the GO and will no longer have to last another second of being sweaty and stinky.</p><p>He had a meeting with his parents who have been running a successful cosmetic company for the last 20 years. For days, they were trying to come up with the best possible solution. After months and countless experiments with different formulas, they finally got the desired results. A MASSIVE 30x80cm NON-WOVEN TOWEL impregnated with uniquely selected showering ingredients. ShowerGO was born.</p><p>Today, Kiril is like ""No Sweat"" Steve - no matter the situation, he just DOESN'T SWEAT IT.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">THE TEAM</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470042845/sjm4hviae4jegzlwmtdd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>FREE WORLDWIDE SHIPPING</strong></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470042982/zzkzz48cikxfzfi5hwyv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WE DELIVER AT YOUR FEET</strong></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>F.A.Q</strong></h3><p><strong>Are there any products like this available?</strong></p><p>Currently, we are the only company that offers a resalable package of 3 Massive Body cleaning wipes.

Ever got your deodorant confiscated at the Airport's metal detection security area? Decompressed air cans/aerosols are prohibited on hand luggage. With SweatGO, you can forget that concern. YOU can now bring along your Portable deodorant in the form of wipe anytime and anywhere you travel.A Message from the Founders of ShowerGO  CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT & SOCIETYExisting research shows that a person on average uses nearly 65,1 liters of water per shower taken. At ShowerGo, we are concerned for the reckless amount of water usage, but also take into consideration the unhealthy and dangerous chemicals that go down the sewerage. We encourage people to use our wipes even when they are at home as 1 ShowerGO package of wipes consists of only 120 ml of liquid, which is roughly 0,03 % of the amount of water that a person uses on average to take a shower. It’s simple mathematics! THE PERKSSPECIAL PERKTHE ENTREPRENEUR

Meteorologists say it was one of the hottest summers in years (but they always say that). Kiril was out on the streets, working relentlessly, trying to make a top sale of his new products. The approach undertaken was direct sales. That involved him being at a hundred different locations each day, sweating in a suit. Ideally, if it was up to him, he would wear short pants and a t-shirt but his mission wouldn’t allow him. He was riding in his old panel van from 1999, where high-end innovations, such as air conditioning didn’t exist. He traveled in something like a mobile sauna. There were numerous occasions where he wouldn’t attend a meeting as he would be completely messy, stinky and smelly, which made him look unprofessional, and frankly, like a foul creature from the Great Below. Kiril had a problem. A problem experienced by millions of people around the globe. Nobody was doing anything about.Then it him. What if he reverse engineered the process of taking a shower? People would finally be able to shower on the GO and will no longer have to last another second of being sweaty and stinky.He had a meeting with his parents who have been running a successful cosmetic company for the last 20 years. For days, they were trying to come up with the best possible solution. After months and countless experiments with different formulas, they finally got the desired results. A MASSIVE 30x80cm NON-WOVEN TOWEL impregnated with uniquely selected showering ingredients. ShowerGO was born.Today, Kiril is like ""No Sweat"" Steve - no matter the situation, he just DOESN'T SWEAT IT. THE TEAMFREE WORLDWIDE SHIPPINGWE DELIVER AT YOUR FEETF.A.QAre there any products like this available?Currently, we are the only company that offers a resalable package of 3 Massive Body cleaning wipes.

<p>When The Nooky Box had its concept launch in 2015, we introduced our original subscription service with our first crowdfunding campaign that raised over $10,000. We had a vision of curating sexual experiences for every <i>body</i> - and it’s still our mission’s core today.</p>
<p>We believe in making pleasure accessible and fun for all genders, sexual orientations and relationship structures. Sex toys are fun and healthy, and we think that’s what sex should be too.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498601664/daiwkqxgwgxzkmej6ph0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our backers agreed then, and we think you still do now!</p>
</div><div>
<p>Sifting through the endless options of available toys can be time-consuming, expensive and oftentimes leads to disappointment and frustration. The sex toy market is saturated with inferior products and suppliers who prioritize their profits over your body’s health and safety. The prospect of navigating this online maze can be daunting.</p>
<h2>Boxes That Come Again &amp; Again...</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498584679/luc1rjzrgi9vv9yk6lxm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Don't worry, we got you!</p>
<p>For The Nooky Box team of professional pleasure-hunters, sourcing the best products is our full-time occupation - and we <i>love</i> our jobs. Our sexual health experts and guest curators consistently find the most unique, well-designed toys and reliable products available. Then we bring them to you in one discreetly delivered package every three months!</p>
<p>Our quarterly boxes give you enough time to experiment with each collection before the next one arrives, but that doesn’t mean you won’t be counting the days till you see your next package in the post.</p>

<h2>Signature Series: Coming Evolution</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498584679/luc1rjzrgi9vv9yk6lxm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It’s been almost two years since our first crowdfunding campaign, where our community of backers helped launch The Nooky Box with 71% of our overall funding goal. Many of our original backers are now satisfied customers. Their feedback and overwhelming support has been critical to the foundation and growth of our company.</p>
<p><strong>""Well, it’s safe to say I have a new favorite Adult Subscription Box. I certainly wasn’t expecting to love this box as much as I do. My very first The Nooky Box was a total success.""</strong><br/>-<i>Sarah Zimmerman | A Year Of Box</i></p>
<p>Thank you. Seriously, you’re the reason we’re here.</p>
<p>Since then, we’ve evolved our vision of what The Nooky Box can provide and how we can better participate in the cultural conversations around sexual health and pleasure. We’re expanding to include a one-stop online marketplace for reliably amazing adult toys from Nooky-approved manufacturers.</p>
<p>The Nooky Subscription Box isn’t going anywhere; we’re passionate about continually introducing our customers to new toys and products that expand their sexual palette and experiences. That being said, there’s nothing wrong with knowing exactly what you want!</p>
<p>If you’ve got a particular itch you’re dying to scratch, the Signature Box lineup is here to serve those desires directly.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498589665/f4k3vlpk01aiujyrtuf1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>You spoke. We listened.</h3>
<p>The Nooky Signature Boxes are here to fill the gap between your fantasies and the bedroom. While our customers love the subscription box, we realize that it’s not the perfect solution for everyone’s sex life; so we developed a line of stand-alone boxes, each curated with a unique spectrum of experiences in mind.</p>
<p>Our Signature line will be consistently available in our online store, so that our customers can choose to purchase one (or more) at a time. Each focuses on a different theme worthy of your attention and exploration; and can be selected based on your particular interests and intentions. We’re launching with 8 boxes but have even more in mind!</p>

<p><strong>How are the Nooky Signature Boxes different from the Nooky Subscription Boxes?</strong></p>
<p>We’re launching our Signature line with this campaign, which includes eight curated collections (with more added as stretch goals!) that’ll be consistently available for purchase via our website. In contrast, subscriptions ship every three months and the contents are a surprise each quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Will I still receive my perk Signature Box if you don't meet your funding goal?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! We are committed to keeping our promises to our backers. We chose a flexible funding goal, and are confident in our capacity to fulfill all rewards even if the unthinkable happens, and we don't quite meet our goal.</p>
<p><strong>Will my Nooky Box be shipped discreetly?</strong></p>
<p>Of course. The packaging we use is completely discreet so that only you will be aware of the exciting experience that awaits inside each box.</p>
<p><strong>What are the shipping charges and where do you ship?</strong></p>
<p>For pledges under $125, shipping is calculated based on weight and location. All pledges above $125 include FREE shipping.</p>
<p>We ship to the United States and Canada; at this time we do not ship internationally.</p>
<p><strong>Can I back this project anonymously?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, IndieGoGo allows the option to donate money to a project without including your contact information. When you’re ready to make your donation, check the box that says “Don’t display my name on the campaign page.”</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498149501/psmlaucgzbggklze3dey.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>I’ve only used my [sexytimes product] once, can I return it?</strong></p>
<p>So sorry, once it’s touched your box (or any other area), it can’t go back into its box. We’ll ship a replacement for defective products, but otherwise all sales are final.</p>
<p><strong>But what if I haven’t opened my product and it’s still in the original packaging? Can I return it then?</strong></p>
<p>Nope, all sales really are final. If you can’t make that toy your best friend, share the love and give it to your best friend!</p>
<p><strong>How about refunds?</strong></p>
<p>If there is an issue with your order or account, we would be happy to help you resolve the situation which may include a refund in certain scenarios. However, we do not offer refunds once the products have been received.</p>
<p><strong>I’m a little nervous… or new… or… is this going to be too much for me?</strong></p>
<p>Being a bit nervous is totally natural. Everyone comes to The Nooky Box with different levels of experience and comfort. We’ve curated each box so you can feel confident in the experience as a whole. All of our boxes are appropriate for beginner-level sexploration, but the toys are advanced enough to please even the most seasoned veterans.</p>
<p><strong>Can I buy for someone else?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! Signature boxes make excellent (and seductive) gifts.</p>
<p><strong>I’m single; can I still get in on the Nooky action?</strong></p>
<p>We certainly think so! Other folks are fun to play with, but being single doesn’t need to be a barrier to pleasure. Many of our collections and featured toys are amazing for solo play as well as with a partner. Here at The Nooky Box we strongly encourage all folks to get curious about their own intimate terrain. Knowledge is power, after all, and you’ll be a much more informed guide the next time you do have a playmate.</p>
<p><strong>Do you take requests?</strong></p>
<p>We like to consider ourselves good, giving and game. At the very least, we’re always open to suggestions. If you have a great one, we’d love to try and work out the logistics to make it happen. Drop us a line to see what we can do about making your fantasy a reality!</p>
<h2>Thank you!</h2>

</div></div>","Our Launch Story

When The Nooky Box had its concept launch in 2015, we introduced our original subscription service with our first crowdfunding campaign that raised over $10,000. We had a vision of curating sexual experiences for every body - and it’s still our mission’s core today.
We believe in making pleasure accessible and fun for all genders, sexual orientations and relationship structures. Sex toys are fun and healthy, and we think that’s what sex should be too.

Our backers agreed then, and we think you still do now!

Sifting through the endless options of available toys can be time-consuming, expensive and oftentimes leads to disappointment and frustration. The sex toy market is saturated with inferior products and suppliers who prioritize their profits over your body’s health and safety. The prospect of navigating this online maze can be daunting.
Boxes That Come Again & Again...

Don't worry, we got you!
For The Nooky Box team of professional pleasure-hunters, sourcing the best products is our full-time occupation - and we love our jobs. Our sexual health experts and guest curators consistently find the most unique, well-designed toys and reliable products available. Then we bring them to you in one discreetly delivered package every three months!
Our quarterly boxes give you enough time to experiment with each collection before the next one arrives, but that doesn’t mean you won’t be counting the days till you see your next package in the post.

Signature Series: Coming Evolution

It’s been almost two years since our first crowdfunding campaign, where our community of backers helped launch The Nooky Box with 71% of our overall funding goal. Many of our original backers are now satisfied customers. Their feedback and overwhelming support has been critical to the foundation and growth of our company.
""Well, it’s safe to say I have a new favorite Adult Subscription Box. I certainly wasn’t expecting to love this box as much as I do. My very first The Nooky Box was a total success.""-Sarah Zimmerman | A Year Of Box
Thank you. Seriously, you’re the reason we’re here.
Since then, we’ve evolved our vision of what The Nooky Box can provide and how we can better participate in the cultural conversations around sexual health and pleasure. We’re expanding to include a one-stop online marketplace for reliably amazing adult toys from Nooky-approved manufacturers.
The Nooky Subscription Box isn’t going anywhere; we’re passionate about continually introducing our customers to new toys and products that expand their sexual palette and experiences. That being said, there’s nothing wrong with knowing exactly what you want!
If you’ve got a particular itch you’re dying to scratch, the Signature Box lineup is here to serve those desires directly.

You spoke. We listened.
The Nooky Signature Boxes are here to fill the gap between your fantasies and the bedroom. While our customers love the subscription box, we realize that it’s not the perfect solution for everyone’s sex life; so we developed a line of stand-alone boxes, each curated with a unique spectrum of experiences in mind.
Our Signature line will be consistently available in our online store, so that our customers can choose to purchase one (or more) at a time. Each focuses on a different theme worthy of your attention and exploration; and can be selected based on your particular interests and intentions. We’re launching with 8 boxes but have even more in mind!
Help our campaign reach our stretch goals to find out what else is coming to the Signature Line!

Project Timeline


FAQs

How are the Nooky Signature Boxes different from the Nooky Subscription Boxes?
We’re launching our Signature line with this campaign, which includes eight curated collections (with more added as stretch goals!) that’ll be consistently available for purchase via our website. In contrast, subscriptions ship every three months and the contents are a surprise each quarter.
Will I still receive my perk Signature Box if you don't meet your funding goal?
Yes! We are committed to keeping our promises to our backers. We chose a flexible funding goal, and are confident in our capacity to fulfill all rewards even if the unthinkable happens, and we don't quite meet our goal.
Will my Nooky Box be shipped discreetly?
Of course. The packaging we use is completely discreet so that only you will be aware of the exciting experience that awaits inside each box.
What are the shipping charges and where do you ship?
For pledges under $125, shipping is calculated based on weight and location. All pledges above $125 include FREE shipping.
We ship to the United States and Canada; at this time we do not ship internationally.
Can I back this project anonymously?
Yes, IndieGoGo allows the option to donate money to a project without including your contact information. When you’re ready to make your donation, check the box that says “Don’t display my name on the campaign page.”

I’ve only used my [sexytimes product] once, can I return it?
So sorry, once it’s touched your box (or any other area), it can’t go back into its box. We’ll ship a replacement for defective products, but otherwise all sales are final.
But what if I haven’t opened my product and it’s still in the original packaging? Can I return it then?
Nope, all sales really are final. If you can’t make that toy your best friend, share the love and give it to your best friend!
How about refunds?
If there is an issue with your order or account, we would be happy to help you resolve the situation which may include a refund in certain scenarios. However, we do not offer refunds once the products have been received.
I’m a little nervous… or new… or… is this going to be too much for me?
Being a bit nervous is totally natural. Everyone comes to The Nooky Box with different levels of experience and comfort. We’ve curated each box so you can feel confident in the experience as a whole. All of our boxes are appropriate for beginner-level sexploration, but the toys are advanced enough to please even the most seasoned veterans.
Can I buy for someone else?
Absolutely! Signature boxes make excellent (and seductive) gifts.
I’m single; can I still get in on the Nooky action?
We certainly think so! Other folks are fun to play with, but being single doesn’t need to be a barrier to pleasure. Many of our collections and featured toys are amazing for solo play as well as with a partner. Here at The Nooky Box we strongly encourage all folks to get curious about their own intimate terrain. Knowledge is power, after all, and you’ll be a much more informed guide the next time you do have a playmate.
Do you take requests?
We like to consider ourselves good, giving and game. At the very least, we’re always open to suggestions. If you have a great one, we’d love to try and work out the logistics to make it happen. Drop us a line to see what we can do about making your fantasy a reality!
Thank you!

CARE
There were high hopes for the electric
toothbrush when it was created in 1954. It was expected to change daily dental
care with an easier, more effective way to care for the teeth. Yet the electric
toothbrush never converted consumers. Despite billions of dollars spent on
marketing efforts, only 31% of
Americans have switched over to the electric toothbrush! Though the electric
toothbrush fell short of its expectations, the design, and therefore its
performance, has not significantly improved since its creation. It’s time for a
change.REVOLUTIONARY SOLUTIONS THAT
OFFER INNOVATION IN 3 MAIN AREAS
FOREO has conceptualized what the original electric toothbrush
should have been right from the very start - by designing the entire concept
from scratch focusing on 3 main areas of
innovation.NEW MATERIAL
· Soft and flexible silicone is completely
nonabrasive to make it impossible to apply too much pressure, preventing gum
recession and sensitivity in teeth, both of which are the most common dental
issues
· Silicone is nonporous so it doesn’t absorb any
microbes for hygienic bristles
· Silicone bristles combined with high-intensity
pulsations provide ultra-gentle yet effective dental careNEW FORM
· Far more durable than standard electric
toothbrushes, requires no replacement brush heads for 1 year
· Integrated battery lasts an astonishing 365 uses
per each full charge and only takes 1 hour to fully charge
· Compact, lightweight and easy to take on your
travels
· Vibrant and visually appealing designNEW FUNCTIONALITY
· 
Silicone bristles clean plaque in a completely
different way that eliminates the issue of finding optimal pressure; these
bristles use friction instead of a scratching action to effectively remove bio-film
and other impurities from the mouth
· 
Longer and wider brush head covers much more
surface area with every stroke
· 
Bi-directional brush bristle design makes it
possible to clean efficiently between the teeth
· 
3D flexibility in the ergonomic brush head
adapts to any tooth surface and curves to the shape of your mouth to reach
every creviceTHE ISSA™ RANGE 
ISSA™
The ISSA™’s 8-speed
interface allows users to customize the frequency of pulsations to suit
their sensitivity requirements. Every 30 seconds, the ISSA™ will pulse rapidly,
indicating it is time to clean a different quadrant of your mouth, and after 2
minutes it will pulse again to signify the end of the dental care routine. The
ISSA™ lasts up to 365 uses per full
charge. Brush heads need to be replaced only once yearly, at a cost of $15 each.ISSA™ mini
The child-friendly ISSA™ mini has all of the benefits of the
ISSA™, with the added addition of parental
controls to ensure twice-daily brushings. If the user has not brushed for
over 12 hours, the sad face will appear while the happy face will light up
after the user has brushed for 2 minutes. The ISSA™ mini has 2 speeds and lasts up to 200 uses per full charge. Brush heads
need to be replaced only once yearly, at a cost of $15 each.  ISSA™ Luxe
For those wanting to indulge
in the epitome of opulence, the Limited Edition ISSA™ Luxe range is for you.
The ISSA™ Gold has an 18-karat gold base
and comes in Royal Purple, and the Limited Edition ISSA™ Platinum has a solid platinum base and comes in Black,

<h3>We like to think we are in control. We like to think of our homes as a bastion of safety. We, however, are deeply WRONG...</h3>
<p>Everyday new refineries are being built. More coal burned. Traffic expecting to double. Steel at an all time high. Cattle growing exponentially. Pollution is set to become more devastating than ever... What can one family do??</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCING; A Prototype To Save Lives!</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Wall Rendering"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1325.photobucket.com/albums/u635/alex1490/UnitRendering_zps9872c034.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>

<p>How does Children's Health First plan on saving millions? With a revolutionary new product that acts like an air purifier but is significantly more effective. Using a revolutionary technology to virtually ELIMINATE 90%+ of all indoor pollution. Not just large dust particles but DEADLY Infectous Diseases and VOC's (Volatile Organic Compounds.) Did you know cigarette smoke is invisible? But... if its invisible, why do we see huge clouds? Answer is VOC's. Yes that entire cloud consists of millions of Volatile Organic Compounds that reflect light to create the cloud. This scary negatively charged cloud sticks to anything positive charged (Children!) Making cigarette smoke one of our specialty test subjects!</p>
<p>It may seem slightly confusing but main point to consider is size of particles affecting our health see diagram below</p>
<p>      <img alt=""Dust Atmosphere"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1325.photobucket.com/albums/u635/alex1490/TypicalAtmosphericDustSample_zps29a4c49a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most important thing to take from this chart is the Effective range of most HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems. Notice that although they effectively remove 91% of elements larger than 3.0pm (paticulate matter.) They are completely worthless when helping with VOC's, infectious diseases, and problematic elements smaller than 3.0pm. Second, notice that a <strong>WHOOPING 99.57%</strong> of all airborne particles are smaller than effective range of 3.0pm. Whats this mean? That ridiculously expensive HVAC systems and HEPA filters do absolutely nothing to protect us against the VOC's and Infectous Diseases that are KILLING US!</p>
<p>  <img alt=""pyramid health effects"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1325.photobucket.com/albums/u635/alex1490/Pyramid-ExposureHealthEffects_zpsde3ee7c6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Why are our health costs so outrageous?</h3>
<p>Consider the previous chart. Air pollution affects every aspect of human civilization. If an individual has Asthma, how difficult can it be to exercise? If children miss school, school funding decreases. If your missing work, how can you provide for your family? If your hospitalized with Respiratory Symptoms, can you be an effective member of society? People are dying everyday from pollution and disease induced symptoms. This is causing our healthcare costs to explode. At moment <strong>NOTHING</strong> can help an individual who develops an extreme case of pollution poisoning.</p>
<p><strong>Children's Health First believes an ounce of prevention is better than TONS of cure!</strong><br/><br/></p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Phase 2 Begins Now!</h3>
<p>Children's Health First is ecstatic to begin the next chapter in protecting the public! <br/>Currently we are seeking donors to help make this product a reality. We have invested years and thousands of dollars to create the rough functioning product. After extensive testing the rough product blew away all of our expectations. Embaressing HEPA filter systems, Shaming HVAC systems, and these units ran from $700-$10,000 with filter replacements upwards of $1,000! (See Test Results Below)</p>

<h3>Prototype Funding</h3>
<p>Although we are very excited about results we have no intention of stopping there. Current prototype designs plan of improving functionality by 60%, efficiency by 30%, and air flow by 70%.</p>
<p>The prototype process will consist of 5 steps; Shell Design, Air Flow management, Filter Structure, Power Components, and additional elements (remote controlled, timer features.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Shell Creation- Options Include; Aluminum, Plastic, Steel, Carbon Fibre and Fibre Glass </li>
<li>Air Flow- This consists of 11 different Air Flow units. (Air flow importance; higher airflow more effective filtration but also higher cost)</li>
<li>Filter Structure- 9 Options and filter styles. (All filtration units currently use 1 filter, we plan on implementing a 2-4 filter set-up increasing functionality)</li>
<li>Power Components- Electrical aspects of this device will greatly determine overall effective filtration. We plan on wall mount, ceiling mount, stand alone. All will have different electrical aspects.</li>
<li>Additional Elements- Remote controlled aka ceiling units or wall mounts. Timer; auto on/off options. Color options. Fast filter reloading system.</li>

</div></div>","We are dying, Pollution is at an all time Extreme...
           Help is Near...
We like to think we are in control. We like to think of our homes as a bastion of safety. We, however, are deeply WRONG...
Everyday new refineries are being built. More coal burned. Traffic expecting to double. Steel at an all time high. Cattle growing exponentially. Pollution is set to become more devastating than ever... What can one family do??
INTRODUCING; A Prototype To Save Lives!

 
How does Children's Health First plan on saving millions? With a revolutionary new product that acts like an air purifier but is significantly more effective. Using a revolutionary technology to virtually ELIMINATE 90%+ of all indoor pollution. Not just large dust particles but DEADLY Infectous Diseases and VOC's (Volatile Organic Compounds.) Did you know cigarette smoke is invisible? But... if its invisible, why do we see huge clouds? Answer is VOC's. Yes that entire cloud consists of millions of Volatile Organic Compounds that reflect light to create the cloud. This scary negatively charged cloud sticks to anything positive charged (Children!) Making cigarette smoke one of our specialty test subjects!
It may seem slightly confusing but main point to consider is size of particles affecting our health see diagram below
      
 
Most important thing to take from this chart is the Effective range of most HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems. Notice that although they effectively remove 91% of elements larger than 3.0pm (paticulate matter.) They are completely worthless when helping with VOC's, infectious diseases, and problematic elements smaller than 3.0pm. Second, notice that a WHOOPING 99.57% of all airborne particles are smaller than effective range of 3.0pm. Whats this mean? That ridiculously expensive HVAC systems and HEPA filters do absolutely nothing to protect us against the VOC's and Infectous Diseases that are KILLING US!
  
Why are our health costs so outrageous?
Consider the previous chart. Air pollution affects every aspect of human civilization. If an individual has Asthma, how difficult can it be to exercise? If children miss school, school funding decreases. If your missing work, how can you provide for your family? If your hospitalized with Respiratory Symptoms, can you be an effective member of society? People are dying everyday from pollution and disease induced symptoms. This is causing our healthcare costs to explode. At moment NOTHING can help an individual who develops an extreme case of pollution poisoning.
Children's Health First believes an ounce of prevention is better than TONS of cure!

 
Phase 2 Begins Now!
Children's Health First is ecstatic to begin the next chapter in protecting the public! Currently we are seeking donors to help make this product a reality. We have invested years and thousands of dollars to create the rough functioning product. After extensive testing the rough product blew away all of our expectations. Embaressing HEPA filter systems, Shaming HVAC systems, and these units ran from $700-$10,000 with filter replacements upwards of $1,000! (See Test Results Below)

<p>Although KaKa is designed and ready for distribution, we still need funds to put into, manufacture, build moulds, printer boards, various other production material, and paying for use of the factory itself. We’d like to offer as many incentives as possible for those who are able to contribute the money we will need to make this happen. The funds gathered from this campaign will take our working prototypes and begin large-scale product, as well a sand go towards letting the world know that this solution exists. The more we can produce in a single run, the cheaper the price per unit will be! Take advantage of the special low prices we are offering during this campaign, because you won’t always be able to get KaKa this cheap. </p>

KaKa is a revolutionary way to remind yourself about the most important tasks throughout the day, regardless of where you go or what you need to get done. It is a portable, ball-shaped voice recorder that allows you to store personalized messages and automatically activate them wherever you are, according to your specific needs. Record any message up to 60 seconds long, and play it back with high definition audio as a reminder to yourself, a message to someone else, or even a bedtime story for your kids while you are away. 








KaKa is as beautiful as it is functional. At only 65mm in diameter, it is totally portable, and comes equipped with blue and red LED light indicators. Upon pressing record, KaKa will begin blinking with a red LED light, which will last for up to 60 seconds before the recording is stopped. During playback, a blue LED light is activated, making KaKa beautiful and decorative to use. It looks like it comes from the future, and will be equally at home among professionals or casual users. The battery lasts around five days with typical use, and can be recharged through a micro USB cable.  

                                                         
The sensors in KaKa can be activated in four different ways: through motion, voice, vibration, or light. The possible uses are endless. 






•Use KaKa’s magnetic touch points to fix the orb near a dangerous spot like a wet floor. KaKa’s motion sensor will activate it whenever someone walks by, audibly warning them of the situation and preventing an injury. An ambient warning is much more effective than a simple sign, which can easily go unseen. 


•entrance to greet important guests with information they need to know. KaKa enhances your Place it on your desk at the office to provide audio playback of an important note, or at an ability to communicate, act a security alarm when intruders are present, or even as a “smart” doorbell.


•Place it in a box containing fragile objects, and it will activate whenever the box is shaken too hard. An audible reminder will prevent those handling it from damaging the content.


•Reminder yourself with recorded instructions to take daily medication, or record a set of complicated instructions when you can’t remember. 


How You Can Help



Although KaKa is designed and ready for distribution, we still need funds to put into, manufacture, build moulds, printer boards, various other production material, and paying for use of the factory itself. We’d like to offer as many incentives as possible for those who are able to contribute the money we will need to make this happen. The funds gathered from this campaign will take our working prototypes and begin large-scale product, as well a sand go towards letting the world know that this solution exists. The more we can produce in a single run, the cheaper the price per unit will be! Take advantage of the special low prices we are offering during this campaign, because you won’t always be able to get KaKa this cheap. 




Tell Your Friends

Our mission is to give smart, useful gadgets to everyone, and the empower people who need help remembering things and living with greater care. It doesn’t matter if they are a friend, family member, lover, or a coworker at the office.





If you’ve ever wished it was easier to share important messages and be reminded of what matters, then you should already see the enormous value of KaKa. We’d like to serve as an inspiration for other entrepreneurs and startup enterprises to get out there and release their innovations to the world through the crowdfunding model. We know a lot of people who need a solution like this, so tell your friends to contribute so we can promote it to the world.

Like most new golfers, I struggled with the game; especially with putting. The flat-faced putter I used seemed to have too many variables involved to hit it correctly and consistently.  One day, looking at the Newton’s Cradle sitting on my desk, I wondered why putters weren’t round-faced.  The Cradle demonstrates momentum but clearly illustrates a ball hitting a ball of the same size will always hit that ball at its center of gravity; and isn’t that what we’re trying to do on the course?
I set out to develop and test my theory and after years of study and prototype development - introduced the MxV1 putter at this year’s PGA Show.  
Others, who have attempted to create a round-faced putter, have never achieved a scientifically proven true roll with every stroke - our Center Strike Technology® - inherent in the patent-pending MxV1 putter. Our testing has proven to outperform the #1 putter currently on tour.
The MxV1 putter conforms to both USGA and R&A Rules of Golf making it a legal club in tournament play throughout the world!
 
The Challenge
Entry into the Golf industry can be an expensive undertaking - the “big boys” out buy and out spend all independent producers like myself. They occupy the media, retail, and sponsorships - all touches. If not for the accolades, data and customer responses I’ve received so far - I might have surrendered to them, and given up.
The MxV1 needs your help to survive. 
 
What We Need
Our stretch goal is $250K to ensure a properly funded go-to-market strategy implementation, one that will compete with the “big boys.”  
Raising our intermediate goal of $50K is needed to increase product awareness through aggressive online advertising, trade show, road tour gorilla marketing, advertising and promotion opportunities. Funding is also needed to further pursue market and MxV product research and development, hire appropriate talent to execute on the business plan, and scale up manufacturing capacity to reduce overall costs.
We see the following funding milestones:
First $10K – will launch a direct response television test – reaching more than 1 million viewers.
Next $15K – will create an inside sales team, reaching out to the on-course pro shops, developing the retail relationships that will get the club “into the hands” of the golfer, and lower scores on the scorecard.
And the next $25K will be used to continue creating brand strength one-on-one with our customers, through on-course demo days.
 
Design, performance, science and guarantee make up the MxV1’s competitive advantages.
A major pain point with recreational golfers is the dreaded 3-putt.
According to Average Golfer “A golfer that averages a score of 100 hits 0 greens in regulation, 11% of fairways, has 38.3 putts, 0 birdies, and 1.3 pars”. - http://averagegolfer1.blogspot.com/2008/06/aver...
Common putting mistakes include a lack of confidence, uneven strokes, no putting routine, and worry about outcome, i.e. the accuracy of the roll.
There has not been any significant advances in putter design or technology in quite some time. The major manufacturers are slow to respond to new ideas and have been producing obscure, often bizarre models under the guise of the “latest” this or that. None have... until now!  
By its design and preferred stroke technique (sole, press, sweep) the MxV1 putter creates a relaxed routine with a smooth, free-swinging pendulum motion. Coupled with its Center Strike Technology®, the putter builds confidence by increasing accuracy.
The MxV1 with Center Strike Technology® (CST) is scientifically proven to outperform both the Odyssey Two-Ball and Nike Method putters by 6%. 
MxV1 offers true roll (no backspin), which gets the ball rolling immediately off the face for more accurate putting (lower scores).
If your MxV1 putter should fail due to a manufacturer defect (not direct abuse) we will replace the head free of charge less shipping.

Running has benefited me not only physically, but mentally. It has helped me navigate some of the toughest times of my life, and has rapidly become a sacred part of my day. I thought of this documentary when I began to wonder how old most people are when they stop running. When do they hang up their shoes and take up something a little more sedate?  Is there any age when they’re forced to do so? I did a little research and found out a simple and wonderful truth: some people NEVER give it up.

After interviewing many older runners in Tampa, FL we were hooked. We were also convinced that this topic would make an incredible documentary.  </p><p><strong>WHAT WE LEARNED</strong>:</p><p>Age is only a barrier if you let it be. It’s not an excuse for not exercising. On the contrary, it’s the best reason TO exercise! We’re certainly not proposing that everyone go out and run a marathon tomorrow. What we ARE proposing is that everyone should get moving one way or another: a walk, a bike ride, surfing, scuba, golf, basketball, pinochle (even though in good faith I have to admit I don’t really know what that is). If the people we met can get up and run a 10K every day, then you can certainly take the stairs instead of the escalator. Ask your doctor what kind of exercise would be good for you, and then do it!</p><p><strong>OUR MESSAGE</strong>:</p><p>Why do we feel that this such an important message? According to the U.S Census Bureau, 40.3 million Americans are age 65 and older. That number is expected to more than double to 89 million by 2050. According to Dr. James Fries from the Stanford University School of Medicine, exercise is the single best way to elongate the active and vital years of life and decrease the total amount of lifetime disability. Dr. Fries conducted a thirteen-year study involving 528 runners and 423 non-runners, and the results were amazing. His study showed that running actually delays age-related disabilities by almost two decades and that runners are seven times less likely to require knee replacement. Contrary to popular belief, running doesn't lead to increased hip, back or knee problems and prevents fractures of the hips and spine. But his biggest finding? Runners are half as likely as non-runners to die early.</p><p>His study:                                                                                                                   <a href=""https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2008/08/running-slows-the-aging-clock-stanford-researchers-find.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2008/08/running-slows-the-aging-clock-stanford-researchers-find.html</a></p><p>Our country, unlike many others, tends to discard people after they’ve reached their imaginary use-by date. We want to show that people can still accomplish extraordinary things as they get older.</p><p><strong>OUR DOCUMENTARY</strong>:</p><p>We’d like to travel the country and track four or five runners in different states – all over the age of 50 – as they each train for the hardest race of their lives. One runner will be doing the Space Race Marathon in FL, another will be doing a 5K Turkey Trot, and yet another will be conquering the Hardrock 100 Mile Race in Silverton, CO. -- the hardest 100 miler in the country <i>because it’s all above 10,000 feet</i>. They will each be approaching said race with a different goal: beating their last time, conquering their first run of this length, tackling a health issue, continuing a weight loss program, etc. In this way, we will provide a glimpse of many different experiences. We will also meet the people involved in their stories: friends, family, doctors, running clubs, etc. Again, our goal is to show that no one is too old to get moving.</p><p><strong>THE TEAM</strong>:</p><p><strong>LIZ VASSEY (EXECUTIVE PRODUCER/DIRECTOR):</strong></p><p>At sixteen, Liz joined the cast of ALL MY CHILDREN. For her work on that show, she was nominated for a Daytime Emmy. Since then, Liz has appeared as a regular or recurring character on eleven television shows including ER, MAXIMUM BOB, NECESSARY ROUGHNESS, BROTHERLY LOVE, PUSH NEVADA, TWO AND A HALF MEN, and FOX’s live action version of THE TICK. But she is probably best known for her five year run on CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION as DNA technician “Wendy Simms.” In addition to acting, Liz is a very accomplished writer.

Well…we started out with that intention, actually. However, after flying to Florida to shoot two short videos on our own dime, we realized that this is not an inexpensive passion project. At least not if we want to achieve the level of quality we’re aiming for. We have already spent thousands of our dollars, but in order to keep going…<i>we need your help</i>.</p><p>My guess is your second question might be: since you have been in the business for a while, why not get this set up at a production company? Why not use your connections? Well…we tried that, too. And we learned two things…</p><p>First of all, as you may have noticed on reality television, conflict sells. Several companies were interested, but asked if we could dial up the drama. For instance, it was suggested that maybe our runners could be in a “Biggest Loser” type competition to lose weight. Or that maybe several of them could be working their way through an argument while they’re stuck in the same running club. This is not the documentary we want to make. We want this to be inspirational. We want to show what is possible at any stage of life. We believe the everyday human struggles these people are naturally grappling with will provide drama enough without fabricating more. And mostly we believe, particularly now, that there’s an audience for a movie imbued with HOPE.</p><p>Second, this is Los Angeles. We don’t think we have to expound on the fact that ageism is a big issue here. Telling people you want to make a full-length documentary centered on a group of people in their 50’s-90’s doesn’t exactly set the room on fire. <u>We think they’re wrong</u>. We believe there is an audience for a documentary that is not only centered on this sorely underrepresented demographic, but also shows them in the stone cold badass light they deserve to be shown in. <i>But we need help putting such an “un-Hollywood” message out there. </i></p><p><strong>WHERE YOUR DONATIONS WILL GO</strong>:</p><p>Here are just a few things your donations would help secure:</p><p>- GoPros (or similar small cameras) for the runners so we can get their individual POV’s</p><p>- Plane tickets so we can interview runners all around the country</p><p>- Hotels – so we can, you know, sleep</p><p>- Camera equipment rental</p><p>- Sound equipment rental</p><p>- Hiring a sound crew</p><p>- Editing</p><p>- Color correction</p><p>- Sound mixing</p><p>- Marketing</p><p>- Promotion</p><p>- Advertising</p><p>- Music rights</p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>-- Even if you can't contribute with a monetary donation - there's TONS of other ways to support THE HUMAN RACE!</p><p>-- Share the hashtag - #humanracedoc</p><p>-- Follow us on twitter - @humanracedoc</p><p>-- Follow us on Facebook - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TheHumanRaceDoc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/TheHumanRaceDoc/</a></p><p>-- Tell your friends!</p><p> </p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TheHumanRaceDoc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484636632/wppuozg2rpkpt1hkfqa3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484637561/iudjrmzr3lapfnki3fhl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484703077/pofxb6elf6mpi8knyxrd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p></div>","OUR MISSION:This feature-length documentary will follow five runners over the age of 50 for a three-month period as each one trains for his or her first 5K, 10K, half marathon, marathon, or ultra marathon.

After interviewing many older runners in Tampa, FL we were hooked. We were also convinced that this topic would make an incredible documentary.  WHAT WE LEARNED:Age is only a barrier if you let it be. It’s not an excuse for not exercising. On the contrary, it’s the best reason TO exercise! We’re certainly not proposing that everyone go out and run a marathon tomorrow. What we ARE proposing is that everyone should get moving one way or another: a walk, a bike ride, surfing, scuba, golf, basketball, pinochle (even though in good faith I have to admit I don’t really know what that is). If the people we met can get up and run a 10K every day, then you can certainly take the stairs instead of the escalator. Ask your doctor what kind of exercise would be good for you, and then do it!OUR MESSAGE:Why do we feel that this such an important message? According to the U.S Census Bureau, 40.3 million Americans are age 65 and older. That number is expected to more than double to 89 million by 2050. According to Dr. James Fries from the Stanford University School of Medicine, exercise is the single best way to elongate the active and vital years of life and decrease the total amount of lifetime disability. Dr. Fries conducted a thirteen-year study involving 528 runners and 423 non-runners, and the results were amazing. His study showed that running actually delays age-related disabilities by almost two decades and that runners are seven times less likely to require knee replacement. Contrary to popular belief, running doesn't lead to increased hip, back or knee problems and prevents fractures of the hips and spine. But his biggest finding? Runners are half as likely as non-runners to die early.His study:                                                                                                                   https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2008/08/running-slows-the-aging-clock-stanford-researchers-find.htmlOur country, unlike many others, tends to discard people after they’ve reached their imaginary use-by date. We want to show that people can still accomplish extraordinary things as they get older.OUR DOCUMENTARY:We’d like to travel the country and track four or five runners in different states – all over the age of 50 – as they each train for the hardest race of their lives. One runner will be doing the Space Race Marathon in FL, another will be doing a 5K Turkey Trot, and yet another will be conquering the Hardrock 100 Mile Race in Silverton, CO. -- the hardest 100 miler in the country because it’s all above 10,000 feet. They will each be approaching said race with a different goal: beating their last time, conquering their first run of this length, tackling a health issue, continuing a weight loss program, etc. In this way, we will provide a glimpse of many different experiences. We will also meet the people involved in their stories: friends, family, doctors, running clubs, etc. Again, our goal is to show that no one is too old to get moving.THE TEAM:LIZ VASSEY (EXECUTIVE PRODUCER/DIRECTOR):At sixteen, Liz joined the cast of ALL MY CHILDREN. For her work on that show, she was nominated for a Daytime Emmy. Since then, Liz has appeared as a regular or recurring character on eleven television shows including ER, MAXIMUM BOB, NECESSARY ROUGHNESS, BROTHERLY LOVE, PUSH NEVADA, TWO AND A HALF MEN, and FOX’s live action version of THE TICK. But she is probably best known for her five year run on CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION as DNA technician “Wendy Simms.” In addition to acting, Liz is a very accomplished writer. She co-wrote an episode of CSI in the tenth season. She has sold six television pilots and a TV movie, developing for such networks and studios as NBC, Freeform, Universal, Imagine, and Sony.DAVID EMMERICHS (DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY):David specializes in Steadicam and has worked on on films like AVATAR, TRANSFORMERS, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, THE GREEN MILE, SEVEN, and many others.David has had the opportunity to learn from many of the best directors in the business including: Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Oliver Stone, David Fincher, Michael Bay, Tony Scott, and Mike Nichols. More recently, David has worked as the Director of Photography on the feature film OUIJA, and as the 2nd Unit Director of Photography on TRIPLE 9 and XXX3: THE RETURN OF XANDER CAGE.JULIET GRAY (EXECUTIVE PRODUCER):Juliet Gray is Artistic Director of the Key West Theater and Program Director of The Performing Arts Project, both nonprofit organizations that she also cofounded. This past year, she has produced the musical SILENCE! the world premiere of the play LOCURA, the short film FRANCES EATON: THE UNTOLD STORY OF A WORLD CHAMPION, as well as numerous other shows and fundraisers including the annual island-wide Tropic Cinema 72-Hour Film Challenge in Key West and LET ME TRY THAT AGAIN at 54 Below in NYC. In addition to her producing career, Juliet has written more than 1,000 articles for AOL, DELTA SKY, GLAMOUR, and NBC, among others, and a travel book on the Florida Keys published by Globe Pequot Press.DEBBIE VOILES (EXECUTIVE PRODUCER): At 63, with two running podcasts and three websites, Debbie reaches runners around the world while enjoying the daily camaraderie of the local Run Tampa Club she founded. Completing her first marathon at 54 and her first 50k a few years later, she's running and racing more than ever, but her top priority is convincing others her age - and everyone approaching her age - that running is the fountain of youth, that it will enable them to stretch out midlife while enjoying a quality of life that would make many thirty-somethings jealous.Beginner Runner Village Podcast:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/beginner-runner-village/id709745888?mt=2Mojo for Running:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/mojo-for-running/id340815181?mt=2WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:My guess is your first question might be: why not finance this yourselves? Well…we started out with that intention, actually. However, after flying to Florida to shoot two short videos on our own dime, we realized that this is not an inexpensive passion project. At least not if we want to achieve the level of quality we’re aiming for. We have already spent thousands of our dollars, but in order to keep going…we need your help.My guess is your second question might be: since you have been in the business for a while, why not get this set up at a production company? Why not use your connections? Well…we tried that, too. And we learned two things…First of all, as you may have noticed on reality television, conflict sells. Several companies were interested, but asked if we could dial up the drama. For instance, it was suggested that maybe our runners could be in a “Biggest Loser” type competition to lose weight. Or that maybe several of them could be working their way through an argument while they’re stuck in the same running club. This is not the documentary we want to make. We want this to be inspirational. We want to show what is possible at any stage of life. We believe the everyday human struggles these people are naturally grappling with will provide drama enough without fabricating more. And mostly we believe, particularly now, that there’s an audience for a movie imbued with HOPE.Second, this is Los Angeles. We don’t think we have to expound on the fact that ageism is a big issue here. Telling people you want to make a full-length documentary centered on a group of people in their 50’s-90’s doesn’t exactly set the room on fire. We think they’re wrong. We believe there is an audience for a documentary that is not only centered on this sorely underrepresented demographic, but also shows them in the stone cold badass light they deserve to be shown in. But we need help putting such an “un-Hollywood” message out there. WHERE YOUR DONATIONS WILL GO:Here are just a few things your donations would help secure:- GoPros (or similar small cameras) for the runners so we can get their individual POV’s- Plane tickets so we can interview runners all around the country- Hotels – so we can, you know, sleep- Camera equipment rental- Sound equipment rental- Hiring a sound crew- Editing- Color correction- Sound mixing- Marketing- Promotion- Advertising- Music rightsOther Ways You Can Help-- Even if you can't contribute with a monetary donation - there's TONS of other ways to support THE HUMAN RACE!-- Share the hashtag - #humanracedoc-- Follow us on twitter - @humanracedoc-- Follow us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/TheHumanRaceDoc/-- Tell your friends!",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

enlarged prostate during their lives. Some of these men start having problems as early as 30 years old. The reason
we don't hear about this epidemic more often is that culturally, we are a society that shies away from
discussing prostate issues. </p>
<p>Most cases of enlarged prostates are
referred to as BPH for benign prostatic hyperplasia. But when left untreated,
BPH is nothing but benign.  Starting with annoyances like frequent
urination and inability to urinate completely, BPH can lead to urinary tract
infections and sometimes even kidney failure and catherizations. </p>
<p>Because men don't like to talk about
their prostate problems or go see their doctor about them, odds are good that

<p>With our product, men can self-test
for potential prostate issues by simply urinating into the single-use device in
the comfort of their homes, when they want to. Once men know their current prostate
risk level, they can make an informed decision about whether to seek further
medical help. US clinical tests have shown our product to be as accurate as

Hierfür <br/>müssen sie allerdings eine Gegenleistung erbringen. Sie müssen bereit sein zu <br/>lernen. Das Ziel der Trainer für jedes ihrer Kids ist, dass sie einen <br/>Schulabschluss erhalten um anschließend die Möglichkeit zu haben, eine Ausbildung oder sogar ein Studium zu beginnen. <br/>Weitere Ziele sind, die Kids aus dem Sumpf von Drogen, Alkohol und <br/>Kriminalität herauszuholen, ihnen Disziplin, Respekt beizubringen und Englisch zu lernen.  <br/></p><p><b>Wie kann Ultimate das ermöglichen? </b><br/>Die Trainer der Kids sind nicht einfach nur ihre Trainer. Sie sind ihre Familie, sie <br/>unterstützen sie in allen Lebensbereichen, fördern sie und geben ihnen das Gefühl, <br/>dass sie einen Wert haben, obwohl sie aus den Slums stammen. <br/>Sie unterrichten die Kids in ihrer Freizeit und motivieren sie immer wieder, sich in ihrem Leben Ziele zu setzen – hohe Ziele.  <br/>Die Trainer, die selbst studiert haben oder “gute Berufe” (u.a. auch als Schauspieler) ausüben, nehmen alle Kids in ihren Teams auf. Unabhängig von Kaste (das indische Kastensystem existiert immer noch in den Köpfen vieler Menschen), Religion, Hautfarbe, Kultur, Nationalität und Geschlecht. Von Anfang an wurde Ultimate in Indien in der Mixed Division ausgetragen. Entgegen der gesamten Stellung der Frauen in Indien, wird das weibliche Geschlecht beim Ultimate gleichgestellt und respektiert. <br/>Die Kids selbst werden durch Ultimate selbstbewusster, lernen Verantwortung für ihr eigenes Leben zu übernehmen und ebenfalls auf andere zu achten. Trotz ihres <br/>täglichen Lebenskampfs in den Slums lernen sie, sich nicht mehr gegenseitig zu <br/>übervorteilen, sondern sich gegenseitig zu helfen und zu unterstützen.  <br/>Ohne Angst davor zu haben Konkurenten anzuwerben, bringen sie immer wieder <br/>neue Kids aus den Slums mit, um auch ihnen die Möglichkeit auf ein neues Leben zu eröffnen. <br/>Den Trainern ist es somit gelungen, den Kids aus den Slums von Chennai durch <br/>Ultimate eine Botschaft zu übermitteln, die ihr gesamtes Leben verändert. </p><p> <br/><strong>Welche konkrete Aktion plant Bessie´s Spirit zu unterstützen?</strong> <br/>Zur Zeit werden noch etwa 700USD (550€) benötigt, um drei jungen Erwachsenen aus den Slums die Möglichkeit zu geben an den World Championship of Beach Ultimate (WCBU) 2015 in Dubai (UAE) teilzunehmen.  <br/>Die Teilnahme an den WCBU würde für die Kids nicht nur in sportlicher Hinsicht eine Aufwertung bedeuten, sondern ihnen ebenfalls eine hohe gesellschaftliche <br/>Anerkennung bringen.  Die Spenden werden für die Deckung der Reisekosten, die Beschaffung der Reisepässe, sowie für Unterkunft und Verpflegung von Siva, Jagan und Ganesh in Dubai verwendet.</p><p>Bei Bessie´s Spirit und der Ultimate Community in Chennai steht der Mensch als Individuum im Mittelpunkt. Begriffe wie Inklusion und Integration werden hier nicht nur als Aushängeschilder genutzt, sondern finden ihren Raum in der praktischen Umsetzung im gemeinsamen Miteinander.  <br/>Die aus den Slums stammenden Kids sind integriert und respektiert, sie sind ein Teil der Community geworden.  <br/>Aus den Slumbewohnern Siva, Ganesh, Jagan, Sumesh und Arun, um nur einige von ihnen zu nennen, wurden unsere Freunde. Für ihr Team Fly!Wild jedoch wurden sie zu einer richtigen Familie. Sie zählen heute schon zu den besten Nachwuchsspielern Indiens und sind somit vom Bessie und aus der Chennai Ultimate Frisbee Community nicht mehr wegzudenken.  </p><p><span>Bei weiteren Fragen können Sie Sabine Trost, die das Projekt in Deutschland leitet, jederzeit über folgende E-Mail Adresse kontaktieren:</span></p><p><span><a href=""mailto:bessies_spirit@gmx.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bessies_spirit@gmx.de</a></span></p><p></p><p>Vielen Dank im Voraus für Ihre Unterstützung auch im Namen von Siva, Jagan und Ganesh (Foto v.r.)<br/></p></div>","Unter dem Projektnamen “Bessies´s Spirit” sollen Spenden für Kinder, Jugendliche und junge Erwachsene (im Folgenden als Kids bezeichnet) aus den Slums von Chennai gesammelt werden.

Das Ziel der Trainer für jedes ihrer Kids ist, dass sie einen Schulabschluss erhalten um anschließend die Möglichkeit zu haben, eine Ausbildung oder sogar ein Studium zu beginnen. Weitere Ziele sind, die Kids aus dem Sumpf von Drogen, Alkohol und Kriminalität herauszuholen, ihnen Disziplin, Respekt beizubringen und Englisch zu lernen.  Wie kann Ultimate das ermöglichen? Die Trainer der Kids sind nicht einfach nur ihre Trainer. Sie sind ihre Familie, sie unterstützen sie in allen Lebensbereichen, fördern sie und geben ihnen das Gefühl, dass sie einen Wert haben, obwohl sie aus den Slums stammen. Sie unterrichten die Kids in ihrer Freizeit und motivieren sie immer wieder, sich in ihrem Leben Ziele zu setzen – hohe Ziele.  Die Trainer, die selbst studiert haben oder “gute Berufe” (u.a. auch als Schauspieler) ausüben, nehmen alle Kids in ihren Teams auf. Unabhängig von Kaste (das indische Kastensystem existiert immer noch in den Köpfen vieler Menschen), Religion, Hautfarbe, Kultur, Nationalität und Geschlecht. Von Anfang an wurde Ultimate in Indien in der Mixed Division ausgetragen. Entgegen der gesamten Stellung der Frauen in Indien, wird das weibliche Geschlecht beim Ultimate gleichgestellt und respektiert. Die Kids selbst werden durch Ultimate selbstbewusster, lernen Verantwortung für ihr eigenes Leben zu übernehmen und ebenfalls auf andere zu achten. Trotz ihres täglichen Lebenskampfs in den Slums lernen sie, sich nicht mehr gegenseitig zu übervorteilen, sondern sich gegenseitig zu helfen und zu unterstützen.  Ohne Angst davor zu haben Konkurenten anzuwerben, bringen sie immer wieder neue Kids aus den Slums mit, um auch ihnen die Möglichkeit auf ein neues Leben zu eröffnen. Den Trainern ist es somit gelungen, den Kids aus den Slums von Chennai durch Ultimate eine Botschaft zu übermitteln, die ihr gesamtes Leben verändert.  Welche konkrete Aktion plant Bessie´s Spirit zu unterstützen? Zur Zeit werden noch etwa 700USD (550€) benötigt, um drei jungen Erwachsenen aus den Slums die Möglichkeit zu geben an den World Championship of Beach Ultimate (WCBU) 2015 in Dubai (UAE) teilzunehmen.  Die Teilnahme an den WCBU würde für die Kids nicht nur in sportlicher Hinsicht eine Aufwertung bedeuten, sondern ihnen ebenfalls eine hohe gesellschaftliche Anerkennung bringen.  Die Spenden werden für die Deckung der Reisekosten, die Beschaffung der Reisepässe, sowie für Unterkunft und Verpflegung von Siva, Jagan und Ganesh in Dubai verwendet.Bei Bessie´s Spirit und der Ultimate Community in Chennai steht der Mensch als Individuum im Mittelpunkt. Begriffe wie Inklusion und Integration werden hier nicht nur als Aushängeschilder genutzt, sondern finden ihren Raum in der praktischen Umsetzung im gemeinsamen Miteinander.  Die aus den Slums stammenden Kids sind integriert und respektiert, sie sind ein Teil der Community geworden.  Aus den Slumbewohnern Siva, Ganesh, Jagan, Sumesh und Arun, um nur einige von ihnen zu nennen, wurden unsere Freunde. Für ihr Team Fly!Wild jedoch wurden sie zu einer richtigen Familie. Sie zählen heute schon zu den besten Nachwuchsspielern Indiens und sind somit vom Bessie und aus der Chennai Ultimate Frisbee Community nicht mehr wegzudenken.  Bei weiteren Fragen können Sie Sabine Trost, die das Projekt in Deutschland leitet, jederzeit über folgende E-Mail Adresse kontaktieren:bessies_spirit@gmx.deVielen Dank im Voraus für Ihre Unterstützung auch im Namen von Siva, Jagan und Ganesh (Foto v.r.)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>about pvc</strong></h2>
<p>Each year thousands yoga mats are sold in the U.S. and almost all yoga mats are made from PVC. The main ingredient in PVC is vinyl chloride, which is a known human carcinogen. PVC can contain chemicals like phthalates and is toxic during every stage of its life cycle.</p>
<p>It is toxic during its manufacture; it is toxic to the end consumers; and it is toxic during its disposal. As consumers, we are exposed to PVC, through inhalation and skin contact. “Irina Webb from ireadlabelsforyou.com states, “If you are not careful you may expose yourself to toxic chemicals in your yoga mat. You may end up inhaling potentially harmful chemicals and absorb them through your skin.”</p>
<p>PVC (polyvinyl chloride) can contain chemicals like phthalates, which are linked to reproductive issues including shorter pregnancy duration and premature breast development in girls, and they can leach out over time, especially in warmer temperatures like those found in many hot yoga studios. Phthalate particles then cling to dust, which can be inhaled.<br/><br/>Also, dioxins are byproducts of PVC yoga mats’ manufacturing and disposal. Dioxins are a group of toxic chemicals that share a similar chemical structure and induce harm through a similar mechanism. They have been classified as a human carcinogen. They are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s list of priority pollutants. In addition, they are persistent (meaning, they do not break down easily in the environment) and bio-accumulative (meaning they build up in our bodies).”<br/> <br/><strong>Is your yoga mat free of PVC?</strong><br/>Manufacturers caught on to the idea that consumers are concerned about exposure to toxic chemicals. So they get very crafty with their product descriptions. With PVC yoga mats, you might read that they are free of toxic phthalates, lead, BPA, etc., which does not mean that that the yoga mat is free of PVC. Always ask the manufacturer by email whether the yoga mat you are looking to buy is free of PVC.</p>

No toxic PVC. No stink or greasy feel.But soft, durable, substantial, budge-proof, natural and breathable...like your favorite pair of jeans. You desire protection, confidence and stability— to take your practice to the next level.Yoga practice is supposed to bring balance to your health, mind and body. So why are most yoga mats made with toxic chemicals like PVC? Truth is, these man-made substances can harm your health and the environment. We felt it was time for a change. Introducing the PRITI MAT 1.0.  we are the priti collection.Over the past 3 years, we have successfully launched an eclectic array of necessary, modular products that enhance one’s yoga and meditation practice while supporting cotton growers, artisans and communities. We passionately believe that yoga goods can be as enlightened as those who practice yoga strive to be themselves.Our first product was our handwoven yoga blanket. This was our first quest: to explore precious Indian cotton, traditional weaving techniques and the best thickness and weight to assist when practicing yoga. Then we added color-coded folding lines and educated practitioners on how our blankets make a versatile prop— a tool to protect your body.  our storyI'm Joanna Feldheim, Founder|Creator of The Priti Collection. One day during yoga class, I thought, “Why am I practicing on a fake, potentially harmful PVC MAT?!” I couldn’t figure out their relationship to the yoga experience.As a creative director and product developer, it’s my job to solve problems by making sound products that are relevant, functional and aesthetic. I saw the PVC yoga mat as a problem and decided to do something about it. I created Priti with one simple mission: to bring quality, accessibility, beauty and sustainability to our yoga props and beyond.                                                      We spent one year developing, testing and perfecting our yoga mat. We created a small sampling and are asking beginners and seasoned teachers for input. Given the steep competition out there, expectations were very high. So far we have received rave reviews!  introducing priti mat | 1.0a natural yoga mat made from sustainably harvested tree rubber.Our goal was to create the best quality mat that is natural, non-harmful and free from PVC, TPE and OEKO-TEX. And unlike other rubber mats, the foaming agents used to create this mat are non-toxic. Our PRITI MAT/1.0 combines comfort and performance— It’s soft yet solid, non-slip and budge-proof with just the right substance, weight and padding for your body. It is thick, eco-sustainable and reversible. It's not smelly, flaky or sticky. We know you want to feel protected, confident and stable— to go to the next level. And— we also know you are a sucker for aesthetics.    
why are we raising money?After designing our mat, we convinced our one-of-a-kind, needle-in-a-PVC-stack manufacturer to produce a limited sampling for testing. Once we compiled data and qualitative, we were convinced we pinned the tail on the donkey.Thanks to you, we have successfully reached our initial funding goal! This allows us to place our first minimum quantity mat order and send them to you asap! stretch goalsWe are excited to stretch our body and mat offerings.We'd like to keep our Priti Mat Line growing healthy— developing enough product and a variety of offerings. Since we met our initial goal, we'd like to show you our plans to grow:— Raise the quantity of our first order: need $12,500 total— Introduce second new color and order minimum quantity: need $20,000 total— Add a third new color and order minimum quantity:  need $27,500 total— To develop proprietary mat accessories: need $32,500 total— To develop a thin, travel mat, first color, minimum run: need $40,000 totalThese stretch goals require capital to expand with R&D, production and marketing our expanded line.  two sides to every story.Our Priti Mat is reversible! Two distinct practice surfaces allow you the freedom to change things up depending on your style of yoga. The mesh side is designed with a soft texture and the matte side has a super smooth texture. a) woven side: b) matte side:  testimonials                                      ""She Arrived...”“She arrived in the mail today & I am totally in #love.” #thisismyyoga #embodiedliving— Erin Labadie on Apr 25, 2017Erin Labadie is a E-RYT 200/RYT500/RPYT/YACEP Yoga Teacher with a focus in Restorative, Flow & Restore﻿, Meditation, and Mentorship. “Beautiful product!” “I had to write to tell you how IN LOVE i am with my new yoga mat! Actually, I thought I was ordering a smaller (thinner etc.) “travel mat.” I was surprised when I received it how much larger it was. However, It is gorgeous & I love the color & mat texture. Great job on the design. I may have to order a second 1 for my home. :) Just wanted to give the feedback. Once again, a beautiful product! It will surely inspire my practice. Thank you again!

She is also a therapist in private practice as well as an educator in Mindfulness for UCLA and Compassion Cultivation Training for Stanford. “Unique/Priceless/Cherished” “Finally, found it! After more than 25 years of yoga practice this is the only mat you will ever need. Perfect for my Yin practice and all my standing postures. It's also so beautiful I can leave it in the middle of my living room all day!” — Jacquie Ruderman on Jan 14, 2017Jacquie Ruderman is an E-RYT 500HR certified yoga instructor (yin, restorative and vinyasa flow.) “Pretty Priti.”“I must admit...I am a sucker for aesthetics. I bought this mat because it is beautiful to look at (though I did know that it was tried and tested successfully for function.) Like a favorite piece of clothing, this mat just feels right. Each side has its own texture. I find that I am using the heathered cloth like side for seated asanas/ meditation/ study and flip it over for extra traction for my more ""grittier"" type practice. It's kind of like a yin/yang mat or two mats in one. The Priti mat is both pretty and and practical.” — Laurie Fusco on Jan 14, 2017Laurie Fusco is a YTT 500 Certified Yoga Teacher“ Finally have a mat that I can relate to.” “Finally have a mat that I can relate to: firm enough to feel the energy rebound as well as the ability to melt into it. The Priti Mat is double sided; the weightier side doesn't slide...it supports as well as repels perspiration. And it's not smelly or sticky. If u care about your practice, care about your props, a creative leap ahead of the ordinary.” — Christopher Ray Mankowski on Dec 30, 2016Christopher Ray Mankowski ​ is a E-RYT 500 Certified Yoga Teacher what our mentors are saying:Bobbi Brown: Elena Brower: Amanda Harding

about pvc
Each year thousands yoga mats are sold in the U.S. and almost all yoga mats are made from PVC. The main ingredient in PVC is vinyl chloride, which is a known human carcinogen. PVC can contain chemicals like phthalates and is toxic during every stage of its life cycle.
It is toxic during its manufacture; it is toxic to the end consumers; and it is toxic during its disposal. As consumers, we are exposed to PVC, through inhalation and skin contact. “Irina Webb from ireadlabelsforyou.com states, “If you are not careful you may expose yourself to toxic chemicals in your yoga mat. You may end up inhaling potentially harmful chemicals and absorb them through your skin.”
PVC (polyvinyl chloride) can contain chemicals like phthalates, which are linked to reproductive issues including shorter pregnancy duration and premature breast development in girls, and they can leach out over time, especially in warmer temperatures like those found in many hot yoga studios. Phthalate particles then cling to dust, which can be inhaled.Also, dioxins are byproducts of PVC yoga mats’ manufacturing and disposal. Dioxins are a group of toxic chemicals that share a similar chemical structure and induce harm through a similar mechanism. They have been classified as a human carcinogen. They are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s list of priority pollutants. In addition, they are persistent (meaning, they do not break down easily in the environment) and bio-accumulative (meaning they build up in our bodies).” Is your yoga mat free of PVC?Manufacturers caught on to the idea that consumers are concerned about exposure to toxic chemicals. So they get very crafty with their product descriptions. With PVC yoga mats, you might read that they are free of toxic phthalates, lead, BPA, etc., which does not mean that that the yoga mat is free of PVC. Always ask the manufacturer by email whether the yoga mat you are looking to buy is free of PVC.

Sensor Ball

Measures Initial Direction - What you see is not always what you get. Now you will know if your initial direction is truly on-line and square to target. You will know EXACTLY how far off-line or on-line your ball rolls after impact. Initial direction is 90% of your putting, so knowing this is the key to getting a beautiful and buttery stroke.

Measures Speed - Speed can kill a perfectly lined putt. By knowing your Speed Limit, you can control your power and gain consistency with every putt.

Measures Impact Force - Strong out of the gate wins the race. Rolling the ball ""end over end"" with perfect force will determine if you sink your ball. Avoid ""back spinning"" and ""skipping"" by mastering your force.

Measures Ball Rotation - From 0 to 60, a lot can happen. Eliminate the guesswork and master your distance, for the very first time, know the EXACT RPM your ball travels to every hole.  



 
 
Putter Sensor



Face Angle – Face the facts. 95% of initial direction is face angle. If your face isn’t close to square, then chances are you’re not on-line. Achieve perfect initial direction by keeping your face angle square.

Tempo – Timing is key. The best putters in the world have a 2:1 ratio of Back:Forward stroke. See your tempo with every putt and improve your stroke. Refine your back stroke and forward stroke with your tempo. 


Back Stroke – We’ve got your back. Knowing your Back Stroke time will keep you consistent. A good Back Stroke makes for a great Forward Stroke.

Forward Stroke – Move your game forward. Preventing deceleration and acceleration on a Forward Stroke will give you consistent ball speed.
