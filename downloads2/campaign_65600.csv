<p>Trying to get your child into STEM? Looking for a more hands-on approach to education? STEMtrunk is a subscription lending library for the best K-8th grade STEM (Science / Technology / Engineering / Math) toys in the world. So what does that mean? Simple - instead of paying hundreds of dollars to try out a new educational product - you get access to DOZENS of products delivered right to your door for one low monthly fee.</p>

<p>STEMtrunk works by giving you new toy credits to your account each month. These credits never expire as long as you have an account! Each educational product has a credit cost based on how expensive the item would be to purchase directly. Save up credits for larger items!</p>

<p><strong><i>A note from our CEO - Aaron Watkins</i></strong></p>
<p><i>Hi Potential Backers!</i></p>
<p><i>As a parent of two smart and talented children (Ethan - 15 and Kelsey -9), I have spent years facing the same struggles other parents in our tech savvy world today face. I knew that STEM skills were important for my children, and I wanted to prepare them for a world that was rapidly changing.  Their version of ""technology"" though often meant sitting in front of a screen checking out the latest app or zoning out to a YouTube video. While I believe there is a place for the screen - I wanted my children's play to be both hands-on and educational.</i></p>
<p><i>Looking around - I found SO MUCH cool stuff that satisfied this desire. Robotics kits! Build-your-own-computer! Drones that would teach you how to program! Everywhere I looked, something new was popping up. The speed of innovation in children's educational products matches the rapid speed of technology changes in other areas of our life. But how was I to know which were high quality? Without trying it out, could I be sure that my child would enjoy any particular item? And the COST! I started sweating every time I went looking for a price tag. </i></p>
<p><i>Why do we at STEMtrunk promote STEM education? Because we believe that STEM now = Jobs tomorrow. We face a changing world, one in which STEM skills are going to be fundamental for the majority of tomorrows workforce. Even now, we face a shortage of workers qualified to fill the demand for high paying jobs in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. It is our goal to help prepare more of our children to succeed in these areas in the future.</i></p>
<p><i>STEMtrunk is our solution to exposing more children to a wide variety of STEM educational options while not breaking the bank for parents. We hope you join us on our journey. I'll leave you with one of my favorite quotes from the amazing Bill Nye:</i></p>

<p>STEMtrunk's are great for classrooms as well as families!

<p><strong>What happens if something breaks or is lost?</strong> This is our most common question, and at STEMtrunk we feel that parents shouldn't have to worry about something breaking. If small parts end up getting lost, you will not be charged for those, we keep plenty of spare parts lying around. If a product breaks, simple send it back and we will send you a new version of the product. If a product is lost completely and you are unable to return it, we have to charge you the MSRP of the product.</p>
<p><strong>Do I pay for shipping?</strong> Your first shipment from STEMtrunk is free, and future shipments cost $10 per shipment. This is less than we pay to ship your product since we have to cover shipping it to you, and shipping it back to us, but it also keeps us from having to raise the monthly fee. Your $10 covers both the cost of shipping your item to you, and returning the item to us. (A return label is included in your trunk).</p>
<p><strong>What if I want to keep the item?</strong> We are working on a system that will allow you to purchase the item if you wish to keep it and automatically be moved onto your next item. This will not be ready at launch however.</p>
<p><strong>Is this available outside the United States?</strong> Not at the time, but it's in the plans!</p>
<p><strong>What are credits? </strong>When you sign up for STEMtrunk you will get credits added to your account each month. If you do not use them right away, they accrue in your account. When you want to choose a new toy, you must have enough credits in your account to cover that product. Most products are 2-3 credits. </p>
<p><strong>What is the age range of products? </strong>Every parent knows their child best and what will work for them. We list on the website the manufacture recommended age ranges from kindergarten to 8th grade. </p>
<p><strong>Can I send this as a gift to someone else? </strong>Absolutely! Just designate their address as the shipping location. Please note that your card will be on file for shipping. </p>
<p><strong>Are the toys clean?</strong> Absolutely! Every product is sanitized prior to shipment.</p>
<p><strong>Are you homeschool approved? </strong>Unlike other toy rental companies, STEMtrunk is 100% educational, making it easy to get funding approval for homeschoolers. In fact, we are already approved with a number of homeschool programs. If you would like us to get approval at your homeschool program, please <a href=""mailto:aaron@stemtrunk.com?subject=Homeschool%20Approvals"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact us</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to my credits if I cancel?</strong> If you cancel your subscription, and credits you have in your account will be put on hold. If you ever come back and sign up again, your credits will be made available to you again!</p>
<p><strong>When will my STEMtrunk ship?</strong> Supporters who back STEMtrunk first will also get their shipments first, with an expected delivery date of May 2018. We will roll out additional shipments soon after.  If you have a specific date which you want to have shipping start, we are  offering a ""delay my shipment"" for families who may not want to start their shipments until later. School shipments are expected to begin in August / September for the 2018-2019 school year. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">But how do I get shade on my table?</h2>
<p>This is another question we get asked a lot!  <strong>Fact:</strong> Since the sun moves, so does the shade, being able to move Rail-EZ gives you a big advantage! Sometimes 10 feet behind you is the best place to put your umbrella to get maximum shade, as you see in the video above. BONUS is you don't have a big pole between you and your dinner companion :)  </p>

No surprise... we get asked that all the time!
We have tested the Rail-EZ to the breaking point at which time the Rail-EZ's Patent-pending design is made to release before it will damage your railing. 
That being said, you should not leave your patio umbrella up in high winds with traditional patio umbrella stands and we suggest the same with the Rail-EZ. 


In cases of a less sturdy railing, or if a sudden gust of wind is a concern, or if you just need extra strength for a heavier umbrella or other items like a clothes hanger, we suggest that you USE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE UMBRELLA POLE (both sections).This way you extend the pole through the Rail-EZ holder straight down to the patio floor at the base of the railing. By doing this you transfer all the weight and wind forces from the umbrella to the patio floor and there will be little to no twist or torsion on the railing itself.BONUS the fixed parallelogram that the umbrella post and your railing create when held together by the Rail-EZ will actually strengthen a wobbly railing! Folks ask us all the time...How can that work? Only half the umbrella is on the deck.FACT: The sun is only ever overhead part of the day, it changes position depending on the time of day. Your umbrella may only be over 1/2 the deck in the straight position but using an umbrella that tilts and being able to move the Rail-EZ as the sun moves makes it extremely effective in targeting exactly where you want shade! Works great on most picnic tables too!Works great on fences, TOO!!

 

But how do I get shade on my table?
This is another question we get asked a lot!  Fact: Since the sun moves, so does the shade, being able to move Rail-EZ gives you a big advantage! Sometimes 10 feet behind you is the best place to put your umbrella to get maximum shade, as you see in the video above. BONUS is you don't have a big pole between you and your dinner companion :)  



We live in Vancouver Canada, we can't let the rain stop our barbeque time! 

 
Not sure if it will fit your railing size or type?Send us a photo with clear measurements and we can let you know for sure!  Just email to andrew@rail-ez.com and we will get back to you as soon as possible!Here we are testing the Rail-EZ with a 45-pound kettlebell!We've tested the Rail-EZ to the breaking point...At which time the Rail-EZ releases before it can damage your railing. In addition, most umbrellas will collapse before it's able to put the kind of momentum or torque it would take to break your railing!That being said, you should not leave your patio umbrella up in high winds with traditional patio umbrella stands, and we suggest the same with the Rail-EZ.Bit of a nerdy fact: OSHA Safety requirements state that a railing must be able to withstand at least 200 pounds of force applied in a downward or outward direction within 2 inches of the top edge at any point along the top railing, the moral of the story is a standard railing built to spec can take a LOT of pressure!  We know some backyard railings may not meet OSHA standards, that is why we suggest the option of using it in the ""extended"" configuration, however, any DIY railing products that you buy from mass hardware stores would meet OSHA standards. We have lined the Rail-EZ with UHMW Pads (a soft and slippery kind of plastic) this protects your railing and prevents it from denting or scratching. We did tests on the amount of force and a traditional umbrella stand can take vs. the Rail-EZ. It took about 7.5 pounds of pressure before a 50-pound stand tipped over. The same umbrella in the Rail-EZ took about 23 pounds of pressure before it caused the Rail-EZ to break loose from the railing.The Rail-EZ can withstand about 3x as much wind force of a traditional umbrella stand.Keep in mind, whether you put your umbrella in a traditional heavy weighted umbrella stand, or in the Rail-EZ, the amount of wind the actual umbrella itself can take will not change. Our homes are the center of our world.Now More than ever we need to make the most out of our personal outdoor spaces, and that’s what Rail-EZ was designed to do!Times may be unsure ...but one thing we ARE sure of... summer is coming! ? And our goal is to help you create an outdoor haven on your patio, deck or balcony. We know it's important to have a place where you can go to get fresh air, be comfortable and be protected from the sun.That's why we felt compelled to launch our Kickstarter project, because we know people are going to need Rail-EZ in the coming months. Here are some ideas we've come up with! Complete design specs and how-to videos will be available on our website after the campaign is over.  You can also join our Facebook Group where we plan to take requests and test...""Will it mount""?For now... here is a bit of Inspiration!A TV!!!... or a Privacy Blind...A Small or Medium-Sized Table...A Bar-length Table!

<h3>Why do you need a smart garage door opener(GDO)?</h3>
<p>You've probably been through one of these situations:</p>
<p>1. Forgot your remote key or put them in your bag in the car trunk?</p>
<p>2. Left home or fell asleep with the garage door opened?</p>
<p>3. When a delivery person arrives, nobody is at home?</p>
<p>4. Go out for a run or a walk but forget to bring your keys?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You may have already tried other smart garage door openers but faced below issues:<br/><br/>1. Sensor detection is not stable. You will sometimes find garage door open, but App tells you the door is closed.</p>
<p>2. Setup is a big hassle or even seems mission impossible.</p>
<p>3. Provided wireless sensor needs battery replacement frequently. Or provided wire is not long enough.</p>

</div></div>","Why do you need a smart garage door opener(GDO)?
You've probably been through one of these situations:
1. Forgot your remote key or put them in your bag in the car trunk?
2. Left home or fell asleep with the garage door opened?
3. When a delivery person arrives, nobody is at home?
4. Go out for a run or a walk but forget to bring your keys?
 
You may have already tried other smart garage door openers but faced below issues:1. Sensor detection is not stable. You will sometimes find garage door open, but App tells you the door is closed.
2. Setup is a big hassle or even seems mission impossible.
3. Provided wireless sensor needs battery replacement frequently. Or provided wire is not long enough.
4. User guide is too complicated.

</ul><h1> </h1><h1><b>Our Patent-Pending Technology</b></h1><p>Knocki's performance is made possible by our suite of patent-pending technology and sophisticated software &amp; hardware algorithms:</p><ul>

<li>Knocki uses non-acoustic sensor technology that is NOT triggered by or affected by sound. Thus, multiple Knockis can coexist in the same room without conflict (as long as they are on separate surfaces).  For example, you can setup one Knocki behind your nightstand, and another behind the nightstand of your partner! </li>

Services like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa can simplify tasks, but often don’t work as expected.</p><p>Here are a few of the problems:</p><ul>
<li>
<b>Background sounds:</b>  Music or a TV playing in the background can render voice-control useless. Knocki uses non-acoustic sensors so it works just as well if you’re jamming to music, watching the evening news, or if people are talking in the background.</li>
<li>
<b>Can Disturb Others: </b> Voice control is problematic in quiet environments such as a shared office or in bedrooms where you don’t want to disturb others. Knocki’s advanced accelerometer technology responds to gentle taps that others won’t hear.</li>
<li>
<b>It Often Misunderstands:</b> Did you say “where is rome” or “navigate home?” Voice technology is finicky, especially with kids, elderly, and people with accents who might not enunciate in the required way. Knocki uses simple tap/knock gestures, and our patent-pending technology to perform reliably whether you tap fast, slow, hard, or soft.</li>
<li>
<b>Can’t use multiple voice controllers in the same space:</b> Good luck putting a voice controller on your nightstand, and then another one on your partner’s nightstand. You’ll have both controllers responding simultaneously creating smart home chaos. Knocki recognizes gestures on a specific surface so you can have multiple Knockis in the same room or other space without conflict. Knocki allows you to personalize controls to the surfaces near you.</li>

<li>
<b>Don’t blend in: </b> Wall switches and buttons aren’t so pretty to look at. Knocki can be placed under or behind surfaces, so you don’t even have to see it to use it. But if you do mount it within view, it blends beautifully with your surfaces.</li>
<li>
<b>Must be pressed or flipped: </b>Physical buttons and switches must be within physical reach in order to be used. Knocki turns an entire surface into a remote control, so you can trigger actions from anywhere, without needing to visually or physically locate a specific spot. (Also great for kids, physically impaired, and elderly who can’t reach a switch).</li>
<li>
<b>Not as reliable or responsive: </b>Most buttons rely on Bluetooth, so they require a phone to be turned on, paired to the button, and within range in order to function. Unlike smart buttons, Knocki uses WiFi to trigger actions directly, without going through a phone. This allows Knocki to work instantly without the lag of bluetooth, and even if your phone is off.</li>
<li>
<b>Limited functionality: </b> Many smart switches/buttons only perform a single on/off function, or are limited to only a few press patterns. Knocki can provide quick and easy control of a few functions for most users, but power users can go wild with up to 10 gestures per Knocki-enabled surface, allowing their entire tables, walls, furniture and other surfaces to control thousands of devices via IFTTT, SmartThings, Wemo, and more!</li>

An endless maze of mobile apps, smart switches, and other interfaces create a confusing and fragmented experience.We believe there's a better way - Knocki offers the simplest, most natural, and accessible way to control the world around you.  You've never seen anything like it!The Buzz Meet KnockiKnocki is a small wireless device that instantly transforms ordinary surfaces (walls, tables, doors, furniture, countertops, & more) into powerful yet easy to access remotes for your favorite devices and software.The BasicsUsing Knocki is easy.  Just tap simple gestures anywhere on a Knocki-enabled surface to automate all kinds of useful actions.  Make your ordinary surroundings do more.Why reach for a phone, a remote, or a switch to perform your favorite functions? There's another control interface that's always within reach - the world around you, and you can activate it with Knocki. Can your table turn on a TV or dim the lights?  With Knocki discreetly mounted underneath, the entire surface becomes capable and connected.  Knocki adds magical simplicity wherever you use it. A Few of the Many Use Cases  Who is Knocki for?Knocki isn't just for people with smart homes or high-tech offices.  Knocki works well anywhere with a WiFi internet connection.  It allows you to ""tap"" into many powerful functions, even if your only smart device is an iPhone or Android phone.Knocki is the easiest way to add ""smarts"" to your existing home, without the wiring, installation, complexity and expense of many alternative smart home control systems. But if you already have a few smart devices, you can immediately expand what Knocki can do, and transform ""dumb"" surfaces all around your home or office into intelligent interfaces.Bottom line, if you'd like technology to work for you, instead of the other way around, you'll appreciate the power of Knocki! You can put Knocki on, under, or behind surfaces anywhere!Attach Knocki on walls, under tables, behind shelves or nightstands, behind your front door, and more!  Knocki can be placed in plain sight, or mounted invisibly under or behind surfaces so only you know its there.Each Knocki includes a special mount featuring our patent-pending SurfaceLink™ technology to ensure a solid connection to a surface for transmission of gesture signals.  Knocki's mount can be secured using the included 3M removable tape, or with screws (also included). Setup is Easy!Setting up your Knocki is easy and just takes a few minutes. Start by connecting Knocki to your WiFi network and use the free Knocki companion app to link all your devices and accounts. After Knocki is mounted to a surface,  define the unique gestures to trigger your actions (up to 10 gestures), and you've instantly created a powerful smart surface!  The process is simple, and once it's done, Knocki will keep working (via WiFi) even if your phone is turned off or away!With Knocki installed on a surface, the surface instantly becomes a powerful and programmable remote control, even many feet away from where Knocki is attached.Knocki uses non-acoustic sensor technology to detect gentle surface gestures even a distance away, but Knocki also has the intelligence to filter out random vibrations.  Therefore, Knocki works under busy breakfast tables and other ""high-activity"" surfaces.Gently Tap or KnockKnocki reliably identifies simple gestures defined by taps or knocks on a surface. Gestures can be defined by a quantity (two, three, four, or more taps), or even by more complex patterns (two taps + three taps) for more secure functions.For example, a double tap can be set to turn on a light, and a more elaborate sequence (two triple taps followed by a double tap) can be used to unlock a smart lock.
One Knocki can store up to 10 unique gestures, turning any surface into a remote control with many functions.  
A gesture can trigger a single action (e.g. ""find phone""), or a set of actions (e.g. ""door locked"" + ""lights off"" + ""home security armed"").
 Our Patent-Pending TechnologyKnocki's performance is made possible by our suite of patent-pending technology and sophisticated software & hardware algorithms:
Knocki deciphers deliberate taps and knocks from random vibrations in the environment to minimize false positives. 
Knocki uses non-acoustic sensor technology that is NOT triggered by or affected by sound. Thus, multiple Knockis can coexist in the same room without conflict (as long as they are on separate surfaces).  For example, you can setup one Knocki behind your nightstand, and another behind the nightstand of your partner! 
Advanced power-budgeting delivers over 12 months of battery life using AAA batteries. (Please always use mercury free batteries, or better yet, rechargeable batteries!  We like this planet). 
Some of the Platforms Knocki Supports:We're constantly adding integrations with new smart home platforms, devices, and software. Our commitment is to make Knocki more capable over time, and connected to the leading technology of tomorrow.Knocki's capabilities will continue to expand as we add new partners, update the mobile app, and even push out OTA hardware updates.
Recently added integrations and functionality:



HTTP Requests: Knocki is already designed to provide incredible capability through cloud integration with many platforms.  By unlocking HTTP Requests, Knocki can do even more.  Some smart home platforms provide direct API access only through LAN. Furthermore, local IP communication between Knocki and other devices allows it work even when your internet connection is down!

SONOS: This was our #1 request.  After all, who doesn't love SONOS? In a similar fashion to Knocki, SONOS makes your environment simpler and more enjoyable.

Gesture Copy & Paste: This feature makes it easy to quickly duplicate your favorite gesture settings between Knockis. 
What About Voice Control?Voice control is everywhere. Services like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa can simplify tasks, but often don’t work as expected.Here are a few of the problems:

Background sounds:  Music or a TV playing in the background can render voice-control useless. Knocki uses non-acoustic sensors so it works just as well if you’re jamming to music, watching the evening news, or if people are talking in the background.

Can Disturb Others:  Voice control is problematic in quiet environments such as a shared office or in bedrooms where you don’t want to disturb others. Knocki’s advanced accelerometer technology responds to gentle taps that others won’t hear.

It Often Misunderstands: Did you say “where is rome” or “navigate home?” Voice technology is finicky, especially with kids, elderly, and people with accents who might not enunciate in the required way. Knocki uses simple tap/knock gestures, and our patent-pending technology to perform reliably whether you tap fast, slow, hard, or soft.

Can’t use multiple voice controllers in the same space: Good luck putting a voice controller on your nightstand, and then another one on your partner’s nightstand. You’ll have both controllers responding simultaneously creating smart home chaos. Knocki recognizes gestures on a specific surface so you can have multiple Knockis in the same room or other space without conflict. Knocki allows you to personalize controls to the surfaces near you.
 What about Smart Switches and Buttons?Smart buttons and switches can also automate tasks, but they have a few “pressing” problems.

Don’t blend in:  Wall switches and buttons aren’t so pretty to look at. Knocki can be placed under or behind surfaces, so you don’t even have to see it to use it. But if you do mount it within view, it blends beautifully with your surfaces.

Must be pressed or flipped: Physical buttons and switches must be within physical reach in order to be used. Knocki turns an entire surface into a remote control, so you can trigger actions from anywhere, without needing to visually or physically locate a specific spot. (Also great for kids, physically impaired, and elderly who can’t reach a switch).

Not as reliable or responsive: Most buttons rely on Bluetooth, so they require a phone to be turned on, paired to the button, and within range in order to function. Unlike smart buttons, Knocki uses WiFi to trigger actions directly, without going through a phone. This allows Knocki to work instantly without the lag of bluetooth, and even if your phone is off.

Limited functionality:  Many smart switches/buttons only perform a single on/off function, or are limited to only a few press patterns. Knocki can provide quick and easy control of a few functions for most users, but power users can go wild with up to 10 gestures per Knocki-enabled surface, allowing their entire tables, walls, furniture and other surfaces to control thousands of devices via IFTTT, SmartThings, Wemo, and more!
Beautiful Inside & OutHere's what you get with each unit ordered: 

Knocki: Made in the USA.

Surface Mount: Featuring our SurfaceLink™ technology, the mount helps transfer gesture signals from the surface to Knocki.

3M Tape: Working directly with 3M, we've customized and tested a secure yet removable adhesive to avoid damaging surfaces.

AAA Duracell Batteries: Mercury-free Duracell alkaline batteries provide over 12 months of battery life.

Our Free Companion App (iOS & Android): Only necessary for device setup. The app allows you to easily connect Knocki to your WiFi and quickly add up to 10 gestures per Knocki device. You can manage multiple Knockis from one account.  The app also allows you to monitor battery life, connectivity status, and view activity logs.

</h3><br/><p>A couple of years ago, I was going to dive the cenotes in Riviera Maya and needed a compact and fully functional housing in order to take my DSLR Underwater. I have been designing hard shell, aluminum housing for still and video cameras with local companies for many years and always needed to bring the unit as transport friendly as possible.</p><p>This is where the fun begins. Based on my experience with clear and flexible TPU and hard shell housings, I then tried to combine both to make the most compact yet versatile housing ever. The 1st prototype came along with a double o-ring sealed solid framing to which the flexible material was welded in order to create what is now the BoxJellyCase. </p><p>I then took it down to my cenotes dives and got really impressed with the ease of use of the prototype.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">With some of my friends help we were able to build a couple more units that we used through different conditions to validate the performance of the product.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Since then we have been doing </span>craft work in order to build custom units for specific needs. Now, with the new designs we are ready to launch the production of the whole line of Box JellyCase for Compact, Medium and Pro DSLRs. For us to achieve our goal, we need you guys to help us acquire plastic molds, dies and jigs for mass production. With all the tests we ran through we know that your investment is going to be worth every penny. </p><p><a href=""http://youtu.be/Bzqb-6ZGLgg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/Bzqb-6ZGLgg</a><br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FBzqb-6ZGLgg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DBzqb-6ZGLgg&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FBzqb-6ZGLgg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Advantages:</b></p><p>- Lightweight (quite a lot compared to hard shell housings)</p><p>- Compact (quite a lot compared to hard shell housings)</p><p>- Access to all functions</p><p>- Clear material for complete see through</p><p>- Modular (Build your setup with multiple lenses and accessories)</p><p>- Usable underwater up to 30 feet (9 meters)</p><p>- Tough and highly puncture resistant material</p><p>- Structural o-ring sealed main frames</p><p>- Double latched main frames</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Limitations:</b></p><p>- Underwater, passed 30 feet, the flexible material starts to press on the buttons what makes the camera to freeze.

camera protected?</b></p>
<p>Your camera
is protected by a combination of hard material frames and soft films pockets
that are securely welded together for a maximum tear resistance. The flexible
pockets are made of strong, clear and flexible TPU films that are permanently
attached to the frames. These frames are acting as the entry for the camera.
They seal with a silicone o-ring and are securely closed with two locking
latches.</p>
<p><b>What is the
maximum depth I can go to?</b></p>
<p>The Box
JellyCase is depth rated to 30 feet (9m). Depending on the camera setup you may
experience some difficulties due to the pressure by the film on the camera
buttons, some functions may be activated by accident. Re-aligning the camera in
the BJC will normally solve the problem.</p>
<p><b>What are
the care instructions for my product?</b></p>
<p>As any type
of underwater casing, you will need to rinse your system with clear water in
order to remove sea salt, dust and dirt from your BJC. Lubricating the o-ring every
second use or after a long period of storage is also a good habit so they can
hold their sealing properties for a longer period. Do not leave your BJC under
direct sunlight for a long period of time, this may damage your product.</p>
<p><b>What type
of warranty do I get with my Box JellyCase ?</b></p>
<p>Tribor Design is warrant of its
entire product and/or part of it as long as the demand is made from the
original purchaser. Box JellyCase, at its own discretion, will fix the
defective unit with original parts or replace it with an identical unit. In the
case that the product is discontinued, the defective unit will be replaced with
a product of the same value.</p>
<p>This warranty excludes
all requests for indirect losses, consecutive damage and do not apply to
accidental damages, to an abusive usage of the product, to a misusage of the
product as well as all voluntary alteration of the product.</p>
<p>We recommend the user
to have an insurance to protect the photographic material in case of accident.</p>

A couple of years ago, I was going to dive the cenotes in Riviera Maya and needed a compact and fully functional housing in order to take my DSLR Underwater. I have been designing hard shell, aluminum housing for still and video cameras with local companies for many years and always needed to bring the unit as transport friendly as possible.This is where the fun begins. Based on my experience with clear and flexible TPU and hard shell housings, I then tried to combine both to make the most compact yet versatile housing ever. The 1st prototype came along with a double o-ring sealed solid framing to which the flexible material was welded in order to create what is now the BoxJellyCase. I then took it down to my cenotes dives and got really impressed with the ease of use of the prototype.With some of my friends help we were able to build a couple more units that we used through different conditions to validate the performance of the product.Since then we have been doing craft work in order to build custom units for specific needs. Now, with the new designs we are ready to launch the production of the whole line of Box JellyCase for Compact, Medium and Pro DSLRs. For us to achieve our goal, we need you guys to help us acquire plastic molds, dies and jigs for mass production. With all the tests we ran through we know that your investment is going to be worth every penny. http://youtu.be/Bzqb-6ZGLggAdvantages:- Lightweight (quite a lot compared to hard shell housings)- Compact (quite a lot compared to hard shell housings)- Access to all functions- Clear material for complete see through- Modular (Build your setup with multiple lenses and accessories)- Usable underwater up to 30 feet (9 meters)- Tough and highly puncture resistant material- Structural o-ring sealed main frames- Double latched main framesLimitations:- Underwater, passed 30 feet, the flexible material starts to press on the buttons what makes the camera to freeze. (Leaving air inside the BJC and adding weight to the system will help reach greater depths)What We Need Mass production comes with a whole array of setups and equipment. This is where you could make a difference. In order to reach our goal we precisely need:- Plastic casting molds for our latches- Machining of main frames- TPU forming molds and weldingBy supporting us, you will participate in completing the design for finer details on the product as well as more uniform welding joints on the TPU material.

<p>Individuals understand that the world is facing dire consequences but beyond conventional means such as recycling and buying locally etc, they feel powerless to do more.</p>
<p>Biopod provides a simple, affordable and low maintenance solution. With Biopod, individuals can now realize the immediate effects of their contribution to the environment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>If the Biopod is used as an animal habitat, how is cleaning handled? Is there water filtration for aquarium applications?</b></p>
<p>The system is designed to reduce maintenance as it works like a self-contained ecosystem - the regular misting helps wash any waste to the ground and this is absorbed by the plants. The entire back wall acts as a biological filter for all units including the AQUA, harnessing both beneficial bacteria and plant roots to clean the water, similar to a vertically designed aquaponics system.</p>
<p><b>Does the Filter in the Biopod AQUA ever need to be changed?</b></p>
<p>The biopod living wall filter does not need changing, as the plant roots penetrate throughout the wall it works like an aquaponics system, essentially filtering water from the aquarium continually. In addition, beneficial bacteria colonize the living wall unit that work in unison with the plants to filter and detoxify the water.</p>
<p><b>What are the Biopod tanks made from?</b></p>
<p>Ultra Clear Low-Iron Glass – 5mm to 6mm depending on the unit. This is a high end, high clarity glass that does not have the green tinge of typical terrariums. Helps keep our modern look consistent</p>
<p><b>What animals are compatible with my Biopod?</b></p>
<p>The app will give recommendations for animals based on the size of each unit. While there are too any options to be listed on this site, we recommend that you consult published literature on the topic if there are specific animals you are working with or plan to put in your biopod. Keep in mind that our substrate technology allows for a very thin aerated and actively cleaned substrate, so you may not need the height commonly used for traditional terraria, which often have 6 to 8 inches of substrate.</p>
<p><b>LED lighting specs. How many Watts, what is the spectrum?</b></p>
<p>We use 3W, high output LED diodes with a colour temperature of 6000K. The diodes are designed specifically to emit a natural light spectrum with peaks at optimal wavelengths to mimic natural sunlight, helping both plant growth and vitamin D production in your pets with output of both UVA and UVB. The basic system is 36W, and up to 90 watts on current larger models such as the biopod GRAND. Total Lumen output ranges from 3600 to 9000 lumens.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>My terrarium at home gets too hot, too dry or too wet - how does Biopod cool or humidify without constant misting?</b></p>
<p>The system is capable of humidifying without misting, and precisely regulates internal humidity without causing the typical overwatering that can occur in some systems. In addition, biopod uses evaporative cooling by mixing dry air with humidified air. This is the result of the integrated BioPUR system which utilizes the action of oxygenating the substrate (with the combined effect of eliminating stagnation and humidifying the air), and a special active ventilation strip. And if you live in a hot climate or require special care for cooler species we have built biopod to accommodate a chiller unit, and this will be an add on at a later date.</p>
<p><b>What kind of Potting Soil / Substrate can be used in Biopod?</b></p>
<p>We are programming the app to give detailed instructions on setting up different habitats, as well as substrates that work best with different types of plants. In general, we recommend a base of coconut coir for most applications</p>
<p><b>What is the Warranty like? What happens if something stops working?</b></p>
<p>Biopod comes with a 1 year warranty against defect for all parts. All components are accessible from the rear of the unit, and are designed to be easily replaced. If anything goes wrong, tell us and we will send you replacement parts. If anything goes wrong after the warranty has ended, parts will be readily available and inexpensive to replace.</p>
<p><b>Do I need a WiFi connection to set up Biopod? What happens if my connection is lost? Will biopod stop working?</b></p>
<p>A WiFi connection is required only for initial setup. After the unit has been programmed, it will continue to run these programmed settings continually. So no need to worry if you lose your WiFi connection!</p>
<p><b>What are the Differences between the One, the Terra, the Aqua and the Grand?</b></p>
<p>The Biopod One is the smallest unit with a 14 U.S. gallon tank - 18""x12.5""x14"". </p>
<p>The Terra is a widescreen version of the One - it is 24.5""x14""x14"" and 21 U.S Gallons. Both the One and Terra are suitable for a terrarium style setup and can be used to grow a wide range of herbs and plants, and can be used to house a wide range of amphibians smaller lizards and small tortoises. </p>
<p>The Aqua is a taller version of the Terra 24.5x14x21"" with a volume of 31.5 gallons.</p>
<p> The Grand is currently our largest model at 49""x15""x28"" with a volume of 89 gallons. </p>
<p>Both the Aqua and Grand can be set up as a terrarium only or with a lower aquatic section for keeping fish. The maximum water capacity of the Aqua is 6.5 gallons (up to 5"" deep) and the Grand can hold 19 gallons of water - up to 6"" deep. The Aqua and the Grand are suitable for growing a wider assortment of fresh herbs or food crops, for making a larger natural plant display and are also great for keeping a wider range of different animals including larger sized lizards, snakes etc.</p>
<p>All biopods have the same great core features, including onboard App based climate control, Integrated Misting system, Full spectrum LED lighting optimized for plant growth and animal care, BioPUR air injection system to keep the environment fresh and vibrant, HD video, Remote Lock, and so much more!</p>

WHAT CAN YOU USE BIOPOD FOR?



To grow a pristine environment for your pets. Current products are poor reflections of natural habitats. They require constant upkeep and maintenance. Biopod is an enclosed ecosystem that requires limited maintenance. The Biopod App makes it easy to set up the perfect conditions for your pet's new home.


To grow a year-round garden. Biopod combines the benefits of an aquaponics system with the ideal conditions of a greenhouse – right inside your home. Just a few of the many things you can grow include herbs, lettuce, tomatoes, peas, etc… A great source for fresh salad and more! Biopod will care for your garden, measure the soil conditions and tell you when it's ready for harvest. It will optimize growth for maximum production.


To add a low-maintenance enhancement to your home decor, even in small spaces. Biopod creates a beautiful and relaxing backdrop for your living space. No time to take care of your plants? Biopod's automated, low-maintenance system will take care of everything from lighting to watering, while still offering opportunities to manually mist, seed or prune, if desired. All you have to do is enjoy the pleasure you will receive from your Biopod! A great addition for urban dwellers and seniors.


To educate minds, young and old alike. Biopod makes a great educational tool and is a fun way for kids (of any age!) to learn about nature and the delicate balance an ecosystem requires. Add a reptile to your Biopod and watch the wonderment and joy it will bring. Biopod helps to build an awareness not only of life inside the 'pod, but also of the sensitive environment all around us.


To enhance the classroom experience. Biopod makes a great educational tool for visual and hands-on learning in classroom settings. Teachers and students can see different aspects of their environment including soil conditions, gas levels and moisture- all in real time. Classrooms can share their Biopod data with other classrooms from around the world and collaborate on observations and best practices. 


To encourage creativity, productivity, lowered stress and increased well-being in the work environment. Studies show that these are benefits which can be reaped when greenery and nature are included in the work space. Biopod has a sleek and beautiful design, which is compatible with nearly any office size and decor, and the fully-automated system makes it easy to care for.

Most struggle to master their daily nutrition. Designed for a healthy lifestyle and a simple life, with the Cell One we aim to create the most effortless indoor garden solution. Along with a plant-based nutrition guide based on sprouts and microgreens, Cell One will empower you to meet and sustain your nutritional goals.  Most indoor gardening systems lack the size and ability to grow a substantial amount of fresh food. We are focusing on sprouts and microgreens since they are rich in nutrients and have a short growth period. That's why when it comes to providing fresh, unprocessed and whole food, our smart garden is the most efficient and sustainable solution on the market for indoor gardening. Perfectly designed for your lifestyle and your healthCell One is more than another shiny appliance into your kitchen. This is the foundation of a lifestyle designed to help you meet and sustain your personal goals: Whether that be weight loss, muscle gain, overall health improvement or even increasing your athletic performance: We want to bring the best food to your life! How Cell One worksFirst, fill the water tank and insert the pre-seeded biodegradable seed pod. The Cell One automatically adapts the lighting and watering cycles to ensure your sprouts and microgreens thrive. An intelligent system of irrigation, LED lighting, sensors, and ventilation controls the microclimate for ideal growth and taste.  Automate Growing – Effortlessly grow food, and never kill a plant again
 Seed PodYou have a bright verity of pre-seeded and biodegradable pods for microgreens, legumes and grain sprouts.Air circulation while sprouting is vital, and if the sprouts can’t breathe while growing - they can die. Therefore, it is critical that seeds are at an ideal distance from each other. In the Cell Garden Pod seeds are already placed in the best possible arrangement. 
The growth medium is made of natural, renewable materials, and are biodegradable. After harvesting the Cell Garden Pod can be thrown in compost bins, so Cell One is easy to maintain and keep clean.
No soil or additional substrates are needed for germination. All of the nutrients at the early microgreen stage come from the seed itself. This ensures each pod is perfectly clean, and ready to snip and eat.
To assure you the best crop we have selected high quality seeds that are organic, non-GMO and untreated (99% germinable). 
No experience required – Peel the top and pop 'em in!    

 Save Money! Microgreens, up there with gold, saffron, and perfume. What Cell One can growOn three levels of the Cell One you can soak, germinate and grow various nuts, sprouts and microgreens at the same time. In three trays you can produce 15 different types of natural and sustainable superfoods.
In the top tray, with daylight and special LED light, you can grow microgreens such as radishes, alfalfa or broccoli. 
The middle tray is particularly suitable for growing sprouts from buckwheat, oats, chickpeas, lentils and mung beans. 
In the lower tray, rice, white beans or nuts can soak.
 
WHY SOAK NUTS, GRAINS, AND SEEDS? Beans and nuts can contain substances that interfere with the body’s ability to absorb nutrients. The process of soaking and sprouting grains, beans, and nuts reduces the anti-nutrient content and makes them more beneficial to the body. Soaking all types of nuts makes them taste fresh like picked from the tree and popped straight into your mouth. Create raw food vegan desserts, that are delicious, nutrient-rich, and give you the best energy.  Cell Garden App – monitor your garden health from anywhereOptimize plant growth, monitor water and light levels and notice when it's time for harvest - with the Cell Garden App you always have everything under control.  We have even created a clean, plant-based nutrition concept and an easy-to-use, free mobile Nutrition Assistant, based on sprouts and microgreens – the easiest way to get the nutrients you need.In your Cell Garden App you get access to the Nutrition Assistant – whole food, plant-based recipes, shopping lists, meal plans and nutrition tips for a healthy lifestyle.  

 
The mobile Nutrition Assistant is everything you need to make nutritious eating delicious and convenient, without any hassle.  Sprouts & Microgreens - fast, delicious, and nutritiousSprouts and microgreens are one of nature’s greatest superfoods. In a plants development, sprouts are the first stage and microgreens are the second.
The germination period of chickpeas is typically 2–3 days.
The growth period of broccoli microgreens generally is 4–5 days.
They are also packed with vitamins and enzymes to keep you healthy.
They are easy to digest, have a high biological value, rich nutrient density and – not to mention – fresh and tasty. With Cell One microgreens thrive two times faster than typical.Nutrient-Packed: Eat fewer greens, get 10x–260x the nutrients!Researchers discovered that the microgreens contained four to 260 times more nutrients than their mature mother plant. So, eating just a handful of microgreens can get you the nutrition of a full salad.Fuel your body with nourishing eating  Our cookbook, The Superfood Assistant, is about enjoying delicious, nutritious food to help people feel their best.

<p><strong>World's Lightest Double Wall Freestanding Tent</strong></p>
<p><strong>by <a href=""http://www.bigskyinternational.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Big Sky International</a></strong></p>
<p>World's Lightest Double Wall Freestanding Tent includes a ""moon roof"" for no additional cost!</p>
<p>We have been designing tents for a number of years. We keep trying to push our designs to give our customers the most tent for the least weight.</p>
<p>We wanted to create the World's Lightest Double Wall Freestanding tent, but we are not sure if there is enough interest to make it a commercial product so we thought <em>indiegogo</em> would be a good place to find out.</p>
<p>We have already completed the design and made a prototype tent. In fact, it won the prestigious <a href=""http://www.asian-outdoor.com/html/en/Supportingprogramme/AWARD/2012"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gold Industry Award at the 2012 OutDoor Asia</a> show this summer.</p>

<p>One cool feature that was designed into the tent was the ability to roll back the fly to create ""moon roof"" for viewing the stars at night. (see picture below)</p>

<p>Another cool feature is that gear storage/vestibule area does not require stakes/pegs because it attaches to the ends of the poles (see pictures above and drawings below).</p>

by Big Sky International
World's Lightest Double Wall Freestanding Tent includes a ""moon roof"" for no additional cost!
We have been designing tents for a number of years. We keep trying to push our designs to give our customers the most tent for the least weight.
We wanted to create the World's Lightest Double Wall Freestanding tent, but we are not sure if there is enough interest to make it a commercial product so we thought indiegogo would be a good place to find out.
We have already completed the design and made a prototype tent. In fact, it won the prestigious Gold Industry Award at the 2012 OutDoor Asia show this summer.
 
 OutDoor Asia - Gold Industry Award - Big Sky Soul tent
One cool feature that was designed into the tent was the ability to roll back the fly to create ""moon roof"" for viewing the stars at night. (see picture below)

Another cool feature is that gear storage/vestibule area does not require stakes/pegs because it attaches to the ends of the poles (see pictures above and drawings below).

</p><p></p><p><br/></p>“<strong>We bring the world’s fuel gauge into every
home in America and tell you how much you’re spending on energy every few
seconds.”</strong><p></p>
<p>The goal of EnergyCite® is to commercialize
and distribute an in-home energy dashboard for people to see how much money
they are spending on energy and reduce their energy expenses. Simply put, we
bring the electric utility power meter inside the home to your fingertips and
we convert those funny numbers on the power meter to dollars and cents and
much, much more.</p><p>

This video was produced in
our design engineering and manufacturing partner’s facilities in late August,
2013 located in Xiamen &amp; Zhangzhou, China. Tom Tamarkin of EnergyCite®
&amp; Charlie Chen of Lilliput take our backers on a tour of the product
development and manufacturing facility. The products are in late stage design
and test. We plan to produce the products including those offered as Perks, in the Lilliput facility.  All screens shown in product shots are real and indicate working software.  There are no simulations.</p><p><a href=""http://www.lilliput.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b><span>Lilliput may be evaluated by clicking

dashboard in every home in America. This starts with how much electricity you
are using every hour…every minute of the day, and how much you are paying for
it. In other words we want to provide everyone with a real time electronic
tabulation of their electricity bill. We know that by doing this, people will use
electricity more wisely and save money as a result. And people will feel better
about the fairness of their electric utility company. We will do this on a
portable electronic display, PC, or smart phone and will integrate this
into home energy management systems for people ready to take that step. <p></p><p>
</p><p>We will also provide global fossil fuel and
alternative energy reserve, energy production, and energy use information in
real time. And we will provide science and energy information delivered to
these displays in plain English that everyone can understand. We believe when
we do this, an interest will be developed by people in science and energy and
just how big a task it will be to solve energy for a worldwide population
projected at over 9 billion by mid-century. As we all know our fossil fuel
reserves are finite and when they are gone, there gone. Yet few people truly
realize how close we are to that point and how this will affect the future of
their children and grandchildren. </p><p>
</p><p>We believe solving energy is the greatest
challenge our young generation faces and yet hardly anyone is talking about it.
Our vision is to be the catalyst to change that while at the same time giving
people practical tools which allow them to save money by conserving energy in
their homes today.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/jLGhbi4KeXU?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div> <p></p>
<p><b>What led us to this vision/mission?</b>: </p>
<p>As a college physics major in the 1970s I
was taught that energy would be solved by 1995 and that a new virtually
inexhaustible cheap and very green source of power would be developed and put
on line by 2000. Both electricity and synthetic liquid fuels would be produced
for thousands of years to come. However our best scientists' efforts in this
endeavor got bogged down in politics and big business interests. <a href=""http://www.usclcorp.com/conservation/docs/Magnetic_Fusion_Energy_Engineering_Act_1980fulltext.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Click here to see the Act signed by
President Carter in October 1980 which should have gotten this done.</b></a>
 The scientific projects needed to get this done came to a halt. <a href=""http://www.fusion4freedom.com/pdfs/Who%20Killed%20Fusion%2010-2011.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Click here for a very authoritative
article we wrote which explains how this happened.</b></a> So here we are decades later and not much
has happened except that our fossil fuel reserves have gotten lower and more
people around the world in developing countries are demanding a better standard
of living which takes more energy. So I thought it was high time to jump over
the barriers and bring this critically important information directly to the
people. It is such an important issue that we collaborated with Pat Boone and
wrote an 8 article series on the science, and the politics that derailed the
efforts and why we need to get back on track now.  <a href=""http://www.usclcorp.com/news.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Click on this line and then the lower line next to Pat's
picture for a link to the complete set of 8 articles.</b></a> Next,
and perhaps, foremost we do that by concentrating on what everyone is
concerned about today;<b><i> their pocket book and their money</i></b>. And in
the process we will provide some important information and facts. </p>
<p><b>Why do we need your backing?</b></p>
<p>As you go through our project
presentation you will see we have been working on this crowd source funding project for
one year. In fact the company due diligence  video section was done
with veteran investigative news reporter, Kristen Simoes, the day before
thanksgiving, 2012. Three or four days later we did the piece with singer and
actor, Pat Boone, in his office. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8KDpehzHdc"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Click here for the complete and
unedited discussion with Pat in his Hollywood office. Although long, the
YouTube advance button can be used to move through boring sections.</b></a>  A few days later we were
in Israel working on our Perks package and shooting various video
as linked in this presentation.  And recently we completed the
engineering, product development, and manufacturing video in Xiamen,
China.  All of this could make the average person think we have a big
company and lots of money behind us. We don’t. As the CBS news reporter says in
her story on us, “the man behind this works out of this house…in Carmichael,
CA…and it’s a pretty good idea.” <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jrvXiGp-tU"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Click here for the CBS News
story. </b></a></p>

The truth is we are a small
family based company with an extended family of little investors who have
chipped in a few dollars here and a few there. The key is “few.” Now we are in
a critical window to launch our product and we need your help.<br/><p></p><p>
</p><p><b>Why is our project success critical to
America and our children and grandchildren?</b></p><p>
</p><p>There are two reasons. </p><p>
</p><p>The first is that if we do not do this, the
electrical utilities will follow the lead of the big companies who want to get
government approval for new appliances based on their belief that people want
the electric utilities and/or the government to remotely manage their use of
electricity (and later natural gas and water) using remote computers connected
to every home in America….and all the major appliances located inside your
house. Over the years we have learned that this is not what most people want. People
want to know how much energy they are using and what it costs. Then people can
control it without the need for “big brother like” remote control. Today the
big companies have the ear of the U.S. Department of Energy and their “Green
Button” focuses. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoVq63mCrP0"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Here is our video explaining this
very important issue. </b></a></p><p>
</p><p>And here is a very short video
clip showing why it is important that we present this to large numbers of
citizens.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKsY7fglwGE?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div> <p></p><p>
</p><p>The second reason is that if we do not do
this our future generations will suffer greatly. There will be future wars and
energy conflicts as fossil fuels dwindle and developing countries fight to
maintain their citizens’ lives which require energy. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECFm3Hcp9gA"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Follow this link for a presentation
we prepared on this major issue. If the introduction is too boring, advance to
4 minutes and 25 seconds. </b></a></p><p>
</p><p>Most people do not understand energy and
science. Therefore there is no interest by the politicians and government to
work on long term projects like “solving energy” for our children and
grandchildren. Over the course of the EMS-2020 product development I have met
some very senior leaders. Harry Reid in the Senate for One. Eric Cantor,
Majority Leader of the House for another. Last summer I flew to the East Coast
to meet Mitt Romney in person who was running for president and I have communicated
with the current White House on this issue as well as the previous White House.
There is one common answer across all political party lines. Mr. Romney put it
bluntly: “I have to answer the person who approaches me and asks what you can
do for me over the next six months?” Or as former California Governor
Schwarzenegger lectured me in his office one time: “My voters are concerned
about the price of gasoline today. Don’t talk to me about something that will
take 20 years to show any practical results.” A very important part of what we
will do is to bring energy and science information into huge numbers of homes
throughout the country and couple it to something everyone is concerned about.
Their pocket book and household expenses. It is for that reason that we have
designed a very special series of perks based on two very
important works in energy we have commissioned.</p><p>

</p><p>We need tens of thousands – hundreds of
thousands - of people to stand up and say they want their meter data whenever
they want it and in real time. This is no different than going to the gas pump
and paying for fuel. People are entitled to it.</p><p>
</p><p>By standing with us and backing us at the
$30.00 level we file your “vote” with your utility company and the proper state
or federal regulators governing your utility. Everyone can afford to do this.
It is too important not to as explained in other sections. If we don’t do this
the utility companies will simply ignore this technology, do a few small pilot
projects in regional locations and forget about it. Then the big guys move in.
Do a Google search on <b>Meter Data Management</b> companies. These are the
companies who will profit based on their belief you do not care about how much
energy you use and how much you pay for it. These are the companies who will
tell the utility companies that they will manage your use by sending you a
consumption report over the Internet a day after you used that power!</p><p>
</p><p>Our financial goal is to raise $540,000 as
a minimum.</p><p>
</p><p>$540,000 allows us to complete the software
development and tooling needed to release the EMS-2020, Smart Plug,
Programmable Communicating Thermostat, Energy Hub and Energy Gateway and all
the mobile apps as well as our reward package based on the very important work
we are doing with Dr. Schroeder and Dr. Eliezer.</p><p>

</p><p>We are committed to rolling out all the
hardware products and software to support the PC and mobile apps within four
months of the release of funds to us. As can be seen in the video,
we have the resources in terms of people and equipment to do this.</p><p>
</p><p>Because this is a technology development
program we will be posting progress updates as we go. We want to bring our
backers inside the company so to speak to watch as we move forward.</p><p>
</p><p>Stretching our goal by a factor of two to
the $1,080,000 level lets us reach more people. It will, among other things

</p><p>
</p><p>Our perks have been very carefully thought out.<span>  We have been working on them for well over a
year.  Our perks are wholly consistent
with the primary objective of our project which is the dissemination of
information on science and energy and the provision to utility customers with
tools to help them conserve energy and save money.  Our goal is to make you a part of building a
new generation of curious young people interested in science and helping the
world become a more rational and inhabitable place for our future generations.</span></p>
<p>Few people realize that energy will become the most
serious problem the world faces.<span> 
Why?  Because most all of our
energy today comes from fossil fuels and when they are depleted the world goes
dark for the majority of people.  Sure
everyone has heard the phrase “just go green,” but how many people know what
that means and to what extent it is possible. 
That is why we have developed the EMS-2020 product line and why an
integral portion of it is the delivery of science and energy information. Our
EnergyCite® network has the potential to deliver science and energy information
and media content to every home in America. 
Energy is fundamental to transportation, comfortable housing, industrial
output, agriculture, and potable water.</span></p>
<p>To underscore the importance of conservation and an
understanding of the science of energy, we have designed our EMS-2020 hardware
product line to support “media delivery” including video and electronic books.</p>
<p>On April 28, 2009 we contacted President Obama
regarding the energy situation.<span>  Click
here for our letter to him and note the paragraph highlighted in yellow on page
3. </span><a href=""http://www.fusion4freedom.com/pdfs/President%20B%20H%20Obama%20Letter%20TT%20Rev%203.1-1.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.fusion4freedom.com/pdfs/President%20B%20H%20Obama%20Letter%20TT%20Rev%203.1-1.pdf</a><span>  Note our call for the energy analysis. It was
never done.  Six months later we hired
well-known and well published scientists to conduct such an energy analysis.  It confirmed what we have always known;
alternative energy as we know it today would provide only enough energy to meet
3.7% of 2050 worldwide energy demand. 
Click here for that initial report:</span> <a href=""http://www.fusion4freedom.com/pdfs/Worldwide%20Energy%20Supply%20%26%20Demand%20Study%20USCL%20V1%20Rev%205.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.fusion4freedom.com/pdfs/Worldwide%20Energy%20Supply%20%26%20Demand%20Study%20USCL%20V1%20Rev%205.pdf</a></p>
<p>If that analysis peaks your interest please click
here for a free copy of David MacKay’s book <b><i>“Sustainable Energy-Without the
hot air.”</i></b><span>  We have posted the
entire book as well as a short ten page synopsis.  </span><a href=""http://www.fusion4freedom.com/pdfs/SustainEbook.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.fusion4freedom.com/pdfs/SustainEbook.pdf</a><span>  </span></p>
<p>The problem we have run into over the years is that
these stubborn facts don’t support “just go green.”<span>  Yes you can run a house on solar cells.  With enough solar cells and batteries the
house can be self-sufficient (except when the air conditioning is turned
on.)  However, did you know that the
average American uses well over 100 times more energy in their car per month
than in their home?  Why?  One horse power =746 Watts.  A car with a 250 horse power engine takes
186,500 Watts or 186 kW at full engine load. 
Your home electrical service only provides 24 kW.  Ok, you charge your electric car batteries
over several hours, but how much energy do you really get in terms of how many
miles your electric car can be driven? 
And…did you know there is a relationship between energy, power, and
period time?  Needless to say most people
do not think about these things.  And
they would look at the report linked above and find it dry, boring, and
incomprehensible.  That is where we come
in.</span></p>
<p>We have engaged two Ph.D. physicists’ s and authors
in Israel to write two exciting and thought provoking books for us.<span>  And they will be the beginning of the energy
“reading and learning” material our EMS-2020 will present.</span></p>
<p><b>Shalom
&amp; Yaffa Eliezer Book Perk:</b></p>
<p>Dr. Shalom Eliezer, formerly of the Plasma Physics
Department, Soreq Nuclear Research Center in Yavne, Israel, and his wife Yaffa,
formerly with the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, are writing
a new book for us which will make energy and the science of energy both
accessible and fun for people who have no formal training in science.<span>  Their book will treat the issue of “energy
flux density” and will provide a detailed but plain English case for why the
green alternatives as we know them today are good but totally insufficient to
power the world when fossil fuels are gone. They will conclusively show how
much time we have left.  And they will
explain the only realistic solution to correctly solving energy without nuclear
radioactivity and without greenhouse gases which may contribute to climate
change.  Dr. Eliezer has written nearly a
dozen scholarly graduate level books as well as one work for the scientifically
lay titled <b><i>“The Fourth State of Matter; An Introduction to Plasma Science” </i></b>which
NASA called a fun and important book. 
Click on this link for a free copy of that work as a sample of what is
to come: </span><a href=""http://www.fusion4freedom.com/pdfs/FourthState.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.fusion4freedom.com/pdfs/FourthState.pdf</a></p>
<p>And a word about page 104 of that book.<span>  It is very outdated. The curves shown from
Lawrence Livermore National Labs are about 100 years further out than what is
accepted today.  Why?  No one took into consideration the energy
needs of the developing world then. 
Remember the U.S. only has 4% of the world population.  Other people have to eat and be comfortable
too.  Our new book will be totally
updated.  And this will be used to get
the word out to lots of people that we really do need to fix energy.  Otherwise future generations will be in
jeopardy.</span></p>

and Yaffa Eliezer and Tom Tamarkin in Rehovot, Israel:<span>  </span><a href=""http://www.fusion4freedom.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.fusion4freedom.com/</a></p>
<p><b>Gerald
Schroeder Book Perk:</b></p>
<p>Dr. Gerald Schroeder, a MIT Alumni, past associate
with the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and bestselling non-fiction
author of 4 well known books, is writing a new fifth book for us on the
philosophy of energy and the moral imperative to solve energy correctly for our
children’s and grandchildren’s sake.<span>  Dr.
Schroeder has a rich following around the world with his popular books.  Click here to learn more about Gerald
Schroeder and his background: </span><a href=""http://geraldschroeder.com/wordpress/?page_id=2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://geraldschroeder.com/wordpress/?page_id=2#</a></p>

Israel:<span>  </span><a href=""http://www.fusion4freedom.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.fusion4freedom.com/</a><span>  </span></p>
<p>Why have we chosen Israeli scholars to do this for
us?<span>  Simply put these issues are too
politically hot to handle for most scientists in the United States.  No one wants to get cross with the people
funding laboratories or universities, whatever that source is.  Israel being a very small country with few
natural energy resources is immune from such influences and at the same time
rich in scientific acumen.  It is for
this reason that we have been working in Israel for many years with groups such
as the Ariel University Center as described in a 2008 company brochure, section
05, Differentiation as has been posted to our team’s Web site for the last 5
years at:  </span><a href=""http://www.usclcorp.com/investors/docs/Offering%20Brochure_Rev%209.0-1.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.usclcorp.com/investors/docs/Offering%20Brochure_Rev%209.0-1.pdf</a><span>  (Remember what we said about the utility
industry moving at the speed of a glacier.)</span></p>
<p><b>Workshop
Perks:</b></p>
<p>Our most exciting set of perks are the opportunity
to participate in our upcoming two day workshop in Israel with Dr. Schroeder
and Dr. Eliezer on the content and organization of their books.<span>  Our most prestigious reward is the
opportunity to have this workshop named for you as a legacy for your
family.  However, even in the event our
higher cost rewards are not funded, this workshop will be held and video
coverage will be available to all backers regardless of size.</span></p>
<p>Our intent is to make these books accessible to
everyone and we full well know that in our busy world today, not everyone is
going to take the time to read a book; especially one they think may be heavy
or intimidating.<span>  Our expanded goal plans
will allow us to produce these in audio book format with professional readers,
music, and studio work.</span></p>

</p><p>The primary challenge with this project is
not all backers will be living in areas with deployed smart meters. And very few
if any will have the Home Area Network radio transceiver inside their smart
meter activated by their utility. Thus, the primary risk is can we place enough
pressure on your utility to get your smart meter HAN turned on and/or to get
your utility to replace your old fashion meter with a modern smart meter with
the HAN radio transceiver. We mitigate that risk be providing many useful
features including the thermostat, smart plug, and energy monitoring without
the meter connectivity. As importantly the work we are doing with Dr. Schroeder
and Dr. Eliezer will be the basis of a national movement to get energy
correctly solved and that alone is a hugely important effort. That results from
the rewards of our project. And you get the EMS-2020 to read the books on just
like a Kindle …but more.</p>
<p>There is some risk associated with getting
the radio wave ZigBee signal from the power meter inside the home. That relates
to the fact that the power level of the radio transmitter in the power meter is
very low and a significant portion 

</p><p>of the signal gets adsorbed by the home
construction materials because power meters in the United States are located
outdoors. We are aware of the radio propagation issues with ZigBee and Wi-Fi.
It is for that reason that part of our stretch goals include the completion of
technology developed by Yitran, our partner in Beer Sheva, Israel, which takes
the ZigBee radio signal and brings it inside the home over the power wires.

home in America and tell you how much you’re spending on energy every few
seconds.”
The goal of EnergyCite® is to commercialize
and distribute an in-home energy dashboard for people to see how much money
they are spending on energy and reduce their energy expenses. Simply put, we
bring the electric utility power meter inside the home to your fingertips and
we convert those funny numbers on the power meter to dollars and cents and
much, much more.

This video was produced in
our design engineering and manufacturing partner’s facilities in late August,
2013 located in Xiamen & Zhangzhou, China. Tom Tamarkin of EnergyCite®
& Charlie Chen of Lilliput take our backers on a tour of the product
development and manufacturing facility. The products are in late stage design
and test. We plan to produce the products including those offered as Perks, in the Lilliput facility.  All screens shown in product shots are real and indicate working software.  There are no simulations.Lilliput may be evaluated by clicking
here.
Our vision is to put the world’s energy
dashboard in every home in America. This starts with how much electricity you
are using every hour…every minute of the day, and how much you are paying for
it. In other words we want to provide everyone with a real time electronic
tabulation of their electricity bill. We know that by doing this, people will use
electricity more wisely and save money as a result. And people will feel better
about the fairness of their electric utility company. We will do this on a
portable electronic display, PC, or smart phone and will integrate this
into home energy management systems for people ready to take that step. 
We will also provide global fossil fuel and
alternative energy reserve, energy production, and energy use information in
real time. And we will provide science and energy information delivered to
these displays in plain English that everyone can understand. We believe when
we do this, an interest will be developed by people in science and energy and
just how big a task it will be to solve energy for a worldwide population
projected at over 9 billion by mid-century. As we all know our fossil fuel
reserves are finite and when they are gone, there gone. Yet few people truly
realize how close we are to that point and how this will affect the future of
their children and grandchildren. 
We believe solving energy is the greatest
challenge our young generation faces and yet hardly anyone is talking about it.
Our vision is to be the catalyst to change that while at the same time giving
people practical tools which allow them to save money by conserving energy in
their homes today. 
What led us to this vision/mission?: 
As a college physics major in the 1970s I
was taught that energy would be solved by 1995 and that a new virtually
inexhaustible cheap and very green source of power would be developed and put
on line by 2000. Both electricity and synthetic liquid fuels would be produced
for thousands of years to come. However our best scientists' efforts in this
endeavor got bogged down in politics and big business interests. Click here to see the Act signed by
President Carter in October 1980 which should have gotten this done.
 The scientific projects needed to get this done came to a halt. Click here for a very authoritative
article we wrote which explains how this happened. So here we are decades later and not much
has happened except that our fossil fuel reserves have gotten lower and more
people around the world in developing countries are demanding a better standard
of living which takes more energy. So I thought it was high time to jump over
the barriers and bring this critically important information directly to the
people. It is such an important issue that we collaborated with Pat Boone and
wrote an 8 article series on the science, and the politics that derailed the
efforts and why we need to get back on track now.  Click on this line and then the lower line next to Pat's
picture for a link to the complete set of 8 articles. Next,
and perhaps, foremost we do that by concentrating on what everyone is
concerned about today; their pocket book and their money. And in
the process we will provide some important information and facts. 
Why do we need your backing?
As you go through our project
presentation you will see we have been working on this crowd source funding project for
one year. In fact the company due diligence  video section was done
with veteran investigative news reporter, Kristen Simoes, the day before
thanksgiving, 2012. Three or four days later we did the piece with singer and
actor, Pat Boone, in his office. Click here for the complete and
unedited discussion with Pat in his Hollywood office. Although long, the
YouTube advance button can be used to move through boring sections.  A few days later we were
in Israel working on our Perks package and shooting various video
as linked in this presentation.  And recently we completed the
engineering, product development, and manufacturing video in Xiamen,
China.  All of this could make the average person think we have a big
company and lots of money behind us. We don’t. As the CBS news reporter says in
her story on us, “the man behind this works out of this house…in Carmichael,
CA…and it’s a pretty good idea.” Click here for the CBS News
story. 

The truth is we are a small
family based company with an extended family of little investors who have
chipped in a few dollars here and a few there. The key is “few.” Now we are in
a critical window to launch our product and we need your help.
Why is our project success critical to
America and our children and grandchildren?
There are two reasons. 
The first is that if we do not do this, the
electrical utilities will follow the lead of the big companies who want to get
government approval for new appliances based on their belief that people want
the electric utilities and/or the government to remotely manage their use of
electricity (and later natural gas and water) using remote computers connected
to every home in America….and all the major appliances located inside your
house. Over the years we have learned that this is not what most people want. People
want to know how much energy they are using and what it costs. Then people can
control it without the need for “big brother like” remote control. Today the
big companies have the ear of the U.S. Department of Energy and their “Green
Button” focuses. Here is our video explaining this
very important issue. 
And here is a very short video
clip showing why it is important that we present this to large numbers of
citizens. 
The second reason is that if we do not do
this our future generations will suffer greatly. There will be future wars and
energy conflicts as fossil fuels dwindle and developing countries fight to
maintain their citizens’ lives which require energy. Follow this link for a presentation
we prepared on this major issue. If the introduction is too boring, advance to
4 minutes and 25 seconds. 
Most people do not understand energy and
science. Therefore there is no interest by the politicians and government to
work on long term projects like “solving energy” for our children and
grandchildren. Over the course of the EMS-2020 product development I have met
some very senior leaders. Harry Reid in the Senate for One. Eric Cantor,
Majority Leader of the House for another. Last summer I flew to the East Coast
to meet Mitt Romney in person who was running for president and I have communicated
with the current White House on this issue as well as the previous White House.
There is one common answer across all political party lines. Mr. Romney put it
bluntly: “I have to answer the person who approaches me and asks what you can
do for me over the next six months?” Or as former California Governor
Schwarzenegger lectured me in his office one time: “My voters are concerned
about the price of gasoline today. Don’t talk to me about something that will
take 20 years to show any practical results.” A very important part of what we
will do is to bring energy and science information into huge numbers of homes
throughout the country and couple it to something everyone is concerned about.
Their pocket book and household expenses. It is for that reason that we have
designed a very special series of perks based on two very
important works in energy we have commissioned.
Why we are uniquely
qualified to get this project done?
As I said, we are a small group but we will
grow very quickly. Jeremy mentioned Governor Schwarzenegger’s comment about
“its time to return the power to the people.” That was made in Tel Aviv, Israel
on May 1, 2004 and here is the official State of California photo of the
Governor talking to Jeremy’s mother (my wife) along with the former Prime
Minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert. 



And here a few years later is the Governor
lecturing me not to talk about long term things. Note in this picture his eyes
are closed to insure no photo opportunity this time around. 
One has to have a lot of patience and thick
skin to take this on. And one also has to know what they are doing, where they
are going and how to get there. Click here and see what we have done without big money and
big company influence.
Each bullet line has an ending with a link
to the supporting documents. And yes, I was the inventor of the “smart meter.” Click here to see its history and
introduction in 1992 and scroll down and down to the “brochure pages on Peak
Demand and TOU rates and Energy Management System in-home display.
As I said in our expanded full length project video,  Jeremy was there with his funny green bottom tennis
shoes. Jeremy is pretty smart as well. At age 11 he made his first television
appearance when CBS News affiliate Channel 2 in Reno Nevada came to our house
to interview him. Click here for the KTVN story on
Jeremy and how he upset his friends with his invention.

renewal application on file with the United States Patent and Trademark office.
GOALS:
We need tens of thousands – hundreds of
thousands - of people to stand up and say they want their meter data whenever
they want it and in real time. This is no different than going to the gas pump
and paying for fuel. People are entitled to it.
By standing with us and backing us at the
$30.00 level we file your “vote” with your utility company and the proper state
or federal regulators governing your utility. Everyone can afford to do this.
It is too important not to as explained in other sections. If we don’t do this
the utility companies will simply ignore this technology, do a few small pilot
projects in regional locations and forget about it. Then the big guys move in.
Do a Google search on Meter Data Management companies. These are the
companies who will profit based on their belief you do not care about how much
energy you use and how much you pay for it. These are the companies who will
tell the utility companies that they will manage your use by sending you a
consumption report over the Internet a day after you used that power!
Our financial goal is to raise $540,000 as
a minimum.
$540,000 allows us to complete the software
development and tooling needed to release the EMS-2020, Smart Plug,
Programmable Communicating Thermostat, Energy Hub and Energy Gateway and all
the mobile apps as well as our reward package based on the very important work
we are doing with Dr. Schroeder and Dr. Eliezer.
Click here to see us with ourengineering and manufacturing partner in Xiamen, China. We are inthe late stages of production engineering and commercialization.  Workingpre-release product is shown.   The video shows the R&D engineering,production engineering, injection plastic molding with on site hard steel tooldevelopment and state of the art SMT production with clean room.
We are committed to rolling out all the
hardware products and software to support the PC and mobile apps within four
months of the release of funds to us. As can be seen in the video,
we have the resources in terms of people and equipment to do this.
Because this is a technology development
program we will be posting progress updates as we go. We want to bring our
backers inside the company so to speak to watch as we move forward.
Stretching our goal by a factor of two to
the $1,080,000 level lets us reach more people. It will, among other things
allow us to replace the funny and amateurish “space ship” scene in our very
economically produced video with a new sci-fi like video meant to
go viral to reach our one million Utility “voters” goal. Click here for a family shareholder
with two of our members who are in the sci-fi television production writing and
movie business (Hans Beimler and Eduardo Rossoff.) They just shook
their heads and laughed at our space ship shot. And as everyone can tell we
have no acting experience.
Stretching our goals by a factor of 4 or
more allows us to complete the power line carrier interface needed in some
cases to get the ZigBee radio signal from the meter to the in-home network or
display, and get our Dr. Schroeder and Eliezer content out into audio book
form, and video production begun for our EnergyCite distribution and launch the
EnergyCite® consortium discussed with Pat Boone in the video and moves the
company forward as a “going concern” in keeping with the EnergyCite® Roadmap.
The Perks:

Our perks have been very carefully thought out.  We have been working on them for well over a
year.  Our perks are wholly consistent
with the primary objective of our project which is the dissemination of
information on science and energy and the provision to utility customers with
tools to help them conserve energy and save money.  Our goal is to make you a part of building a
new generation of curious young people interested in science and helping the
world become a more rational and inhabitable place for our future generations.
Few people realize that energy will become the most
serious problem the world faces. 
Why?  Because most all of our
energy today comes from fossil fuels and when they are depleted the world goes
dark for the majority of people.  Sure
everyone has heard the phrase “just go green,” but how many people know what
that means and to what extent it is possible. 
That is why we have developed the EMS-2020 product line and why an
integral portion of it is the delivery of science and energy information. Our
EnergyCite® network has the potential to deliver science and energy information
and media content to every home in America. 
Energy is fundamental to transportation, comfortable housing, industrial
output, agriculture, and potable water.
To underscore the importance of conservation and an
understanding of the science of energy, we have designed our EMS-2020 hardware
product line to support “media delivery” including video and electronic books.
On April 28, 2009 we contacted President Obama
regarding the energy situation.  Click
here for our letter to him and note the paragraph highlighted in yellow on page
3. http://www.fusion4freedom.com/pdfs/President%20B%20H%20Obama%20Letter%20TT%20Rev%203.1-1.pdf  Note our call for the energy analysis. It was
never done.  Six months later we hired
well-known and well published scientists to conduct such an energy analysis.  It confirmed what we have always known;
alternative energy as we know it today would provide only enough energy to meet
3.7% of 2050 worldwide energy demand. 
Click here for that initial report: http://www.fusion4freedom.com/pdfs/Worldwide%20Energy%20Supply%20%26%20Demand%20Study%20USCL%20V1%20Rev%205.pdf
If that analysis peaks your interest please click
here for a free copy of David MacKay’s book “Sustainable Energy-Without the
hot air.”  We have posted the
entire book as well as a short ten page synopsis.  http://www.fusion4freedom.com/pdfs/SustainEbook.pdf  
The problem we have run into over the years is that
these stubborn facts don’t support “just go green.”  Yes you can run a house on solar cells.  With enough solar cells and batteries the
house can be self-sufficient (except when the air conditioning is turned
on.)  However, did you know that the
average American uses well over 100 times more energy in their car per month
than in their home?  Why?  One horse power =746 Watts.  A car with a 250 horse power engine takes
186,500 Watts or 186 kW at full engine load. 
Your home electrical service only provides 24 kW.  Ok, you charge your electric car batteries
over several hours, but how much energy do you really get in terms of how many
miles your electric car can be driven? 
And…did you know there is a relationship between energy, power, and
period time?  Needless to say most people
do not think about these things.  And
they would look at the report linked above and find it dry, boring, and
incomprehensible.  That is where we come
in.
We have engaged two Ph.D. physicists’ s and authors
in Israel to write two exciting and thought provoking books for us.  And they will be the beginning of the energy
“reading and learning” material our EMS-2020 will present.
Shalom
& Yaffa Eliezer Book Perk:
Dr. Shalom Eliezer, formerly of the Plasma Physics
Department, Soreq Nuclear Research Center in Yavne, Israel, and his wife Yaffa,
formerly with the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, are writing
a new book for us which will make energy and the science of energy both
accessible and fun for people who have no formal training in science.  Their book will treat the issue of “energy
flux density” and will provide a detailed but plain English case for why the
green alternatives as we know them today are good but totally insufficient to
power the world when fossil fuels are gone. They will conclusively show how
much time we have left.  And they will
explain the only realistic solution to correctly solving energy without nuclear
radioactivity and without greenhouse gases which may contribute to climate
change.  Dr. Eliezer has written nearly a
dozen scholarly graduate level books as well as one work for the scientifically
lay titled “The Fourth State of Matter; An Introduction to Plasma Science” which
NASA called a fun and important book. 
Click on this link for a free copy of that work as a sample of what is
to come: http://www.fusion4freedom.com/pdfs/FourthState.pdf
And a word about page 104 of that book.  It is very outdated. The curves shown from
Lawrence Livermore National Labs are about 100 years further out than what is
accepted today.  Why?  No one took into consideration the energy
needs of the developing world then. 
Remember the U.S. only has 4% of the world population.  Other people have to eat and be comfortable
too.  Our new book will be totally
updated.  And this will be used to get
the word out to lots of people that we really do need to fix energy.  Otherwise future generations will be in
jeopardy.

Gerald
Schroeder Book Perk:
Dr. Gerald Schroeder, a MIT Alumni, past associate
with the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and bestselling non-fiction
author of 4 well known books, is writing a new fifth book for us on the
philosophy of energy and the moral imperative to solve energy correctly for our

Click on this link and scroll down to the two part
video discussion with Dr. Gerald Schroeder and Tom Tamarkin in Jerusalem,
Israel:  http://www.fusion4freedom.com/  
Why have we chosen Israeli scholars to do this for
us?  Simply put these issues are too
politically hot to handle for most scientists in the United States.  No one wants to get cross with the people
funding laboratories or universities, whatever that source is.  Israel being a very small country with few
natural energy resources is immune from such influences and at the same time
rich in scientific acumen.  It is for
this reason that we have been working in Israel for many years with groups such
as the Ariel University Center as described in a 2008 company brochure, section
05, Differentiation as has been posted to our team’s Web site for the last 5
years at:  http://www.usclcorp.com/investors/docs/Offering%20Brochure_Rev%209.0-1.pdf  (Remember what we said about the utility
industry moving at the speed of a glacier.)
Workshop
Perks:
Our most exciting set of perks are the opportunity
to participate in our upcoming two day workshop in Israel with Dr. Schroeder
and Dr. Eliezer on the content and organization of their books.  Our most prestigious reward is the
opportunity to have this workshop named for you as a legacy for your
family.  However, even in the event our
higher cost rewards are not funded, this workshop will be held and video
coverage will be available to all backers regardless of size.
Our intent is to make these books accessible to
everyone and we full well know that in our busy world today, not everyone is
going to take the time to read a book; especially one they think may be heavy
or intimidating.  Our expanded goal plans
will allow us to produce these in audio book format with professional readers,
music, and studio work.

Funding Campaign Going Forward Plan:

We know our 
backers want to know that they are backing not only the completion of our
EMS-2020 produce devices for shipment as part of the Perks package but that
we are building a great sustainable company for the long term.  Click here to view our plan. Risks & Challenges:
The primary challenge with this project is
not all backers will be living in areas with deployed smart meters. And very few
if any will have the Home Area Network radio transceiver inside their smart
meter activated by their utility. Thus, the primary risk is can we place enough
pressure on your utility to get your smart meter HAN turned on and/or to get
your utility to replace your old fashion meter with a modern smart meter with
the HAN radio transceiver. We mitigate that risk be providing many useful
features including the thermostat, smart plug, and energy monitoring without
the meter connectivity. As importantly the work we are doing with Dr. Schroeder
and Dr. Eliezer will be the basis of a national movement to get energy
correctly solved and that alone is a hugely important effort. That results from
the rewards of our project. And you get the EMS-2020 to read the books on just
like a Kindle …but more.
There is some risk associated with getting
the radio wave ZigBee signal from the power meter inside the home. That relates
to the fact that the power level of the radio transmitter in the power meter is
very low and a significant portion 

of the signal gets adsorbed by the home
construction materials because power meters in the United States are located
outdoors. We are aware of the radio propagation issues with ZigBee and Wi-Fi.
It is for that reason that part of our stretch goals include the completion of
technology developed by Yitran, our partner in Beer Sheva, Israel, which takes
the ZigBee radio signal and brings it inside the home over the power wires.
Click here for the two part video with Tom Tamarkin and Yitran in Beer Sheva: http://www.youtube.com/watch… 
Click here for part 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch…
This explains how we will get the signal inside the home if and when radio does
not work.

<br/> <p>We live in a very complex day and age. Long gone are the times of hunting, gathering and staring at campfires in caves. Whether this is for good or for bad I will leave in the middle.</p>
<p>Basic survival skills have melded with the ability to eat while watching TV, to read while listening to music and to talk while not really listening. Again, good or bad is left in the middle.</p>
<p>But this is our reality never the less. I, admittedly being a bit chaotic, find myself too often in the following manifestation of that reality:</p>
<p><i>""I put a few eggs in a pan, add water, put it on the stove and then return to my computer to resume working. Then after about 20 or 30 minutes, my subconscious slaps me in the face and reminds me that those eggs have now transcended into rocks."" - me, way too often.</i><br/></p>
<p>Well, no more of that! Technology has come to our aid: MONEO, the somewhat smart kitchen timer. It has a nifty infrared sensor that can tell how hot an object is, and infer from that information whether the water has started boiling yet or the eggs are done. A friendly reminder lets you know dinner's ready. Of course this doesn't end with eggs (as life rarely does); you can use it for soup (don't let it boil, trust me), checking the temperature of your pan, really anything that involves temperature and time. You can even set multiple timers on it! What kitchen timer does that?!<br/></p>
<p>So why should you be confident in me solving this enigma? For starters, I'm very passionate about it, seeing as how it keeps biting me in the ##s. I'm tech-educated as you can see on <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/samkraaijveld"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my LinkedIn profile</a> and I've been building electronics for ages (got my first kit at the age of 7). I have access to a great hackerspace from my old university; 3D printers, laser cutters and knowledge galore! Besides that I have a pretty nice rig myself;</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132131/files/20150105032754-WP_20141219_001_small.jpg?1420457274"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>If you still have questions as to why this project should even come to life (for example; 'But why not use a regular kitchen timer?'), please refer to the 'but why' section below.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1131974/files/20150105010846-the_road_ahead.png?1420448926"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Currently I have gathered a few facts from iterative developing and testing:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>The temperature of an object can be measured by the sensor used, from a safe distance to avoid melting from the heat.</li>
<li>The temperature of the outside of a pan is adequate to determine the inside temperature. With use of calibration this becomes 100%.</li>
<li>Even though the ideal diameter of a pan is at least 20cm (7.8''), smaller pans can also be used because the temperature difference between the pan and the room is so significant.</li>
<br/>
</ul>
<p>The current setup (M1) uses an <a href=""http://arduino.cc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arduino</a> in conjunction with the <a href=""http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Infrared-Temperature-Sensor-p-1058.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seeed Infrared Sensor</a> for rapid development. I developed a C# test application for measuring and testing:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132011/files/20150105014807-App_Screen.png?1420451287"" src="""" style=""width: 245px; height: 328px;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The next iteration (M2) will have the code rewritten to C and have it transferred to a <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardNano"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arduino Nano 3.0</a> board. A 1.8-inch TFT SPI Serial 128 x 160 will be used so the link with the laptop will be gone and it will become autonomous. At this point I will begin developing the rest of the timer code and make it useable with standard input buttons. Note that if the 1.8-inch screen is deemed 'too much' for final use (don't want MONEO from distracting us from actually using it, which would require a second MONEO to remind us to use the MONEO, which in the end would result in a world filled with infinite MONEOs), a smaller screen will be used. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When M2 is finished and properly tested, I will begin revising the needed items of the Arduino board so I can design and build a custom, cheaper board. This will be M3 and will be the completion of the hardware/software phase. Buyers of the 'Stripped MONEO' perk will receive the custom board + sensor at this stage.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>NOTE: If you would like to receive a MONEO with an Arduino Nano board inside so you can easily upgrade/modify it yourself, please contact me and we'll work it out.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now the case-designing will take place, since at this point we know the measurements of the components. A draft of the model has already been completed:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132035/files/20150105020115-Design_01_M3.png?1420452075"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>This is not the final color-scheme but just a rendering. The top part will contain the infrared sensor and should be aimed at the object of measurement. The rest is fairly obvious. The casing will be 3D printed into two parts, which allows adding the components and will then be glued together. Sanding and painting will complete the MONEO.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWaWKxKLBKjw&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FWaWKxKLBKjw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As noted I will not mass-produce MONEO (at this point in time). I do not yet have the required experience/knowledge, however I am teaming up with people that do so who knows what the future holds. The cool part of the current setup is however that every MONEO will be hand built by me, and only a few of them will exist. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132332/files/20150105055700-perks.png?1420466220"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There are perks (something you get in return for donating in this campaign) in different sizes &amp; shapes - look for them on the right side of this page. I don't actually make money from the MONEOs themselves, so if you feel like supporting me financially for my time &amp; energy invested please consider donating a little extra. You can do so after selecting the perk. <br/></p>
<p>It goes without saying that there should be a t-shirt, and so there is:</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>They come in all sizes, genders and in black or white, so let me know your wishes when ordering  :)</p>

<p>Please remember to add delivery costs to the amount. You can use <a href=""https://www.dhlparcel.nl/en/private/ship-parcel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the DHL site</a> to determine the amount or contact me on specifics, locations in the EU may be cheaper.

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1131975/files/20150105010857-but_why.png?1420448937"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><b>But why not use a regular kitchen timer?</b><br/><br/>That does sound like an obvious solution if all you want to measure is time. But since there's no exact curve as to when your water will boil (there are a bunch of variables; room temperature, number of eggs, size of eggs, amount of water - and this is just for the eggs example), this isn't a fitting solution when more factors are in play. For example: wait until the water boils, then let me know when 4 minutes have passed.<br/><br/><b>But why not use an egg cooker?</b><br/><br/>I did try one of those once, they did not work for me at all (picture water overflowing and eggs getting wasted). Most likely I was doing something wrong, or mine was defective, but it wasn't a pleasant experience. Besides that, it's another big appliance for only one use case.<br/><br/><b>But why are you using an infrared sensor?</b><br/><br/>I thought of and tried multiple angles, for example <a href=""https://www.sparkfun.com/products/251"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a> or <a href=""https://www.sparkfun.com/products/250"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a> or <a href=""http://www.analog.com/en/other-products/ios-subsystems/ac2626/products/product.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a>, but they aren't very practical. You'd have to clean them, they might melt, plastic would get mixed in your food, I'd get sued for negligence - it'd be a mess. Decent infrared sensors are a bit more expensive but worth it in the end.<br/><br/><b>But why can't you just stay by the kitchen?</b><br/><br/>Because staring at stuff in the kitchen might be relaxing once but gets boring to do every day. I'm not talking about cooking up large meals of course, but even then MONEO can help - so you can put your focus on not cutting your fingers, or use it to set multiple timers.<br/><br/><b>But why can't I buy one for 3 bucks like regular timers? Are you getting rich?</b><br/><br/>I know today's industrialized outsourced industry allows for very cheap mass production, but this gem is completely built by hand and in small quantities. I'm not getting bulk discounts and 3D printing is not cheap. If you're thinking I'm getting rich over this, I'm not. The standard MONEO perk contains absolutely no profit if you account for the time and energy I have to put in making every single one of them. If you leave those factors out, they'd be about 3 to 5 bucks cheaper. That's excluding delivery &amp; packaging costs.<br/><br/>So if you do feel generous and want to support me, consider paying a bit more for them. But buying them in the first place is already awesome support for what I'm doing :)<br/><br/><b>But why are you using an Arduino? OMG overkill!</b><br/><br/>Yes quite, but it puts the rapid in rapid development while still allowing to add/remove modules (screens, buttons, sensors) on the fly without redoing schematics. Don't worry, it'll get toned down in the final product.<br/><br/><b>But what if I want to build one myself?</b><br/><br/>Big fan of open source, so the designs + source code will be free for all in the end. You can just wait it out and build off of that! Link it to your domotica system, make it smarter, make it interact with your smartphone, sky's not even the limit anymore - launch it into space, see how hot it is there ;)<br/><br/>Maybe grab a shirt from the perks to keep you warm while waiting?<br/><br/><b>But what if you don't make the funding goal? What will become of my money?</b><br/><br/>That depends on your perk. Because every MONEO is hand built and doesn't require bulk ordering of parts, if you bought one, you'll most likely still get one. If only a few get ordered, it'll get a little rough to buy the parts since <a href=""https://go.indiegogo.com/pricing-fees"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">indiegogo will keep 9% when the funding goal isn't reached instead of the usual 4%.</a> But I'll get in touch with everyone in that case to determine the best course of action.<br/><br/>You can help avoiding this scenario by letting everyone you know hear about MONEO, be it through social media or at parties!<br/><br/>If you ordered a t-shirt, you get one without delay. If you donated, it'll still be used for developing more projects like MONEO, and will still be appreciated just as much!<br/><br/><br/><b>Have any more 'but why's? Please let me know, I'll add them!</b><br/><br/><p><br/></p>

<br/>No journey is without risks, and this one is not exempt from that rule. Even though the basic science behind the concept has been proven (it'd suck if I'd built the MONEO just to find it won't work), there are still hurdles to overtake.<br/><br/><b>Battery life</b><br/><br/>The MONEO will work on AA batteries, stored in the bottom. It will have a hardware on/off switch, and will use no power (not even 'standby' power) when off. Screen estate will be minimal; nice to use but not Ultra Mega Full HD Extra Plus.

</div></div>","We live in a very complex day and age. Long gone are the times of hunting, gathering and staring at campfires in caves. Whether this is for good or for bad I will leave in the middle.
Basic survival skills have melded with the ability to eat while watching TV, to read while listening to music and to talk while not really listening. Again, good or bad is left in the middle.
But this is our reality never the less. I, admittedly being a bit chaotic, find myself too often in the following manifestation of that reality:
""I put a few eggs in a pan, add water, put it on the stove and then return to my computer to resume working. Then after about 20 or 30 minutes, my subconscious slaps me in the face and reminds me that those eggs have now transcended into rocks."" - me, way too often.
Well, no more of that! Technology has come to our aid: MONEO, the somewhat smart kitchen timer. It has a nifty infrared sensor that can tell how hot an object is, and infer from that information whether the water has started boiling yet or the eggs are done. A friendly reminder lets you know dinner's ready. Of course this doesn't end with eggs (as life rarely does); you can use it for soup (don't let it boil, trust me), checking the temperature of your pan, really anything that involves temperature and time. You can even set multiple timers on it! What kitchen timer does that?!
So why should you be confident in me solving this enigma? For starters, I'm very passionate about it, seeing as how it keeps biting me in the ##s. I'm tech-educated as you can see on my LinkedIn profile and I've been building electronics for ages (got my first kit at the age of 7). I have access to a great hackerspace from my old university; 3D printers, laser cutters and knowledge galore! Besides that I have a pretty nice rig myself;



If you still have questions as to why this project should even come to life (for example; 'But why not use a regular kitchen timer?'), please refer to the 'but why' section below.
   

Currently I have gathered a few facts from iterative developing and testing:
The temperature of an object can be measured by the sensor used, from a safe distance to avoid melting from the heat.
The temperature of the outside of a pan is adequate to determine the inside temperature. With use of calibration this becomes 100%.
Even though the ideal diameter of a pan is at least 20cm (7.8''), smaller pans can also be used because the temperature difference between the pan and the room is so significant.


The current setup (M1) uses an Arduino in conjunction with the Seeed Infrared Sensor for rapid development. I developed a C# test application for measuring and testing:




The next iteration (M2) will have the code rewritten to C and have it transferred to a Arduino Nano 3.0 board. A 1.8-inch TFT SPI Serial 128 x 160 will be used so the link with the laptop will be gone and it will become autonomous. At this point I will begin developing the rest of the timer code and make it useable with standard input buttons. Note that if the 1.8-inch screen is deemed 'too much' for final use (don't want MONEO from distracting us from actually using it, which would require a second MONEO to remind us to use the MONEO, which in the end would result in a world filled with infinite MONEOs), a smaller screen will be used. 

When M2 is finished and properly tested, I will begin revising the needed items of the Arduino board so I can design and build a custom, cheaper board. This will be M3 and will be the completion of the hardware/software phase. Buyers of the 'Stripped MONEO' perk will receive the custom board + sensor at this stage.

NOTE: If you would like to receive a MONEO with an Arduino Nano board inside so you can easily upgrade/modify it yourself, please contact me and we'll work it out.

Now the case-designing will take place, since at this point we know the measurements of the components. A draft of the model has already been completed:


This is not the final color-scheme but just a rendering. The top part will contain the infrared sensor and should be aimed at the object of measurement. The rest is fairly obvious. The casing will be 3D printed into two parts, which allows adding the components and will then be glued together. Sanding and painting will complete the MONEO.



As noted I will not mass-produce MONEO (at this point in time). I do not yet have the required experience/knowledge, however I am teaming up with people that do so who knows what the future holds. The cool part of the current setup is however that every MONEO will be hand built by me, and only a few of them will exist. 




There are perks (something you get in return for donating in this campaign) in different sizes & shapes - look for them on the right side of this page. I don't actually make money from the MONEOs themselves, so if you feel like supporting me financially for my time & energy invested please consider donating a little extra. You can do so after selecting the perk. 
It goes without saying that there should be a t-shirt, and so there is:





They come in all sizes, genders and in black or white, so let me know your wishes when ordering  :)

Please remember to add delivery costs to the amount. You can use the DHL site to determine the amount or contact me on specifics, locations in the EU may be cheaper. The end weight isn't determined yet but it definitely won't be heavy at all; around 500 gr (1.1 lb) to 1 kg (2.2 lb).

    

But why not use a regular kitchen timer?That does sound like an obvious solution if all you want to measure is time. But since there's no exact curve as to when your water will boil (there are a bunch of variables; room temperature, number of eggs, size of eggs, amount of water - and this is just for the eggs example), this isn't a fitting solution when more factors are in play. For example: wait until the water boils, then let me know when 4 minutes have passed.But why not use an egg cooker?I did try one of those once, they did not work for me at all (picture water overflowing and eggs getting wasted). Most likely I was doing something wrong, or mine was defective, but it wasn't a pleasant experience. Besides that, it's another big appliance for only one use case.But why are you using an infrared sensor?I thought of and tried multiple angles, for example this or this or this, but they aren't very practical. You'd have to clean them, they might melt, plastic would get mixed in your food, I'd get sued for negligence - it'd be a mess. Decent infrared sensors are a bit more expensive but worth it in the end.But why can't you just stay by the kitchen?Because staring at stuff in the kitchen might be relaxing once but gets boring to do every day. I'm not talking about cooking up large meals of course, but even then MONEO can help - so you can put your focus on not cutting your fingers, or use it to set multiple timers.But why can't I buy one for 3 bucks like regular timers? Are you getting rich?I know today's industrialized outsourced industry allows for very cheap mass production, but this gem is completely built by hand and in small quantities. I'm not getting bulk discounts and 3D printing is not cheap. If you're thinking I'm getting rich over this, I'm not. The standard MONEO perk contains absolutely no profit if you account for the time and energy I have to put in making every single one of them. If you leave those factors out, they'd be about 3 to 5 bucks cheaper. That's excluding delivery & packaging costs.So if you do feel generous and want to support me, consider paying a bit more for them. But buying them in the first place is already awesome support for what I'm doing :)But why are you using an Arduino? OMG overkill!Yes quite, but it puts the rapid in rapid development while still allowing to add/remove modules (screens, buttons, sensors) on the fly without redoing schematics. Don't worry, it'll get toned down in the final product.But what if I want to build one myself?Big fan of open source, so the designs + source code will be free for all in the end. You can just wait it out and build off of that! Link it to your domotica system, make it smarter, make it interact with your smartphone, sky's not even the limit anymore - launch it into space, see how hot it is there ;)Maybe grab a shirt from the perks to keep you warm while waiting?But what if you don't make the funding goal? What will become of my money?That depends on your perk. Because every MONEO is hand built and doesn't require bulk ordering of parts, if you bought one, you'll most likely still get one. If only a few get ordered, it'll get a little rough to buy the parts since indiegogo will keep 9% when the funding goal isn't reached instead of the usual 4%. But I'll get in touch with everyone in that case to determine the best course of action.You can help avoiding this scenario by letting everyone you know hear about MONEO, be it through social media or at parties!If you ordered a t-shirt, you get one without delay. If you donated, it'll still be used for developing more projects like MONEO, and will still be appreciated just as much!Have any more 'but why's? Please let me know, I'll add them!
    

No journey is without risks, and this one is not exempt from that rule. Even though the basic science behind the concept has been proven (it'd suck if I'd built the MONEO just to find it won't work), there are still hurdles to overtake.Battery lifeThe MONEO will work on AA batteries, stored in the bottom. It will have a hardware on/off switch, and will use no power (not even 'standby' power) when off. Screen estate will be minimal; nice to use but not Ultra Mega Full HD Extra Plus. Because the hardware will be designed to have any fluff removed, it'll be efficient. Tests will be done and shared. I expect 6 to 12 months battery life, based on experience and depending on the final parts. When they are known I'll publish the math behind it.Different pans different temperature offsetsPans are not identical; some are thicker, some wider, different alloys, etc. This results in different outside temperatures related to inside temperatures. MONEO will use a default, but is also able to be calibrated. Just pour water in a pan, let MONEO know you've begun heating it, then press a button when it's boiling et voila - calibrated. This process will be fine tuned as more tests are being done.?When new issues arise, be it in my mind or during development, I'll let you know. If you got issues to report yourself, please do share!
    

Buying a perk is of course a great way to show your support (and perhaps get something out of it for yourself!). There are however other ways you can help;Promote MONEO on Facebook/Twitter/Google+/your favorite pub/your local hackerspace/friends/family/you name it! The more support the better :)

As a contributor to this campaign, you join our team. 


We are looking to help cover basic production costs like editing, graphic design, illustration, layout, and uploading fees. Any additional funds raised beyond our goal will go to help market the book in our local area and beyond! Help us reach our goal to produce A Little Thyme & A Pinch of Rhyme this fall! 
If you're unable to contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help. You can also help by getting the word out and making noise about the campaign.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Finally, an easy way to put up a Christmas tree!</strong></h3>
<p>A Christmas tree stand has two jobs: keep your tree upright and hold water for the tree to stay fresh. </p>
<p><i>Why do other Christmas tree stands make it so infuriatingly difficult get those two jobs done?</i></p>
<p>I embarked on this quest to solve the problem of terrible Christmas tree stands in 2012 after an awful experience that turned out to be the last straw. I had a few simple requirements from the Christmas tree stand I would accept: One-step tree install, a water basin that is easy to check and refill, and fast removal. And, of course, do all this while being safe and without costing a stupid amount of money.</p>
<h3><strong>Meet the Eazy Treezy</strong></h3>
<p><i>Christmas Simplified.</i></p>
<p>During my research, I asked as many people as I could about their least favorite part about Christmas. So many told me it was putting up their Christmas tree. They hated it. Many said they stopped buying real trees just to avoid that hassle. I searched everywhere for a solution and all I could find were different variations of the same concept that didn’t work or something that was pretty good, but very expensive. There had to be a better way. So I decided to develop my own; one that was affordable and did everything I needed it to…easily.  </p>
<h3><u><strong>Features</strong></u></h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy Drop-in Set-up: Lift. Drop. Done. One person, a few seconds, easy as that.   </li>
<li>Easy Check-and-Fill water basin: Simple to see the water level with plenty of room to add more water without spills.  </li>
<li>Easy Push-and-Lift Tree Removal: Push down a few jaws and lift out the tree. Bye-bye.  </li>
<li>Easy Assembly: Drop each jaw into a slot, loop the tension bands around the hooks, and you’re set to go.  </li>
<li>Safe and Stable Base: The large 22 inch diameter base makes for solid foundation to resist falling over and the base includes mounting holes to easily screw it onto a sheet of plywood for extra security. </li>
<li>Wide range of sizes: Trees from 4 feet to 10 feet tall or more (trunk diameters from 2.5"" to 5.25"") will safely fit and stay upright </li>
<li>USA Made: From the injection mold tooling to the final product, everything about the Eazy Treezy was designed and manufactured in America.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Here's how and why it works</h3>
<p><i>It’s all in the jaws.</i></p>
<p>Ditch the screws, we all know they’re awful. They take forever to adjust, you have to lay on the ground, someone else has to hold the tree, and in the end it’s never quite right. The Eazy Treezy is designed so that the weight of the tree opens the jaws effortlessly, but once in, the tension bands and angle of the sliding jaws squeeze the tree on five sides holding it straight up. And because of the large contact patch on each jaw surface, it does this without digging into and weakening the tree. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511934490/oy6z4ds0vook1zbta5lo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>What about the water?</i></p>
<p>If you want a green, fresh smelling tree for the entire Christmas season, your tree needs water…lots of it. If it’s so important, then why is it so hard to add water to tree stands? And equally as tough to even know when your water level is low? Our spout is the answer. The water basin juts out to nearly the edge of the base, down low where it’s easy to see the water level and easy to reach and refill. No guessing, no crawling, no spills, and no more dry, smelly trees.</p>
<p><i>Flexibility</i></p>
<p>The Eazy Treezy accommodates trees from 4 feet tall to 10+ feet (with trunk diameters from 2.5 inches to 5.5 inches) and it does this automatically. The jaws self-center the trunk and self-adjust to any diameter. Even crooked trunks or branch stumps aren’t a problem because each jaw slides independently. </p>
<p><i>Drop in, Lift out.</i></p>
<p>Removal is just as easy as set-up. Just push down on a few of the jaws (it only takes a few pounds of pressure) and lift the tree off the spikes and out. Less hassle, less mess.</p>
<p><i>Safety and Stability</i></p>
<p>The Eazy Treezy is designed with a wide 22 inch diameter base with three galvanized steel spikes molded into the bottom. The wide base even features additional screw holes for attachment to a piece of plywood for an even wider foundation. The steel spikes provide three points of contact, not just one, at the bottom of the tree to anchor it to the base and the galvanized coating will keep them from rusting for years on end.  </p>
<h3>The Approach – Engineered to be easy  </h3>
<p>I'm Ryan. I’m a mechanical engineer, inventor, and MBA. I’ve designed and developed theme park attractions for some of the happiest places in the world, so I obsess about design quality and attention to detail in the final product. I've launched several products for employers in the past and I'm well prepared to bring this product to market. I’ve built and tested a dozen prototypes of this product, over years of development to create a tree stand that doesn’t just work and is safe, but is the best Christmas tree stand EVER!.   </p>
<h3>Prototype vs. Production Model</h3>
<p>As you can see, the production version of the Eazy Treezy looks a little different from the functional prototype. Let me tell you what changed and why. The prototype was designed to be a functional 3D print, so some of the wall thicknesses had to be beefed up to make it strong enough. The prototype base also had to be made out of six parts (five radial segments and a water basin) in order to be printed. The production model is a single piece, injection molded base and integral water basin. It's stronger and requires less assembly. The function and the design of the proven jaw features and tension bands and how they slide in the base, remains the same. What you’ll get is a stronger, simpler, and even easier Eazy Treezy.</p>

<h3>Made in the USA</h3>
<p>The Eazy Treezy isn’t manufactured on the other side of the world. It’s made, with pride, here in the United States of America. In fact, our experienced manufacturer is only a few miles from our office in Southern California. This means better oversight and quality control and ultimately a product you can trust and be proud of.  </p>
<h3>The Right Stuff</h3>
<p>The Eazy Treezy was not just designed, but engineered to be as strong and tough as it would need to be, but as low priced as possible. I selected the materials and designed and analyzed the structure with the purpose to be the best combination of low cost, strength, durability, and stability.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Thankfully, our manufacturing partners are only a few miles away from our office. Even though we've run into some unforeseen tooling delays, work is still moving forward. Our design has been tested for function and validated for manufacturing. Although the final product is outwardly different than the prototype in the video, the functional details on the inside have remained the same, so there’s no more time in development needed. </p>

<h3>Here's the Deal</h3>
<p>Launching a product isn't easy...and it's definitely not cheap. Tooling (the largest expense), legal fees, labels, packaging, marketing expenses, first production run, the list goes on. We funded most of the above ourselves, but with this campaign we want to fund out first production run.</p>

Nous avons créé pour vous des « Offres » ou vous pouvez, soit avoir un avant goût de ce que notre service produit ou si vous résidez dans une région plus lointaine, des offres avec des produits représentant nos valeurs : par exemple notre offre de box responsable en coopération avec Hydrophil, un kit de réduction de la consomation d'eau d'Oopla ou notre offre d’un coussin issue du commerce équitable avec Umale.

Nos Valeurs
Mary & Jarvis est une entreprise se voulant moderne et est fière de représenter des valeurs responsables:

Environnementale: nous nous attachons à concevoir nos activités de manière à ne pas nuire à l'environnement, que ce soit par le biais des produits que nous utilisons, des processus que nous mettons en place ou des fournisseurs que nous sélectionnons. Faisons notre part, protégeons notre unique planète!
Sociale: nous connectons deux mondes différents à l'opposé de l'échelle sociale: Les personnes qui souhaitent améliorer leur niveau de vie et celles qui sont sur la voie du succès. toujours avec cette volonté d'offrir un service de qualité, c'est-à-dire sans compromettre son utilité fonctionnel et son sens esthétique. Mettons l'humain à sa place, au centre de l'entreprise!
Economique: nous souhaitons amener davantage de business à nos entreprises et magasins de quartier, soutenir les talents locaux et autres initiatives. Préservons la diversité de nos centres villes, qu'ils soient toujours aussi vivants et agréables!

C’est ce que nous croyons qu’une entreprise moderne devrait faire.

 What you get withyour Wayzn pre-order The team behind Wayzn, Inc.We created Wayzn because we wanted our dogs to have access to the yard when we weren't home, but didn't want the security and installation costs and headaches that come with the traditional dog door. We loved the idea of using a smartphone to control our existing sliding doors because it would give us the flexibility to go anywhere, anytime. Now we simply get notified when our dogs want to go in or out, and after scanning the area we can open the door with a single click. We quickly discovered it could be useful when at home as well and developed an automatic mode so we never have to get off the couch.Our dogs love it, and so do we!  From blueprint toproduction-ready   Shipping We ship within the US and Canada.

                1. Map View: Managers can navigate properties on the map view.2. Check-in Photo: A photo is captured and sent to the Managers as soon as the visitor gets the key or LubnBox has tampered.3. Analytics: Overtime, LUBN collects the data and visualizes them to help Managers identify opportunities for improvement. 4. Property List: All of the properties are listed with the status of the linked LubnBox, including the battery status.5. Timeline View: Both LubnBox and visitors' status can be seen in this view.  Managers can perform remote key releases from here.  The visitors' status includes Checked-in, Checked-out, Delay, Overtime, and No Show.6. Master QR Code: Admin and Managers can use the Master QR Code to release the shackle or Key Mag.  For better security, the Master QR Code is dynamic so screenshots will not work. 7. Adding Delegate Managers: Add delegate managers here so they can help the Admin coordinate the visits.8. Contacts: Keep frequent contacts here to schedule the next visit faster.9. New Visit: Schedule a new visit is so easy.  Just enter the phone numbers and the check-in/out time.  Your visitor will receive an SMS for the Trip Itinerary immediately.  Coming soon: Schedule Visits With Google Calendar / Check-in Photo Face Identification With Profile                                            Award STORYHi, I am YC, founder of LUBN.  We are enabling AI-driven property management.  It all began with my own problem.

Cars become bigger but in contrast, not their garages. It becomes a daily challenge to park the car without scratches or bumping items
Modern distance sensors at the back and front of the car are unable to differentiate close distances. Within 10 inchs (25 cm) you hear a permanent alarm or see a red signal. A four walled garage can sometimes be overloaded with garden devices, bicycles and other items, its like you’re in blind-flight-modus trying to navigate between obstacles. You’ll also need every inch to open your door without scratch it and to walk out without getting stuck somewhere

<p>As founder of AlterNation, I wanted a hosting company that could provide me a quality platform to build on. </p>
<p>I started with TMD Hosting, but was <i>constantly</i> getting complaints of slow load time on the forums. Customer service said everything was fine. Not even close!</p>
<p></p>

<p>Everything was migrated by their staff in a matter of minutes and <b>never had another complaint </b>about load time since. </p>

<p><b><u>The simple answer</u></b></p>
<p>If you have a simple website with no intention of selling any products, choose shared web hosting. </p>

<p><b>Optimal for:</b> Casual bloggers, new startups that have not launched, and personal websites with traffic up to 30,000 pageviews per month. Good place to start for most MySQL and PHP-based sites (technical jargon for certain types of websites).<br/></p>
<p>Each resident is given their own place to stay with semi-private rooms.</p>
<p>Staff monitor and maintain common areas and equipment for safety and security. </p>
<p>Some web hosting companies can get greedy by overselling the space provided, especially if they don't account for surges of traffic.</p>
<p><b>What happens if I receive too many people visiting my site at one time?</b></p>
<p>Many hosts slow down your site or suspend your account entirely. Sometimes they won't even give you the courtesy of notifying you through email.</p>
<p>In the event you experience an unforeseen traffic spike, Decibite offers traffic surge protection to boost your resources to help you manage the sudden influx.</p>

<p><b>What are potential security concerns in a shared plan? </b></p>

SimpleOur control panel is a simple interface, not bogged down with more options than you need.

We handle ALL maintenance, provide timely upgrades, and security fixes for you. No more headaches to worry about or anything to steal precious time away from you bringing your creative genius to the world.
And we take care of everything for you every step of the way, including a complementary site scrub to remove any viruses or malicious malware.

Faster load times mean better conversions. Better conversions means more money in the bank!The moment your site moves to Decibite, you’ll experience our customized NGINX infrastructure which can handle more than 4x the traffic with a fraction of the resources.How do we manage this? 
We personally optimize every site to be as fast, secure, and reliable as possible. Even our Starter VPS plan can handle loads more effectively than poorly configured dedicated servers from other hosts.


5. Optimized


Whether you are looking to optimize your website for speed or for SEO purposes, we will provide you tips, tools, and guidance directly in your admin panel.
Starting a WordPress blog? You can go live with 7 simple steps.

7. Resource Monitoring

You have the freedom to know exactly what is going on and what you are paying for. There is nothing worse than having your site down and trying to get it back up. 
If you want to prevent slow speeds or total site shut-down, you need to know about it immediately. Our monitoring tool gives you a clear picture of the resources you are using to know exactly what’s going on.
You will receive any notification when a server needs to reboot to help minimize site downtime. On top of that, you’ll receive email alerts letting as you approach your limit.
This also allows you to know you are getting great service at a very affordable price. 
This is how our prices compare to the competition (prices in CAD, meaning US customers are 20% less):


Need room to scale and handle unexpected growth? 
Not a problem. If you experience a traffic spike from the Reddit hug of death, the Product Hunt surge, or even a malicious DDoS attack, our monitoring system will alert our tech team to supply you with backup resources free of charge.

Additionally, with every purchase made, you will have a tree planted in your name.
Perhaps you don't really care about your carbon footprint. Our desire to do what is right and responsible, even if our clients may not fully be aware of the consequences.
In fact, every purchase made cleans up the carbon output of our clients and someone else not even using our service yet. We will deliver value to others, even before money has exchanged hands.
What Our Current Clients Are Saying About Us



 Mark Baker, CoFounder of BackerClub.co
Before switching to Decibite, we regularly ran into arbitrary restrictions on our accounts and email systems without warning. 
It was very frustrating to be punished for a website that was successful. Communication was poor and getting answers took way too long.
With Decibite, they personally handled our account and gave us exceptional response time and thorough help. 
The difference has been night and day.


Peter G, Founder of TheAlterNation.net
As founder of AlterNation, I wanted a hosting company that could provide me a quality platform to build on. 
I started with TMD Hosting, but was constantly getting complaints of slow load time on the forums. Customer service said everything was fine. Not even close!

I began looking for a new host and found Decibite. 
Everything was migrated by their staff in a matter of minutes and never had another complaint about load time since. 
The site is quick, stable, and if I have ideas I don't know how to implement, they figure it out for me.

Decibite is the first company I've ever felt there was a real relationship.
And if our services fail to meet your standards, you will receive 100% of your money-back within your first 100 days.




Can you tell me more about each web hosting package?





The simple answer
If you have a simple website with no intention of selling any products, choose shared web hosting. 
If you invest in your site like you do your business or sell products online, we recommend the Starter VPS. As your needs grow, so does your service and security.
Curious to learn more?
Shared hosting would be the equivalent of a hostel.

Optimal for: Casual bloggers, new startups that have not launched, and personal websites with traffic up to 30,000 pageviews per month. Good place to start for most MySQL and PHP-based sites (technical jargon for certain types of websites).
Each resident is given their own place to stay with semi-private rooms.
Staff monitor and maintain common areas and equipment for safety and security. 
Some web hosting companies can get greedy by overselling the space provided, especially if they don't account for surges of traffic.
What happens if I receive too many people visiting my site at one time?
Many hosts slow down your site or suspend your account entirely. Sometimes they won't even give you the courtesy of notifying you through email.
In the event you experience an unforeseen traffic spike, Decibite offers traffic surge protection to boost your resources to help you manage the sudden influx.
Should the traffic continue, the support team will work with you to find the best long term solution.
What are potential security concerns in a shared plan? 
Guests are prevented from visiting your ""storage"" or ""sleeping areas."" 
But malicious individuals can still attempt to con a user into allowing access to these private spaces. 
While Decibite makes every effort to keep everything secure and isolated, nothing is a real substitute for a solid wall that you'll find with a VPS.
This is why those that have the budget often upgrade to a Starter VPS.

The drawings for the design and new patent submission need to be 
completed as well as some assembly and manufacturing documents.  
Now that this complete, you can see the new design which will also 
be 
pictured on the Postcard perks that all contributors will receive.
</span>
<p></p><h3>A thought about the Early Bird R2H2O Unit perk:</h3><p>Having one of these units for emergencies, at your home or camp is a great idea but consider donating a unit to an Emergency 

Preparedness Group, EMS, Fire Dept, Church, School, or Shelter. You will have 
the opportunity at checkout to write in an alternate shipping address. Make sure you include a contact persons name and a phone number.<br/></p><p>An invoice for your Early Bird R2H2O Unit will be 

created at the time of shipment which can be used for a possible 

tax deduction if your donation is going to a non-profit.            <br/></p><p>A separate packing slip will accompany the unit to its destination.<br/></p><h3>A backwoods camping project:</h3>
This idea for a portable drinking water &amp; pumping station 
came from a personal back woods camping project with a few people 
that required using a small creek to supply our water. The water in 
the creek was tested and found to have E-coli present. The camp site 
was a mile in from the main road and always bringing in water would 
have been more unmanageable. After some thought I built a 
crude unit and created my first unit. We had a Water Purification and 
Pumping 
Station. The water was retested after using our system and no E-coli was
 present. Only then did I realize that this unit had some serious 
potential and could be used for a larger population.<br/><br/><span>  After showing it to some people, a few units were requested. Others 
I spoke to wanted one as well, then another, and another. So I built 
10 units out of a marine plastic material and decided on calling it 
R2H2O for simplicity. The design was unique and patentable.
  From feedback and my own experience, the original design is okay 
for some applications but was a little tough moving it to more remote 
locations and water sources; down trails and through the woods.
  The new design has addressed these issues and some other good ideas 
are already emerging.</span><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you can’t contribute, there is another way you can help:</p><ul>

The drawings for the design and new patent submission need to be 
completed as well as some assembly and manufacturing documents.  
Now that this complete, you can see the new design which will also 
be 
pictured on the Postcard perks that all contributors will receive.

A thought about the Early Bird R2H2O Unit perk:Having one of these units for emergencies, at your home or camp is a great idea but consider donating a unit to an Emergency 

Preparedness Group, EMS, Fire Dept, Church, School, or Shelter. You will have 
the opportunity at checkout to write in an alternate shipping address. Make sure you include a contact persons name and a phone number.An invoice for your Early Bird R2H2O Unit will be 

created at the time of shipment which can be used for a possible 

tax deduction if your donation is going to a non-profit.            A separate packing slip will accompany the unit to its destination.A backwoods camping project:
This idea for a portable drinking water & pumping station 
came from a personal back woods camping project with a few people 
that required using a small creek to supply our water. The water in 
the creek was tested and found to have E-coli present. The camp site 
was a mile in from the main road and always bringing in water would 
have been more unmanageable. After some thought I built a 
crude unit and created my first unit. We had a Water Purification and 
Pumping 
Station. The water was retested after using our system and no E-coli was
 present. Only then did I realize that this unit had some serious 
potential and could be used for a larger population.  After showing it to some people, a few units were requested. Others 
I spoke to wanted one as well, then another, and another. So I built 
10 units out of a marine plastic material and decided on calling it 
R2H2O for simplicity. The design was unique and patentable.
  From feedback and my own experience, the original design is okay 
for some applications but was a little tough moving it to more remote 
locations and water sources; down trails and through the woods.
  The new design has addressed these issues and some other good ideas 
are already emerging.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can’t contribute, there is another way you can help:

  Hello and thanks for looking.

The Impact


The Firearm Magazine Safety Lock completely renders a firearm inoperable, it cannot be loaded or fired.
Our firearm safety device is completely designed in the United States, and that is where it will be manufactured.
Unintentional shootings cause 20 percent of all firearm-related
deaths among children ages 14 and under.
There are currently over 6,000,000 pistols in circulation.  From 1998 through 2010, there were nearly 30,000,000 applications submitted for pistol ownership.  Needless to say, the need for an excellent firearm lock exists.
Our lock is virtually impossible to 
overcome without damaging the firearm, there isn't another lock 
available that can make that claim.  
If YOUR child was at another house, wouldn't you feel better knowing that their firearms were unusable?




What We Need & What You Get
  For our locks to go into production, they need to be California Department of Justice (DOJ) approved.  The money we are asking for will help start the ball rolling.  
  We need to 3D scan existing firearms to make our lock fit as many manufacturers as possible.  We can then finalize the design and build the first parts needed to attain DOJ approval. That's about it.  Once DOJ has approved it, we will be able to make sales and fill orders.

<p>Blankets for the Homeless: Blankets for the Homeless (VA) was started by Mariah Smith when she was just 15 years old. Now, 6 years later, she has given out 110,000 blankets and lunches to the homeless community. She lives this cause, and we couldn't think of anyone more fit to help us all Give a Tuck. </p>
<p>Northern Children's Services: Northern Children's Services (PHL) provides residential and behavioral health services for children from 8-21 years old. At the end of the day, we all would benefit from some comfort. That goes even more for these kids. Send some their way by adding five dollars to your pledge to Give a Tuck. </p>
<p>The Bowery Mission: The Bowery Mission (NYC) has been providing food, medical services and employment assistance to homeless men women and children since 1879. They astoundingly shelter some 60,000 people in New York City on a given night, and are always in need of assistance. </p>
<p>Khloe Kares: Early on in this project, there was a lot of sewing going on and often the TV would be playing aimlessly in the background. One day, I overheard people talking about sewing beautiful bags and filling them with toiletries for the homeless, and looked on the TV to see 8-year-old Khloe Thompson. She said that walking to school, she would pass by dozens of people struggling to get by, and asked her mom what they could do to help. Since then, Khloe, her mom Alisha, and her Grandma have handed out dozens of Kare bags and organized Toy Drives for the sake of a better community. She's 8, folks. What was I doing at 8 years old??? Sneaking Mortal Kombat games in when my parents weren't watching and eating Mac n' Cheese...that's what. This girl inspired us from the beginning to want to do more....and hopefully she'll be president some day. </p>

<p>This product is on here because we absolutely love it, and we think you all will too. With our first prototype we realized how many of our discomforts the Tuck addressed, and how many more we didn't even think about. We are so thrilled with how far it has come. The blanket is such an integral part of our every day lives, so it is only fitting that it endures a long overdue redesign. With this product it seems every day we figure out a fun new way to use it, and we are SO excited to see how this idea evolves with the Indiegogo community.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have sent samples back and forth with the same dedicated manufacturer since our third prototype was created back in March, and the experience has been incredible thus far. Quality is wonderful, the shipping is fast and reliable, and the overall experience from our end has been beyond our wildest expectations.</p>
<p>While production and fulfillment on a larger scale can mean larger problems, we have been assured that our manufacturing team is up to the task, and we can promise you that they haven't led us astray. We have also created different fulfillment plans based on the campaign success, so that we aren't thrown off balance by any variation in numbers.</p>
<p>The invention is relatively simple on the manufacturing end. At PocketChange we seek simple, ""why didn't I think of that"" innovation so that we can develop amazing products without production inefficiency. We don't need molds or complicated tech, and all of our components have been sourced long before pressing the ""Launch"" button.</p>
<p>As life teaches us all, you don't truly know what risks and challenges await until they are smacking you in the face. That being said, we are feeling well prepared for the task at hand and promise to keep you updated every step of the way.</p>
<p>This is a comfort product and I want you, as an integral part of this campaign, to feel totally comfortable. So shoot us a message or post a comment and we'll try to get back to you as soon as we see it! We really Give a Tuck about what you have to say.</p>
</div></div>","Tuck is dozens of other comfort products in one simple, fluffy package, and it does way too much to be called a ""blanket.""
In pocket-blanket mode...it's ideal for snuggles, binge marathons, and foot tucking. 
 
In pillow mode...it's perfect for daytime naps, storage, and on-the-go comfort. 

And in cloak mode - it has your back through work-filled mornings, game-filled nights, and those times when your partner decides it is you who gets up for snacks.

Dimensions: In Pillow Mode - 18.5in x 15in 
In Blanket Mode - 60in x 70in


 



The Patent-Pending tri-pocket design of Tuck makes it so there are so many different ways to use it. 
 
You can stick your feet in one of the safe-pockets to keep them warm or keep your snuggle partner from pulling it away...like usual.

You can fold it up into Pillow-Mode and use it as a combination pillow/sleep mask for a daytime nap, comfy car ride, or relaxing flight. 

Or you can flip it upside down and put your hands through the pouches. The side openings and added thumbholes give you extra freedom when wearing the Tuck, and it has a big cozy hood for some comfy solitude. 
No matter how you use it...Tuck is the perfect uniform for binge sessions, lazy days, and movie marathons. ""Netflix and Chill"" is much warmer with a pocket to play footsie!

The Tuck is designed to adapt to your comfort...so you can use it however makes you comfortable! Here our some of our favorite starter poses to get you started, and show you how we've used the Tuck so far.




Non-Biological Reason: It is the most versatile comfort object ever invented, and it's extremely comfortable.
Biological Reason: Studies show that the majority of people are very particular about their feet when they sleep, and that addressing their preference leads to better sleep quality. This is because your body temperature plays a key role in both falling and staying asleep, and your feet are an important variable there.

You can do it in a box...you can do it with a fox!
Ok but seriously, we have taken the Tuck everywhere with us, and it has proven time and time again how adaptable it is.

You can sleep soundly in typically uncomfortable places like cars and ever-shrinking plane seats. 

You can wear the Tuck like a cloak when you want to use your hands to play games or tell Netflix that you are still watching.

You can pick-a-pocket and share the Tuck for your next movie night or lazy day. You can even fit three sets of feet in one Tuck if you want to have a big cuddle puddle...trust us, we know.
The Tuck adapts to fit you. And we can't wait to see all the ways you use it that we haven't even thought of.

Mary has numerous sensors that do the monitoring for you and keep your plant in optimal condition.Through artificial intelligence, Mary learns how to produce a larger harvest in less time each time you grow. Modern city lights disturb plants’ growth, affecting root system and CO2 collection. Plants that are entering flowering or fruition stage require better day/night cycles. Mary uses electrochromic glass so that you can turn the glass clear to show off your plant during the day, and opaque during dark times to allow your plant to sleep peacefully. Proper day and night, just how nature intended. Nearly all indoor gardens provide top down lighting. However, if your plant has multiple layers or branches, the bottom will never get enough light to grow healthily. That’s why we designed Hololights: a multi-directional surround lighting system that gives abundant light to every surface of your plant. In addition to the light panel on top, there is an 80 cm tall LED panel on the internal back, and another assisting panel in the internal front.In partnership with our light manufacturer we have created a sunlight-mimicking LED spectrum. The result is a more efficient lighting system that provides proper nourishment to promote healthy growth.  We think lights are not just to give plants life, but your living room as well. That’s why Mary has external lights that have over 16 million colour options which you can easily set in the app. Customize the look of your Mary to suit your environment.  There’s also a diffused night light on the back of the device, giving you a beautifully smooth glow in the dark. In the design process, we made sure everything was realistic to produce and would pass safety and durability tests. Therefore, everything you saw in the video (including the “arrow” lights from the first few seconds) came from our working prototype and iOS app.Our team come from hardware startup and manufacturing backgrounds. Having a longtime relationship with one of the largest manufacturers in China, we ensure Mary is of quality and durability. Each part of the system will go through rigorous stress tests, such as high humidity, low/high temperature, drop, fire retardancy. Please support us and spread the word! A few clicks would make a huge difference for us. By doing that, you are not only trying out a new lifestyle, you are also one of the pioneers in independence from industrialized food production, and in self sufficiency in food.And YOU ARE AWESOME for making it to the end!",27.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><span><strong>My Vision</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>I am Tom Beck, the CEO of SHEC Energy Corporation.</span></p>
<p><span>My vision for the future is:</span></p>
<p><span>1) A clean and sustainable renwable energy future that is cost affective</span></p>
<p><span>2) Transition to electric and hybrid electric vehicles to reduce the requirement of fossil fuels</span></p>
<p><span>3) Reduction of green house gases</span></p>
<p><span>4) Abundant renewable energy to stop proliferation of nuclear materials that can be used to make nuclear weapons</span></p>
<h2><span><strong>An Example for the World</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span><strong>North America</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>In North America, the United States is heavily dependent on fossil fuels, much of which it imports from areas of the world that are subject to disruption from countries that are politically hostile to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span>North America can become energy independent with the broad adoption of SHEC Energy's low cost 24/7 base-load solar power.  This would require the adoption of electric vehicles on a large scale as well.  </span></p>
<p><span>Interestingly enough, electric vehicles require less power than it costs to make gasoline to operate a gas car.  This means we would not require a large build-out of new power infrastructure, but instead SHEC Energy's technology is well suited to retrofitting existing fossil fuel and nuclear steam power plants.  This solution means the investments in existing power generation infrastructure is preserved while allowing the much faster deployment of renewable power using SHEC Energy's technology. </span></p>
<p><span>Even If the Unites States eliminates the importation of overseas oil and gas, it will still be required for operating trucks, aircraft and ships. The reduced usage can be totally supplied by Canada, who's reserves are larger than Saudi Arabia.</span></p>
<p><span>Reciprocally, The United States has better solar conditions than Canada and therefore could be a net exporter of solar energy to Canada.  This offers a balance of energy trade to North America closest neighbors.</span></p>
<h3><span><strong>Europe</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>Likewise, Europe and other geographically close trading counties can adopt the same principle. North Africa for example is an ideal location for solar power generation in close proximity to Europe.</span></p>
<h3><span><strong>Iran</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>Iran would not have to build a nuclear capability and could rely upon the abundance of solar energy available in the region.  There would be no excuse to go nuclear.</span></p>
<p><span>Nuclear is not an option.  After the useful life of a nuclear power plant of about 30 years, it has to be decommissioned at about the same cost it took to build it.  Then there is the radioactive waste issue that will be around for 250,000 years.  Who will pay for that?  I am sure it is not the power utilities and nuclear companies that will long have gone out of business, but the legacy of our offspring.  How selfish for this generation to live at the expense of generations to come.  It is no longer necessary with SHEC Energy's technology.</span></p>
<h3><span><strong>Vision Summary</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>Humanity can go two ways.</span></p>
<p><span>1) A clean sustainable energy future or</span></p>
<p><span>2) A scorched Earth policy.</span></p>
<p><span>We have the technology to achieve vision 1.</span></p>
<h2><span><strong>Planetary Emergency</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>There is a Planetary Emergency as the polar icecap is melting at an accelerated rate and will be gone in 8 years. There is fear that methane under the icecap will be released and greatly accelerate global warming. (see the news article on <a href=""http://www.shecenergy.com/donate"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><strong>www.shecenergy.com/donate</strong></span></a> )</span></p>
<p><span>When I started this company 16 years ago, my motivation was clean air, as air pollution in large cities impacted my health.  Now we are faced with a global emergency with the polar ice cap predicted to melt before 2020.  This could have dire consequences to humanity.  This may cause the release of methane trapped in the permafrost to be released. Methane is 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.  The polar ice cap is also reflective and redirects sunlight back out into space. With that gone, the oceans could absorb more heat and cause the further acceleration of global warming to the point of no recovery.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Human settlement, agricultural food production and fisheries have been established based on long term weather patterns spanning centuries.  These can suddenly change, dramatically affecting climate and food production.</span></span></p>
<p><span>I feel a very urgent need to as quickly as possible transition off of polluting energy sources.  There is a huge disconnect with the publics unawareness of this emergency. I hope with this campaign to broaden the publics awareness, whether they contribute or not to our renewable energy initiative to get society off of polluting energy sources.</span></p>
<h2><span><strong>SHEC Energy’s Technology</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>SHEC Energy Corporation has developed a Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) and thermal energy storage technology that can produce power 24 hours a day from sunlight while doing so at low cost (grid parity) that can compete against polluting fossil and nuclear power. Grid parity means government subsidies are no longer required to make solar projects economically viable as other solar technologies require.</span></p>
<p><span>The following YouTube video describes how the technology works:</span></p>
<p><span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lKGS-XZjVQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lKGS-XZjVQ</a></span></p>
<p><span>Although traditional solar panels that produce electricity from the sun are becoming more economical, they only produce power when the sun shines.  Batteries can be used for backup. 24 hour a day base-load solar power plants using batteries for storage become prohibitively expensive.  This is not the case with Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants.  This is because you have to store electricity for solar panels which is very expensive.  For CSP plants, you do not store electricity, but heat instead.  This is very economical.  </span></p>
<p><span>The other consideration not taken into account is the intermittency of day-light only power plants.  A conventional power plant must be on hot standby with its turbine spinning to fill in the energy gaps that exist in solar power plants without energy storage.  This requires a doubling of infrastructure, something that is not needed in a properly designed CSP plant.  </span></p>
<p>A good example of this is a study that was conducted of the effectiveness of Norway’s wind farm with 6,000 wind turbines. it was supposed to supply the country with 19% of its power.  In actuality in only provided 3% due to the conventional power plants having to spin near capacity to fill in the power dips from the wind.  The same goes for solar.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that society in general consumes 60% of power when the sun is not shining.  SHEC Energy's 24/7 base-load power plants can deliver this at far less cost than solar panels with battery storage and at a cost close to, or at grid parity.</p>
<p>SHEC Energy’s technology innovations include a solar concentrator that reduces cost by about 75% over convention technologies and a thermal energy system that reduces cost by about 50%.</p>
<h2> <strong>Why this is Important</strong>
</h2>
<p>This campaign is important to us because it will allow us to complete a full scale demonstration model of our technology, not only to economically collect solar energy, but to store it as well for 24 hour power generation. (note: further funds will be required to establish the energy storage portion of our proposed pilot plant)  This is very important for the world for energy independence and for a clean and renewable energy future and to reverse global warming.</p>
<p><span>We have a small group of investors who have supported our efforts for the last 16 years and now have to expand our capital base to achieve our goals.  Our operating budget has been very low compared to other organizations.  We have out-developed major organizations and even national government laboratories.  We need just $750,000 to complete our demonstration plant.  We have prospective customers all over the world that would like to see the demonstration plant before committing to orders.  This is a game changing technology that can move us off of polluting fossil and nuclear fuels to a clean and sustainable energy future and make a big impact in reversing global warming.</span></p>
<p><span>We are legitimate and as evidence of that have been awarded and received a grant of $200,000 from The Canadian Industrial Research Assistance Program. We were awarded a grant for $2 million from Sustainable Development Technology Canada but due to being unable to provide the 2 to 1 matching funds required to receive the grant, had to give up the funds. We have also been awarded a 25 million Euro grant from a government in Germany, but again require matching funds from the private sector to obtain funds from the grant. In the process of being awarded these significant grants, a team is sent out to review our technology and operations in depth. The governments issuing these grants are responsible for the public purse and want to make sure public funds are invested wisely. Governments however will not flip the entire bill and require participation from the private sector.  The fact that we had received these grant awards shows the credibility of our technology. </span></p>
<p><span>We have further had our technology evaluated by a government lab with a positive report.  We have further been sponsored by both the Canadian Government and the US Department of Energy on international trade missions.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We require $750,000 to complete a demonstration plant.  Funds will be used to purchase material and pay for personnel to complete the construction of the pilot plant. </p>
<p>We are the only company in the world as far as we know that will be able to produce what is called Base-Load solar power in a price range of 6.5 to 10 cents per kWh.  Base-Load means power 24 hours a day.  This is very important since society consumes 60% of their power when the sun is not shining.  This is a price that will not require government subsidies to implement and will greatly help the economy by eliminating the costs associated with the import and defense of foreign oil. This is a technology that can save trillions of dollars of tax payer money over time in the importation and defense of limited supplies of oil and gas.  In contrast there is enough solar energy hitting the planet to power society 8,000 times over.</p>
<p>Funds will be applied to the project as we go.  If we do not reach our goal, we are seeking other funding sources in parallel to help us achieve this goal.</p>
<p>We will issue you a Hero of the Planet certificate and other items based on donation levels in recognition of your contribution in helping us change the energy landscape of the future from polluting and limited energy sources to a clean and sustainable energy future.  What you really get in return is contributing to humanities clean energy future, and that is good for everyone including our children and grandchildren.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>We the people</strong> have the power to change the future to a bright, clean, sustainable and energy self sufficient future.</p>
<p><span>Global climate change is happening at a far faster rate than previously predicted. The real threat of war in the Middle east could cause global energy disruption and topple world economies. The work we are doing at SHEC is of vital importance to the future of the world in providing a clean energy source and for energy independence and energy security of the world.</span></p>
<p>The reason this resource has had limited entry into the market is because it has traditionally been very expensive, requiring subsidies and does not work when the sun does not shine.  We have now, after 16 long years of development with the singular focus of producing a 24 hour base-load solution to be low cost, have now achieved that goal.  We have built numerous prototypes and field tested much of the technology with great success.  These last developments bring our cost down to the point of being competitive with fossil fuels.  This was our mandate. </p>
<p>In fact, out numerical models for the new technology show that in mass production, we could achieve a solar concentrator cost of $35 per square meter (square yard).  That is half the cost of that the Department of Energy (DOE) has targeted for 2020.  Not only have we halved the cost, but have done so 8 years ahead of the DOE target date.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Nalani, along with my husband Colin and our daughters, Inoa and Caoimhe, we have become a surrogate family to our nanny Josie (Diosyvel G. Morales). Josie was there for us when Caoimhe was born, helps us with our daughters and keeping everything in perfect working order.  </p>
<p>Josie has spent the past 10 years working diligently away from her three children to provide them with schooling, housing and a life she couldn't provide for them if she were working in the Philippines. One of her biggest joys was finally finishing her house. It was put up in pieces over those four years and she had just had the last tiles put down in the small two room house. Then <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/14/world/asia/philippines-earthquake/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">disaster struck</a> and her house as well as the houses of all of her family were swept away. Thankfully, no one was injured, but her house was destroyed and now her children and other family members are living and sleeping outdoors until she can come up with a plan for rebuilding. Every little bit will help her get her family's safety and dreams back on track!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

I'm Nalani, along with my husband Colin and our daughters, Inoa and Caoimhe, we have become a surrogate family to our nanny Josie (Diosyvel G. Morales). Josie was there for us when Caoimhe was born, helps us with our daughters and keeping everything in perfect working order.  
Josie has spent the past 10 years working diligently away from her three children to provide them with schooling, housing and a life she couldn't provide for them if she were working in the Philippines. One of her biggest joys was finally finishing her house. It was put up in pieces over those four years and she had just had the last tiles put down in the small two room house. Then disaster struck and her house as well as the houses of all of her family were swept away. Thankfully, no one was injured, but her house was destroyed and now her children and other family members are living and sleeping outdoors until she can come up with a plan for rebuilding. Every little bit will help her get her family's safety and dreams back on track!


What We Need & What You Get
All of the funds will go to Josie to rebuild her house. These funds will help her build the first room of the house for her children and extended family to live in. Anything else will help in adding the second room and kitchen.
The perks of funding are a handwritten thank you note from Josie and our family as well as email updates and pictures of the progress of the house build.
If we don't reach our goal all of the money will still go to Josie to help her get started in building her new house.


The Impact
This will have a huge transformative impact on Josie, help her see what amazing things people can do and take a lot of the weight off of her shoulders as a mother living far away from her children.

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>This is where you come in -</p>
<p><br/>We are attempting to raise $250,000 to begin building 7 of these cabins at the Living Well Community in Franklinville NC - (see <a href=""http://www.walksoftlyontheearth.com/our-green-communities/the-living-well-community.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.walksoftlyontheearth.com/our-green-communities/the-living-well-community.aspx</a> ) Cost includes the price of the land lots to begin building.</p>
<p>Each unit costs about $30,000 to build. Lots are going to be $40,000 unless we can buy 2 and then it will be $30,000 per lot. We currently have 10,000 to put into this project - we need $250,000 to make it work.</p>
<p><br/>Once the first 7 are built, which should take less than 6 months. We will move on the next 7 as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>This project is not going to happen without your help! If we fall short of the total goal, thats ok! we can get started on this project for as low as 70,000 (the first dome) although this is not very efficient, we really wanna see these things grow and grow and spread across the US in various shapes and sizes until we can replace costly traditional housing with all of its costly upkeep and energy in-efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
The Living Well Community is the first of many projects (we hope!) and will begin to show people that there is a better way to live, by being more efficient with our designs and learning to appreciate and respect nature, we can be an example to other communities, and inspire people to start taking care of the world, as she takes care of us.</div>

Guess what? It’s your lucky day! Let us introduce: <b>Onecut</b>.<br/><br/>Onecut is the world’s first truly universal stand-alone tool that provides you with the miter angle for cutting crown molding. It's patented, saves you time and cuts costs. Once you try it – you can’t be without it.</p><div data-id=""15137483""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2YwBtdNns9zrTa/source.gif"" src=""""/> <figcaption>Onecut - The patented technology</figcaption></figure></div><h3> </h3><h3>What's in it for me?</h3><ul>
<li>Efficiently measures and provides you with the correct angle for cutting. </li>
<li>Simple design that enables you to be more productive. </li>
<li>Stores correct angle reliably, which minimizes the risk of having to take new measurements.</li>
<li>Keeps accurate angle even if the saw blade is put close to the CA-block.</li>
<li>Reduces risk of cutting at the wrong angle, which saves you both time and money.</li>
<li>Ensures a reliable result and minimizes the risk of damages because of its robust construction. </li>
</ul><div data-href=""https://youtu.be/y82xldyrTk0""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""344"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/y82xldyrTk0?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=transparent"" width=""612""></iframe></div></div><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>Onecut helps you find the miter angle for cutting crown molding, see Figure 1. It provides and stores the miter angle, which is the corner angle, divided in half. The cutting angle block (CA-block), shown in Figure 1 with the white arrow, provides this miter angle. The product can then, without adjustments or calculations, be directly transferred onto the cutting device. The user puts Onecut on the cutting device and adjusts the saw blade after the CA-block, which can be seen in Figure 2.</p><div data-id=""15196868""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1487183984/sogyvruh2vtnehe809n8.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h3> </h3><h3>Who’s it for?</h3><p>It’s for anyone, both amateurs and professionals, who’s looking for a seamless way to take on crown molding installations, along with other molding projects such as base molding, all kinds of frames and many other woodwork projects.</p><p>You can even adjust it to suit your needs. It makes no difference whether it’s an outer angle or an inner angle you have to measure. In addition you can keep Onecut up against the saw for a precise cut. It will save you time and money through less scrap and guesswork. No calculations and no complicated settings of the saw. No more trial and error and no more ugly gaps in crown molding joints.

Peter has a passion for quality woodwork and back in the 80’s (true story) he decided to build his own house in Jokkmokk, in the north of Sweden. It all went really well but when he was to put base molding and crown molding around the house (as the finishing touch) he had problems finding a tool that could provide him with the correct miter angle.</p><p>He identified a gap on the market and thought about this problem year after year. At last, five years ago now, through his vision to find a way to make all the hard work with crown molding much easier he came up with the idea to Onecut.</p><p>From that moment the tool has evolved as a prototype. Peter has teamed up with the rest of us and together we’ve been putting our hearts and souls into perfecting Onecut´s form and function. Now we have a international patent and are ready to launch. Onecut is designed to find and store the correct angle for cutting and it does this as a stand-alone product. It has a simple design, which allows both DIY amateur and professional carpenters to use it.</p><div data-id=""15308755""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Prototype evolution"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1487183987/htfeesvilseuy2hbytum.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption>Prototype evolution</figcaption></figure></div><h3> </h3><h3><b>The team</b></h3><div data-id=""15147036""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1487183987/nkt06zyjon8kvwsqpdkp.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h3>Why InDemand?</h3><p>Truth be told, we’ve been blown away by the Indiegogo community´s incredible support we’ve seen on other projects. And we simply can’t do this without your support. Starting manufacturing is a huge deal that costs a lot of money. So please help us on our mission to find a way to make crown molding installations easier, cheaper and less time consuming.

ABS plastic has many good qualities such as low weight, good strength and dimensional stability. The material is characterized by good impact strength, surface hardness and surface finish. It’s recyclable, resistant to acids, alkaline solutions, alcohol, grease, oil, salt solutions and saturated hydrocarbons.</p><p>ABS stands for “Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene”. The acrylonitrile improves strength, chemical resistance and provides less risk of stress cracking compared to polystyrene (PS). The impact strength is very good even at lower temperatures.

Guess what? It’s your lucky day! Let us introduce: Onecut.Onecut is the world’s first truly universal stand-alone tool that provides you with the miter angle for cutting crown molding. It's patented, saves you time and cuts costs. Once you try it – you can’t be without it. Onecut - The patented technology What's in it for me?
Efficiently measures and provides you with the correct angle for cutting. 
Simple design that enables you to be more productive. 
Stores correct angle reliably, which minimizes the risk of having to take new measurements.
Keeps accurate angle even if the saw blade is put close to the CA-block.
Reduces risk of cutting at the wrong angle, which saves you both time and money.
Ensures a reliable result and minimizes the risk of damages because of its robust construction. 
How does it work?Onecut helps you find the miter angle for cutting crown molding, see Figure 1. It provides and stores the miter angle, which is the corner angle, divided in half. The cutting angle block (CA-block), shown in Figure 1 with the white arrow, provides this miter angle. The product can then, without adjustments or calculations, be directly transferred onto the cutting device. The user puts Onecut on the cutting device and adjusts the saw blade after the CA-block, which can be seen in Figure 2. Who’s it for?It’s for anyone, both amateurs and professionals, who’s looking for a seamless way to take on crown molding installations, along with other molding projects such as base molding, all kinds of frames and many other woodwork projects.You can even adjust it to suit your needs. It makes no difference whether it’s an outer angle or an inner angle you have to measure. In addition you can keep Onecut up against the saw for a precise cut. It will save you time and money through less scrap and guesswork. No calculations and no complicated settings of the saw. No more trial and error and no more ugly gaps in crown molding joints. Yay! What are others saying about Onecut?""The time saving is the biggest advantage of Onecut. It could replace the machinist square and be carried in your dungarees instead!"" - Rickard Eriksson, CEO of Vittjärvshus.Peter building a patio to test our first prototype  What saw can I use with Onecut?You can use Onecut with a professional or regular saw. BackgroundThe initial idea behind Onecut was originated by the Swedish inventor and amateur carpenter Peter Vallerström. Peter has a passion for quality woodwork and back in the 80’s (true story) he decided to build his own house in Jokkmokk, in the north of Sweden. It all went really well but when he was to put base molding and crown molding around the house (as the finishing touch) he had problems finding a tool that could provide him with the correct miter angle.He identified a gap on the market and thought about this problem year after year. At last, five years ago now, through his vision to find a way to make all the hard work with crown molding much easier he came up with the idea to Onecut.From that moment the tool has evolved as a prototype. Peter has teamed up with the rest of us and together we’ve been putting our hearts and souls into perfecting Onecut´s form and function. Now we have a international patent and are ready to launch. Onecut is designed to find and store the correct angle for cutting and it does this as a stand-alone product. It has a simple design, which allows both DIY amateur and professional carpenters to use it.Prototype evolution The teamWhy InDemand?Truth be told, we’ve been blown away by the Indiegogo community´s incredible support we’ve seen on other projects. And we simply can’t do this without your support. Starting manufacturing is a huge deal that costs a lot of money. So please help us on our mission to find a way to make crown molding installations easier, cheaper and less time consuming. We can’t launch this new and unique product without you. MaterialOnecut will be made of a ABS plastic that withstand rough environments (plus that it will be able to be folded into a protecting shell). ABS plastic has many good qualities such as low weight, good strength and dimensional stability. The material is characterized by good impact strength, surface hardness and surface finish. It’s recyclable, resistant to acids, alkaline solutions, alcohol, grease, oil, salt solutions and saturated hydrocarbons.ABS stands for “Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene”. The acrylonitrile improves strength, chemical resistance and provides less risk of stress cracking compared to polystyrene (PS). The impact strength is very good even at lower temperatures. We will also add a UV stabilizer to improve Onecut´s UV resistance. We ran over our prototype with a car to test the strength and it didn't break! ABS plastic FTW! SpecificationsWhat's next?We want you to have your Onecut as soon as possible. Here’s our plan to achieve that:January/February: Make lots of new Kickstarter/Indiegogo friends, execute manufacturing agreements/standards.March/April: Finalize the engineering and prototype iterations and place the tooling orders.May: Tooling build-out and procurement of raw materials and components.June: Part qualification and pre-production builds, pilot production, quality assurance and product validation.July/Aug: Begin manufacturing for the injection molded and blow-molded parts.

Nothing too serious, pretty common in Fall, but a week later my ear was aching pretty badly. I was looked at by the doctors, and they said the reason was the Moraxella Catarrhails bacteria, which often resides on dishes. This was the final drop. I’ve long been fed up with these pieces of foam - they keep tearing up, are hard to clean, take a while to dry. It’s really uncomfortable when there’s dirt in your kitchen, more so when this “dirt” can give you an infection.</p><p>I’ve decided to use rags instead - they’re dense, are quicker to dry, and more convenient. But the regular cloth didn’t fit - it was bad at dishwashing, and wasn’t much better at self-cleaning than sponges were.</p><p>I needed a special kind of rag, with piles and antiseptic and ecological material.

Replace them with Kali - the antibacterial dishcloth that contains bamboo kun - it’ll make it much easier to keep your house clean! The Kali absorbs a lot of liquid, washes any surfaces to perfection, and can be easily self-washed under a running tap. Want to make caring after your home easy and comfortable? The Kali is your choice!We’re using sponges to keep our dishes and the area around kitchen sink clean… But in doing so, we’re turning these sponges into dirtiest objects in our homes - a paradox! It’s a fact long proven by the British scientists, and it’s often discussed in the media:Yes, when a sponge is visibly dirty and starts to emit foul odor, we throw it out, but does it solve the problem? Not at all - bacteria infest the sponge since day 1, and are not affected by dishwashing liquids. Some can even survive microwaves:Get rid of the bacteria breeding ground in your own kitchen, switch your sponge for The Kali!The Kali is a special antibacterial dishcloth. Thanks to its unique bristles, it cleans any surface perfectly…...and is easily self-cleaned with tap waterThe Kali will help you wash your dishes easily, and keep your kitchen clean!The Kali is made of super-porous material - bamboo fiber, which absorbs three times more liquid than ordinary cottonThe bamboo fibers which compose The Kali’s material contain natural antiseptic - the bamboo kun. This substance destroys up to 70% of bacteria and prevents them from multiplyingThe Kali allows you to keep any surface clean, not only dishes - from tabletops and shelves to home appliances. The Kali removes all stains, leaving no traces or stains.Wear-resistant, sturdy and dense, The Kali will serve you 20-30 times longer than ordinary sponges, fully keeping its properties along the way. Ultimately, when you consider its service time, The Kali turns out to be cheaper than the obsolete solutionsHow I came up with The Kali?It all started pretty simple - I caught a cold. Nothing too serious, pretty common in Fall, but a week later my ear was aching pretty badly. I was looked at by the doctors, and they said the reason was the Moraxella Catarrhails bacteria, which often resides on dishes. This was the final drop. I’ve long been fed up with these pieces of foam - they keep tearing up, are hard to clean, take a while to dry. It’s really uncomfortable when there’s dirt in your kitchen, more so when this “dirt” can give you an infection.I’ve decided to use rags instead - they’re dense, are quicker to dry, and more convenient. But the regular cloth didn’t fit - it was bad at dishwashing, and wasn’t much better at self-cleaning than sponges were.I needed a special kind of rag, with piles and antiseptic and ecological material. Half a year of research later and it became clear - I needed a dishcloth out of bamboo fiber.In early 2019 it was clear to me that such dishcloth could potentially replace sponges entirely, ridding us of these concentrations of dirt. I traveled to China to visit a factory that could fulfill an order based on my project. The prototype had proved itself perfect - the dishcloth is amazing at its job and washes all surfaces easily and effectively while serving for a long time.So here I am, offering The Kali to you. Let’s get rid of bacteria!",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

</ul></div>","Bagel is the only tape measure you will ever need. With three different measuring modes, Bagel lets you measure just about anything.It can also save measurements, record voice memos, and send data to its mobile app, where you can easily organize and analyze your measurements. That’s why we call Bagel a smart tape measure.한국어　We all measure size in our daily lives. Whether it’s for a DIY home improvement project or for measuring body size, everyone uses a tape measure. Despite the various uses for a tape measure, the way we measure size has remained the same for more than a century. It’s about time that we stop trying so hard to read tiny numbers and markings on tape measures.　It's time to innovate the way we measure size.       Bagel is easy to use. Select one mode from three different measuring modes, take a measurement, then click the save button to save your data.You can also choose to add a voice memo that describes what you measured. As soon as you connect Bagel to its mobile app, this voice recording will be automatically converted into text and tagged to your measurement. 　How to use Bagel in 4 steps   　You can use Bagel's string mode to measure length like you would with a traditional tape measure. Its flexible yet strong string allows you to easily measure curved objects and surfaces, various body types, and- needless to say- flat surfaces. Bagel's string mode can measure up to about 10 feet (3 meters).　 How string mode works  　Wheel mode is great when you don’t have both hands available to measure length or distance. Just switch to Bagel's wheel mode and roll its wheel. Wheel mode is perfect for measuring distance on curved surfaces and can measure up to about 33 feet (10 meters).　　How wheel mode works  　When you want to measure the distance to areas that are far away or hard to reach, use Bagel’s remote mode. Simply point the ultrasonic sensor at objects, walls, or ceilings and Bagel will tell you how far away they are. The remote mode automatically activates a laser that points at your target spot to indicate where you are measuring. You can measure up to 16 feet 4 inches (5 meters) in remote mode.　　How remote mode works   　 　Saving Data & Voice MemosAfter taking your measurement, save the data with just a click of a button. You can also choose to record a voice memo that describes what you just measured. Never experience the hassle of going back and forth between your notepad and tape measure! Bluetooth ConnectivityWe wouldn’t call Bagel smart if that was all. You can connect Bagel to your smartphone via Bluetooth and transfer all of your measurements to Bagel’s mobile app.　Mobile AppUse Bagel’s app and never lose measurements again. You can browse through your measurements, all of which are tagged with a voice memo. Additionally, take advantage of the app's ability to export your data as CSV to use on your computer.If you want to track your body size, simply open up a graph that will display how your measurements have changed over time. Both iOS and Android versions of the mobile app will be available for free.　Internal MemoryYou don't have to connect Bagel to your smartphone every time you want to take a look at past measurements. Bagel has internal memory that can save up to 100 measurements and voice memos. You can easily bring up all of your logs on its digital display.　BatteryThere’s no need to worry about replacing the batteries. Bagel is built with a lithium polymer battery that lasts up to 24 hours and averages 8 hours with constant use. Any micro USB cable lying around the house is fit to charge Bagel.　Selectable UnitsBagel is for everyone. Whether you use inches, centimeters, or millimeters to measure size, Bagel will adapt to meet your needs. On Bagel's mobile app, you can even choose to display your measurements in feet or meters.  AccuracyWe’ve experimented with various types of sensors, but decided to develop our own. Bagel’s sensor is backed by six patents and we couldn’t be more excited to share its abilities with you.　The error for all three modes should be within 0.5% under room temperature conditions. We are working hard on our firmware to lower the error margin and will provide all updates on any accuracy improvements. DurabilityBagel's casing is made of polycarbonate, which is known to have very high impact resistance. Watch how Bagel can withstand being run over by a car and a drop from 12ft (3.7m) in the video below.  Indiegogo Special GiftsOur Kickstarter campaign that ran from June 29th to August 2nd reached its stretch goals and unlocked these accessories that will help you use Bagel. These are the two add-ons to Bagel that will be provided without extra charge. 1. The leveling tool is an accessory that you can attach to Bagel and easily remove depending on your preference. It will help you measure horizontal and vertical distances more accurately when you’re using Bagel’s remote mode.2. The silicon case is designed protect Bagel from external shocks or scratches. Also, we added a belt clip and a strap to suit various needs.　        
 　 
 We believe in the power of design. We’ve gone through numerous prototypes to make Bagel sleek and easy to hold. Take a look below to see how Bagel has evolved from its first design to its current and final design.Evolution of Bagel  
 We’ve come a long way since last June when we first came up with the idea to create a smart tape measure. Although size measurements are one of the most important ways to describe an object, measuring length or distances have been left to old, traditional tools such as a tape measure. We believed there was so much room to improve how we measure objects. Through digitizing size, our lives can be easier, better, and more efficient. With these beliefs in mind, our team spent countless nights designing, prototyping, testing, programming, and traveling across the globe to pitch our idea and receive feedback on Bagel.Where we've been with Bagel　 
  We are a small, tight-knit team made strong by our members who are experienced professionals in various fields. Although we have different backgrounds in engineering, design, finance, and marketing, we all share one common goal: to innovate the way people measure size.   Tax Free WorldwideTaxes and customs duties will be paid by Bagel Labs before Bagels are shipped out from our distribution centers in the US, the Netherlands, and South Korea. Press KitIf you are a member of the press and need more resources, please download our press kit or reach us at bagellabs@pmbcgroup.com　Images & Video DownloadsPlease feel free to share any of our Indiegogo page materials on social media.

BeCoola is the first product to be developed using this technology. This cooling device is much more efficent that traditional air conditioning and uses just 2W of electricity to cool a room. </p><p>There are still many climate change deniers but it is certain than man made carbon emissions is causing the climate to become more extreme. There is a need for mankind to reduce current carbon emissions by 50%. Unforunately, population increases and rising stadards of living mean that energy consumption and hence carbon emissions are likely to double if we continue using current technologies. This means that average energy consumption will need to be reduced by 75% to avoid damaging climate change!!</p><p>BeCoola uses less than 1% of the energy used by conventional air conditioning to cool a room. Supporting this project will help bring an innovative product to the market which will significantly reduce carbon emissions but allow living standards to rise. Together we can reduce global warming.</p><p>When I started developing BeCoola, I was alone. Within a few months, I started to get some help and support from other people. Over time more people have joined the group working with me.

<div>No longer is it just a dream or wishful thinking, but the voices of so many of you who spoke out on this long overdue issue have made it clear: no longer is it acceptable for trans* individuals, who are already at the greatest risk for prejudice and abuse, to be allowed to suffer in silence.

<div><i>About Us: </i></div>
<div>To those of you who may just be learning of us for the first time, Queens Cottage Shelter is a partnership with Trans House, the Bay Area's first trans housing and advocacy program.  QCS was the brainchild of our founder, Breezy Golden Farr, who found herself homeless after a series of personal setbacks sent her spiraling into the homeless system that is unsafe for trans people. (Meet Breezy in the video above.)</div>
<div>To her shock and dismay, she quickly discovered there was NO place to go exclusively for trans* individuals if you are homeless in the Bay Area. The shelter simply did not know what do with her and she was stuck in limbo and forced to live on the park, Then and there, Ms. Farr vowed that she would never let this happen to another trans person again.  </div>
<div>Today she is partnering with Trans House founder and trans advocate Clair Farley to make this dream a reality. Together with the community Clair and Breezy have raised over $14,000 raised from our first campaign.  Although, we still have much more to do. That is where we need your help! </div>
<div>Like any other start up, we dream of the day when our angel investor (Oprah, are you listening?) writes out the 7 figure check to buy us our first permanent home. But until then, we will keep our cause going by raising funds through fundraisers such as this one. We have set the goal in this campaign at $25,000 and while we still need a 6 figure amount to open and run Queens Cottage Shelter for a full year, every little bit helps us get closer. </div>

It's only 0.76 inch (19.5 mm) thick if include the Fresnel lens. M-Light 4 is lightweight, only 0.6 oz (17 g) including the rechargeable battery.Motion and light activatedM-Light 4 will light up when it detects motion in a dark environment, which is activated by its PIR (Pyroelectric Infrared Radial) sensor and light sensor. The PIR sensor detects the body motion in front of it within a 110° scope, and has an effective range of around 13 feet (4 meters). The light sensor detects the darkness of its surroundings. Only when both sensors are activated will the LED lights be turned on. The lights will be automatically turned off if no other motion is detected for the specified delay time.Automatically turns on and off when waving hand before M-Light 4 in the darkM-Light 4 uses the newest 3rd generation PIR component which integrates its control circuit and PIR sensor in one electromagnetic shielding. Though much more expensive, it provides more accurate control, higher anti-interference capability, and uses less power. Light color selectionM-Light 4 has 2 types for the light color: warm white or cool white. You could make your color selection for each M-Light 4 you pledged in the survey after the campaign is successfully ended.warm white color & cool white colorAlways-on mode Besides the normal Auto Sensing mode, where the lights are turned on and off automatically based on the PIR body motion sensor and the environment darkness sensor, there is light Always-on mode, where the lights are turned on by pushing the power button shortly, and kept on until it is turned off manually by pushing the power button again.With the Always-on mode, M-Light 4 could be used as a flash light, a dinner table candle, a camp light, etc.  Brightness adjustableThe brightness of the LED lights is adjustable to match your needs. That is necessary especially for your nighttime bathroom trips so it will not blind your eyes.Light brightness could be easily selected by a button pressDelay time adjustable This controls the delay time for how long the lights will be kept on after no body action is detected, from 2.5 seconds to 5 minutes. The default delay time is 15 seconds.Within the delay time, if there is any body motion detected, the delay timer will be reset to the specified value.   Easy push button operationM-Light 4 introduced 3 big color push buttons to make the operation much more user-friendly.Long press the power button to power on/offTo power on or off, hold the red power button for 3 seconds until the blue LED indicator flashes 1 or 2 times respectively.Short press the power button to change modesPush the red power button shortly to toggle the Auto Sensing mode and Always-on mode.Change brightnessPush and hold the yellow brightness button, the light brightness will slowly change from low to high, then high to low repeatedly. Release that button when the desired brightness is reachedChange delay timePush the blue delay time button once, the blue LED indicator will light on. When the desired delay time is reached, press that button again to turn it off. The passed time within the 2 presses is recorded as the delay time. To cancel the delay time change before the 2nd press (when the blue LED indicator is still on), press the red power button twice.Long battery lifeM-Light 4 is powered with a 200 mAh lithium-ion polymer rechargeable battery which can be recharged with a normal Micro USB cable. Each battery has a protection circuit to provide the overcharge, over-discharge, and over-current protections.A full charge takes about 2.5 hours and could last 3~6 months depending on how often the light is turned on and how bright it is set to.The red LED turns on when charging and turns off after it is fully chargedLow battery indicator When the battery is low, the blue LED will slowly blink to remind you to recharge the battery. To save the battery life, it only blinks when body motion is detected, whether the environment is bright or dark, so it will remind you even in daytime.Low battery indicatorMagnet attachmentM-Light 4 has a magnet on its back. A small metal plate attached with 3M double sided tape on its back is provided for each M-Light. You stick that metal plate to the needed place, then attach M-Light to the metal plate by its magnet. This way you can easily take M-Light off for recharging its battery.Attach M-Light 4 magnetically to the provided metal plate stuck to a cabinet doorStick anywhere M-Light 4 can be used in any environment where you need some light in the dark, without any hassle of turning it on or off.Besides you can easily put it anywhere such as on the nightstand or desk, you can attach it to the wall of hallway or stairway, or behind the main door so you never have difficult to find the light switch, or put it inside bathroom for your night trips, or inside closet and cabinet to find your stuff at a glance, or even in your handbag so you have no trouble finding anything at night.SpecificationsPerks* Sales tax, GST, VAT, custom fees, if applicable, are not included.* Every perk is provided with a free micro USB recharging cable, except 6-unit perk with 2 cables, and 10-unit perk with 3 cables.TimelineReferral bonusGet one free M-Light 4 unit for every $100 contribution your referrals bring in.For more details, please check Update #1.Risks and challengesM-Light 4 is the 4th version of M-Light. We have been working on the M-Light 4 for several months and have just finished a small patch of production for our Kickstarter backers. So it is ready for production for the current campaign. With our experience in the successful fulfillment of previous M-Light Kickstarter projects, we are confident in this campaign as well. That to be said, there is always the possibility of delays due to things beyond our control at the manufacturer’s facility. We will keep you closely updated with the progress and work hard to deliver your M-Light 4 on schedule.",15.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>Manufacturing Plan</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The electronic components used within the SLL will be procured from distributors that stock well known brands of electronic components.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The LED chip (die) is manufactured in Korea. Electronic components are mounted onto the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) using mostly SMT (Surface Mount Technology).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First, the board goes through the pick and place machine where a robot places individual components in predefined positions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Second, the populated circuit board goes through an oven that melts the solder paste and permanently secures the components. An intermediate testing stage and quality control step is done at this point to ensure that the circuit functions correctly and that no visual defects are found.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The final step is to assemble the circuit board into the shape of a SLL.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After final assembly, each SLL light bulb is put through functional testing.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Records are fundamentally for listening to. They offer a unique listening experience, with unparalleled analogue sound but that’s not all. Each vinyl comes with a protective sleeve with often meticulously designed album art to compliment the sound. We can’t really appreciate the artwork when the record is stored in a traditional record crate so we’ve designed a product which enables you to display your vinyl collection on your wall. Record Roots is a patent pending, expandable frame for your vinyl. </p>
<p>Parallel straps sewn onto canvas hold the top and bottom edges of each record against the wall so unlike normal frames, you can quickly access your records when you want to play them. The product is attached to the wall using damage-free self-adhesive velcro or alternatively, if your wall surface is brick work, you can attach using screws.</p>
<p>One piece displays 8 records but you can zip them together to display as many as you want.</p>

<p><strong>Is the self-adhesive hook and loop tape strong enough?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! The tape has been tested on various different walls for over 6 months and it's not moving.</p>
<p><strong>Will the self-adhesive tape damage my wall when removed?</strong></p>
<p>This tape was designed for mounting onto the wall. It can be carefully removed without taking off any paintwork. It's not recommended on walls with wallpaper although in many instances it won't even damage these walls.</p>
<p><strong>How should I mount it on walls with wallpaper?</strong></p>
<p>In many instances, it will be fine however we can't recommend using the hook and loop tape as in some instances it could cause damage. You can mount it using screws through the eyelets positioned along the top edge of the product.</p>
<p><strong>How should I mount it if my wall is exposed brickwork?</strong></p>
<p>For textured surfaces like brickwork which the hook and loop tape won't stick to we recommend mounting with screws through the o-rings on the top edge.</p>
<p><strong>How can they be joined together?</strong></p>
<p>Open-ended zips are positioned on each vertical edge, which will join onto the next piece.</p>
<p><strong>Can I rotate the frame?</strong></p>
<p>No, the frame must be displayed vertically.</p>
<p><strong>What if I want to buy more than 8 pieces?</strong></p>

</div></div>","Records are fundamentally for listening to. They offer a unique listening experience, with unparalleled analogue sound but that’s not all. Each vinyl comes with a protective sleeve with often meticulously designed album art to compliment the sound. We can’t really appreciate the artwork when the record is stored in a traditional record crate so we’ve designed a product which enables you to display your vinyl collection on your wall. Record Roots is a patent pending, expandable frame for your vinyl. 
Parallel straps sewn onto canvas hold the top and bottom edges of each record against the wall so unlike normal frames, you can quickly access your records when you want to play them. The product is attached to the wall using damage-free self-adhesive velcro or alternatively, if your wall surface is brick work, you can attach using screws.
One piece displays 8 records but you can zip them together to display as many as you want.











Is the self-adhesive hook and loop tape strong enough?
Yes! The tape has been tested on various different walls for over 6 months and it's not moving.
Will the self-adhesive tape damage my wall when removed?
This tape was designed for mounting onto the wall. It can be carefully removed without taking off any paintwork. It's not recommended on walls with wallpaper although in many instances it won't even damage these walls.
How should I mount it on walls with wallpaper?
In many instances, it will be fine however we can't recommend using the hook and loop tape as in some instances it could cause damage. You can mount it using screws through the eyelets positioned along the top edge of the product.
How should I mount it if my wall is exposed brickwork?
For textured surfaces like brickwork which the hook and loop tape won't stick to we recommend mounting with screws through the o-rings on the top edge.
How can they be joined together?
Open-ended zips are positioned on each vertical edge, which will join onto the next piece.
Can I rotate the frame?
No, the frame must be displayed vertically.
What if I want to buy more than 8 pieces?
Please get in touch!
Where do you ship to?
We'll be shipping worldwide!
Are you going to offer Record Roots for 7""?
If we're successfully funded, we may consider it in the future!
I've got another question. What can I do?
Please send us a message and we'll aim to get back to you as soon as possible.

The average cup of coffee, however, only utilises a minuscule 0.2% of the coffee with the remaining 99.8% becoming coffee grounds thrown into the trash. By using S.Cafe® technology, we are able to recycle this previously wasted 99.8%, to transform coffee grounds into a yarn which can be used in bedding. </p><p>Coffee grounds also have excellent ability to remove foul smells, even one of the worst smells around -- sewer gas!

This is because during roasting, the beans swell and the hot water removes materials clogging the space, meaning the inside of the bean expands, allowing for odor absorption and fast drying functions. After the coffee beans are ground, used in coffee making and discarded, they are reclaimed to be used to make coffee yarn. The coffee grounds are embedded onto a yarn fiber, using a low temperature, high-pressure and energy saving process.</p><p>During this process, the filaments of the fiber change and lock and embed the coffee grounds into the yarn. The yarn fiber used is made from recycled plastic water bottles, another high-tech and sustainable material. The oils in the grounds, which produce the coffee scent are also removed through a pharmaceutical process so you won’t be kept awake all night.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Bamboo Lyocell Yarn</strong></h3><p>Bamboo Lyocell is a fabric that consists of fiber made from dissolving organic bamboo pulp. We are the FIRST company in the world to make 100% Bamboo Lyocell bedding. This fabric is superior to any other bamboo products on the market right now which use the traditional viscose/rayon process. Lyocell fabrication process is the most sustainable fabrication process, using a closed-loop system. 99% of the organic solvent and water in the process is recycled and reused up to 200 times. This process has minimal environmental impact, with economical use of both energy and water. Bamboo Lyocell fabric is incredibly soft, silky and super breathable.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>S.Cafe® Coffee Yarn + Bamboo Lyocell</strong></h3><p>The S.Cafe® coffee yarn (35%) is woven together with Bamboo Lyocell yarn (65%) in the fabrication process to create these odor control and fast drying sheets that bring you the freshest sleep environment.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500273211/vljscrsjazjmbam3ybpr.png"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>This Is How Your New Favourite Bedding Looks</strong></h3><h3> </h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500273417/eyojm0ytfz37cjxys7fm.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Design &amp; Sizing</strong></h3><p>We offer modern and neutral colours that will work in any home.

However, the process of frequently washing and drying your bedding takes up valuable time; taking you away from doing the things that you love. Ettitude has created a range of new high-performance, sustainable bedding that absorbs odor and drys faster than any other bedding in the world to avoid the growth of bacteria - saving you time, water and electricity.Introducing Bamboo Coffee Sheets - a blend of our signature Bamboo Lyocell fabric and reclaimed coffee grounds.Coffee grounds may seem like an unlikely sleep partner but we can assure you it will give you the best sleep of your life. By harnessing coffee’s natural ability to block odors, these sheets have excellent odor neutralizing and moisture wicking abilities, so your sheets can stay fresh for longer. No more musty-smelling sheets ever! 
Ettitude As Seen In Press
  Why You Want to Sleep With Bamboo Coffee   Why Use Coffee Grounds?Coffee makes the world go round, with over 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed in the world every day! The average cup of coffee, however, only utilises a minuscule 0.2% of the coffee with the remaining 99.8% becoming coffee grounds thrown into the trash. By using S.Cafe® technology, we are able to recycle this previously wasted 99.8%, to transform coffee grounds into a yarn which can be used in bedding. Coffee grounds also have excellent ability to remove foul smells, even one of the worst smells around -- sewer gas! Scientists at The City College of New York (CCNY) found that used coffee grounds can sop up hydrogen sulfide gas, the chemical that makes raw sewage stinky. That's how powerful used coffee ground as a deodorizer! Odour NeutralisingMany people experience night sweat during their sleep. This can cause a rough night’s sleep and will mean your sheets need to be washed sooner. When sweat and odor pass through the fabric, it is absorbed into the micropores of the coffee yarn fibers, virtually eliminating it, allowing you to stay fresh all night and your sheets to remain cleaner for longer. Fast DryingS.Cafe® coffee yarn is also used by some of the biggest athletic and adventure wear companies due to its fast drying ability. We are the first in the world to use the S.Cafe® technology in bedding.This unique bamboo coffee fabric can move moisture away from the skin to the outer surface of the fabric for a faster drying process. Imagine the structure sort of like a sponge, lots of surface area to spread, absorb and dry faster. This function is permanent and will never wash out. So bacterias don't get the chance to breed and grow on your sheets and create that unpleasant musty smell! How Do Coffee Grounds Turn Into YarnFirstly, only coffee beans which have been roasted and ground can be used to produce coffee yarn. This is because during roasting, the beans swell and the hot water removes materials clogging the space, meaning the inside of the bean expands, allowing for odor absorption and fast drying functions. After the coffee beans are ground, used in coffee making and discarded, they are reclaimed to be used to make coffee yarn. The coffee grounds are embedded onto a yarn fiber, using a low temperature, high-pressure and energy saving process.During this process, the filaments of the fiber change and lock and embed the coffee grounds into the yarn. The yarn fiber used is made from recycled plastic water bottles, another high-tech and sustainable material. The oils in the grounds, which produce the coffee scent are also removed through a pharmaceutical process so you won’t be kept awake all night. Bamboo Lyocell YarnBamboo Lyocell is a fabric that consists of fiber made from dissolving organic bamboo pulp. We are the FIRST company in the world to make 100% Bamboo Lyocell bedding. This fabric is superior to any other bamboo products on the market right now which use the traditional viscose/rayon process. Lyocell fabrication process is the most sustainable fabrication process, using a closed-loop system. 99% of the organic solvent and water in the process is recycled and reused up to 200 times. This process has minimal environmental impact, with economical use of both energy and water. Bamboo Lyocell fabric is incredibly soft, silky and super breathable. S.Cafe® Coffee Yarn + Bamboo LyocellThe S.Cafe® coffee yarn (35%) is woven together with Bamboo Lyocell yarn (65%) in the fabrication process to create these odor control and fast drying sheets that bring you the freshest sleep environment. This Is How Your New Favourite Bedding Looks  Design & SizingWe offer modern and neutral colours that will work in any home.

Now, with new and improved Avoseedo Nü, growing your own avocado tree is easier than ever!</p><p><strong>Avocados are one of nature’s superfruits; they’re full of valuable nutrients like unsaturated fatty acids and vitamins. Avocados are native to subtropical regions, but with a little ingenuity and the right tools, they can be grown in colder parts of the world too. The key is the seed has to be kept wet all through the germination process. AvoSeedo Nü has been developed to facilitate the germination process even more effectively than the original. It has never been easier to grow your own avocado trees!​</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597182815/lapwoxfy5mvcihgfcn6v.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>The avocado: Usage and cultivation</h3><p>Avocados have been grown as a crop plant since ancient times. Originating from Latin America, the enormous nutritive value of the “ahuacatl” was well known amongst the indigenous populations. However, it was only a century ago that the avocado found a new home in (southern) Europe. Nowadays, the pear-shaped, alligator-skinned fruits are a common sight in pretty much every supermarket – and on our tables. Outright tasty when consumed fresh and raw, they can also be refined with spices (resulting in the popular guacamole) or stuffed with any filling that pleases your pallet. Needless to say, avocados make a perfect addition to any diet.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597185442/ahpvwa4dd0gkj5qlqy85.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Although avocado trees like it warm and cozy, they can handle lower temperatures (as in central Europe, the US, or Canada) quite well. Basically, the seed of every “common supermarket avocado” can germinate and grow to full size (up to 15 meters!). However, simply putting the seed in the ground won’t work. Rather, the “pointy” end should be facing the sun (without being exposed to permanent, direct sunlight). At the same time, the flattened end should be kept wet at all times.</p><p>There are two common methods to make an avocado seed germinate. One method is to place the seed inside a biodegradable pot and leave it at a bright, warm place. After one to two months, the first small roots will begin to show.</p><p>A more sophisticated, second alternative is the so-called “toothpick method.” Three or four toothpicks are inserted into the outer layer of the avocado seed. They prevent the seed from sinking when it is placed on a glass of water. As a result, the seed’s bottom will be kept wet as required, while the “pointy” end can receive the proper amount of sunlight. This germination method will also take between one and two months.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597335125/pejbe0w4s7bgl4zt7bek.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.avoseedo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/glass_comp.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>In both cases, however, a great deal of attention has to be paid to guarantee permanent water supply for the “flat” end. This is the main challenge when growing an avocado; if the seed is left high and dry at any time, there’s a chance that the germination process will permanently cease. This is where AvoSeedo comes into play.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597185974/brslak7v8mg9xmjyjbtu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Our small, elaborate tool builds on the idea behind the toothpick method. AvoSeedo is a small plastic bowl that features an indentation with a hole in it. A single avocado seed can be inserted with the “flat” end facing down. Afterward, AvoSeedo can be placed in a sufficiently large, water-filled pot. Due to its low weight and high displacement, AvoSeedo will remain at the surface all the time; as the water level lowers, AvoSeedo will sink accordingly. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597186089/c307da5tzmgpg84e85td.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>AvoSeedo Nü’s closed-top construction makes it even easier to germinate your avocado seed. This feature prevents the AvoSeedo from becoming water-logged and potentially sinking to the bottom. It also enables you to use your AvoSeedo outside if you so choose.</p><p> </p><p>As long as some water remains in the pot, there is little chance that the seed will dry out – thanks to the “ground hole”. It also allows the developing roots to grow and to expand freely. By the way, the hole is not simply round but has the shape of a blossom instead. While this may as well add to the aesthetical appearance of AvoSeedo, it is also a functional feature. It makes sure that the avocado seed will be held firmly in its cradle; even if the seed cracks open during the germination process, it won’t sink.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597192837/bvlwus8xxn98m4kzz74g.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597244937/e76b2x12vyrs6t6ont4l.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>With AvoSeedo, you can significantly increase the success rate when it comes to avocado germination. Without any risk, you can decrease the watering intervals drastically. From time to time, you will have to check the water level of the pot containing the AvoSeedo and avocado seed.

Now, with new and improved Avoseedo Nü, growing your own avocado tree is easier than ever!Avocados are one of nature’s superfruits; they’re full of valuable nutrients like unsaturated fatty acids and vitamins. Avocados are native to subtropical regions, but with a little ingenuity and the right tools, they can be grown in colder parts of the world too. The key is the seed has to be kept wet all through the germination process. AvoSeedo Nü has been developed to facilitate the germination process even more effectively than the original. It has never been easier to grow your own avocado trees!​The avocado: Usage and cultivationAvocados have been grown as a crop plant since ancient times. Originating from Latin America, the enormous nutritive value of the “ahuacatl” was well known amongst the indigenous populations. However, it was only a century ago that the avocado found a new home in (southern) Europe. Nowadays, the pear-shaped, alligator-skinned fruits are a common sight in pretty much every supermarket – and on our tables. Outright tasty when consumed fresh and raw, they can also be refined with spices (resulting in the popular guacamole) or stuffed with any filling that pleases your pallet. Needless to say, avocados make a perfect addition to any diet.Although avocado trees like it warm and cozy, they can handle lower temperatures (as in central Europe, the US, or Canada) quite well. Basically, the seed of every “common supermarket avocado” can germinate and grow to full size (up to 15 meters!). However, simply putting the seed in the ground won’t work. Rather, the “pointy” end should be facing the sun (without being exposed to permanent, direct sunlight). At the same time, the flattened end should be kept wet at all times.There are two common methods to make an avocado seed germinate. One method is to place the seed inside a biodegradable pot and leave it at a bright, warm place. After one to two months, the first small roots will begin to show.A more sophisticated, second alternative is the so-called “toothpick method.” Three or four toothpicks are inserted into the outer layer of the avocado seed. They prevent the seed from sinking when it is placed on a glass of water. As a result, the seed’s bottom will be kept wet as required, while the “pointy” end can receive the proper amount of sunlight. This germination method will also take between one and two months.In both cases, however, a great deal of attention has to be paid to guarantee permanent water supply for the “flat” end. This is the main challenge when growing an avocado; if the seed is left high and dry at any time, there’s a chance that the germination process will permanently cease. This is where AvoSeedo comes into play.Our small, elaborate tool builds on the idea behind the toothpick method. AvoSeedo is a small plastic bowl that features an indentation with a hole in it. A single avocado seed can be inserted with the “flat” end facing down. Afterward, AvoSeedo can be placed in a sufficiently large, water-filled pot. Due to its low weight and high displacement, AvoSeedo will remain at the surface all the time; as the water level lowers, AvoSeedo will sink accordingly. AvoSeedo Nü’s closed-top construction makes it even easier to germinate your avocado seed. This feature prevents the AvoSeedo from becoming water-logged and potentially sinking to the bottom. It also enables you to use your AvoSeedo outside if you so choose. As long as some water remains in the pot, there is little chance that the seed will dry out – thanks to the “ground hole”. It also allows the developing roots to grow and to expand freely. By the way, the hole is not simply round but has the shape of a blossom instead. While this may as well add to the aesthetical appearance of AvoSeedo, it is also a functional feature. It makes sure that the avocado seed will be held firmly in its cradle; even if the seed cracks open during the germination process, it won’t sink.With AvoSeedo, you can significantly increase the success rate when it comes to avocado germination. Without any risk, you can decrease the watering intervals drastically. From time to time, you will have to check the water level of the pot containing the AvoSeedo and avocado seed. Compared to the original toothpick method, there’s another advantage: the avocado seed doesn’t need to be perforated, reducing the risk of damage (and thus, failed germination efforts). And finally, AvoSeedo features a mounting that can be used to attach small flags. These can be inscribed with the date when germination started, with strain names or with additional information. Thus, you can easily keep track, even when germinating several avocado seeds at the same time.All in all, AvoSeedo is the perfect tool for you to grow avocado trees at home. The demanding germination period can now be mastered with virtually no effort, giving your new trees an edge right from the beginning!",19.0,0,"2 Campaigns

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p><strong>Our Journey to parenthood. </strong></p>
<p>We are Josh and Cherie MacLean, and here is our story...well so far.</p>
<p>We met at work in 2000 and, after being friends for a few months, we started dating. Josh was kind, loving, intelligent, thoughtful, and my best friend. We dated for two years, then got married. We decided to start a family which was not as easy for us as it is for most. We went to a doctor after a year of trying and he said everything is fine just keep trying... After a while we went to another doctor, then another, and yet another they couldn't figure out what was wrong.<br/><br/> We recently found the cause of our difficulties in getting pregnant. Our journey has been long. We have been to 9 doctors in about the same number of years, and endured endless drugs and treatments. We finally found out our inability to conceive is a result of a car accident I had when I was 18 years old. The resulting surgeries, and internal bleeding left adhesions on my tubes. So to have a baby we have to do Invitro. It is good to finally know what has caused all this. When they told me, it was really hard to hear that something that happened so long ago, that took a long time to recover from, had been causing all this sorrow and heartache. I do feel blessed every day to be alive!!!</p>
<p><strong>The Cost </strong></p>
<p> But, now we have to come up with the money. We have gone through many thousands of dollars to get to this point. Our savings has been exhausted. So, we are with a nervous, but optimistic heart, seeking out help from our loved ones and caring strangers. We hope this charity site will help us to start our family. </p>
<p>Invitro is about $ 14,000 and our clinic offers a discounted plan that if you pay for three rounds up front, then you get a discount. So it comes out to about $28,000, that includes three treatments. If you don’t end up with a baby after three treatments you get 70% of your money back, and we would then use that to adopt.</p>
<p>We put our goal at $14,000 because that would give us at least one chance but we would love to be able to make it to the ultimate goal of $28,000 so we would have three tries and if it didn’t work we would have the money to adopt. <br/><br/> We would appreciate it if you would send it out to as many people as you can, to see if you can help make our dreams of having a family come true. This has been one of the hardest things we have had to go through.  We know many others have trials that are hard and seem never ending. This has been ours. It has been a hard decision to put our private struggle out on display, but we need your help. <br/><br/> We want to thank our family and friends who have been supportive through the tears and heartache. Who have been our cheerleaders when we couldn't be our own. Who have brought baskets of love to our doors and spent hours upon hours listening to, and loving us. We cannot say how much it has meant to us to have such wonderful people in our lives we are truly blessed to be so loved by so many.</p>
<p><br/> Invitro or Bust... After 9 Years <br/><br/> Much Love, <br/> Josh &amp; Cherie MacLean</p></div>","Our Journey to parenthood. 
We are Josh and Cherie MacLean, and here is our story...well so far.
We met at work in 2000 and, after being friends for a few months, we started dating. Josh was kind, loving, intelligent, thoughtful, and my best friend. We dated for two years, then got married. We decided to start a family which was not as easy for us as it is for most. We went to a doctor after a year of trying and he said everything is fine just keep trying... After a while we went to another doctor, then another, and yet another they couldn't figure out what was wrong. We recently found the cause of our difficulties in getting pregnant. Our journey has been long. We have been to 9 doctors in about the same number of years, and endured endless drugs and treatments. We finally found out our inability to conceive is a result of a car accident I had when I was 18 years old. The resulting surgeries, and internal bleeding left adhesions on my tubes. So to have a baby we have to do Invitro. It is good to finally know what has caused all this. When they told me, it was really hard to hear that something that happened so long ago, that took a long time to recover from, had been causing all this sorrow and heartache. I do feel blessed every day to be alive!!!
The Cost 
 But, now we have to come up with the money. We have gone through many thousands of dollars to get to this point. Our savings has been exhausted. So, we are with a nervous, but optimistic heart, seeking out help from our loved ones and caring strangers. We hope this charity site will help us to start our family. 
Invitro is about $ 14,000 and our clinic offers a discounted plan that if you pay for three rounds up front, then you get a discount. So it comes out to about $28,000, that includes three treatments. If you don’t end up with a baby after three treatments you get 70% of your money back, and we would then use that to adopt.
We put our goal at $14,000 because that would give us at least one chance but we would love to be able to make it to the ultimate goal of $28,000 so we would have three tries and if it didn’t work we would have the money to adopt.  We would appreciate it if you would send it out to as many people as you can, to see if you can help make our dreams of having a family come true. This has been one of the hardest things we have had to go through.  We know many others have trials that are hard and seem never ending. This has been ours. It has been a hard decision to put our private struggle out on display, but we need your help.  We want to thank our family and friends who have been supportive through the tears and heartache. Who have been our cheerleaders when we couldn't be our own. Who have brought baskets of love to our doors and spent hours upon hours listening to, and loving us. We cannot say how much it has meant to us to have such wonderful people in our lives we are truly blessed to be so loved by so many.

<h3>Introducing the ""be loved pillow"" !</h3>
<p>We are ready and excited to go full force in reaching out to ALL (military families, foster kids, anyone in the grief and loss process, college students, children of divorce, toddlers in daycare...everyone and anyone that appreciates a good cuddle) of our potential customers.</p>
<p>We want these pillows in the arms of millions and you can help us do that:</p>
<p> Tell people about our campaign by sending our link to all your facebook friends, your family and email contacts.</p>
<p>And, of course, by making a direct donation to our campaign - your money will turn into something wonderful to hold !</p>
<p>If we get funded beyond our set funding goal, which we are hoping to do since we have only asked for the minimum to get us going, we will ramp up our advertising and order more  pillows and sell them to more people !</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My husband (Scot) and I (Katey) , both artists living in Santa Fe NM, designed a unique and much needed pillow we named the ""be loved pillow"".</p>
<p>Orignally I made the ""be loved pillow"" for children attending a grief and loss workshop. I presented the pillow to the kids as a place to put memorabilia and keepsakes from the one they lost and as a place they could put their own drawings, journals, letters etc. that express how they feel at the moment. The pillow was meant to help them  process their grief, a place where ALL of their emotions could be safely expressed and offer them comfort all at once.The children LOVED them and immediately started to talk about what they were going to put inside and why. The drawings and collages they made that day went directly inside the pillow, which they carried with them snug in their arms. Because of the way the children responded I decided to make more. I made the next bunch of pillows for children and teens in a foster program and they loved them too ! For the foster kids it became a safe and warm place to put their most cherished items during their frequent times of transition.</p>
<p>The ""be loved pillow"" is a pillow with a deep and soft interior - an interior made for your special treasures.  When you put your most cherished things inside this pillow you transform them into cuddle-able comfort.  Originally the ""be loved pillow"" was designed for those of us who miss someone, but the fact is, we ALL need some comfort, we ALL need the ""be loved pillow"" !</p>
<p>The ""be loved pillow"" is made from 100% cotton blue denim (on the outside) and soft brushed 100% cotton flannel (on the inside) and filled with 100% cotton batting, it is washable, synthetic free !</p>
<p>Our funding goal of $15,000 will pay for :  1st manufactured prototype, the first 1,000 pillows to be made, shipping costs and our initial few months of power marketing/advertising.</p>
