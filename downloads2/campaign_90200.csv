<em>Kickstarter Project:  </em><a href=""http://www.calccases.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CalcCases.com</a> - A Smartphone Calculator Case</h1>
<p>Hi everyone.  I have an exciting new project that I believe will be well received by the millions of smartphone users out there.  I started a new company called <a href=""http://CalcCases.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CalcCases.com</a> and over the last year, I have developed a working prototype that I show in my main video above.  I created this project because I am seeking funding for an improved second prototype and cases for more smartphone models.    </p>
<h1>What is a Smartphone Calculator Case?</h1>
<p>Everyone runs into a situation when they need to do a quick calculation. Whether you are in a store trying to figure out a discounted price, at home trying to add up bills, at work figuring up your overtime pay or hundreds of other places. This is why I created <a href=""http://www.calccases.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CalcCases.com</a>. CalcCases give you great protection for your Smartphone but it also gives you a working calculator with some cool functions right on the back of your case! Just flip your phone over and start using the calculator. It is that fast and easy.</p>
<p>Yes you could use an app to do the calculation, but when you are in a hurry, it is a pain to wake up your Smartphone, unlock the screen, find the right calculator app and finally do the calculation. Besides, when you use your phone you are also using your precious battery minutes.</p>
<p>I always carry my phone around with me and I am constantly spending good money to buy simple everyday phone cases. I thought it would be so much easier to have a working calculator on that back of my case that I have with me at all times. Once I had my own Calculator Case, I found that I use it all the time in multiple situations and I now cannot live without it.</p>
<p>Since I go out to restaurants often with friends, I thought it would be very beneficial to have a split bill calculator function built into my CalcCases. It is very simple to add in a tip to the total bill and split the bill into several parties. You can also add or subtract percentages easily with just a few keystrokes and there is a Previous button so you can go back and make sure you added up all the numbers into a total.</p>
<p>I believe I have created a Smartphone calculator case that is retro styled, very useful, easy to use and handy.</p>
<h1>How it started</h1>
<p>I thought of the idea when I was working on the road.While traveling, I did not always have a handheld calculator with me. I constantly needed to calculate figures, dimensions, capacities and engineering units and I mainly used my laptop accessory calculator or calculator app on my phone. The problem with both methods was I had to unlock my phone or laptop, pull up the right calculator and use battery power while I was working through the numbers. I kept thinking that it would be better to have a calculator right on my iPhone case. I could just flip it over and use it any time I needed. The case could have it’s own battery and I could actually feel the keys when I used it. I paid enough for plain old phone cases that had no functionality so I thought there has to be a better way. At that point in time, <a href=""http://CalcCases.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CalcCases.com</a> was born.</p>
<p>I decided to design and create a prototype in order to see if it was possible. I created a hand sketched drawing in a hotel room to begin the process. See my sketch below.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""First Sketch"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/493/751/51121e93b66bf7a861b4e1a020dc5ea3_large.JPG?1365133105"" src="""" style=""""/>First Sketch</div>
<p>In order to protect my idea, I decided to create a patent application. I downloaded all the forms from the US Patent Office on line and read all the instructions. It is about as fun as doing taxes. Once I figured out the process I submitted for a patent for my design with multiple pictures and descriptions of functionality. I waited for about 3 months and received a patent pending number and an estimate of when I would have a patent hearing. Of course being the government, they told me it would be at least another year before I would have my patent hearing. I did however obtain a patent pending number that would protect my idea and design.</p>
<p>After sketching the product and submitting for a patent, I created non-working prototypes on different cases. Below is a picture of one of my first non-working prototypes:</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/493/753/24f388cca1dfcbc34a191ab8a86d38bf_large.JPG?1365133167"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>I then looked for a company that could help me manufacture a working prototype.This was very difficult. I sent letters to different companies in the US, I contacted existing smart phone case companies, I did research on calculator companies but I did not get any replies or responses. I kept searching online for different resources and friends in the electronics business and I found someone that would make me a prototype for under $20,000.  I spent weeks working with them on integrated circuit functions and calculator programming and then on case designs and materials.</p>
<p>Finally after several months work with the manufacturer (and thousands of dollars of my own money), we came up with the following 3D picture of the first Calculator Case:</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/493/754/f4018215b5800fe04f63f3f0bdc9abb5_large.jpg?1365133206"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>It looked slim and had some great functions and I really liked the retro styling. We worked for a few more months on form, fit, material and calculations and then I ordered the first working prototype.</p>

<p>We worked a long time on calculation flowcharts and programming keys. We wanted to make it fast and easy to add and subtract percentages so if you were in a store, you could quickly calculate 30% off your purchase.  We believe we have created fast and easy calculations and a very handy Split Bill Functions that everyone can use at their favorite restaurant.  This allows you to easily add a tip and split your bill with your friends.   Here are two videos that show the prototype features:</p>

<div class=""template oembed""> There is no other case on the market like it and no case manufacturer had a working calculator. I showed the prototype to my friends and family and they all wanted one for their iPhone. Many people I ran into had Samsung Galaxy S III phones and they wanted one too.

Anytime I needed to do a quick calculation, I just flipped my phone over and calculated the numbers without using my phone battery at all. It was fast and convenient.  Every time I had it up to my ear and was talking on the phone, the calculator would show on the outside and people would ask me where I got my cell phone calculator.

I also need funding assistance to be able to create more smart phone case models for Apple, Samsung, HTC and Nokia.Each case model cost thousands of dollars to create. I will not be able to compete with larger case makers if I don’t offer more smart phone case models. I also need funding for the production run. The Manufacturer is asking for tens of thousands to start production and another 20K for setting the moulds. I plan to offer three colors of each model in Black, Blue and Pink.  You will be able to pick the color you desire.  Below provides you an idea of all the tasks that have already been completed and the tasks that still need to be done for this product to be successful.

Hi everyone.  I have an exciting new project that I believe will be well received by the millions of smartphone users out there.  I started a new company called CalcCases.com and over the last year, I have developed a working prototype that I show in my main video above.  I created this project because I am seeking funding for an improved second prototype and cases for more smartphone models.    
What is a Smartphone Calculator Case?
Everyone runs into a situation when they need to do a quick calculation. Whether you are in a store trying to figure out a discounted price, at home trying to add up bills, at work figuring up your overtime pay or hundreds of other places. This is why I created CalcCases.com. CalcCases give you great protection for your Smartphone but it also gives you a working calculator with some cool functions right on the back of your case! Just flip your phone over and start using the calculator. It is that fast and easy.
Yes you could use an app to do the calculation, but when you are in a hurry, it is a pain to wake up your Smartphone, unlock the screen, find the right calculator app and finally do the calculation. Besides, when you use your phone you are also using your precious battery minutes.
I always carry my phone around with me and I am constantly spending good money to buy simple everyday phone cases. I thought it would be so much easier to have a working calculator on that back of my case that I have with me at all times. Once I had my own Calculator Case, I found that I use it all the time in multiple situations and I now cannot live without it.
Since I go out to restaurants often with friends, I thought it would be very beneficial to have a split bill calculator function built into my CalcCases. It is very simple to add in a tip to the total bill and split the bill into several parties. You can also add or subtract percentages easily with just a few keystrokes and there is a Previous button so you can go back and make sure you added up all the numbers into a total.
I believe I have created a Smartphone calculator case that is retro styled, very useful, easy to use and handy.
How it started
I thought of the idea when I was working on the road.While traveling, I did not always have a handheld calculator with me. I constantly needed to calculate figures, dimensions, capacities and engineering units and I mainly used my laptop accessory calculator or calculator app on my phone. The problem with both methods was I had to unlock my phone or laptop, pull up the right calculator and use battery power while I was working through the numbers. I kept thinking that it would be better to have a calculator right on my iPhone case. I could just flip it over and use it any time I needed. The case could have it’s own battery and I could actually feel the keys when I used it. I paid enough for plain old phone cases that had no functionality so I thought there has to be a better way. At that point in time, CalcCases.com was born.
I decided to design and create a prototype in order to see if it was possible. I created a hand sketched drawing in a hotel room to begin the process. See my sketch below.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>IOTrain is a simple, small yet brilliant piece of innovation which allows Arduino to have as many digital IOs as you wish. Each module adds 24 IOs to your project and you can cascade multiple such modules to fulfill your project requirements</p>
<h3>Who We are</h3>
<p>I am Tushar Jambhekar, I own Jambhekar Automation Solutions.We are experts in electronics and PC based Industrial automation. For past 7 years we are in this field and in India we have provided services to companies like Whirlpool, John Deere, Emerson etc.</p>
<h3>The Story Behind IOTrain</h3>
<p>For quite some time I am working on Arduino. and it is awesome development platform . It simplifies the development a lot.</p>
<p>However when you select a particular Arduino board you are limiting the number of IOs that can be utilized in your project. E.g. UNO is having 14, Leonardo is having 20 whereas ADK has got 54. </p>
<p>If your projects needs more IOs; then things suddenly get quite tough. You might need to</p>
<ol>
<li>Design custom circuits</li>
<li>Implement complex protocols like SPI, I2C etc.</li>
<li>Spend many days in debugging code.</li>
<li>Struggle to comply with timing constraints.</li>
<li>Spend money on costly equipments to analyze timing characteristics.</li>
</ol>
<p>And so complexities pile up.</p>
<p><b>I wanted to eliminate all these complexities once for all.</b></p>
<p>I believe that developing small projects on Arduino is simple and <b>it should remain simple irrespective of size of project.</b></p>
<h3>Meet IOTrain and Say No To Complexities</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/90074/files/20130922235836-IOTrainModule.png?1379919516"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/90219/files/20130923022030-iotrainpinhead.png?1379928030"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>IO train is cascadable IO expander which goes well with Ardiuno philosophy. Each IOTrain Module has got 24 digital IOs. and you can cascade as many modules as you want till the time you don’t hit total of 65000 IOs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also for interfacing IOTrain to Arduino or compatible board you don’t need to learn much. <b>IOTrain comes with its own open source Arduino library</b>. Library functions are similar to Arduino’s digitalWrite and digitalRead functions</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Under the hood IO Train uses I2C protocol. During initialization of IOTrain auto detection algorithm in firmware detects the number of modules attached to i2c bus of Arduino. Each module on bus assign itself appropriate channel numbers (e.g. first module takes channel number 0-23, second module occupies 23-47 and so on.). and subsequent commands can use channel number for reading or writing status information on it.</p>
<h4>Blink Program with IOTrain</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/77074/files/20130916071404-code.png?1379340844"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wuu7Jvdczrc?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<h3>IOTrain is Open Hardware and Open Source</h3>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/77056/files/20130916070212-iotrain.png?1379340132"" src="""" style=""""/></p>On successful completion we will release the source files of software and hardware on our product site<p></p>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<p>IOTrain can be used to extend IOs on any Arduino or Arduino compatible board which has got hardware i2c interface. It consumes only two pins on Arduino and in return can happily give back hundreds of IOs.</p>
<p>Technically IO Train can be used by any device which is capable of communicating over i2c. but it will need IOTrain library to be ported for the device.</p>
<p>IOTrain works on 5V logic levels hence level shifter will be required for devices that do not work with 5V levels.(We or working on it and trying to make it work on both 5 and 3.3V levels)</p>
<p>Are you thinking about using<b> IOTrain with Raspberry PI</b>? We feel that its a great idea. and as soon as we hit the project goal we will introduce the stretched goal for porting IOTrain to RaspberryPi. We will also add 3.3V &lt;-&gt; 5V level shifter board required by raspberry pi as a perk</p>
<h3>What is Current Status of Project</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/90249/files/20130923031058-Workin.png?1379931058"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We have created 5 prototype boards for IOTrain. we have completed the development of firmware and we have also completed the IOTrain Library for Arduino.</p>
<p>By cascading 5 IOTrain modules we have tested it for up to 120 channels of input as well as outputs and it is working great</p>
<h3>What Needs To Be Done Yet</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/110189/files/20131003023855-iotrain_smdLook.png?1380793135"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Preview of Final smd Board</p>
<p><b>Double layer PTH PCBs instead of current single layer ones</b></p>
<p>Our current prototype PCBs are manufactured in house using single layer design. However for final product we will be using double layer PTH PCBs. Design of new PCB is complete but manufacturing will be done immediately after completion of campaign. (Double layer PCBs always perform better than single layer PCBs hence this does not involve any risk)</p>
<p><b>One more prototype run</b></p>
<p>Our current prototype is working great however we will be creating one more prototype which will focus on making board compact and sexier.</p>
<p><b>Validate that IOTrain works for very very high channel counts</b></p>
<p>Theoretically IOTrain supports up to 65000 channels however we have tested it only up to 120 channels. Upon receiving of funds we will manufacture multiple boards and will test it for at least 1024 channels. (We have already simulated most of the situations like extended lengths of i2c bus etc. but we still need to test with lots and lots of cascaded boards)</p>
<p><b>Ensure quality of manufactured product using automated test equipment</b></p>
<p>We want to make sure that each module delivered to our customers is defect free. We are ready to invest time and money required for that. We already have plans for automated test system to test each manufactured module before dispatch.</p>

Implement complex protocols like SPI, I2C etc.
Spend many days in debugging code.
Struggle to comply with timing constraints.
Spend money on costly equipments to analyze timing characteristics.

And so complexities pile up.
I wanted to eliminate all these complexities once for all.
I believe that developing small projects on Arduino is simple and it should remain simple irrespective of size of project.
Meet IOTrain and Say No To Complexities


IO train is cascadable IO expander which goes well with Ardiuno philosophy. Each IOTrain Module has got 24 digital IOs. and you can cascade as many modules as you want till the time you don’t hit total of 65000 IOs.

Also for interfacing IOTrain to Arduino or compatible board you don’t need to learn much. IOTrain comes with its own open source Arduino library. Library functions are similar to Arduino’s digitalWrite and digitalRead functions
How It Works
Under the hood IO Train uses I2C protocol. During initialization of IOTrain auto detection algorithm in firmware detects the number of modules attached to i2c bus of Arduino. Each module on bus assign itself appropriate channel numbers (e.g. first module takes channel number 0-23, second module occupies 23-47 and so on.). and subsequent commands can use channel number for reading or writing status information on it.
Blink Program with IOTrain


IOTrain is Open Hardware and Open Source

On successful completion we will release the source files of software and hardware on our product site
Compatibility
IOTrain can be used to extend IOs on any Arduino or Arduino compatible board which has got hardware i2c interface. It consumes only two pins on Arduino and in return can happily give back hundreds of IOs.
Technically IO Train can be used by any device which is capable of communicating over i2c. but it will need IOTrain library to be ported for the device.
IOTrain works on 5V logic levels hence level shifter will be required for devices that do not work with 5V levels.(We or working on it and trying to make it work on both 5 and 3.3V levels)
Are you thinking about using IOTrain with Raspberry PI? We feel that its a great idea. and as soon as we hit the project goal we will introduce the stretched goal for porting IOTrain to RaspberryPi. We will also add 3.3V <-> 5V level shifter board required by raspberry pi as a perk
What is Current Status of Project

We have created 5 prototype boards for IOTrain. we have completed the development of firmware and we have also completed the IOTrain Library for Arduino.
By cascading 5 IOTrain modules we have tested it for up to 120 channels of input as well as outputs and it is working great
What Needs To Be Done Yet

Preview of Final smd Board
Double layer PTH PCBs instead of current single layer ones
Our current prototype PCBs are manufactured in house using single layer design. However for final product we will be using double layer PTH PCBs. Design of new PCB is complete but manufacturing will be done immediately after completion of campaign. (Double layer PCBs always perform better than single layer PCBs hence this does not involve any risk)
One more prototype run
Our current prototype is working great however we will be creating one more prototype which will focus on making board compact and sexier.
Validate that IOTrain works for very very high channel counts
Theoretically IOTrain supports up to 65000 channels however we have tested it only up to 120 channels. Upon receiving of funds we will manufacture multiple boards and will test it for at least 1024 channels. (We have already simulated most of the situations like extended lengths of i2c bus etc. but we still need to test with lots and lots of cascaded boards)
Ensure quality of manufactured product using automated test equipment
We want to make sure that each module delivered to our customers is defect free. We are ready to invest time and money required for that. We already have plans for automated test system to test each manufactured module before dispatch.
What We Need and What You Get
We need your support to turn this project into reality. To bring prices down we need to mass produce our modules. So please Support us by picking biggest perk you can. By passionately picking bigger perk you are not only supporting for a cause but you are also receiving back a bigger reward.
Please don't stop yourself just by picking the big perk. you can support the cause in many ways which wont cost you a penny. you can

spread the news about IOTrain over social media
ask your friends and relatives to support this project
if you know journalists ask them to write about IOTrain

follow us on twitter @t_jambhekar and #IOTrain
re-tweet the #IOTrain tweets

let us know about people and projects who can use IOTrain .(we will take efforts to make IOTrain to be a great experience for them)

In return to your support we are responsible not only to you but also to community
For you we will

take best of our efforts to deliver your rewards in time if not earlier.

provide defect free product and great experience.

provide you email support if you face difficulties in using IOTrain.

For Community we will

make IOTrain a evolving product
support IOTrain users to fair extent (IOTrain is open source so some users may not be our customers)
continuously learn through the process and make life of hardware tinkerers easier.
create more such products.(we are lined up with other ideas)

Rewards
IOTrain (pin header)

IOTrain (screw term)

How your money will get utilized


To manufacture additional prototype run with double layer PCB
Make large orders for production and bring price down
To build automated test equipment for quality check
Documentation, example codes etc.
Working on half a dozen related ideas we have.

Risks and challenges
As with any project, there are risks and challenges with this project as well. First of all, we’re still not finished with our product. That means some issues may still arise, though unlikely.
Moreover, testing and setting up manufacturing process takes time. unforeseen causes might delay the process to some extent.
As far as prices are concerned we have taken in to account the extra costs to cover manufacturing risks.",9.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Kya and I am from Greensboro, North Carolina.  I have never been a fan of exercising, but after working one of the most stressful jobs there is (I am not kidding we are like number 2 of the most stressful jobs based on lengthy research...lol) A few years ago I decided to start running. It was like a breath of fresh air and such a great stress reliever.</p>
<p>I ran around the neighborhood for a couple of years and then last year stepped outside my comfort zone and ran my first 5k. What an awesome feeling to complete a race, and I ran the whole way fyi (pats self on the back) Well, I have recently decided to run a 10k  and what I realized is that running is a lot better, easier, as a woman, safer, and just more enjoyable when you are doing it with more than one person.</p>
<p>That is when I started looking for running buddies and then running groups around the area. What happened next was, I said"" there has to be a better way to find running groups around where a person lives"", and that is when I  came up with this idea for   an app to assist in this aspect. This will not be the only thing the app does by the way...lol, there will also be several other cool features that will be added as well that I am really excited to hopefully share in a second fund raising quest...lol! Some of the other features will aid in motivating the running groups and also to hopefully get additional people to run with the running groups, or even form their own.  So, I have the business plan and I have the developers to begin, but I need to rasie some funds to help me get this idea jumpstarted.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Most of you are probably going ummmm, developing an app costs waaayy more than $2500.00 lady...lol!! I know, the funding I am initially requesting here is to get the legal stuff and protection out of the way. The $2500.00 will be used for:</p>
<p>1.  to incorporate the business,</p>
<p>2.   develop a logo through 99designs.com (which is a really cool concept site where you host a contest to have hundreds of people compete for you to choose their logo, and then you pay them for their idea, kind of paying it forward)</p>
<p>3. Create a website to initiate marketing and buzz for the app</p>
<p>4. Lastly for copyright protection</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am really excited about the motivation factor my app will present once it is established. I tend to believe it is a tiny step in helping America get fit, and healthy, and have some fun while doing it. Hey why not?</p>

<p><strong>Are you tired of all this??</strong></p>
<p>Well I am. Every time I walk home I just have four blocks on the subway and sometimes I just can't listen to even one song. And all this because I can’t remember if some songs have long intros, which is human. You should check your phone pulling it out of the pockets; but when you are in cold weather will you feel like undressing again to find your phone somewhere in your pockets?</p>

<p><em>(I like Pink Floyd, but have you ever tried to go jogging with them?)</em></p>
<p> <strong>So?</strong></p>
<p> So what? I am creating an app for that! The goal is to create an app that automatically cuts off the silence before the beginning of the song and permits you to enjoy the music without freaking out every three minutes. How? The app will be created to select the whole library or only certain songs and let your default player to skip the first point and go straight to the point. I am thinking about a simple application that would be sold for less than five dollars. I would pay five dollars, just in case. And I bet you too.</p>
<p><strong>Less than five dollars, eh? How much?</strong></p>
<p>I like to talk straight. These are the prices I had in mind:</p>
<p>-          Free for lite version in AppStore, Android and Cydia (100 songs)</p>
<p>-          3,99 $ for Appstore</p>
<p>-          4,99 $ for Android and Cydia</p>
<p>-          4,99 $ for Google Chrome Store</p>
<p>If you fund the app with any cash offer, you will always have these prices. Never more, but never less.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Even one dollar gets all us closer.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why AppStore more than Cydia and Android?</strong></p>
<p>This will be the fist app ever to appear both on AppStore, Amazon, Android Store and Cydia Store. Why AppStore and Cydia together? Let me explain:</p>
<p>Apple has a dedicated mp3 player, the iPod, which cannot be modified by any software. In order to remove the silence automatically to the songs we will have to interact with the iPod app. We don’t want to do anything illegal, so no default player for Apple. We will gift you our player, and as long as you will use it you will enjoy the majesty of our app.</p>

<p>I am a 24 yo intern, and probably I will go on for a long time like this but I like what I do. And I am fond enough of technology to know that small things make life better. Like this app, less than five dollars for it seems a reasonable price.</p>
<p>The money I would need is for hardwares and softwares, and they will be spent to pay the people I will hire to create the app I am trying to obtain a trademark for. And trademarks cost money too, like internet webpages, developers account and so on.</p>
<p>If a company comes here and steals my idea because I don't have a trademark? Well I can do nothing. Without money there is not much I can do. But I have many ideas. I hope I could use this money to finance also other inventions, mostly using trademarks, which I told you, cost a lot. </p>

<h3>CrowdSignals.io: Building a Community Dataset</h3>
<p>   CrowdSignals.io is organized and run by AlgoSnap, a bootstrapped start-up in Seattle with roots in the research community. The project is advised by top experts in academia and industry. With your support, we will create the largest set of smartphone and smartwatch data available to the community. The dataset will include anonymized place, sensor, social, system, and interaction logs as well as user-provided ground truth labels and survey feedback. The data will be collected from a demographically diverse pool of volunteer Android users across the United States.</p>
<p>   <u>We will not profit from this dataset</u> - all funds raised will contribute directly to the data collection effort, this includes compensation for AlgoSnap staff as well as for volunteers who consent to share their anonymized data. The data will not be sold or otherwise used to generate revenue outside of this crowdfunding campaign. Furthermore, 12-18 months after we share data with Contributors we will make the data available to academic researchers for free.</p>
<p>   We will use best practices in recruiting, on-boarding, and working with volunteers. For volunteers, this means informed consent and the ability to opt-out or delete any data at any time. For Backers, this means an agreement to commit to ethical use of the data (e.g., no onward transfer, no reverse engineering) as well as some transparency regarding how you will use the data.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<b>Smartphones and Smartwatches:</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">   We're collecting data primarily from smartphones and will include smartwatch data for volunteers that own a smartwatch. If Backers vote to collect Interval Labels (see Ground Truth Labels below) for scripted physical activities with a significant manual component (e.g., washing hands) then we will do our best to ensure that smartwatch data is collected from 30 volunteers.<br/><br/></span>

<b>Security and Anonymization</b><br/>   All data will be encrypted, securely transmitted, and subject to strong anonymization. In particular, all unique IDs (e.g., contacts, MAC, SSID, Cell ID) will be hashed on device and replaced with a simple identifier (e.g., ""Contact 426"") in post-processing.  Geo-location data will be mined to extract a log of places visited and then destroyed after volunteers provide semantic labels for each place (e.g., ""Italian Restaurant"").  App usage logs may be semantically fuzzed. For example, the exact name of an app may be replaced with a descriptive category (e.g., ""game"").
<br/><br/><p>   This approach to anonymization may limit the utility of the data for some research. However, we feel this level of anonymization is appropriate for a shared dataset.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Use of Funds</h3>
<p></p>
<p>   By far the most expensive component of a data collection campaign is the development of a software platform and legal framework - we've already done that! We'll apply funds to the remaining costs:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""><b>Paying volunteers: </b>we'll pay volunteers for the data they contribute + additional bonus payments for every ground truth label they provide.<br/></span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""><b>Paying staff:</b> We will pay staff to recruit, train, and manage volunteers as well as to post-process the data (e.g., insights, anonymization).<br/><br/></span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""><b>Paying for cloud services:</b> We may incur some fees when transmitting the data to Backers.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div><p><b><br/></b></p></div>
<div>
<p></p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p></p>
<div><b>Our goal of $15,000 will allow us to:</b></div>
<div><ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Collect 5-10+ examples per volunteer for each of 5 Backer-selected ground truth labels</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Guarantee smartwatch (in addition to smartphone) data for 3 or more labels</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Collect, anonymize, and share 30 days of data from 30 volunteers</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Collect Demographics, Place, and Contact labels</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Share code samples</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Share educational materials including the basic CrowdSignals.io app</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Create the CrowdSignals.io community profile pages and blog<br/><br/></span></li>
</ul></div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're confident that we'll achieve the funding needed to collect an excellent dataset. There are a few risks and challenges which we address here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>A lack of volunteers with smartwatches</b><br/>In this case we'll recruit additional volunteers and collect ground truth labels in a scripted fashion using smartwatches we provide.</li>
</ul>

CrowdSignals.io: Building a Community Dataset
   CrowdSignals.io is organized and run by AlgoSnap, a bootstrapped start-up in Seattle with roots in the research community. The project is advised by top experts in academia and industry. With your support, we will create the largest set of smartphone and smartwatch data available to the community. The dataset will include anonymized place, sensor, social, system, and interaction logs as well as user-provided ground truth labels and survey feedback. The data will be collected from a demographically diverse pool of volunteer Android users across the United States.
   We will not profit from this dataset - all funds raised will contribute directly to the data collection effort, this includes compensation for AlgoSnap staff as well as for volunteers who consent to share their anonymized data. The data will not be sold or otherwise used to generate revenue outside of this crowdfunding campaign. Furthermore, 12-18 months after we share data with Contributors we will make the data available to academic researchers for free.
   We will use best practices in recruiting, on-boarding, and working with volunteers. For volunteers, this means informed consent and the ability to opt-out or delete any data at any time. For Backers, this means an agreement to commit to ethical use of the data (e.g., no onward transfer, no reverse engineering) as well as some transparency regarding how you will use the data.


CrowdSignals.io Community: Advisers and Experts
We've been fortunate to receive feedback and advice from  hundreds of experts in academia and industry. Several have agreed to advise CrowdSignals.io: 

Henry Tirri (Aalto University)
Deborah Estrin (Cornell)
Jason Hong (CMU)

Andrew Campbell (Dartmouth).

The Data

   We're collecting numerous concurrent data streams and will leverage the increasing prominence of Sensor Hub Technology to capture rich, high-frequency sensor data for long periods of time.    See our data types and anonymization doc (pdf) for details, or check out our free data sample: http://crowdsignals.io/sample-dataset.html-- Note that this data sample is not anonymized.


List of Data Types (includes smartphone and smartwatch):

Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Uncalibrated Gyroscope, Magnetometer, Uncalibrated Magnetometer, Heart Rate, Temperature, Light, Pressure, Humidity, Proximity, Bluetooth, GSM, WLAN, Semantic place names and categories (e.g., ""Home"", ""Restaurant - Italian""), Contacts, Call and SMS log Headers, Battery, Connectivity, Networking, App Usage, Camera Usage, Media Consumption, Phone Status, Ringer State, Screen State, Configuration







Smartphones and Smartwatches:   We're collecting data primarily from smartphones and will include smartwatch data for volunteers that own a smartwatch. If Backers vote to collect Interval Labels (see Ground Truth Labels below) for scripted physical activities with a significant manual component (e.g., washing hands) then we will do our best to ensure that smartwatch data is collected from 30 volunteers.



Security and Anonymization   All data will be encrypted, securely transmitted, and subject to strong anonymization. In particular, all unique IDs (e.g., contacts, MAC, SSID, Cell ID) will be hashed on device and replaced with a simple identifier (e.g., ""Contact 426"") in post-processing.  Geo-location data will be mined to extract a log of places visited and then destroyed after volunteers provide semantic labels for each place (e.g., ""Italian Restaurant"").  App usage logs may be semantically fuzzed. For example, the exact name of an app may be replaced with a descriptive category (e.g., ""game"").
   This approach to anonymization may limit the utility of the data for some research. However, we feel this level of anonymization is appropriate for a shared dataset.




Ground Truth Labels 

We collect several categories of ground truth from volunteers:



Demographic Surveys: basic info such as age range, sex, and education.


Place Labels: names for places visited (e.g., ""Home"", ""Italian Restaurant"")


Contact Labels: relationship to a each contact (e.g., ""Spouse"", ""Co-worker"").


Interval Labels: precise start and end times that correspond to a particular activity or phenomenon (e.g., ""washing hands"", ""sit-ups"", ""searching for an Italian restaurant"")


Point Labels: a volunteer's state at a single point in time (e.g., ""happy"", ""arrived by bus"", ""eating""). Solicited at random times as in Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), or provided at will by volunteers.


Proposed Labels (5/10)
As of 5/10, campaign contributors have proposed the following labels for data collection.  If you have more candidate labels to propose, please send them to us at organizers@crowdsignals.io! In May we'll review together and decide how many (if not all) labels we can capture and include in the dataset.



Device Usage: Information seeking behavior (e.g., find an Italian restaurant)

Environmental: Indoors / Outdoors, How many people are in current place

Wellbeing: Mood, Physical Wellbeing, provided periodically with point labels

Physical Activities: Elevator up/down, escalator up/down

Daily Life: Eating, sedentary behaviors (e.g., watching TV)

Situational: Phone position (e.g., in pocket, in purse, in hand, on table)


Transportation: Driving, Parking, Riding public transit


Proposing and Voting on Labels
   Demographic Surveys, Place, and Contact Labels will be collected from all volunteers. A set of Interval and/or Point Labels will also be collected. 



Backers at the $20 and higher levels may propose Labels to be collected.

All Backers $20 and higher will vote to decide which labels will be collected.
AlgoSnap will break tie votes and reserves the right to veto any proposed Label due to privacy, engineering, or safety constraints.

Examples of Other Popular Ground Truth Labels
   The following are examples of popular labels according to recent survey feedback:





Timeline and Plan
   We spent a year developing our software platform and legal framework. We've tested and refined it over the last few months and we're ready for Phase 1 of CrowdSignals.io!  Data will be collected from May through August and will be shared with Backers in Summer 2016.  We'll make the dataset available to academic researchers for free in Summer 2017.





July-August Plan

In July and August we will recruit and collect data from 30 volunteers before sharing collected data with campaign contributors.  More details and updates will be announced to Backers by email and on the CrowdSignals.io blog at:  http://crowdsignals.io/blog/



Use of Funds

   By far the most expensive component of a data collection campaign is the development of a software platform and legal framework - we've already done that! We'll apply funds to the remaining costs:



Paying volunteers: we'll pay volunteers for the data they contribute + additional bonus payments for every ground truth label they provide.

Paying staff: We will pay staff to recruit, train, and manage volunteers as well as to post-process the data (e.g., insights, anonymization).
Paying for cloud services: We may incur some fees when transmitting the data to Backers.





Goals

Our goal of $15,000 will allow us to:

Collect 5-10+ examples per volunteer for each of 5 Backer-selected ground truth labels
Guarantee smartwatch (in addition to smartphone) data for 3 or more labels
Collect, anonymize, and share 30 days of data from 30 volunteers
Collect Demographics, Place, and Contact labels
Share code samples
Share educational materials including the basic CrowdSignals.io app
Create the CrowdSignals.io community profile pages and blog




Risks & Challenges
We're confident that we'll achieve the funding needed to collect an excellent dataset. There are a few risks and challenges which we address here:


A lack of volunteers with smartwatchesIn this case we'll recruit additional volunteers and collect ground truth labels in a scripted fashion using smartwatches we provide.

<p>Our product is ready to use however we are still improving it. It means that our big vision has only partly been translated into product. </p>
<p>This adapter can be connected to many different devices/ toys which are working with 5 V- 15 V DC power supply.  You are switching it on and off by means of the brainwaves signals (alpha: relaxation, beta: concentration) measured by neurofeedback headset. <br/></p>

<br/>
<p>At this moment after several tests the prototype of our adapter is working properly with following items:</p>

About our invention



Our product is ready to use however we are still improving it. It means that our big vision has only partly been translated into product. 
This adapter can be connected to many different devices/ toys which are working with 5 V- 15 V DC power supply.  You are switching it on and off by means of the brainwaves signals (alpha: relaxation, beta: concentration) measured by neurofeedback headset. 


         


At this moment after several tests the prototype of our adapter is working properly with following items:
1) Slot car race track ""Carrera - Evolution Turbo Drift"". Cars are racing faster or slower it depends accordingly of the level of concentration or relaxation.
2) Automatic Floor Dusting “Virobi RoboMop”. Robot is switching on after the intended LoC (Level of Concentration) or LoR (Level of Relaxation) was achieved, and turning off when your brainwaves are below Loc/LoR.
3) LED panel 12V. Diodes are functioning in two ways: brightness of light can be controlled – if you are concentrated they are lighting brighter and the second way is: switching on after the intended LoC or LoR was achieved, and turning off when your brainwaves are below Loc/LoR.
LoC/LoR can be changed smoothly, to use from beginners to advanced skilled users.
Most important information eg. your current concentration/meditation, headset signal quality will be displayed on build-in OLED screen

Children



Many of attempts at making a play for children both educational and fun end up being neither.
                                           
         


Are you helping your child to understand that some things are not fun or interesting but we have to do it anyway because there is no other way to learn? Your child is collecting the less-than-interesting tasks, mostly boring, because later come the time to enjoy. 
You don’t have to split the tasks up into groups of boring learning and funny playing.
In the fact one of the keys to concentration is genuine interest in a subject. Something what is boring can’t let us concentrate enough long. On the other hand something what is new and not familiar doesn’t hold our concentration.
Our invention makes a subtle balance between this two – familiarity and novelty. It forces a child to concentrate so the car keep going. If the concentration increase, the car is moving faster! It is not to easy that you become bored and not to hard to feel unable to concentrate!

 People with disabilities
Some disabilities are excluding people from everyday life activities. Many of physically inactive people need help with the day-to-day tasks, such as doing everyday housework for example. Although there are organizations providing the help or family is taking the primary role as caregiver, there is still possibility that the tasks with which an individual requires assistance can be done with help of some home appliances adjusted to our adapter.  


      




The activities of daily living discussed here include tasks of basic care or simple physical needs, so the usage of our adapter can increase the quality of everyday life. This facilitate than lees active engagement or assistance from caregiver to disabled person. Mostly the help is asked in daily life activities as dusting, tiding up, moving inside residence, shopping for groceries, washing, dressing or taking medication. If we enable to do only some of this activities with help of brainwave signals going through our device it will revolutionize theirs life.

Concentration training       
Does your child need better focus? You have already tried to achieve this by many solutions like reducing sugar intake, increasing protein levels, giving sufficient sleep, removing distractions at home, creating the mood for concentration with calming music or removing fluorescent lights?


     
                                                                                 
Figure it out! The extensive practice allows for the pathways of concentration! There is no better moment for your child to exercise this than time of having fun.
Active children focus better! You know it yourself the best that to accomplish any task you need to concentrate your attention. It is hard enough for you to be able to focus for a time! You can meditate or study the techniques for improving focus and concentration. How to share your knowledge with a child?  The best way to achieve this is to play together.
You are not only showing your kids that the game is fun - but most important -  you are letting them decide that concentration itself is really cool! We are nor going from the place that learning is unpleasant. The requirement for learning is concentration. This is how to improve  concentration without forcing your child to stay in one place long enough focusing and following the instructions.

Relaxation background     
There is no doubt that everyone no more or less is struggling with stress. Even our children are not free of its influence. The key to long and pleasant life is to avoid worries, tension and stress. However there are so many tasks to accomplish and so little time to relax. How to find enough time to reduce stress, transform the way you live in a positive way without quitting everything at the same moment? 
    

    
                      
You can try by doing some of your activities with help of our technology. Because relaxation is one of required condition to move the objects which are driven by the power of our mind. You can be calmed by housework. This helps you train the meditation state. Pleasant chore – we can say! 
For a child this is a real advantage too. It is not so easy to get a child to do something what is having noting to do with fun and play. Here is another level coming to game. Relaxation is necessary in the play!

Usually within the scope of many question there is this common one: “What will I get from it?”


    

The answer is - You will know you better! Aren’t you curious how your mind is working? You can not only know the function of your brain but train it to higher achievements. 



Besides you have opportunity to reduce stress in you life. You can do this through the play with children. They are taking your mind off stressful things and during the play you are using concentration and relaxation. 
Finally, you are participating in developing process of our technology. We encourage you to give us any feedback, which help us make this adapter matching various needs.                   
“Goals are dreams with deadlineWe need 553 000 USD to develop our technology and start in the future commercial manufacturing (by saving he highest quality of our merchandise).  Our interest is to introduce new advanced technology, which make it possible to control various devices with brainwave signals more precisely. Components for development like this are obviously more expensive so the production costs are increasing in proportion. We want to provide our project in best tools to construct electronic elements we need. This are then the main costs for now.


     


In next 2-3 years we want to focus on other application for technology based on the brainwave signals. We undertake an experimental projects not only for education or entertainment but also for supporting by treatment of neurological diseases or moving disabilities. To the best of our technology, our work is combining the existing devices with adapter which can move this objects by using brainwave signals. 

Even if we only approach but don’t achieve our goal, we wont stop our work. Motivated by all achievements up to now we will test various electronic devices, capture the brainwave signals and perform the universal adapter, which will educate, train, entertain, assist and help in everyday life. Finally, if we raise less money that our goal is, we start our work with the plan only customizing the timeline for it. 
                                
           

Keep calm! Our team is awesome!

As a team we are committed to being among the best inventors is how we support and improve the product we build. We try o be transparent about our developing process and our strategy. We believe that this helps us to attract yours attention and receive your opinion. And also because we want to involve you in what we create.


Support our team and help us make this technology better! Our invention is unique and so our perks are too. We hope that you will like it!

Risk &challenges                    
 We think that trying something new often requires courage and is itself the benefit. Trying something new forces us to grow and this growth seems to require we take a new action first. This adopting a new attitude and also a new way of thinking. We are confronting challenges by taking a risks. We are aware of our imperfection but “man errs as long as he doth strive”. Here are some questions we asked our self trying to improve this project.

                                                    

Q: Is this early bird product free from technical problems?
A:  The newly discovered technology has always its weaknesses but we are testing our adapter all the time. Many of questions, yours questions, which we are expecting after release should help us to solve this problems.
Q: Not everyone has the same power in concentration. What if my child can’t concentrate enough to move the car?
A: Our adapter has potentiometer which let you reduce threshold of concentration or relaxation. 
Q: How can I know if this adapter will be compatible with my device, so it can work?
A: We are still updating a list with items and devices which are working together with our adapter. Concerning both headphones and receiving sets like car racing track.
Please do not hesitate to contact us when you have other question to ask: contact@crystalwaves.com

<p>Developing sex tech is complicated. Traditional sex toys can go from

months and sometimes years to develop.</p>
<p>Unlike
most Indiegogo product launches, we have fully tested these products. We are
not looking for money to complete the project- we are looking for early bird
users to give us feedback and suggestions on our app. We have already paid for
tooling and taken care of all other upfront costs in order to take this to the
production phase. </p>
<p>We
will be doing final quality control testing before sending out units to early
birds. It is possible that a problem with the hardware may be found during this
final testing period. In our project timeline, we’ve already taken into account
that there may be adjustments. Adjustments may delay shipment, but the delays
shouldn’t be very long. We have great relationships with our suppliers and
shipping partners. We also take care of the majority of the manufacturing
process ourselves- enabling us to allocate additional resources to speed things
up if necessary!</p>

Enjoy 18:9 aspect ratios @ 2160x1080 resolution for enhanced HD viewing of all your favorite games, movies, and television!The 6-inch screen in the Kung K1 provides 8% more viewing area than the iPhone 8. This allows for smartphone gaming which is truly an experience unlike any other – the things you’ll see, the things you’ll do – it will truly transport you to another world. The Kung K1 takes these experiences and launches them into the stratosphere – making them the de facto way to experience the best that gaming has to offer. Without this amazing screen, you are truly doing yourself, and the games that you’re playing, a major disservice.The Kung K1 features the blazing Helio X30 by Mediatek: A unique 10-core design featuring the ARM Cortex-A73 (up to 2.6GHz). (For comparison: Apple’s latest A11 is a 6-core design with maximum clock speed of 2.39GHz.)MediaTek’s Helio X30 is among the first wave of 10nm smartphone chipsets that will be available to the market, and the only smartphone SoC to use 10 nanometer (nm) fabrication in creation of 10 cored (Deca-core) smartphone with 4G LTE-Advanced WorldMode modem that uses 3x Carrier Aggregation with performance of 450MBit/s. Taken together, this technology triumvirate gives manufacturers greater flexibility in designing halo smartphones that provide an outstanding, high endurance user experience.Featuring the ultra-powerful Sony IMX 386 dual-lens camera, even the most demanding photography situations can be tackled with ease.Using our special noise-reduction algorithms, the Kung K1 has the ability to shoot in low-light with the most pristine of results:  We wanted our users to have capabilities of a DSLR in their hand for easy access. We painstakingly created a “depth-of-field” mode which includes 85 different presets to help you get professional-grade portraits and close-ups that are photo-journal ready!The 4500 mAh battery in the Kung K1 is 40% larger than the iPhone X. This allows you non-stop access during even your most high-performance computing needs.These days, battery life is more important than ever, thanks to the big screens, super fast processors and demanding apps we find on the latest phones. After all, what good is that advanced camera or high-resolution display if your handset is dead before the sun goes down?During our battery test, where we turn the screen up to full brightness and play a 90-minute Full HD video clip, the KUNG K1 only lost 10% of its charge. That's noticeably better than the Samsung Galaxy S8, which lost 19%.There’s fast-charging tech here  which means you’ll be able to pump some juice into your phone very quickly if you need to. The Kung K1 focuses on key performance metrics, whilst minimizing unneeded costs. Not only is its performance best-in-class, it achieve this at a fraction of the cost of other phones in the marketplace.Technology always comes at a price, but the question is whether that price is going to be high or low. It’s easy to fall in love with the latest high-end smartphone, but sometimes our budgets demand a more prudent purchase. With the Kung K1, now you can enjoy the benefits of a premium smartphone and leave some cash in your wallet at the same time. We are proud of what we have created to date but need your help to push it over the line. By supporting us, you will be part of reinventing the smartphone product category, which we feel is so lacking in the market at present.

We cannot control this additional charge, and it will be the backers responsibility to cover once they receive the selected reward. Any questions regarding this additional charge should be addressed directly with the backers customs office.
 Because of our dedication to the vision of ohsnap, the ohsnap grip went through multiple iterations and 3D-printed prototypes every day. It constantly changed and improved on a daily basis to bring it to the slick and easy to handle grip that you see today.DimensionsOhsnap is 61mm in diameter & 3mm thick",29.0,4,"2 Campaigns

<h3>
<br/>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>I am a graphic designer by trade, and my uncle Randy is in the manufacturing business.  We have been interested in trying new business ideas using my talents for design together with Randy’s engineering team and manufacturing capabilities. I started a small company called iCoreGear because of my passion for Apple's products, and wanted to design my own equipment to complement its great devices. Smartphones are everywhere now, and an important part of our daily lives. The CrystalCore TiltDock is designed to serve as much more than a charging station, but also as a ""home"" for your smartphone, tablet or other device. Its features as described below are unique and groundbreaking, as there is no other dock out there as useful and sleek. <br/><br/><strong>Meet the manufacturer for our product:</strong> <a href=""http://www.world-trading.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Sino Sales &amp; Support"">www.world-trading.com</a></p>
<p><em><img alt=""3 Versions of CrystalCore TiltDock"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.applecoregear.com/img2/docks_close_indiegogo.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""CrystalCore TiltDock""/></em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The CrystalCore TiltDock</h3>
<p>We have built 3 versions of the dock to satisfy users of all types of smartphones and devices.  Apple's 30-pin connector (compatible with the iPhone 4S and previous versions, the iPad and iPad 2, and all iPods with the same connector).  A Micro USB connector to make our dock work with many other smartphones and devices such as most Samsung, Nokia, Motorola, Sony Ericsson and LG products that use the micro USB connector at the center base of the phone or device, and lastly an 8-pin Lightning connector for the new generation of Apple products such as the iPhone 5, iPad Retina, iPad mini etc. but are awaiting for Apple’s MFI program to review and of course we are hoping for approval to make sure our product is legit and fully compatible.</p>
<h3>Three Great Features</h3>
<p><strong>1: Tilting backrest.</strong>  You can ensure the angle of your phone is pefect for facetime, texting or playing. Tilt goes from upright to 45<span>° angle.</span><br/><br/><img alt=""Tilt Function on the CrystalCore TiltDock"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.applecoregear.com/img2/tilt_image.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Tilt Feature""/></p>
<p><strong>2: Fit's your phone with 99% of any cover, bumper or case.</strong>  Our Patent Pending rotating connector fits them perfectly.  You no longer need to remove your protective covers to mount the dock.</p>
<p><img alt=""iPhone docked with a vanity case still fits!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.applecoregear.com/img2/case_image.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Example of iPhone docked with a case""/></p>
<p><strong>3: Look Mom, One Hand!</strong>  With our Patent Pending base, our dock stays put on the table or desk so everything you need to do with your phone can be done with one hand.  Docking, undocking, typing/texting and adjusting the back rest.  In my opinion, this is the number one best feature!</p>
<p><img alt=""Polyurethane removable adhesive base"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.applecoregear.com/img2/PU_base.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""PU removable adhesive base""/></p>
<h3>Where We Are Today</h3>
<p>This project started in March, 2012.  We have made countless sketches, several CAD designs,  and 5 hand-made prototypes.  We have built and tested all the tooling with fully finished production samples which have been tested and meet our quality requirements.  We are working on the packaging, manual and now will start the marketing.  If you’re a retailer or distributor, contact us directly for wholesale ordering. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>My uncle has financed everything up to now.  I need to raise funds that will go towards manufacturing the docks and stocking our little warehouse with inventory to sell.  Every dock you buy will be the first to get shipped so you’ll be the first to start using them.  Each order includes shipping anywhere in the lower 48 states.

Who Are We?
I am a graphic designer by trade, and my uncle Randy is in the manufacturing business.  We have been interested in trying new business ideas using my talents for design together with Randy’s engineering team and manufacturing capabilities. I started a small company called iCoreGear because of my passion for Apple's products, and wanted to design my own equipment to complement its great devices. Smartphones are everywhere now, and an important part of our daily lives. The CrystalCore TiltDock is designed to serve as much more than a charging station, but also as a ""home"" for your smartphone, tablet or other device. Its features as described below are unique and groundbreaking, as there is no other dock out there as useful and sleek. Meet the manufacturer for our product: www.world-trading.com



The CrystalCore TiltDock
We have built 3 versions of the dock to satisfy users of all types of smartphones and devices.  Apple's 30-pin connector (compatible with the iPhone 4S and previous versions, the iPad and iPad 2, and all iPods with the same connector).  A Micro USB connector to make our dock work with many other smartphones and devices such as most Samsung, Nokia, Motorola, Sony Ericsson and LG products that use the micro USB connector at the center base of the phone or device, and lastly an 8-pin Lightning connector for the new generation of Apple products such as the iPhone 5, iPad Retina, iPad mini etc. but are awaiting for Apple’s MFI program to review and of course we are hoping for approval to make sure our product is legit and fully compatible.
Three Great Features
1: Tilting backrest.  You can ensure the angle of your phone is pefect for facetime, texting or playing. Tilt goes from upright to 45° angle.
2: Fit's your phone with 99% of any cover, bumper or case.  Our Patent Pending rotating connector fits them perfectly.  You no longer need to remove your protective covers to mount the dock.

3: Look Mom, One Hand!  With our Patent Pending base, our dock stays put on the table or desk so everything you need to do with your phone can be done with one hand.  Docking, undocking, typing/texting and adjusting the back rest.  In my opinion, this is the number one best feature!

Where We Are Today
This project started in March, 2012.  We have made countless sketches, several CAD designs,  and 5 hand-made prototypes.  We have built and tested all the tooling with fully finished production samples which have been tested and meet our quality requirements.  We are working on the packaging, manual and now will start the marketing.  If you’re a retailer or distributor, contact us directly for wholesale ordering. 


What I Need
My uncle has financed everything up to now.  I need to raise funds that will go towards manufacturing the docks and stocking our little warehouse with inventory to sell.  Every dock you buy will be the first to get shipped so you’ll be the first to start using them.  Each order includes shipping anywhere in the lower 48 states. (~$8 value) Shipping outside the country will cost an additonal $14.
This dock is one of a kind. Not only is it created to work with all kinds of devices, its features are new and not found in any other dock. Finally, instead of plugging your phone in to charge and setting next to your bed you can have a real ""home"" for it within your home or office. 
We will be presenting this project along with our new CableCore Hub for the iMac 21"" (which you can see on our website) at the 2013 International CES show in Las Vegas, January 8th – 11th.  Booth #6224
Buying your dock today ensures you’ll be the first one to get our dock, and be helping me to get some extra units made for selling to others.  Your help is truly appreciated!

Together with our software, this will give you the ability to use Raspberry PI equipment with a standard PC or Mac computer.  2) Use it as an extra GPIO Header - for if you've run out of pins on the Raspberry Pi, or want to use two add-on board together. You will gain an extra Raspberry Pi header that is pin-for-pin compatible. You can even use a longer Micro USB cable to make an extension to be able to have your GPIO pins away from the pi.Along with this the RTk.GPIO Adapter is compatible with a majority Raspberry Pi Addons! You can check out the compatibility spreadsheet to see which ones.  A TrafficHAT on top of the RTk.GPIO Board Add-on not listed? Email it to us at rtkgpio@ryanteck.uk and we'll check for compatibility and update our spreadsheet.   .Here at Ryanteck we work with a few schools on using Raspberry Pi in the classroom. Along with this and the introduction of micro:bits teachers are struggling to get funding for their Raspberry Pi Clubs to get add-ons, Micro:bit add-ons and all of the usual funding!By designing this it allows schools to get a board that allows them to program it on the normal computers in the classroom for non Raspberry Pi Lessons and then move to Raspberry Pi for clubs. Best of all they can justify buying add-ons for their Raspberry Pi clubs instead of limiting them just to be used in those lessons.Along with this a lot of people's projects are usually developed on another computer. This allows you to experiment and prototype projects on your normal computer and then move over to the Raspberry Pi later on.Finally not everyone is able to use a Pi at home because it may cost too much for them to get all of the accessories required to make it work on their monitors at home. This allows people with old computers or laptops to be able to take advantage of the great Pi ecosystem and continue on it when they have access to a Raspberry Pi.   The process of how the RTk.GPIO works is quite simple and works to the end user almost identically as the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.Your ProgramThe first level is your program that you've written. Like the Raspberry Pi you use a library to control the GPIO Pins. For you its as simple as using our library instead.The LibraryThe library then interprets your commands in the same way the Raspberry Pi library does and then transmits it over USB to the RTk.GPIO BoardThe RTk.GPIO BoardFinally the RTk.GPIO board receives the message of what to do from the library and then either acts on it (Turning a GPIO On or off) or transmits information back (Such as a pin state) to the computer.Currently the only planned library is Python which will be compatible with most programs written using RPi.GPIO. We also plan to have limited GPIO Zero support & possibly Scratch GPIO.   This project is a LOT of work in both hardware and software.We have the first hardware prototype ready to go along with basic software for it. For the finished product we want to refine the hardware more and produce better functioning software.Finally to get the great price that we're selling it to you at we need to order LOTS of boards.   The money we fund-raise will help fund the following:
Prototyping & development Costs
Hardware costs for production batch.
Programming & Testing the production boards.
Software costs for basic GPIO Support
IGG & Credit Card Processor Fees
Postage & Packaging Costs

<p>PLUG was created to pack the most amount of power in the smallest form factor possible. We knew all the power in the world would be useless if you couldn’t easily carry it with you. During the development process, we tested PLUG’s size by placing it in every bag we could find. If it couldn’t fit, we went back to the drawing board. </p>

</div></div>","We already have over 100 positive reviews on our Amazon listing with a 4.7 star rating! Amazon customers and backers alike have voiced their opinion about how amazing they think PLUG is. Let us know what you think about your PLUG by leaving us a review HERE!
  





 


 


 


*Early prototype shown above, new model will have international AC outlets.
All Laptops, iPhone and Other Mobile Devices, iPad, CPAP Machines, Medical Devices, Desktop Computers, Printers, Flat Screen TVs, PS4, XBOX ONE, Wii U, Various Video Gaming Consoles, Mini Fridges, Cameras, Drones, Hoverboards and so much more!


 

With PLUG you can live life on your terms. Imagine working from the beach without having to rely on your laptop battery. How about taking a family camping trip with the convenience of electricity at your campsite? Or being able to capture those special moments in perfect clarity because you can now use studio lighting anywhere. PLUG makes all of these situations and many more a reality.
 
And hey! Since it has two outlets, why not share the power with a friend?

Why be stuck inside playing video games or watching your favorite shows? Take them outside on a nice day for even more fun. Power your gaming console and TV anywhere. 


Sometimes, you want to power your devices while PLUG is still charging. This is now possible with pass-through charging.  You can still use it just like you would use a USB hub or surge protector.  


*Early prototype shown above, new model will have international AC outlets.

PLUG was created to pack the most amount of power in the smallest form factor possible. We knew all the power in the world would be useless if you couldn’t easily carry it with you. During the development process, we tested PLUG’s size by placing it in every bag we could find. If it couldn’t fit, we went back to the drawing board. 



We used the same battery cells you’d find in a TESLA car. Chosen for their unbeatable performance and longevity, these battery cells were manufactured by Panasonic, the leader in battery technology. 


 

We wanted PLUG to not only be extremely functional, but also beautiful. PLUG is something you would be proud to take out of your bag every time, and compliments the technology you already have. 
 



This is our guarantee to you. PLUG will never be sold at a lower price than the lowest price we offered it here on Indiegogo ($199). It’s our way of thanking you for being one of the first people to support our goal of bringing portable power to the world. We’ve shipped on 100% of all previous campaigns and have the positive reviews to prove it. 
 

This is our second crowdfunding campaign. In 2014, ChargeTech introduced the world’s smallest portable power outlet. We’ve shipped thousands of units to backers all over the world and built lasting partnerships with companies such as Google, NASA, Hilton, and Toyota. We’ve heard countless stories of people powering anything, anywhere. Thanks to all your feedback and support, we are proud to bring you our most powerful unit ever. 



We're a team of dreamers, designers, engineers and problem solvers. The team is based in California, with worldwide operations in Switzerland and China. Our goal is to help the community power anything, anywhere by building life-changing products. 
 


We're the crowdfunding campaign that's powering other crowdfunding campaigns. Power your Coolest Cooler, Jibo Robot, Oculus Rift, DJI Phantom drone, Hoverboard scooter and so much more. 
 


Everyday we’re constantly tied to the wall outlet to power our devices, from our desktop computers and laptops to our tablets and cell phones. Too often we have to squeeze into uncomfortable spaces just to stay connected. Now, with PLUG, there’s a better way. Break away from the wall outlet.
 


 
We’ve worked extensively with our manufacturers to ensure they’re ready to move ahead at full steam once we place our initial order. All we need is your support to begin mass producing units of PLUG.

<div>
<p>I believe it is a long shot to do crowdfunding for Baha'i related software projects, but so is the simple act of creating Baha'i related software. In the future we will find a native Baha'i calendar in every device, we will find a native digital Baha'i library implemented to ""spotlight"" and the like. <br/>So why not start exploring technology today? Why not think out of the box and start creating the software of tomorrow? </p>
<p>""One Ocean"" is not about competing with printed Books. It is not about competing with eBooks. It is about thinking out of the box, how can our smartphone be of service to us? </p>
<p>It is hard to really deliver this vision of Baha'i software, because it is new. I can not tell you what the future looks like, but we can dream together. I can tell you my dream:</p>
<p>You sit in a Ruhi Book 1 study circle, you see this beautiful quotation and you wonder: ""Where is it from?"" </p>
<p>Now you can go to the end of the book and find the references or you can take out your smartphone, open One Ocean, and hold your camera over the quotation. After 2 seconds you will see the text merge into the digital page of the digital book in the Apps library. You can now safe this quotation as a favourite or place a bookmark or simply start reading the full context of this quote.</p>
<p>One Ocean can't do this yet, my App is in its baby phase, i only just completed the basic structure but i can tell you on thing. This is only one minor vision i have for what Baha'i software should be like. </p>
<p>The Sacred Writings should always and ever be in the centre, the technology should be around the Writings and not the other way. </p>
<p>I love dreaming of the future of Baha'i related software, i'd love for you to dream with me and i'd love nothing more for this dream to come alive.</p>
<p>That's why i created this crowdfunding campaign:</p>
<p>Share this campaign if you believe it is possible to transform the way we understand technology, because it is!</p>
<p>Much Baha'i love </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>One Ocean is a digital Baha'i Library for iPhone and iPad and was created with he aim to inspire the Baha'i World to create beautiful Baha'i related software and make use of our modern technology in a new and innovative way.</p>
<p>One Ocean is about beautiful presentation that always has the sacred writings in the center. You can create your own collection of Quotations with the included smart reference feature and share entire collections via sms or email. </p>
<p>The name is a tribute to the great Ocean software we all love, at the time i released this App Ocean was seemingly discontinued and i wanted to show my appreciation with this new App. ""One"" because it is decentralised and in everyones pocket. You create your own Ocean by collecting quotes in your custom categories. So everyone has ""One Ocean"".</p>

<p>The short explanation for why we deliver 4X the resolution is all because of the optics. On VR, the content is splitted in two, one picture for each eye. So, even a smartphone with a resolution of 1920x 1080, will only provide 960x 1080. But then the aspect ratio is completely off. In order to keep the aspect ratio (usually 16:9 for most 2D-content), the image has to be shrunk (as shown below to the left) to ~960x540, which turns into 1/4 of the smartphones original resolution. With MagiMask however, we're able to give you the full resolution (picture to the right). </p>

<p><strong>Why</strong></p>
<p>Augmented reality reveals a new world of possibilities and now is the time to join - creating the standards of our new reality. With MagiMask and MagiTools we are giving you the starting point to unleash your creativity and participate in a passionate community. By using this platform, you can be sure that there will be people using your creations in AR, and that we together can shape the future of digital interactions.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong></p>
<p>The MagiTools are specially designed to make the transition between our reality and augmented reality as natural as possible. Reaching out to get to know more about an object is an ultimate path of least resistance, thus letting the user to immerse themselves in your experience. The patterns of MagiTools have been optimised through several iterations to be best understood by the image recognition software. We will also give all the developers access to our code in order to enable easy interactions with the MagiTools, e.g. by using the dice as a controller, and so forth.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>The team is fully devoted to making MagiMask a success, but we are of course aware that there are risks connected with creating something completely new. We are a team of second time Indiegogo-creators (first product was called MovieMask, with an older generation version of the same optical principle). We have shipped thousands of products to over 70 countries - where around 98% was delivered on time (and the last 2% was delayed in the mail due to peak Christmas season last year). We feel confident that we can deliver to you on time this campaign as well and understand the frustration that can arise when projects don’t deliver on time. <br/><br/>Even though we have a functional prototype now with close to finished aesthetics, our american Quality Control-partner has not yet finished their report on the MagiMask. If they require different processes in the manufacturing that our production partner offers, this could lead to delay or, worst case scenario, the MagiMask as of today is not fit for mass-production. <br/><br/>The software that we are developing in-house and in collaboration with 3rd party developers are to be considered as demoes until we have an app on the iOS and Play store. Nonetheless, we will work on making a comprehensive list of all existing apps that can be downloaded at the time of receiving the product.</p>
<p>Last time we also got a lot of questions regarding customs. As of October 16th 2018, backers from USA and many other countries pay no customs for our price point, but other countries does. Please check out your local custom rules is this is important to you as we will not pay this.</p>
<p>We have also heard and spoken with Kickstarter-campaigns that were more successful than our funding goal, reached them, but still got troubles due to the logistics. From our interviews, this includes unreliable business partners, miscalculating costs and setting out a distribution system that is not fit for the scale of the demand. We plan to use the same production partners, quality control partners and logistics partners as we have used before and believe this will reduce the risk compared to first-time business relationships. </p>

And you may easily customize Count Down Timer, Over-Current Protection, and Charging Completion parameter values via App setting change.</p><p>With App running on a Android or iPhone, GardCharghe also provides Power Measurement info right on the App for you to monitor the on-going real-time voltage, current, power information in Meter Mode &amp; Graph Mode so that you may  observe and understand better about the overall battery charging system’s health characteristics.</p><p>And GardCharge can do more!  GardCharge may also be used as a “smart device enabler” for your dumb USB Adaptor or other dumb USB devices (such as an always-on USB LED Light or Fan) to make these dumb devices Smart with Smart Phone Control in no time.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513083325/qedxwnxac21rkxb8xckg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">Smart Charger</font></font></strong></p><div>

<li>When detected over-current (with default value of 4A), GardCharge will cut off the Power/Current supplied to the USB Cable.</li>
<li>When detected that the Charging Device (such as a smart phone) stopped accepting Current when it is fully charged, GardCharge will provide further insurance by cutting off the Power/Current supplied to the USB Cable.</li>
<li>When detected that the Charging Device (such as a smart phone) is accepting very little Current to pass through (this indicates that the Charging Device is approaching fully charged stage), GardCharge will cut off the Power/Current supplied to the USB Cable after a certain Off Set /Delay Time.</li>
<li>When detected that the Count Down Timer used reached the end, GardCharge will cut off the Power/Current supplied to the USB Cable.</li>
</ol><p> </p><p><strong>FAQ #005:  What is the manufacturer’s default setting ?</strong></p><p>GardCharge’s factory default setting as follows:</p><ol>
<li>Count Down Timer at 6 Hour (enough charging time to cover most Smart Phones and Pads of 10” or less).</li>
<li>Over-Current Limit at 4A (enough to cover normal 0.5A ~ 1.0A ~ 2.1A ~ 2.4A current range).</li>
<li>Low Current Limit ENABLEd (for automatic charging mode) and set at 0.3A, and with Additional Time Off Set to 30min (enough to keep most smart phones or power banks’ charging to 95% ~ 100%)</li>
</ol><p> </p><p><strong>FAQ #006:  Will GardCharge work with QC2.0/3.0 charging?</strong></p><p>Yes. GardCharge provides Power/Current pass-through from Power Adapter to a charging device (such as a smart phone) via connected USB cable, and with Measurement Range of 3.6VDC ~ 21VDC and 0A ~ 3.5A covering the range of QC2.0/3.0 charging.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FAQ #007:  What is Over Current Protection?</strong></p><p>Normally your smart phones or power banks will accept Current value of 0.5A ~ 2.1A, and for some special devices with 3A, when charging.</p><p>Sometimes due to sudden misbehavior of the physical Power Adapter, USB Cable, or Smart Phone (like Power Surge); there might be an in-rush of higher than normal Current, which we call “Over Current”.  And we have Over Current Protection with the default value set at 4A as the threshold; while, pending your need, adjustable to 0.1A ~ 4A via App; and GardCharge will automatically cut off the Power/Current supplied to the USB Cable (and thus, cut off the Power/Current to the attached smart phone or power bank) to protect your charging device.</p><p>So, Over Current Protection is like having a FUSE or Circuit Breaker to protect your Charging Device.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FAQ #008:  What is Low Current Limit ?</strong></p><p>With Low Current Limit ENABLEd (as a default for the manufacturer setting), GardCharge will automatically activate intelligent algorithms to auto detect whether you have plugged-in or unplugged a charging device (such as a smart phone), and to start charging (with a fresh new cycle per your last setting) or to stop charging accordingly.</p><p>In Essense, it is placing GardCharge in automatic charging mode.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FAQ #009:  How does Low Current Limit work?</strong></p><p>* We recommend that you keep the default value for Low Current Limit with 0.3A, and with Additional Time Off Set at 30min for normal daily use (same as the factory default setting). </p><p>And the way the Low Current Limit work is that when a charging device (like a smart phone) is reaching near fully charged state, the Current going through (and supplied to the charging device) will get slower, and thus, with lower real time current sensing/detection value; and when the current value reached below 0.3A threshold (or any other value between 0.05A ~ 0.5A for the threshold set via App), GardCharge will continue charging for additional 30min for the Time Off Set (or you may set with other Time value between 0min ~ 60min) to ensure that enough additional Power/Current is charged after reaching the Low Current Threshold.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FAQ #010:  Can GardCharge work as a Mechanical Timer ?</strong></p><p>Yes.  By selecting DISABLE for the Low Current Limit within the Set Up configuration in the App, GardCharge will work as a Mechanical Count Down Timer (with Power always ON until count down to 0 min &amp; sec); and will re-initiate the count down time whenever the RESET button is pressed.</p><p>Note in this Mode, you will not be in automatic charging mode, and will not have the auto sensing/detection of plugging or unplugging the USB Cable when charging mentioned in FAQ #008.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FAQ #011:  Can GardCharge be used for Smart Watch charging?</strong></p><p>Yes.  Please set the GardCharge as a Mechanical Timer per FAQ #010 by DISABLEing the Low Current Limit; and set the Count Down Timer to, say, 30min ~ 1Hour pending your Smart Watch charging time requirement.</p><p>This is due to Smart Watch uses very little Power/Current when charging, and sometimes lower than the lower bound limit of the Low Current Limit of 0.05A; so that the Low Current Limit may not suitable to use here for the auto Current detection.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FAQ #012:  When to use Mechanical Timer mode?</strong></p><p>Other than charging Smart Watch mentioned within FAQ #011, you may need to run Mechanical Timer mode for devices with very low charging current (for charging current less than, say, 0.3A), or for devices normally running with very low current (say, less than 0.3A; such as USB LED Night-Light) or devices with unstable current (such as USB Fan with current running dynamically between 0A ~ 0.5A).</p><p>And of course, you may just use Mechanical Timer mode as you feel appropriate.  You will still have the benefit of Over Current Protection, but just keep in mind that Power/Current will be supplied until Count Down Timer reached the end.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FAQ #013:  How to wireless connect GardCharge with App?</strong></p><p>First search and install “GardCharge” App on your iPhone or Android Phone from Apple iOS App Store or Google Play Store respectively.</p><p>Then enable Bluetooth in your smart phone Set Up (if Bluetooth is not yet enabled); and run the App to proceed for the connection process. And make sure that GardCharge device is connect to your Power Adapter and with green-light ON.</p><p>For iOS, press the Search-Magnifier icon on the Upper Right corner of the App, and you will see GardCharge device icon with alpha-numeric ID name shown on screen (and if you have more than one GardCharge device, you will see more than one device icon on screen).  Press and select the appropriate GardCharge device icon to connect.</p><p>For Android, press the Menu Selection on the Upper Left, then select “Scan/Connect”, and you will see GardCharge device’s alpha-numeric ID name shown on screen (and if you have more than one GardCharge devce, you will see more than one device ID on the screen list).  Press and select the appropriate GardCharge device ID to connect.</p><p>Note, for a small percentage of Android phone, it may take a little longer to Scan (may take 5 sec ~ 30 sec).  And if a GardCharge device is ON and nearby, but you cannot see the device ID on App screen list, please press the “SCAN” on the upper-right corner of the App to re-scan.  And if you still have Scan problem, please remove GardCharge App from your Android Phone’s background task, and you may need to restart your Android Phone, then proceed for the Scan process again.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FAQ #014:  Can you charge less than 100% ?</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p>Some Smart Phone users may prefer charging the Phone with less than 100% fully charged state to prolong battery life.</p><p>For those of you who are interested in the technology behind, please read through FAQ #008 &amp; FAQ#009 about Low Current Limit first.</p><p>For the majority of Smart Phones and/or Power Banks, under App Set Up, the Low Current Limit of 0.2A ~ 0.3A and Additional Off Set Time of 20min ~ 30min will be sufficient to take you to 95% ~ 100% charging state.</p><p>And to lower the battery charging % (say, to 85% ~ 95%), you may experiment and change the Low Current Limit to 0.3A ~ 0.4A, and Additional Off Set Time to 0min ~ 10min for your Smart Phone / Power Bank.  With the higher the Current Limit threshold value, this means than when the battery is “nearly” charged, the rate of the current flow will go slower (from higher value than 0.4A to lower value), so that our current detection mechanism will see 0.3A ~ 0.4A quicker than seeing 0.2A ~ 0.3A.  Similarly with lowering the Additional Off Set Time for charging from 20min~30min down to 0min~10min, the charging process will stop quicker.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FAQ #015:  Why do you need Factory Default option on the App?</strong></p><p>When you changed the Setting Value within the App (such as the Count Down Timer, Over Current Limit Value, Low Current Limit setting, etc.), sometimes it may not be appropriate for your next charging device (such as charging a Smart Watch then charging a Smart Phone); and the quickest way is to set to Factory Default to recover with the original out of factory setting.  And after a Factory Default is set within the App, please make sure to press the RESET button on GardCharge device afterward to ensure a fresh new charging cycle with Factory Default setting.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FAQ #016:  Why is the App disconnected after RESET is pressed?</strong></p><p>We designed GardCharge with non-auto reconnect feature after the RESET button is pressed on the GardCharge device; so that Android/iPhone’s App will be disconnected by default.  To re-connect, you may refer to FAQ #013 for wireless connection procedure.</p><p>The reason for implementing non-auto reconnect after RESET is that we don’t know which member in your family will use his/her respective phone to connect to GardCharge for the next charging cycle; so it is not appropriate to auto reconnect to the last smart phone connected, otherwise, the user with next charging cycle cannot connect with the App.</p><p> </p><p><strong>F</strong><strong>AQ #017:  What’s inside of GardCharge Hardware?</strong></p><p>We've chosen Texas Instruments' TI CC2541 Wireless MCU along with TI INA138NA/250 Current Output Current Shunt Monitor, as the key Wireless Microprocessor and current sensing components to build GardCharge.</p><p>While the rest of electronic materials are procured in Taiwan and Japan (such as FRAM, resistors, capacitors, inductors, PCB Board, etc.); and mechanical materials procured in Taiwan and China (such as Housing, USB connectors, etc.)</p></div>","GardCharge takes away our modern day worriesNowadays almost everyone has a smart phone; and that charging smart phone has become our daily ritual, especially at the night time when the majority of people would charge their phones.  And for many us, we do worry about charging the phone overnight with overheating safety concerns for ourselves, our elderly relatives,  and our children.That’s why we at Joybien designed GardCharge to address overnight battery charging concerns by stopping the charging process when the Smart Phone or Power Bank charging process is complete, or by a fixed countdown timer to shut down the power at a given time duration.  And that GardCharge will physically disconnect the power from your USB Cable to your Smart Phone or Power Bank; thus,  GardCharge not only will make you sleep better at night with battery charging safety protection, but also GardCharge will prolong your Smart Phone’s battery life by keeping the battery cool without the excess heating generated by more than required charging process. GardCharge with Simple to Use Power Safety ProtectionGardCharge is very user friendly.  To install, simply connect GardCharge in between the Power Adaptor and the USB Cable that leads to your Smart Phone or Power Bank, and you are ready to go with power safety protection.  And a press on the RESET button immediately after the charging connection will ensure a fresh new cycle of Count Down Time for charging (with default of 6 Hour, and can be changed to 00:01 ~ 23:59 in Hour:Minute format via App).  And GardCharge also has a built-in Over-Current Protection that cuts off the Power automatically to keep away sudden in rush of unnecessary high electric current due to battery charging abnormalities.  Moreover, GardCharge will detect when a charging process is complete (even before the count down timer is due), and cuts off the power afterward. And you may easily customize Count Down Timer, Over-Current Protection, and Charging Completion parameter values via App setting change.With App running on a Android or iPhone, GardCharghe also provides Power Measurement info right on the App for you to monitor the on-going real-time voltage, current, power information in Meter Mode & Graph Mode so that you may  observe and understand better about the overall battery charging system’s health characteristics.And GardCharge can do more!  GardCharge may also be used as a “smart device enabler” for your dumb USB Adaptor or other dumb USB devices (such as an always-on USB LED Light or Fan) to make these dumb devices Smart with Smart Phone Control in no time. Smart Charger

GardCharge provides Power/Current pass-through from Power Adapter to a charging device (such as a smart phone) via connected USB cable, and with Measurement Range of 3.6VDC ~ 21VDC and 0A ~ 3.5A covering the range of QC2.0/3.0 charging. FAQ #007:  What is Over Current Protection?Normally your smart phones or power banks will accept Current value of 0.5A ~ 2.1A, and for some special devices with 3A, when charging.Sometimes due to sudden misbehavior of the physical Power Adapter, USB Cable, or Smart Phone (like Power Surge); there might be an in-rush of higher than normal Current, which we call “Over Current”.  And we have Over Current Protection with the default value set at 4A as the threshold; while, pending your need, adjustable to 0.1A ~ 4A via App; and GardCharge will automatically cut off the Power/Current supplied to the USB Cable (and thus, cut off the Power/Current to the attached smart phone or power bank) to protect your charging device.So, Over Current Protection is like having a FUSE or Circuit Breaker to protect your Charging Device. FAQ #008:  What is Low Current Limit ?With Low Current Limit ENABLEd (as a default for the manufacturer setting), GardCharge will automatically activate intelligent algorithms to auto detect whether you have plugged-in or unplugged a charging device (such as a smart phone), and to start charging (with a fresh new cycle per your last setting) or to stop charging accordingly.In Essense, it is placing GardCharge in automatic charging mode. FAQ #009:  How does Low Current Limit work?* We recommend that you keep the default value for Low Current Limit with 0.3A, and with Additional Time Off Set at 30min for normal daily use (same as the factory default setting). And the way the Low Current Limit work is that when a charging device (like a smart phone) is reaching near fully charged state, the Current going through (and supplied to the charging device) will get slower, and thus, with lower real time current sensing/detection value; and when the current value reached below 0.3A threshold (or any other value between 0.05A ~ 0.5A for the threshold set via App), GardCharge will continue charging for additional 30min for the Time Off Set (or you may set with other Time value between 0min ~ 60min) to ensure that enough additional Power/Current is charged after reaching the Low Current Threshold. FAQ #010:  Can GardCharge work as a Mechanical Timer ?Yes.  By selecting DISABLE for the Low Current Limit within the Set Up configuration in the App, GardCharge will work as a Mechanical Count Down Timer (with Power always ON until count down to 0 min & sec); and will re-initiate the count down time whenever the RESET button is pressed.Note in this Mode, you will not be in automatic charging mode, and will not have the auto sensing/detection of plugging or unplugging the USB Cable when charging mentioned in FAQ #008. FAQ #011:  Can GardCharge be used for Smart Watch charging?Yes.  Please set the GardCharge as a Mechanical Timer per FAQ #010 by DISABLEing the Low Current Limit; and set the Count Down Timer to, say, 30min ~ 1Hour pending your Smart Watch charging time requirement.This is due to Smart Watch uses very little Power/Current when charging, and sometimes lower than the lower bound limit of the Low Current Limit of 0.05A; so that the Low Current Limit may not suitable to use here for the auto Current detection. FAQ #012:  When to use Mechanical Timer mode?Other than charging Smart Watch mentioned within FAQ #011, you may need to run Mechanical Timer mode for devices with very low charging current (for charging current less than, say, 0.3A), or for devices normally running with very low current (say, less than 0.3A; such as USB LED Night-Light) or devices with unstable current (such as USB Fan with current running dynamically between 0A ~ 0.5A).And of course, you may just use Mechanical Timer mode as you feel appropriate.  You will still have the benefit of Over Current Protection, but just keep in mind that Power/Current will be supplied until Count Down Timer reached the end. FAQ #013:  How to wireless connect GardCharge with App?First search and install “GardCharge” App on your iPhone or Android Phone from Apple iOS App Store or Google Play Store respectively.Then enable Bluetooth in your smart phone Set Up (if Bluetooth is not yet enabled); and run the App to proceed for the connection process. And make sure that GardCharge device is connect to your Power Adapter and with green-light ON.For iOS, press the Search-Magnifier icon on the Upper Right corner of the App, and you will see GardCharge device icon with alpha-numeric ID name shown on screen (and if you have more than one GardCharge device, you will see more than one device icon on screen).  Press and select the appropriate GardCharge device icon to connect.For Android, press the Menu Selection on the Upper Left, then select “Scan/Connect”, and you will see GardCharge device’s alpha-numeric ID name shown on screen (and if you have more than one GardCharge devce, you will see more than one device ID on the screen list).  Press and select the appropriate GardCharge device ID to connect.Note, for a small percentage of Android phone, it may take a little longer to Scan (may take 5 sec ~ 30 sec).  And if a GardCharge device is ON and nearby, but you cannot see the device ID on App screen list, please press the “SCAN” on the upper-right corner of the App to re-scan.  And if you still have Scan problem, please remove GardCharge App from your Android Phone’s background task, and you may need to restart your Android Phone, then proceed for the Scan process again. FAQ #014:  Can you charge less than 100% ?Yes.Some Smart Phone users may prefer charging the Phone with less than 100% fully charged state to prolong battery life.For those of you who are interested in the technology behind, please read through FAQ #008 & FAQ#009 about Low Current Limit first.For the majority of Smart Phones and/or Power Banks, under App Set Up, the Low Current Limit of 0.2A ~ 0.3A and Additional Off Set Time of 20min ~ 30min will be sufficient to take you to 95% ~ 100% charging state.And to lower the battery charging % (say, to 85% ~ 95%), you may experiment and change the Low Current Limit to 0.3A ~ 0.4A, and Additional Off Set Time to 0min ~ 10min for your Smart Phone / Power Bank.  With the higher the Current Limit threshold value, this means than when the battery is “nearly” charged, the rate of the current flow will go slower (from higher value than 0.4A to lower value), so that our current detection mechanism will see 0.3A ~ 0.4A quicker than seeing 0.2A ~ 0.3A.  Similarly with lowering the Additional Off Set Time for charging from 20min~30min down to 0min~10min, the charging process will stop quicker. FAQ #015:  Why do you need Factory Default option on the App?When you changed the Setting Value within the App (such as the Count Down Timer, Over Current Limit Value, Low Current Limit setting, etc.), sometimes it may not be appropriate for your next charging device (such as charging a Smart Watch then charging a Smart Phone); and the quickest way is to set to Factory Default to recover with the original out of factory setting.  And after a Factory Default is set within the App, please make sure to press the RESET button on GardCharge device afterward to ensure a fresh new charging cycle with Factory Default setting. FAQ #016:  Why is the App disconnected after RESET is pressed?We designed GardCharge with non-auto reconnect feature after the RESET button is pressed on the GardCharge device; so that Android/iPhone’s App will be disconnected by default.  To re-connect, you may refer to FAQ #013 for wireless connection procedure.The reason for implementing non-auto reconnect after RESET is that we don’t know which member in your family will use his/her respective phone to connect to GardCharge for the next charging cycle; so it is not appropriate to auto reconnect to the last smart phone connected, otherwise, the user with next charging cycle cannot connect with the App. FAQ #017:  What’s inside of GardCharge Hardware?We've chosen Texas Instruments' TI CC2541 Wireless MCU along with TI INA138NA/250 Current Output Current Shunt Monitor, as the key Wireless Microprocessor and current sensing components to build GardCharge.While the rest of electronic materials are procured in Taiwan and Japan (such as FRAM, resistors, capacitors, inductors, PCB Board, etc.); and mechanical materials procured in Taiwan and China (such as Housing, USB connectors, etc.)",18.0,9,"2 Campaigns

<div> </div>
<div><strong>What is WHITE HOT REPORT?</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>White Hot Report is a mobile software app that will tell users what is WHITE HOT, and the very best of anything, in about 10 seconds or less. It has been in development for over 1 year. The BIG IDEA is, to give smartphone users an app that offers ranking information, in ""best-of"" categories, as quickly as possible. Whether it's Make-Up Tips, Best Diapers or Safest Cars, WHITE HOT REPORT will rank it. We plan to make it for Android and iPhone mobile phone users, and hope to expand to other operating platforms as soon as possible. We are starting in the U.S. and hope to expand to Canada, Mexico and Great Britain within 9 months</div>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>What is a Mobile app?</strong></div>
<div>I think our friends at Wikipedia have defined it best: A mobile application (or mobile app) is a software application designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers and other mobile devices. They are usually available through application distribution platforms, which are typically operated by the owner of the mobile operating system, such as the Apple App Store, Google Play, Windows Phone Store and BlackBerry App World. Some apps are free, while others must be bought. Usually, they are downloaded from the platform to a target device, such as an iPhone, BlackBerry, Android phone or Windows Phone, but sometimes they can be downloaded to laptops or desktops. --From Wikipedia</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Making a Great App is Like Making Great Chocolate Cake</strong></div>
<div>Think of our app as a sumptuous Chocolate Cake.</div>
<div> </div>

<div> </div>
<div>Most anybody can bake a chocolate cake, but it takes some serious baking skills to produce a cake that is worthy of being judged in a competition. A  truly great chocolate cake will be judged on...</div>

<div> </div>
<div>The same is true with a mobile app. We are not going to try and ""bake that cake"" ourselves. Our ""bakery chefs"" are extremely talented software developers from Certatim in Miami Beach, who have a lot of experience in developing apps that have launched on Apple's App Store. They know about building great apps, and appealing to the targeted audience by incorporating sleek interface, value and utility, innovation and uniqueness, simplicity, quality of experience, and much more--all in developing an app that really resonates and appeals to users.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Certatim will do the app design work and updating software work, which involves a significant amount of programming and database design. Certatim is responsible for making all of the back-end work and service that helps to make the app a success.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>The mobile app as has been described, is actually a combination of 4 separate apps with one universal theme.</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>They are:.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A free, no-pay mobile app for Apple's app store.</div>
<div>A pay-version app for Apple's app store.</div>
<div>A free, no-pay app for Google's Google Play.</div>
<div>A pay-version app for Google's Google Play.</div>

<div>This process will take approximately 4 months. We hope to launch the WHITE HOT REPORT app towards the end of this summer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We, at PAMA AMERICAN LLC, the company that owns and runs WHITE HOT REPORT, will provide all of the front-end content that users will see. We have been doing that for months now, as of this writing. That means updating information on an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and annual basis depending on the topic of concern. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>For example, WHITE HOT stocks are so volatile, they require hourly updates. WHITE HOT NHL Goalies would change on a weekly basis, where other things like WHITE HOT Fashion and WHITE HOT Celebrities would change less often.</div>

<div><strong>Risk Assessment</strong></div>
<div>PAMA AMERICAN, the parent company of WhiteHotReport, was incorporated in the state of Wisconson in January of 2013. Because our operating company has a limited operating history, you should consider and evaluate our operating prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early-stage companies in rapidly evolving markets.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We operate in the mobile applications sector, through which we will derive substantially all of our revenue. The mobile applications business is a new and rapidly evolving industry. The growth of the mobile app industry and the level of demand and market acceptance of our offering is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Many of the threats and challenges faced by mobile application companies are similar to those faced by other software and entertainment industries. They include competition, changes to consumer tastes, maintaining healthy financial ratios in compliance with banking covenants and loss of key personnel. Our future operating results will depend on numerous factors affecting the mobile app industry including:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>• Changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;</div>
<div>• Difficulties we may encounter managing our growth could adversely affect our</div>
<div>operations.</div>
<div>• The availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment;</div>
<div>• The worldwide growth of personal computer, broadband Internet and mobile</div>
<div>device users, and the rate of any such growth;</div>
<div>• General economic conditions, particularly economic conditions adversely</div>
<div>affecting discretionary consumer spending.</div>
<div>• Because we have a new business model and a short operating history, this makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and our future financial results and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.</div>
<div>• Any failure or significant interruption in our computer network could impact our operations and harm our business. Some elements of this system are operated by third parties that we do not control and which would require significant time to replace.</div>
<div>• Security breaches, computer viruses and computer hacking attacks could harm our business and results of operations.</div>
<div>• Eventually, if we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified employees, we may not be able to grow effectively, successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives.</div>
<div>• Expansion into international markets is important for our growth, and as we expand internationally, we will face additional business, political, regulatory, operational, financial and economic risks, any of which could increase our costs and hinder such growth.</div>
<div>• Competition within the broader entertainment industry is intense and our potential users may be attracted to competing forms of entertainment such as offline and traditional online games, television, movies and sports, as well as other entertainment options on the Internet.</div>
<div>• In the future, we may be subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.</div>
<div>• Evolving regulations concerning data privacy may result in increased regulation and different industry standards, which could prevent us from providing our mobile applications to our users, or require us to modify our mobile applications, thereby harming our business.</div>
<div>• We will process, store and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.</div>
<div>• In the event our app proves successful, and demand exceeds our ability to scale quickly, we may be under capitalized in order to adjust to the internal growth necessary to handle the demand, thereby causing a potential degradation in service. Outside capital may need to be injected and thus causing influence from investors that may not be healthy for the long-term best interest of the offering. Attempts at raising outside capital may fail.</div>

What is WHITE HOT REPORT?
 
White Hot Report is a mobile software app that will tell users what is WHITE HOT, and the very best of anything, in about 10 seconds or less. It has been in development for over 1 year. The BIG IDEA is, to give smartphone users an app that offers ranking information, in ""best-of"" categories, as quickly as possible. Whether it's Make-Up Tips, Best Diapers or Safest Cars, WHITE HOT REPORT will rank it. We plan to make it for Android and iPhone mobile phone users, and hope to expand to other operating platforms as soon as possible. We are starting in the U.S. and hope to expand to Canada, Mexico and Great Britain within 9 months

The beautiful thing about WHITE HOT REPORT, it is intended to be used world-wide. Any country, culture, ethnic group, racial group, age group, gender orientation, or language group will reap the rewards of our mobile app. It is universal in it's appeal, in that anyone on earth could benefit by using it on a regular basis.
 
STRETCH GOAL $80,000
 

 
 
 
STRETCH GOAL $80,000 Achieving total success will allow us to develop the app for use on all major mobile platforms--Facebook, Blackberry, iPad, iPod, Nokia, Windows, etc. It will also afford us the opportunity to enter foreign markets. Plus, it will broaden our paid-version offering by allowing us to develop a database intensive website to support the app.
 
In addition, we can improve existing, and implement new, operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; install enhanced management information systems. Our future success and our ability to expand our operations will also depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain qualified engineers, graphic designers, computer scientists, sales, marketing and senior management personnel. Competition for these types of employees is intense due to the high demand for them.

On a smartphone, users don't have the time or physical screen space to be reading long paragraphs of text. WHITE HOT REPORT is short, bullet point information that you can get in about 10 seconds.
 
How will the money you pledge be used?
 
100% of it will go to build the WHITE HOT REPORT mobile application and design the graphic interface. Any additional money raised above and beyond the goal will be used to introduce the app for new operating platforms. This will require even more extensive programming so that it can be launched onto Facebook, Blackberry, Nokia, Windows and iPad.

<h2><strong><span style=""color: #7d005e;"">Meet GoGekko, the creators of iGab</span></strong></h2>
<p>Kathryn, Claudia and Sabine, two Americans and one German, are the founders of GoGekko GbR.</p>
<p>GoGekko GbR is a woman-owned mobile app development company based in Hamburg, Germany. iGab, GoGekko’s first 3D voice messenger iOS app available on iTunes, was created to provide a fun and personalized way to send mobile messages, without being manually typed. iGab combines the user's voice with a video animated 3D character to create a one-of-a-kind visual message.</p>
<p>iGab brings mobile messages to life. </p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong><span style=""color: #7d005e;"">Why iGab was created</span></strong></h2>
<p>Over a leisurely Sunday brunch, three women began discussing the volume of text messages used in their daily lives, and how tedious it is to manually type out all those texts. Not to mention the lack of emotion in this form of communication. Could there be a way to make sending those reminders to get milk or asking friends out for drinks just a little more <em>fun</em>?</p>
<p>These three women went on to create a 3D voice messenger mobile app providing an animated way of communicating with friends and family, and saving the world from boring messages.</p>

iGab is here to make your mobile texts, and your life, FUN!


 
Meet GoGekko, the creators of iGab
Kathryn, Claudia and Sabine, two Americans and one German, are the founders of GoGekko GbR.
GoGekko GbR is a woman-owned mobile app development company based in Hamburg, Germany. iGab, GoGekko’s first 3D voice messenger iOS app available on iTunes, was created to provide a fun and personalized way to send mobile messages, without being manually typed. iGab combines the user's voice with a video animated 3D character to create a one-of-a-kind visual message.
iGab brings mobile messages to life. 
 
Why iGab was created
Over a leisurely Sunday brunch, three women began discussing the volume of text messages used in their daily lives, and how tedious it is to manually type out all those texts. Not to mention the lack of emotion in this form of communication. Could there be a way to make sending those reminders to get milk or asking friends out for drinks just a little more fun?
These three women went on to create a 3D voice messenger mobile app providing an animated way of communicating with friends and family, and saving the world from boring messages.
 
Send an iGab message in 4 easy steps.

Almost all of the smart phones, digital music players, digital cameras etc, fall in this range of power wattage.<br/><br/>Solacket charges your devices not just when there is light, but when it is dark too. It is equipped with an internal battery that can be used to charge your device when there is no sun or in the night. When you just keep Solacket out in the sun, it charges its internal batter, when any device is connected to it to charge, it<br/><br/>We created this great concept keeping in mind that the new generation have huge concern on our environment, they really want to make use of renewable energy and green energy but they cannot afford the devices because they are freaking costly. Even if they do, they cannot carry them, because they are freaking heavy.<br/><br/>We had lots of designs in our mind, but we chose the one design that is <b>cost effective</b> and<b> portable</b>, we built that on a bread board with separate<b> </b>components. All our test cases proved the functionality, this smaller device can be made and this great concept can be seen in reality soon.<br/><br/>We have come to Indiegogo because we cannot afford to build the tools for manufacturing even after putting all our hard earned money cutting down all our expenses, week end movies, vacation trips, fancy dresses etc.<br/><br/>We believe this idea is unique and worth supporting.

<p><b>You may
ask what difference it makes because my phone just uses 6 watts of power.</b></p>
<p>Well, according to the data evaluated in 2013, 97% of the people use mobile phones in the world. One phone uses 4 to 8 watts of power but
there are 11 billion devices such as phones, music players and digital cameras which use the same 4 to 8 watts of power. The
average power consumed by all of them put together is approximately 66 billion watts.
It’s freaking 66 billon watts folks. <br/></p><p>That’s like one month of power used by any
large city in the world. Almost all of it is from Coal, Oil, Natural Gas,
Nuclear etc that are hazardous to the environment. Imagine if all of it was green
energy - we could have saved the earth from getting even dirtier!

Solacket is the world's first Pocket Sized Solar Charger that can be used to charge any electronic gadget that falls in the power wattage range of 4 watts to 12 watts. Almost all of the smart phones, digital music players, digital cameras etc, fall in this range of power wattage.Solacket charges your devices not just when there is light, but when it is dark too. It is equipped with an internal battery that can be used to charge your device when there is no sun or in the night. When you just keep Solacket out in the sun, it charges its internal batter, when any device is connected to it to charge, itWe created this great concept keeping in mind that the new generation have huge concern on our environment, they really want to make use of renewable energy and green energy but they cannot afford the devices because they are freaking costly. Even if they do, they cannot carry them, because they are freaking heavy.We had lots of designs in our mind, but we chose the one design that is cost effective and portable, we built that on a bread board with separate components. All our test cases proved the functionality, this smaller device can be made and this great concept can be seen in reality soon.We have come to Indiegogo because we cannot afford to build the tools for manufacturing even after putting all our hard earned money cutting down all our expenses, week end movies, vacation trips, fancy dresses etc.We believe this idea is unique and worth supporting. Please do support us and help us contribute to the green energy innovation.
How different is our design?
Fold-able!
Internal Battery!
USB Supported!
Light Weight!
Stylish and Compact!
Portable and Handy!
Energy Efficient! & Eco Friendly!
Available with all universal pins + Adapters too!
Can be used anywhere in the world!
Can be used for wide range of electronic gadgets!
USB Supported!Intelligent and Smart - Charges Phone First and then Itself! Solacket
first charges the devices that are connected and
then charges its internal battery. Internal battery can be used to charge your
phone/camera/tablets anytime and anywhere later!Simply unfold and keep it anywhere there is some light. _________________________________________________________________________
You may
ask what difference it makes because my phone just uses 6 watts of power.
Well, according to the data evaluated in 2013, 97% of the people use mobile phones in the world. One phone uses 4 to 8 watts of power but
there are 11 billion devices such as phones, music players and digital cameras which use the same 4 to 8 watts of power. The
average power consumed by all of them put together is approximately 66 billion watts.
It’s freaking 66 billon watts folks. That’s like one month of power used by any
large city in the world. Almost all of it is from Coal, Oil, Natural Gas,
Nuclear etc that are hazardous to the environment. Imagine if all of it was green
energy - we could have saved the earth from getting even dirtier!

Better late than never, let’s contribute to this
green energy innovation; let’s make the Mother Nature fresher, and cleaner!
It's possible when you support us to bring this concept into reality!_________________________________________________________________________What you charge and where you charge is your choice!

We have been working on Solar Chargers for the past one year using our personal funds to get to this point. We have come up with a unique design that suites everyone and every smart phone / digital camera. Currently we have individual components solar cells, Li-ion batteries, Bread-boards, cables that prove our design. We have done lots of iterative testing and refining for over a year. We are now working hard on building our first fully complete pre-production unit. Your support will make us bring this concept into reality. You are no just contributing for this project, you are contributing for making use of renewable energy that largely helps in reducing pollution and saving the environment.Please check our survey to know how much positive impact this project makes on environment.Manufacturing Process TimelinesOther Ways You Can Help!If it's difficult for you to contribute money, we truly understand.

<h2><b><br/></b></h2>
<h2><b>QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK</b></h2>
<p><b>How old must I be to purchase a spirits?</b></p>
<p>You must of legal drinking age in your country on the day of contributing in this campaign. Do not be creative</p>
<p><b>Can I buy spirits now if I’m not at legel age now but will be by 2015?</b></p>
<p>Again, you must be of legal drinking age AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE.</p>
<p><b>Can I buy spirits now if I’m not at legal age but am giving it as a gift to someone who is?</b></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><b>When will the spirits be made?</b></p>
<p>Most of it is already prepared and is waiting for you in the barrels. Since barrel aging takes some time, we thought about this three years ago and now want to share this with you. We are promising a set of unique drinks. </p>
<p><b>Just how rare are these products?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Pretty damn rare! The
apple whisky does not exists anywhere, the apple brandy aged in sherry cask
likewise - completely unique. The pommeau made from Swedish apples, nowhere. So
take this opportunity and be the first!</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Are you shipping your products direct in Europe?</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s pretty much legal
to ship alcohol direct to consumers in Europe, so yes. When the spirit is
ready, you’ll be notified and asked where you want us to ship this to. There
will be a charge to cover shipping and handling. If you live in the certain
states in the US or another country where liquor laws are.. hmm restricted. You
need to allow us some time to find a good partner where you can collect your
products. </p>
<p><b>What if I want to switch the product I purchased to another product in the series?</b></p>
<p>We understand being selective. We were VERY specific in our choices, too. We don’t well up with glee in making this decree, but NO CHANGES will be allowed. Once a decision is made, the die is cast.</p>
<p><b>What if I have a change of heart and no longer want the products I purchased?</b></p>
<p>Sorry, but all sales are final. Choose wisely and be at peace with your decision before clicking CONTRIBUTE.</p>
<p><b>Will any of these products be available for retail purchase later on?</b></p>
<p>Anyone, including distributing companies and retail operations, can purchase the products during the campaign at the same price as the general public. There is no way for us to police who purchases the products via this platform. However, if it should end up being resold at a retail establishment, it will have traveled from Distributor to Retailer and gotten marked up along the way, thus the Retailer will be selling it at a substantially higher price (that’s how the spirts biz generally works). </p>
<p>Remember, noone have the very same label as you do!</p>
<p><b>How much may I purchase?</b></p>
<p>First off, we LOVE your attitude and are glad to say you can purchase as many as you like. The Apple Whisky and Apple Brandy is unfortunately limited. First come, first served. But because you’re buying “spirits-futures”, we will do our best to accommodate all of you.</p>
<p>Let's innovate the spirits market together!</p>

</div></div>","Be a part of the creation of the first apple whisky –
And let’s take Pommeau outside of france!

All natural ingredients.
Nothing else!






Our award winning Pommeau is comprised of a blend of our apple brandy (calvados) and
fresh apple juice, then aged in oak barrels for at least one year. 


The award winning Apple Brandy is made the traditional way Calvados is made, but only with Swedish apples, which brings out more apple flavor to the drink. To top this off, we have used doublewood to age the apple brandy. 


Then we have a completely unique Apple whisky. You know what Whisky tastes like;
imagine that we distilled it in our pot still right after the apple brandy and then put the whisky to age in a used apple brandy cask.  It is smooth and soft and full of flavor from the raw material, just like all our products. 



In Sweden, apples matures slowly, becomes firmer
and get a richer flavor. XO Spirits makes Pommeau and Apple Brandy
​​solely from apples from southern Sweden (Österlen), and a Whisky which is made
of Swedish malt, nothing else. 








Without
any artificial, unnatural ingredients, this is made with a straightforward
production process that emphasizes the raw materials own taste - without
superfluous efforts, complications or manipulations.  It is handcrafted!    
We distill everything in our Pot Still which captures the flavor from the raw material in a quite unique way.The apple whisky undergoes the same unique process as the apple brandy and that is why its natural flavors are smooth, soft and upfront. The apple whisky is one of a kind and is not released yet, so this is world premiere!!!                                                                                    


Why are we doing this?
We learned the trade of making wine and spirits from Moët Hennessy a few years back and discovered when we came back to Sweden that we probably have the best apples in the world to make good beverages from. 




What We Need & What You Get 

We need funds to
expand outside Sweden and grow our production capacity.  You will decide
which countries we will expand to by contributing. Each perk gives you a number of votes to a country. This will be tracked on our

For each market we estimate we need $50 000. This will allow us to participate in the most important spirits exhibition in that market; plus fund the necessary compliance adjustments to get started.
We are moving to a new production facility this fall which allows us
to ramp up production capacity to about 50 000 bottles per year.  It is 1200sq meters and located in Österlen, Southern Sweden. Österlen is like the
Swedish version of Napa Valley, Bordeaux, Tuscany, Yarra Valley, etc (I

     costs $133 000.We offer perks from
     owning your own barrel to joining us at the distillery to distill your own
     favorite booze.

brands products with ours one after the other. We will expand into other markets and we also ask for you direction here. Check out the perk ""Expansion""!



We believe it is important to be
transparent to our customer, consumers and you who supports us. When we sell
our products we explain the procedures how we make the products. We communicate
the ingredients on the label together with the person who has made it. This means that you can directly contact the person who made your bottle for
questions or comments.  No fuzz!!


 When shall I drink it?
Our products are especially good when you just want to enjoy a moment because it is smooth and soft with flavors of the natural raw materials and authenticity. Pommeau is an Aperitif with 18% alcohol but also perfect after dinner with a dessert or by itself with ice on the veranda with a good friend. The Apple Brandy and Whisky hold about 40% alcohol and is perfect to enjoy with a good friend or a cigarr. 
Risk & Challenges
We have signed a rental agreement with the seller of the property until we have received the funding to purchase it. This reduces the risk of losing the property to another party in the meantime.  



Will put
your name on the label, great isn't it?

What happens now?
You order and pay now, and then we work together until your spirit is ready. All products will be stored in new french oak barrels and then in a used barrels for doublewood effect. The delivery of the finished product will be in about 1-3 years depending on your choice of product. If you do not want to wait that long, we can customize any of our standard range of products already on the barrel, and therefore can be bottled earlier. Let us know. 




You pay a fee for your reservation and storage of spirits
here on the indiegogo website.


When You paid the money we will register you reservation.
Congratulations! We will send proof of ownership for your reservation.


We start preparing your particular spirit in the distillery
and fill up the barrel. We will keep you posted on the activity.  


All barrels are stored in our warehouse. You may sample each
year and follow the development and maturation.


We consult with you about when it is time to bottle the
spirits. Tell us what you want to have on the label. Up
to 30 characters.


When we have bottled Your spirit. We will send it to an approved
outlet for you to pick up and pay the remains of the bottles.


At the outlet, they will charge current alcohol tax, VAT and
outlet's margin will be added when you pick up the bottled spirits.


Time to enjoy your own unique spirit.




QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK
How old must I be to purchase a spirits?
You must of legal drinking age in your country on the day of contributing in this campaign. Do not be creative
Can I buy spirits now if I’m not at legel age now but will be by 2015?
Again, you must be of legal drinking age AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE.
Can I buy spirits now if I’m not at legal age but am giving it as a gift to someone who is?
No.
When will the spirits be made?
Most of it is already prepared and is waiting for you in the barrels. Since barrel aging takes some time, we thought about this three years ago and now want to share this with you. We are promising a set of unique drinks. 
Just how rare are these products?

Pretty damn rare! The
apple whisky does not exists anywhere, the apple brandy aged in sherry cask
likewise - completely unique. The pommeau made from Swedish apples, nowhere. So
take this opportunity and be the first!
Are you shipping your products direct in Europe?

It’s pretty much legal
to ship alcohol direct to consumers in Europe, so yes. When the spirit is
ready, you’ll be notified and asked where you want us to ship this to. There
will be a charge to cover shipping and handling. If you live in the certain
states in the US or another country where liquor laws are.. hmm restricted. You
need to allow us some time to find a good partner where you can collect your
products. 
What if I want to switch the product I purchased to another product in the series?
We understand being selective. We were VERY specific in our choices, too. We don’t well up with glee in making this decree, but NO CHANGES will be allowed. Once a decision is made, the die is cast.
What if I have a change of heart and no longer want the products I purchased?
Sorry, but all sales are final. Choose wisely and be at peace with your decision before clicking CONTRIBUTE.
Will any of these products be available for retail purchase later on?
Anyone, including distributing companies and retail operations, can purchase the products during the campaign at the same price as the general public. There is no way for us to police who purchases the products via this platform. However, if it should end up being resold at a retail establishment, it will have traveled from Distributor to Retailer and gotten marked up along the way, thus the Retailer will be selling it at a substantially higher price (that’s how the spirts biz generally works). 
Remember, noone have the very same label as you do!
How much may I purchase?
First off, we LOVE your attitude and are glad to say you can purchase as many as you like. The Apple Whisky and Apple Brandy is unfortunately limited. First come, first served. But because you’re buying “spirits-futures”, we will do our best to accommodate all of you.

<p><b>Introduction:</b></p>
<p>My name is Lyman Connor. In October 2013 I was involved in a near fatal bicycle accident. The days that I spent in the Neuro ICU left me with plenty to think about. Would I be able to go forth with my career? How would I handle the stigma of not being considered ""normal"" as I had scars across my face and had lost the use of an eye? I knew that It would take a long time to recover from the physical and psychological injuries but I was determined. All of my strife and self pity were put into perspective and blown away the day that I was discharged. I had occasion to share an elevator ride to the lobby with a young family whose son was missing his right hand and that chance encounter led to the creation of the ""Mano-Matic"".

<p>I am going to design and make a  suite of low cost, high tech enabling devices that can be purchased for pennies on the dollar. The Mano-Matic is the first product in this suite.

<p> I have been 100% self financed to date and have absolutely run out of funds.

<p align=""left"">We are 25 years old entrepreneurs, we know each other since high<br/>school. In these days we are both working in high tech companies.<br/>We love to think about new ideas that could help other people.<br/>Our dream is to quit our jobs and start a business of our own.</p>
<p align=""left""><br/><strong><font color=""#ff6820"" size=""5"">                                                                                       <br/>Risks and Challenges: </font></strong><br/>Like every project, we had challenges during the design process,<br/>first we printed it using a 3D printer, just to see if it will<br/>fit to the earphones cables, we repeated this process several<br/>times until we got a good prototype. Then we moved to a rubber prototype,<br/>at first we got a model that was too elastic so the earphones cables just<br/>slipped from it, after several tests we increased the rubber strength<br/>and got a model that can keep the cables in the right position.</p>

Tired of having tangles every time you leave your earphones for one second?We present to you, the Closure.The perfect solution for tangle earphones.The main advantage of this product is that it can stay onyour earphones in any time





                                                                                          What is it made of? Closure is made of rubber, and weights less than 3g,it is elastic and can be suitable for various kinds of earphonesthere are two slots in each side, which through them Closure can connect easily to your earphone.We added a plastic white cover to each Closure - so you canstick your own special sticker (see more information about this below)
 


 


Design Process
When we first thought about the idea, we tested it using a rubber band,just to make sure the cables will not tangle when connecting all the ends together.
Then we drew some sketches to see how it will look like.


Then we move to Illustrations - to see how the product will look like.

                       

For our prototype, we printed our model using a 3D printer,and after a few weeks  (maybe more than few...) we got the perfect model.
Before mass production we verified that the sizes are right.

About us: 
We are 25 years old entrepreneurs, we know each other since highschool. In these days we are both working in high tech companies.We love to think about new ideas that could help other people.Our dream is to quit our jobs and start a business of our own.
                                                                                       Risks and Challenges: Like every project, we had challenges during the design process,first we printed it using a 3D printer, just to see if it willfit to the earphones cables, we repeated this process severaltimes until we got a good prototype. Then we moved to a rubber prototype,at first we got a model that was too elastic so the earphones cables justslipped from it, after several tests we increased the rubber strengthand got a model that can keep the cables in the right position.
Warning: Not for children under 3 yrs - small partsThank you so much for checking out our project!!! 
And Remember, Closure is for everyone ! :)",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

Users receive coupons & promotional offers. A new targeted platform for advertisers!The App Color & Logo""Bajar"" means marketplace in Bangladesh. Therefore eBajar means electronic marketplace. Bangladesh is home to 170 million people. It is the world's most densely populated country. Traffic congestion is an everyday problem in major cities. People do not have the time to visit different marketplaces and find the best price, best promotion, best deals. And that is where ""eBajar"" comes into play.There will be both website (static & dynamic) as well as mobile application for eBajar. There are 3 (three) benefits to the user of this app:(i) The user gets the latest price of (a) groceries (b) electronics (c) automobiles (d) real-estate (e) events: concert, art exhibition, sports, etc. (f) services: hotels, air, bus, train, etc.The InterfaceBy saying the latest price, our team updates the current market price of literally everything you find at a grocery stores, electronics store, automobiles as well as events that are taking place in the city.(ii) Benefit#2: The user not only gets the current market price BUT also gets a virtual cart (wish list) where he/she can add the products and services they need. In other words the user benefits from NOT having to write down the grocery list or type it down in their notes anymore. They can add the products in their wish list and get to see the total budget. The users get an idea how much money to take out (from home or ATM) before they go out for shopping. Users can even forward the cart(wish list) to another person to carry out the shopping.The Virtual Cart (Wish-List)(iii) And the best part: Benefit#3: The user gets coupons, promotional offers, discounts and many exciting offers based on what they have in their cart. The users get to see the nearest seller from the maps. The user gets all the information of sellers including current promotions. The user gets notification if prices of a product/service changes that is already in their cart. Users also get notified if the date/time/venue of an event changes that is already in their cart.Exciting Coupons!Its not the end of benefits, the user can follow their favorite stores and get updates of their current offers, coupons, promotions.

<h3>What are Nano Crystals?</h3>
<div>A nano crystal is made of materials that are small enough to exhibit quantum mechanical properties. The first commercial release was the Sony flat panel television in 2013. Self-assembled nano crystals are typically between 5 and 50 nm in size, and small enough to exhibit quantum confinement effects. There are different chemical and physical solutions for the nano crystal growth. The idea, to use nano crystals in batteries is not new. The challenge is to manipulate the chemistry of this nano crystals and to fine-tune the self-assambly.</div>

<h3>Risks and Challenge </h3>
<div>We are an amazing team, but there is always the potential  of problems that may alter our plans. Changes in the design maybe have to been  made, suppliers have to be in time, and quality have to be checked. We have seen many stones on our way till now, and we know, we will see more, but till now none have stopped us. And with your support everything will be possible. The highest hurdle, making the prototype work, is already behind us.</div>

What are Nano Crystals?
A nano crystal is made of materials that are small enough to exhibit quantum mechanical properties. The first commercial release was the Sony flat panel television in 2013. Self-assembled nano crystals are typically between 5 and 50 nm in size, and small enough to exhibit quantum confinement effects. There are different chemical and physical solutions for the nano crystal growth. The idea, to use nano crystals in batteries is not new. The challenge is to manipulate the chemistry of this nano crystals and to fine-tune the self-assambly.

Risks and Challenge 
We are an amazing team, but there is always the potential  of problems that may alter our plans. Changes in the design maybe have to been  made, suppliers have to be in time, and quality have to be checked. We have seen many stones on our way till now, and we know, we will see more, but till now none have stopped us. And with your support everything will be possible. The highest hurdle, making the prototype work, is already behind us.

When I realized there was nothing on the market to address the issue - I went to work. $100,000, and 2 years later, the Lifesaver Case is ready to do just that.""These are just a few of the sobering statistics uncovered:FBI, National Crime Information Center & US Justice Department Now for the fun part!The Lifesaver Case was designed to save lives but we truly hope you never have the need for this feature. That's why we made the case stylish and functional for everyday use. The Lifesaver Case is proudly endorsed by the following organizations:N.C.A.D.V. (National Coalition Against Domestic Violence)“Having immediate access to discreetly contacting emergency services can potentially mean the difference between life and death for a victim of domestic violence or other crimes. The Lifesaver Case is a fantastic new tool that will help enable victims of violence to access safety quickly and effectively in a way that may prevent them from experiencing further harm.” 
The National Network to End Domestic Violence

""The National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV) appreciates innovations that are meant to empower survivors of abuse and provide them with tools to help maintain their safety. The Lifesaver Case is a unique product that may offer that. We are pleased to be working with this company to incorporate our safety & technology expertise. Their focus on safety and privacy for survivors is a critical factor that will make this product helpful.""Veteran's for Missing and Exploited Children""We here at Veterans For Missing And Exploited Children believe the Lifesaver Case will indeed do just that.  As the abduction rate is  climbing, so are the number of children with cell phones.  It only makes sense to arm these children with the Lifesaver Case.""...We are proudly supported by:

<p>Hello,
I’m Branden Parker and I've been in the IT industry for over 12 years. I
started with building systems in the late 90’s for a small custom computer shop
and worked my way through a help-desk all the way to network administrator. I've
been with both small companies as well as multi-million dollar companies. I truly
believe that access to information is the key to the future. But many areas of
the world are still without decent access or have no access to the world via
the internet. This is simply due to the very high cost of having internet in
their home. </p>
<p>Our
idea is simple, if they can’t have it in their home; bring it to them in mass.
In many areas there are already places where the people can use a computer and
access the internet. But most of them are very small, only 3-5 computers with
very slow internet access. These places are often times very run down,
unsanitary buildings yet have customers 24 hours of the day and all the systems
are in use at virtually all times. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/31344/files/20130824091730-Internet_Open.jpg?1377361050"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition they cannot be upgraded to
handle to requirements of a full scale internet café operation. Their rates are
high and they offer nothing but an old computer. We intend to change all that
by either utilizing an existing structure than can handle the power load, or
build one of our own, we also intend on offering a full service location. By
offering not just access to a better internet experience but also food, drink
and games consoles.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>The plan itself is also pretty simple. Before I leave, I’ll
have all of the computers, networking equipment and other hardware shipped to a
local warehouse at the nearest port. I will then fly to the destination that
has yet to be finalized as we are still working with a number of local
governments about the requirements needed in the more rural areas. Once there,
a location will be found and remodeled to handle the power consumption needed
for the project. </i></p>
<p><i>During this time, all employees will be found and hired to
help complete the renovations and begin training for the food service portion
of the project. Once complete I will then go and pick up all the equipment
previously shipped and set up the systems. Training the employees will then continue
as they will need to know how to operate the systems. This will provide much
needed jobs in the area as well as the location will then sustain itself with
low cost fees for internet use and food service items. Once the location is
open, I will then head back to the US to begin setting up the next location.</i></p>
<p><i> As stated previously,
this is a not-for-profit entity and will be applying for non-profit status as
well. With this, the prices will remain low enough to make the entire system
affordable to all residents.  Each
location will be open 24 hours and will employ on average 20 people. For these
rural areas that is a lot of jobs that are not available at this time. Thus
improving the local economy in the area as well as providing much needed
internet access.</i></p>
<p><i>Because of the software that will operate the entire
location, it can be operated remotely from the program’s main office in the US.
 This software will be provided by Antamedia.
The computers will be used systems acquired via government entities at ultra
low costs. They will then be refurbished as needed and prepared for shipping.</i></p>
<p>We
here in the US enjoy many amenities and one of which is access to high speed
internet. It has become part of our daily lives just as it can and will be for
those in areas that currently don’t. If we can easily access this luxury,
shouldn't everyone! </p>
<p><b>Our
goals are very modest, a little goes a long way!</b></p>
<p>We
are currently looking to open 2-3 locations across southern and central Mexico.
Each location will cost between $3,000 and $5,000 to open. The American dollar goes
a long way in this region of the world. Initially we are looking for this
funding but any additional funding will be used to open more locations
throughout the area. The funds obtained by the cafe's operations will be used
to open more cafe's across the rural areas of Mexico and then progress to other
Latin American countries as well. </p>
<p><i>The
Perks we are offering at this time, albeit modest, will assist us in
showing the world how generous and caring the American people really are. With
your support we will be able to obtain the computers, servers, and networking equipment needed from various government entities at very low costs. We will then configure all of the systems and servers that will go into each location and ship them with a small envoy of our team to finalize the location and setup. They will then hire and train from within the local community to operate the systems. We already have the software used for controlling all of the systems internet access.</i></p>
<p>If
the full initial funding is not obtained then it will be used in a way to
attempt other types of funding opportunities. These will include obtaining 501(c)3 status and become a fully non-profit organization and professional
production of a video to aid us in showing the current facilities available in
these areas. Once completed we will again work with crowd funding programs to reach our
goal. </p>
<p><b>This
is a real opportunity to show the world who we really are!</b></p>
<p>Providing
this type of service to those who need it the most can make a major impact on
their lives. For instance, with proper access to the internet many of these
people, especially children, will have access to online education. We will be working with other organizations to help us achieve the goal of better and higher education as well. This education can assist them in
obtaining a brighter future through this education and provide a greater
opportunity to enhance their live by obtaining better employment. That is just
one simple example. As we all know here, having access to the world greatly
enhances our lives and ability to not only keep informed but enriches our understanding
of the world. </p>
<p>During
my time in the IT industry I've helped many people take advantage of opportunities
they would not have otherwise had without the power of the computer as well as
the internet. It’s time we bring these same opportunities to others.</p>

the united states and obtain and education she would not otherwise have had
available to her. She furthered that education by going to college and earning
a degree in Business Administration.  After
hearing many of her experiences I believe it is not only necessary for those
without these opportunities to receive them, it should be supported by all
people to enhance the lives of others. Even if it is just a small contribution,
when enough of them are combined, they can have an enormous impact on the lives
of others.</p>

us in this endeavor.</p>

</div></div>","Inskrīb is the easiest LED sign to use in the world
Just turn it on, start up the Inskrīb App, and you're ready to start sending messages from up to 30 feet away!   You already have your bluetooth speakers and bluetooth headphones.  Now you can show off visually with a bluetooth LED sign at your business, your man cave, your dorm room, car or anywhere since it is so portable.  LED signs have gotten ubiquitous but are still expensive and hard to change. We have taken a huge step forward in simplicity and price with our App and sign.  There is nothing like this in the market. However, we are just beginning the journey.  We know when you mix hardware with software you can really elevate a product.  We want to continue to enhance the App, we have a number of ideas already but we need your input, thoughts and suggestions.  
  Let's take a look at the free App that simplifies the work of changing the sign


These 3 screens are your primary access.  The screen on the left comes up after registration and is the main message screen used to send whatever message or messages you want to the sign.  The menu screen in the middle gives you options to add a new message, add a clock or add a count-up or count-down timer to your list of messages, change the sign brightness or turn it off remotely.  The screen on the right is where you enter your new message or change an existing message then set the time, speed, effect and frame (more about these later).
When the App connects to the sign for the first time you will be asked to register using an email address.  At that point we capture the date, time, email and unique ID of your sign for warranty purposes only.  The one year warranty starts when you first connect to the sign.  We do not use your email for any marketing purpose and we protect it from unauthorized use.  Each sign you buy will require registration only once when you initially connect.  After that you should be able to use all the signs you buy with just one App.
The Emoji message is included to show you which Emoji's the sign currently displays, here are examples: There are others, mostly numbers and arrows.  You can copy one or more and paste them into a new message or add them to an existing message to give it extra interest.

Currently you can add up to 99 messages.   You can easily re-order the messages by tapping the message number.
There are 3 Styles: normal, bold and small.  These give you some flexibility when styling your message.
Time is used when you don't want a continuous scrolling message.  Time can be adjusted to provide a delay between rotation of the message or messages.
Speed can be adjusted to display the effect from very slow to very fast.
There are 20 different Effects that you can choose to customize and draw attention to your message.  The ""Blink"" and the ""Snow"" are especially effective.  Select ""Random"" and you get a new effect each time the message is displayed.  Remember, Effects are per message.  If you display more than one message each can have their own effect in the rotation.

Frame is exactly like it sounds, it outlines the entire message to really make it stand out.  Several different frame options are available.
Other features included now


On the left you can add current Time in two different formats.In the middle you can create a Count-Down or Count-Up Timer up to 24 hours.You can send multiple messages in sequence.  From the main message screen, upper right corner tap Sync.  As shown on the screen to the right, highlight the dot with the messages you want to include in the sequence.  Tapping the Send key will send all the selected messages to the sign and each message selected will be displayed in numerical sequence.
For example, imagine the following messages:
Test in progress    Do not enterRemaining time:     00:48:54
You then use Sync and Send to select all 4 messages then mount the sign on the glass door entry.  A big improvement over the do not disturb sign.  As the messages rotate the count-down will continue to decrease.

No project is without their risk and challenges but 
we try to do our absolute best to minimize them. We felt that we have 
done all the necessary preliminary work prior to coming to Indiegogo. We
 are no strangers to battery packs or mobile accessories. That said, we identify the following as our risks, challenges:<br/><br/><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><b>MANUFACTURING</b>: The product shown above is a fully functional final product. We are currently making the final production model which 
will be ready around Dez 01.  We might  be able to meet the early bird Christmas 
shipping deadline. However we never had a battery pack product fail at 
this stage before and initial reports looks very promising. In any case,
 we will inform funders of any manufacturing or shipping delays before 
the project funding ends so funders can decide. If they want to wait or 
not.</p>

<br/>
</figure><ul>
<li><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><b>Shipment</b>: We try to ship out the product in December, 
delivering the early bird products in the US before Christmas is a small
 challenge which requires careful coordination, planning and execution. 
The goods will be delivered via US Postal Service and the deadline for 
Christmas mailing is December 20. </p>
<p>SHIPPING TO INTERNATIONAL FUNDERS: We have been shipping batteries 
internationally, as well as domestically, for several years. There have 
been recent changes in shipping regulations surrounding lithium cell 
batteries. We will work closely with our 
shipping provider to ensure that all our funders receive their beer bank in a
 safe and timely manner.</p>
<p>In order to live up to the expectations that we have set for the beer powerbank, 
we have implemented a strict timeline with our manufacturer. We 
understand that Indiegogo funders want their beer power bank as soon as possible, 
but we also want the beer bank to be of highest quality and up to our 
desired specifications.  </p>
<p>We are dedicated to our project timeline and will keep you informed 
on the status of our progress on a regular basis via updates</p></figure></li>

Christmas mailing is December 20. 
SHIPPING TO INTERNATIONAL FUNDERS: We have been shipping batteries 
internationally, as well as domestically, for several years. There have 
been recent changes in shipping regulations surrounding lithium cell 
batteries. We will work closely with our 
shipping provider to ensure that all our funders receive their beer bank in a
 safe and timely manner.
In order to live up to the expectations that we have set for the beer powerbank, 
we have implemented a strict timeline with our manufacturer. We 
understand that Indiegogo funders want their beer power bank as soon as possible, 
but we also want the beer bank to be of highest quality and up to our 
desired specifications.  
We are dedicated to our project timeline and will keep you informed 
on the status of our progress on a regular basis via updates

Smart
 phones are common on the average citizen's desk in their cubicle,

<h2><strong>Redefining Fitness Tracking:</strong></h2>
<p>At Amiigo we wanted to create something that would allow people to track the details of an exercise routine &amp; how it affects the body.

Amiigo also tracks heart rate, blood oxygen levels, skin temperature, overall activity level, and calories burned. </p>

<h2>The Wrist Bracelet &amp; The Shoe Clip</h2>
<p><strong>Two devices, one purpose = unlimited tracking potential.</strong> The bracelet captures the movement of your upper body, and the shoe clip captures the movement of your lower body. The shoe clip enables detailed tracking for cycling, certain leg exercises, and other activities where arm movement is not present. For the most ideal tracking experience use both devices. But, they can function independently, for times when you're not wearing shoes or can't have anything on your wrist.</p>
<p>The bracelet is <strong>micro-adjustable</strong> allowing for a perfect fit on even the most unique wrist sizes. The shoe clip slides onto any shoe lace and even some shoe straps. Working alone, both devices can track overall activity level and calories burned. For storage and simple portability, attach the shoe clip directly to the bracelet. Both the bracelet and shoe clip are <strong>completely waterproof</strong>.</p>

<p class=""p5""> </p></div>","Redefining Fitness Tracking:
At Amiigo we wanted to create something that would allow people to track the details of an exercise routine & how it affects the body. We wanted to allow users to track specific things like; exercise type, reps, sets, duration, speed, and intensity. Amiigo also tracks heart rate, blood oxygen levels, skin temperature, overall activity level, and calories burned. 


 


How is Amiigo different?
Activity Recognition & Physiological Data. Amiigo provides a more personalized fitness tracking experience because we can detect exactly what you are doing and how your body is responding. For example, Amiigo can determine whether you're using the elliptical, running, swimming, doing bicep curls, squats, etc. Amiigo can track & identify different activities and then correlate these activities with physiological information such as heart rate and blood oxygen saturation.
Create and Record. Users can create and record new exericises that might be unique, abstract or specific to them. After a user records an exercise, it will be recognized in future workouts!

The Wrist Bracelet & The Shoe Clip
Two devices, one purpose = unlimited tracking potential. The bracelet captures the movement of your upper body, and the shoe clip captures the movement of your lower body. The shoe clip enables detailed tracking for cycling, certain leg exercises, and other activities where arm movement is not present. For the most ideal tracking experience use both devices. But, they can function independently, for times when you're not wearing shoes or can't have anything on your wrist.
The bracelet is micro-adjustable allowing for a perfect fit on even the most unique wrist sizes. The shoe clip slides onto any shoe lace and even some shoe straps. Working alone, both devices can track overall activity level and calories burned. For storage and simple portability, attach the shoe clip directly to the bracelet. Both the bracelet and shoe clip are completely waterproof.



Wireless Connectivity 
Using Bluetooth 4.0, the bracelet and shoe clip connect to iOS and Android phones. Amiigo has memory and can store data for hours. A constant Bluetooth connection is not required.
Amiigo allows you to compete with friends, share on social networks, achieve your goals and earn points. So whether you’re a runner, swimmer, cyclist, weight lifter, crossfitter, golfer, out-door enthusiast or just an active person... Amiigo has something for you. Our goal is to make fitness more fun, simple and social.

<p>Many hand held products beside cell phones run on batteries, but replacing batteries in these products can be expensive, not to mention the waste of recycling them. Re-chargeable batteries are available, but they require a separate charger. How many different Docking Stations do you currently have? Or are you just looking for a way to reduce USB connectors in your life. </p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong></p>
<p>Products with Nantronics's built-in “FlexGrid-Charger” would give the user the option of re-charging their devices batteries using an induction plate from many brand-names, such as PowerMat, Energizer, or LG. The charger would provide the same wireless hook-up when recharging batteries only available for a limited number of cell phones. Therefore reducing the number of Docking Stations you currently own or will own. Your life with less USB connectors!</p>
<p><strong><em>Where we're at </em></strong></p>

From the video you can see we have several working prototype of all products list on this campaign. The campaign drive is to raise money in order to bring to market Nantronics’s first products with built-in induction charging.</p>
<p>From the Industrial Designer, ""To give you a brief explanation, the design direction took inspiration from TRON and the ""GRID"". Since Nantronics is a flex grid induction charging technology line, the design evokes a sense of sleek modern technology, while implying the cool feature: induction charging. Thus, all the designs include some form of lighting that when placed on the charging mat, will glow and indicate charge power. I thought this would be a great subtle feature to set your brand apart from a lot of the other electronic brands out there.The designs are unique, without being foreign.""</p>

<p><b>Birth of Z-nergy</b></p>
<p>Z-nergy was
born out of the need to address the plight of every phone users. We (Hameed and
Olalekan) are two childhood friends that are very passionate about technology.
Often times, we meet family, friends and colleagues who always complain about
their phones’ batteries. Everyone wishes to have a phone whose battery power is
not depletable. But that is not the reality today. So, we decided to create a
mobile charger that’s so powerful that it can sustain your phone efficiency for
days. To many of us, it is like our phones constantly drain the battery when we
need them most. Hence, Z-nergy was created to allay your fears of your dying
phone. We are so passionate about this device that we believe everybody should
own one.</p>

<br/><h2><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Before EZtalk, it comes Snailink</span></h2> <p></p>
<p><b>Snailink</b> is a high-quality mobile accessory brand created for iPhone.  At Snailnk we <b>LOVE</b> creating cool innovational products for people who
live and breathe technology just like we do. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436141528/ift45nd4aqeyumsktqea.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>While we are enjoying what iPhone brings to our life, it always seems to run out of battery in no
time due to our apps, videos and music, which makes us go in  panic as to
where or when we can find next power source, or makes us carry additional
accessories such as charging USB cables or power banks. </p>
<p>Also, we thought
about music lovers that sometimes forget, lose or even break their earphones when they are on the go.  From all that Snailink was inspired by
an idea of creating products make live simpler. </p>
<p>That's why we designed an<b>
innovational iPhone battery case</b> with built-in <b>auto-retractable
earphone</b> that lets users enjoy their music or personal calls anywhere, and
always have it with them, while it retracts back to its case when users are
done.   We called it: <b>EZtalk Battery Case </b>for iPhone 6.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436106025/egnjfacwqntuwjnphgjf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>EZtalk Battery Case</b> also made charging becomes so much easier by a simple push of a
button, which allows users to choose whether to charge or save some energy for when they need it most. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Why You Should Try EZtalk<br/>
</h2>Upon creating <b>EZtalk Battery Case</b> it allows users to <b>avoid cellular radiation</b> because of our auto-retractable earphone.  We knew that we had something special on our hands, something we must share with the world.  The one and only iPhone case which combines <b>power bank</b> and <b>auto-retractable earphone</b>, also <b>protection for the iPhone</b> from bumps and buries! How awesome is that!</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<br/><p></p>
<h2>
<b>From EZtalk to EZtalk Plus</b><br/>
</h2>
<div>And For those who use iPhone 6 Plus, instead of iPhone 6, we have heard your voice.  Snailink team are now proudly introducing  <b>EZtalk Plus</b>, which is even more amazing than EZtalk Battery Case.<p></p>

SNAILINK

Before EZtalk, it comes Snailink 
Snailink is a high-quality mobile accessory brand created for iPhone.  At Snailnk we LOVE creating cool innovational products for people who
live and breathe technology just like we do. 




While we are enjoying what iPhone brings to our life, it always seems to run out of battery in no
time due to our apps, videos and music, which makes us go in  panic as to
where or when we can find next power source, or makes us carry additional
accessories such as charging USB cables or power banks. 
Also, we thought
about music lovers that sometimes forget, lose or even break their earphones when they are on the go.  From all that Snailink was inspired by
an idea of creating products make live simpler. 
That's why we designed an
innovational iPhone battery case with built-in auto-retractable
earphone that lets users enjoy their music or personal calls anywhere, and
always have it with them, while it retracts back to its case when users are
done.   We called it: EZtalk Battery Case for iPhone 6.




EZtalk Battery Case also made charging becomes so much easier by a simple push of a
button, which allows users to choose whether to charge or save some energy for when they need it most. 


Why You Should Try EZtalk
Upon creating EZtalk Battery Case it allows users to avoid cellular radiation because of our auto-retractable earphone.  We knew that we had something special on our hands, something we must share with the world.  The one and only iPhone case which combines power bank and auto-retractable earphone, also protection for the iPhone from bumps and buries! How awesome is that!


From EZtalk to EZtalk Plus

And For those who use iPhone 6 Plus, instead of iPhone 6, we have heard your voice.  Snailink team are now proudly introducing  EZtalk Plus, which is even more amazing than EZtalk Battery Case.







Features of EZtalk Plus
Made of industry leading polycarbonate materials,
providing protection surrounding the iPhone while guarding it against everyday accidents. And it is still slim and light, so it's easy to hold on the palm while the back of the case provides
protection for lens from scratches.  Furthermore, we designed a leather cover on EZtalk Plus, so it's now even more protective for your phone. The LED indicator
displays the battery level and charging status while doubles your battery life with a simple push.Pulling out the built-in earphone, the audio port at the bottom of the case will immediately redirect and amplify sound from the native phone speaker to the earphone, which means that you can answer calls by simply pulling out the earphone. Of course, you can still use your personal audio devices by removing the audio switch and plugging them in.

The custom earphone provides Hi-Fi audio experiences. EZtalk tangle-free cable integrates an
in-line microphone providing a friendly hands-free user experience for private calls, and its
detachable function for music and movies.  Pull the earphone out to any convenient length where they'll lock into place. When
finished, push the button on the earphone to retract it neatly back into the slot at the bottom of the case.  Once the earphone being retracted, the audio switch will deactivate it, so that you won't miss any notification from native phone speaker.
For travelers and business users, it provides them slots for their ejector pin and SIM card where ever they go.  What's more,  we designed space for cards on EZtalk Plus with leather cover.

</h3>The H3J C series control surfaces are physical control surfaces that work like and resemble traditional broadcast switcher control surfaces.  Where we differ is we can control more than one manufacturer at the same time.  We also allow you to completely configure every button on the control surface.<br/><br/>And our most important feature, we can control software based video switchers like Wirecast and vMix.  We are the first purpose built video switching device that works out of the box with software based switchers.<br/><p></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>The Story</h3><p>Here's a story....  Our background is in video production and up until over a year ago everything we did was done with physical devices like Grass Valley or Black Magic Design switchers.</p><p>Over a year ago we decided to start a Video Podcasting network.  When we started to look at how to improve our production and streaming we learned about software based switchers.  We settled in on Wirecast as the solution.</p><p>However, we still maintained the physical ATEM switcher.  This created a complex workflow and 2 different video switchers to control for our production.</p><p>Plus, if you have used a software based switcher, it is not the same as pressing a physical button, the tactile feedback is missing and it requires some attention to what you are doing.</p><p>That started the quest to piece together a tool that could control both switchers from a single interface and it be a physical control surface.  We found lots of tools that use things like a midi control surface.  We even adapted them so they could control both the ATEM and Wirecast.</p><p>Sounds like we found a solution, right?  Well, it worked but not very well and was still not the same as the broadcast control surfaces we like so much.</p><p>So, as the story goes, we developed our own physical platform that uses the broadcast quality buttons and is much more reliable than the midi controllers that are frequently used.</p><p>And the story continues because we had now developed a physical solution to one of the most common complaints about software-based switchers.  And in the process we created a multi-vendor solution that can control multiple vendors simultaneously from the same control surface.</p><p>And that is just the beginning of the story.<br/></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Features</h3><p>Here are the features of each model broken down separately.</p><h4>C100</h4><ul>

</ul><br/><p></p><h3>Software Switchers</h3><p>So why have we singled out software switchers here?  Unlike the hardware switchers that have the nice control surfaces, software switchers have never had anything like a physical control surface before.</p><p>With the video streaming or video podcasting taking off in the last few years there are lots of people that are using a software based switcher and wondering if there is not a better way.</p><p>We feel this is a market in need of something amazing to help with the software based switchers and lack of physical control.  With a physical controller you do not need to look at the software or even the screen.  The control surface is a familiar feel and it has a visual feedback as to the state of the switcher without the need of a monitor.</p><p>We currently can work with:<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/351678/files/20140205143734-switcherbrands.png?1391639854"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>How Can You Help?</h3><p>This is where you come in.  We already have the prototypes done and working, we use them live in our shows daily.  So we are not in need of any funding for more development for the initial release.</p><p>What we are in need of is some automation tools that will allow us to produce the units quick and more accurately.</p><p>For now we have been manually placing solder on the board and placing parts.  Then we cook the boards in a reflow oven to mount all the tiny surface mount parts.</p><p>As part of this campaign we are going to purchase a machine called a pick and place machine that will place the parts much more accurately and much faster than we can.</p><p>We also want to do a bulk purchase of some of the parts.  The buttons we are using take 6 - 8 weeks from the time we order them to get to us.  We want to order in bulk more than what we really need so we can build up an inventory.</p><p>There are other things we need to do as well like build up a support infrastructure so that we can support the users of our products.</p><p>So by getting a perk you are helping us get things started up for production and support.</p><p>And as a thank you, we are going to offer great discounts to you our supporters.<br/></p><br/><h3>The models</h3><p>For this campaign we have 2 models.  Both models can control all 3 of the video switchers.  These are the first 2 models in our C line of control surfaces.  By the way, the ""C"" stands for console.  See below for the details on each.  <br/></p><h4><br/></h4><h4>C100</h4><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/354485/files/20140206195229-IMG_1295.jpg?1391745149"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; cursor: nw-resize;""/><br/></p></div><p>The C100 is our entry level in the console series of video control surfaces.  It still has the exact same ""guts"" as the C200 so all of the features like the multiple video switchers and the complex workflow still work perfectly.</p><p>The C100 is geared more toward the software based switcher user that is budget conscious. <br/></p><p>The C100 has 20 broadcast quality dual color (red/green) buttons.  The buttons are designed to resemble a traditional program / preview switcher.  You can change how and what those buttons do in the web configuration.</p><p>There are 4 buttons outside of the program / preview area that would typically be something like take and/or auto.  You can make them whatever you want.</p><p></p><h4><br/></h4><h4>C200</h4><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/351686/files/20140205144042-affordablec200.png?1391640042"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The C200 is the next step up from the C100.  The C200 adds some additional functionality to the C100 and adds in some more buttons and a T-bar.<p></p><p></p><p>The C200 also upgrades the buttons to what we like to call the ""premium"" broadcast buttons.  These buttons are full color RGB and are 17mm in size vs the 15mm of the C100.</p><p>The C200 has 33 of the premium buttons.  They are arranged in the same program / preview design with an extra row above the program bus.  We also added some user buttons to the right of the T-bar.</p><p>Beyond the program/preview there are 17 additional buttons that you can setup to do just about anything.</p><p>The C200 has a T-bar controller that uses a Hall Effect sensor to make it smooth.</p><p>We also added an LCD to the C200 so that you can make changes during a show without having to go to the web interface.  There are 2 rotary encoders that you use to navigate the menus.</p><p>When not in the menus, the rotary encoders can be used to make adjusts to things like fade time, etc.  This is of course dependent on which switcher you are using and if it supports it.</p><p>And there is still more, the C200 also has some additional I/O that the C100 does not have.</p><p>The C200 has a MIDI out that can be used for just about anything.  We plan on even more MIDI features in future releases too.  It also has a serial output that can be connected to things like an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, etc.  You can use your imagination on all of the things that can be done with that.</p><p>And lastly, we also added 3 GPIO ports to the C200 that can be used to perform functions on your switcher when there is a contact closure.<br/></p><br/><h3>It's All About The Buttons</h3><p>People put a lot of emphasis on how buttons feel.  We looked long and hard for the ones we really liked.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/351683/files/20140205144000-broadcastbuttons.png?1391640000"" src="""" style=""width: 520.912px; height: 177px;""/></p><br/><p></p><h3>A Little About The Design</h3><p>So let's talk about some of the things we decided when we were designing these devices.</p><p>First, we wanted it to be modular.  Each button board was designed so that it can be used in any location just by setting the board address.  We also designed the boards so they can handle different layouts without any problem.</p><p>By making the boards modular, we can create custom designs based on requests, we can re-use the same parts in our future designs as well.</p><p>We wanted to use designs that are well known and common.  This allows for finding parts that are common and also allows our designs to be ""hackable"".  And yes we are happy that the design is hackable, that was part of the goal as well.</p><p>For the C100 and C200 designs we used an Arduino Mega.  We did this because it allows us the ability to make changes and custom solutions quickly.  It is also a common off the shelf piece of hardware that can be replaced quickly at those inopportune moments when something fails.</p><p>The Arduino Mega is plenty powerful enough to handle all of the functions nicely.<br/></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><br/><p></p><h3>Our Timeline</h3><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/354453/files/20140206193535-Screen_Shot_2014-02-06_at_10.34.42_PM.png?1391744135"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>Here is a summary of our planned timeline.<p></p><p>The campaign starts on February 7th.  The campaign is set to run for 45 days.</p><p>We are working on creating some testing jigs that will speed up our testing of the boards once they are made.  We have some custom designed PC Boards being made and think we will have them by early March to assemble.</p><p>The campaign ends on March 24th.  When the campaign ends we will know how many of each unit we will need to manufacture.  We will put together the parts list and place the orders for the parts on March 25th.</p><p>On the 26th, we will place the order for the pick and place machine.  We are still unsure of the speed of delivery of this machine.</p><p>Our typical delivery time on PC boards is 2 - 3 weeks; we expect we would have them back by the 21st of April.  Assuming we have the pick and place machine, we can start assembling the surface mount parts onto the PC boards.  Once the surface mount parts are on the board, we can use the testing jigs to make sure all the parts are properly placed.  The PC boards are then ready and waiting for when the buttons arrive.</p><p>If the buttons take the entire 8 weeks to arrive, that places us into the May 26th time frame.  At that point we will solder the buttons onto the PC boards and test them again.</p><p>The next step is assembling all parts into the chassis and do some more testing.</p><p>Last step is sending the perks out to our backers.</p><p>There is the possibility depending on the number of perks that are taken that we could do a mid campaign order of parts.  As long as we reach the quantity that gets us the best deal we may do that in trying to get your perks to you quicker.</p><p>That means that the early bird perks would be first on the list to get those, hint hint.<br/></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Risks And Challenges</h3><p>With any project there are risks and challenges, in the case of the C100 and C200 the designs are done and they are being used in production environments every day.</p><p>We do not expect and hardware changes on these 2 models before production.  <br/></p><p>We are still working on the Wirecast client for the Mac.  We expect that to be completed before the end of the funding campaign.  The Wirecast client for Windows is done and is what we use daily.</p><p>The largest challenge we have is the time in sourcing the buttons themselves.  They are basically manufactured for use when we order them.  Our last order of buttons took almost 7 weeks and we were told between 6 and 8 weeks for both of our previous orders.<br/></p><h3><br/></h3><br/><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><h4>What do you mean by easily hackable?</h4><p>This hackable term scares people these days with all of the problems around computer security.  However, we are not referring to that kind of hacking.</p><p>In the maker community the hackable means you can make changes easily to a product.  For example, we produce a show called Let's Make It on the tech-zen.tv network where we make things with Arduinos and other small CPUs.</p><p>With our design, if you are a tinkerer that is familiar with Arduino you could make our control surface do all kinds of things that we did not build in.</p><p>That is how we are using the term hackable.  It is a good thing.<br/></p><h4><br/></h4><h4>Is there a rack mount version?</h4><p><span><span>We
 have been surprised how many people have asked us this. The answer is 
we will. We have designs for rack mount solutions (R series), desktop 
solutions (D Series) and even a small version we are calling the mini 
internally. Keep an eye out for new stuff.				</span></span><br/></p><h4><br/></h4><h4>Can I get a customized version?</h4><p><span><span>Absolutely,
 we are designers and makers and can design something just for your 
needs. We work with a local provider for our chassis and the PC boards 
are all modular. If you can dream, we can make it. </span></span></p><p>However, that being said, it is beyond the scope of the Indiegogo campaign for custom designs.  You would need to contact us directly at h3j.com.<br/></p><h4><br/></h4><h4>Do you take resellers?</h4><p>We will, absolutely.  We are not taking them until the end of the Indiegogo campaign for a couple of reasons.  We did not feel it would be fair to a reseller if we were offering the consoles at close to what they would get them for.  There is no incentive for a reseller until after the campaign completes.</p><p>That is also an indication at how good of a discount we are offering on the perks for the early bird buyers.<br/></p><h4><br/></h4><h4>Can it control more than one switcher at once?</h4><p><span><span>Absolutely,
 it can communicate with all compatible switchers at one time. In the 
configuration you need to setup which switcher is the priority for tally
 on a per button basis. It works great in complex workflow environments.
 Look at the complex workflow examples under solutions.				</span></span><br/></p><h4><br/></h4><h4>Can you control.... ?</h4><p><span><span>This
 is a very popular question since we announced the control surfaces. The
 simple answer is probably yes, as long as there is an API or MIDI 
interface. We are currently working with 2 other software providers and 
have a couple more we would love to work with.				</span></span><br/></p><h4><br/></h4><h4>How do you connect to Wirecast?</h4><p><span><span>All
 of the current vendors are controlled via Ethernet. For Wirecast we

The H3J C series control surfaces are physical control surfaces that work like and resemble traditional broadcast switcher control surfaces.  Where we differ is we can control more than one manufacturer at the same time.  We also allow you to completely configure every button on the control surface.And our most important feature, we can control software based video switchers like Wirecast and vMix.  We are the first purpose built video switching device that works out of the box with software based switchers.The StoryHere's a story....  Our background is in video production and up until over a year ago everything we did was done with physical devices like Grass Valley or Black Magic Design switchers.Over a year ago we decided to start a Video Podcasting network.  When we started to look at how to improve our production and streaming we learned about software based switchers.  We settled in on Wirecast as the solution.However, we still maintained the physical ATEM switcher.  This created a complex workflow and 2 different video switchers to control for our production.Plus, if you have used a software based switcher, it is not the same as pressing a physical button, the tactile feedback is missing and it requires some attention to what you are doing.That started the quest to piece together a tool that could control both switchers from a single interface and it be a physical control surface.  We found lots of tools that use things like a midi control surface.  We even adapted them so they could control both the ATEM and Wirecast.Sounds like we found a solution, right?  Well, it worked but not very well and was still not the same as the broadcast control surfaces we like so much.So, as the story goes, we developed our own physical platform that uses the broadcast quality buttons and is much more reliable than the midi controllers that are frequently used.And the story continues because we had now developed a physical solution to one of the most common complaints about software-based switchers.  And in the process we created a multi-vendor solution that can control multiple vendors simultaneously from the same control surface.And that is just the beginning of the story.FeaturesHere are the features of each model broken down separately.C100

Software SwitchersSo why have we singled out software switchers here?  Unlike the hardware switchers that have the nice control surfaces, software switchers have never had anything like a physical control surface before.With the video streaming or video podcasting taking off in the last few years there are lots of people that are using a software based switcher and wondering if there is not a better way.We feel this is a market in need of something amazing to help with the software based switchers and lack of physical control.  With a physical controller you do not need to look at the software or even the screen.  The control surface is a familiar feel and it has a visual feedback as to the state of the switcher without the need of a monitor.We currently can work with:How Can You Help?This is where you come in.  We already have the prototypes done and working, we use them live in our shows daily.  So we are not in need of any funding for more development for the initial release.What we are in need of is some automation tools that will allow us to produce the units quick and more accurately.For now we have been manually placing solder on the board and placing parts.  Then we cook the boards in a reflow oven to mount all the tiny surface mount parts.As part of this campaign we are going to purchase a machine called a pick and place machine that will place the parts much more accurately and much faster than we can.We also want to do a bulk purchase of some of the parts.  The buttons we are using take 6 - 8 weeks from the time we order them to get to us.  We want to order in bulk more than what we really need so we can build up an inventory.There are other things we need to do as well like build up a support infrastructure so that we can support the users of our products.So by getting a perk you are helping us get things started up for production and support.And as a thank you, we are going to offer great discounts to you our supporters.The modelsFor this campaign we have 2 models.  Both models can control all 3 of the video switchers.  These are the first 2 models in our C line of control surfaces.  By the way, the ""C"" stands for console.  See below for the details on each.  C100The C100 is our entry level in the console series of video control surfaces.  It still has the exact same ""guts"" as the C200 so all of the features like the multiple video switchers and the complex workflow still work perfectly.The C100 is geared more toward the software based switcher user that is budget conscious. The C100 has 20 broadcast quality dual color (red/green) buttons.  The buttons are designed to resemble a traditional program / preview switcher.  You can change how and what those buttons do in the web configuration.There are 4 buttons outside of the program / preview area that would typically be something like take and/or auto.  You can make them whatever you want.C200The C200 is the next step up from the C100.  The C200 adds some additional functionality to the C100 and adds in some more buttons and a T-bar.The C200 also upgrades the buttons to what we like to call the ""premium"" broadcast buttons.  These buttons are full color RGB and are 17mm in size vs the 15mm of the C100.The C200 has 33 of the premium buttons.  They are arranged in the same program / preview design with an extra row above the program bus.  We also added some user buttons to the right of the T-bar.Beyond the program/preview there are 17 additional buttons that you can setup to do just about anything.The C200 has a T-bar controller that uses a Hall Effect sensor to make it smooth.We also added an LCD to the C200 so that you can make changes during a show without having to go to the web interface.  There are 2 rotary encoders that you use to navigate the menus.When not in the menus, the rotary encoders can be used to make adjusts to things like fade time, etc.  This is of course dependent on which switcher you are using and if it supports it.And there is still more, the C200 also has some additional I/O that the C100 does not have.The C200 has a MIDI out that can be used for just about anything.  We plan on even more MIDI features in future releases too.  It also has a serial output that can be connected to things like an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, etc.  You can use your imagination on all of the things that can be done with that.And lastly, we also added 3 GPIO ports to the C200 that can be used to perform functions on your switcher when there is a contact closure.It's All About The ButtonsPeople put a lot of emphasis on how buttons feel.  We looked long and hard for the ones we really liked.A Little About The DesignSo let's talk about some of the things we decided when we were designing these devices.First, we wanted it to be modular.  Each button board was designed so that it can be used in any location just by setting the board address.  We also designed the boards so they can handle different layouts without any problem.By making the boards modular, we can create custom designs based on requests, we can re-use the same parts in our future designs as well.We wanted to use designs that are well known and common.  This allows for finding parts that are common and also allows our designs to be ""hackable"".  And yes we are happy that the design is hackable, that was part of the goal as well.For the C100 and C200 designs we used an Arduino Mega.  We did this because it allows us the ability to make changes and custom solutions quickly.  It is also a common off the shelf piece of hardware that can be replaced quickly at those inopportune moments when something fails.The Arduino Mega is plenty powerful enough to handle all of the functions nicely.Our TimelineHere is a summary of our planned timeline.The campaign starts on February 7th.  The campaign is set to run for 45 days.We are working on creating some testing jigs that will speed up our testing of the boards once they are made.  We have some custom designed PC Boards being made and think we will have them by early March to assemble.The campaign ends on March 24th.  When the campaign ends we will know how many of each unit we will need to manufacture.  We will put together the parts list and place the orders for the parts on March 25th.On the 26th, we will place the order for the pick and place machine.  We are still unsure of the speed of delivery of this machine.Our typical delivery time on PC boards is 2 - 3 weeks; we expect we would have them back by the 21st of April.  Assuming we have the pick and place machine, we can start assembling the surface mount parts onto the PC boards.  Once the surface mount parts are on the board, we can use the testing jigs to make sure all the parts are properly placed.  The PC boards are then ready and waiting for when the buttons arrive.If the buttons take the entire 8 weeks to arrive, that places us into the May 26th time frame.  At that point we will solder the buttons onto the PC boards and test them again.The next step is assembling all parts into the chassis and do some more testing.Last step is sending the perks out to our backers.There is the possibility depending on the number of perks that are taken that we could do a mid campaign order of parts.  As long as we reach the quantity that gets us the best deal we may do that in trying to get your perks to you quicker.That means that the early bird perks would be first on the list to get those, hint hint.Risks And ChallengesWith any project there are risks and challenges, in the case of the C100 and C200 the designs are done and they are being used in production environments every day.We do not expect and hardware changes on these 2 models before production.  We are still working on the Wirecast client for the Mac.  We expect that to be completed before the end of the funding campaign.  The Wirecast client for Windows is done and is what we use daily.The largest challenge we have is the time in sourcing the buttons themselves.  They are basically manufactured for use when we order them.  Our last order of buttons took almost 7 weeks and we were told between 6 and 8 weeks for both of our previous orders.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat do you mean by easily hackable?This hackable term scares people these days with all of the problems around computer security.  However, we are not referring to that kind of hacking.In the maker community the hackable means you can make changes easily to a product.  For example, we produce a show called Let's Make It on the tech-zen.tv network where we make things with Arduinos and other small CPUs.With our design, if you are a tinkerer that is familiar with Arduino you could make our control surface do all kinds of things that we did not build in.That is how we are using the term hackable.  It is a good thing.Is there a rack mount version?We
 have been surprised how many people have asked us this. The answer is 
we will. We have designs for rack mount solutions (R series), desktop 
solutions (D Series) and even a small version we are calling the mini 
internally. Keep an eye out for new stuff.				Can I get a customized version?Absolutely,
 we are designers and makers and can design something just for your 
needs. We work with a local provider for our chassis and the PC boards 
are all modular. If you can dream, we can make it. However, that being said, it is beyond the scope of the Indiegogo campaign for custom designs.  You would need to contact us directly at h3j.com.Do you take resellers?We will, absolutely.  We are not taking them until the end of the Indiegogo campaign for a couple of reasons.  We did not feel it would be fair to a reseller if we were offering the consoles at close to what they would get them for.  There is no incentive for a reseller until after the campaign completes.That is also an indication at how good of a discount we are offering on the perks for the early bird buyers.Can it control more than one switcher at once?Absolutely,
 it can communicate with all compatible switchers at one time. In the 
configuration you need to setup which switcher is the priority for tally
 on a per button basis. It works great in complex workflow environments.
 Look at the complex workflow examples under solutions.				Can you control.... ?This
 is a very popular question since we announced the control surfaces. The
 simple answer is probably yes, as long as there is an API or MIDI 
interface. We are currently working with 2 other software providers and 
have a couple more we would love to work with.				How do you connect to Wirecast?All
 of the current vendors are controlled via Ethernet. For Wirecast we 
have a small program that runs on the same machine as Wirecast that 
interfaces with our hardware. This small piece of software also has lots
 of additional features we have added to enhance the experience.				What is this Wirecast Remote software?Because Wirecast does not have a built in network based API we had to develop a small application that bridges the Ethernet network that are control surface uses to the Wirecast API.We currently have the Windows version completed and in beta and are creating the version for Mac OSX now.We have also added some additional functionality to this small application that makes it useful for even those that do not have our hardware solutions.Here is a video that shows what all this software can do:How much does Wirecast Remote cost?Zero,
 Nada, $0, you get the idea. The software can be downloaded for FREE. It
 has features that can be used with Wirecast even without our hardware 
interfaces. What about Tally?The C100 and C200 report back tally information via the LED indicators on each button.If you are referring to an external tally to the C100 and C200, someone must have been giving some secrets about what we are testing.  All we can say is keep an ear to the ground and visit the h3j.com site often.What do you mean by a complex workflow?This is an excellent question.  Below is an image of how our workflow is configured.  It is a great example of a complex workflow.  Our control surfaces can control this complex switching environment from a single control surface.  There is no need to control each switcher individually.Learn MoreIf you want to learn more go to h3j.com.  We are working on new videos and content all the time.  We are also setting up a forum for the community surrounding the h3j.com products.You can also find the Wirecast Remote software.  It is free to download.  Just remember it is still in beta so you can expect problems every now and then.Here are some videos that show the control surface in action in different situations.The C200 controlling WirecastThe C200 Controlling an ATEMThe C200 in a Complex Workflow

<p>this is a project I
belive in. its called the karabow quantum. it is a phone that uses nano
electricity to charge itself. it means that you don't need to charge this phone
for the next five years. with karabow quantum, just keep playing, keep working
until you are tied. Karabowuses the nana particles that can assorb electricity
and tansform it to nana electricity called the piezo electic.</p>
<p>Design</p>
<p>Karabow quantum (eco
phone) is an innovative  trendy GSM
phone that integrated with a Bluetooth headset, Bluetooth Dialer, as well as
smart watch technology that you don't need to charge for five years. This new
technology allows users to sync the Nano electricity with a Android smart
phone’s for new Gmail notification, Google calendar events, call history,
phonebook, as well as sent and received SMS messages. Leave the large,
burdensome smart phone in your bag or at home when traveling light. you don't
have to worry about you power any more</p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>The Karabow quantum is
not only a  mobile phone that can be used
with any standard SIM card, without having to subscribe to a contract. For
those who travel a lot or have more than one SIM card, the Karabow quantum
functions as a great backup. Avoid buying another large, weighty phone or
fumbling around with multiple SIM cards. Start taking advantage of the Karabow
quantum’s tiny size, powerful functions, and colorful appeal.</p>
<p>The Karabow quantum
can sync with smart phone, downloading phonebook and call history (iOS 4.0+ and
Android 2.4+) to Karabow quantum. When using Android 2.3+ OS, download and
install the WiMe Nano Smart APK on the Android device and the Karabow quantum
will sync with the Android device (Google calendar events, new Gmail notification,
call history, phonebook, sent/received SMS).</p>
<p>With its embedded
stereo music chip, the Karabow quantum provides stereo MP3 sound, allowing
users to enjoy high-quality sound.</p>
<p>Listening to music
from FM radio is another good way to relax the soul. Plug in an earphone and
start listening with the Nano Phone.</p>
<p>Karabow quantum acts
as a Bluetooth headset and dialer, and can pair with most Bluetooth devices,
functioning as a wireless Bluetooth headset.</p>
<p>Misplaced a smart
phone around the house, forgot it at a restaurant, or worried of theft? Karabow
quantum can also function as a Bluetooth dialer that uses the Karabow quantum
technology to dial the linked smart phone as long as the Bluetooth connection
has been made.</p>
<p>this phone is also
part of the green campaign because it helps conserve electric power for other
usage. nana phone removes the burden of low power on your device and give you a
power pack battery.</p>

<h1><br/></h1><div><br/></div><p> </p></div>","KARABOW QUANTUM  (The future is here)
this is a project I
belive in. its called the karabow quantum. it is a phone that uses nano
electricity to charge itself. it means that you don't need to charge this phone
for the next five years. with karabow quantum, just keep playing, keep working
until you are tied. Karabowuses the nana particles that can assorb electricity
and tansform it to nana electricity called the piezo electic.
Design
Karabow quantum (eco
phone) is an innovative  trendy GSM
phone that integrated with a Bluetooth headset, Bluetooth Dialer, as well as
smart watch technology that you don't need to charge for five years. This new
technology allows users to sync the Nano electricity with a Android smart
phone’s for new Gmail notification, Google calendar events, call history,
phonebook, as well as sent and received SMS messages. Leave the large,
burdensome smart phone in your bag or at home when traveling light. you don't
have to worry about you power any more
Features
The Karabow quantum is
not only a  mobile phone that can be used
with any standard SIM card, without having to subscribe to a contract. For
those who travel a lot or have more than one SIM card, the Karabow quantum
functions as a great backup. Avoid buying another large, weighty phone or
fumbling around with multiple SIM cards. Start taking advantage of the Karabow
quantum’s tiny size, powerful functions, and colorful appeal.
The Karabow quantum
can sync with smart phone, downloading phonebook and call history (iOS 4.0+ and
Android 2.4+) to Karabow quantum. When using Android 2.3+ OS, download and
install the WiMe Nano Smart APK on the Android device and the Karabow quantum
will sync with the Android device (Google calendar events, new Gmail notification,
call history, phonebook, sent/received SMS).
With its embedded
stereo music chip, the Karabow quantum provides stereo MP3 sound, allowing
users to enjoy high-quality sound.
Listening to music
from FM radio is another good way to relax the soul. Plug in an earphone and
start listening with the Nano Phone.
Karabow quantum acts
as a Bluetooth headset and dialer, and can pair with most Bluetooth devices,
functioning as a wireless Bluetooth headset.
Misplaced a smart
phone around the house, forgot it at a restaurant, or worried of theft? Karabow
quantum can also function as a Bluetooth dialer that uses the Karabow quantum
technology to dial the linked smart phone as long as the Bluetooth connection
has been made.
this phone is also
part of the green campaign because it helps conserve electric power for other
usage. nana phone removes the burden of low power on your device and give you a
power pack battery.

<p>As the industry of personal smart devices is thriving in the modern world, there is an increase in the number of gadgets that individuals own and use every day. At Artellia, we set off on a journey to design a <span>one-stop solution</span> to satisfy the needs of <span>charging multiple devices</span> at ease. Multifunctionality was not the only objective, as the world prompts users with higher charging efficiency. We aim to provide not only charging capability, but also efficiency. </p>
<p><span>Artellia Monno</span> was kickstarted by an idea of blending smart home technology into everyday household unobtrusively through design. The <span>5-in-1 charging station</span> provides a one-stop solution for <span>tethered</span>, <span>wirelessly charged</span>, and <span>wearable</span> devices. User safety is prioritized and it is safeguarded by the active heat dissipation system. The design ensures ease-of-use and a carefree experience for users. It’s the fastest <span>35W</span> wireless charger on the market, with 7 coils technology that can charge up to 5 devices simultaneously.</p>

I was recently chosen by Google to purchase the Google Glass. This gadget could contribute immensely to my research due to its easiness of collecting sound and pictures. Carrying around a digital camera and a voice recorder has been quite risky since favelas are zones of high crime and theft.</p>
<p>Google Glass is more discrete and small, which could call less attention than carrying cameras and recorders.</p>
<p>My budget for this research is very limit, and I can’t afford the Glass on my own, and for that I ask for your help!</p>

<b>I. <u>Our goal</u></b><br/>
</h2>
<p><b><i>BE A GLOBAL CITIZEN OF
YOUR TIME! WE OFFER THE MOST AMBITIOUS NEXT GENERATION TELECOMMUNICATION
TECHNOLOGY!</i></b></p>
<p>We try to realize the
<b>most complete online TV channels platform</b> bringing together hundreds of
channels from all over the world and we want to offer access to such
one-of-a-kind service to millions of people. Our platform will be available on
any transmission device. </p>
<p>Are
you <b>away from
home, working in another country, home-sick?</b><br/><b>Do you miss your <i>Greek </i>holiday</b> <span>and yearn to hear some more Greek language shows?<br/>
Are you secretly <b>learning a
foreign language</b> by watching tons of TV
shows in that language?<br/>
Imagine a point in time when you can view your
favorite TV show on any kind of
device, anywhere in the world. You can watch your favorite UK channel on
your laptop or smartphone while on a business trip to Australia or you can
watch your favorite French TV show while you are in a train
from Madrid to Lisbon. The possibilities are endless. That time is
now.</span></p>
<p><b>CONTRIBUTE
NOW and join us realize this ambitious and unique project</b> that may change the
television industry, making it more and more penetrant and popular by being
viewed of tens of million of people all over the world!! </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>II. <u>Who
we are and we've done so far</u></b></h3>
<p>We are a passionate
team dabbling in telecommunication technologies for quite a few years now. <span>These years witnessed our mobile TV and web TV
platform being used by millions of people from all around the globe.
That's not all we do, but this platform is the main focus of this campaign.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>All
the channels we stream are available on:</b><br/>
  - computers/Laptops (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X);<br/>
  - tablets (Android, iPad);<br/>
  - phones (Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, Blackberry, Nokia feature
phones – you name it);<br/>
  - TV set-top-boxes (STBs);<br/>
  - smart TVs (Samsung, Sony, LG)</p>
<p>What's best is that
every device gets its own stream, adapted to the device's video playing
abilities. This way, for instance, your smart TV will get a full HD stream
where available, while your older model mobile phone will get the same channel
in a lower video size, adapted to its own screen and internet speed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Our
proof of concept results:</b></p>

<span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""></span><b>Now it is time to expand, with your contribution:</b>
</h4>
<p><b>First phase</b>: we aim to expand the platform's available channels by adding <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">the most relevant channels </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">from most European and African countries.</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Second phase</b>: we aim to further expand our playlist to cover Asia, Australia and the American continents.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Upon expanding the tv channels network
we will always take into account your preferences to capture other channels of
interest for you and your communities.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>III. <u>What we need for doing the project</u>
</h3>
<p>We have developed this platform already for Romania through
PBXTV. However, in order to take it to the next level, we need your continued
encouragement, promotion for our platform and financial support from you and
all your friends. </p>
<p>The
funds will be used to:</p>
<p>- Expand
the array of satellite dishes so that we can down-link all the new channels;<br/>
- Expand the data-center capabilities to accommodate the viewing of all the new
channels, each channel in the multiple formats needed for each device.<br/>
- Add more virtual servers worldwide to increase our content delivery network
so that you will be able to automatically connect to the closest possible video
server - this way enjoying the smoothest, adapted, viewing experience.</p>
<p>In order to stream TV Channels
from all over the world we will create <b><u>3
main Datacenters</u></b>:</p>
<p>- One
in <b>Europe</b> covering also <b>African territory</b>;</p>
<p>- Second
in <b>The United States of America</b>
capturing also the <b>Central and South
Americas</b>; and</p>
<p>- The
last one in <b>Asia</b> that will cover
also <b>Australian continent</b> and <b>New Zeeland</b>. </p>
<h3><b>IV.<u> What You Get</u></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">1. We are offering 30% discounted long term subscriptions for those of you who fund us in this stage and believe in our service. Our subscriptions include unrestricted access to all channels available at the time of and during the subscription, plus special features such as re-runs (catchup) up to 7 days back and recording abilities on select devices. </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>2. We are also offering our own set-top-boxes which enable the viewer to view all the channels directly on one's TV set without the need of any other device.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3><b>V. <u>The impact</u></b></h3>
<p>We
intend to bring order to a chaotic ecosystem. There are thousands of floating
video streams out there. Each in its own, unique and unadapted format. We are
planning to streamline everything by encoding all the channels at the same
quality level while at multiple video sizes, and to bring everything into one
place where you KNOW that it always works and where you can enjoy the same
great quality across all channels and devices. All this while at the lowest
possible prices. 

</p>
<h3><b><span>VI. <u>Main advantages</u></span></b></h3>
<p>1.  <span>You
can access as <b><u>many different channels as you wish</u></b> and you have
the <b><u>flexibility to change them on a monthly basis</u></b>, <b><u>increase
or decrease their number.</u></b></span></p>
<p>2. <b><u>All channels</u></b> will be received by
you at the <b><u>same quality and resolution.</u></b></p>
<p>3. Watch all channels through <b><u>any existing
device, TV Set, laptop, desktop, mobile phones or tablets</u></b> and see:</p>
<p>- sports events – championships </p>
<p>- music and film awards</p>
<p>- news and politics</p>
<p>- TV shows </p>
<p>4. W<span>atch the
channels at <b><u>any place you are</u></b>, either you are travelling in a
long distance train, or if you travel by car with your family or simply relax
fishing or camping in the woods.</span></p>
<p>5. <b><u>R<span>e-run</span></u></b> of selected programs making possible watching news or
shows broadcasted at different time zones.</p>
<p>6. <b><u>Lower subscription fees than those of
the cable operators</u></b> in your own country and easy to pay them on-line
from any place in the world.</p>
<p>7. <b><u>E<span>asy termination of the
subscription</span></u></b> at any time with <b><u>no
penalties</u></b>.</p>
<p><b><i>- CONTRIBUTE NOW AND LET’S DO
THIS UNIQUE PROJECT TOGETHER!! -</i></b></p>
<h3><b>VII. <u>Social benefits</u></b></h3>
<p>We want to develop this new TV Channels platform to
offer comfort to those who miss the most to listen to their native language and
be in contact with the news back home.</p>
<p>We want to solve the problems we’ve learned from our
friends, relatives and many other people asking us to help them watch live
their favorite channels while they no longer live in their own countries -
temporary immigrants or people working abroad in embassies, various
organizations, multi-national companies.</p>
<p>If you join us realize this ambitious dream we can
also help others:</p>
<p>- the students studying abroad could be in touch
with the realities from their homelands;</p>
<p>- <span>the volunteers going to Africa to
show much about his own country to the Masai tribes;</span></p>

BE A GLOBAL CITIZEN OF
YOUR TIME! WE OFFER THE MOST AMBITIOUS NEXT GENERATION TELECOMMUNICATION
TECHNOLOGY!
We try to realize the
most complete online TV channels platform bringing together hundreds of
channels from all over the world and we want to offer access to such
one-of-a-kind service to millions of people. Our platform will be available on
any transmission device. 
Are
you away from
home, working in another country, home-sick?Do you miss your Greek holiday and yearn to hear some more Greek language shows?
Are you secretly learning a
foreign language by watching tons of TV
shows in that language?
Imagine a point in time when you can view your
favorite TV show on any kind of
device, anywhere in the world. You can watch your favorite UK channel on
your laptop or smartphone while on a business trip to Australia or you can
watch your favorite French TV show while you are in a train
from Madrid to Lisbon. The possibilities are endless. That time is
now.
CONTRIBUTE
NOW and join us realize this ambitious and unique project that may change the
television industry, making it more and more penetrant and popular by being
viewed of tens of million of people all over the world!! 


II. Who
we are and we've done so far
We are a passionate
team dabbling in telecommunication technologies for quite a few years now. These years witnessed our mobile TV and web TV
platform being used by millions of people from all around the globe.
That's not all we do, but this platform is the main focus of this campaign.

All
the channels we stream are available on:
  - computers/Laptops (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X);
  - tablets (Android, iPad);
  - phones (Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, Blackberry, Nokia feature
phones – you name it);
  - TV set-top-boxes (STBs);
  - smart TVs (Samsung, Sony, LG)
What's best is that
every device gets its own stream, adapted to the device's video playing
abilities. This way, for instance, your smart TV will get a full HD stream
where available, while your older model mobile phone will get the same channel
in a lower video size, adapted to its own screen and internet speed.

Our
proof of concept results:
-
over 300,000 PBX TV registered users in Romania;




The follow-up:

- over 100,000 downloads of PBX TV Android application;

- over 1,000,000 TV  access TV channels  / month;



Now it is time to expand, with your contribution:

First phase: we aim to expand the platform's available channels by adding the most relevant channels from most European and African countries.
Second phase: we aim to further expand our playlist to cover Asia, Australia and the American continents.

Upon expanding the tv channels network
we will always take into account your preferences to capture other channels of
interest for you and your communities.

III. What we need for doing the project

We have developed this platform already for Romania through
PBXTV. However, in order to take it to the next level, we need your continued
encouragement, promotion for our platform and financial support from you and
all your friends. 
The
funds will be used to:
- Expand
the array of satellite dishes so that we can down-link all the new channels;
- Expand the data-center capabilities to accommodate the viewing of all the new
channels, each channel in the multiple formats needed for each device.
- Add more virtual servers worldwide to increase our content delivery network
so that you will be able to automatically connect to the closest possible video
server - this way enjoying the smoothest, adapted, viewing experience.
In order to stream TV Channels
from all over the world we will create 3
main Datacenters:
- One
in Europe covering also African territory;
- Second
in The United States of America
capturing also the Central and South
Americas; and
- The
last one in Asia that will cover
also Australian continent and New Zeeland. 
IV. What You Get

1. We are offering 30% discounted long term subscriptions for those of you who fund us in this stage and believe in our service. Our subscriptions include unrestricted access to all channels available at the time of and during the subscription, plus special features such as re-runs (catchup) up to 7 days back and recording abilities on select devices. 

2. We are also offering our own set-top-boxes which enable the viewer to view all the channels directly on one's TV set without the need of any other device.


V. The impact
We
intend to bring order to a chaotic ecosystem. There are thousands of floating
video streams out there. Each in its own, unique and unadapted format. We are
planning to streamline everything by encoding all the channels at the same
quality level while at multiple video sizes, and to bring everything into one
place where you KNOW that it always works and where you can enjoy the same
great quality across all channels and devices. All this while at the lowest
possible prices. 


VI. Main advantages
1.  You
can access as many different channels as you wish and you have
the flexibility to change them on a monthly basis, increase
or decrease their number.
2. All channels will be received by
you at the same quality and resolution.
3. Watch all channels through any existing
device, TV Set, laptop, desktop, mobile phones or tablets and see:
- sports events – championships 
- music and film awards
- news and politics
- TV shows 
4. Watch the
channels at any place you are, either you are travelling in a
long distance train, or if you travel by car with your family or simply relax
fishing or camping in the woods.
5. Re-run of selected programs making possible watching news or
shows broadcasted at different time zones.
6. Lower subscription fees than those of
the cable operators in your own country and easy to pay them on-line
from any place in the world.
7. Easy termination of the
subscription at any time with no
penalties.
- CONTRIBUTE NOW AND LET’S DO
THIS UNIQUE PROJECT TOGETHER!! -
VII. Social benefits
We want to develop this new TV Channels platform to
offer comfort to those who miss the most to listen to their native language and
be in contact with the news back home.
We want to solve the problems we’ve learned from our
friends, relatives and many other people asking us to help them watch live
their favorite channels while they no longer live in their own countries -
temporary immigrants or people working abroad in embassies, various
organizations, multi-national companies.
If you join us realize this ambitious dream we can
also help others:
- the students studying abroad could be in touch
with the realities from their homelands;
- the volunteers going to Africa to
show much about his own country to the Masai tribes;
-  each
and every one of us going to holidays for several weeks away from home  to
stay tuned with the realities from our own countries
If you haven’t seen yet all the beautiful places in
the world, if you cannot travel soon in the destination you want to visit then directly connect
to the realities of such places by connecting to our platform and:
-  listen
to the local languages,
-  discover
the landscaping and the customs of each place;
-  walk
on virtual bridges to all places in the world

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>How long does the battery last?</b> 1-2 years depending on usage pattern. In our road map we are planning to use the power that's already there for the garage controller. Once that is done batteries will be optional.<br/></p>
<p><b>What is the maximum number of mobile devices we can use with a single Open Sesame device? </b>There is no limit on the number of mobile devices that can be used with a single Open Sesame device. But at a given time, you can use only one smart phone to operate your garage door. If you want to be able to use multiple smart phones to open/close your garage door simultaneously, you need to install multiple Open Sesame devices on the same garage door controller.</p>
<p><b>Does connecting Open Sesame to the garage door controller disable your existing garage remotes? </b>No. You can keep using your original remotes as usual.</p>
<p><b>Can you pair more than one Open Sesame to your mobile device? </b>Yes. This helps if you have a multiple-door garage.</p>
<p><b>What is the maximum distance from which garage door can be operated? </b>100 feet.</p>
<p><b>Is Open Sesame Mobile App free?</b> Yes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How to pair additional smart phones to the Open Sesame device?</b> - You can bring your phone close to your Open Sesame device and pair just like you paired it with the first mobile device. Also we are working on a feature where you can optionally pair it through an already paired mobile device. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Which garage door controller manufacturers do you support?</b> Open Sesame Garage Door Opener is a generic solution that can be used with pretty much any garage door controller that has a wall switch or a console</p>
<p><b>I have more than one garage door for my garage. Can Open Sesame operate all? </b>Yes. You would have to pair a separate Open Sesame device for each garage door controller for that.</p>
<p><b>Can Open Sesame app control garage doors of multiple homes? </b>Yes. If you attach a separate Open Sesame device to each garage door controller you can control all.</p>
<p><b>Does Open Sesame let me operate my garage door even when I am away from home via Internet? </b>You can operate your garage door only when you are in or around your home via bluetooth only. Open Sesame does not connect to Internet.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>What happens if I replace my mobile device? </b>Please keep the QR code and Password. You can set up your new smart phone with this security information. Alternatively with mobile pairing you can use another existing mobile device to set it up. If you lose your QR code/password and do not have another paired phone you can contact us.</p>
<p><b>Can Open Sesame tell me if my garage door is open or close? </b>At this point it does not. But we are considering adding this feature for future releases. </p>
<p><b>Will attaching Open Sesame to my garage door controller void its warranty?</b> No. Open Sesame acts like a 3rd party switch to your controller.</p>
<p><b>Is there a shipping cost?  </b>Shipping is free within the United States. International shipment fees apply.</p>
<p>If you have any questions that has not been answered here, please send it in to support@mygarageopener.com</p>

Open Sesame Garage Door Opener is a combination of two things. A tiny bluetooth box and a smart phone application that controls the garage door controller via bluetooth box.

Open Sesame easily and securely turns your smart phone in to a garage

We actually have working prototypes that we have even started using for
     ourselves. What we would like to do, with your help, is to take this
     product one step further and make it production ready and have it available to millions of smart phone users.WHERE WE ARE
At this point 80% of the manufacturing is already automated, we are working with our manufacturer back and forth to finalize the latest version of the prototype. At the same time we are working on security, robustness and reliability tests as we speak. So we are close to kicking off the official pilot programs with units fully manufactured by our manufacturer.We have an iPhone application working with the prototype, which is also used in the video we shot. Obviously it is not in the app store yet, we have to finalize the UI to make it all look good and add some more functionality to it.Lately with the release of iOS 8, there were couple issues that destabilized the app. We have worked on them and all is fixed now.With your support we will be able to make the app all shiny, easy to use and useful on the iPhone. Also will be able to start the Android app quickly right after iPhone version is completed. It usually takes a lot less time to port completed iOS apps to Android.


WHAT'S NEXT ?

Spend more time on testing and make the product rock solid that does what it says it does all the time without a flaw.
Fully automate the manufacturing process and start the pilot programs.

We would like to polish the packaging and make it look like more slick and neat. 


Be prepared to go to
production with higher volumes to be able to handle the demand


Re-skin our mobile
applications to make them look prettier. iPhone version is functional at this
point. We are kicking off the Android version soon as well.

Timeline - Our goal is to start shipping the first item in April of 2015.

  Not having to carry means you won't lose your original remote anymore, just leave it in the car all the time. Open Sesame will do it for you.

  You can pair all the smart phones in your household, it is like buying unlimited additional remotes for free

  Does not prevent you from using your original remote. You can still use your original remote along with Open Sesame just like before.
Low price/affordable
Very easy to install
No Wifi needed. Wifi setup takes more time and is more complex
Secure
HOW DOES IT WORK ?

TAP IT!


Tap your finger to open or close the garage doorOnce authentication and authorization process is successfully completed, your smart phone will save this device and connect to it. After attaching the device to your garage door controller you can open or close your garage door with just a tap of finger.



SECURITY

Every Open Sesame device has its unique QR Code. 


Every Open Sesame device has its own unique password. 

Nobody can pair it without the unique password. 

Nobody can use Open Sesame device without pairing. 


If Open Sesame receives wrong password connection attempts more than 10 times, then the device closes connection feature for a while. This time period is adjustable.

FAQ

How long does the battery last? 1-2 years depending on usage pattern. In our road map we are planning to use the power that's already there for the garage controller. Once that is done batteries will be optional.
What is the maximum number of mobile devices we can use with a single Open Sesame device? There is no limit on the number of mobile devices that can be used with a single Open Sesame device. But at a given time, you can use only one smart phone to operate your garage door. If you want to be able to use multiple smart phones to open/close your garage door simultaneously, you need to install multiple Open Sesame devices on the same garage door controller.
Does connecting Open Sesame to the garage door controller disable your existing garage remotes? No. You can keep using your original remotes as usual.
Can you pair more than one Open Sesame to your mobile device? Yes. This helps if you have a multiple-door garage.
What is the maximum distance from which garage door can be operated? 100 feet.
Is Open Sesame Mobile App free? Yes.

How to pair additional smart phones to the Open Sesame device? - You can bring your phone close to your Open Sesame device and pair just like you paired it with the first mobile device. Also we are working on a feature where you can optionally pair it through an already paired mobile device. 

Which garage door controller manufacturers do you support? Open Sesame Garage Door Opener is a generic solution that can be used with pretty much any garage door controller that has a wall switch or a console
I have more than one garage door for my garage. Can Open Sesame operate all? Yes. You would have to pair a separate Open Sesame device for each garage door controller for that.
Can Open Sesame app control garage doors of multiple homes? Yes. If you attach a separate Open Sesame device to each garage door controller you can control all.
Does Open Sesame let me operate my garage door even when I am away from home via Internet? You can operate your garage door only when you are in or around your home via bluetooth only. Open Sesame does not connect to Internet.


What happens if I replace my mobile device? Please keep the QR code and Password. You can set up your new smart phone with this security information. Alternatively with mobile pairing you can use another existing mobile device to set it up. If you lose your QR code/password and do not have another paired phone you can contact us.
Can Open Sesame tell me if my garage door is open or close? At this point it does not. But we are considering adding this feature for future releases. 
Will attaching Open Sesame to my garage door controller void its warranty? No. Open Sesame acts like a 3rd party switch to your controller.
Is there a shipping cost?  Shipping is free within the United States. International shipment fees apply.
If you have any questions that has not been answered here, please send it in to support@mygarageopener.com

<h1>The Birth of Amber</h1>
<p>Being Apple lovers, it’s no surprise that we got our hands on Apple Watch at its soonest available time. During the long awaited period, we actively discussed and brainstormed, how we could best charge it on the go.</p>
<p>It is our belief that an ideal power bank for Apple Watch should meet the following requirements: </p>
<ul>
<li>It must be able to charge Apple Watch on the go. With conventional power banks, the watch would easily disconnect from the magnetic connector – we knew we needed one that would securely hold it in place. </li>
<li>It would be able to power other devices as well, so we wouldn’t have to carry multiple power banks.</li>
</ul>
<p>From these initial criteria, Amber was born. </p>

<h3>Creative tool Whitelines Link digitizes handwriting and sketches</h3>
Swedish innovators Whitelines revolutionized the market for stationery when they in<br/>2006 introduced to the world their paper products built on a simple yet brilliant idea -<br/>white lines against a light grey background.  In september 2012 the team launched yet another innovative product: Whitelines Link, an iPhone application that digitizes the user's handwritten works.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Whitelines Link is a happy combo of physical and digital notes. You could call it a<br/>clever scanner-app that in combination with Whitelines Link paper makes it super easy to capture, save and share your notes.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Whitelines Link for Android</h3>
<div>The application is free and aready available  for iPhone but we want it to be availble for everyone. This is why we need to develop the app for Android.</div>
<div> 
<p><img alt=""Whitelines Link is automagic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://whitelines.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/whitelineslink-flo%CC%88det.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How to use Whitelines Link</h3>
</div>
<div>The basic idea is to let the app and the special Whitelines Link paper actually see each other and the rest will happen automatically.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>make sure the four corner markers of the paper are visible in the display</li>
<li>hold still for a moment</li>
<li>let the app capture your note</li>
<li>save or share your note in whichever way you like</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/48595328"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Start the film, how to capture your note"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://whitelines.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/shortcut.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Makes your handwriting better than in real life</h3>
<div>The app will automatically straighten the paper, clean it from the background and also even-up your handwriting so it will turn out a iittle bit smoother than in  reality.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""Before and after whitelines"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://whitelines.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/F%C3%B6re_efter_2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<h3>A shortcut makes sharing even easier</h3>
<div>A quick way to save or share your work is to tick a Quick Box on the paper with a pen. The app will find your instruction and automatically act on it, either by instantly<br/>creating an e-mail or by sending it to your Dropbox or Evernote account. Inside the app there are other ways of saving or sharing your notes, which also will be stored in the local library.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""Whitelines Link"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://whitelines.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Link_quickboxes.png"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>From inside the app you'll have more sharing options. Publish your doodles straight on Twitter or Facebook within seconds.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> 
<h3><strong>Make it happen!  Make the Whitelines Link go Android</strong></h3>
<p>Our ambition is to get the Whitelines Link for Android on the market by this summer. Your contribution will be crucial for us.  Hopefully you will find  a perk that you think is attractive, but  if your only contribution is to share  the site we will be  cheering that too. In fact, we will be <em>that</em> happy, we will step outside  for each share and  shout  ”thank you”.</p>
<p> If we by chance would surpass our fundinglevel, the means will be dedicated to further development of the free Whitelines Link app. To new platforms, adding more functionality, meet more ideas, adapte it  to new situations, or… you get it, we have the ideas. Just not the cash.</p>

</div></div>","Creative tool Whitelines Link digitizes handwriting and sketches
Swedish innovators Whitelines revolutionized the market for stationery when they in2006 introduced to the world their paper products built on a simple yet brilliant idea -white lines against a light grey background.  In september 2012 the team launched yet another innovative product: Whitelines Link, an iPhone application that digitizes the user's handwritten works.
 
Whitelines Link is a happy combo of physical and digital notes. You could call it aclever scanner-app that in combination with Whitelines Link paper makes it super easy to capture, save and share your notes.
 
Whitelines Link for Android
The application is free and aready available  for iPhone but we want it to be availble for everyone. This is why we need to develop the app for Android.
 



How to use Whitelines Link

The basic idea is to let the app and the special Whitelines Link paper actually see each other and the rest will happen automatically.


make sure the four corner markers of the paper are visible in the display
hold still for a moment
let the app capture your note
save or share your note in whichever way you like



 
Makes your handwriting better than in real life
The app will automatically straighten the paper, clean it from the background and also even-up your handwriting so it will turn out a iittle bit smoother than in  reality.
 

A shortcut makes sharing even easier
A quick way to save or share your work is to tick a Quick Box on the paper with a pen. The app will find your instruction and automatically act on it, either by instantlycreating an e-mail or by sending it to your Dropbox or Evernote account. Inside the app there are other ways of saving or sharing your notes, which also will be stored in the local library.
 

 
From inside the app you'll have more sharing options. Publish your doodles straight on Twitter or Facebook within seconds.
 
 
Make it happen!  Make the Whitelines Link go Android
Our ambition is to get the Whitelines Link for Android on the market by this summer. Your contribution will be crucial for us.  Hopefully you will find  a perk that you think is attractive, but  if your only contribution is to share  the site we will be  cheering that too. In fact, we will be that happy, we will step outside  for each share and  shout  ”thank you”.
 If we by chance would surpass our fundinglevel, the means will be dedicated to further development of the free Whitelines Link app. To new platforms, adding more functionality, meet more ideas, adapte it  to new situations, or… you get it, we have the ideas. Just not the cash.

one-button control. The usually complicated timer tasks are made easy by the
user-friendly interface.





Mum taps the screen of her smartphone to remotely turn off the light,

flowers for you, effectively saving your time and energy.



As
a protection against would-be thieves, the Contros can turn on your lamp randomly by setting
the random timer.


Overcharging smartphones will significantly reduce their battery life. The Contros
automatically stops charging when the battery is full.

Equipped
with a mini night light, the Contros can light your way when you go to bed at
night. This is also featured in the timer setup function. 





You can benifit from powerful functions at a super lower price now! So what are you waiting for?!


Are
you still wasting time setting up your traditional outlet timer? If so, the Contros
is the solution to your problem! With a stable performance, it enables you
to automate and control your home appliances. More importantly, the price is even
cheaper than the traditional outlet timer.

accumulated a huge customer base. As the 4th generation product, the Contros is
a reliable product with stable performance.

information：The “Lock device” function, effectively prevents your devices from being controlled
by other people.
•  Reliability:
Available with US and EU plug types with TUV certification, the Contros is designed with
fire resistant PC material and tested with over 50,000 switches life time.




•Download the free BroadLink “e-Control” App from the Apple App Store/Google Play.

Although there are hundreds of thousands of mobile applications on the market, not one has been created for African-American girls. 3 million African-American girls in the United States hold a buying power of $24 billion, but Internet/mobile technology companies don’t have this valuable demographic on their radar. When you search the term  ""Black Girls” on any search engine the negative imagery and lack of representation the girls face in the media and online is depressing and not a true reflection of this special demographic.    SOCIALgrlz is building an app to fill the void and to give African-American girls (13-17) their own platform to learn and connect together. We are dedicated to improving the quality of life for African-American girls through the development of a mobile, Web and publishing service.  We are the first company of its kind!                                 After years of research and conceptual development, our mobile website has been launched and now we are ready to develop a mobile application for the Android and Apple platforms.  The mobile app will have articles, interviews and our specially designed book called the SOCIALgrlz TXTbook, a collaborative book between girls and experts, as well as a column with pearls of wisdom from seasoned African-American women. The purpose of the column is to provide African-American girls valuable guidance from successful role models and energize inter-generational interaction. Some of the girls may not have relationships with their grandmothers or other seasoned women who can provide much needed guidance and love; we want to help them connect to women they can look up to for advice.                                                SOCIALgrlz provides five interactive channels: Be Heard!; SOCIALgrlz TXTtbook; SOCIALgrlz Bookshelf; SOCIALgrlz Certified and Odessa’s Wisdom. All of these mobile platforms provide African-American girls with opportunities to improve their self-esteem through modern technology by engaging and learning from each other, as well as, gaining wisdom from women who have great insight and life experience.                                  TheSOCIALgrlz Textbook gives African-American girls a chance to use their voices in a way that has never been done.  The SOCIALgrlz TXTbook will cover six specific topics -- Lifestyles, Health & Wellness, Finance, Education, Leadership and Building Relationships. The book is designed to give girls a safe place to speak about topics important to them and receive advice from women who understand their questions about life.  This innovative book will become a valuable tool for girls to help navigate through their social issues, and ultimately a source for experts.  SOCIALgrlz  would respectfully like your support of our crowd-sourced funding campaign to raise $50,000 for the development of our startup mobile application. The cost will cover design, testing and development of a mobile application for Apple and Android platforms.                                                WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE

<p>We have created the right, well researched conditions to use your smart phone camera and hardware for good quality, accurate 3D scanning.</p>

<p><b>What Are the Limits?</b></p>
<p><b>Size</b></p>
<p>True, you cannot scan a bus but it is also impossible to print a bus with a home printer.</p>
<p>Talking seriously: at first we plan to manufacture a one size pouffe with different decor and design. With one size it is possible to optimalise, to define the space needed for the pouffe, its price, and functionality.</p>
<p><b>Accuracy and Colour Rendering</b></p>
<p>It depends on your phone optics.</p>If you are not planning to change your phone soon but wish to maintain the high level of dimensional accuracy and colour rendering, you may be interested in the version with separate optics. In this case costs of the separate optics will be built into the price.<p></p>
<p><b>The Seat of the Team</b></p>
<p>The company’s seat is in Sarasota, Florida.  We plan to supply the US market with our products from there. However, the development and technical support is in Europe. Product assembly is carried out in both places, depending on the place of delivery. We look for solutions to provide an optimal customer supply.</p>
<p><b>Quality Guarantee</b></p>
<p>Product assembly for the US market is carried out in the USA. Also, as our aim is to provide the best quality possible, we constantly test the parts for the final product. We seek out partners, suppliers and assembly shops who can provide the high level of service and high quality material used in manufacturing. The hardware parts are put to strict testing and we look into suggestions that could make the Pouff3D better and more stable.</p>
<p><b>Prototype</b></p>
<p>During the development of the scanner we constantly carry out experiments concerning the hardware and software performance. The current device creates good-quality 3D objects based on cell phone photos. Research have shown that the final quality depends on the accuracy and optical design of the cell phone camera. With the best optical sensor, precision of less than 1mm is possible. Based on experiments with the photos of an iPhone 4, we can say that a precision of 1-2mm is achieved when rendering an object.</p>
<p>The goal of this funding campaign is to build a better prototype.</p>
<p>The first mechanical results are soon to be published. The movement of the cell phone in the prototype is carried out with pre-set parameters. However, our plan is to achieve the control of mechanical movement, using the bluetooth communication channel.</p>
<p>The design has a key role. We believe that when buying a product for the home, it is right to expect an aesthetic experience. We plan to provide a pouffe that is available in different designs, made of different materials. Our aim is to provide a piece of furniture that is not only functional but is a perfect decoration of any home. </p>
<p>To achieve that, we look forward to any feedback on the product apperance.</p>

<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>We came up with the idea of the scanner 4-5 years ago. András started thinking about how 3D scanners could become available to anyone for an affordable price and what ways a 3D scanner could be used. It was not the right time at that point to make such devices, the technology, softwares and hardwares were not at the right level. About 1 year ago we took up on the idea again, seeing how cell phone and hardware manufacturers tried to bring 3D closer to people. We looked into our opportunities and the tools available. We realised that there are devices of very good quality but they are all aimed at indulstrial users and they are all ugly. We wanted to bring this technology into people’s home but not the version in a grey or black metal case with cables hanging out on all sides. This is where design came into the picture. We though of the pouffe to achive all this.</p>
<p>Also, we wanted to break with the working tradition of table 3D scanners that turn around the object and only check the sides of the objects.

Creative approach  
The highest knowledge in image creation  
A developed unique structured light device  
Based on all these, high quality and modelling software development. We have University background for technological development.Why Is the Approach Unique and Creative?

This device will not become outdated
Pouff3D works the same any flatbed scanners: after placing the object inside, the lid is closed. During scanning the object is invisible to us, we do not hold it in our hands.
Our aim is the avoid trembling hands holding a camera or trying to compensate the movement of the object with special optics, and avoid a software using up a lot of memory space or size precision measured in centimeters. These all rise the cost of the dimensionally accurate scanner.

<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Die Nationalsozialisten haben während 1933 und 1945 elf Millionen Menschen ermordet: Juden, Homosexuelle, politische Gegner, Sinti und Roma, sowie Behinderte und andere Menschen, die nicht dem rassistischen Ideal entsprachen.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Stolpersteine wurden ins Leben gerufen, damit keiner der elf Millionen Menschen je vergessen wird.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Stolpersteine sind 10 x 10 x 10 cm große, in Beton gegossene Steine mit einer an der Oberseite verankerten Messingplatte, die dort in den Gehsteigen verlegt werden, wo diese Menschen lebten, bevor sie verschleppt, deportiert und ermordet wurden. Auf den Stolpersteinen sind die Namen der Opfer, sowie Geburts- und Todestag, sowie der Ort der Ermordung eingehämmert.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Inzwischen gibt es über 40'000 Stolpersteine in nahezu 1100 Städten in 16 Ländern Europas.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><strong>Jedoch nicht in München, wo der Nazi-Terror begann und die NSDAP ihre ersten Wurzeln schlug.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">2004 hat der Stadtrat die Verlegung von Stolpersteinen auf öffentlichem Grund im Stadtgebiet verboten. Wenige Stunden nach dieser Entscheidung wurden die 13 zuvor verlegten Stolpersteine durch Angestellte der Stadt hastig aus dem Boden gerissen. Ohne Rücksicht auf die Gefühle der Angehörigen der Opfer, denen es ein tiefes Anliegen war, ihrer Eltern, Goßeltern oder Geschwister einen Ort des Gedenkens zu geben.</span></span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Seit diesem schwarzen Tag kämpft die Initiative ""Stolpersteine für München e.V."" gemeinsam mit Münchner Bürgern gegen den unfaßbaren Stadtratsbeschluss und hat dabei zahlreiche Gemeinderäte im Münchner Umland, sowie vier von fünf Parteien in München auf ihrer Seite.</span></span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: small;"">Zwischenzeitlich wurden 221 Stolpersteine hergestellt und 24 konnten auf privatem Grund nahe des Gehsteiges verlegt werden. 197 Stolpersteine warten auf ihre Verlegung. Über 5000 Opfer des Holocaust warten auf ihr Mahnmal.</span></p>

<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Die von uns entwickelte Smartphone-App funktioniert folgendermaßen:</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Kommt der Benutzer der App am ehemaligen Wohnort eines der Opfer vorbei, wird ihm dies durch einen Ton oder Vibration signalisiert. Die App wird dann - wie ein Stolperstein auch - Namen, Geburts- und Todestag, sowie den Ort, wo der Mensch ermordet wurde, anzeigen. Die App wird diese Daten um eine kurze Biographie, das Schicksal des Einzelnen und seiner Familie, zusammen mit einem Foto - soweit vorhanden - anzeigen.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Eine Übersichtskarte zeigt die Positionen und führen den Benutzer an die entsprechende Stelle. Doch auch von zu Hause oder außerhalb von München können diese digitalen Stolpersteine angeklickt und die Biographien gelesen werden.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Für Touristen, Münchner Bürger, Historiker, Schulklassen und kommende Generationen ist die App ein hervorragendes Werkzeug gegen das Vergessen. Und sie wird ein Mahnmal sein, dass so etwas nie wieder geschehen darf.</span></span></p>

<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3000 EUR benötigen wir für die Programmierung der ersten APP-Version</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">2210 EUR (10 EUR pro Stein) benötigen wir für die Erstellung der ersten 221 Biographien.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Über das Finanzierungsziel hinaus werden wir für jeweils 10 EUR pro Stein ein weiteres Schicksal recherchieren, eine Biographie und redaktionelle Begleittexte erstellen und diese in der APP veröffentlichen. Mit dem Ziel, den über 4000 Opfern des Nationalsozialismus in München ein elektronisches Denkmal zu setzen.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Jeder kann mithelfen, unserem Vorhaben Leben einzuhauchen. Innerhalb der APP wird es in einer späteren Version die Möglichkeit geben, für weitere Dokumentationsseiten zu spenden. </span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"">Jede Spende bedeutet, dass das Gedenken an einen weiteren Menschen am Leben erhalten werden kann.</span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Unser Ziel</strong></span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Mit unserer APP wollen wir das Schicksal der NS-Opfer ins Bewußtsein der Öffentlichkeit rücken, den Opfern ein Gesicht und eine Biographie geben und vor allem junge Menschen, die erfahrungsgemäß zu den engagiertesten Unterstützern der Stolpersteine gehören, weiter für das Thema zu sensibilisieren.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Vielen Münchnern ist das Projekt ""Stolpersteine"" unbekannt, da sie diese noch nie gesehen haben, außer in anderen Städten. Und das möchten wir ändern.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Damit ist die Stolpersteine APP auch eine Form des Widerstands gegen das Verbot durch den Stadtrat, denn digitale Stolpersteine kann man weder verbieten, noch entfernen.</span></span></p>

<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""color: #222222;"">“<span style=""font-size: medium;"">Stolpersteine” is German for “stumbling blocks”, and that is precisely what they are: brass-topped concrete blocks some 10 cm x 10 cm in size that are placed in the sidewalks in front of the buildings where the people they are commemorating lived before being dragged off to their places of death.</span></span></p>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Engraved in the brass plaque is the name, date of birth and place of death or deportation of the individual being commemorated. </span></span></p>

<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Ever since then, ""Stolpersteine für München e.V."" initiative has spearheaded a broad-ranging coalition fighting to get this decision rescinded.

<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Meanwhile, under the initiative’s auspices, more than 230 Stolpersteine have been created.

Stolpersteine in München: Vorgeschichte
Die Nationalsozialisten haben während 1933 und 1945 elf Millionen Menschen ermordet: Juden, Homosexuelle, politische Gegner, Sinti und Roma, sowie Behinderte und andere Menschen, die nicht dem rassistischen Ideal entsprachen.
Stolpersteine wurden ins Leben gerufen, damit keiner der elf Millionen Menschen je vergessen wird.
Stolpersteine sind 10 x 10 x 10 cm große, in Beton gegossene Steine mit einer an der Oberseite verankerten Messingplatte, die dort in den Gehsteigen verlegt werden, wo diese Menschen lebten, bevor sie verschleppt, deportiert und ermordet wurden. Auf den Stolpersteinen sind die Namen der Opfer, sowie Geburts- und Todestag, sowie der Ort der Ermordung eingehämmert.
Inzwischen gibt es über 40'000 Stolpersteine in nahezu 1100 Städten in 16 Ländern Europas.
Jedoch nicht in München, wo der Nazi-Terror begann und die NSDAP ihre ersten Wurzeln schlug.
2004 hat der Stadtrat die Verlegung von Stolpersteinen auf öffentlichem Grund im Stadtgebiet verboten. Wenige Stunden nach dieser Entscheidung wurden die 13 zuvor verlegten Stolpersteine durch Angestellte der Stadt hastig aus dem Boden gerissen. Ohne Rücksicht auf die Gefühle der Angehörigen der Opfer, denen es ein tiefes Anliegen war, ihrer Eltern, Goßeltern oder Geschwister einen Ort des Gedenkens zu geben.
Seit diesem schwarzen Tag kämpft die Initiative ""Stolpersteine für München e.V."" gemeinsam mit Münchner Bürgern gegen den unfaßbaren Stadtratsbeschluss und hat dabei zahlreiche Gemeinderäte im Münchner Umland, sowie vier von fünf Parteien in München auf ihrer Seite.
Zwischenzeitlich wurden 221 Stolpersteine hergestellt und 24 konnten auf privatem Grund nahe des Gehsteiges verlegt werden. 197 Stolpersteine warten auf ihre Verlegung. Über 5000 Opfer des Holocaust warten auf ihr Mahnmal.
Dokumentationsprojekt für Stolpersteine
Mit unserer Dokumentation werden wir noch in diesem Jahr ein digitales Mahnmal für diese Opfer errichten.
Die von uns entwickelte Smartphone-App funktioniert folgendermaßen:
Kommt der Benutzer der App am ehemaligen Wohnort eines der Opfer vorbei, wird ihm dies durch einen Ton oder Vibration signalisiert. Die App wird dann - wie ein Stolperstein auch - Namen, Geburts- und Todestag, sowie den Ort, wo der Mensch ermordet wurde, anzeigen. Die App wird diese Daten um eine kurze Biographie, das Schicksal des Einzelnen und seiner Familie, zusammen mit einem Foto - soweit vorhanden - anzeigen.
Eine Übersichtskarte zeigt die Positionen und führen den Benutzer an die entsprechende Stelle. Doch auch von zu Hause oder außerhalb von München können diese digitalen Stolpersteine angeklickt und die Biographien gelesen werden.
Für Touristen, Münchner Bürger, Historiker, Schulklassen und kommende Generationen ist die App ein hervorragendes Werkzeug gegen das Vergessen. Und sie wird ein Mahnmal sein, dass so etwas nie wieder geschehen darf.
Was wir brauchen
Mit Erreichen unseres Finanzierungsziels können wir die erste Version der APP programmieren, die das Schicksal von 221 Menschen dokumentiert, für die es bereits Stolpersteine gibt, die jedoch bis zur Verlegung eingelagert oder ausgestellt sind.
3000 EUR benötigen wir für die Programmierung der ersten APP-Version
2210 EUR (10 EUR pro Stein) benötigen wir für die Erstellung der ersten 221 Biographien.
Über das Finanzierungsziel hinaus werden wir für jeweils 10 EUR pro Stein ein weiteres Schicksal recherchieren, eine Biographie und redaktionelle Begleittexte erstellen und diese in der APP veröffentlichen. Mit dem Ziel, den über 4000 Opfern des Nationalsozialismus in München ein elektronisches Denkmal zu setzen.
Jeder kann mithelfen, unserem Vorhaben Leben einzuhauchen. Innerhalb der APP wird es in einer späteren Version die Möglichkeit geben, für weitere Dokumentationsseiten zu spenden. 
Jede Spende bedeutet, dass das Gedenken an einen weiteren Menschen am Leben erhalten werden kann.
Unser Ziel
Mit unserer APP wollen wir das Schicksal der NS-Opfer ins Bewußtsein der Öffentlichkeit rücken, den Opfern ein Gesicht und eine Biographie geben und vor allem junge Menschen, die erfahrungsgemäß zu den engagiertesten Unterstützern der Stolpersteine gehören, weiter für das Thema zu sensibilisieren.
Vielen Münchnern ist das Projekt ""Stolpersteine"" unbekannt, da sie diese noch nie gesehen haben, außer in anderen Städten. Und das möchten wir ändern.
Damit ist die Stolpersteine APP auch eine Form des Widerstands gegen das Verbot durch den Stadtrat, denn digitale Stolpersteine kann man weder verbieten, noch entfernen.
Weitere Wege, wie man helfen kann
Erzählen Sie möglichst vielen Freunden und Verwandten von unserem Vorhaben, posten Sie den Link zu unserer Kampagne auf Facebook, Twitter etc.:
http://igg.me/at/stolpersteine
Wenn Sie Journalist sind oder Kontakte zur Presse oder den Medien haben, freuen wir uns natürlich über entsprechende Publicity.
Stolpersteine sind Zeichen des Erinnerns.
Mit Ihrem Beitrag geben Sie der Erinnerung einen Namen, ein Gesicht, eine Biographie.
Helfen Sie uns dabei, die Erinnerung an eine Frau, einen Mann oder ein Kind am Leben zu erhalten.
 
 

ENGLISH
Stolpersteine 
The Nazis murdered during their reign of terror – 1933 – 1945 - 11 million people – Jews, homosexuals, dissidents, Sinti and Roma, and other groups. Stolpersteine have been created to make sure that none of these 11 million individuals is forgotten. 
“Stolpersteine” is German for “stumbling blocks”, and that is precisely what they are: brass-topped concrete blocks some 10 cm x 10 cm in size that are placed in the sidewalks in front of the buildings where the people they are commemorating lived before being dragged off to their places of death.
Engraved in the brass plaque is the name, date of birth and place of death or deportation of the individual being commemorated. 
There are now 40,000 Stolpersteine. They are found in nearly 1100 cities in 16 countries.
But not in Munich, even though it the city was where the Nazi party was founded and gained strength.
Stolpersteine: banned in Munich 
In 2004, Munich’s municipal council banned the placing of Stolpersteine on public property – the city’s sidewalks. A few hours after this hasty and ill-conceived decision, 13 Stolpersteine – installed at the express and heartfelt wish of relatives of the victims – were ripped out of their sidewalks.
Ever since then, ""Stolpersteine für München e.V."" initiative has spearheaded a broad-ranging coalition fighting to get this decision rescinded. A number of borough councils and four of the five major political parties have joined prominent figures from intellectual and business life in calling for a revoking of the decision.
Meanwhile, under the initiative’s auspices, more than 230 Stolpersteine have been created. Twenty-three have been placed on private property adjoining sidewalks, the rest await their installment.
This means that over 5,000 victims of the Shoah are waiting to be commemorated.
Stolpersteine Documentation Project
Our Stolpersteine smartphone app will create a digital memorial for these victims.
The app will work like this. The user of the app will be alerted by it when she or he is approaching the place of final residence of a victim of the Shoah. The app will display the name, picture and short biography of the victim, with this including her or his fate.
The Stolpersteine app will also display a clickable map. It will provide an overview of where present and potential Stolpersteine sites are located in Munich, thus guiding users to them.
This app will thus be a powerful tool for researchers and for schools, which will use it to go on tours commemorating the victims and thus warning against a revival of such persecution.
What we need
As soon as we have reached our financing goal, we can start programming the initial version of our app, which will include the biographies of the some 230 people for whom a Stolperstein has been created.


We will need 3000 EUR for the programming of the first app version, and


2210 EUR (10 EUR per Stolperstein) for the 221 biographies

Anything above that will be used to fund our long-term goal of creating electronic memorials for all of Munich’s victims of the Shoah.
Use our app to donate
You can use our app to donate for
 A person or persons
 A place in which the victims lived prior to being deported.
What your donation does
 It keeps alive the memory of a person who suffered persecution, hardship and death.
 It keeps alive the memory of the Shoah itself, especially for young persons, who are among the most dedicated supporters of Stolpersteine.
 It tells people in Munich – many of whom have never had an opportunity to do such – that there are such things as Stolpersteine. And the electronic Stolpersteine can’t be banned or ripped out of sidewalks.

<p>Our product enables people to share numbers with meaning (numbbies) with each other: information, data, statistics, percentages, etc. in a free, intuitive, modern, easy to use web and mobile app. <br/><br/> There is nothing like Numbby in the market, and we believe we will revolutionize the industry with our product the way Facebook did with pictures, Twitter with text, Wikipedia with content and Pinterest or Instagram with photos, but we will do it with numbers!</p>

<h2>The Scanther Kit</h2>
<p>Customers carrying smartphones willing to connect to your business' web and social media pages are walking out the door of your business in droves, without connecting. Moreover, walking out the door with the customer are your missed opportunities for sales, loyalty, and profit from that customer and all of their social media friends.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Signs directing customers to web and social media pages are, to put it kindly, prehistoric. Take a look around at the impossibly long Facebook URL painted on the wall of the coffee shop, or the giant homemade QR code in the window of the restaurant. More importantly, notice how many businesses have no signs at all to direct customers to their web and social media pages.</p>
<h3>Best time to engage</h3>
<p>The single best time to engage a happy customer on your web and social media pages is when they are at your business.</p>
<p><strong>Now for the kicker</strong> - even if you are able to navigate your way to a business' web page with your smartphone, about 90% of business websites are not mobile ready. You probably already know this from your own experience.</p>
<p>The Scanther Kit solves ALL of these problems. Virtually every business needs at least one Scanther Kit. Simply put, if a business has or needs a website or one of the various types of social media pages, they need a Scanther Kit.</p>
<h3>What is a Scanther Kit?</h3>
<p>Scanther is a retail boxed kit of 5 professionally designed smart signs using NFC, QR, and SMS to drive traffic to your included Instant Mobile Site. (What is NFC, QR, &amp; SMS? - see below). Setup is simple and you can be up and running in as few as 10 minutes. Basically, Scanther is a Smart Sign set, Text messaging campaign, and Mobile Website in a box.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3> <span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What is NFC?</span>
</h3>
<p>NFC is the abbreviation for Near Field Communication. NFC is a short-range wireless connectivity technology that uses enables communication in close proximity. When a customer positions an NFC enabled smartphone near or against the “TAP” logo on your Scanther smart sign, it opens your mobile site. NFC has other uses as well. NFC is emerging technology and is currently being adopted by businesses around the world.</p>

<h3> <span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What is a QR code?</span>
</h3>
<p>QR is the abbreviation for Quick Response. A QR code is a two dimensional matrix barcode into which information can stored. When a customer with a QR reader app on their smartphone scans the QR code on your Scanther smart sign, it opens your mobile site on the web browser of the customer's smartphone. QR codes have other uses as well.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What is a SMS?</span></h3>
<p>SMS is text messaging. When a customer texts from your Scanther Smart Sign, Scanther auto responds with a single text message that contains a link to your Instant Mobile Website. On smartphones with web browsers the link sent by Scanther should appear as a ""hot"" link so that your Instant Mobile Website will be accessed when the customer touches the link.</p>

Customers carrying smartphones willing to connect to your business' web and social media pages are walking out the door of your business in droves, without connecting. Moreover, walking out the door with the customer are your missed opportunities for sales, loyalty, and profit from that customer and all of their social media friends.
Why?
Signs directing customers to web and social media pages are, to put it kindly, prehistoric. Take a look around at the impossibly long Facebook URL painted on the wall of the coffee shop, or the giant homemade QR code in the window of the restaurant. More importantly, notice how many businesses have no signs at all to direct customers to their web and social media pages.
Best time to engage
The single best time to engage a happy customer on your web and social media pages is when they are at your business.
Now for the kicker - even if you are able to navigate your way to a business' web page with your smartphone, about 90% of business websites are not mobile ready. You probably already know this from your own experience.
The Scanther Kit solves ALL of these problems. Virtually every business needs at least one Scanther Kit. Simply put, if a business has or needs a website or one of the various types of social media pages, they need a Scanther Kit.
What is a Scanther Kit?
Scanther is a retail boxed kit of 5 professionally designed smart signs using NFC, QR, and SMS to drive traffic to your included Instant Mobile Site. (What is NFC, QR, & SMS? - see below). Setup is simple and you can be up and running in as few as 10 minutes. Basically, Scanther is a Smart Sign set, Text messaging campaign, and Mobile Website in a box.
 

 What is NFC?

NFC is the abbreviation for Near Field Communication. NFC is a short-range wireless connectivity technology that uses enables communication in close proximity. When a customer positions an NFC enabled smartphone near or against the “TAP” logo on your Scanther smart sign, it opens your mobile site. NFC has other uses as well. NFC is emerging technology and is currently being adopted by businesses around the world.

 What is a QR code?

QR is the abbreviation for Quick Response. A QR code is a two dimensional matrix barcode into which information can stored. When a customer with a QR reader app on their smartphone scans the QR code on your Scanther smart sign, it opens your mobile site on the web browser of the customer's smartphone. QR codes have other uses as well.

What is a SMS?
SMS is text messaging. When a customer texts from your Scanther Smart Sign, Scanther auto responds with a single text message that contains a link to your Instant Mobile Website. On smartphones with web browsers the link sent by Scanther should appear as a ""hot"" link so that your Instant Mobile Website will be accessed when the customer touches the link.

What’s included with the Scanther Mobile Site Builder?
Your mobile site can include the following elements, in the order you want:

Your logo with an optional text description area
Social Media and Web Buttons each with an optional annotation line
Custom Buttons each with an optional annotation line
Photos with optional captions and your Video
Text Area where you can write whatever you want
Your Address, Location Map, Hours, Events, and Contact Information
Email Signup and Comments so you can connect with your customers
Survey Questions you write so you can get direct feedback from your customers

<h2><strong>The SMS Text Home Automation System</strong></h2>
<p>We created the SMS Text Home Automation System to provide homeowners with low-cost, easy-to-install, wireless home monitoring for security, potential disasters, and minor mishaps that become more costly when left unattended.</p>
<p>While most smartphone apps simply monitor homes for security intrusions via camera or video link, this state-of-the-art, FCC-certified technology monitors for burst water pipes, power outages, flooding, and intrusions.  The SMS Text Home Automation System sends text alerts and photos directly from the installed device, eliminating costly central alarm system set-up and monthly service subscription fees. The SMS system is also completely wireless, making installation and maintenance simple and streamlined for any homeowner with a smartphone.</p>
<p>The system is simply designed for consumer convenience. All that is required is a separate Sim card, which is provided by your cell phone carrier.</p>
<h2>Why We Need Your Help </h2>
<p>I've invested a great deal of my time and money into bringing the SMS Text Monitoring System to this point. With your help, we can purchase all of components in volume at price points that will make theSMS Text Monitoring System affordable for everyone. However, I have a lot to do before I can start shipping the SMS Text Monitoring System. By funding this project you are also helping to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finalize the packaging for all the units</li>
<li>Purchase additional test equipment for final quality control</li>
<li>Fund the development of additional devices to function with the control center</li>
</ul>
<p>We have contracted with a manufacturing facility in Hong Kong. The facility has completed other manufacturing projects for us and we have a great deal of confidence in doing an outstanding job with this project!</p>
<h2><strong>About the Team</strong></h2>
<p>Each team member has their own story of experimenting with radio frequency and designs accessible to hobbyists &amp; enthusiasts, and in creating low-cost professional scale projects.</p>
<h3>Michael Reeves, Inve<strong>ntor<br/></strong>
</h3>
<p>I have more than 40 years of experience as a telecommunications engineer and inventor. In addition to this enhanced, text-based home security system, I also invented the highly successful holiday light bulb tester, “The Guiding Light,” which sets of a  strobe light when 911 is dialed from inside a home, and “The Notifier,” which alerts a UPS or Federal Express delivery person if there is a package for pick-up inside a building.</p>
<p>The idea for this project came from my experience living in Florida, where power outages are common and lengthy, and regularly traveling to visit family in my hometown of Kankakee, Illinois. I wanted a home monitoring system that didn't require high monthly alarm company payments, or a centrally monitored, hard-wired communications system.</p>
<h3><strong>Nick Robinson (Engineering student/Michael Reeves' grandson)</strong></h3>
<p>I am an engineering student at Illinois Institute of  Technology  working with software and hardware engineers. Although this is my first project, my team members have been involved with The Edison Inventors group in Florida and together we have developed many electronic projects.</p>
<h2><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></h2>
<p>Due to the nature of the project, we have a professional lab certification for all of the devices we have developed. Therefore, all devices in the project have FCC certification. We also have sought legal advice to ensure that our equipment is in full compliance with American and international regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>As with any other technology project, our delivery dates can be affected by component inventory. We have tried to avoid any surprises during a production run by selecting only parts with viable stock quantities during the design phase of the SMS Text Monitoring System. Additionally, we have been in contact with distributors about their inventory.</p>
<p>A successful production run has been planned from the very beginning of the project. We selected a manufacturer that has experience with prototype and production runs for all boards. In using the same manufacturer all the way through, we are able to correct and avoid issues. At this time, our delivery dates are based on worst case scenario and lead times can always change. I am doing all in my power for earlier delivery and there exists a good chance of this happening.</p>
<p>To further ensure the quality of shipped SMS Text Monitoring System, I have run an extensive quality control and electrical tests to verify each system. The last item is to package everything in a functional and pleasing package. This is to be completed thru independent packaging service which we have used in the past.</p>
<h2><strong>Rewards<br/></strong></h2>
<p>Contributors can order the home alarm system and all related components for a starting price of $65.00, without contracts, subscriptions or long-term commitments. All that is required for activation is a new Sim card and a text messaging subscription plan from your preferred cell phone carrier.</p></span></span></span></span></div>","The SMS Text Home Automation System

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I love everything about the 3D printing revolution and while I know its early days for everyone, I'm absolutely sure it's here to stay. I'm not an expert in designing 3D printers but I am an expert in providing 3D content which I firmly believe is just as important as the machines themselves. </span></p>
<p>Anyone can take a photo but not everyone can take a good photo. Even less people can edit them using specialist software so, in my opinion not everyone is going to be able to model things in 3D. That’s why I want to build MediumWare into the largest library of usable 3D components available.</p>
<p>The plan is to start simple. I've modelled a number of different categories of standard components and created hundreds of thousands of variations. The important thing is that all these parts are designed to work so you can print usable parts for your projects - threads tighten, gears mesh &amp; bearings roll!</p>
<p>I need your help because I really need you to test these parts out on your printers. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Do they print </span>OK?<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> Do they work? What settings did you use? What's your preferred material choice? </span></p>
<p>Your expertise and feedback here is vital to ensure this library of parts maintains the high quality standard that MediumWare set's out to achieve.</p>
<p>When the site goes live to the public, these parts will be downloadable via our web store and, <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">like the Google play or Apple app stores, some will be free and some be paid for. Right now though, because I need your help as Beta testers, I'm offering full access to the entire library for just </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">£5 which is a massive saving.</span></p>
<p><strong>What We Need...</strong></p>
<p>The funding is needed to pay for an assistant to help me incorporate all your feedback into the library. I expect this Beta testing phase will take 3 months and that it will cost approximately £5000 in wages to employ someone for this period.</p>
<p><b><strong>... and What You Get</strong>:</b></p>
<p>As a thank you for your pledge we'll be giving you lifetime access to your selected categories, even when the site goes live. </p>
<p>Remember, all our models are designed to work straight off the 3D printer so you'll have access to a huge and expanding range of working parts for your projects.  </p>
<p>In addition, as a valued member of our Beta testing team, you'll be the first to know about new categories, special offers and the latest MediumWare news.</p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What happens if I don't get all the funds?</b><br/></p>
<p>The project will still go ahead if I don't get all the funding but it will likely take a bit longer to launch the site. What's more important is that I get your help as Beta testers because I really need your feedback to get this just right.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>By helping me to achieve my goal you'll be helping everyone in the maker community who need fast access to useful, high quality parts in order to get their projects up and running. This is just the beginning however as we'll be introducing the following categories over the coming months:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Pipes and fittings</li>
<li>Valves</li>
<li>Clips</li>
<li>Hinges</li>
<li>Fans</li>
<li>Pumps</li>
<li>Gearboxes</li>
<li>Wall fixings</li>
<li>Blanking Plugs</li>
<li>Pastry cutters</li>
<li>Springs</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As MediumWare Beta testers we'll issue you with coupons so when these categories are released you'll get access for a significant discount. If we hit our targets with this campaign I may even be able offer them as stretch goals and incorporate them into the initial launch catalogue. </p>
<p>In the future I plan to use my experience to provide fully parametric models via the site and my ultimate aim is to teach others how to do this and how to generate income by contributing to the MediumWare library. I can't stress enough that your help is vital in getting the foundations in place!!</p>
<p>You should also know that I've done this numerous times before and successfully created large libraries of parts as a consultant for corporate clients, so I'm absolutely sure of my approach and costings.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>If you can't contribute don't worry but if you're excited about the MediumWare project; please, please do your best to get the word out via the Indiegogo tools, Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus.

The final test was great, the material is hard enough and it won't jam when you open / close the case. To give a better protection, We used 3 layers different material:Bicast (PU) Leather in the surface to prevent scratch + Hard plastic in the middle, absorb impact+ Microfibre inner to protect the screenInside we use 2 straps to secure your Apple pencil, Prevent it from scratch and missing

2 stand mode : Landscape and Portrait, for watching movie or reading

What is Webfish?
Webfish is an innovative web application for fast and easy website development. It is a first complex solution for websites creation. Style of work is similar to work in graphic editors. User doesn’t need to write code. Application is based on Drag & Drop interface. The application approaches for developers, designers and even people who doesn’t know coding.
Who needs this application?


Regular users.


Website development must be available for everyone. Now people who don’t know programming can create websites on webfish. And not only simple sites, but also a professional and multifunctional websites.

Developers.

Web developers are tired of writing the same rows of code. We need to optimize a website development process. Our app will let developers an opportunity to make websites faster and easier. Now they can concentrate on innovations creation. Technology must evaluate.
Web designers.

Now designers will be able to create websites by themselves.Designer can create a website and send link with his design in live html. So never will be difference between design and a final website. 





Why we did this?
We work in web development sphere for four years. During this time we’ve realized that web design evaluates, appear new technologies, but development methods not changing. Developer build websites in the same way like it was fifteen years ago. Same hand coding. So we decided to create an application that will combine all necessary tools for developers and designers.

Timeline
We’ve worked on our application for a year. And we created  innovative platform for website development. Now Webfish can create websites based on Joomla CMS or Html or create templates for Joomla. Websites built on our application is  an automatically responsive. Website fits himself to any screen resolution. Still we need to improve our application and add more tools.



Where the money goes?

We need your help to finalize our application development and open it to a wide audience.We are very excited about this project and hope you are too. We appreciate your support and please share Webfish with your friends too!The amount of funding we require to achieve our main goals is $150,000. We hope you will find it in your heart to help us deliver this innovative and useful technology.

the Westwood Robotics (also known as 221 Robotics) team has grown exponentially
from just 3 members to more than 20 committed members today. Through hard work
