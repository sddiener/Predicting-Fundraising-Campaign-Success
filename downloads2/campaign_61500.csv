<h3>Hi! I'm Nick!</h3>
<p>I'm a storyteller - always have been. From the time I sprayed my little brother with the hose at one of our kiddy pool outings and told my mom it was sweat [1991] to documenting a tale of youthful wanderlust along the Pacific coastline [2011], I've been obsessed with captivating others with stories. </p>
<p>For the last four years, I've been capturing my surroundings and those that inspire me - camera always in hand. My heart beats for soft, natural light, pure and raw energy, and a connection with both my subject and audience. <span>What inspires me most about living a creative life is that I can wake up in the morning and grab a camera or pencil or Super Twin Tip Permanent Sharpie Marker™, and make something that didn’t exist yesterday.</span></p>
<h3>The Mission</h3>
<p>This October, a team of medical professionals and I will travel to Haiti to partake in a medical relief trip - one that several of the team members make every year. I have been asked to contribute both medically and creatively, assisting where needed in the pharmacy and registration while providing a body of photographic work documenting the many admirable people who contribute their time to provide efficient medical care to those in need. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Skinny</h3>
<p>The funds generated from this campaign will be used to provide transportation from the Cheshire Medical Center in Keene, NH to Logan International Airport in Boston, MA to Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. It will also supply the team and myself with medical translators, food, lodging, transportation while in Haiti, and other necessary amenities. Extra funds will cover camera equipment rentals and data storage. And scrubs. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While I personally have no medical background, I will work to help ensure the team sees close to 250 people a day. We often hear mainstream media report the devastation and hardships that third world countries undergo but I think it's important to understand that there are people who are helping and contributing. My goal is take my love for storytelling and photography and share these stories of selflessness. Integrating photography, travel, and a helping hand, this project is exactly the kind of work I hope to continue creating throughout my career. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>No money? No problem!</h3>
<p>I understand not everyone has the funds to contribute so sharing this project on your social avenues means just as much to me! Post this Indiegogo campain page to your Facebook and Twitter feeds, talk about it over dinner with your friends, or mention the project to your dog while on your morning run. No donation is too small and no effort goes unrecognized.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your love and support. Cyber high-five! And a hug when I see you next!</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hi!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Ich bin Max. Meine große Liebe ist das Reisen mit dem Fahrrad. Jede Fahrt ist ein neues Abenteuer und für mich eine besonders schöne Art Länder, Orte und Menschen kennen zulernen. Während meiner ersten größeren Fahrradtour nach Den Haag habe ich festgestellt, dass brennende Oberschenkel, Schokomüsliriegel und schlechter Schlaf auf harten Isomatten ein unbeschreibliches Freiheitsgefühl bedeuten können. So folgten zahlreiche Touren, wie zum Beispiel eine Fahrt von Chemnitz nach Zagreb oder die legendäre Heckmair-Transalp. Ich bin stets auf der Suche nach neuen Radreise-Herausforderungen und damit bei dieser Idee gelandet:</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Ich werde mit einem Fixie von 8bar (ja, mit einem Gang!) durch 19 Länder Europas Fahren. Für die ca. 10.000km habe ich 4 Monate eingeplant.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mit der Tour möchte ich mich selbst auf die Probe stellen und die landschaftliche und kulturelle Vielfältigkeit Europas kennen lernen.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1299848/files/20150316140256-Route.jpg?1426539776"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Zusätzlich will ich mit meinem Blog ein Zeichen für die Gleichberechtigung von Fahrradfahrern im Straßenverkehr und die Fahrradkultur setzen. Ich werde versuchen unterwegs an so vielen Critical Mass Veranstaltungen wie möglich teilzunehmen, denn regelmäßige Treffen gibt in jeder größeren Stadt Europas.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Critical Mass ist eine kreative Form des Straßenprotests, bei der sich mehrere Fahrradfahrer scheinbar völlig zufällig treffen, um gemeinsam durch Innenstädte zu fahren und nach dem Motto <b>„Wir blockieren nicht den Verkehr, wir sind der Verkehr!“</b> auf ihre Gleichberechtigung gegenüber dem motorisierten Verkehr aufmerksam zu machen.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Die gesamte Tour wird mit Bildern, Videos und Reiseberichten festgehalten, die regelmäßig auf meinem Blog erscheinen werden.</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Start der Tour ist Anfang April 2015.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Wie du mir helfen kannst</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Wenn dir mein Projekt gefällt, kannst du mich jederzeit unterstützen. Gib mir ein Bier aus, schick mir ein virtuelles High-Five indem du meinen Blog verbreitest oder hilf mir die Kosten zu decken und spende so viel du willst.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Jeder eingenommene Euro wird für notwendige Ausgaben während Tour genutzt. Der Großteil der Einnahmen wird für Verpflegung und Verschleißteile am Fahrrad genutzt. Weiterhin werde ich beispielsweise bei der Überquerung nach England oder zwischen Finnland und Schweden Fähren benutzen, für die ich Tickets benötige. Ich werde zwar versuchen, so oft wie es geht zu zelten oder Couchsurfing zu nutzen, trotzdem lässt sich ein Aufenthalt im Hostel manchmal nicht vermeiden. </span></p> <p><b>Die Perks</b></p>

</div></div>","Hi!

Ich bin Max. Meine große Liebe ist das Reisen mit dem Fahrrad. Jede Fahrt ist ein neues Abenteuer und für mich eine besonders schöne Art Länder, Orte und Menschen kennen zulernen. Während meiner ersten größeren Fahrradtour nach Den Haag habe ich festgestellt, dass brennende Oberschenkel, Schokomüsliriegel und schlechter Schlaf auf harten Isomatten ein unbeschreibliches Freiheitsgefühl bedeuten können. So folgten zahlreiche Touren, wie zum Beispiel eine Fahrt von Chemnitz nach Zagreb oder die legendäre Heckmair-Transalp. Ich bin stets auf der Suche nach neuen Radreise-Herausforderungen und damit bei dieser Idee gelandet:
Ich werde mit einem Fixie von 8bar (ja, mit einem Gang!) durch 19 Länder Europas Fahren. Für die ca. 10.000km habe ich 4 Monate eingeplant.
Mit der Tour möchte ich mich selbst auf die Probe stellen und die landschaftliche und kulturelle Vielfältigkeit Europas kennen lernen.


Zusätzlich will ich mit meinem Blog ein Zeichen für die Gleichberechtigung von Fahrradfahrern im Straßenverkehr und die Fahrradkultur setzen. Ich werde versuchen unterwegs an so vielen Critical Mass Veranstaltungen wie möglich teilzunehmen, denn regelmäßige Treffen gibt in jeder größeren Stadt Europas.
Critical Mass ist eine kreative Form des Straßenprotests, bei der sich mehrere Fahrradfahrer scheinbar völlig zufällig treffen, um gemeinsam durch Innenstädte zu fahren und nach dem Motto „Wir blockieren nicht den Verkehr, wir sind der Verkehr!“ auf ihre Gleichberechtigung gegenüber dem motorisierten Verkehr aufmerksam zu machen.
Die gesamte Tour wird mit Bildern, Videos und Reiseberichten festgehalten, die regelmäßig auf meinem Blog erscheinen werden.
Start der Tour ist Anfang April 2015.
Wie du mir helfen kannst
Wenn dir mein Projekt gefällt, kannst du mich jederzeit unterstützen. Gib mir ein Bier aus, schick mir ein virtuelles High-Five indem du meinen Blog verbreitest oder hilf mir die Kosten zu decken und spende so viel du willst.
Jeder eingenommene Euro wird für notwendige Ausgaben während Tour genutzt. Der Großteil der Einnahmen wird für Verpflegung und Verschleißteile am Fahrrad genutzt. Weiterhin werde ich beispielsweise bei der Überquerung nach England oder zwischen Finnland und Schweden Fähren benutzen, für die ich Tickets benötige. Ich werde zwar versuchen, so oft wie es geht zu zelten oder Couchsurfing zu nutzen, trotzdem lässt sich ein Aufenthalt im Hostel manchmal nicht vermeiden.  Die Perks

<h3> In short </h3>
<p>We've been working to make bataua palm fruit harvests sustainable for many years now. But our team has only just begun working with the fruit oil. Our plan was for someone else to create markets for the oil, while we worked on the harvest side. We got tired of waiting. The harvesters got tired of waiting. Together we decided to make and sell products that use sustainably-harvested bataua fruit oil. Even on a small scale. It's the only way to get things moving.</p>
<p>Others have taken a different approach. They use a little bit of the oil - maybe even just a tiny bit - and they put their energies into mass-marketed products. That's fine, so long as the fruit harvests do not involved cutting the whole tree down. Unfortunately, most bataua fruit still comes from destructive harvests of decades-old trees. </p>
<p>We need you to join us, to use the oil, use the soaps, to feel their benefits, and to grow the sustainable bataua fruit market together.</p>
<p>When they are harvesting bataua fruit for sale, our partners, who live in rain forests, can increase their incomes by 2-4x. Bataua palms are common where they haven't been cut down and so the supply of oil is plentiful. This is not a niche product. It is potentially on par with global olive oil production. Our longer-term goal is to move past exchanging gear for fruit to outright fruit purchases. We want to provide the climbing tools that harvesters use to bring their fruit to market safely and efficiently. There is an enormous potential to do good <i>and</i> do well with bataua fruit oil products. </p>
<h3>The deal</h3>
<p>We need to sell all of the soap and oil that we have, to reinvest the proceeds in palm climbing gear. We've chosen to run a flexible campaign because - while we put plenty of pressure on ourselves to build the project - there is no failure point below which we would be unable to fulfill the perks we are offering. </p>
<p>Clearly these are premium prices for premium products that have a direct impact improving the lives of fruit harvesters in the Amazon. If we did the accounting on the time and effort that have gone into being able to offer you our bataua oil and soaps - well, we'd rather not think about that.</p>
<p>When we meet our campaign goal, we will be able to deliver 75 sets of gear to harvesters.</p>
<p><strong>The Perks</strong></p>
<p><b>""TOLU"" </b>We found this song after a few hours of poking around online. Our kids danced to it, and that was it. We paid a guy from Bratislava named Duhan for the rights to use it in this campaign and he extended the track for us.</p>
<p><strong>Fleischman's Handmade</strong>  Great soap made in the San Francisco Bay Area. Bataua oil replaces ""palm oil"" in this version of their tried and true formula, Sticking with the other ingredients ensures a hard soap that produces a lather. Offered with Rosemary-lavender and unscented. </p>
<p><strong>Bataua Oil Soap</strong> As basic as it gets. You've used 100% olive oil soap? We used bataua oil, instead, so it is extremely simple. This is a creamy-textured soap, light on lather. We may tweak the recipe after the first month but this soap does what we ask of it: it cleans your skin and it delivers bataua oil.</p>
<p><strong>Straight Bataua Oil</strong> The oil is heavy at 60, 70, 80 degrees. Warm it up and it begins to move. A hair stylist who has used it reported that a very small amount went a long way with heat. Creates a lustrous look without the silicone found in many hair oils. It absorbs very well into the skin, for example on the arms and hands.</p>
<h3>Summing up</h3>
<p>The risks here are pretty minimal. Most of the soap has been made already. The oil has been filtered and is sitting in Berkeley. It's not as though we are proposing to do something we haven't tried, quite the opposite. </p>
<p>By buying in, you can be 1000% sure that the premium price you'll pay for these exceptional products will reach all the way back to the rain forests and the people who live there. </p>

Mike injured the C4, 5 and 6 vertebrae in his neck.  After two
surgeries to stabilize his neck, he had a respirator put in to assist with
his breathing, then also had an additional surgery to set a broken
thumb. There were issues of fluid building in his
lungs, but he has been breathing much better today. The severity
overall of these injuries means that Mike will have to work
hard to regain movement in his arms and legs. His positive
spirit and drive to move on to therapy has us all inspired.  If anyone can
overcome this, it is Mike!</p>

We do not know what
the continued medical costs and rehabilitation expense will be for Mike, but we
all thank you for your support!<br/><br/>*****UPDATE 10/10/13*****<br/>Mike has had some challenges in his healing. Mike is currently fighting pneumonia, which means he is still on the respirator. Mike's lungs seem to be finally clearing so we are hopeful he gets over the pneumonia quickly.<br/>The great news is that Mike has been able to do physical therapy and now has some movement in his right arm and wrist.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Mason. When I was 12 years old i was diagnosed with brain cancer, luckily the tumor was removed, but it left me with cerebellar ataxia of my right side. Cerebellar ataxia is a lack of muscle coordination which may affect speech, eye movements, the ability to swallow, walking, picking up objects and other voluntary movements. Everyday seems harder than the last and I have tried many medications and treatment including botox over the last 12 years, and I an at the point where stem cell treatment is the only resort left. It will be preformed by Doctor Mark Youseff in California.  It costs 20k that my insurance doesn't cover at all, that is why I'm reaching out for help. </p>
<p>My hand shakes almost all the time, so every task that I do has to be approached in a very different way. take cooking for example, I have sliced my hand many many time with a knife trying to cut vegetables, the most resent is slicing me half of the tip of my thumb. Because of my hand shaking constantly I have also suffered many burns from trying to reach for pots and pans. My right leg also has a lack of coordination. I'm constantly running into tables and chairs and even walls. I can hardly walk in a straight line down the side walk or talk with someone walking next to me without running in to the. I also lose my balance a lot, sometimes while standing still.<br/><br/>This treatment will repair the hole left in my cerebellum by my tumor, allowing me to do what most take for granted. It is expensive but I believe investing in yourself is the best investment you will ever make. it will not only improve your life, it will improve the lives of all those around you. <br/></p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my Humla Medical Service Trip fundraising
page!  </p>
<p>I feel very honored to have been asked to join a group of
medical practitioners, led by a Tibetan Bon Buddhist lama, on a 2-week trip to Humla,
a remote area of Nepal, to photographically document their efforts to bring free
medical care to this very poor community. 
Most of the residents of Humla will, otherwise, never see a doctor in
their lives.</p>
<p>When I first started my career as a photographer, back in 1989,
one of the countries I visited was Nepal. 
I spent about a month hiking in the Himalayas, meeting and learning
about the Tibetan people living there, and their culture, and I was so touched
by their generosity, and gratitude for what little they had.  I cannot fully express how right it feels to
me to go back, and give back, to a people who opened my eyes to beauty and
compassion and a spiritual way of life, in a way that I had never experienced
before.</p>
<p>This trip is the first in a venture which hopes to eventually
bring education, as well as continuing medical care, to this region, and in
that vein, documenting it is a vital element in building the project, and
growing that seed.</p>
<p>Each volunteer – be that a medical practitioner, or an
organizer, or photographer – is responsible for their personal costs of the
trip, totaling about $5000:</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Flight
to Kathmandu: about <b>$1600</b></p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Ground
and air transportation once in Nepal, food, lodging, Nepalese staff for camping
and trekking, and a translator and guide: <b>$3400</b></p>
<p>I will also have the expense of additional photography equipment
that is necessary when working in an area without regular and dependable
access to electricity, such as additional memory cards and batteries, and the
renting of an extra camera in case of malfunctions.  This will cost an additional <b>$1000</b>.</p>
<p>I have made a commitment to participating, and providing my services, and all funds
raised will go towards this trip, regardless of whether I meet my goal or not.  (The stated goal on this site is $4000, rather than $6000, as the fees for the site are lower if you meet your goal!)</p>
<p>Of course, the lack of electricity in this area will pose a
particular challenge, and I am working hard to trouble-shoot any potential
problems prior to embarking on the trip. 
I have the experience of traveling and photographing in remote areas, as
well as working in commercial photography, both of which entail constant
technical trouble shooting, so it is something I am accustomed to.</p>
<p>My work in recent years has been focused on portraits and
children, and is fairly journalistic in nature. (If you are interested, please feel free to take a look at <a href=""http://deborahdonenfeld.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my website</a>.) I am thrilled to continue this
work in Humla, with the children and other community members of these villages,
and hopefully touch others with pictures portraying the humanity and
wisdom of a people who so moved me over 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Please contribute if you can, and if that is not possible for
you, but you are excited by the possibilities and potential of the Humla
Medical Service Trip, please forward this on to anyone else who you think will
be touched by it, and might be able to contribute, or forward it on,

News: American Thyroid Association Makes Case for Universal Thyroid Screening in Pregnancy View


Your Thyroid Gland
It's essential to your health because it controls how your body uses oxygen and regulates your metabolism. It’s a butterfly-shaped organ in your neck that controls the oxygen level of all the cells in your body.



The ‘Back of the Classroom’ Troublemaker
Misunderstood and generally misdiagnosed, the thyroid gland is often the culprit of chronic symptoms such as fatigue, weight change, loss of memory, difficulty concentrating, dry skin and nails, hair loss, sensitivity to cold, and depression. This includes issues with your sex life, problems with conceiving, pregnancy problems, postpartum health issues, and the health of the baby. 
 

Recognize these symptoms? What can you do?

Test It. Score It. Fix It.

Get Your Thyroid Tested Without Leaving Home

Know Your ThyroScore

The first step in thyroid care is to test the amount of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) in your blood, also known as your ThyroScore. Too much TSH is called hypothyroidism. Too little TSH is hyperthyroidism. Both conditions are tiresome ways of living, and they can be easily corrected with treatment by your doctor.

Using the newly developed ThyroScore Health Kit you will self-administer a simple and fast at-home blood test and send the results, along with a brief questionnaire, to our CLIA certified laboratory for analysis.

Patented Blood Collection Card



What We're Doing With the Funds We Raise
Besides processing your thyroid test, we are financing FDA testing to gain approval of a new, hand-held medical device that will enable medical professionals to obtain your TSH results in 15 minutes.  This advanced microscopy device uses one drop of blood on an existing, immunoassay test under LED illumination to determine your results simply and accurately.  Developed by Holomic, LLC, a spinoff from UCLA’s Engineering School, the HDR-200 will make thyroid testing a routine and inexpensive procedure. 



The Technology - Place a drop of blood on our ThyroTest® card and insert it into the Holomic HRDR-200. The test card is then imaged under LED-based illumination in a special optical interface. Captured raw images are digitally processed through a smartphone application to reveal test results immediately.



FDA Submission - We're not able to use this technology in today's health fair, though we’ve starting trials already. With your pledges and support, we can pursue an FDA (510)k submission and make thyroid testing fast, easy, and affordable for everyone.  (View Video or View Press Release)

Universal Thyroid Testing
While many have recommended that all pregnant women have their thyroids tested, we believe that thyroid testing should become as routine as having one’s temperature and blood pressure taken as part of any medical intake procedure.  We want people to know their ThyroScore (i.e. TSH Level) as matter-of-factly as they know their blood pressure, for it is an excellent measure of one’s health.
If you're a health conscious person, but you've never measured your thyroid health, then we invite you to find out if you're among the 15 million Americans living with unnecessary fatigue, depression, weight changes, or other symptoms of an unhealthy thyroid. 
Get ThyroScore today and help us make thyroid testing fast, easy, and affordable for everyone:
Thanks to everyone for their support in launching the program so far – we couldn’t have done it without you!

Sincerely,
Sharon CunninghamTom McLellanBruce Rodin

<p>Hello to everyone, my name is Kandace Bellofatto and I would like to introduce you to the Casey Bellofatto fundraiser that I have started in honor of my little sister Casey. Casey is the beloved daughter to Chris and Katrina Bellofatto and an amazing sister to not only me but her two younger brothers. This fundraiser has been created to raise awareness and money in order for Casey to receive the highest quality of medical attention and support systems needed during these very difficult times to recovery.</p>
<p>Casey was involved in a very serious automobile accident that occurred on January 11, 2013 in Carroll County MD. Casey has endured substantial injuries as a result of her accident and is currently being treated at the Bay View Medical Hospital. I will continue to provide available information to this website to ensure correct updates on Casey and her long journey to recovery. What is most important now is providing Casey with the finest available Doctors, equipment, medicine and most importantly support. It has become our entire families mission to not let our much-loved sister to three and daughter leave us without a fight. We truly appreciate any contribution toward helping support Casey in this very important time of need.</p>
<p>We have set a goal of $100,000.000 that we would like to achieve by May 18, 2013 (?) All of the proceeds raised will go directly toward Casey’s treatment, medical and recovery needs. This is just the beginning of what will be no doubt the most difficult journey for Casey and our Family. We are so blessed to have Casey in our lives and to share her with each and every one of you. Please help Casey continue to make an impact on all of our lives. I can already tell you how greatly touched Casey would be just knowing the love and support that those around her are sharing on her behalf. Without a shadow of a doubt, I know we will reach our goal of $100,000.000 and together we can make this happen.  </p>
<p>This fundraiser is not only to raise money toward Casey and her recovery but to raise awareness for a young girl who has so much more to offer now and in her future. The power of information and social networks these days is unbelievable. We are asking that you tell others about Casey and the relationship you have built with her and how each and every donation can go a long way.  We truly appreciate each and every donation made to Casey Bellofatto’s fundraiser.</p>
<p>At a young 18 years of age, Casey has already developed several relationships and strong friendships with so many. I know Casey will pull through these tough times because under all that beauty is a fighter, and since we are positive she will be fighting to stay with us, we are going to continue to go to battle for her. Casey is a bright, bubbly outgoing person who is always ready to take on any challenge placed before her. This may be her greatest challenge yet, and we will be there every step of the way.</p>
<p>Casey has future aspirations to continue with school and become a cosmetologist, which I could never argue with because of her natural talent to do incredible makeup and hair with a great sense of style. We want to guarantee that Casey be able to continue in her dreams in the future. Casey has always said she would like to make an impact on this world we call home and now is your chance to first hand impact that dream of hers. By dedicating your support for this very important and special fundraiser, you will provide Casey with the best medical attention available. Each day that goes by we are so very thankful to still have Casey with us. The internal fight that we all have to keep her by our sides and ensure the future she so rightfully deserves will continue to be our mission. Please join us while we continue to give Casey a full life of happiness. We ask you to be loud and proud while using this fundraiser as a battleground to keep fighting for her life. We once again thank you for all of the support and strength you have given our family. Much love and thanks for all the prayers and support, Thank you! &lt;3</p>

<h3>The Short Story</h3>
<p>The village of El Tamarindo is a 400-family community about thirty minutes south of Leon, Nicaragua. The community is plagued by urinary tract infections, which eventually lead to kidney disease and kidney failure. These diseases are caused by the <strong>parasites contaminating their rivers and the water</strong> <strong>delivered to their village</strong> via truck. Their only other source is a well that was dug over 10 years ago, but the water from it is too salty and too heavy to drink. <strong>These are their only sources of affordable water; none of them are clean</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://help-international.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HELP International</a> Team Nicaragua is trying to fix this solution, and help give <strong>the people of El Tamarindo access to a basic human right: clean water</strong>. </p>
<h3>Who is El Tamarindo?</h3>
<p>Located about half an hour south of Leon, Nicaragua, the community's main industry is salt mining. Everyone who has a job in the village is involved in salt somehow - mining, packaging, or shipping. The 400 families who live in El Tamarindo suffer from the <strong>lack of a basic human need: clean water</strong>. These are their options: </p>
<ul>
<li>Use the water from a 10-year-old well, that is too salty and thick for consumption. </li>
<li>Use the water from the truck that comes that is contaminated with parasites and bacteria. </li>
<li>Use the water from the river, which is also infected with parasites, pollution, and fecal matter from the village upstream. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parents are unable to provide their children with any source of clean drinking water</strong>. The water truck is supposed to come once a week, but often it won't arrive for weeks at a time. Most people have to turn to the river as their only source of water. </p>
<p>The river is often used as a place to bathe, wash clothes, go to the bathroom, and play. But the contaminants in the water means that the villagers often get itchy skin after bathing, washing, or playing in the water. The contaminants in the water are also linked to diahrea, dehydration, a fungus that grows on their skin, urinary tract infections, and kidney disease. </p>
<p><strong>None of their sources of water provide a safe alternative to diharea and disease.</strong> </p>
<h3>What is the Project?</h3>
<p>HELP Nicaragua is working with a local organization, <a href=""http://www.mpoweringpeople.org/uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mpowering People</a>, to help provide clean water to the 400 families in this community. In and attempt to alleviate these dire circumstances, we are <strong>raising $1600  to provide <a href=""http://www.heartforthenations.net/heart_ceramic_water_filters_ecofilter.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ceramic filters</a> for</strong> <strong>60 families and the school</strong>. These filters are made in Managua, Nicaragua, and are made out of clay, sawdust, and colloidal silver. They are 99% effective for filtering out contaminants in the water. </p>
<p>Due to our limited resources, we are targeting families with younger, school-aged children because they are <strong>particularly suspectible to the parasites in the water</strong>, causing diahrea, which is one of the leading causes of death among this age group of children.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In conjunction with the water filters, we are also holding <strong>health workshops</strong>, to teach the community methods of water purification such as boiling, or bleaching their water before consumption, to kill the parasites. With your donations, we will be able to give 60 families, including 300 children access to clean water. </p>
<p><strong>This is our plan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have created a survey that will help us distinguish the families with the <strong>greatest need for the filters</strong>, the population with the greatest suspectibility to water-related illness. </li>
<li>We will distribute the survey to the families of Tamarindo and, with the help of our partners at Mpowering People, and select the 60 families that demonstrate <strong>the most need and willingness</strong> to contribute time and resource to the water sanitation campaign.</li>
<li>Recipients will sign a contract, stating that they will care of the filters, as well as <strong>pay a $70 cordoba buy-in</strong> for the filters (about US $3) that will go towards a fund the benefits all the recipients. </li>
<li>In addition, they are required to attend and bring 2 other participants to the <strong>water sanitation workshops</strong> for the community.</li>
<li>The fund will be mainatined by Mpowering People, and distributed by the committee of community members to those who apply for a US $12 for buying <strong>a replacement filter</strong> in case it breaks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We are targeting families: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>with children younger than 5 years old</li>
<li>with multiple children in the school system</li>
<li>with a monthly income of less than $2500 cordoba (about US$107 a month) </li>
<li>and that are willing to support through attendence and bringing 2 other community members to the water sanitation workshops. </li>
</ul>
<p>We are <strong>working with the</strong> <strong>local nurse</strong> to develop the curriculum about the importance of hydration, and ways to sanitize their water sources through bleaching and boiling, in order to kill the parasites causing illness.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How Can You Help?</h3>
<p><strong>No parent should have to live facing the almost certainty that their child will suffer some type of water borne illness</strong>; whether it be boughts sickness and diahrea, threatening their livelihood, or whether they may be one of the 'lucky ones' whose fight is postponed until age and prolonged exposure to these parasites and infections has caught up with them, and begins claiming their kidney function. </p>
<p><strong>A 30 liter filter for $24.85 and can give an entire family the luxury we enjoy everyday: clean drinking water - free of parasites and other harmful contaminates. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Less than $30.00 can help relieve concern, and make a child's future that much brighter. </strong></p>
<p>This what you can do to help:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$1</strong> can <strong>promote awareness</strong> of this problem, and help correct a basic human necessity. </li>
<li>
<strong>$12</strong> can provide <strong>a replacement filter</strong> that can be used for up to 5 years, in case one of the filters break. </li>
<li>
<strong>$25</strong> can provide <strong>a filter for a 5-person family</strong>, giving the gift of clean water to children who would otherwise be at risk for kidney disease, urinary tract infections, and other water-related diseases. </li>
<li>
<strong>$50</strong> can provide <strong>two filters for the 150 children</strong> of the primary school of El Tamarindo. </li>
<li>
<strong>$100</strong> can provide <strong>four filters for the 300 children</strong> of the primary and secondary schools in El Tamarindo. </li>
</ul>
<p> Your support will make a difference!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What More Can You Do?</h3>
<p>Money is not the only moving force in this universe. The transfer of knowledge is equally, if not more, important. Please help us raise awareness, so that we can reach anyone that might be interested in blessing a family in need, by: </p>

Their only other source is a well that was dug over 10 years ago, but the water from it is too salty and too heavy to drink. These are their only sources of affordable water; none of them are clean.
The HELP International Team Nicaragua is trying to fix this solution, and help give the people of El Tamarindo access to a basic human right: clean water. 
Who is El Tamarindo?
Located about half an hour south of Leon, Nicaragua, the community's main industry is salt mining. Everyone who has a job in the village is involved in salt somehow - mining, packaging, or shipping. The 400 families who live in El Tamarindo suffer from the lack of a basic human need: clean water. These are their options: 

Use the water from a 10-year-old well, that is too salty and thick for consumption. 
Use the water from the truck that comes that is contaminated with parasites and bacteria. 
Use the water from the river, which is also infected with parasites, pollution, and fecal matter from the village upstream. 

Parents are unable to provide their children with any source of clean drinking water. The water truck is supposed to come once a week, but often it won't arrive for weeks at a time. Most people have to turn to the river as their only source of water. 
The river is often used as a place to bathe, wash clothes, go to the bathroom, and play. But the contaminants in the water means that the villagers often get itchy skin after bathing, washing, or playing in the water. The contaminants in the water are also linked to diahrea, dehydration, a fungus that grows on their skin, urinary tract infections, and kidney disease. 
None of their sources of water provide a safe alternative to diharea and disease. 
What is the Project?
HELP Nicaragua is working with a local organization, Mpowering People, to help provide clean water to the 400 families in this community. In and attempt to alleviate these dire circumstances, we are raising $1600  to provide ceramic filters for 60 families and the school. These filters are made in Managua, Nicaragua, and are made out of clay, sawdust, and colloidal silver. They are 99% effective for filtering out contaminants in the water. 
Due to our limited resources, we are targeting families with younger, school-aged children because they are particularly suspectible to the parasites in the water, causing diahrea, which is one of the leading causes of death among this age group of children.


In conjunction with the water filters, we are also holding health workshops, to teach the community methods of water purification such as boiling, or bleaching their water before consumption, to kill the parasites. With your donations, we will be able to give 60 families, including 300 children access to clean water. 
This is our plan:

We have created a survey that will help us distinguish the families with the greatest need for the filters, the population with the greatest suspectibility to water-related illness. 
We will distribute the survey to the families of Tamarindo and, with the help of our partners at Mpowering People, and select the 60 families that demonstrate the most need and willingness to contribute time and resource to the water sanitation campaign.
Recipients will sign a contract, stating that they will care of the filters, as well as pay a $70 cordoba buy-in for the filters (about US $3) that will go towards a fund the benefits all the recipients. 
In addition, they are required to attend and bring 2 other participants to the water sanitation workshops for the community.
The fund will be mainatined by Mpowering People, and distributed by the committee of community members to those who apply for a US $12 for buying a replacement filter in case it breaks.

We are targeting families: 

with children younger than 5 years old
with multiple children in the school system
with a monthly income of less than $2500 cordoba (about US$107 a month) 
and that are willing to support through attendence and bringing 2 other community members to the water sanitation workshops. 

We are working with the local nurse to develop the curriculum about the importance of hydration, and ways to sanitize their water sources through bleaching and boiling, in order to kill the parasites causing illness.


How Can You Help?
No parent should have to live facing the almost certainty that their child will suffer some type of water borne illness; whether it be boughts sickness and diahrea, threatening their livelihood, or whether they may be one of the 'lucky ones' whose fight is postponed until age and prolonged exposure to these parasites and infections has caught up with them, and begins claiming their kidney function. 
A 30 liter filter for $24.85 and can give an entire family the luxury we enjoy everyday: clean drinking water - free of parasites and other harmful contaminates. 
Less than $30.00 can help relieve concern, and make a child's future that much brighter. 
This what you can do to help:


$1 can promote awareness of this problem, and help correct a basic human necessity. 

$12 can provide a replacement filter that can be used for up to 5 years, in case one of the filters break. 

$25 can provide a filter for a 5-person family, giving the gift of clean water to children who would otherwise be at risk for kidney disease, urinary tract infections, and other water-related diseases. 

$50 can provide two filters for the 150 children of the primary school of El Tamarindo. 

$100 can provide four filters for the 300 children of the primary and secondary schools in El Tamarindo. 

 Your support will make a difference!

<h3>Our mission</h3>
<p>Our mission is to bring natural, healthy and free contraception to every woman in the world and help the couples with efficient family-planning.</p>

<h3>Get your money back + earn much more</h3>
<p><b>OPTION 1 - more money</b></p>
<p>All our perks are based on giving our contributors various service vouchers in much bigger value than the contribution itself. As all vouchers are code-based, you can sell all them e.g. on eBay and get your money back.</p>
<p><i>E.g. You have time - one-year premium membership has a value of $100, you contribute $5, get 2 vouchers. As this is membership, you can sell it on eBay at least for $30, so you will get at least $60 for your $5 contribution. </i></p>
<p><b>OPTION 2 - faster money</b></p>
<p>After the project started to generate money, we will establish ""investor money pool"", where all positive balance money will be (income - costs = balance). If you use your voucher here, you will get back your contribution + 100% + 4% inflation. </p>
<p><i>E.g. You want money eartly - you contributed $1000, use your voucher in investor money pool and you will get $2040.</i></p>
<p>The lowest perks are limited as it is not possible to reward multiple account for one person. </p>
<p>Investor money pool will be limited to the positive balance at certain time, so e.g. if there will be $1000 in pool and you want $2000, you can will post request, the $1000 will be blocked and if another $1000 will come, you will get paid.</p>
<p>Of course some values as campaigns are base on the amount of users in system, we suppose using the voucher, after one year from start (1M users, every marketing channel has 100K users). If we have less users, the value of campaigns will be lower, otherwise it will be higher. </p>
<p><b>The more money we get to start, the faster will be possible to have high value vouchers.</b></p>

<h3>Revolution in contraception begins</h3>
<p>After several years of studying researches, gathering the data and testing, we got it. We are going to remove old myths and will give the possibility of natural contraception to every women free of charge including free add-on services, all this is possible thanks to high technology of today.</p>
<p><b>Why do not use other contraceptions?</b></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Condom</b><br/>-not comfortable, not permitted by some religions, failure can be up to 18% (Trussell, 2007), expensive regular use</li>
<li>
<b>Hormonal</b><br/>-increases risk of breast cancer even with only period of use (Marchbanks, Polly A., et al. 2002) and cervical cancer (Pike, M. C., and D. V. Spicer, 2000; ) especially in later ages of the woman (Kahlenborn, Chris, et al, 2006), changing the natural woman's cycle, also individually may lead to change of moods, body mass and other symptoms, there are long period to get pregnant after using</li>
<li>
<b>Cervical cap, diaphragm and other internal barrier methods</b><br/>- not comfortable even for women, sensitive to right manipulation, increases risk of infection</li>
<li>
<b>Chemical<br/></b>- pure chemical content, discomfortable - woman cannot use the soap before and after the usage for some hours, it has limited time period protection, some sexual behavior is not possible</li>
</ol>
<p><b>How often is contraception really needed - theory of woman's fertility</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Human egg can accept sperm in only about a 24 hours period</li>
<li>Sperms can survive in womens' reproductive tract for up to 3 days (some sources say 5 days)</li>
</ul>
<p>So in general, if a woman has 25 days to have a sexual intercourse (excluding 5 days of menstruation from 30 day cycle), only 6 days are really possible of getting pregnant. So the needs of contraception are only 6 days of 25.</p>

<p>So the only one problem is to predict the ovulation exactly and have some extra days before and after.</p>
<p><b>Myth busting</b></p>
<p>With modern technology, you can predict ovulation from / up to</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">temperature - 99,3%</span></li>

</li>
<li>optically from spit - 98%</li>
</ul>
<p>The more methods you use, the more exact result you get.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Elecronic contraception how to</h3>
<p>Temperature prediction is the most exact method, but the devices for the prediction on the market are very expensive (we have one for 600 USD) and the results are limited to the device (no computer connection, no firmware update).</p>
<p><b>So our goal is to create complex platform, which will work this way:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Woman measure her temperature by<br/>a) USB / Bluetooth connected thermometer to her smartphone with auto-save<br/>b) standard thermometer and manually save the result to<br/>---- typing to the website<br/>---- typing to smartphone application<br/>---- sending the SMS (standard, not paid)</li>
<li>After period analysis (2-3 cycles) she has the possibility to know when it is safe to have a sexual intercourse, where it is recommended to abstain or use barrier / chemical contraception and when it is a high risk of getting pregnant. All this information is available:<br/>a) on the website<br/>b) on the smartphone application<br/>c) via SMS (on request or regularly e.g. ""send me an SMS, where the fertile period starts)</li>
<li>OPTIONAL - She can use other two methods of predictions additionally to have more exact results - the system will inform her, when to start using LH hormone test and / or optical microscope.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>This will lead to a healthy life with natural sexual intercourse.</b></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Get pregnant whenever you want</h3>
<p>Of course if a woman knows the fertile days, she can be successfully pregnant much faster than without it.</p>

<p><i>What is 1-phase/3-phase? Can you tell how to detect if I have 1 phase or 3 phase?</i></p>
<p>This is basically how your home is connected to electricity provider. Sometimes you have 1-phase network (typically 2 wires coming into your home), sometimes (if you have big house or a lot of appliances) you may have 3-phase, in this case you'll have more that 2 wires. </p>
</div><div><p style=""display: inline !important;"">You can look at your fuse box or circuit breaker to determine that. If a label there says 3-Phase (for example, ""3-Phase 120/208V"" or ""3-Phase 240/415V""), then you order a 3-phase Ecoisme sensor. Otherwise order a 1-phase sensor. If you are not sure about your connection type - you can take a picture of your meter and send it to us.</p></div><div> <p><i>Can Ecoisme sensor determine which light is turned on, if I have many “exact same” bulbs (LED, CFL, etc) ?</i></p>
<p>Yes, if devices are exactly the same and not ""smart"", Ecoisme sensor will show number of them and total power consumption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Is there some setup required that allows for each device to be turned on and off in order to record the specific power pattern and tie it to a device?</i></p>
<p>Initially you have to turn on/off your device and system will remember it. Next time when device will work, we'll combine information about change in power consumption and noise in electric network with fingerprints of your devices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Will I need to pay some subscription fee?</i></p>
<p>Especially for our Indiegogo contributors we do not plan to charge any service fees lifetime, you do not have to worry about this at all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>I live in the U.S. and I have 1-phase network with two cables, 120 V each. Will a 1-phase sensor work for me?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, it is possible to use 1-phase Ecoisme sensor for this purpose. We will release a special U.S. version of Ecoisme sensor that will work in electricity networks of this type.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>How can I install Ecoisme sensor?</i></p>

<p> </p>
<p><i>How long are cable with the sensor? Can I extend them?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clamp will have around 1m cable, but since it is a regular 3-wire cable with a 3.5mm stereo jack, you will be able to extend it if needed.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Also it will be possible to connect the sensor directly to the fuse box by an electrician.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><i>Will there be local access, or Ecoisme sensor requires all-time connection to the cloud?</i></p>
<p>Ecoisme sensor requires all-time connection to the cloud because we have algorithms which does not currently seem to be possible to run on client-side alone (though, part of computations will be on client-side).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>What is the difference between Ecoisme sensor and solutions that are already exist on market?</i></p>
<p>Our technology is based on two factors: power and spectrum analysis. We have much more precise algorithms that can detect even devices with power consumption which varies like TVs, laptops, phone chargers, that other solutions just cannot do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Any plans to integrate with services like IFTTT?</i></p>

</div><div><p> </p></div></div>","Our Indiegogo campaign has ended but you can still pre-order Ecoisme at https://ecoisme.com Meet EcoismeThe World's Most Intelligent Home Energy Monitoring System      Ecoisme is a single device for your home that brings a new level of comfort to your life! Thanks to the technology behind Ecoisme, you can now track energy consumption for your devices, get clear recommendations on how to reduce energy usage and receive alerts when devices are left turned on.  With Ecoisme you don't need to worry if you forget to switch off the iron or AC, if your kids left the lights on in the middle of the night, or if the refrigerator door has been left open. Ecoisme will help you to take care of this. We have created a solution that is extremely easy to use and perfect in all aspects of design, usability and accuracy. One sensor is all it takes to make your home truly smart.   Press coverage
 
 

 
Know your homeBe aware of how much energy is used by your home appliances. Track energy usage for your AC, heater, kettle, oven, TV, phone charger, laptop, etc., on one simple dashboard. Find out which appliances are energy-efficient or not and receive precise tips on how to improve and reduce your energy usage.With Ecoisme it is possible to save up to 15% of electricity every month! Get critical alerts Ecoisme incorporates your home appliances. If you forget to switch off the iron, AC, hair straightener or stove, Ecoisme will immediately remind you. It will even remind you if you forgot to close the refrigerator door or if you leave a window open in the hot summer days.  Improve your kids’ safety With Ecoisme you will know when your kids come home and what devices they are using. By checking the enabled devices on your Ecoisme profile, you can observe if the microwave oven, TV or Xbox® was turned on. You can receive a quick and simple read on how much time has been spent on each device to make sure they are within the limits you have set for them. If you have a babysitter watching over your kids, you will know exactly which  activities are being done with your children and for how long. For example, you will be able to see if your babysitter is watching TV instead of actively playing with your children.   Integrate with other solutions Do you have NEST®, WeMo® or other smart devices at your home? Ecoisme will integrate with them, making your home significantly smarter. Smart devices within your home can be synced with Ecoisme, reducing the time spent managing each device separately and making it easy to multi-task. Easy tasks such as powering on the coffee machine when you wake up, turning off your air conditioner when you leave home and programming your stereo system turn on at a certain time can be easily managed with Ecoisme.   Integrate with solar panels If you have solar panels, you will be able to easily integrate them with Ecoisme and get a new level of visualisation - clear, intelligent and user-friendly. Ecoisme will show you, for example, that half of coffee was made by solar energy or you reduced your expenses on water heating on 30% because of solar panels. Moreover, Ecoisme will suggest you how to use solar energy in the best way. For example, it will notify you that if you wash clothes now, you will do it free of charge, using energy only from solar panels.   Why Ecoisme?  SimpleWe designed Ecoisme with simplicity in mind. Setting up your Ecoisme sensor is safe and easy, and takes less than 10 minutes. Just put a clamp on your main power line and insert the plug into the power socket. Afterwards you can view details from your home appliances, receive personalized tips on how to lower your electricity bill and view important alerts, all through the Ecoisme web or mobile app.  Teachable You can easily teach Ecoisme to recognize your devices. Although Ecoisme will be able to recognize most of your devices automatically, you can teach it to learn a new device instantly. In order to do this, just follow two easy steps: 
Click add new device
Switch it on/off a few times.
   Accessible from everywhere Ecoisme can be accessed through the web or mobile app from anywhere in the world. It supports iOS and Android. Moreover, the Ecoisme app can track your location. And if you have left your home, it will notify you to return to disable household devices, left turned on.  And very powerful Ecoisme uses complex technology, combining spectrum analysis and power analysis.We use power analysis to detect simple devices such as the kettle or iron. These devices have specific fingerprints in power usage and time which allows us to detect each unique device. To recognize devices with switched-mode power supplies such as a TV, laptop, or phone charger, we use spectrum analysis. These devices produce unique noise in electric network. We can even detect different brands of devices by using this advanced technology.  The clamp sensor is used to measure the current. The connection of a plug to the socket is used to measure voltage and will also power the sensor.  Technical Specs

 Our road to Indiegogo We spent almost 2 years, developing Ecoisme. During our development process we created 4 sensor prototypes, beginning with simplest form, the Arduino-based which was completely inaccurate and measured only power, to now our latest sensor which is small, measures both power and spectrum and sends all the data via WiFi.   We created a number of design concepts and finally settled on a look that was discrete and one that could blend in with any setting.  
 

 We performed a lot of tests before finalizing the sensor. With that being said, we would like to thank the 30 participants whom all agreed to let us install sensors in their apartments so we could collect data and improve our algorithms. The data collected for each device also helped us program the sensor to recognize multiple household appliances.  Our timeline  Our team We are a group of dedicated geeks who share a passion for energy, technology and design. We have developed many successful and useful projects including the web-portal for Ukrainian revolution Opir.org (more than 800 000 views in first 24 hours). Our team has several years of experience in hardware. We have worked with the army to develop a software for detecting the direction of shoot and two of our team members are founders of Kyiv Hackerspace. Our team was inducted into the New Europe 100 list of innovators, the Top-10 Smart Energy projects in Europe and we secured 1st place in the RWE Utility Day on CeBIT in Hannover.

<span>The
Brian Reams Foundation was created in memory of Brian Reams, a member of our
fraternity that was killed in 2007 by a drunk driver when he was walking a girl
home from the bar. It was always Brian’s dream that when he graduated college
he would open up a recreation center for underprivileged youth in his hometown
of Pocatello, ID. Since Brian’s father opened the Brian Reams Memorial fund, we
have really taken it upon ourselves as Brian’s brothers to raise awareness and
funds in order to keep Brian’s dream alive. We have raised thousands of dollars
over the years for this foundation and we would love to keep the tradition

Brian Reams Foundation was created in memory of Brian Reams, a member of our
fraternity that was killed in 2007 by a drunk driver when he was walking a girl
home from the bar. It was always Brian’s dream that when he graduated college
he would open up a recreation center for underprivileged youth in his hometown
of Pocatello, ID. Since Brian’s father opened the Brian Reams Memorial fund, we
have really taken it upon ourselves as Brian’s brothers to raise awareness and
funds in order to keep Brian’s dream alive. We have raised thousands of dollars
over the years for this foundation and we would love to keep the tradition
going. We encourage everyone to take a little time out of their day and donate to
this great cause! We have also provided a link to an article that was written shortly after the accident which should give some insight on the kind of man Brian was and what happened the night of his death. Thank you!http://dailyemerald.com/2007/11/27/in-the-momen...",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I live in Goleta CA, with my beloved partner of 24 years, Kathryn Lubahn and my Godson, Vittorio Grieco.<br/><br/>I am a former military officer of the Royal Australian Engineers. For over two decades, I suffered PTSD. I experienced nightmares every night, emotional swings, isolation, hopelessness, and a difficulty being a part of society. My loving family suffered as well, yet stood by me. I am so grateful to them I devoted my life to creating an ""antidote"" to PTSD. <br/><br/>Inspired by the military dog-tag, I combined my background in engineering, metaphysics and art, to create a ChiTag™.<br/><br/><p>                      <br/></p>Remarkably, in the process of making my ChiTag™ problems I had given up on ever healing, suddenly changed. My nightmares stopped cold. I am much calmer and I am not hitting pockets of despair, I am much more optimistic, I am enjoying people again, I am able to focus on my family, friends and business with so much more fulfillment, and my family feels victorious because they've stood by me all this time.

I live in Goleta CA, with my beloved partner of 24 years, Kathryn Lubahn and my Godson, Vittorio Grieco.I am a former military officer of the Royal Australian Engineers. For over two decades, I suffered PTSD. I experienced nightmares every night, emotional swings, isolation, hopelessness, and a difficulty being a part of society. My loving family suffered as well, yet stood by me. I am so grateful to them I devoted my life to creating an ""antidote"" to PTSD. Inspired by the military dog-tag, I combined my background in engineering, metaphysics and art, to create a ChiTag™.                      Remarkably, in the process of making my ChiTag™ problems I had given up on ever healing, suddenly changed. My nightmares stopped cold. I am much calmer and I am not hitting pockets of despair, I am much more optimistic, I am enjoying people again, I am able to focus on my family, friends and business with so much more fulfillment, and my family feels victorious because they've stood by me all this time. They have always believed in me. We are increasingly happy.I am so inspired by this I want to give these to veterans with PTSD for free and I am asking you to help me fulfill my dream by contributing to my campaign.Did You Know?According to PTSD foundation, five active duty soldiers attempt suicide each day.   •   In the past year alone the number of diagnosed cases of PTSD in the military jumped 50% – and that’s just diagnosed cases.   •   Studies estimate that 1 in every 5 military personnel returning from Iraq and Afghanistan has PTSD.   •   20% of the soldiers who’ve been deployed in the past 6 years have PTSD.

We managed to raise a third of the goal... we still have a long way to go, though, to reach the amount needed for this surgery. I've created a part two in hopes that we can raise the rest of the funds before my surgery on June 25th.</p>
<p>I'm 27 years old and have struggled for the last 4 years with various health issues following a stressful accident at work that landed me in the hospital briefly. A large part of the struggle has been faulty sinuses... my doctor has recently taken an MRI of my head and discovered that my sinuses don't drain properly because the tubes are extremely small. Much smaller than they should be! This has made an impact on my health in many ways including:</p>
<p>*headaches that sometimes become migraines</p>
<p>*vision problems</p>
<p>*hearing problems</p>
<p>*tinnitus</p>
<p>*dizziness</p>
<p>*trouble concentrating/sleeping</p>

<p>*chronically stuffy nose</p>
<p>*weakened immune system</p>
<p>*low energy</p>
<p>*panic/anxiety issues</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I need to have endoscopic sinus surgery done so that my sinuses will drain. I've gotten progressively sicker over the last 3 years and over this last winter, I had two sinus infections and was sick for about 4-5 months straight. The doctor has already had me on several rounds of heavy antibiotics. Summer usually is better for me, and the doctor has determined that I NEED the surgery done by the end of summer or I could end up back on antibiotics or even in the hospital in winter. WE HAVE SCHEDULED THE SURGERY FOR JUNE 25th.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this point, I have applied for all of the financial help I can, but because I don't have insurance and because this surgery is considered 'elective', I can't get financial help. This is the most discounted price the hospital could offer me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before all of these health issues, I was a hard working go-getter with a huge personality and a lot of energy to spare. People even said they wished they had half the ambition and energy I had! I've lost my energy and a lot of my confidence. While this surgery won't fix some of the other health issues I struggle with, it will certainly help a large handful of them and help me to get back to writing books, building up my friends, sharing energy with others, interviewing people you love, making jewelry and trying to create a more glittery world.</p>

<p>Two years ago, our CEO, Jaume Palou, was preparing his holidays. His children suggested going to Thailand and trekking through the jungle to see wild animals, especially elephants. The whole family was really excited about the idea.<br/> </p>
<p>Jaume suffers from sleep apnea so he asked the travel agent if he might  plug his CPAP machine in during the flight and also while in the jungle. The answer was an emphatic “no.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At first, Jaume could not resist the idea of not being able to travel. Would he carry his  batteries on him? By calculating the power necessary to keep the CPAP working during six nights in the jungle, he concluded that he would need to carry on his back 55 lbs of car batteries. Something impossible at all.</p>
<p>So, finally, he and his family had to cancel their trip.</p>
<p>However, as an Electronic Engineer, Jaume couldn’t stay inactive. He had to come up with a solution. It was necessary to develop a new CPAP device: portable and autonomous. That’s how Airmony was born.</p>
<p>We have developed the new Airmony CPAP: a hoseless, portable and with Bluetooth connection device. It  can be plugged into a standard USB Power Bank. Now, we are proud to announce that we have the first working prototype.</p>
<p>We now need the funds to carry on with the industrialization of the project together with all the regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Airmony is a disrupting CPAP experience which will allow Sleep Apnea patients to get a feeling of freedom and control, improving their life quality.</p>
<p>The Indiegogo perks have been designed to allow contributors to receive an extra value and discount on the Airmony retail price, as long as being updated and collaborate in the final design and industrialization.</p>

<p>WHAT IS SLEEP APNEA?</p>
<p>Sleep apnea is a respiratory disorder in which breathing is interrupted for more than 10 seconds during sleep. These pauses in respiration may reoccur between 5-30 times per hour.</p>
<p>Apnea should be treated, as it can affect the daily life, and cause serious health problems (including high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes or accidents at work or while driving).</p>
<p>The most common treatment for sleep apnea is to use a CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machine, which keeps the user’s airways open while they sleep.</p>

<p><strong>WHY ARE WE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT?</strong></p>
<p>Sleep apnea is a condition that affects many people, particularly adults, but children too. The most common form of treatment is the use of CPAP machines. However, the way these machines are currently designed has a huge impact on the user's quality of life. Today’s machines are large, heavy and bulky and they restrict the users’ independence and autonomy. As a consequence, many people abandon their treatment and stop using the CPAP machine.</p>
<p>Airmony is an innovative CPAP machine that is small, light, comfortable and silent. It does not use an air-hose, it offers a high level of autonomy with low energy consumption, in addition to eHealth technology, which together aim to overcome the disadvantages of traditional CPAP machines. We are currently improving its design (for example, we have reduced the size of the machine by 30%), but there is still a way to go before it is perfect. For this reason, with your support we will be able to continue developing Airmony, to turn it into the breath of fresh air that many sleep apnoea sufferers all over the world have been dreaming of.</p>

<p><br/>Modern clinical grade biofeedback hardware is expensive and complex to use, so we teamed up with Assembly, a top electrical engineering firm, to design the iom2, creating a whole new type of biofeedback platform.</p>
<p>The iom2 is a high fidelity, low cost biofeedback device that connects to the body by ear clip, capturing real-time data on the body’s physiological state. It’s sleek, easy to use and has been designed to allow for additional biofeedback measures to be easily added in the future.</p>
<div data-id=""16951655""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1498591730/syvfwiarvilrd3miocpr.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<p><br/>The iom2 primarily measures Heart Rate Variability (HRV). HRV is a measure of the variation in time between heartbeats and is considered to be a strong indicator of your meditative state. It has been shown through decades of research that a higher HRV correlates with an optimal, relaxed nervous system state, positive emotions, and improved health.</p>
<p>Unyte teaches specific breathing, mindfulness and relaxation techniques that are proven to increase your HRV. With Unyte, you gain instantaneous awareness of your nervous system state and learn to directly influence your HRV. Biofeedback may, as part of a healthy lifestyle, help in the following ways:</p>
<div data-id=""16950808""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://unyte.com/indigogo/image7.gif"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p><br/>Unyte displays real-time feedback with an in-game interface that shows a breathing indicator that guides you to a more optimum breathing rate. Your breathing rate influences your HRV and resonance score, which is clearly displayed in real-time. Our user interface is consistent across every meditation experience. </p>
<p>Unyte’s resonance score ranges from 1 to 100% and is a direct reflection of the magnitude of your HRV. The higher your HRV, and the more relaxed you are, the higher your resulting resonance score. As your score improves, the game progresses via clear visual and audio prompts that show your body is responding.</p>
<div data-id=""16950809""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://unyte.com/indigogo/image8.gif"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<p><br/>Jason Tafler, founder &amp; CEO of Unyte, has been interested in health and the body’s natural healing processes for as long as he can remember. He always knew he wanted to make a difference in the field of health and wellness. What he didn’t know was the path life would take him to get there.</p>
<p>Last year, Jason was rushed to hospital with a serious health condition. In the thick of being treated for life-threatening internal bleeding, he realized the only thing he cared about was living to see his wife and son again.</p>
<p>At the time, Jason was the Chief Digital Officer of Rogers Communications, a $30B Canadian telecom company. He had also run an ad tech company in the US called PointRoll that scaled to over $100M in revenue.</p>
<p>But this focus on achievement and work—putting in 70 to 80 hours of work a week for two decades—had taken a toll. He knew he had to make a lifestyle change.</p>
<p>From his hospital bed, Jason began to meditate daily. He credits many factors to his recovery, but he feels daily meditation was an incredibly important element of his healing process. He decided he wanted to share what he had learned, so he founded Unyte and acquired meditation technology from a company called Wild Divine to bring his vision to life.</p>

<p><br/>Meditation is both a personal and shared experience, and we firmly believe in the value of community and collaboration. We’re including Unyte on Indiegogo because we’re excited for our backers to share feedback and ideas, grow with us, and join us on our journey to health and happiness through meditation.</p>
<p>The funds raised will be used for: 1) hardware - to complete tooling, to fund a pilot production run and quality testing, and for our first manufacturing run; and 2) software - to complete development of our games (including virtual reality development), reporting dashboard, and platform.</p>

</div></div>","*** UPDATE: Our campaign has ended. Please visit us at unyte.com to order***Study after study has shown that meditation is one of the best methods for dealing with the rigors and challenges caused by our chaotic, distracted world.A wide variety of different meditation forms and techniques have been practiced for centuries, and meditation has acquired many different meanings over the years.We believe that all methods of meditation can be beneficial. However, many people do find traditional methods hard to learn and challenging to maintain.Our mission is to help people live happier, healthier lives by making meditation easier to master.Interactive meditation is a relaxation program that uses breathing techniques, immersive experiences and real-time feedback to help you gain more awareness of your thoughts, feelings, emotions and physical state.Regular practice with Unyte can ultimately lead to a calmer and more focused mind and body, which, as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help reduce the risk of or help living well with certain health conditions.By combining biofeedback technology with immersive digital & VR experiences, we make meditation easier to learn, fun and measurable. Think of interactive meditation as a “vacation for your mind”.Unyte is based on technology that we acquired from a company called Wild Divine, which sold tens of thousands of biofeedback devices in 60 countries over the past decade.
Step 1:  Connect the iom2 biofeedback sensor to your ear - this will monitor your Heart Rate Variability and transmit it to your phone, tablet or computer in real-time

Step 2:  Next, select from 50 interactive experiences

Step 3:  Follow the guide and breathing indicator


Step 4:  Watch as your body’s feedback causes your resonance score to increase and the game to progress, teaching you how to meditate more effectively 

Optional:  If you happen to have a VR headset, prepare to be transported to a fully immersive world

 

Modern clinical grade biofeedback hardware is expensive and complex to use, so we teamed up with Assembly, a top electrical engineering firm, to design the iom2, creating a whole new type of biofeedback platform.
The iom2 is a high fidelity, low cost biofeedback device that connects to the body by ear clip, capturing real-time data on the body’s physiological state. It’s sleek, easy to use and has been designed to allow for additional biofeedback measures to be easily added in the future.



The iom2 primarily measures Heart Rate Variability (HRV). HRV is a measure of the variation in time between heartbeats and is considered to be a strong indicator of your meditative state. It has been shown through decades of research that a higher HRV correlates with an optimal, relaxed nervous system state, positive emotions, and improved health.
Unyte teaches specific breathing, mindfulness and relaxation techniques that are proven to increase your HRV. With Unyte, you gain instantaneous awareness of your nervous system state and learn to directly influence your HRV. Biofeedback may, as part of a healthy lifestyle, help in the following ways:

Unyte displays real-time feedback with an in-game interface that shows a breathing indicator that guides you to a more optimum breathing rate. Your breathing rate influences your HRV and resonance score, which is clearly displayed in real-time. Our user interface is consistent across every meditation experience. 
Unyte’s resonance score ranges from 1 to 100% and is a direct reflection of the magnitude of your HRV. The higher your HRV, and the more relaxed you are, the higher your resulting resonance score. As your score improves, the game progresses via clear visual and audio prompts that show your body is responding.

We are also developing a cloud-based dashboard where you can track your overall Unyte usage, scores and progress over time and across all of our interactive experiences. 

 

We have assembled a team of expert technologists and game designers to create over 50 “vacations for your mind” - fully-immersive, meditative experiences.


To keep things interesting, we’ve also formed partnerships with developers who are integrating our biofeedback hardware into their existing games. 
But we wanted to take the next step in offering a truly immersive experience. The result is five original virtual reality games that are designed to optimize meditation, playable with any popular VR headset or in non-VR mode.
The following interactive meditation programs will be included with the Kickstarter edition interactive content bundle:

Engage in five games that take you through an immersive journey based on the classical elements of the universe. This program is VR enabled but also works without a VR headset.

The iom2 is designed to be extensible, allowing for the easy addition of additional biological measurements in the future. While the iom2 is capable of measuring Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) as well as HRV, it will initially ship with an HRV sensor only. 


GSR measures changes in the electrical resistance of the skin caused by emotional stress. The iom2 will use this data to give extra insight into a user’s physiological state and ability to handle and recover from stress. 
GSR sensors and reporting will be available as an add-on to the iom2 in a near-term product update.

At the time, Jason was the Chief Digital Officer of Rogers Communications, a $30B Canadian telecom company. He had also run an ad tech company in the US called PointRoll that scaled to over $100M in revenue.
But this focus on achievement and work—putting in 70 to 80 hours of work a week for two decades—had taken a toll. He knew he had to make a lifestyle change.
From his hospital bed, Jason began to meditate daily. He credits many factors to his recovery, but he feels daily meditation was an incredibly important element of his healing process. He decided he wanted to share what he had learned, so he founded Unyte and acquired meditation technology from a company called Wild Divine to bring his vision to life.

Meditation is both a personal and shared experience, and we firmly believe in the value of community and collaboration. We’re including Unyte on Indiegogo because we’re excited for our backers to share feedback and ideas, grow with us, and join us on our journey to health and happiness through meditation.
The funds raised will be used for: 1) hardware - to complete tooling, to fund a pilot production run and quality testing, and for our first manufacturing run; and 2) software - to complete development of our games (including virtual reality development), reporting dashboard, and platform.
 




Our name says it all. We are passionate professionals united by the goal of helping people through meditation. Together, the Unyte team brings over 70 years of combined experience in starting, building and scaling technology businesses globally. 

 

To develop the best products possible, we’re working with top minds in the engineering and mental health worlds. 

  
 

When our team decided we wanted to create the iom2, we saw a world of possibilities.

 

Then came the tricky part, implementing our vision through technical solutions until we got it right.

 

 

Thank you very much to all of our friends, families, customers, partners and supporters for joining us on this exciting journey. Special shout outs to all of the guides and experts who are featured in many of our interactive experiences.

This impacts the entire neurological and physiological systems.</p><p>As the tones pass through the pads, the patented modulation pattern for each tone creates a unique oscillation in the crystal, generating a correspondingly unique frequency that can be felt deep inside the body.

We have a very close relationship with our manufacturing partners, have spent weeks on the ground working on every detail of the shoe, and we also have a team supervising every detail related to production. We understand and acknowledge that no project comes without risk and challenges. Despite our planning, there are circumstances that may be out of our control. If we are met with these, we promise to communicate with full transparency to you.

We are bringing purchased and donated medical supplies, construction materials, art supplies, and our expertise and labor to each place. We still need to raise more funds for our supplies and for travel expenses. Your support is important to us, because we are completely self-funded! </span></p>
<p class=""p3"">Our flights will depart from Philadelphia on August 9th. Deb returns on August 21st with the team, and I return on August 31st after further solo explorations of the region. </p>
<p class=""p3""> </p>
<p class=""p4""><strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p class=""p4"">I, Ruth, have lived abroad and have traveled in the Middle East, North Africa, Central America, and Europe. I have worked closely with international students and have had work roles supporting people going out on medical missions. I am a working professional now but find ways to consistently be involved in community work. Deb has a passion for the community and has worked extensively in our immediate communities in Camden and in West Chester, and has in the past traveled to Honduras to volunteer her time and labor. She wishes to be involved in medical missions in the future, and this would be her first trip using her medical skills. Our dad nearly devoted his life to working as a doctor in Senegal when I was a baby, and his passion seems to have rubbed off on us :)</p>
<p class=""p4"">All 12 of us are members of Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia. All of us have done volunteer work before, are involved in our communities now, and see it as something we want to be involved in for the rest of our lives. Some of us have been to these specific towns in Colombia before and have already built connections with the children and staff there. Our team will be working with two churches in the area, both of which are deeply involved in their communities and both of which are led by the brothers of our Colombian friend Enrique, who, with his wife, devoted his life to working in the Philadelphia community. Our leader on this trip, Bruce, is from South America. All of our leaders are natives to the area, so understand the needs there and the challenges we will face. Please see the links at the end of this petition to explore the websites of the Colombia missions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""p4""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p class=""p4"">Deb and I have to raise $1,800 each, for our flight, travel expenses, medical supplies, and construction supplies. We have both raised $900 each. We need your help to raise the additional funds. Any additional funds we will raise will go to buying more supplies and to help the community.</p>
<p class=""p4"">We will be making a blog, which we will update with journals and photos whenever we have a chance. You will receive a link to this blog with any monetary donation. We will also be bringing back copies of thank-you drawings from our young friends at the children's home, and we plan to send postcards and buy small gifts for our bigger supporters. Anyone who gives $20 or more will receive a mention on our blog (this will include your name and/or a link to your organization). We want you, our supporters, to feel a personal connection to the mission which you are supporting.</p>
<p class=""p3""> </p>
<p class=""p4""><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">Our trip will have a significant impact on the communities we are serving, especially since a team goes down there every year and we now have direct connections to the communities and therefore a knowledge of what they really need. We will be supplying much-needed medical care to a few different communities. Our main work will be in an orphanage in Santa Marta. We will be bringing our medical clinic to them and will be supplying them with materials and labor to build, amongst other things, their first bathroom. The peoples of Colombia rarely have access to any medicine whatsoever, mainly because of poverty, so our team's yearly visits a valuable asset to the community. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a Family Medicine resident at the Univerisity of Cincinnati/The Christ Hospital. My residency program has a special focus in global health and they allow us to participate in global health each year. For the past 2 Aprils I have been to rural Honduras to work at our clinic there. It was a great opportunity to learn how to care for patients in country with limited resources. This February, I have the opportunity to go to Haiti to work with at a hospital in La Valle de Jacmel named Hospital St. Joseph. They have a partnership with Tulane University in New Orleans under an organization named Association Haitienne de Developpement Humain, Inc (AHDH). This organization visits Haiti 3-4 times per year and perform hernia surgeries, eye surgeries, delivery of babies, care to adults and children for chronic and acute illnesses. They also provide support to the local medical team that is working with Haitian patients year round.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I would like to buy as many boxes of medicine as possible for $50 each. Ideally 4 boxes for $200. They have also requested other medicines for scabies and ringworm treatment for the children so I would use an additional $100 for this purpose.</p>
<p>In addition they need help to support the local health professionals who will be helping us in the hospital and clinics. They need $350 for an anesthesia nurse, $250 for a scrub nurse, and $500 for the local physician who works in the clinic year round. They also have a lunch program for the patients who cannot afford to buy food that costs $100. If I raise any additionaly money I will use it for these purposes.</p>
<p>What you get from me is a person going to help a community with the unique skill set of family medicine training so I am able to help with surgeries, perform delivery of babies, treat adults and children for medical problems. I am the only family medicine person that is going to Haiti this February.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is important because Haiti is one of the poorest nations in the world. Many of the persons there do not have access to clean water or food, and healthcare is considered a luxury. The AHDH is a great organization because they have committed to working with one community to uplift this community for over 20 years with access to healthcare and it does not stop there. They also have clean water and agriculture sustainability projects. They also work to educate the youth and adults so that they are building a Haitian medical force to help them to become independent in the future.</p>
<p>I have witnessed this impact firsthand through my work in Honduras. The work that my residency has been involved with through Shoulder to Shoulder over the past 20 years has helped to strengthen a community through access to healthcare and education. This community gets stronger each day and has so much potential for the future and knows what kinds of medical innovations that may come from these communities in the future that could change so many other lives.</p>

<p>The Bronner family has been making soap for 5 generations. The goal of this generation is to carry on the social and environmental ideals of our grandfather, Dr. Bronner. One of the ways we do this is by doing right by the farmers and workers who produce the raw materials in our soaps, which includes supporting development projects in their communities.</p>
<p>We invite you to be a part of an important initiative related to our palm oil project in Asuom, Ghana. Great work has been done there so far. As explained in the video above, Fair Trade funds have provided four deep water wells, living quarters for nurses at a local hospital and school supplies for children.</p>
<p>Our partners in Ghana have singled out malaria prevention as a top priority for their next community project and we need your help to make it a success. We are inviting you to help and support a project that will make a substantial improvement in quality of life for thousands of families in Ghana.</p>
<p>Malaria is spread by a single mosquito bite and causes extensive pain and suffering and prevents people from earning a living. In the district surrounding Asuom, an estimated 40% of the population is infected with malaria each year and a quarter of cases affect children under the age of 5.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.drbronner.com/indie/Bednet-Photo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be this way. Bed nets (also called mosquito nets) offer a simple and cost-effective solution. They create a protective barrier against often-deadly mosquito bites and allow families to sleep safely through the night. And they work: bed nets are known to reduce malaria transmissions by 90% in areas with high net coverage.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p><strong>We need to raise $25,000.</strong> Dr. Bronner's will match each dollar raised, with the goal of reaching a total of at least $50,000 to provide 5,000 bed nets for families in the communities where our palm oil is produced.</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.drbronner.com/indie/Ghana-Partners.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This project is unique because it has sprouted from Dr. Bronner's direct relationship with the community in Asuom, Ghana that produces the palm oil used in our bar soaps. The project is being run by our friends and business partners at Serendipalm, our sister project in Asuom, who are working to identify and meet healthcare needs in their community.</p>
<p>We are also raising awareness of the importance of creating and supporting fair and sustainable supply chains based on respect, transparency and direct relationships. If you support this idea, please consider supporting this project. </p>

<p>At Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps, we think of ourselves as the fighting soap company. The over 30,000 words spread across all the soap labels are the result of Dr. Bronner's life work of searching every religion and philosophy for ""Full Truths,"" which can be summed up in two beautiful sentences:</p>
<p><strong><em>1.</em></strong> <strong><em>”Constructive Capitalism is where you share the profit with the workers and the earth from which you made it!”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>2. “We are all brothers and sisters and we should take care of each other and spaceship earth!”</em></strong></p>

Note: we can not send Perks overseas for this campaign. We will only send Perks within the 50 United States and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

If you are having problems processing your donation through Paypal please see this Indiegogo help page for more information.
If we exceed our goal we will use the additional funds to support other critical healthcare initiatives in the region, including efforts to build a new maternity ward at the local hospital in Asuom. 
Impact

This project is unique because it has sprouted from Dr. Bronner's direct relationship with the community in Asuom, Ghana that produces the palm oil used in our bar soaps. The project is being run by our friends and business partners at Serendipalm, our sister project in Asuom, who are working to identify and meet healthcare needs in their community.
We are also raising awareness of the importance of creating and supporting fair and sustainable supply chains based on respect, transparency and direct relationships. If you support this idea, please consider supporting this project. 

At Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps, we think of ourselves as the fighting soap company. The over 30,000 words spread across all the soap labels are the result of Dr. Bronner's life work of searching every religion and philosophy for ""Full Truths,"" which can be summed up in two beautiful sentences:
1. ”Constructive Capitalism is where you share the profit with the workers and the earth from which you made it!”
2. “We are all brothers and sisters and we should take care of each other and spaceship earth!”
For more information on Dr. Bronner’s and our Fair Trade work and other activism around the world, check out our website.
All donations to this project are being coordinated by Dr. Bronner's Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization.

My name is Camille and I'm putting a call out to all you angels. I find myself at a profound crossroads in my life. This past year in particular has brought severe physical and emotional challenges including a serious illness and hospitalization; and currently the end of my 18 year relationship, which I've been deeply devoted to.</p>
<p>But as challenged as I have been through this past year, I am equally committed to making significant, positive changes in my life through recapturing my good health, returning to ""Me"", and finding my niche to make a meaningful contribution in the world.</p>
<p>Despite years of soul-searching and asking to be shown a Way, I've never discovered a ""GPS"" for locating a path to guide me to my life's purpose. To the contrary, I've set out on my own in numerous different directions, pursuing widely varied paths that I now feel took me off my natural course and, as a result, left me feeling lost.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>My Intention<br/></strong></span>But now I've found an innovative and comprehensive program of self-discovery that resonates deeply with me. Through immersing myself in a mostly-structured, 10-week pilgrimage to Thailand and Bali, I will have access to that GPS, to a map that I believe leads to a life path more in harmony with my true nature.</p>
<p>This pilgrimage will provide me the opportunity to expand my global perspective while further opening my heart and mind. Through extensive volunteer work, study, and personal reflection it will deepen my relationship with my Self, local and global communities, other sentient beings, and our environment while expanding my understanding of physical, emotional, and spiritual health and healing.</p>
<p>It also will culminate in my being certified in the sacred healing art of Thai Yoga Massage, a unique and magical combination of deep stretching, rhythmic compression, gentle rocking, energy balancing and acupressure. Its relaxed pace and fluid movements are nurturing and profoundly relaxing, creating a safe space for individuals to let go while feeling supported. This letting go is essential for everyone, but particularly for people whose sense of place or belonging has been lost, damaged or violated.</p>
<p>So, despite the 'nay-saying' voices of logic that regularly fill my head with all the reasonable-sounding arguments as to why I cannot possibly take the time, spend the money, 'not work', and leave my home and family obligations to retreat inward and reconnect with ""Me"", I choose to take this ""illogical"" leap of faith, and follow my heart.</p>
<p>I am eager, once I set foot upon this path, to return home and share my newfound insights and skills with YOU. And to get there I need your support!</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Where You Come In</strong></span><strong> </strong><strong>(or, It's Good to be Needed ;)) <br/></strong>I have been blessed to be a source of help, support and encouragement for others in my life – and I am happy and grateful to do it! It's how I roll. ;) And now, as I ask the Universe how to make the dream of this pilgrimage a reality, I'm being told, ""Camille, it's time to let others have the blessing of helping <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">you</span>; AND for you to learn to receive that blessing of support.""</p>
<p>We are the channels through which the blessings of the Universe flow. They don't fall from the sky and land on our doorsteps. We offer them to each other, according to our compassion and ability.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to have in you that community of support! Thank you so much for visiting my campaign and volunteering your valuable time to read my story. Blessings. Namaste.</p>

<p>Skai Juice and her husband,True Asiatic started Paradise Wellness in 2009 when they moved from Baltimore, MD to Luquillo, Puerto Rico. They offer a one week wellness retreat that incorporates a raw food dietary program with an island eco-fitness tour. During the one, two or three week retreat, guests get to experience hiking, swimming, biking, horseback riding, kayaking, salsa dancing and more! Skai is the Chef and Host of the program and True is the tour guide. They also have Iris Mercado for Ashtanga Yoga, and Carla Rivera, the Massage Therapist. They host groups from 2 people up to 30 people.  The retreats are housed in beachfront or rainforest villas, interchangeably, depending on the group type.</p>
<p>Skai Juice, Vegan and Raw Food Chef and Nutritional Consultant, is most noted for creating and establishing the very first vegan cafe in the city of Baltimore, called the Yabba Pot, back in 2002.  Timing was everything and her cafe boomed, as she was feeding customers from the neighboring Charles Village community as well as followers who traveled in as far as Philadelphia and DC. She also catered a multitude of events from Poetry Jams, Festivals, and glamourous weddings. Skai has been featured in every major news media in the Baltimore area, including: The City Paper, Baltimore Magazine, The Baltimore Sun, The Baltimore Times, The Afro, the Baltimore Journal, and Vegetarian Resource Guide's Vegetarian Journal...to name a few.</p>
<p>Paradise Wellness (<a href=""http://www.paradisewellness.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.paradisewellness.net</a>) is in a place where its needs a little financial love grease and some magical communal sponsorship. Paradise Wellness has been growing steadily and has worked her magic for the last few years.  Each and every retreat gets better than the last.  Skai and True need to generate some investment monies to fund a small marketing campaign. ""We have researched what it takes to bust this business out into the forefront..and what it takes is a creative marketing campaign,"" says True.</p>
<p>Paradise Wellness has a mission to help people to achieve a healthy and abundant life. The concept is a now-revolutionary movement...with Raw Food being the number one healing remedy for people and the planet as a whole because it promotes farming and sustainibility. ""Our goal is to be able to put our business in the front of as many people as possible, especially those who are challenged by issues related to the Standard American Dietary diseases: Diabetes, Cancer, Heart Disease, "" says Skai. ""Hopefully you can help!""</p>
<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<div>Our goal is to raise $12,000.  The money will be used to pay for a small advertising campaign, a colonic machine, and some retreat supplies. In addition, we plan to create a scholarship fund to assist those that want to attend a wellness retreat and are financially challenged.  Once these things are in place, we will be set on a sturdy foundation for all future retreats to come.
<p>For a few dollars, you will be an investor in the creation of something that will serve the lives of others, and possibly yourself too – we would love to have you with us!  Help us to help you (and others) heal the world!</p>
<p><strong>Why an IndieGoGo crowd funding campaign?</strong></p>
<p>Crowd funding has become one of the most popular tools to manifest all kinds of creative dreams. Really it feels like one big, beautiful act of community sharing where everybody wins and people are supported in shining even more in the world. </p>
<p>We are asking for your support in meeting our goal (and beyond!) and in helping spread the word to create a big BUZZ about Paradise Wellness. We were recently visited by an EBONY MAGAZINE writer and are awaiting that article to be released to help with this Buzz!</p>

<p><strong>The Backjack uses a unique combination of an upper torso lift, ancillary armrests and an adaptive lumbar support (memory foam) to help the body achieve natural relief from a variety of back discomforts by <em>decompressing the spine</em>, supporting the back, and creating correct posture.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Backjack relieves pressure from the lower back by lifting and holding the upper body in place. Gravity then seperates the lumbar vertebrate and eases discomfort. Although results do vary, pain relief is almost immediate for most users.</strong></p>

</div></div>","The Backjack is a light weight portable back relief system that provides relief for all types and severity of back issues. 

What makes the Backjack so innovative is its ease of use and mobility.  With a custom sized rib band the Backjack will fit almost every body type, tall, short, thin or round.

Backjack CAD Drawing (above)
 

The Backjack prototype shown in a car seat (above)
 
Who is the Backjack designed for?
The Backjack is designed to help those with severe back pain or those who need occasional relief.

When severe pain occurs, use the Backjack several times throughout the day to ease the area of irritation and help you rest.

Backjack being used at work (above)
 
When minor discomfort occurs after work or from participation in a sporting event, the Backjack can be used to help provide relief from the constant exertion of the day.


Relieves stiffness after golfing or other physical activity (above)
 
In fact, when used just 10 minutes each day, the Backjack becomes a preventative maintenance treatment that helps individuals continue their active lifestyle.  By reducing or eliminating pain the Backjack helps you function as a normal well rested person.
Easy to use through out the day (above) 
 
Is the Backjack easy to use?
The true genius of this item is captured within its ease of use and mobility. When compared to other methods of treatments involving special tables, pullies, levers and heavy equipment, it is easy to see why the Backjack is a better alternative.
The Backjack has one-step folding, quick connect buckles and adjustable straps.

One step folding lets the Backjack travel with you, it even fits inside the average suitcase (above)
 
Where can the Backjack be used?
This unit can be placed on a chair at home, in the office, on an airplane or in a car.  Set up and begin to feel the relief in a few short minutes.

<p>Hello, my name is Melissa and I am
a full time Masters student Studying Ethics in New York City. I have worked for
several non-profit organizations through my education and have traveled to
Ecuador to build houses for those in need. My life has been truly blessed and
now I have found a new way to help others. </p>
<p> A few years ago, I began practicing yoga and
discovered the ways in which this practice can change someone's life. I know it
personally has changed mine. I have discovered true joy in life through this
practice and I have seen the ways in which yoga can brighten someone’s spirit. </p>
<p>It has become a dream of mine to
become a certified yoga instructor but unfortunately my education has drained
all of my funds. </p>
<p>There is a teacher training this
summer at Yoga to the People in New York City and I would be honored to
participate. I plan on using my certification to host free classes around the
city, to show others how they can find inner peace through the self-love
promoted throughout yogic practice. There are several churches in my
neighborhood that have agreed to provide the space for community classes as
long as they have someone who can provide instruction. Most of the people who
attend these classes are homeless or unable to pay for healthy activities such
as yoga. With your help I can become a certified yoga instructor and I can
spend my time during the week helping others in need through the benefits of
this practice.</p>
<p>The training costs $2,800. It is a
10-week intensive yoga certification. Once certified, I will be certified for
life.  If I am not able to get the
required funds by the first certification cycle, I will continue to work hard
in order to make the next round of teacher training.</p>
<p>Living in New York City I am
surrounded by the homeless and the impoverished. These people are ignored by
almost everyone else in this city because most people don’t realize that we are
one mistake away from being where they are. </p>
<p>Yoga is inherently inspirational.
It is all about the connections we can make within ourselves and with the rest
of humanity. Yoga gives me a reason to wake up in the morning. It can do the
same for the people I hope to teach one day. I want to show these people that
we have not forgotten about them, that we value them as individuals who can
contribute to society, and that we all deserve love. Yoga is a practice of
learning to love one’s self. </p>
<p>Even if you cannot contribute you
can still help by spreading the word on my campaign. There is a way of sharing
my campaign with your friends. </p>
<p>This would be the greatest gift I
have ever received and I am truly humbled by the generosity and kindness we are
capable of showing to one another. </p>
<p>Please help me to help others.</p>
<p><b>Namaste</b></p>

<p>One of the fastest growing concerns of the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">World Health Organization</span> and the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">US Environmental Protection Agency</span> is the increasing amount of bacteriafound in both surface and ground water supplies creating a major source of sickness and disease worldwide.  </p>
<p>In most cases the source of contamination is linked directly to septic waste disposal systems.  The reality is that 90% of the time septic failure is due to malfunctions of leach fields that are expected to do the bulk of the sewage processing in conventional systems.  This monumental problem of critical proportions is best summarized in the W.H.O. SEPTIC WASTE REPORT.   <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/20328.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/20328.php</a></p>
<p>Unsafe water and poor sanitation cause 4000 children to die each day according to World Health Organization.  But the problems associated with residential waste disposal are not limited to under-developed or third world countries.  Individual septic systems for treating residential sewage have long been used in sparsely populated areas in the U.S. where municipal systems are neither practical nor affordable.  The U.S. Census reports that there are over 26.1 million such systems in use in the US alone. </p>
<p>The ProMark solution to this problem is the Purifier Septic System.  Unlike traditional septic systems The Purifier completes ALL of the sewage processing within its tank rendering leach/drain fields obsolete.  This is because the Purifier system is engineered to totally process and perform a final stage pasteurization rendering all harmful bacteria and pathogens harmless at the tank discharge. </p>
<p>The premise of The Purifier’s biodegradation process is a<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> reactive containment chamber</span>, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">a sonic pulverizing section</span>, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">stable settling (density separation and liquid layering</span>), <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">homogenizing and mixing section</span>, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">filtering and aeration section</span>, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">aeration and a final stage pasteurizing section.</span>  </p>
<p>The engineering talent behind the Purifier System is a graduate of UCLA with several patents in this principle area of concentration centered in advanced organic chemistry.  Michael J Waddell, who heads up the marketing for the Purifier received his BA from the University of Iowa with Graduate Studies at the University of Missouri at Kansas City.  </p>
<p>ProMark is seeking $43,500 to build the manufacturing prototype and do proof of concept field testing of the Purifier Septic System.  This is a venture where the principles are putting “skin-in-the-game”.  The monies you contribute will be directly budgeted for fabricating the full size prototype, establishing field test sites along with some limited marketing in key territories. </p>
<p>Here is why we believe that the Purifier is needed today:</p>
<h6 align=""center"">Purifier Septic System™</h6>
<ul>
<li>Eliminates the spread of bacterial diseases (meningitis, E.Coli, etc) that can be introduced into the environment from poorly maintained or substandard      septic systems</li>
<li>Has no leach or drain field – consists of a single tank (processor) only</li>
<li>Provides (assures) a cleaner, safer, healthier environment. Ideally suited for use on hillsides, close to ponds, streams, the ocean, on islands and near reservoirs.</li>
<li> Will be competitively priced.</li>
<li>Completely unaffected by weather conditions. Is totally unaffected by rainfall, soil conditions, or drainage.  Amount of rainfall, flood plain areas or the height of the water table can never influence the operation</li>
<li>Eliminated drain fields free up land that homeowners can use for other purposes. No contamination of ground around tank</li>
<li>The system is entirely fail-safe and will operate maintenance free as a      hands-off operation</li>
<li>Is adaptable to small communities</li>
<li>Gives a significant increase to the value of property</li>
<li>Pasteurization used as final step in purification; <strong>100% of pathogenic bacteria are fully destroyed.</strong> </li>
<li>Performance/efficiency easily monitored</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason we are seeking the modest sum of $43,500  is because we have self-funded much of the costs like preliminary engineering and basic overhead. </p>
<p>Based on preliminary contacts with householders and small villages that have existing septic problems we believe that the Purifier will quickly be embraced as the solution of choice.  Given the operational proof of the Purifier Septic System we believe that both end users as well as licensees will be knocking on our door to have access to the system. </p>
<p>I hope that you will help us shortcut the “system” so that we may help stamp out water borne disease and return leach-bed land to good uses. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Orean Cosby.  I am a 63 year old mother of three children and 5 grandchildren. I am a gospel singer/songwriter, pastor and teacher. On January 14th, I was given the devastating news that the tissues that were removed during surgery was cancerous and although breast cancer has rarely been found in this area, it was indeed breast cancer.  My prognosis was Stage 4 breast cancer and it was later determined through testing that the cancer had metastisized throughout my entire skeleton.</p>
<p>Because I have experienced the affects of this diagnosis on my mental, emotional and physical well being, I have become more passionate about helping others in similar circumstances. Therefore I am sponsoring an afternoon of inspiration, hope, love, encouragment and prayer for other cancer and sickle cell anemia patient/survivors.</p>
<p>Although we may experience pain on a daily basis or have to endure hours of treatment, what goes on in the mind of those affected can do more damage than the condition itself.  I have experienced nights of fear and afraid to go to sleep wondering whether I would wake up in the morning or not.  But I thank God for the firm foundation of faith in the Word of God that reminds me and enables me to continue to live day by day holding on to my faith.  However, I come in contact with so many who do not have this kind of support and too many are dying before time due to the lack of inspirational, emotional, and mental support. And this is the purpose of the event called ""The Gift""</p>
<strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong>
</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>We need $3,500 to defray the cost of the hotel ballroom where the luncheon will be held and to feed 50 patients and 50 caregivers.  Contributors will have the opportunity to visit the website to view pictures and/or videos of the events of the day. This event is being sponsored by Mashiyach Ministries, an IRS 501 (c) 3 tax exempt organization, therefore all gifts are tax deductible. If we are unable to raise the entire amount of this campaign, we will have to modify how many patients we will be able to accommodate. </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
In December 2010, I began this event,""The Gift"" as a worship service in support of Sickle Cell Anemia. The very next month I received my diagnosis, so instead of cancelling the event, I added to the cause Breast Cancer.  There are many campaigns to raise money for research in the area of advanced breast cancer but I choose to do something that can personnally impact individuals right where they are. A smile, a touch, an encouraging word from another individual goes a long way toward the well being of a person. Some patients don't get out except for their doctors appointments and treatments. The impact of attending this social event and having folks there to show patient/survivors that someone cares and that their life and well being matters will go a long way in their hearts after the event is over. As a contributor, you will have the joy of knowing that you have helped to bring a glimmer of light into the hearts of 50 patients and caregivers.</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
For those who may not be able to contribute financially to this campaign, it would be very helpful if you utilize the ""word of mouth"" method to help us get the word out.

<h3>What We Need and Perks for You:</h3>
<p>We need funding for design and equipment. Right now I'm doing the design and construction for a single prototype. All money will go to sensors, microcontrollers, testing equipment, and so forth. </p>
<p>Donations of $25 and above will recieve a signed 'Thank You' card from myself, and two of my blind friends who will be helping with the testing of the prototype!<br/><br/>Donations of $100 will get to pick an eight bar song that plays randomly when the device is first activated. Due to onboard memory limitations, only 20 songs will be avalible. </p>
<p>Donations of $500 will get all the above perks, and have a 'Bat' Glove made and donated in their name to the Jackson School for the Blind. </p>
<p>Anything above the requested total amount of $1500 will be used to make copies of the finalized prototype that will be donated to the Mississippi School for the Blind. I'll make as many as possible with the extra funds. <br/><br/><img alt=""3D Rendering of Circuit Board"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/oTTMU.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;"" title=""Circuit Board in 3D""/></p>

<h3>Poject Details:</h3>
<p>In recent years there has been a significant increase in the use of computerised systems as a form of assistive technology for the disabled. The visually impaired have recently gained access to computerized screen readers, enhanced magnification of visual imagery, and braille based computer systems. However, it seems that modern technology has not helped in assistance with location awareness. Rather than using the existing technological capabilities available, the visually impaired seem to be stuck with 19th century solutions of using service dogs and canes to traverse the world. It seems to be a strange paradox that, in a world filled with GPS devices and Internet accessible devices, the visually impaired should not be so limited in technological options for navigation.</p>
<p>The concept of this project is to create a low cost, hand mounted device which analyses the surrounding environment, then provides environmental data to the user through the use of haptic feedback in order to aid navigation for the visually impaired.</p>
<p>The navigation system is based primarily on the pioneering work of J.M. Loomis and his team's research into spatial analysis for the visually impaired. His work focused primarily on instrumentation which collected data in a 360 degree radius around the user, which was then fed into computer systems which provided vibrational feedback to the user based on the range of obstacles in all directions. The limitation of such systems is the cost due to large amounts of instrumentation, the vest which the user must wear which is both heavy and unfashionable, the potential of false positives due to movement of the users limbs, and excessive power consumption from the data analysis and necessary instrumentation. <br/><br/>The prototype that I am proposing uses the same concept of haptic feedback from data collected from instrumentation, but limits the flaws inherent in the systems designed by Loomis. By having a pair of ultrasonic range sensors mounted to the back of the users hand as the data collection system, the power consumption of the device is kept to a minimum, would be lightweight, and work in a manner similar to navigating with a cane; a skill that most visually impaired people have grown accustomed to.<br/><br/>TLDR; We are working on a low cost device to help blind people 'see'. </p>

</div></div>","**********MASSIVE UPDATE**********We met funding goals, we will be going open source! What this means is that ANYONE who wants to make their own glove rather than buying from us can do just that. Project Info:
Imagine a world where a mother can watch for the first time as her blind child can grasp a glass of milk without fumbling to find it. 
Imagine a world where the equipment that a blind man needs to navigate is always with him, and takes up no extra space. Imagine a world where the blind can easily always know where everyone is around them, increasing their personal safty, as well as reducing the chance for accidental embarassment. This is the world this project is trying to create with your help.

<p>I apologize but due to a unexpected crisis I need to put this campain on hold. I am unable to cancel it according to Indiego policies so we ask that you DO NOT make a contribution at this time. Once able we will continue our fundraising efforts for a darn good cause....</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the 1970's there was 1 out of every 2,000. </p>
<p>In 2000 it was 1 out of every 150.</p>
<p>By 2005 it became 1 out of every 100</p>
<p>Today it is now 1 out of every 88 children are being diagnosed as having some form of autism.</p>
<p>This is totally unacceptable, especially when considering how easy it can be to prevent this condition…</p>
<p>Newborn babies now enter this world already having several hundred man-made chemicals and heavy metals present in their blood. They then begin nursing where even more chemicals and heavy metals contaminants are potentially in their mother’s breast milk. </p>
<p>Mercury, having been found in both newborns umbilical blood and mother’s breast milk when tested, is often used as a preservative in the medical industry because of its strong antimicrobial (antibacterial) properties.</p>
<p>This one substance alone could prove to have a devastating effect to the different types of micro flora that were meant to be passed from the mother to her newborn baby during the birthing and breastfeeding process. The micro flora is a complex network of trillions of health benefiting bacteria that have been found to play a critical role in the baby’s future growth and development, especially their immune system.                                                                    </p>
<h3>                         <strong>Where is the mercury coming from?</strong>
</h3>
<p>Used for 175 years in the dental industry to make silver amalgam fillings, people with these type of fillings inhale and exhale the mercury vapors that is continually being released from them.</p>
<p>Used for 75 years as a preservative (Thimerosal) in children’s immunizations, flu, tetanus shots, medical creams, and eye drops.</p>
<p>A byproduct of fuel exhaust at ground level and coal burning that pollutes the upper atmosphere.</p>
<p>The increase production and improper disposal of fluorescent light bulbs which contain more mercury than incandescent bulbs. (Fluorescent lights also have a stressful effect on the body.)</p>
<p>With all of these, and many other, sources over the years having contributed to the contamination of air and fresh water sources.</p>
<p>A common symptom of autistic children is that they have inadequate amount of micro flora (beneficial bacteria) throughout their gastrointestinal tract, including the digestive system.</p>
<p>While many types of bacteria are killed by mercury there are a few strains that not only survive exposure to it they actually thrive when absorbing mercury inside their cell. After processing it they release a more harmful substance called methlymercury.</p>
<p>These types of bacteria can be found in different environments. In water they are responsible for contaminating different species of fish with methylated mercury making them dangerous to consume too much of. It needs to be questioned whether or not these same types of bacteria may possibly be present in people’s mouths and/or throughout the gastrointestinal tract, potentially converting the mercury contaminations in these areas into a much more toxic form within the body.</p>
<p>These are a few of the major contributing factors causing not just autism but many different health challenges which can surface at any time throughout a person’s life. The types of contaminants found in a newborns body and the effects these have to its development, including the micro flora needed for the immune system, can also lead to other diseases such as leukemia, multiple sclerosis, cancer etc.</p>
<p>It is a critical time for people to learn about the recent discoveries of how the human body functions and to reassess how their consumer choices may be affecting their health. Once this is accomplished the next goal should be to learn how to reduce and eliminate as many potentially harmful exposures as possible while properly protecting your everyday environments.

<span style=""color: #ff9900;""><strong>Ian's Story</strong></span><br/><br/>My nephew Ian. What can I say he is the most amazing child I have ever met with the most amazing sense of humor and always greats you with a smile. He is resilient and strong yet every day he faces pain constant pain.<br/><br/>Ian has what's known as EB (Epidermolysis Bullosa). you may ask ""what is that""? Well it is an inherited connective tissue disease causing blisters in the skin and mucosal membranes, Its severity ranges from mild to lethal.<br/><br/>As a result, the skin is extremely fragile. Minor friction or trauma will separate the layers of the skin and form blisters. Often referred to as Butterfly Children due to the fact that their skin is as fragile as the wings of a butterfly. It's much like a severe burn in Ian's case all over his body. Ian lives in severe pain on constant pain medication to try to help keep him comfortable. <br/><br/>A bump or scratch or even moving the wrong way can case the skin blister and break. It's a constant battle, one area of the skin heals and then blisters again or won't heal at all. Scar tissue develops making it even worse restricting the movement of arms and legs and even opening the mouth. It doesn't stop there, blisters also develop internally in the eyes, nose, mouth and throat. For EB kids the risk of infection is high and can be fatal. Regular bandage changes are required and are nothing short of horrible and extremely painful.</h3>
<h3>Ian has also been diagnosed with Cirrhosis of the liver and his liver is leaking fluid into his adominal area. Ian is on medication to help reduce the fluid but the doctors are unable to work out why this is happening. They do not believe they will be able to stop this and can only treat it with medication in hopes to reduce the fluid.<br/><br/>In short it is a horrific disease, extremely painful and debilitating. Ian was born with RDEB which is considered to be a severe strain of this disease. Ian is bandaged from head to toe  with blistering and open wounds over most of his body. Ian is unable to walk and is confined to a wheel <br/>chair. Ian can not sit up on his own or dress himself and requires constant care. When born Ian was not given much chance of survival and wasn't expected<br/>to still be with us today. It is a shear miracle Ian is still with us today and has reached the age of 14.<br/><br/>87% of children born with one of the more sever forms of EB like Ian's do not live more then 12 months. <br/><br/>Ian enjoys arts and crafts, likes painting and drawing and watching the Food Network on TV. He enjoys spending time with his Brothers and Sister and his little kitten. Ian dreams of being a Firefighter when he grows up. He collects firefighting memorabilia and just loves all things do do with firefighting. He has an amazing attitude for a child who is in so much pain. With all the procedures he has to endure Ian still <br/>manages to retain his sense of humor and I don't know how.<br/><br/><br/>The cost alone of the trips to and from Cincinnati for long periods of time is to much for my sister to endure. Ian being confined to a wheel chair making travel all together difficult. By car it is an 8 hour drive from Pennsylvania to Ohio. <br/><br/>Ian and my sister will have to travel alone to Ohio and stay for long periods of time. Ian has always had trouble in recovering for any procedure and gets very sick after words during this recovery time Ian will not be able to travel home until he is 100%, again making the stays very long. <br/><br/>Ian's brothers and sister have to continue with school and my sisters husband has to continue work to keep the roof over their head and it is going to be impossible for them to manage all this without help. A one income family who is struggling to survive as it is can not possible manage this and that's why we need your help.<br/><br/>Our aim is to raise as much as we can to help cover the costs for Ian's trips to Cincinnati Ohio over the next year.<br/><br/>Any future medical care for Ian will be address in Cincinnati as they have the specialist with the experience needed to treat Ian. The local hospital where Ian has been treated feels that Ian's medical needs have become to specialized for them to continue to handle. So Ian will now be faced with traveling to Cincinnati for just about everything.<br/><br/>We just can't afford to cover the trips to Ohio and all the expences that are mounting daily. The family is struggling and recieves no assistance other then donations. They are a one income family fighting each day along side Ian.<br/><br/>If you could find in your heart to help Ian it would mean the world to Ian and his family. Any donation no matter how small can help. If you would like to offer any assistance at all in any way please email at helpian@hotmail.com.<br/><br/>We will be posting regular updates on Ian's Facebook Page, Twitter Page &amp; Blog.<br/><br/>Facebook: <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/ian.swarr.37"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">www.facebook.com/ian.swarr.37</a></span> please follow Ian's Story. <br/><br/>You can visit Ian's web page: <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.helpian.weebly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">www.helpian.weebly.com</a></span><br/><br/>Follow Ian on Twitter: <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""https://twitter.com/HelpIan1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">https://twitter.com/HelpIan1</a></span>

It doesn't stop there, blisters also develop internally in the eyes, nose, mouth and throat. For EB kids the risk of infection is high and can be fatal. Regular bandage changes are required and are nothing short of horrible and extremely painful.
Ian has also been diagnosed with Cirrhosis of the liver and his liver is leaking fluid into his adominal area. Ian is on medication to help reduce the fluid but the doctors are unable to work out why this is happening. They do not believe they will be able to stop this and can only treat it with medication in hopes to reduce the fluid.In short it is a horrific disease, extremely painful and debilitating. Ian was born with RDEB which is considered to be a severe strain of this disease. Ian is bandaged from head to toe  with blistering and open wounds over most of his body. Ian is unable to walk and is confined to a wheel chair. Ian can not sit up on his own or dress himself and requires constant care. When born Ian was not given much chance of survival and wasn't expectedto still be with us today. It is a shear miracle Ian is still with us today and has reached the age of 14.87% of children born with one of the more sever forms of EB like Ian's do not live more then 12 months. Ian enjoys arts and crafts, likes painting and drawing and watching the Food Network on TV. He enjoys spending time with his Brothers and Sister and his little kitten. Ian dreams of being a Firefighter when he grows up. He collects firefighting memorabilia and just loves all things do do with firefighting. He has an amazing attitude for a child who is in so much pain. With all the procedures he has to endure Ian still manages to retain his sense of humor and I don't know how.The cost alone of the trips to and from Cincinnati for long periods of time is to much for my sister to endure. Ian being confined to a wheel chair making travel all together difficult. By car it is an 8 hour drive from Pennsylvania to Ohio. Ian and my sister will have to travel alone to Ohio and stay for long periods of time. Ian has always had trouble in recovering for any procedure and gets very sick after words during this recovery time Ian will not be able to travel home until he is 100%, again making the stays very long. Ian's brothers and sister have to continue with school and my sisters husband has to continue work to keep the roof over their head and it is going to be impossible for them to manage all this without help. A one income family who is struggling to survive as it is can not possible manage this and that's why we need your help.Our aim is to raise as much as we can to help cover the costs for Ian's trips to Cincinnati Ohio over the next year.Any future medical care for Ian will be address in Cincinnati as they have the specialist with the experience needed to treat Ian. The local hospital where Ian has been treated feels that Ian's medical needs have become to specialized for them to continue to handle. So Ian will now be faced with traveling to Cincinnati for just about everything.We just can't afford to cover the trips to Ohio and all the expences that are mounting daily. The family is struggling and recieves no assistance other then donations. They are a one income family fighting each day along side Ian.If you could find in your heart to help Ian it would mean the world to Ian and his family. Any donation no matter how small can help. If you would like to offer any assistance at all in any way please email at helpian@hotmail.com.We will be posting regular updates on Ian's Facebook Page, Twitter Page & Blog.Facebook: www.facebook.com/ian.swarr.37 please follow Ian's Story.

<p>“Laneah” is a cosmetic line that will provide consumers with quality organic skin care and bath products that smell tempting enough to eat. The products include lotions, creams, moisturizers, body butters, bath salts, bath bombs, lip balms, hair mists. Our products will be available to order online as well as distributed at local farmers’ markets and health stores.</p>
<p><strong>Our Vision:</strong></p>
<p>We believe that it is important that the product not only feels good and is good for you , but also includes some of your favorite aroma. We will provide customers with the opportunity to customize their product with the smells they love.</p>
<p>Our products are safe, therefore if consumed by accident, it won’t harm the body. We believe in the simple concept that you shouldn’t smother on products that will be harmful to the insides of your body.</p>
<p>We focus on aroma, just as much as the rest of our ingredients. Smell should be pleasing, inviting, tempting, and amazingly delicious almost to the point of being addictive. This is a combination that most of today’s organic cosmetic producers lack. How frustrating is it to get this amazing lotion that has all of these nourishing qualities, but it doesn’t quite fit your taste of smell. Maybe you are a chocolate nut, who loves the smell of cocoa, chocolate, coffee, we got your stuff. Maybe you are a sweet tooth that dreams in cupcakes, candy, and everything sweet, we got you covered. Or maybe you are one of those “one with nature people” who love the smell of rain, freshly cut grass or a bed of flowers, we got it.

<p>Our product uses natural and refined vegetable and fruit oils and butters. They are enriched with natural vitamins and infused with herb extracts. Our products are themed to serve you better, some rejuvenate and moisturize your skin, while others (like our bath salts) use aromatherapy to help you sleep better, beat the sniffles, relax after a long hard day, or just hop in the bathtub for some extra mood boosting.</p>
<p>Who says that organic and natural has to be plane? We are flirty, we are sassy, and we will make you feel sexy and hip, while taking good care of your skin.

<p>The scar tissue in my mothers esophagus
is so severe she cant swallow anything.  Over the years of
uncontrollable acid reflux disease (severe heartburn) the acids from
her digestive tract have eaten away the lining of the esophagus tube.
 Her tract is so narrow it fills with saliva and a bile type
substance and blocks any food and drink from passing to the stomach. 
She is in so much pain she has to vomit over and over just to clear
enough space to drink a smoothie or protein shake just to get enough
nutrition to stay alive!!  On a very rare occasion she can eat solid
food, maybe once in a 2 to 3 week period.  Her body is literally
eating itself alive.  The only other way to eat is I.V. But that
doesn’t taste very good!!  I listed a short video on the procedure
she must have done to help her.  However she must have two surgeries
due to the severity of her case.  Her job provides no health care!</p>
<p>
</p><p>    First doctors must remove the scar
tissue that has build up by stripping it off of her esophageal
lining.  This is a very painful procedure and must be preformed over
several sessions.  The second is in the video where they stretch her
lining back out so the saliva and hopefully food can pass to the
stomach.  Once again this takes several procedures to take effect. 
Please help my eat again!! I would love to take her out for a steak
or crab dinner instead of the smoothie shop!

Their family members give two main reasons. Any
gradual deterioration in health for grandma usually goes <u>undetected</u> and surfaces only when
there is an adverse event, such as a fall. Secondly, when the adverse event
does happen, grandpa is afraid that there will be <u>no one to find him</u>
and provide him timely medical care.</p><p></p><h3>We have a solution..</h3><p></p>Agility4Life addresses both these aspects and enables seniors to age gracefully at home without compromising on independence and the quality of life they have always cherished.<p></p><p>Agility4Life is building a radically improved health monitoring system, an easy-to-install in-home
sensor solution, that continuously analyzes movement and gait patterns to
provide general health assessments, detect and alert adverse events, such as
falls or lack of movement, for seniors who live alone.</p><p></p><p>Our solution brings
together latest sensor and imaging technologies to monitor seniors
unobtrusively and uses sophisticated algorithms to recommend timely
interventions by physicians, family members and caregivers <u>only</u> when
needed, giving seniors complete privacy, while providing timely care. Unlike pendants, watches or other devices that seniors usually forget to carry or wear while at home, our system is unobtrusive, always-on and does not require the senior to do anything.</p>
<p>Another key differentiator
for Agility4Life is that we are building a holistic solution that combines both
preventative and responsive aspects of care, under the guidance of leading
practitioners of geriatric medicine and the latest medical research.</p>
<p>With seniors, 65 and
older, expected to reach 1.3 billion worldwide in five years, Agility4Life will
solve a looming problem at a lower cost and serve a
noble cause.</p><h3>Who we are..</h3><p></p><p>Agility4Life has
been started by two Duke MBA alums - Uday Kiran Chaka (Daytime ’06), Justin Ho
(Daytime ’06) and Seshadri Srinivasan, a PhD in Electrical Engineering. We were runners-up at linkAges Innovation Challenge organized by Palo Alto Medical Foundation &amp; Health 2.0, and have continued to work on the idea. We are guided by reputed academics, geriatricians, and industry experts in this field. I have included more information about the core team towards the end.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Where we are in the journey..</h3><p>We have a fully-working prototype that we are using for a beta trial with a Senior Housing organization
in San Francisco and we are improving our algorithms continuously. Our prototype is
based on hacked commodity hardware and proprietary software that work seamlessly to
provide the most accurate information about the activity patterns of the
seniors.</p>Our biggest challenge is to reduce the size of the prototype by building optimized hardware on our own. We are in touch with hardware designer and vendors who have assured us that a smaller form factor is feasible and reduce unit costs significantly.<p></p><p><b>You </b>can help us hire the hardware vendor, build a smaller prototype, obtain regulatory approvals and manufacture the product in <b>2014</b>.

</div></div>","Grandma, who lives alone, is worried..We all know stories of grandma or grandpa who are leaving their home of more than 30 years and reluctantly moving to assisted living facilities or nursing homes. Their family members give two main reasons. Any
gradual deterioration in health for grandma usually goes undetected and surfaces only when
there is an adverse event, such as a fall. Secondly, when the adverse event
does happen, grandpa is afraid that there will be no one to find him
and provide him timely medical care.We have a solution..Agility4Life addresses both these aspects and enables seniors to age gracefully at home without compromising on independence and the quality of life they have always cherished.Agility4Life is building a radically improved health monitoring system, an easy-to-install in-home
sensor solution, that continuously analyzes movement and gait patterns to
provide general health assessments, detect and alert adverse events, such as
falls or lack of movement, for seniors who live alone.Our solution brings
together latest sensor and imaging technologies to monitor seniors
unobtrusively and uses sophisticated algorithms to recommend timely
interventions by physicians, family members and caregivers only when
needed, giving seniors complete privacy, while providing timely care. Unlike pendants, watches or other devices that seniors usually forget to carry or wear while at home, our system is unobtrusive, always-on and does not require the senior to do anything.
Another key differentiator
for Agility4Life is that we are building a holistic solution that combines both
preventative and responsive aspects of care, under the guidance of leading
practitioners of geriatric medicine and the latest medical research.
With seniors, 65 and
older, expected to reach 1.3 billion worldwide in five years, Agility4Life will
solve a looming problem at a lower cost and serve a
noble cause.Who we are..Agility4Life has
been started by two Duke MBA alums - Uday Kiran Chaka (Daytime ’06), Justin Ho
(Daytime ’06) and Seshadri Srinivasan, a PhD in Electrical Engineering. We were runners-up at linkAges Innovation Challenge organized by Palo Alto Medical Foundation & Health 2.0, and have continued to work on the idea. We are guided by reputed academics, geriatricians, and industry experts in this field. I have included more information about the core team towards the end.Where we are in the journey..We have a fully-working prototype that we are using for a beta trial with a Senior Housing organization
in San Francisco and we are improving our algorithms continuously. Our prototype is
based on hacked commodity hardware and proprietary software that work seamlessly to
provide the most accurate information about the activity patterns of the
seniors.Our biggest challenge is to reduce the size of the prototype by building optimized hardware on our own. We are in touch with hardware designer and vendors who have assured us that a smaller form factor is feasible and reduce unit costs significantly.You can help us hire the hardware vendor, build a smaller prototype, obtain regulatory approvals and manufacture the product in 2014. Without your help, we have to continue at our current pace and spend another year and launch our product in 2015. Help us improve lives of seniors sooner!What We Need & What You GetWe need $25,000 to hire a hardware vendor to turn our prototype into a product. So far, we have been funding all the work on our own. We need your support to take us to the next level.$10,000 will let us engage the vendor and start the miniaturization immediately.Additional $15,000 will help us complete the testing, obtain regulatory approvals and create packaged products.We thank our supporters (you!) warmly and want to recognize your contributions with valuable perks that you will love. Please contribute richly!Impact of Your Contribution2014 is a make-or-break year for us - we will make a viable product or close shop.We have been working on this product for the past two years, spending countless hours away from family and friends, to make the world a better place for grandma and grandpa.Your contributions will give us the needed encouragement to continue our good work. Other Ways You Can HelpYou may not have a grandma or grandpa that needs our product.

<p>We start with Eye of Round beef.  It is an expensive cut  But quality is number one  with Hawaiian Dave.  It is lean, 97% fat-free, and tender.  Not too much marbling like some cuts, but enough to give it the right amount of flavor.  We cut it across the grain.  This makes it easy to chew.  If you've ever had steak that you could cut with a fork, that's how it is to chew jerky that's been cut across the grain.  Then we marinade it for over 16 hours overnight in our special blend of ingredients and spices.  Most jerky is marinaded for just a few hours giving you just a taste of the flavor, but like chewing gum the flavor's gone in just a few seconds.  Our Jerky has the flavor through and through with every chew! </p>

Creating a Gourmet Beef Jerky that is delicious and affordable has been my passon!  I LOVE to cook! Most store bought Jerky is tough or tasteless.  They are made with additives and preservatives that are not healthy for us!  I wanted to make a Jerky that was unique, healthy and delicious.

<h3> Our Campaign</h3>
<p>  Hello, my name is Adel Elseri and I am the proud inventor of the ""<strong>Tongue2Teeth"", </strong>the world's first tongue-mounted toothbrush. I am a boilermaker by trade, but I've had a passion for oral hygiene for my entire life. </p>
<p>  My campaign started when I found the need to brush my teeth, on-the-go, without actually having a toothbrush and toothpaste with me. I wanted it to be discreet and convenient because I knew that chewing gum and using mouthwash wouldn't have the same effect of physically cleaning my teeth, tongue and gums. The ""<strong>T2T</strong>"" is a ""dispoable after one use"" device, adding to its conveniency. Each unit has a coating on the inside that kills bacteria on the tongue, however, a toothpaste coating on the outside that whitens your teeth and protects your gums. With its unique packaging, the ""<strong>T2T</strong>"" has a hands-free exchange method which elimates any possibility of contamination.</p>
<p>  By receiving your contributions, we will be able to finalize the ""<strong>Tongue2Teeth</strong>"" and make it an internationally renowned product. With your help, the ""<strong>T2T</strong>"" will allow people with physical disablities to regain their independance by brushing their own teeth.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>  We are aiming to raise around $100,000 to fund more research &amp; development on the proper CSA/FDA material needed to perfect the ""<strong>T2T</strong>"". Currently, we have developped our first prototype with micro pyramids as the primary cleaning tool, we also have a second prototype in the works  that uses bristles for the cleaning action. At this time, we have temporary packaging, that can be seen in the video above, that shows the concept of hands-free exchange, however, added funds will allow us to make our packaging even more convenient for the consumer. </p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">There is an average of seventy million American’s diagnosed with digestive disorders every year. More Americans are rushing to their doctors to treat conditions like heartburn, gas, GERD, SIBO, IBS, ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease. More digestive diseases and problems are also being discovered every day. The most concerning aspect of all these conditions is that science and natural medicine are way ahead of the curve in treating all of these problems. Even though this is true most people only rely on conventional medicine. Conventional medicine is great for emergency procedures and life threatening conditions, but has a horrible tract record for treating preventable conditions and diseases.</span></p>
<p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center; line-height: normal;""><strong style=""""><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Examples of Mainstream Medicine Being Wrong About Digestive Issues</span></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"" style=""""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">1.     Ulcers were only caused by stress and too much stomach acid. Scientists discovered in the 1980’s that H. Pylori was the main cause of stomach ulcers. Mainstream medicine didn’t accept this fact until the mid 1990’s. Millions of Americans were mistreated with antacids, H2 antagonists, and PPI’s. H. Pylori as the main cause of ulcers was never addressed during this time and may patients suffered.<br style=""""/></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"" style=""""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">2.    Another common misconception is that the only cause of Heartburn is excess acid in the stomach.  Since most people have a basic understanding of physics (that doctors seem not to grasp), stomach acid can't travel up the esophagus by itself because of gravity. Also the LES prevents stomach contents from leaving the stomach as much as possible (this would explain why stomach acid doesn’t come up when you lay down or are upside down). Excess stomach acid cannot be the sole reason for GERD. GERD can be caused by too little stomach acid, which over time causes gas buildup in the stomach and small intestine. GERD can also be caused by a weakened LES from gas pressure, Hiatal Hernia putting pressure on the stomach and LES, SIBO, and Lack of Digestive Enzymes leading to increased gas and food allergies.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"" style=""""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">3.     Ulcerative Colitis and Crohns Disease sufferers are also having the same problem today, since science has already proved that these diseases are caused by the Mycobacterium Avium. The main source of Mycobacerium Avium in humans is improperly pasteurized milk. Mainstream medicine still treats these conditions as only autoimmune disorders sadly.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">All of these can be treated with simple supplementation and lifestyle changes. Mainstream medicine will only offer medicine for the rest of one's life as an answer to these medical problems. One of the proposed reasons why the actual cause of these diseases isn’t addressed properly is because the huge amount of money that can be made if a patient is on the drug for the rest of their life. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Most doctors, pharmacists, chemists, mean well and don’t understand the damage they are doing. But most of the management of the AMA, pharmaceutical companies, and FDA are in bed with one another and lobby to keep people from true medical freedom. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Honestly, I am just a researcher and everything presented in this book is just my opinion based on research. The rest of this book is dedicated to the study and treatment of most digestive disorders for the average person. I suggest you also work with a trustworthy doctor, PA, Nurse Practitioner, Nutritionist, Naturopath or Chiropractor that can help you get on a path of better health. </span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">SIBO is a medical condition where a person has too many bad bacteria in their small intestine. This is usually caused by both a poor American diet and long term use of a PPI drug (Proton Pump Inhibitor). Long term use of PPI’s causes bacteria that would normally be eliminated by stomach acid, to survive and flourish in the small intestine. Also the American diet of fermenting carbohydrates causes the bacteria to thrive and produce lots of excess gas. The lack of stomach acid also causes food proteins to be partially undigested which causes allergies to develop and this causes even more gas to build up. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">The bacteria also make protective biofilms (one of the most common examples of a biofilm is the “film” found on your teeth when you don’t brush for awhile) which make eradication with antibiotics very difficult. <span style=""""> </span>The biofilm protect the bacteria from antibiotic treatment, bactericides, and probiotics. To destroy the opportunistic bacteria you have to also destroy the biofilm that it is hiding behind. This can be obtained by either breaking down the biofilm itself using systemic enzymes or by chelating the Iron out of the biofilm to break it up by using either Calcium Disodium EDTA or NAC.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">The main symptoms of SIBO are indigestion, lots of gas, and horrible smelling deification, burps, and flatulence. Most people with IBS are walking around with SIBO as their main cause of their problems. Other symptoms of SIBO include abdominal pains, constipation and/or diarrhea, food allergies, and low grade fever. One of the biggest correlations between a condition and a disease are Rosacea and SIBO. In one major study 96% of Rosacea patients were in remission or cured for at least 9 months after taking Rifaxmin to treat their SIBO.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">A hydrogen breath test is used to diagnose SIBO. It is a non-invasive fasting test done in which a doctor has you breathe into a machine that monitors the excess hydrogen or methane that is released by the extra opportunistic bacteria in your small intestine. You are either given glucose, dextrose, or lactulose and results are collected at twenty minute intervals for at least 3-5 hours. If you produce at least 20 ppm of hydrogen or methane then you are positive for sibo (but even a result of 12 ppm should be treated at the very minimum). Lactulose is the best to use because it isn’t absorbed by the intestinal tract itself. Glucose is easily absorbed by both the bacteria and the intestines. This means it can give a false reading because at least 17 ft of the small intestine will not be tested because of the quick glucose absorption. </span></p>

The more opportunistic bacteria in your small intestine, the more food they consume which can lead to nutrient deficiency of B 12 and Iron, which then leads to the patient developing anemia. The bacteria also consume more nutrients that are now unabsorbed by the gut which leads to both more bacteria and gas production. This leads to abdominal bloating, pain, and flatulence. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">The bacteria then start to decrease fat absorption which leads to stool problems with color / fat content and this also leads to deficiencies in vitamins A and D.

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Bacteria then enter the bloodstream from the loss of integrity in the intestinal wall and start an immune reaction that causes fatigue, systemic pain, and elevated liver enzymes. Finally, the bacteria start to excrete acids that cause neurological and cognitive problems like brain fog and memory problems. The cycle then continues as the body’s Immune system tries to kill of the opportunistic bacteria which at the same time poison the body with acids and toxins. The vicious cycle then repeats itself in the patient, who becomes sick for a very long time.</span></p>

I have worked for a vitamin company for over 3 years, and I am currently going to school to get a degree in Biology. I have also been a practicing naturopath for the past 5 years. All of this changed for me on June 24, 2011, when my youngest son was diagnosed with CMEMS. CMEMS is an extremely rare genetical disorder (only five children have been diagnosed in the world with it other than him).
I dedicated my life to take care of my son, and in my spare time I write. I am now working on a book that I think that can help people suffering from digestive problems. I need to raise money to set up a website, hire a graphic artist, and hire a formatter as well.
This book is my life and a collection of all my work. I understand the struggle that people have when they are suffering from digestion problems. I have, myself suffered from LERD, for three years and have successfully treated myself. 

A basic overview of my book, the topics in my book will include:
How the Digestive System Works
Herbal and Nutritional Supplement Listing and Information
Antibiotic Guide and Medicines Used to Treat Digestive Conditions
Tips to Improve Digestive Health
Standard Diagnostic Procedures and Information
Probiotic Guide and Information (All The Different Types and Uses)
Supplement Brand Recommendations
Protocols for Most Digestive Diseases (GERD, LERD, SIBO, Gastirits, Gastroparesis, IBS, IBD, Esophageal Motility Disorders)
Protocols for Colon Cleansing and Parasite Elimination
Protocols for Constipation, Diarrhea and food poisoning 
Protocol to treat Candida, H. Pylori, and C. Diff Infections
Information on Diets
Gastrointestinal Cancer General Information and Alternative Treatments

The opening to my book:
There is an average of seventy million American’s diagnosed with digestive disorders every year. More Americans are rushing to their doctors to treat conditions like heartburn, gas, GERD, SIBO, IBS, ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease. More digestive diseases and problems are also being discovered every day. The most concerning aspect of all these conditions is that science and natural medicine are way ahead of the curve in treating all of these problems. Even though this is true most people only rely on conventional medicine. Conventional medicine is great for emergency procedures and life threatening conditions, but has a horrible tract record for treating preventable conditions and diseases.
Examples of Mainstream Medicine Being Wrong About Digestive Issues
1.     Ulcers were only caused by stress and too much stomach acid. Scientists discovered in the 1980’s that H. Pylori was the main cause of stomach ulcers. Mainstream medicine didn’t accept this fact until the mid 1990’s. Millions of Americans were mistreated with antacids, H2 antagonists, and PPI’s. H. Pylori as the main cause of ulcers was never addressed during this time and may patients suffered.
2.    Another common misconception is that the only cause of Heartburn is excess acid in the stomach.  Since most people have a basic understanding of physics (that doctors seem not to grasp), stomach acid can't travel up the esophagus by itself because of gravity. Also the LES prevents stomach contents from leaving the stomach as much as possible (this would explain why stomach acid doesn’t come up when you lay down or are upside down). Excess stomach acid cannot be the sole reason for GERD. GERD can be caused by too little stomach acid, which over time causes gas buildup in the stomach and small intestine. GERD can also be caused by a weakened LES from gas pressure, Hiatal Hernia putting pressure on the stomach and LES, SIBO, and Lack of Digestive Enzymes leading to increased gas and food allergies.
3.     Ulcerative Colitis and Crohns Disease sufferers are also having the same problem today, since science has already proved that these diseases are caused by the Mycobacterium Avium. The main source of Mycobacerium Avium in humans is improperly pasteurized milk. Mainstream medicine still treats these conditions as only autoimmune disorders sadly.
All of these can be treated with simple supplementation and lifestyle changes. Mainstream medicine will only offer medicine for the rest of one's life as an answer to these medical problems. One of the proposed reasons why the actual cause of these diseases isn’t addressed properly is because the huge amount of money that can be made if a patient is on the drug for the rest of their life. 
Most doctors, pharmacists, chemists, mean well and don’t understand the damage they are doing. But most of the management of the AMA, pharmaceutical companies, and FDA are in bed with one another and lobby to keep people from true medical freedom. 
Honestly, I am just a researcher and everything presented in this book is just my opinion based on research. The rest of this book is dedicated to the study and treatment of most digestive disorders for the average person. I suggest you also work with a trustworthy doctor, PA, Nurse Practitioner, Nutritionist, Naturopath or Chiropractor that can help you get on a path of better health. 
Sample Protocol


SIBO / Leaky Gut Syndrome
 
SIBO is a medical condition where a person has too many bad bacteria in their small intestine. This is usually caused by both a poor American diet and long term use of a PPI drug (Proton Pump Inhibitor). Long term use of PPI’s causes bacteria that would normally be eliminated by stomach acid, to survive and flourish in the small intestine. Also the American diet of fermenting carbohydrates causes the bacteria to thrive and produce lots of excess gas. The lack of stomach acid also causes food proteins to be partially undigested which causes allergies to develop and this causes even more gas to build up. 
The bacteria also make protective biofilms (one of the most common examples of a biofilm is the “film” found on your teeth when you don’t brush for awhile) which make eradication with antibiotics very difficult.  The biofilm protect the bacteria from antibiotic treatment, bactericides, and probiotics. To destroy the opportunistic bacteria you have to also destroy the biofilm that it is hiding behind. This can be obtained by either breaking down the biofilm itself using systemic enzymes or by chelating the Iron out of the biofilm to break it up by using either Calcium Disodium EDTA or NAC.
The main symptoms of SIBO are indigestion, lots of gas, and horrible smelling deification, burps, and flatulence. Most people with IBS are walking around with SIBO as their main cause of their problems. Other symptoms of SIBO include abdominal pains, constipation and/or diarrhea, food allergies, and low grade fever. One of the biggest correlations between a condition and a disease are Rosacea and SIBO. In one major study 96% of Rosacea patients were in remission or cured for at least 9 months after taking Rifaxmin to treat their SIBO.
A hydrogen breath test is used to diagnose SIBO.

Are Opportunistic Bacteria The Main Cause of Leaky Gut?
The excess bacteria in the small intestine can wreck havoc with your health and lead you digestion into a vicious cycle.

<h3>The Story<br/>
</h3>Hello, my name is Kevin Clifford. I recently returned from Japan where I had been teaching English to the local children. While there, I experienced a wonderful and unique culture. One major event that I loved was experiencing New Years with thousands of people at Tokyo Tower and seeing thousands of hope balloons launch into the air at once. Unfortunately, because of the frequent earthquakes, continued threats of tsunamis and nuclear meltdowns that were escalating in Japan, I was forced to return to the United States on short notice and on very limited funding.  I returned home with less than $200 to get my life started again. Shortly after coming back to Reno, Nevada, I was attempting to find a new job (that would supplement my photography) when I hurt myself.  Little did I know, a groin (Inguinal) hernia had been forming for quite some time before becoming enlarged and quite painful. <br/><br/>Many people can deal with hernias for many years before surgery. However, some people need surgery sooner rather than later. A hernia can be a medical emergency if it gets too big, which can cut the circulation off in the area. If I were to get a job with benefits ASAP, I would have to wait at least 3 months before being covered on insurance. However the job market is less than stellar and with more jobs shedding benefits, I feel it would be difficult to get the surgery within a year.  <br/><br/>Photography is my passion and I have done a several outlandish things to get ""the shot,"" which include going into a wildfire with a fire crew and photographing as an adult cheetah ran towards me while un-caged. But it's not only the amazing and wild things that I have gotten to do so far (and hopefully more in the future). It's the people that I got to share those experiences with. I have made many close friends across the globe while on my photo adventures. And when I mean close, I don't use that term lightly. I met my close friends though photography; either as photographers themselves, co-workers, subjects, assistants or a random person on the street. I love each and every one of them with everything I have and if it came down to it, I will sell every piece of photography gear that I own just to get fixed so I could spend one more day to hang out with them. The gear doesn't matter…the people do. <br/><br/>Even though I am willing to sell everything I own, I don't wish for it to come to that just yet. I communicate through photography as a painter communicates through his/her art. Hell, I think I communicate better with photography than speaking (which is one reason that I can be ""too honest"" ). Also, I love to be invited (and to invite people) on photo adventures and it helps to be able to do the same activity as the rest of my friends and without using all their gear. It's the small moments, such as going on photo shoots, coming up with new ideas, or just hanging out that I cherish deeply.<br/><br/>This hernia is holding me back from everything I enjoy: my friends, family, work and my hobbies. Further, I know that you could be donating to someone who has cancer, is homeless, etc, and someone with a hernia is often viewed as ""less deserving."" However, I would love to get this behind me so that I can bet back to ""normal"" . I can't offer too much, but my friends and I are willing to donate our time and beautiful photographs to you if you do wish to donate.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and please check out some of my friends' works at:<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.liquidinplastic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.liquidinplastic.com/</a><br/><a href=""http://www.vlemieuxphotography.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.vlemieuxphotography.com/</a><br/><a href=""http://www.bradhornphotography.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.bradhornphotography.com/</a><br/><a href=""http://archive.nevadaphotosource.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://archive.nevadaphotosource.com/</a><br/><a href=""http://fieldingfotography.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://fieldingfotography.com/</a><br/><br/>Also, the prints and services to the right will be offered as a ""Thank You"" for your donations.<br/><br/><p style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Ok so here goes nothing... the pic above is of my mom and myself...The reason I am posting is in hopes of being able tosave my mom's life and our home.  My mom had to have a tracheostomy on June 21st, 2012 and we were told at that point when she agreed to have the procedure that medicare would cover for the surgery and the acute rehab after she is transferred from the hospital.  However today we were informed by the hospital social worker that what she had informed of us the week before was not the case.  She told us that the acute care can cost between 35k and 50k a month.  The worst part is that she said that unless we had proof of funds and mom required the extended stay to heal that we would have to give up our home that we have had for over 38 years. </p>
<p>So a little back story on this wonderful person and why she needs any and all help that we can get.  My mom's name is Barbara Hill and she was born August 3, 1951.  At the age of 9 she ended up with polio.  She spent quite a few years in and out of hospitals and in a body cast for over a year as well as an iron lung.  She overcame this disease and grew to be a beautiful woman with a loving heart who gave birth to two girls.  My mom has been called mom by many people as she was always involved in all of our functions throughout school and she was also a girl scouts leader for many years.  This same amazing woman worked a full time and a part time job to help keep our family together and refused to give up on my sister or myself.  In July of 2005 she had to have major surgery on her neck to repair what was labeled as a swan neck which was the result of the surgeries that had been done to her as a child from the polio.</p>
<p>After mom's surgery in 2005 I stopped working and started to care for her as it became a mostly full time job that although unpaid i was ready and willing to do.  I figured heck she raised me and took care of me so it was time to return the favor.  Her doctors campaigned for her to have this surgery because while her lungs have weakened, her heart and mind and everything else is soo strong.  Everyone at the hospital said that it would be a complete and total shame for someone so strong willed with such a wonderful personality to not be able to continue to live life and she admitted to me herself that she didn't want to die.  She wasn't ready to die but she felt bad for me putting my life on hold for the past 7 years and she didn't want to be a burden to me.  I told her with tears in my eyes that she was never a burden to me and i wasn't ready to let her go if she was willing to fight to live!!!</p>
<p>So now I am at the point of willing to beg and plead with virtual strangers that if you love life and know what it means to love someone so dearly and not want such a strong force to pass on just yet... please please help in anyway that you can.  The current amounts needed arent as of yet set in stone but i do know that the generator that would have to be installed at the house will cost about 10,000 and the vent machine that she would be on at home is also about 10,000.  My main concern is the astronomical amount that they are telling me that the acute rehabilatation is going cost.</p>
<p>To those that can contribute a huge heartfelt thank you and the biggest virtual hug imaginable.  To those that arent able to contribute if it is possible for you to pass this on to others to get the word out wou;ld be amazingly wonderful and huge thanks and hugs to you as well!!!</p>

By using Twitter oAuth, the dashboard will be fully integrated with Twitter’s API, which also makes signing up even simpler.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Full-time scalable team</b></p>
<p>The new version of Tweet Rocket will be more accessible, more affordable and quicker to sign up. With this in mind, we expect an increase in new customers. As all campaigns are setup manually by our team, more customers will require a larger team to setup the new campaigns. Funding will help us do this. Our goal is to also decrease the setup time from 48 hours to within 24 hours, so customer campaigns are up and running even quicker.</p>

<b>Does Tweet Rocket support other social networks?</b>
<p></p>
<p>This is our long term vision for Tweet Rocket. At the moment, we think other tools do a pretty poor job of incorporating all social network management in a clean and simple way.

<p><b>Your website sucks...</b></p>
<p>Hey, that's not a question! But we'll address it anyway. Our current website was quickly thrown up as part of the proof of concept. It really is temporary until we get the time or funding to allow us to show off Tweet Rocket in all its glory. It's certainly in the works though.</p>

Featured on:



Tweet Rocket is a powerful social media service for organically growing your Twitter audience, with the backing of an expert social media team. This is it, in a nutshell:






What makes it different from any other social media tool, is that there is a real, human team of digital marketing experts who set up your campaign to work effectively no matter what industry you’re in.
Working prototype
In November 2014 we built an internal prototype of Tweet Rocket and launched it to the public as a proof of concept.Worldwide signupsSo far we’ve had customers sign up in over 6 countries, including:Our customer base spans across over 12 sectors, including:What people are saying:Developed at the Sussex Innovation Centre at the University of SussexTweet Rocket is being developed in Brighton; the 'silicon valley' of the UK. At the heart of it is The Sussex Innovation Centre, where we're based. Mike Herd is the executive director here and he shares his thoughts on Tweet Rocket so far...






We use basic information about your business when you sign up and immediately begin building your campaign. Upon going live, Tweet Rocket completely takes care of the following activities:

We always play nice with Twitter. So our team manually take care of:

...and of course:






We do deep research into your brand and industry niche, to ensure that we’re tweeting relevant and engaging content to your followers. We use feeds from around the web and create some of our own, so that we can tweet out the following types of content to your customers:





Automatically inserts relevant hashtags
Tweet Rocket automatically finds and replaces keywords with popular hashtags as well as adds relevant hashtags to the end of your tweets for maximum exposure and more growth.




After only a few months, we’re seeing excellent growth across all of our campaigns. The rate of growth varies depending on your industry.
Here are just some examples:

















Clean and simple to use
We've made Tweet Rocket super clear and user-friendly unlike most other tools available. We designed the dashboard in a way that is easy enough for 'our parents' to use, yet advanced enough that us as a digital marketing agency can take full advantage of its capabilities.




Your own Tweet Rocket assistant
Tweet Rocket doesn't let you fend for yourself. So to make things even simpler, we're giving you your very own social media assistant, who will provide you with tips and assistance on anything that will help improve your account. 


Advanced feed finder

Our advanced feed finder lets you enter some basic keywords around your niche, which then automatically finds you high authority and powerful feeds that produce great content for your Twitter account and your followers.

Built for resellers

We've built Tweet Rocket with resellers in mind. Our customers are already reselling Tweet Rocket to their clients with a healthy markup and they've given us invaluable feedback on how Tweet Rocket should allow them to effectively manage their clients.






Customers are already reselling



Manage your account from anywhere

Tweet Rocket looks and feels great on every device. Monitor your campaign growth or make changes to your campaign on the go at any time.


Tweet Rocket Score - A measure of quality
As part of the beta, we have developed our own algorithm which scores all Twitter users on the quality of their account. To help score users, we look at factors like tweet activity, age of account, following/followers ratio and much more.
We use this score to suggest users to follow and unfollow, which we recommend to do on a daily basis. On certain packages, our team will do this for you, meaning you can take an entirely hands-off approach to your campaign if you wish.

Campaign timeline

We strive to deploy your campaign within 24-48 hours from sign up. Below is what a typical campaign timeline looks like:









We are Wonderlabs, a small digital marketing agency in Brighton (UK) and we’ve taken everything we’ve learnt over the past 8 years and created Tweet Rocket.



We’re using our wealth of experience of delivering successful marketing campaigns to our clients and packaged it up into a hybrid service to empower businesses all over the world to take advantage of social media no matter what their capabilities are, what their budget is or how much time they have.

The people behind the magic






Tweet Rocket is for anyone looking to grow their audience on Twitter without the time or knowhow to tweet interesting and engaging content to their existing followers. We’re making Tweet Rocket competitive and affordable for businesses of all sizes and hobbyists alike.

We recommend Tweet Rocket if you are a:










Right now, Tweet Rocket is still a side project as we still have existing clients whose digital marketing campaigns we manage. Getting funding would allow us to realise our dream and make the transition from a digital marketing agency helping dozens of businesses, to full-time Tweet Rocketeers, helping millions.Design and development for customer dashboard (with oAuth)
Funding will pay for design, development and testing costs for our most requested feature: a customer-facing, powerful dashboard. One that would give customers complete flexibility and control over their campaigns. By using Twitter oAuth, the dashboard will be fully integrated with Twitter’s API, which also makes signing up even simpler.

Full-time scalable team
The new version of Tweet Rocket will be more accessible, more affordable and quicker to sign up. With this in mind, we expect an increase in new customers. As all campaigns are setup manually by our team, more customers will require a larger team to setup the new campaigns. Funding will help us do this. Our goal is to also decrease the setup time from 48 hours to within 24 hours, so customer campaigns are up and running even quicker.
Improved infrastructure
Tweet Rocket currently runs across 4 local servers and is expensive to scale. We also have to pause campaigns in order to make adjustments to them. Funding would allow for scalable, secure and stable cloud hosting, making the platform more sustainable and wiping out any campaign downtime.
First-class customer support
Most of our time is spent carrying out our day to day work, whilst trying to set up new campaigns and maintain high levels of customer support for Tweet Rocket customers. Super difficult with multiple time zones!
With funding, we would be able to significantly reduce customer support time, whilst increasing customer satisfaction. We’ll be integrating systems like Intercom to ensure that feedback and support is always on hand, right within the dashboard.



We'll have a special beta version of Tweet Rocket for backers to use in June 2015. We'll get feedback from you and implement changes and suggestions and follow up with a full public release in late Summer 2015. All backers will get early access ahead of a public release.







We're giving away some great perks for you to enjoy when you contribute, including huge savings on Tweet Rocket subscriptions.
On the top perk, we're reserving 5 spots in our super secret global marketing campaign, where we're producing something really innovative to get the word of the rocket out there. We'd love to have you on board the Tweet Rocket.

L'Académie de Basketball BSA


L’Académie Réussite est un organisme à but non lucratif (OBNL) qui a été fondé par des passionnés de sport, des sciences et de l’entrepreneuriat, dont Frédéric Roy-Gobeil, son président, qui est un ancien joueur élite, entraîneur et entrepreneur.

Le premier projet de l’organisme comprendra la création d’une académie de basketball (BSA) qui aura comme objectif de promouvoir la persévérance scolaire par la pratique du sport élite.  Le sport est un motivateur bien connu pour aider les jeunes à se dépasser et à viser l’excellence.  Leur succès dans le sport permet aussi de briser le cycle de l’échec par la valorisation de l’école en tant que défi, tout en assurant l’adoption de saines habitudes de vie au quotidien.  Pourquoi le basketball?

Nous organiserons différentes activités de financement, dont cette campagne IndieGogo qui représente votre plus simple façon de nous aider! Votre contribution servira à couvrir une partie ou la totalité des frais d'inscription d'un jeune au camp. 
Évidemment, votre principal bénéfice sera d’avoir contribué à enrichir l’été d’un jeune joueur en l’aidant à participer au camp de ses rêves!



D'autres façons d'aider
Si vous ne pouvez pas nous aider avec un don, vous pouvez toujours faire une différence en partageant notre page avec les gens de votre entourage et en passant le mot autour de vous!
Merci de votre confiance. Toute l’équipe de l’Académie ainsi que nos jeunes vous remercient d’avance.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Summary </b></p>
<br/><br/>
<p><b>A goal</b><span> </span> : put my skills at the service of young children diagnosed with
Cancer and </p>
<p>rare illnesses through a communication office which will be dedicated to
them. </p>
<p><b>A Challenge</b> : run 500 kms from Paris to London in 10 days, at a rate
of 1 Ultra Marathon of 50kms per day. </p>
<p>The Paris – London running challenge was first born from a desire to change
a life : my own. I was a communication consultant and I decided to make a fresh start on a
professional, personal , physical and spiritual level...hit the road, run and
find myself. </p>
<p>Whilst preparing for this challenge, I have been fortunate to meet with
people who were going to change my life and help me through this journey. </p>
<p>After meeting with organisations dedicated to ill children, I have realised
what they </p>
<p>needed and how difficult it was for them to fight against rare illnesses .
That’s when I came to the realisation that my new life had to be a part of
theirs and vice versa. </p>
<p><b>The Paris –
London Challenge had just found its goal</b> : </p>
<p>Raise enough funds to open an office dedicated to organisations that look
after ill </p>
<p>children and which are involved with the medical research. </p>
<p>That office will be made at the disposal of these organisations on a
voluntary basis, </p>
<p>It will enable them to communicate with a broader audience, organise events
and establish a network with different structures on the European arena. </p>
<p>1 child out of 440 develops a cancer before the age of 15...these organisations
fight </p>
<p>every day to push the research forward. </p>
<p>To offer them a communication office on a full time basis will help bring
an awareness of their actions and initiatives towards other companies and communicate their need
to political entities; a larger awareness to a larger audience. </p>
<p>If I can, with this office, help them build a better world, where there is
hope for these children,...... our children...then my new life would have found its purpose. </p>
<p><b>WHAT I NEED</b> : </p>
<p>£ 10.000 </p>
<p>. This money will help to set up the office and will provide a smooth run
of operations during the first months of its activity. It will also give us time to get
in touch with companies and get them on board to participate and fund the communication of the organisations through common events. </p>
<p><b>THE IMPACT </b></p>
<p>.The funds will allow us to pay for charges and expenses : </p>
<p>.office, rent, furniture… </p>
<p>The funds will enable the office to start working for the organisations
straight after the run. Big European meetings are taking place this year and the following one,
on </p>
<p>research for rare diseases and paediatric cancers : these organisations
need help to </p>
<p>prepare their communication and get a broad audience’s attention and help. </p>
<p><b>Challenges :</b></p>
<p>Once the office is open, the biggest challenge will be to find companies that
are ready to host events for these organisations and allow the office to keep working on a
voluntary basis. </p>
<p>But my experience and skills in communication will make a difference !

L'impact

Les fonds récoltés permettront de payer les frais matériels :
Ouverture de l'agence, loyers, fournitures de base
Les dons permettront d'offrir ce service précieux aux associations dès la fin de la course. De grandes rencontres Européennes ont lieu cette année et en 2017 sur la recherche des maladies orphelines et cancers pédiatriques, ces associations ont besoin de preparer leur Communication afin d'avoir le soutien du grand public  



Risques et défis
Une fois l'agence ouverte le plus grand défi sera de trouver des entreprises prêtes à partager des évènements avec ces associations afin de permettre à l'agence de continuer à fonctionner sur la base du bénévolat 
Mais mon expérience et mes compétences en communication évènementielle feront la différence !

Summary 

A goal  : put my skills at the service of young children diagnosed with
Cancer and 
rare illnesses through a communication office which will be dedicated to
them. 
A Challenge : run 500 kms from Paris to London in 10 days, at a rate
of 1 Ultra Marathon of 50kms per day. 
The Paris – London running challenge was first born from a desire to change
a life : my own. I was a communication consultant and I decided to make a fresh start on a
professional, personal , physical and spiritual level...hit the road, run and
find myself. 
Whilst preparing for this challenge, I have been fortunate to meet with
people who were going to change my life and help me through this journey. 
After meeting with organisations dedicated to ill children, I have realised
what they 
needed and how difficult it was for them to fight against rare illnesses .
That’s when I came to the realisation that my new life had to be a part of
theirs and vice versa. 
The Paris –
London Challenge had just found its goal : 
Raise enough funds to open an office dedicated to organisations that look
after ill 
children and which are involved with the medical research. 
That office will be made at the disposal of these organisations on a
voluntary basis, 
It will enable them to communicate with a broader audience, organise events
and establish a network with different structures on the European arena. 
1 child out of 440 develops a cancer before the age of 15...these organisations
fight 
every day to push the research forward. 
To offer them a communication office on a full time basis will help bring
an awareness of their actions and initiatives towards other companies and communicate their need
to political entities; a larger awareness to a larger audience. 
If I can, with this office, help them build a better world, where there is
hope for these children,...... our children...then my new life would have found its purpose. 
WHAT I NEED : 
£ 10.000 
. This money will help to set up the office and will provide a smooth run
of operations during the first months of its activity. It will also give us time to get
in touch with companies and get them on board to participate and fund the communication of the organisations through common events. 
THE IMPACT 
.The funds will allow us to pay for charges and expenses : 
.office, rent, furniture… 
The funds will enable the office to start working for the organisations
straight after the run. Big European meetings are taking place this year and the following one,
on 
research for rare diseases and paediatric cancers : these organisations
need help to 
prepare their communication and get a broad audience’s attention and help. 
Challenges :
Once the office is open, the biggest challenge will be to find companies that
are ready to host events for these organisations and allow the office to keep working on a
voluntary basis. 
But my experience and skills in communication will make a difference !",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<strong>
</strong><strong> A </strong>funny<strong> thing happened during our 5 year battle with cancer, we learned about healthy living.</strong><br/><p>Jan and Joe want to share how to live healthier but we need your help to do it. We promise to deliver the MOST important thing we learned. Read on to find out what it is. <br/></p>
<h3><b>OUR MISSION</b></h3>
<p>We are dedicated to help everyone to understand that ""Few things have as powerful an effect on your health and the health of your family as the FOOD YOU EAT and the ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY of your home.” You CAN and MUST control these factors with our help. We will provide science-based education and nutritional information and quality proven affordable products and services for you and your home which will provide the building blocks of good health.</p>
<p>Introducing LIVE HEALTHY INTL a purpose-driven company offering unique products for healthy living and healthy homes <br/><br/></p>
<h3><b>OUR STORY</b></h3>
<p>Why do we care? We're driven by our founders desire to empower people to live full and healthy lives. While enduring more than 400 hours of chemotherapy in just 40 months, Joe and his caregiver wife of 47 years Jan took a deep dive into cancer care and immune system rebuilding literature. They were determined to find ways to stay strong, recover and strengthen Joe's immune system. After three bouts with his cancer in four years they did, and they learned a few things along the way. Now they are <b>devoted to helping others get and stay healthy, whether they're fighting an  illness, or just trying to improve their quality of life.</b></p>
<p>We are launching Live Healthy Intl to help make good health achieveable for everyone.  We will give 10 percent of all our profits to needy health and wellness organizations.  We are also developing our “Supplement Assistance Program” that will make our products widely available. In addition, our website will become a primary resource for timely information on nutrition, wellness, disease prevention, and the science of good health.<br/><br/><b>Essential Nutrition</b><br/>Our first product offering, Live Healthy Intl Parent Essential Oil PEOs, provide a missing piece in American nutrition: An organic, plant-based source of Omega-6 and Omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFAs), arguably one of the most important pair of nutrients in the human diet.</p>
<p>PEOs truly are essential nutrients. Decades of research has shown that scientifically balanced Omega-6 and 3 have a decisive importance in nutrition, supporting wellness throughout the life-cycle, from the development of the brain in infancy to life-long cardiovascular health.</p>
<p><b>PEOs are the body’s oxygen magnets, making every cell membrane a splendid conductor of oxygen. They draw it from our bloodstream into our cellular engines where it powers all the functions that keep us healthy and fit for life, FORTIFYING OPTIMAL HEALTH.</b><br/><br/><b>Typically omega 3 has been obtained from fish oil.</b></p>

""There is no medical evidence to say fish oils that are sold over the counter actually do what the claim"". Is how The Bulletin, a publication that serves the people of Oregon, summarized in a March 27, 2014 article.

<p>4. The New York Times dated March 30,2015  <br/>“FISH OIL CLAIMS NOT SUPPORTED by RESEARCH” <br/>The vast majority of clinical trials involving fish oil have found NO EVIDENCE that it lowers the risk of heart attack and stroke. Dr Andrew Grey an associate professor of medicine at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and the author of a 2014 study on fish oil in JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE says, “ There is a major disconnect, THE SALES ARE GOING UP DESPITE THE PROGRESSIVE ACCUMULATION OF TRIALS THAT SHOW NO EFFECT.”</p>
<p>In the same NY Times article Dr Gianni Tognoni of the institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan states, “I THINK THE ERA OF FISH OIL AS MEDICATION COULD BE CONSIDERED OVER NOW.”</p>
<p>These are just a few of the growing number of experts we chose to introduce you to the current direction of studies that shows the ineffectiveness of fish oil.</p>
<p>We need to ask ourselves why fish oils are not working. The major problem comes from the way it is processed.</p>

<b>FACTS ABOUT PROCESSING FISH OILS</b><br/><p>Fish have no glands so creating fish oil supplements basically means you get “JUICED” fish. Juiced fish is the worst way to get your EFAs – only one reason our PEO EFAs are plant-based containing no fish oils.</p>
<p>Another reason is a lot of fish contain toxins, like mercury from where they live. That is why most fish oil is ADULTERATED meaning a high heat processing of ground up whole fish and treating with chemicals to get the toxins out.  </p>
<p>Fish oil is also a derivative form of EPA and DHA not the PARENT ESSENTIAL OIL form L.A. and A.L.A. that nature intended for us. Fish oil and Krill oil are animal-derived and contain cholesterol while our cold-pressed, plant derived PARENT EFAs contain no cholesterol at all.</p>
<p>WHY WOULD YOU TAKE FISH OIL WHEN THE NEXT GENERATION OF PLANT SEED BASED PARENT ESSENTIAL OIL EFAS ARE NOW AVAILABLE?</p>

<br/><b>PARENT ESSENTIAL OIL – THE SOLUTION</b><br/><p>Professor Brian Peskin Founder of Life-Systems Engineering Science is the creator of our patented PEOs. During his extensive research he came upon the work of Dr Otto Warburg MD., PH.D. a German Scientist in the 1930's. Dr. Warburg discovered that the degeneration of oxygen in the cells was a hidden cause of cancer. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931 for his work. This lead to Prof. Peskin discovery that the cause of many other health problems like heart disease and diabetes is due to the lack of oxygen in cells. </p>
<p>The last eight years PEOs have been marketed almost exclusively through Medical Doctors and now Live Healthy Intl is making them available to everyone. Please take the time to watch Prof. Peskin's 13 minute video which will explain what they are and how they work in your body.</p>

</div><p></p><h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</h3><p>Take a deep breath. Imagine how you would feel if every cell in your body was getting an optimal supply of oxygen. Doctors overwhelmingly believe that oxygen-rich cells are the key to good health, and many recommend PEOs for their therapeutic effect on heart disease, diabetes, auto-immune disorders, cancer and arthritis.</p><p>Unfortunately few people even know about PEOs. </p><p>Our market research  confirmed retail stores lacked the information available to consumers and how difficult the dissemination of facts is . Therefore rather than develope the expertise to navigate the supply chain, Live Healthy Intl decided to offer our PEOs and Live Healthy information direct to our customers.</p><p><b>Your contribution will enable us to:</b><br/></p><ol>
<li>Expand our website, making it more accessible, user-friendly and information rich.  </li>
<li>Add Liquid PEOs for those who can't swallow capsules and for our vegan friends.<br/>

<li>Launch our Supplement Assistance Program so everyone can have access to benefits of PEOs.</li>

After his latest round of chemo in April of 2014 he and Jan started discussions on how to help others get and stay healthy. All the sick people they encountered during his 5 year battle in Doctors offices, blood draw and infusion centers, hospitals and support group meetings both cancer and caregiver related inspired them. They wanted to share the benefits of the science-based nutrition they discovered in helping Joe handle the treatments and help rebuild his immune system to hopefully have a longer remission.  They wanted to find and provide affordable products and services that support good individual health and healthy homes. Joe is our President.</p><p><br/><b>Jan LoBiondo</b> is a wife, mother of 5, grandmother of 10, great-grandmother of 2. She has owned and operated a custom made children's clothing store and a custom made drapery business and has also worked in retail for 23 years including managing an Eddie Bauer store for 8 years. She is very active in the community by helping with soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and leads with a friend  a baby quilt making group for at risk mothers with babies. This more than qualifies her to be our CUSTOMER CARE OFFICER a new position for purpose-driven companies. Her goal is to make sure every decision of LHI considers the customer needs, wants and desires.</p><p><br/><b>Jim Hosley</b> has had an extraordinarily influential career in business development, management, helping entrepreneurs and individuals. He has worked with start ups and established companies guiding them to achieve their goals and make positive contributions to the world. He earned his Executive MBA in International Business at INSTEAD in Fontainbleu, France, and has served numerous public interest organizations, most recently The Center for Excellence in Education. At LHI Jim sets the companies course aligning goals and operations with his vision of a world in which business creates a wide spectrum of economic, social and environmental value. Jim is our VP of Operations.</p><p><br/><b>Jon LoBiondo</b> was a health and physical education teacher and now is an assistant Principal in our public schools. He is or has been a husband, father, state champion wrestler, life-long surfer and coach. Jon teaches and embodies the values of LHI which is science-based nutrition which has powered his athletic endeavors. Recently he successfully completed a grueling Spartan endurance race at Ft Collins, Colorado and he is training for another Spartan race twice as long. He has served on the board, which included a short stint as President, of the Delaware Association of Health, Physical Education and Dance (DAPHERD) which will help him to lead LHI efforts to communicate the benefits of sound nutrition.

A lot of the healthy properties are lost in the process.</i><br/><br/>Q: Why wouldn't the health food stores try your product?<br/><i>Retailers will when there is demand as they have significant shelf space invested in fish oil products that up until now have required little effort other than to make inventory available.</i><br/><br/>Q: Do you really believe you can gain traction by only selling direct to the consumer?<br/><i>Yes we do, but it will be a slow process until information is widely distributed to consumers.

These are just a few of the growing number of experts we chose to introduce you to the current direction of studies that shows the ineffectiveness of fish oil.
We need to ask ourselves why fish oils are not working. The major problem comes from the way it is processed.


FACTS ABOUT PROCESSING FISH OILSFish have no glands so creating fish oil supplements basically means you get “JUICED” fish. Juiced fish is the worst way to get your EFAs – only one reason our PEO EFAs are plant-based containing no fish oils.
Another reason is a lot of fish contain toxins, like mercury from where they live. That is why most fish oil is ADULTERATED meaning a high heat processing of ground up whole fish and treating with chemicals to get the toxins out.  
Fish oil is also a derivative form of EPA and DHA not the PARENT ESSENTIAL OIL form L.A. and A.L.A. that nature intended for us. Fish oil and Krill oil are animal-derived and contain cholesterol while our cold-pressed, plant derived PARENT EFAs contain no cholesterol at all.
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE FISH OIL WHEN THE NEXT GENERATION OF PLANT SEED BASED PARENT ESSENTIAL OIL EFAS ARE NOW AVAILABLE?

PARENT ESSENTIAL OIL – THE SOLUTIONProfessor Brian Peskin Founder of Life-Systems Engineering Science is the creator of our patented PEOs. During his extensive research he came upon the work of Dr Otto Warburg MD., PH.D. a German Scientist in the 1930's. Dr. Warburg discovered that the degeneration of oxygen in the cells was a hidden cause of cancer. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931 for his work. This lead to Prof. Peskin discovery that the cause of many other health problems like heart disease and diabetes is due to the lack of oxygen in cells. 
The last eight years PEOs have been marketed almost exclusively through Medical Doctors and now Live Healthy Intl is making them available to everyone. Please take the time to watch Prof. Peskin's 13 minute video which will explain what they are and how they work in your body.

Prof. Peskin talks about Arterial Compliance improvement by using the PEO Formulation. It is fully explained by Prof. Brian S. Peskin with David Sim, MD, Interventional Cardiologist in:
Proof of Concept in HumansInvestigating Oils With respect to Arterial flexibility (photoplethysmography) 
IOWA Study ResultsRemarkable experimental results of arterial  compliance improvement with PEO formulation   You will find the complete 8 page study with 27 scientific references at www.livehealthyintl.com   HERE ARE THE BENEFITS BY TAKING HLI PEOs




WHY WE NEED YOUR HELPTake a deep breath. Imagine how you would feel if every cell in your body was getting an optimal supply of oxygen. Doctors overwhelmingly believe that oxygen-rich cells are the key to good health, and many recommend PEOs for their therapeutic effect on heart disease, diabetes, auto-immune disorders, cancer and arthritis.Unfortunately few people even know about PEOs. Our market research  confirmed retail stores lacked the information available to consumers and how difficult the dissemination of facts is . Therefore rather than develope the expertise to navigate the supply chain, Live Healthy Intl decided to offer our PEOs and Live Healthy information direct to our customers.Your contribution will enable us to:

This is a $59.95 value.THE PRODUCTS WE ARE OFFERING WILL NOT BE SOLD IN STORES!FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS?Q: Isn't fish oil supposed to be good for you since doctors are recommending it? Unfortunately assumptions were made years ago about fish oil benefits but now real science is proving a lot of those benefits are not happening.Q: I thought fish oil is sustainable?No, not even Krill oil is sustainable, as all fish are being over harvested.Q: Are the PEOs sustainable?Absolutely as they are derived from Organic plant based seeds that are cold processed and natural.Q: What do you mean by Adulterated fish oil?It happens when the whole fish is ground up, cooked at high temperatures and treated with chemicals to get rid of the TOXINS. A lot of the healthy properties are lost in the process.Q: Why wouldn't the health food stores try your product?Retailers will when there is demand as they have significant shelf space invested in fish oil products that up until now have required little effort other than to make inventory available.Q: Do you really believe you can gain traction by only selling direct to the consumer?Yes we do, but it will be a slow process until information is widely distributed to consumers. Journalists and bloggers with large followings can really help us spread the word.THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR VALUABLE TIME.Jan and Joe  would like to ask for one more favor which is:If you like what you see, even if you are not in a position to contribute, PLEASE consider sharing this story with your family and friends through email and your social networks.

<p><b>My Story:</b></p>
<p>When I was in High School I got very sick and my western doctors could not figure out what was wrong.

There are so many homeless transgender teenagers who are misunderstood and living on the streets because of it and I want to offer them a place to feel comfortable and “at home”. If I can even make one person feel like they are special and not a “freak”, to offer a place that has no gender discrimination- or any type of discrimination at all- I would be so happy. Everyone deserves to feel special, to feel like they are accepted and have a firm footing in this world. No one should feel bad about the way they look, or dress, or identify sexually, about how many piercings or tattoos they have or however they chose to identify in this world.

Rent per square footage is extremely expensive ranging anywhere from $800/month for 300 square feet to $2000+ for larger spaces.- (10) treatment tables/recliner chairs which range from $100-500 per item-paying front desk staff to book appointments/greet patients/etc. -treatment supplies: sterile, single-use disposable needles ($30-50 per 1000 count box) moxa, essential oils (15-30/bottle), biohazard containers (5-10/bottle) and disposing of needles. -malpractice insurance ($1025 per year)-advertising and marketing in the local community and in newspapers, business cards, etc. ($ variable)- scheduling program to book patients and keep SOAP notes  (70$/month) -electricity to keep the lights on ($ variable)-small heaters to keep the treatment rooms nice and warm ($20-50 each)-small stereos to play relaxing music in the treatment rooms ($50-100) -sheets and blankets for covering the tables and keeping patients warm and cozy ($5-10 each)-office supplies- paper for health history forms-This funding will allow me to offer inexpensive treatments  (20-30$ range) to all who seek them.** I eventually want to offer a weekly day of free acupuncture treatments to homeless transgender youth. 
**If I do not reach my entire goal the funds will still go into the clinic and offering people inexpensive acupuncture treatments.  I am determined to open this clinic no matter what happens but any funding would help me get started and touch so many deserving people faster.
Other ways you can help:Even if you can't contribute with funding, please spread the word in your community and share my campaign! Any contributions help so much thank you!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Non-invasive and only requiring a few minutes per day, IRIS promotes breast elasticity, firmness and shape.IRIS provides red & IR light therapy through two flower shaped silicon pads. Based on scientifically proven cellular-level regeneration through bio-stimulation, IRIS helps slow down and even reverse the effect of aging on breasts.   IRIS stays in place with no adhesive. The soft pads are held in place by any bra, ensuring they never fall off. Soft and un-intrusive, the silicon pads feel like a soft cushion.        IRIS can fit around any breast size. With its flower-shape design, IRIS was created to cup perfectly around any pair of breasts providing even light treatment distribution. Wear IRIS while going about your daily activities.

Is IRIS Safe?The safety of light therapy has been certified and is already currently in use by numerous medical organizations in fields as diverse as wound healing, skin regeneration, hair growth and pain relief. Covered in soft silicone, LEDs are not directly in contact with skin and non-invasive IRIS does not penetrate the skin through heat energy but rather through light. Finally, the silicone body itself, which comes in contact with skin, is made of the same safe material as nipple shields used during breast feeding. 2. Can I use IRIS over 30 minutes?As with any change to the body, expecting drastic improvements should not be expected nor are they safe. We highly recommend that rather than undergoing prolonged therapy sessions, it is preferable to use IRIS diligently over an extended period of time. We do not recommend that IRIS be used for sessions longer than 10 to 30 minutes a day. 3. Does IRIS warm up during operation? If so, can you feel the warmth?Because IRIS emits energy through light, a certain amount of heat is produced, but always stays within range of the temperature of the human body. While IRIS may cause a slight rise in body temperature, it can mostly be attributed to the body’s biochemical reaction to the treatment rather than heat generated from the pads and is most often unnoticeable. 4. How long before I see enhancements to my breasts?While IRIS works for all women, the individual results will vary because the cause of ptosis varies by woman. Depending on the cause of ptosis, there will be differences in breast condition which alter the time frame for recovery. If used consistently over time, no matter the cause of ptosis, IRIS will provide rejuvenating results. 5. Can I exercise or move around with IRIS?Of course.

The Science of Puerto Rico! </b><br/>Most people don’t know that Puerto Rico used to be home to over 65% of the worlds pharmaceutical companies! Then, in the early 2000s, due to a change in tax policy, most of these companies were forced to leave Puerto Rico. What was left was incredible scientists, labs, and universities which is why you can use the 100% non-toxic products here today.<br/><br/><b style=""color: #A18CCE;font-weight: 800;margin-bottom:15px;"">2. Made in The USA! </b><br/>Some green cleaning companies manufacture in China. What that means is less ingredient oversight and a potential to have some really questionable ingredients in the products you use in your home and on your body. Cleancult is made here in beautiful New York and Vermont which gives us complete control of the entire supply chain and innovation.<br/><br/><b style=""color: #A18CCE;font-weight: 800;margin-bottom:15px;"">3. The Power of the Coconut</b><br/>Some of our products use a special version of coconut oil that is incredibly astringent and is not adopted by the big corporates because of the cost! We’ve teamed up with a small producer in Vermont that helps us deliver this ingredient that actually cleans dirt and grime while being non-toxic for you and your family.<br/><br/><b style=""color: #A18CCE;font-weight: 800;margin-bottom:15px;"">4. Natural Ingredients</b><br/>Many other cleaners on the market are made from petrochemicals which are derived from...oil. That means they are often not biodegradable and support some of the biggest polluters in the world! Our cleaners are made of natural and mineral ingredients which means a safer and better clean for you and the world.<br/><br/><b style=""color: #A18CCE;font-weight: 800;margin-bottom:15px;"">5. Delivered Whenever You Need</b><br/>Rather than having to shop at the store, your cleaning products will be delivered to you how you like, when you like! After the campaign is closed, your profile will automatically be added to our website, cleancult.com. From there, you can edit how frequent your orders will ship.<br/><br/><b style=""color: #A18CCE;font-weight: 800;margin-bottom:15px;"">6. Our Commitment to Puerto Rico</b><br/>By having our headquarters in the USA and donating 1 load of laundry detergent for every load that you buy, we’re committed to Puerto Rico and to help rebuild the island. So far, we have donated over <a href=""http://remezcla.com/culture/hurricane-maria-teen-raising-money/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">100,000 loads of laundry detergent</a>!<br/><br/><b style=""color: #A18CCE;font-weight: 800;margin-bottom:15px;"">7. No Waste! </b><br/>Today, over 53% of Americans drastically overdose their clothes and machines. This overdosing goes straight to our streams and right onto our skin. Now, on average, 3% of the weight of our clothes is leftover laundry detergent has yet to be washed out. Our single dose dishwashing and laundry pacs mean you don’t have to worry about overdosing.<br/><br/><b style=""color: #A18CCE;font-weight: 800;margin-bottom:15px;"">8. No More “Cleaning Graveyard”</b><br/>We choose not to sell gigantic tubs of our products to avoid the “cleaning graveyard” underneath your sink.

We moved to Puerto Rico and partnered with these incredible scientists, that aren't owned by the big chemical companies, and laboratories to create a proprietary formula that supercharges Coconut Oil into a whole new type of cleaner. It's harsher on tough stains like grease, blood, dirt, and wine.

Watch out dirt.<br/><br/><b style=""color: #2A53A2;font-weight: 800;margin-bottom:15px;"">Why We Started Cleancult</b><br/>When we started cleancult, we saw a problem. People we worked with, talked with, and interviewed thought they needed to compromise when they purchased responsibly made, “green” products. Current statistics claim that over, 90% of millennials want to go green, but that simply hasn’t happened. Green cleaning has grown half as fast as petroleum based cleaners (yuck!). We call this the “cleaning gap” and wanted to change it.<br/>Our goal is to close this “cleaning gap” and demonstrate to people that green cleaning can be mean! From our research, we know that this is part phycology and part chemistry and our goal is to solve them both. We set out to design cleaners that redefine green clean from the delivery to the packaging and all the way to the actual clean. We think we succeeded.<br/><br/><b style=""color: #2A53A2;font-weight: 800;margin-bottom:15px;"">Our Mission</b><br/>Our goal is to inspire and attract the next generation of responsible purchasing by designing responsible products and experiences with which you don’t have to compromise. We are not owned by a big corporation trying to “greenwash” but are instead trying to change the status quo. We believe that by basing ourselves in a strong community, listening to our customers, and trying to be leaders and not followers, we can use cleaners as a tool for change in your life... and in your bathroom;)</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529008971/xdsr1ags4dqb9wdmjjb9.png"" src=""""/></p><p><b style=""color: #DBAF81;font-weight: 800;margin-bottom:15px;"">Ryan Lupberger | CEO</b><br/>Ryan Lupberger has had a lifelong passion for building responsible brands and social movements.

Introducing cleancult, household green cleaning products designed to fix ineffective green cleaning brands, challenge oil-based chemical cleaners on the market today, and reinvent how we see “green”. Designed in Puerto Rico and made in the USA, cleancult is introducing green cleaners that actually clean. So, why green cleaners you might ask...well turns out, cleaning in the US is in a bad state! According to the NYT, ""Many Americans assume that the chemicals in their shampoos, detergents, and other consumer products have been thoroughly tested and proved to be safe. This assumption is Wrong"". Unlike Pharmaceuticals or pesticides, industrial chemicals DO NOT have to be tested before they are put on the market.The European Union and Canada have banned upward of 1,300 chemical ingredients in personal care products due to evidence of health hazards, but with its limited powers, the FDA has banned only 11 to date. With 53% of Americans overdoing their machine and an average 3% of the weight of your clothes coming from leftover laundry detergent, all of these chemicals are going into your clothes, on your skin, and into the environment!  People are starting to realize this reality, but there simply aren’t enough alternatives. According to Nielsen, 93% of millennials say want to switch to natural products and 71% even say that they’re willing to spend more for it but this simply hasn’t happened. The facts are that only 3% of the total cleaning market is natural green cleaners, but why you may ask …We set out to make cleancult different from other green cleaning brands. By supporting this campaign, you’re helping these 5 revolutionary cleaning products come to life. Each perk on the right contains a different cleaning plan that contains the below five products. Each product has been rigorously tested, experimentally innovated, and has been designed in Puerto Rico and made in the USA. By backing cleancult, you will receive each of the products above, delivered directly to your door. Need to pause the product shipment, no problem! You will have complete control to change dates, reorganize the product mix, and make it fit your schedule. After the campaign ends, you will be asked to register on cleancult.com and then can mix and match the products as you see fit. Cleancult was designed to close the cleaning gap between traditional green products and toxic conventional cleaners giving you true clean which actually works and smells great. So, we're making it super easy, and cheap to make this reality come true.  That’s why we, Puerto Ricans and Boulderites, combined to create green cleaners that actually work. So, do they actually work? Well, according to our many customer reviews, yes, they do!    1. The Science of Puerto Rico! Most people don’t know that Puerto Rico used to be home to over 65% of the worlds pharmaceutical companies! Then, in the early 2000s, due to a change in tax policy, most of these companies were forced to leave Puerto Rico. What was left was incredible scientists, labs, and universities which is why you can use the 100% non-toxic products here today.2. Made in The USA! Some green cleaning companies manufacture in China. What that means is less ingredient oversight and a potential to have some really questionable ingredients in the products you use in your home and on your body. Cleancult is made here in beautiful New York and Vermont which gives us complete control of the entire supply chain and innovation.3. The Power of the CoconutSome of our products use a special version of coconut oil that is incredibly astringent and is not adopted by the big corporates because of the cost! We’ve teamed up with a small producer in Vermont that helps us deliver this ingredient that actually cleans dirt and grime while being non-toxic for you and your family.4. Natural IngredientsMany other cleaners on the market are made from petrochemicals which are derived from...oil. That means they are often not biodegradable and support some of the biggest polluters in the world! Our cleaners are made of natural and mineral ingredients which means a safer and better clean for you and the world.5. Delivered Whenever You NeedRather than having to shop at the store, your cleaning products will be delivered to you how you like, when you like! After the campaign is closed, your profile will automatically be added to our website, cleancult.com. From there, you can edit how frequent your orders will ship.6. Our Commitment to Puerto RicoBy having our headquarters in the USA and donating 1 load of laundry detergent for every load that you buy, we’re committed to Puerto Rico and to help rebuild the island. So far, we have donated over 100,000 loads of laundry detergent!7. No Waste! Today, over 53% of Americans drastically overdose their clothes and machines. This overdosing goes straight to our streams and right onto our skin. Now, on average, 3% of the weight of our clothes is leftover laundry detergent has yet to be washed out. Our single dose dishwashing and laundry pacs mean you don’t have to worry about overdosing.8. No More “Cleaning Graveyard”We choose not to sell gigantic tubs of our products to avoid the “cleaning graveyard” underneath your sink. A right-sized cleaner will be delivered as often as you want, directly to your door. Say hooray to an actually clutter-free apartment and home! So, I get that it's awesome, but what's the science to it? Not many people know that Puerto Rico actually used to be home to 60% of the world's pharmaceutical companies. Until, changes in U.S policy forced most companies to leave the island in the early 2000's. This left behind a treasure trove of talented scientists, engineers, and top of the line laboratories. We moved to Puerto Rico and partnered with these incredible scientists, that aren't owned by the big chemical companies, and laboratories to create a proprietary formula that supercharges Coconut Oil into a whole new type of cleaner. It's harsher on tough stains like grease, blood, dirt, and wine. You know, all those super tough stains green cleaners won't even go near.By designing our products in Puerto Rico and partnering with a leading chemical engineering university, we are able to ensure innovation, quality, and safety by operating the entire supply chain. From working with surfactant molecules to mixing the soap in our apartment, we’ve done it all. That means we can finally make green...mean. Watch out dirt.Why We Started CleancultWhen we started cleancult, we saw a problem. People we worked with, talked with, and interviewed thought they needed to compromise when they purchased responsibly made, “green” products. Current statistics claim that over, 90% of millennials want to go green, but that simply hasn’t happened. Green cleaning has grown half as fast as petroleum based cleaners (yuck!). We call this the “cleaning gap” and wanted to change it.Our goal is to close this “cleaning gap” and demonstrate to people that green cleaning can be mean! From our research, we know that this is part phycology and part chemistry and our goal is to solve them both. We set out to design cleaners that redefine green clean from the delivery to the packaging and all the way to the actual clean. We think we succeeded.Our MissionOur goal is to inspire and attract the next generation of responsible purchasing by designing responsible products and experiences with which you don’t have to compromise. We are not owned by a big corporation trying to “greenwash” but are instead trying to change the status quo. We believe that by basing ourselves in a strong community, listening to our customers, and trying to be leaders and not followers, we can use cleaners as a tool for change in your life... and in your bathroom;) Ryan Lupberger | CEORyan Lupberger has had a lifelong passion for building responsible brands and social movements. He’s worked at the Unreasonable Institute, The Lewis Institute for Social Innovation, and the CPG company, Think-Board, amongst others. He’s been featured as an American Express Changemaker and in 2017 was selected to give a TEDx titled “Why Millennials Why Millennials are Done With Green Brands and Why It Matters”. He’s also a contributor for Conscious Company Media and want to improve efficacy of social entrepreneurship by advocating that positioning excellence first, then impact second will make a more meaningful, lasting impact.Zachary Bedrosian | CTOZachary Bedrosian was a key developer and designer at Learning Ally, the world's largest non profit technology company focusing on dyslexia and learning disabilities. During his time there, he saw the need for combining design, technology, and “good” business and decided to do something about it. After winning the IDG Boston award for Excellence in Technology, Zachary took his web development and design skills to the antiquated cleaning industry to help close the gap between good products and good design and to help inspire the next generation of responsible purchasing.Carlos Pinzon | Director of R&D Carlos Pinzon is an engineer on a mission. He has 10+ years of experience working in the pharmaceutical industry and on projects sponsored by the National Science Foundation, holds PhD from University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez in chemistry and rheology, and is a key stakeholder in the R&D community in Puerto Rico. He’s experienced in bringing innovation to the pharma industry and is now re-energizing and reimagining the green cleaning industry.And OthersCleancult is also supported by a crack team of Puerto Ricans like Luis Santiago and Claudia Gerena. We would not have been able to produce cleancult without the help of our awesome team of freelancers, friends, and advisors. What are the ingredients in Cleancult? Great question! All of our ingredients are listed on our packaging and the full list can be found on our website at cleancult.com. When we say full list, we mean three or four ingredients for each product because yeah, these products rock...without the long chemical names. Will I be able to customize my plan? Yes, 100%! After the campaign closes, your profile will automatically be added to cleancult.com. From there, you’ll be able to change your plan, switch your cleaners based on the plan you selected, and change your shipment date once you get your activation email.Where are the products made?Our all purpose cleaner and liquid dish soap is made in Vermont. Our dryer sheets, dish pacs, and laundry pacs are all made in NY. Our headquarters is, however, in Puerto Rico with some of the best scientists in the world!When will I be able to start receiving my amazing cleancult cleaning products? You will receive an email to activate your membership 48-72 hours after the campaign closes. From then, your products will ship 4 to 8 weeks after the campaign closes and you’ll be able to set your delivery frequency schedule.Is cleancult a subscription box company? Will I get a box with your products every month?Nope! You can shop on our site cleancult.com and choose any products you like and have them delivered at any time. You just won’t get the amazing Indiegogo launch discount.Why aren’t your products verified as EPA Safer Choice? Great question! They will be. We’ve used all ingredients approved as EPA Safer choice options, but our brand is so new that we have yet get approved. The same goes with EWG. We’ll hopefully be listed on the site later this year.What is the difference between getting a membership on Indiegogo versus buying it on your website? Everyone else after this Indiegogo will purchase our products at market price. With the support of our launch, you are getting over a 65% discount! Also, we won’t start selling on our site until later in the year.How does shipping work?For US shipping, the shipping is included in the Indiegogo perk costs. Wow, what a bargain! For international shipping, it depends on the size and location.Do you test products on animals?No, we never do. All of our products are 100% cruelty-free.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

As the company is being successfully bootstrapped by the founders from day one, most of the acquired funds will go into a new industrial solution for plastic injection that will lower the production cost and allow us to produce more than one unit per hour.
Thank you for your support and here's to a great future together!

<p>What is so radically different about the Alinker? Watch the TEDx talk Barbara Alink recently did about the design process and vision behind the Alinker.</p><p>Barbara designed the Alinker for the experience of the user and instead of approaching the functional requirements for the physical disability, her design premise for the Alinker was that it needed to be <b>cool</b>, <b>so cool</b> that the user would <b>love</b> to use it. So <b>cool</b> that the user would feel <b>proud and be happy</b>, and ultimately <b>so cool</b> that it would overcome the discomfort that other people have with the disability.</p><div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">On the Alinker you can be upright and actively moving, be at eye-level, have your hands free, have no stress on the lower limbs, sit with good posture, be stable and feel safe.  </span><br/><br/>

<h2 style=""font-family:'Titillium Web',sans-serif;font-size:2em;color:#ffc000;"">Our Mission</h2>
<p>The Alinker was introduced to the Dutch market after a crowdfunding campaign in 2015. There is now a loyal customer base in the Netherlands, full of users and partners who love to share with us what they can do, now that they have an Alinker. Whether it’s being able to walk their dog everyday, or participate in a 20k walk, the Alinker allows people to live their lives, fully and happy.</p>
<p>Our mission is to create revolutionary solutions for people who want to live an active life, regardless of physical challenges. Our goal is to make it as easy and fun as possible for people to stay physically active, socially connected, and emotionally engaged in the community.</p>
<p>We think the Alinker can change the world, and we need your help.</p>

<h2 style=""font-family:'Titillium Web',sans-serif;font-size:2em;color:#ffc000;""><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
<p>Barbara Alink is a Dutch designer, architect, humanitarian, and inventor of the Alinker, who now lives in Canada.</p>
<p>The Alinker story started with a comment of Barbara’s aging mother- Antonia Esman. While passing some elderly people with walkers and scooters, she said: ""over my dead body will I ever use one of those!”. Barbara set out to design something better for her mum, but started realizing that what she set out to design needed to become a vehicle for social change, challenging our assumptions about people with disabilities.</p>

<p>Now, we extended the campaign until the 20th of June! When we reach $300K it will allow us to set up for larger production runs and develop custom accessories like baskets &amp; carry-on bags for the Alinker.

A radically different ""mobility aid""
What is so radically different about the Alinker? Watch the TEDx talk Barbara Alink recently did about the design process and vision behind the Alinker.Barbara designed the Alinker for the experience of the user and instead of approaching the functional requirements for the physical disability, her design premise for the Alinker was that it needed to be cool, so cool that the user would love to use it. So cool that the user would feel proud and be happy, and ultimately so cool that it would overcome the discomfort that other people have with the disability.

On the Alinker you can be upright and actively moving, be at eye-level, have your hands free, have no stress on the lower limbs, sit with good posture, be stable and feel safe.  

As seen on


Changing Lives






Our Mission
The Alinker was introduced to the Dutch market after a crowdfunding campaign in 2015. There is now a loyal customer base in the Netherlands, full of users and partners who love to share with us what they can do, now that they have an Alinker. Whether it’s being able to walk their dog everyday, or participate in a 20k walk, the Alinker allows people to live their lives, fully and happy.
Our mission is to create revolutionary solutions for people who want to live an active life, regardless of physical challenges. Our goal is to make it as easy and fun as possible for people to stay physically active, socially connected, and emotionally engaged in the community.
We think the Alinker can change the world, and we need your help.


""Do what you’re passionate about and take care of each other! Don’t let anything stand in your way"" - Barbara Alink





Our Story
Barbara Alink is a Dutch designer, architect, humanitarian, and inventor of the Alinker, who now lives in Canada.
The Alinker story started with a comment of Barbara’s aging mother- Antonia Esman. While passing some elderly people with walkers and scooters, she said: ""over my dead body will I ever use one of those!”. Barbara set out to design something better for her mum, but started realizing that what she set out to design needed to become a vehicle for social change, challenging our assumptions about people with disabilities.






""I never cared to be cool, until I was not cool anymore."" - John Perry Barlow



Do what you love, no matter what
Conventional designs aim to transport the user from point A to point B, but neglect the physical, social, and emotional well-being of the individual.
Whether you are just getting older, feeling chronic aches and pains, or recovering from an injury, you probably want to keep living your life.



Introducing the Alinker
The Alinker is designed for people with mobility challenges or limitations who want to stay active no matter what. Most us of us enjoy physical exercise, social outings, and being included and treated like everyone else.





""It may sound dramatic, but the moment I got on the Alinker, my life changed...I have my legs back"" - Joe

These are all interconnected with other vital organs of your body, so it is easy to imagine the negative impact that unsuitable insoles could have, not just on your feet but your whole wellbeing.</p><p>How do existing insoles actually cater to all of the different foot shapes? Unfortunately, the short answer is, they don't. You may see insoles that need to be cut with scissors to ensure ""best fitment"". You may also see memory foam insoles which typically quickly ""bottom-out"" because the foam's core structure is weak.

In our test release, we used different colors, we had beige, black, brown and orange. The insoles also had a different logo that we felt didn't do the insole its justice. We decided to create a new color scheme for our global release and also added highly reflective material to our new minimal logo placed under the heel.

These are all interconnected with other vital organs of your body, so it is easy to imagine the negative impact that unsuitable insoles could have, not just on your feet but your whole wellbeing.How do existing insoles actually cater to all of the different foot shapes? Unfortunately, the short answer is, they don't. You may see insoles that need to be cut with scissors to ensure ""best fitment"". You may also see memory foam insoles which typically quickly ""bottom-out"" because the foam's core structure is weak. Whilst having some kind of insole may be better than none, it is worth taking an extra step to find an insole that truly is optimal for your foot and make every second you spend on your feet better! We are an active team that participate in a range of activities such as Running, Basketball, Soccer, Golf, Mountain-Biking, Motocross, Snowboarding and Hiking. We are familiar with the strains such strenuous activities impose on our bodies, and many start at the feet!. We knew from the beginning that the ideal insole had to be able to withstand the large amounts of pressure these kinds of activities put on one's feet and the rest of their body.Our insoles are the product of 4 years of testing and engineering. When you buy a pair of Z-Liners here on Indiegogo, you're getting top quality, revolutionary insoles for only £19/$24. The reason for this; our insoles are made in our own factory, we are able to cut significant costs that other brands face. This allows us to cut the mark-up from our insoles entirely. This also lets us bring you the most recent technology in the insole market for half the price that you would normally see. If we used a 3rd party factory instead, the price of Z-Liners would double or even triple in some cases. Everything on our insole has been carefully considered. Our main concern is our supporters health and overall wellbeing. We use many distinct processes to create each pair of Z-Liners. More info on this below! Our honeycomb design uses one of nature's strongest patterns to create an ideal footbed for performance and for your wellbeing. The strength of our HPE (High Performance Elastomer) material and ergonomic design allows the insole to actively adapt to your feet without compromising structural integrity and stability. This means you won't experience bottom-outs/flat spots. Z-liners hold their form under the most demanding times, giving an exceptional feeling of balance and grounded-ness. Balance is a crucial element to have in one's arsenal, as it is important in any activity we do, and the last thing you need letting you down is your insoles! Our insoles have been tested with different types of microorganisms and are proven to be effective at fighting them off (*please refer to test results further down). Have extra confidence in your Z-liners knowing that bacteria and microbes are being actively fought-off, even when you're not wearing them!Z-Liners are friendly to our bodies and the environment as well. We use a unique manufacturing process which allows us to build our entire insole without using any harsh glues or bonding compounds. This means you don't have to worry about any foreign substances being absorbed into your skin and the environment after disposal. Also makes them the perfect pair to wear with your feet bare. You can even use them sock-less!Go Commando With Z-Liners!There are over 250,000 sweat glands in our feet, secreting up to a half-pint of sweat a day. Our breathable mesh fabric and honeycomb design allows for moisture to dissipate away from the foot and bring in airflow to help keep your feet as dry, cool and odor-free as possible. Also, being that there are no adhesives used, it gives even greater airflow by leaving the pores of the insole unobstructed by glue and other adhesive compounds. Added support that forms to your arch as your wear them, helping bring a more confident sense of balance and also helping reduce and remove pain in your lower extremities. Our robust honeycomb design and durable material provide ultimate shock absorbing properties and give your feet added rest by dispersing the hard impact throughout the insole, harnessing your whole foot rather than focusing stress on localized areas. We didn't just stop at using antimicrobial/antibacterial properties. We have gone above and beyond to make sure the Z-Liners could also withstand the harshness of being thrown in the wash and dryer for a few hours. If you soil them, don't worry about buying another pair, just toss them in the washing machine like you would with your clothes and garments. They'll come out fresh and clean! It's counter-intuitive to make an insole that is anything less than a precise fitment. Its our feet we're talking about here! If our feet aren't happy, we aren't either. This is why we made it a priority to make sure that our insoles were made in all sizes, even half sizes! No more cutting or trimming necessary! Currently, we are getting ready for our global launch. We recently had Z-liners in a small test market in the U.K. We were received positively and have over 100 reviews generated from our customer base. In our test release, we used different colors, we had beige, black, brown and orange. The insoles also had a different logo that we felt didn't do the insole its justice. We decided to create a new color scheme for our global release and also added highly reflective material to our new minimal logo placed under the heel. We had our eyes set on charcoal grey as it makes a perfect unisex color.We are hoping that you can help reach our goal and potentially beyond! This will allow us to start shipping our insoles internationally in bulk for a reduced shipping price.
