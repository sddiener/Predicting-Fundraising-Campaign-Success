Kate Parsons - Video Artist

""In today’s media saturated world, we often live in a constant state of mental anxiety and chaos, a cacophony of stimuli and expectations. My work deals with this discomfort, which is not limited to a mere moment but is instead ever-present. I use a mix of analog video and audio to create a feeling of discord as each signal fights for airtime. This process, which can be considered a “hack”, results in the breakdown of the image, which ironically can produce formally pleasing results.
Ultimately, my current work is about failure and the struggle for power and control as realized through the use of technology. It references ideas from cognitive psychology, specifically cognitive dissonance, distortion, and catastrophizing.  ""



Jessica Giacobbe                           (Directors Assistant)


Jessica Giacobbe is an artist/filmmaker from a small town outside Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 2014 She received her BFA in Multidisciplinary Fine Arts with a concentration in Film/Digital Video at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Her work is inspired by the idea of progress, specifically the stimuli initiating that
progress. Examining life as a chemical reaction, viewing her work as an improvisational
and catalytic process. Working heavily from intuition and finding that utilizing instinctual
feelings of risk, trust, and reliance can create magic. 
Giacobbe has exhibited in many group showings such as Making It! Exhibition, Watch Your Step!, Crave, 5x7, and Art Unleashed in Philadelphia, PA.  She has been internationally exhibited in the ARCANIUM Video/Animation Festival  (Levenda, Slovenia).  In May 2014 she had her first solo exhibition, Catalysts and Aftershocks, at JAG Modern Art in Philadelphia, PA.

<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Renee </span>joined our team nearly two years ago.  I met <a href=""http://www.renee-anne.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Renee Anne""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Renee</span></a> through <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><a href=""http://www.leeloo.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Leeloo web site"">Leeloo</a></span>, because she was a sweet young thing looking

<p>Renee is now an

(<a href=""http://www.renee-anne.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Renee Anne"">http://www.renee-anne.com.au</a>)<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We spend a great deal of our time promoting the work of the <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><a href=""http://www.leeloo.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Leeloo web site"">Leeloo</a></span> family, be it through <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">press coverage, advertising, written editorial contributions both in print and online</span> and pride ourselves in being able to give <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">helpful advice</span> to those who have just begun their journey from<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> hobby to potential self-employment</span> through something creative that they enjoy.  I (Angela) also provide ethical fashion <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">styling services</span> to people on the odd occasion (you can see some of my work on<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> The Loop</span> - <a href=""http://www.theloop.com.au/app/people/portfolio/angela"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Loop Portfolio"">http://www.theloop.com.au/app/people/portfolio/angela</a>), and I prefer to use <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><a href=""http://www.leeloo.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Leeloo web site"">Leeloo</a></span> family goodies whenever I can, or those from within the Australian indie community.<br/></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><a href=""http://www.leeloo.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Leeloo web site"">Leeloo</a></span> is a 'curated' store, in that we take submissions from those who wish to be part of our team.  We also promote the work of the indie artistic and design community-at-large through our blog, as well as our regular stall at the massive <a href=""http://www.thefinderskeepers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Finders Keepers Market""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Finders Keepers market</span></a>, held bi-annually in <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne</span>.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This further extends our support with exposure to new audiences for our team of designers and artists, and allows them the opportunity to have a <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">presence at the market</span> should they not have a stall themselves <span style=""font-style: italic;"">(either due to distance, cost or that their own submission was unsuccessful to have a stall)</span>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have also curated and completely project managed five <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">art exhibitions</span>,

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The first <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Etsy </span>conference (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hello Etsy </span>- <a href=""http://www.helloetsy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""hello etsy"">http://www.helloetsy.com</a>) will be held this year in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Berlin in September</span>.  The conference will focus on sustainability in small businesses and will include speakers and sponsors involved within the Etsy community, the worldwide community of designers and artists, and beyond.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In order to continue to gain the latest knowledge to support the <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><a href=""http://www.leeloo.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Leeloo web site"">Leeloo</a></span> mission and the best kind of support to our growing family of designers and artists, for us to gain further knowledge and maintain our expertise in this area, it is imperative that both myself and Renee are able to learn from the world leaders in small online design business retail; <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Etsy </span>and it's community.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Berlin </span>being one of the world's top destinations for art galleries, exhibitions and other creative events, will allow us to experience first-hand the latest ideas in art, design, exhibiting, to see how the <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">global benchmark</span> is being set, and therefore bring these ideas and inspiration back home to not only <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><a href=""http://www.leeloo.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Leeloo web site"">Leeloo</a></span>, but to share that vision with our local community, in both Sydney and Australia.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to buy our <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">tickets </span>to the conference which are <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">85 Euros</span> each (x 2).</p>
<p>We need our <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">accommodation </span>for a week in Berlin which will be approximately <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">500 Euros</span> (we'll be staying in small apartment rentals / bed and breakfast type accommodation).</p>
<p>We need money for our <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">airfares</span>, which at this stage will cost approximately <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$5000 AUD</span>.</p>
<p>We'll also need some <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">survival money</span> for the week, for food and such.  We think that will be around <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$1000 AUD</span>.</p>
<p>So, we're going to ask you lovely people to help us get at least partially towards our target.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Renee and I are currently going through our 'stuff'.  We're going to be holding an online garage sale to hopefully raise some of the funds we need and we'll be continuing to work towards our goal as we're super keen to get there.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>You can help us with a financial contribution ranging from $10 to $250.  Each level of contribution provides you with a perk.  Perks include raffle tickets, discounts, art prints and originals.  If you contribute any amount, you will know that you have supported our work at <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><a href=""http://www.leeloo.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Leeloo web site"">Leeloo</a></span>, and therefore supported the Australian independent art and design community. We will be eternally grateful. :-)<br/></p>

Leeloo is an online community for upcoming Australian designers and emerging artists to have a web based environment within which to sell their goodies whilst continuing their focus on their practice.  The web site can be found here : http://www.leeloo.com.au  We are based in Sydney, NSW, Australia and are a very small community business.

I (Angela) started Leeloo with a mission to provide online commercial exposure to young people who show talent and need a start, but may not necessarily have the time or skills to do all of the work themselves.  Whilst a lot of these designers have their own Etsy stores (http://www.etsy.com), Leeloo provides an opportunity for them to be grouped amongst other like-minded Australian designers, and provides focused attention to their products within a nurturing community-based environment.

Renee joined our team nearly two years ago.  I met Renee through Leeloo, because she was a sweet young thing looking 
for someone who could help get her art out there.  Originally an artist and crafter that was part of the Leeloo family, she showed great initiative in wanting to learn the business, as well as work with me (Angela) on setting up exhibitions and how to kick-start her own career as a stylist.  
Renee is now an 
essential part of the Leeloo team, and provides enthusiasm, passion, 
hard-work and raw talent to all of our endeavours.Renee also has a successful blog of her own where she supports international art, design, photography and more. (http://www.renee-anne.com.au)

We spend a great deal of our time promoting the work of the Leeloo family, be it through press coverage, advertising, written editorial contributions both in print and online and pride ourselves in being able to give helpful advice to those who have just begun their journey from hobby to potential self-employment through something creative that they enjoy.  I (Angela) also provide ethical fashion styling services to people on the odd occasion (you can see some of my work on The Loop - http://www.theloop.com.au/app/people/portfolio/angela), and I prefer to use Leeloo family goodies whenever I can, or those from within the Australian indie community.

Leeloo is a 'curated' store, in that we take submissions from those who wish to be part of our team.  We also promote the work of the indie artistic and design community-at-large through our blog, as well as our regular stall at the massive Finders Keepers market, held bi-annually in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne.  

This further extends our support with exposure to new audiences for our team of designers and artists, and allows them the opportunity to have a presence at the market should they not have a stall themselves (either due to distance, cost or that their own submission was unsuccessful to have a stall).

We have also curated and completely project managed five art exhibitions, 
including Once Upon, DisBand, Drawn From Fashion.  Each of these exhibitions has been a theme based exposition of independent young Australian artists, not all of which are necessarily part of the Leeloo store itself.

Leeloo has been active for over three years now, and has carved a sweet niche for itself in the hearts of our followers, and in the loyalty of the designers and artists we work with, but we have hit a point in the life cycle of our business where we require some inspiration, guidance and new ideas.

The Impact
The first Etsy conference (Hello Etsy - http://www.helloetsy.com) will be held this year in Berlin in September.  The conference will focus on sustainability in small businesses and will include speakers and sponsors involved within the Etsy community, the worldwide community of designers and artists, and beyond.

In order to continue to gain the latest knowledge to support the Leeloo mission and the best kind of support to our growing family of designers and artists, for us to gain further knowledge and maintain our expertise in this area, it is imperative that both myself and Renee are able to learn from the world leaders in small online design business retail; Etsy and it's community.

Berlin being one of the world's top destinations for art galleries, exhibitions and other creative events, will allow us to experience first-hand the latest ideas in art, design, exhibiting, to see how the global benchmark is being set, and therefore bring these ideas and inspiration back home to not only Leeloo, but to share that vision with our local community, in both Sydney and Australia.

What We Need & What You Get
We need to buy our tickets to the conference which are 85 Euros each (x 2).
We need our accommodation for a week in Berlin which will be approximately 500 Euros (we'll be staying in small apartment rentals / bed and breakfast type accommodation).
We need money for our airfares, which at this stage will cost approximately $5000 AUD.
We'll also need some survival money for the week, for food and such.  We think that will be around $1000 AUD.
So, we're going to ask you lovely people to help us get at least partially towards our target.

Renee and I are currently going through our 'stuff'.  We're going to be holding an online garage sale to hopefully raise some of the funds we need and we'll be continuing to work towards our goal as we're super keen to get there.  

You can help us with a financial contribution ranging from $10 to $250.  Each level of contribution provides you with a perk.  Perks include raffle tickets, discounts, art prints and originals.  If you contribute any amount, you will know that you have supported our work at Leeloo, and therefore supported the Australian independent art and design community. We will be eternally grateful. :-)

In addition to my involvement as a Fulbright Scholar, I have fund-raised and organized two Christmas parties, the latter for +500 people, and also volunteered my time to teach English classes to the youth. <br/><br/>
Coco Solo is a “squatter community” of approximately 400 families living in the barracks of a former US Naval Base. The Panamanian Government relocated local families into the barracks in the late 1980’s when US military usage ended. Although they were intended as temporary public housing, 30 years later people remain and the infrastructure is shoddy at best. There is no running water and barely any electricity; the majority of the population is under 15 years of age. <br/><br/>
To kick start a long-term and self-sustaining project, I, along with my collaborators, Lorena Endara and Keenan Lee are asking for donations to start a photography and digital literacy workshop program. Our preliminary goal is to offer this intensive course to the youth of Coco Solo on site. The classes will include slide shows, tutorials, shooting sessions, journaling and guided writing time. Participants will be encouraged to think critically about the photographs they are making and write pieces inspired by the content of their photography. Each student will also have a journal which they can use to organize their photographs and writing into. <br/><br/>
Through this long-term effort, we believe that the community will benefit greatly. The youth of Coco Solo will acquire valuable skills in digital technology such as cameras, computers, etc. while at the same time learning to find and express their own voices, creativity, and self-esteem. The ability to self-represent will undoubtedly provide a life-long ability to lobby for their own needs, whether better housing, health, and/or education.      <br/><br/>
After each set of workshops is completed, the students, along with the mentors, will assemble a book that compiles the bodies of work altogether. The book will consist of photography and writing produced by the students during the workshop, as well as pages from journals. This book made by the students can then be published and sold to the general public with all profits returning to the community.</p></div>","My name is Rose Marie Cromwell and I have collaborated with the community of Coco Solo in Colon City (Panama) for the past 3 years.

<p><strong>THE BEACH. </strong>We all love the beach: An enduring physical expression of our world’s breath taking fragile beauty, where surfers ride their waves, families join nature for fun, our holiday dreams come true and to create memories for a lifetime. Our planet’s beaches are as powerful today as throughout human time; making up less than one per cent of the world’s landmass but are home to some of the planet’s most abandoned eco-systems. Every flowing grain of sand has its place, sculptured by wind, waves and tide, protecting us from roaring seas. Our coastlines are the most dynamic features on earth. From ancient civilisations to modern metropolises we have depended on our shorelines for food, trade, commerce and safety. Today 11 of the world’s 15 largest cities are located on a coast or river estuary. By 2025 it is projected that 75% of our population will live in a coastal area. The effects are starting to show. Over -development, poor coastal management and pollution are pushing this vital ecosystem to the brink. The multi-billion dollar business of sand mining, the building of dykes and jetties interrupt nature’s dynamic resilient process causing unintended damaging erosion elsewhere. Catastrophic weather events, rising sea levels and oil spills have ravaged many communities, and this is only the beginning.</p>

<p><strong>How we do this: </strong>We create a limited edition of ""Beach Pictures"". We have adapted the lacquer peel method to preserve soil and sand profiles that was developed around 1930 by the German geologist Prof. E. Voigt at the Institute for Geology, University of Halle, Germany. A thin film of diluted lacquer is applied by a spray or brush onto the smoothed face of a beach profile. After one or more layers of lacquer have been applied and allowed to dry, the film, usually reinforced by cloth is loosened from the face. The soil material will remain attached to the hardened lacquer, thus giving a natural replica of the sand profile in the form of a thin lacquer peel or lacquer profile of about 2,0 to 4,0mm preserving the authentic structure and character of the Beach. This relatively easy method is well suited to dry soils with a sandy to light clay texture. The result of the exercise is immediately visible. The lacquer peels are light in weight and easy to transport, to handle, to exhibit and to store.  Then the profile gets mounted on a stretched canvas frame. Finally you get a fine piece of hand crafted artwork. All used materials and production processes are measurable sustainable and 100% eco friendly. The first edition will be offered in three sizes, 10x1sqm, 20x0,5sqm, 40x 0,25sqm per Beach. With every BEACHPIX. comes a tagged QR Code Print on Acryl, connecting the artwork with the free <strong>BEACHPIX APP</strong> for mobile devices like the Apple iPad.</p>
<p><img alt=""BEACHPIX"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BxePi-fsDzg/UFXpcq59UqI/AAAAAAAAA6w/q3sR_R-zjT4/s800/Bildschirmfoto%25202012-09-16%2520um%252016.42.49.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""PAGE8""/></p>
<p><strong>THE BEACHPIX.APP</strong> In a world where location-based services are becoming more popular and lucrative we  use the newest innovative technology. The App connects you at home direct to your dream beach. Geo tagging via GPS data allows to define the exact position of your piece of art at every beach. The easy to use App shows the 360<sup>o</sup> panoramic view of your beach, an overview map is showing all documented places and connects you with the community of other owners/supporters via Facebook. On FB we also post daily news and stories during the making of, offering transparent informations and polls to the interested community.</p>
<p>From the <strong>A</strong>ntilles to <strong>Z</strong>akynthos, until now we have a temporary selection of the 100 most beautiful beaches and surf spots on earth.  The evaluation is based on different rankings that have been screened: Lonely Planet, Tripadvisor, National Geographic CNN GO, Bloomberg, Forbes, The Guardian, Surfline.com and Surfer Magazine.</p>
<h3>We are working on this and will publish the final list asap on this site.</h3>

<p><strong>THE BEACHPIX. EXHIBITION </strong>We need visions of a sustainable life that interconnect with the sensuality, lust and passion of acting on our own, examples to follow! The BEACHPIX. exhibition intends to encourage this and to move the cultural and aesthetic dimension of sustainability into the common sense, making the amazing beauty of beaches arround the globe visible. The exhibition aims at raising awareness for how to think in transitions, interim solutions, models, and projects. Artistic questions and concepts for action increasingly aim at the multi-layered domains of ecology as well as towards enlarging their social resonance space. Sustainability needs a space for development in which the multiple interconnections between the existing wealth of knowledge and experience in the arts and sciences as well as the idea that each individual can be a part of this can truly unfold.</p>
<p>The BEACHPIX. exhibition demonstrates an artistic practice that contributes to the preservation of the planets most beautiful places, and intends to influence conscious consumer behaviour. We also showcase the artistic position in which the boundaries between art, activism and inventions dissolve and the experiences and methods of environmental initiatives inter-connect with artistic approaches. One should never fall into belief, a small group of imaginative, dedicated people can´t change the world. In fact, the world has never been changed by something else.</p>

<p><strong>THE BEACHPIX. CARE PROGRAMS </strong>supports local coastal recreation communities through a shared goal of raising public awareness about beach conservation and inspiring people to help protect the most dynamic vital eco system on earth. With a part of our earnings we support organisations with focus on local initiatives like coastal community beach care programs. We deliver the equipment and know how to produce locally own BEACHPIX. editions to gain income for further local beach care projects. On the other hand we get alerts, representative  and measurable data form every local supported beach team that can be implemented in Google Earth or Apple Maps. We believe that this data is very interesting for the travel business too.</p>
<p><strong>Because</strong> the question is no longer whether climate change is causing the erosion of coastlines and beaches, but by how much and how fast. The effects of global change is an increasing number of storms and probably  the intensity of storm surge. The climate models all suggest that those kinds of effects are happening and so coastlines arround the world are subjected to more pressure from storms. In addition of course the sealevel is rising as a result of warming of the ocean which expands the water, but also melting of glaciers and ice caps putting more water into the ocean. So those things acting together are a real challenge to coastlines. Its especially survivor in low line areas such als the Pacific Island Nations, Bangladesh, and elsewhere, but its also a problem in the developed world. Places like Florida for example are very low lined and are a subject to both, storms and sealevel rise. For coastal communities arround the globe, those eroding effects  isn’t a distant, abstract fear, it’s happening now and it’s threatening their way of life.</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps </strong>Programming of the BEACHPIX application and our online appearance including online PR and Marcom Strategy incl. content development and implementation of a WCMS based online appearance including a store, social media tools, multi language SEO and a web tracking tool. Your seed capital will help us to launch the project, buying materials and equipment, hiring and training of 3 fair paid teams of students. Project start is planned spring 2013 until late autumn 2013.</p>
<p>But to have the cash on hand to run the project in its first months, before sales can escalate, we need to raise at least <strong>€10.000</strong> in start up capital. Would you help us to turn our ambitions into accomplishments by helping with a sponsorship to help us get launched? Would you take action for one of the most amazing places on earth?</p>
<h3><strong>But time is limited. the Gruender-Garage, a competition for entrepreneurs created by Google, Indiegogo and Stiftung Entrepreneurship ends on October 12<sup>th.</sup>. <br/></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Make a difference - sponsor BEACHPIX. now!</strong></h3>
<h3>Many Thankz!</h3>
<p>As further sales channels we will use our own online store, different online art and lifestyle platforms like for example the Saatchi Online Galerie, Etsy...AHA Life, but also gallery exhibitions, art fairs and special event installations. Of course we are searching for strategic partners to support the project. As for example NGO´s, and institutions to outdoor fashion and lifestyle brands, airlines or the travel business we´d like to welcome to support BEACHPIX.</p>

After one or more layers of lacquer have been applied and allowed to dry, the film, usually reinforced by cloth is loosened from the face. The soil material will remain attached to the hardened lacquer, thus giving a natural replica of the sand profile in the form of a thin lacquer peel or lacquer profile of about 2,0 to 4,0mm preserving the authentic structure and character of the Beach. This relatively easy method is well suited to dry soils with a sandy to light clay texture. The result of the exercise is immediately visible. The lacquer peels are light in weight and easy to transport, to handle, to exhibit and to store.  Then the profile gets mounted on a stretched canvas frame. Finally you get a fine piece of hand crafted artwork. All used materials and production processes are measurable sustainable and 100% eco friendly. The first edition will be offered in three sizes, 10x1sqm, 20x0,5sqm, 40x 0,25sqm per Beach. With every BEACHPIX. comes a tagged QR Code Print on Acryl, connecting the artwork with the free BEACHPIX APP for mobile devices like the Apple iPad.

THE BEACHPIX.APP In a world where location-based services are becoming more popular and lucrative we  use the newest innovative technology. The App connects you at home direct to your dream beach. Geo tagging via GPS data allows to define the exact position of your piece of art at every beach. The easy to use App shows the 360o panoramic view of your beach, an overview map is showing all documented places and connects you with the community of other owners/supporters via Facebook. On FB we also post daily news and stories during the making of, offering transparent informations and polls to the interested community.
From the Antilles to Zakynthos, until now we have a temporary selection of the 100 most beautiful beaches and surf spots on earth.  The evaluation is based on different rankings that have been screened: Lonely Planet, Tripadvisor, National Geographic CNN GO, Bloomberg, Forbes, The Guardian, Surfline.com and Surfer Magazine.
We are working on this and will publish the final list asap on this site.


THE BEACHPIX. EXHIBITION We need visions of a sustainable life that interconnect with the sensuality, lust and passion of acting on our own, examples to follow! The BEACHPIX. exhibition intends to encourage this and to move the cultural and aesthetic dimension of sustainability into the common sense, making the amazing beauty of beaches arround the globe visible. The exhibition aims at raising awareness for how to think in transitions, interim solutions, models, and projects. Artistic questions and concepts for action increasingly aim at the multi-layered domains of ecology as well as towards enlarging their social resonance space. Sustainability needs a space for development in which the multiple interconnections between the existing wealth of knowledge and experience in the arts and sciences as well as the idea that each individual can be a part of this can truly unfold.
The BEACHPIX. exhibition demonstrates an artistic practice that contributes to the preservation of the planets most beautiful places, and intends to influence conscious consumer behaviour. We also showcase the artistic position in which the boundaries between art, activism and inventions dissolve and the experiences and methods of environmental initiatives inter-connect with artistic approaches. One should never fall into belief, a small group of imaginative, dedicated people can´t change the world. In fact, the world has never been changed by something else.

THE BEACHPIX. CARE PROGRAMS supports local coastal recreation communities through a shared goal of raising public awareness about beach conservation and inspiring people to help protect the most dynamic vital eco system on earth. With a part of our earnings we support organisations with focus on local initiatives like coastal community beach care programs. We deliver the equipment and know how to produce locally own BEACHPIX. editions to gain income for further local beach care projects. On the other hand we get alerts, representative  and measurable data form every local supported beach team that can be implemented in Google Earth or Apple Maps. We believe that this data is very interesting for the travel business too.
Because the question is no longer whether climate change is causing the erosion of coastlines and beaches, but by how much and how fast. The effects of global change is an increasing number of storms and probably  the intensity of storm surge. The climate models all suggest that those kinds of effects are happening and so coastlines arround the world are subjected to more pressure from storms. In addition of course the sealevel is rising as a result of warming of the ocean which expands the water, but also melting of glaciers and ice caps putting more water into the ocean. So those things acting together are a real challenge to coastlines. Its especially survivor in low line areas such als the Pacific Island Nations, Bangladesh, and elsewhere, but its also a problem in the developed world. Places like Florida for example are very low lined and are a subject to both, storms and sealevel rise. For coastal communities arround the globe, those eroding effects  isn’t a distant, abstract fear, it’s happening now and it’s threatening their way of life.
Next Steps Programming of the BEACHPIX application and our online appearance including online PR and Marcom Strategy incl. content development and implementation of a WCMS based online appearance including a store, social media tools, multi language SEO and a web tracking tool. Your seed capital will help us to launch the project, buying materials and equipment, hiring and training of 3 fair paid teams of students. Project start is planned spring 2013 until late autumn 2013.
But to have the cash on hand to run the project in its first months, before sales can escalate, we need to raise at least €10.000 in start up capital. Would you help us to turn our ambitions into accomplishments by helping with a sponsorship to help us get launched? Would you take action for one of the most amazing places on earth?
But time is limited. the Gruender-Garage, a competition for entrepreneurs created by Google, Indiegogo and Stiftung Entrepreneurship ends on October 12th.. 
Make a difference - sponsor BEACHPIX. now!

What is the idea behind the ‘BE’ exhibition?
The idea is to capture the creative spirit of 10 individuals in Hong Kong in order to show their true state of being while they are engaging in their chosen creative field or life path. We will attempt to capture this invisible creative spirit by using a series of photos while the artist or creative is at work, to show the transient nature of the outward form and the power of the inner spirit. Using the photos as a source of inspiration, the essence of these will then be transformed into a series of powerful paintings produced by KA.
Who are these individuals?
Whatever their chosen path maybe eg. music, writing, design, painting, acting photography or social cause; these individuals all have one thing in common – an intense passion to create their own life. They know this is what their hearts call for and persistently want to pursue it in their lives. It is this powerful “being-ness” within the individuals that we would like to capture and share with the world.
What message is this exhibition trying to convey?
Creativity is derived from beyond the mind, from an invisible universal force. We hope to spread this force to all corners of Hong Kong and beyond. To inspire those who live in this mind and form dominated society to let go of their fears and to have the courage to embrace their child-like essence and just ""BE""who they truly are.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Fresh Grounds Coffeehouse &amp; Cafe is a non-profit coffeehouse who mission is to positively effect the lives of those in our community through building relationship, offering programs unlike anything already taking place in the community and a place for anyone of any age to come and relax, enjoy a cup of coffee of even just play a game all with the love of Christ. </p>
<p>Fresh Grounds has been open for a year now. The process of opening took 3 and a half years of donated time and money and over 100 volunteers renovate the space, back to its (1890) original beauty.</p>
<p>The coffee shop has made quite an impact already in our greater community. Friday evenings have become a haven for 80+ youth who finally have a place to hangout. Our town has suffered major industry loss, being in the rust belt, and has yet to pick itself up off its feet... not yet.</p>
<p>We have great faith in our community, and although they have already been of great support to Fresh Grounds in our current operations and in the raising of salary for the few employees, we are ready for Phase 2.</p>
<p>My job at Fresh Grounds coffeehouse is the director and instructor for the nonprofit art program which I started here. I am currently evening manager of the shop but hope to relieve some of my duties with the coffeehouse part to be able to devote my full attention to the Art Program. I have a great passion for art, I recently received my Bachelors Degree in Fine Arts and have 3 years experience teaching and working with a non-profit organization. The college that I attended and received my degree from is the local college in town and I have been a member of this community for over 13 years. </p>
<p>The Phase 2 project includes installing an elevator as per code requirements. The Art Program will take place on the 2nd floor of the coffeehouse. In addition to the elevator, some renovations will be needed in order for the space to be transformed into a gallery and studio for teaching classes.</p>
<p>I have already begun teaching classes in the coffee shop, making due with the little resources we have and since classes have started in the fall of 2010 I have successfully brought over 40 students through various courses including drawing, painting, photography and experimental art. I feel very strongly about having inter-generational classes and it has been a joy to see our youngest student (10) work so well with our oldest student (72).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The program has already had two handicap students apply and complete a course, and although we were able to make due, I am excited for the day that they can easily access the renovated 2 floor space and also enjoy the gallery. <br/>
</div>
<div>Our area is also experiencing a shift in our public school funding and the art programs have been greatly effected. I am currently working with an elementary art teacher in the area, who is concerned about her job and realizes even the time constraints she has been given to effectively teach her students. The Fresh Grounds Art Program is committed to serving those in our community, making it affordable to all while still maintaining the excellence that is put into every shot of espresso, that has been put into the renovation of the building and that we will continue to put into every relationship built.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I feel that the arts is definitely getting people more connected and passionate about their community and hopefully will be that push to get our town back on its feet and the Fresh Grounds Art Program will be a crucial part of this revitalization. </div>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Most of the work, construction included, that still happens at the coffee house is done by volunteers which helps reduce the cost! Even some of the big ticket items that are purchased are sold at cost to help benefit the organization.  Great new track lighting has already been donated! We are also 501(c)3 so there is a tax benefit to donating.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$23,000</p>
<p>We have already started raising funds for the elevator and are currently in need of an additional $23,000 to reach our goal. The total cost of the elevator is $50,000. The $27,000 that has been raised to this point has been from local patrons of the coffee shop, a few banks and businesses have made contributions reaching the current total in the matter of 5 months since campaigning began. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$5,000</p>
<p>A new Heating and Cooling system will need to be installed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$2,000</p>
<p>Leaks from the roof will need to be repaired and damaged ceiling sections will need to come down and be replaced.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$5,000</p>
<p>Of the proposed budget this would be the first to be cut should the full funding not come in. That is support. Working in a non-profit environment has been difficult when it comes to raising a salary. I am still very short from my goal. I have taken measures to reduce the amount I need, including getting rid of my car. However, I am still looking for support at this time. </p>

In my work as an artist, I continually try to make something that effects an audience both in the arts and outside of it. </p>
<p><em>Alternative Currency</em> is the closest I've come to producing that. This documentary is about the Cultural Capital of Canada: Calgary, Alberta. A city that has been my home while going to school for the last four years. Throughout that time the most common question I would ask myself is where is my place in a city like Calgary as an emerging artist?</p>
<p><em>Alternative Currency</em> attempts to answer that question by getting the broadest spectrum of the contemporary arts scene in Calgary and the professionals that work in it while at the same time profiling five emerging artists like myself about to enter into the arts community in Calgary. Some of the interviews include:</p>
<p>Herringer Kiss, Paul Kuhn Gallery, Trepanier Baer, Skew, TRUCK, Stride, The New Gallery, EMMedia, Untitled Art Society, The Glenbow Museum, MoCA Calgary, Art Gallery of Calgary, Pith Galleries, Haight Gallery, 809, CAM, Straw Gallery, ESKER Foundation, Illingworth Kerr Gallery, Jarvis Hall Fine Art, AXIS, Market Collective and CADA. As well as interviews with writers, curators, and working professionals in the Calgary Arts community.</p>
<p>Having said that, the documentary is about to enter post-production and will need some financial help if it is to be finished for the premier in September 2012. At this point the project is looking for funding specifically for post-production in editing.</p>
<p>The Editor is Julian Moule, a SAIT film student who has had recent films featured in the Calgary Underground Film Festival and has four years experience editing. I have allotted for a budget of 200 hours at this point which is the equivalent of <strong>$3600.00</strong>.</p>
<p>The edit suite we will be using is at CSIF (Calgary Society of Independent Filmmakers) in the Old Y building. They charge $10.00 per hour, $500.00 for a week and $1800.00 for a month. We will be renting more on a daily/weekly basis based on our availability to edit together and around other suite bookings. I have allotted for the 200 hours of editing in the suite which is the equivalent of <strong>$2000.00</strong>.</p>
<p>This initial financing of the <strong>$5600.00</strong> will be crucial to the documentary finishing in a timely manner and maintaining its relevance to contemporary art in Calgary under the Cultural Capital spotlight for 2012. All funds raised from this campaign will be used towards the editing of the documentary regardless of whether or not we reach the goal of <strong>$5600.00</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Alternative Currency</em> when finished will exist as a document of a time when Calgary was given a brief podium for arts and culture and what the arts community was like during that time. It will also serve as a forum for discussion on how we sustain a Cultural Capital after the spotlight for Calgary has dispersed. Lastly, it will shed some light on how emerging artists can think about the Calgary Arts community and how it could be and should be a place for artists to build a career.</p>
<p>If you decide to support <em>Alternative Currency</em> please know that you are part of a project to help sustain Calgary both culturally and artistically. If you are unable to support, please know that spreading the word about the documentary is just as valuable.</p>

<p>Director of<em> Alternative Currency: A Look at Contemporary Art in Calgary </em></p></div>","Hello, my name is Lewis Liski. I am a recent graduate of the Alberta College of Art and Design in 2012. In my work as an artist, I continually try to make something that effects an audience both in the arts and outside of it. 
Alternative Currency is the closest I've come to producing that. This documentary is about the Cultural Capital of Canada: Calgary, Alberta. A city that has been my home while going to school for the last four years. Throughout that time the most common question I would ask myself is where is my place in a city like Calgary as an emerging artist?
Alternative Currency attempts to answer that question by getting the broadest spectrum of the contemporary arts scene in Calgary and the professionals that work in it while at the same time profiling five emerging artists like myself about to enter into the arts community in Calgary.

<h2>IN MY WORLD</h2>
<p>My name is Alet, and I'm an artist living in Denmark. I make colorings for kids and different types of kids-art. I love creating stuff for kids, (and adults too, that still has a bit of the kid in them;)). So when my daughter at eight asked me one evening if I could make some cute messages for her to read, and put in her lunchbox for school, I started drawing right away. I loved the idea! And that evening 'In my world' was born. Dag Igland, who is a graphic designer, joined me, and he's been working with the layout of the posters, and he c<span>reates print</span><span>-r</span><span>eady</span><span> files of the images.</span></p>
<p>What we love about ""In my World"" are the expressive images and the positive messages, which can help raising the spirits of both kids and adults in our ever faster-moving daily life.</p>
<p>We have started to make 'In My World' boxes, each containing 20 small cards, so you can put a card in a lunchbox, in a pocket, or with a gift, just as a nice surprise. Kids love them, and so do we, so we need to do more! Ten different posters are now ready to get printed, and we can't wait to get started! In children's rooms, kindergardens and on classroom walls, these posters can be great reminders throughout the day, on being NICE to one another!</p>
<p>But, printing is expensive, and that's why we will try to fund the printing costs here on Indiegogo!  </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>We need $1200 to print ten different posters, and expand our making of the 'In My World' boxes. </p>
<p><span>The posters will be printed on 60x 60cm (23,6"" x 23,6""), glossy art-paper, 135g/m².</span><span> </span></p>
<p>One poster is $20 plus $4 for shipping anywhere in Europe, or add $8 for shipping anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>If you would like two posters, you'll get a $5 discount. Shipping costs will be the same as for one poster.</p>
<p>Prints will be shipped in sturdy poster tubes.  </p>
<p>One 'In My World' box is $25 plus $4 for shipping in Europe, or add 8$ for shipping anywhere else in the world. </p>
<p>If you want several posters for a Kindergarden or a school, (or just want to decorate your livingroom:)) we have a nice Bundle Perk! For $115 you will get 8 posters, pluss 10 'In My World' bookmarks. We will have to come back to you regarding shipping costs on this one, since we are trying to get it as cheap as we can! </p>
<div>
<p>For every five posters purchased, we will donate one for a children's hospital. And if you know of any cause near you that works for children, send us a message, and we will add the cause to our giveaway list!</p>

<p>Little Fly Studios is proud to announce the opening of its new Home Studio.  Our new space will host workshops featuring a wide variety of Art and Fine Craft experiences taught by instructors of local and national renown for both youth and adults. In an effort to give back to our community, we will also be offering reduced rate workshops for special needs populations.</p>
<p>The Grand Opening event on June 1, 2013, is designed to provide a free educational experience, celebrating the arts through demonstrations and participatory events. Artwork exhibited will showcase 20+ national and local, professional and emerging artists, including former students from the New Hope-Solebury School District and several Workshop Presenters.  Demonstrations from the artists will include fine art and craft techniques and a participatory community art project for public installation. Music and performances by local artists, and light fare and beverages will also be included in this event.   The Opening is an opportunity for the community to tour our new space and discover the workshops and programs Little Fly Studios has to offer, while celebrating a day of the arts.  This is an all age event and is free to the public.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! My name is Zack. I'm 21 years old and a cartoonist at Millersville University in Pensylvannia. The reason I've started this campain is because I am also a transguy, meaning that I feel a physical disconnect between my biological sex and my mental gender. How can you help? It's quite simple! I need whatever funding I can get to allow me to get surgery to remove my female breasts in exchange for a more masculine sculpt. It's a huge endevour, so I can't do it alone!</p>

<ul>
<li>SPOKEN WORD</li>

<li>BOOK/CD DEBUT AND SIGNING</li>
</ul><p><strong>           SUNDAY, JULY 14TH, 2013</strong></p>
<p>Do you know La Toya A. Hampton, MSW, committed advocate for youth and families, entrepreneur, mild-mannered native Portlander and Oregonian? Or maybe you know Lady Rose, spoken word artist, whose quiet, yet poignant words, share experiences of longing, disappointment, struggle and triumph? Perhap you know one of them, but few know both personalities that embody the soul of this unique being that has chosen be a vessel for change not only through her community work, but also her art.</p>

           SUNDAY, JULY 14TH, 2013
Do you know La Toya A. Hampton, MSW, committed advocate for youth and families, entrepreneur, mild-mannered native Portlander and Oregonian? Or maybe you know Lady Rose, spoken word artist, whose quiet, yet poignant words, share experiences of longing, disappointment, struggle and triumph? Perhap you know one of them, but few know both personalities that embody the soul of this unique being that has chosen be a vessel for change not only through her community work, but also her art.
Up until 2008, La Toya had kept her writings mostly secret with the exception of periodically gifting her pieces to special people whom she felt a special connection.

<p> </p>
<p><br/> Dear Friends,<br/><br/>             I’m really excited to be presenting a new art piece as part of Otherwise Occupied, the only exhibition dedicated exclusively to Palestinian art at the upcoming 55th Venice Biennale, opening May 29th, 2013. As an “unofficial” exhibition in an event otherwise organized along national pavilions, I am thrilled about this opportunity to showcase Palestinian art at this prestigious and highly visible venue for global art attended by an anticipated number of over 370,000 visitors. I am seeking to raise remaining funds necessary to complete the production of my piece, The Trial, totaling $15,000.<br/><br/>             All funds raised will go directly to cover expenses such as the camera crew, sound man, video editor, etc. I could not do this project without your support. Your donation -- large or small -- will help me bring this project to life.<br/><br/> I hope to see you at the exhibition at the 55 Venice biennale!<br/><a href=""http://www.palestineatvenice.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.palestineatvenice.com/</a></p>
<p><br/> Best, <br/> Aissa Deebi<br/><br/> The art project: The Trial<br/> A two-channel installation, HD/DVD 15-minute loop, accompanied by 24 drawings.<br/><br/> This two-channel installation consists of a re-enactment in English of a speech by Daoud Turki, at the Haifa court house in 1973. Where he was a defendant in a military trial. Turki, a Palestinian-Arab citizen of Israel, had been arrested by the Israeli military with four other members of the ""Red Front"" and charged with espionage and collaboration with the enemy. In his speech, Turki tried to advance an idea against the paranoid Zionist fantasy of conflict toward the larger idea of a socialist class struggle, proclaiming solidarity with ""…all workers, peasants and those persecuted in Israeli society."" The brilliance of his rhetoric and the fullness of his reasoned arguments, in which he criticizes Zionism for pitting Jews against Arabs, is caught as an address almost from Franz Kafka's The Trial, echo throughout as the tone of an idealist caught in the jaws of the heinous militaristic state.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This project is an art instructor's vision to raise awareness for special needs artists in Southern California and share their incredible work with the world by producing 1000 museum-quality art books to promote them and the programs that support them. Their creative ability is truly something you have to see to believe!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to produce 1000 copies of a 400-page museum-quality art book to promote these incredible artists and their work. Due to their marginalized status, intellectually disabled artists are often overlooked despite their talents. A thousand copies of this book will go a long way to help put these artists on the map and get them the recognition they deserve.</p>
<p>The cost of publishing 1000 high-quality books is $30,000 USD. These will be distributed to galleries, museum directors and art industry professionals so the world can see the talents of these marginalized artists.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our fundraising goal this time around, the funds will be held in an account while we launch a secondary campaign to reach our goal. We are determined to print this book as we are confident in the astounding quality of our artists’ work. We know it will have a huge impact on their visibility.   </p>
<p>We offer great perks for three different levels of contributions!</p>
<ul>
<li>$25 gets you an original 8x10 print of your choice.</li>
<li>$100 gets you a copy of the book when it is produced.</li>
<li>$1000 gets you a copy of the book when it is produced, as well as one (or more) original pieces of art of your choice, up to a $300 total retail value.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>For artists living with cerebral palsy, seizure disorder and a range of intellectual disabilities such as autism and down syndrome, increased exposure within the community and the art world means a larger audience to view and purchase their art and help them achieve independence, as well as increased fundraising opportunities for the programs that support them. As artist/mentors working these unique individuals, my colleagues and I need all the help we can get. This book has the potential to bring a huge influx of supporters our way.</p>
<p>Founded in 1968 as a branch of the Exceptional Children’s Foundations (ECF), the Art Centers have mentored hundreds of adult artists living with intellectual disabilities. The mission of the program is to give these gifted individuals a vehicle for personal expression and self-sufficiency by encouraging them to pursue careers in fine art. Throughout the years, the Art Centers have been nationally recognized for the personal and professional progress artists within the program have made.</p>
<p><em>“My favorite kind of art is fantasy, because you create what you like. I come [to the Art Center] to do a lot of art. The more you develop your drawings it can help you wage down your anger.

<p>Hello, we are Vanja Contemporary, a carefully curated online art space, representing emerging and promising artists from Europe.</p>
<p>Our mission is to expose the artists' works to a wider audience, to help with the development of their portfolios and to support them to get access to curatorial programmes and the art market. We recently launched our <a href=""http://www.vanjacontemporary.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> and enjoy already a fast growing following in the arts online communities.</p>
<p>This campaign with your contribution will enable us to go beyond the online space and to exhibit our works in a real gallery space in East London, in the first week of October. This we hope will be a launch pad for both the artists' careers and Vanja Contemporary as an arts platform.</p>
<p>An exhibition in an art capital like London is an important step for artists and galleries who want to break through and get there name out in the art world. Your contribution will help us to do this next step! In return we have amazing prints for you as a Thank You and will also invite you to join us at the private view of our show.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Exhibition space in London, framing, insurance and promotion among other exhibition related costs are extremely expensive, and we struggle to pay all costs out of our own pockets.

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are many talented artists who need representation by a gallery in order to be able to show their work to a wider audience. We at Vanja Contemporary are very passionate about the art we are presenting and have great confidence in the success of our artists.</p>
<p>We are looking for donors who share our passion in discovering the new generation of artists and help us in showing their work.

</div></div>","Online Art Space / Amazing Artists / Please Help Us With Our First Exhibition!

Hello, we are Vanja Contemporary, a carefully curated online art space, representing emerging and promising artists from Europe.
Our mission is to expose the artists' works to a wider audience, to help with the development of their portfolios and to support them to get access to curatorial programmes and the art market. We recently launched our website and enjoy already a fast growing following in the arts online communities.
This campaign with your contribution will enable us to go beyond the online space and to exhibit our works in a real gallery space in East London, in the first week of October. This we hope will be a launch pad for both the artists' careers and Vanja Contemporary as an arts platform.
An exhibition in an art capital like London is an important step for artists and galleries who want to break through and get there name out in the art world. Your contribution will help us to do this next step! In return we have amazing prints for you as a Thank You and will also invite you to join us at the private view of our show.

Philipp Haffner: Philipp is a Berlin-based artist who uses drawing as his main medium to compose mind maps of visual signs, associations and meanings, usually retracing them from his memory.
Stefan Mildenberger: Stefan, based in Hamburg, Germany, captures our media saturated world by scanning audio-visual information from TV and other sources and transforming them into abstract prints.

What We Need & What You Get
Exhibition space in London, framing, insurance and promotion among other exhibition related costs are extremely expensive, and we struggle to pay all costs out of our own pockets. However, being artists, we have an amazing range of small prints to offer as a thank you for your contribution. Images of the different works can be found here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/vanja-contemporary/sets/72157634387533599/
See our list of perks for more details.

The Impact
There are many talented artists who need representation by a gallery in order to be able to show their work to a wider audience. We at Vanja Contemporary are very passionate about the art we are presenting and have great confidence in the success of our artists.
We are looking for donors who share our passion in discovering the new generation of artists and help us in showing their work. This will, in the long term, help artists to produce further new art works and to be included in major international art shows. And who knows, it might even be the starting point for you as an art collector!

<p>I have been given the opportunity for a residency in Truth or Consequences in New Mexico to make a site Specific animation. I will drive to Truth or Consequences leaving from Philadelphia beginning January 1st and returning on January 14th.</p>
<p>The project I will work on in New Mexico is part of a larger body of work, spanning from Philadelphia, to Richmond Va. The project, as yet unnamed, is part street art, and part meditative animation. In a nut shell, I will take the local landscape an re-interpret it through an animation. This animation will be accesible for all throug Qr codes and the web.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Mechanical Nun is a robot dressed as a Nun that listens to confessions of sins and creates an interactive graphical representation, the Sin City map of San Francisco. She offers relief from isolating guilt by demonstrating resoundingly that no sinner is alone. To complement the Nun, a Confession Booth provides a private and immersive sensory experience that reacts to the sinner's confession. </p>
<p>The Nun and Booth will start their missionary work at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on November 2nd as part of Project Nunway, a charity fundraiser. The Nun and Booth will also make it to Burning Man, but we don't want to stop there, we want to reach sinners worldwide.  Hence, we're designing an open-source application for broad distribution, to create a searchable library of sins.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>We are raising $6000 to bring the Mechanical Nun and Confession Booth to Project Nunway at the YBCA, they will stay there during the Distopian Futures exhibition, and make it out to Burning Man. The cost is for the materials of the robot the costume, the Confession Booth and its immersive sensory environment. Everything else is being done by volunteers. <p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Isolation and loneliness have become epidemics. Once, traditional support systems such as the church provided avenues for relief. As these support systems crumble within modern society, millions of people suffer from self-imposed guilt without community support. The Mechanical Nun is an art project by-the-people, for-the-people, which strives to ease guilt through transparency. </p>

<p>My name is John Wilson and I'm an artist. I live in Portland Maine and it's here that my life began to percolate. I imagine like many people struggling to find their place in the world I spent years bouncing from one job to the next. I felt disconnected and mostly unhappy in my work and had the nagging suspicion that my life was slipping away without ever finding something that brought me joy and satisfaction. My life turned a corner when I moved to Maine and plugged into Portland's creative economy. I met professional artists who showed me their work and convinced me that this was a viable path. I began to draw again copying animals out of National Geographic Magazines. And I began to move forward. When a friend suggested I apply to art school I thought ""is that allowed?"" But, I went ahead and did it and now at 47 I can't imagine doing anything else.  </p>
<p>After getting my BFA I decided to pursue an MFA with the idea that I would one day teach at the high school or college level. On a recent trip to New York I had my portfolio reviewed by an art professor who suggested before I apply to MFA programs that I work more on my figure drawing and painting skills. So after some research I found this summer program in New York that focuses specifically on interpreting the human figure through drawing, painting and clay modeling. I see this as an opportunity to not only sharpen my technical skills but also get the chance to expand my circle of art contacts who may be able to help me gain a better understanding of how the art world works. I'd be so grateful if you felt moved to contribute something. It'd be a contribution to my life as an artist.</p>
<p>The cost of the program is $3,870. This includes tuition and a student dorm room for one month in July. I'm responsible for food, travel and art supplies <i>which my savings will cover</i>. I've already been offered a $500 scholarship and a very generous contribution from a family member. My goal with IndieGoGo is to raise $2,000 by May 15th which is the residency's deadline for payment.</p>
<p>Shortly following the residency I will have a private opening reception at <a href=""https://www.studiostilllife.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Still Life Studio</a> in Portland, ME where I will show the work I've made and celebrate with all those in the area that have made this possible!</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>About the Book</h3><p>The book is divided into three sections. The first, <i><strong>Political Activist (and Rebel Artist)</strong></i> contains all of my political public art projects from the first half of the 1990s, under the umbrella name <strong>THE X-GIRLFRIENDS</strong>. It showcases most of my political campaigns, visual commentaries, mail-art projects and outdoor billboards covering various social and political topics at the time, such as freedom of expression, the Gulf War, the Bush administration’s unsuccessful drug policies, separation of church and state, and the Catholic Church’s attitude towards AIDS education, among others. As I was going through the work from this time period, I realized that a lot of <strong>the issues featured in this section are unfortunately still topical today, under the current U.S. political climate (and White House administration). It seemed as though we haven’t really moved further at all as a country in the past twenty-five years — the topics are the same and just the name of the players (or politicians) have changed</strong>. And if the book has any context today, it is is simply to expose that very dynamic.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535586330/v7tmayjpt5cf5kts0acm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>This section also includes some of my exhibition work, especially an important “retrospective” installation <strong>Linda (out of context)</strong> at the University of Illinois at Chicago. In it, along with my collaborator at the time Joanne Pandis, I disrupt, and as a result decontextualize, all of my political public art under THE X-GIRLFRIENDS in order to showcase that it belongs in the public sphere rather than on the walls (or pedestals) of an art gallery. I do this in part by casting the political T-shirts and visual commentaries in synthetic resin and thus making them unwearable (and unreadable). In addition, by creating a maze of crowd control stanchions throughout the entire floor of the gallery, I ""manipulate"" viewers and take away their choice of the order in which to experience the exhibition. Yes, I was young and rebellious at the time, and very much against any type of institution, including art ones.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535584452/sydlgf660ffwiovglvbx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The second section, <i><strong>Gender Warrior (and Radical Faerie)</strong></i> contains transitional work, where I turn away from visual public art to writing and performance. Here, I experiment with ""gender-fuck"" drag and tackle queer-specific issues such as sexism within the gay community, as well as the ""Don’t ask, don’t tell"" U.S. military policy. My involvement with the Radical Faerie movement, particularly the EuroFaeries, permeates throughout this work and also includes some large-scale ritualistic performances for... yes — non other than art institutions, such as the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535584910/yzhyfytpb9n28xlvagro.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The last section is dedicated to my performance art character <strong>Malgorzata Romanska</strong>, which I developed in Los Angeles in the mid-2000s. The main concept behind this self-made, wealthy art collector and philanthropist is to give financial power to a character who is normally considered an outcast and on the fringes of society. Then through interactive performances track how the public, and more specifically players in the art world, would respond to her. Until 2012, I embodied and lived as Malgorzata Romanska for days at a time, and attended numerous fundraising auctions and art fairs throughout the U.S. and Europe. As her, I bid at those auctions and bought contemporary art at art galleries at the fairs. <strong>And hopefully in the process, I was also able to change, even in a small way, people’s perception of what a person with financial power and social clout <i>should</i> be and <i>should</i> look like.</strong></p><p>The book contains over 300 images, plus press and archival texts. In it, I tell the stories not only through the main text, but also through various side facts about the projects, thus giving them a more complete context within the political and social milieu of the time. For me, public art and performance can be a dramatic medium that can be employed as a lightning rod for social discourse. And I hope that this personal creative journey informs, intrigues, stirs up thoughts (even if uncomfortable ones), and inspires you, in your own way, to be an active participant in our democracies, both in the United States, as well as worldwide. <strong>But most importantly, it encourages you to get out and VOTE!</strong></p><p>The official book release date is <strong>November 6, 2018</strong> — the day of the crucial mid-term elections in the United States.</p><p><strong>BOOK SPECS:</strong></p><p><strong><i>Kulov 90–15: Twenty-Five Years of Political Public Art and Performances</i> </strong>will be available in three different versions:<br/><strong>Digital</strong> &gt; Each digital version of the book will come in two types of PDFs. One consists of spreads, so it's just like a printed book. And the other is of single pages, which is better to view/read on iPads or other such tablet/mobile devices.<strong> $35</strong><br/><strong>Hard Cover</strong> &gt; 8 x 10 inches (20 x 25 cm), 100-pound premium matte paper, 122 pages; imagewrap, soft-touch, matte-coated cover. It includes the digital version of the book. <strong>$95</strong><br/><strong>Limited Edition</strong> &gt; 8 x 10 inches (20 x 25 cm), 100-pound eggshell texture uncoated paper, 122 pages; dark gray linen hard cover with hand-glued image, plus partial dust jacket; signed and numbered in an edition of 12 (plus 3 artist's proofs). It also includes the digital version. <strong>$150</strong></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Why Do I Need Funding?</strong></h3><p>The printed book is going to be available through on-demand printing, which allows me not to have to front the funds for the printing part of it. But at the same time, this raises up the cost per book tremendously. It also doesn't allow for having a wholesale price, which means that bookstores would not be able to carry it. Therefore, I would have to sell the book on my own and at cost in order to make it affordable for everyone — hence, there will be no profits from the sales. However, a book has many other expenses besides printing, such as <strong>editorial and design/production fees, photo retouching, print tests, PR, marketing, and many more</strong>. So this crowdfunding campaign would hopefully cover some of those costs. And if I'm able to raise even more than my campaign goal, the funds would be allocated towards a book launch event and even a retrospective exhibition down the line.</p><p><strong>RISK AND CHALLENGES</strong><br/>As some of your already know, I've been in a retrospective mood for some time — this is my third such book in just the past four years. So I've done this before, and it would be absolutely no problem for me to complete this book project as well.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>About the Perks/Rewards</strong></h3><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535695527/tbzlg47kkbstrcd2efiu.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong>THE BOOKMARK</strong><br/>The <strong>Kulov 90–15 Bookmark</strong> is under the <strong>ART PACIFIST</strong> perk, but also under a lot of the other perks in this campaign.

The first, Political Activist (and Rebel Artist) contains all of my political public art projects from the first half of the 1990s, under the umbrella name THE X-GIRLFRIENDS. It showcases most of my political campaigns, visual commentaries, mail-art projects and outdoor billboards covering various social and political topics at the time, such as freedom of expression, the Gulf War, the Bush administration’s unsuccessful drug policies, separation of church and state, and the Catholic Church’s attitude towards AIDS education, among others. As I was going through the work from this time period, I realized that a lot of the issues featured in this section are unfortunately still topical today, under the current U.S. political climate (and White House administration). It seemed as though we haven’t really moved further at all as a country in the past twenty-five years — the topics are the same and just the name of the players (or politicians) have changed. And if the book has any context today, it is is simply to expose that very dynamic.This section also includes some of my exhibition work, especially an important “retrospective” installation Linda (out of context) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. In it, along with my collaborator at the time Joanne Pandis, I disrupt, and as a result decontextualize, all of my political public art under THE X-GIRLFRIENDS in order to showcase that it belongs in the public sphere rather than on the walls (or pedestals) of an art gallery. I do this in part by casting the political T-shirts and visual commentaries in synthetic resin and thus making them unwearable (and unreadable). In addition, by creating a maze of crowd control stanchions throughout the entire floor of the gallery, I ""manipulate"" viewers and take away their choice of the order in which to experience the exhibition. Yes, I was young and rebellious at the time, and very much against any type of institution, including art ones.The second section, Gender Warrior (and Radical Faerie) contains transitional work, where I turn away from visual public art to writing and performance. Here, I experiment with ""gender-fuck"" drag and tackle queer-specific issues such as sexism within the gay community, as well as the ""Don’t ask, don’t tell"" U.S. military policy. My involvement with the Radical Faerie movement, particularly the EuroFaeries, permeates throughout this work and also includes some large-scale ritualistic performances for... yes — non other than art institutions, such as the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.The last section is dedicated to my performance art character Malgorzata Romanska, which I developed in Los Angeles in the mid-2000s. The main concept behind this self-made, wealthy art collector and philanthropist is to give financial power to a character who is normally considered an outcast and on the fringes of society. Then through interactive performances track how the public, and more specifically players in the art world, would respond to her. Until 2012, I embodied and lived as Malgorzata Romanska for days at a time, and attended numerous fundraising auctions and art fairs throughout the U.S. and Europe. As her, I bid at those auctions and bought contemporary art at art galleries at the fairs. And hopefully in the process, I was also able to change, even in a small way, people’s perception of what a person with financial power and social clout should be and should look like.The book contains over 300 images, plus press and archival texts. In it, I tell the stories not only through the main text, but also through various side facts about the projects, thus giving them a more complete context within the political and social milieu of the time. For me, public art and performance can be a dramatic medium that can be employed as a lightning rod for social discourse. And I hope that this personal creative journey informs, intrigues, stirs up thoughts (even if uncomfortable ones), and inspires you, in your own way, to be an active participant in our democracies, both in the United States, as well as worldwide. But most importantly, it encourages you to get out and VOTE!The official book release date is November 6, 2018 — the day of the crucial mid-term elections in the United States.BOOK SPECS:Kulov 90–15: Twenty-Five Years of Political Public Art and Performances will be available in three different versions:Digital > Each digital version of the book will come in two types of PDFs. One consists of spreads, so it's just like a printed book. And the other is of single pages, which is better to view/read on iPads or other such tablet/mobile devices. $35Hard Cover > 8 x 10 inches (20 x 25 cm), 100-pound premium matte paper, 122 pages; imagewrap, soft-touch, matte-coated cover. It includes the digital version of the book. $95Limited Edition > 8 x 10 inches (20 x 25 cm), 100-pound eggshell texture uncoated paper, 122 pages; dark gray linen hard cover with hand-glued image, plus partial dust jacket; signed and numbered in an edition of 12 (plus 3 artist's proofs). It also includes the digital version. $150 Why Do I Need Funding?The printed book is going to be available through on-demand printing, which allows me not to have to front the funds for the printing part of it. But at the same time, this raises up the cost per book tremendously. It also doesn't allow for having a wholesale price, which means that bookstores would not be able to carry it. Therefore, I would have to sell the book on my own and at cost in order to make it affordable for everyone — hence, there will be no profits from the sales. However, a book has many other expenses besides printing, such as editorial and design/production fees, photo retouching, print tests, PR, marketing, and many more. So this crowdfunding campaign would hopefully cover some of those costs. And if I'm able to raise even more than my campaign goal, the funds would be allocated towards a book launch event and even a retrospective exhibition down the line.RISK AND CHALLENGESAs some of your already know, I've been in a retrospective mood for some time — this is my third such book in just the past four years. So I've done this before, and it would be absolutely no problem for me to complete this book project as well. About the Perks/RewardsTHE BOOKMARKThe Kulov 90–15 Bookmark is under the ART PACIFIST perk, but also under a lot of the other perks in this campaign. Whenever I have full control over the shipping of a perk, I'd be able to send it to you. You can also request to add it to a perk, for which it's not currently listed.THE BUTTON/BADGEThe Separation of Church & State Button/Badge (1.5 x 1.5 inches > 4 x 4 cm) is under the ART HUMANIST perk. It is not a reprint, but the original from the 1994 campaign — I had saved quite a few for the archive, and there are currently only ten available. This is my last such political public art campaign, which currently appears on pages 38–39 of the Kulov 90–15 book.THE BOOKThe Kulov 90–15 Book is of course the main perk/reward of this crowdfunding campaign. The digital version of it is under the ART ACTIVIST perk, but also under a lot of the other perks in the campaign. And as I mentioned above, it also comes with the printed versions of the book — the hard cover which is under the ART RADICAL perk, and the limited edition which is under ART ANARCHIST. Check for book specs above.THE PRINTThe Limited Edition Print (6 x 9 inches > 15 x 23 cm) of the Knowledge Is Power performance art project, 2008–2011, is under the ART WARRIOR perk. It is printed on a 32-point card stock with orange color edges, signed and numbered on the back in an edition of ten. This is actually the same print which is hand-glued to the linen cover of the limited-edition version of the Kulov 90–15 book.THE BILLBOARDThis mini-reproduction of the One of These Things Is Just Like the Others... Outdoor Billboard (72 x 18 inches  > 178 x 46 cm) is under the ART REVOLUTIONARY perk. It is printed on vinyl with optional grommets, and is signed and numbered on the back in an edition of ten. The original project was produced in 1992 with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The actual billboard is 48 x 14 feet (15 x 4 m) and was vandalized ten days into its display at a strategic location in Chicago. The full story is on pages 24–27 of the Kulov 90–15 book.THE OTHER BOOKThe Kulov 90–00: A Decade of Transformation (6.75 x 8.5 inches > 17 x 22 cm), limited-edition, hand-made artist's book is under the last perk/reward ART SUPERHERO. It was released in 2001 and covers my projects during the 1990s (basically the first two sections of Kulov 90–15).

</p><p>“A
miraculous compound, it is the primary source and vivifying factor of all
sustenance and, by extension, all life as we know it...Water has the power to
purify: to restore and replenish life to our essential, spiritual selves.”
(Slonim)</p>
<p>For centuries, water has been used as
an integral part of religious rituals for different faiths throughout the
world. These rituals are often performed in the public eye so that many can
witness them. However, in the Jewish faith, there is one private ritual for a
woman that involves immersion in a special pool of water, called a mikvah.
Mikvah literally means ‘a collection’; in this case, a place which has
collected a specially prescribed type of water. This water is intended to
purify the body before marriage and on a monthly basis for married women. Due
to its private nature, ritual immersion is rarely discussed and the physical
spaces of these baths have not been exposed to the public.</p>
<p>The mikvah has many layers of
significance, connecting generations of Jewish women. I have created a body of
work that sheds light on both the traditional and modern beauty of the mikvah.
While modern-day mikvahs resemble a miniature swimming pool or hot tub, some of
them appear more humble, while others are more opulent. I have photographed
eight different mikvahs in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada, underlining the
similarities and differences of the spaces.</p>
<p>This photographic project is meant to respectfully offer insight
into this private ritual.  The prints are divided into three categories: <i>Tradition,
Preparation, </i>and<i> Purification</i>. The first part, <i>Tradition</i>,
contains portraits of individual, observant Jewish women. While showing modesty
with respect to the subject matter, each woman’s identity is hidden and each
covers her hair in some way, according to religious tradition. These portraits
have a slight blue cast, signifying the water in the mikvah. In the second portion, <i>Preparation</i>, one can find objects used to prepare for the ritual
immersion. The tools rest on silk and are elevated in significance from their
typical banality. These photographs are faintly toned red, signifying the
impurity before entering the mikvah. Within the last section, <i>Purification</i>,
there are various images of the interior spaces of the mikvah. In this part,
the photographs depict the mikvah itself as well as, surrounding rooms and
details. These images have a minor yellow hue, reminiscent of sepia-toned
historic images, emphasizing the continuity of this tradition through the
generations.</p>

What is Squaring the Circle: Llano del Rio?

Squaring the Circle is an interdisciplinary arts exhibition planned
for Saturday, May 3rd, 2014 that will feature site-specific installations and
performances to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Llano del Rio
Cooperative Colony, a utopian socialist community established in 1914 by Job Harriman
in Southern California’s Antelope Valley. Like the original Llano community,
the event participants reflect diversity in their work as historians, visual
artists, filmmakers, writers, choreographers, dancers, musicians, activists,
and interdisciplinary practitioners. 
We are seeking your help to fund this unique desert collaboration
that will feature:
Temporary installations by Jessica Cowley & Lyra
Kilston, Michelle Rozic, Karyl Newman, Larissa Nickel, Minna Phillips, and Stacey
Spiegel
Performances by LA Art Girls, Olivia de Haulleville, Rachel
Finkelstein, Kate Hoffman, Jennifer from JC Penney, Elizabeth Leister, Opera
del Espacio, Linda Ravenswood, Semi-Tropic Spiritualists, Leora Wien, and
SuarezDanceTheater
Film screenings by Judy Branfman and Mady Schutzman
And historical walking tours lead by Dr. Dydia
DeLyser and Paul Greenstein co-author of the book Bread and Hyacinths: The
Rise and Fall of Utopian Los Angeles.


Proposed project by the Semi-Tropic Spiritualists

</p><p>This is a coloring book. One hundred pages of fairies, in
random moments of their lives, all with their wings blank so that you can
design their wings the way you think they ought to be designed.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/356351/files/20140207172938-abstract-fairy.jpg?1391822978"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, my name is Eleanor Begley, and I am the illustrator of
this project. (I’m also the illustrator of<a href=""http://www.gamergnome.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> this comic </a>and the owner of <a href=""http://fevley.deviantart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this deviantART page</a>, for background’s sake.) The idea of making a coloring book has
been bouncing around in my head for ages, ever since I outgrew the simple
Garfield coloring books and started to really admire how colors went into other,
more intense comic strips. How did the colorists know what to do? Did they all
start out with Garfield kicking Odie? Did they shade those? Or were those too
simplistic?</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/356352/files/20140207173004-accomplice-fairy.jpg?1391823004"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case, what could I do better? Could I do it at all?
And, why fairies?</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/356353/files/20140207173029-hibernaculum-fairy.jpg?1391823029"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, why so many fairies? They’re not even really
doing typical fairy stuff, like frolicking with flowers or pestering people.
Why fairies? Well, why not? My personal goal for this was to have fun, and
drawing one hundred fairies is fun for maybe the first sixty, then you gotta go
with some strange pictures.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/356354/files/20140207173054-oeillade-fairy.jpg?1391823054"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, see, this is why this coloring book is for kids AND
adults. Super-buff-vain-macho fairy isn’t going to be funny to little kids.
This one might:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/356355/files/20140207173117-accordian-fairy.jpg?1391823077"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>All of their wings have been left blank. Why? It wasn’t me
being lazy. It was me wondering what people would do if given permission to be
as creative as they want in a silly setting. It was me thinking that would be
fun. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>What Is Needed</strong></p><p>The goal for this project is $600, and that is because
printing books is not cheap, nor is shipping them. A small book print run of
this coloring book would cost around $450, and the cheapest shipping costs $2.50
for each individual book.</p>
<p>The main goal of this, however, is not just the printing of
books: it’s the spreading of fairies. Every reward tier $8 and above gets the
PDF, whether or not the goal is reached. With the PDF, you can print off pages
of fairies as often as you’d like.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/356356/files/20140207173156-accord-fairy.jpg?1391823116"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>Woo-hoo! Some of the rewards include multiple books, and
some of them include artwork by me, like 2.5”x3.5” ACEOs. Here’s an example of
one:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/356357/files/20140207173228-ACEO_Eleanor_lab.JPG?1391823148"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</p><br/></div>","The Project
This is a coloring book. One hundred pages of fairies, in
random moments of their lives, all with their wings blank so that you can
design their wings the way you think they ought to be designed.

Hi, my name is Eleanor Begley, and I am the illustrator of
this project. (I’m also the illustrator of this comic and the owner of this deviantART page, for background’s sake.) The idea of making a coloring book has
been bouncing around in my head for ages, ever since I outgrew the simple
Garfield coloring books and started to really admire how colors went into other,
more intense comic strips. How did the colorists know what to do? Did they all
start out with Garfield kicking Odie? Did they shade those? Or were those too
simplistic?

In that case, what could I do better? Could I do it at all?
And, why fairies?

Seriously, why so many fairies? They’re not even really
doing typical fairy stuff, like frolicking with flowers or pestering people.
Why fairies? Well, why not? My personal goal for this was to have fun, and
drawing one hundred fairies is fun for maybe the first sixty, then you gotta go
with some strange pictures.

Yeah, see, this is why this coloring book is for kids AND
adults. Super-buff-vain-macho fairy isn’t going to be funny to little kids.
This one might:

All of their wings have been left blank. Why? It wasn’t me
being lazy. It was me wondering what people would do if given permission to be
as creative as they want in a silly setting. It was me thinking that would be
fun. That’s all.
What Is NeededThe goal for this project is $600, and that is because
printing books is not cheap, nor is shipping them. A small book print run of
this coloring book would cost around $450, and the cheapest shipping costs $2.50
for each individual book.
The main goal of this, however, is not just the printing of
books: it’s the spreading of fairies. Every reward tier $8 and above gets the
PDF, whether or not the goal is reached. With the PDF, you can print off pages
of fairies as often as you’d like.

Woo-hoo! Some of the rewards include multiple books, and
some of them include artwork by me, like 2.5”x3.5” ACEOs. Here’s an example of
one:

Whoa, color! Here’s another one, just for kicks:

By choosing to buy an
ACEO, you’ve chosen to get a random and probably very silly card through the
mail. For something specific (not to mention bigger), commission options are
sprinkled through the reward tiers. Contact me through IndieGoGo or at write2me@gamergnome.com (I know, a
very silly address) if you choose this reward tier, although I will probably
contact you first. Various size options of original art are on the reward tier
descriptions.
Now, what will happen if the goal is not reached? Everybody
will get a PDF and any art they bought, of course. The closer we get to the
goal, the more likely we can get the book printed. I will keep everybody
apprised of the situation. If a tiny print run, just enough to get everybody
the book, can be done, then that is what will be done.
Naturally, if the goal is reached, everybody will get what
they bought. Woo-hoo!
If the goal is exceeded, stretch goals are in order!
Woo-hoo! This is the only stretch goal I can think of for this project:
$1100: One hundred more fairies added, making it a two
hundred page coloring book!
Any suggestions made for further stretch goals should that one
be exceeded will be deeply appreciated.
What Else You Can Do To HelpAnother thing that would be deeply appreciated is

<p>THE SHOW</p>
<p>""You will be Scarlett O 'Hara"". How many people in the world have been told this phrase? Only one: Vivien Leigh. And then? What happened next? You may say: she shot the film, of course. But let’s step back in the middle of time: what happened an hour after the proposal? Two hours after? How did she and how did Larry react to the news? What happens to a couple when one of the two is going to have his big chance? And what kind of “plans” a woman in her private life is forced to abandon to fill a career in the movies?</p>
<p>To be or not to be Scarlett O 'Hara tackles, with imagination, the moment immediately following the Christmas dinner of 1938 at first director-in-charge of Gone With The Wind George Cukor’s house. In the biography by Donald Spoto about Laurence Olivier it’s told that, while dining, Cukor took Vivien apart and announced she had been chosen for the role and then everyone was happy for her ""except, maybe, Larry"". In this single act we meet the two famous actors after dinner in their hotel room dealing with the crisis that a precious chance such as interpreting the eternal role of Scarlett produces on a pair. Just when the couple seems to find a balance, an unforeseen trouble comes out.</p>
<p>Man, as male individual, still struggles to accept women’s success. It is not a problem of times but rather cultural. As the Hollywood industry passed on feelings like a steamroller, so today the craving for self-affirmation, economic stability and success is threatening lovers’ peace. And actually, as in this comedy, it is the job’s world, with its strict and cold rules, to make decisions for us. ""To be or not to be"" was Hamlet's torment. Vivien’s. Or anybody’s.</p>

<p><strong>About the <i>Brass Ring</i> Project</strong></p>
<p>This lengthy overview of contemporary blockbuster cinema  began during my study at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, nearly ten years ago, picked up momentum during my (brief) study at Saint Andrews, and has continued to its present state: some 700 pages (depending on formatting), and over 600 footnotes. Now that it's finished, I'm extending this new call for support to get it published, in both print and e-book formats.</p>
<p>The book explores cinema's recent transition from analog to digital formats – and the resulting changes to film viewing, production, and interactivity – using the modern movie blockbuster (e.g., James Cameron's <i>Titanic</i>, George Lucas's <i>Star Wars</i>), as well as the video ""remix"" and ""fan-edit,"" as signal illustrations of these changes. A number of significant releases from earlier eras (e.g., Hitchcock's <i>Vertigo</i>, Chaplin's <i>The Gold Rush</i>) are also examined, making the study, in part, an attempt to assess mainstream cinema's trajectory and current state, in terms of form, genre, and presence in the lives of consumers. Another key element of the project is the digital ""revision"" of Jacques Tourneur's <i>Night of the Demon </i>(1957) and Peter Jackson's <i>Lord of the Rings</i> films (2001-2003), using formalist principles of continuity, economy, and balance, á la classical Hollywood. The purpose of these ancillary video projects, done in tandem with the book's writing, has been to better understand and define certain box-office driven, aesthetically blinkered shifts in film narrative and technology of the past several decades; or, more simply, to clarify how contemporary cinema's commercial pressures take cultural form, in feature film product. </p>
<p><strong>Why Focus on the Blockbuster?</strong></p>
<p>If the study is broad enough to consider ""cinema's trajectory,"" why should it focus on the modern blockbuster, as opposed to major movie hits of the past (e.g., <i>Gone with the Wind</i>)? </p>
<p>I've chosen this particular variety of Hollywood product because it so effectively represents – as well as precipitating – recent, profound changes in the way films are made and regarded. The blockbuster is also a useful gauge of cultural tastes generally, because it exerts a tremendous pull on the consumer at large, whether offered in music, print, or film formats. The emergence of a hit-defying, abundantly diversified digital marketplace, matching unique, individual taste with unique, small-scale titles, has so far been proven false by the market-share for music downloads and video rentals/purchases (as shown by Anita Elberse).  Despite the Internet’s broadened range of merchants and media, the most active consumers are still guided by a sweet tooth for trend and bestsellers – i.e., what others appear to be buying – gravitating toward stars and major releases to define their cultural diet, and culture itself.  </p>
<p><strong>What I Need to Self-Publish</strong></p>
<p>The process of design, layout, review, printing, and marketing for publication (through Minneapolis' Mill City Press), will cost $7,581</p>
<p>This total reflects basic registration, formatting, and production of the book ($1,200), the enormity of the text (an additional $2500), manuscript evaluation ($600), front and back covers ($750), photography fees ($500), enhanced formatting for tables and illustrations ($200), copyright registration ($50), print-on-demand distribution and returns management ($600), exposure on Amazon.com ($500), a bookstore selling sheet w/meta-data on the publication ($100), and an independent review from Kirkus ($575)</p>
<p><strong>Why is the goal of this campaign only $1,100?</strong></p>
<p>Because of the initial campaign, and support from an outside (as yet anonymous) donor, the amount needed has fallen precipitously! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Project's Impact</strong></p>
<p>Thus far, no film reception study or work of film criticism has taken the practical, studio-based approach that this project has, in which the filmic material examined is variously dismantled and rebuilt (editorially), revealing latent strengths and significations of form. For its demonstration of a unique mode of film analysis – using exceptionally popular titles as subject matter – the potential influence and appeal of the project is considerable. Moreover, despite growing scholarship on fan culture, and a surge in user-altered commercial content (e.g., songs, films, literature, television programs and characters) concurrent with the proliferation of digital media, there has been no comprehensive study of how such content can be re-worked, by consumers, for mass consumption. The reasons for this concern various restrictions of market and venue. Popular sites like Vimeo and Youtube guard against remixed commercial content that isn't sufficiently ""transformed"" by the consumer-editor, and for good reason. No major record label or film studio wants their property modified and resold by consumers (particularly if the property is made more appealing than its release version), and even if the altered material is distributed for free, its public consumption naturally cuts into artist royalties and producer revenue.</p>
<p>But what of the remixer/re-editor who distributes material for altruistic – e.g., artistic – reasons? The question of piracy becomes murky when education and aesthetics is brought into play, as a motivating cause and purpose of revised material; as seen, for example, in Mike J. Nichols's <i>The Phantom Edit</i>, and Christian Marclay's <i>The Clock</i> (neither of which have incurred legal penalties for their use of protected source material). If such celebrated works become more common – as seems possible, if not likely – how might they affect concepts of authorship, ownership, criticism, and industry power? Though copyrighted material tends to be remixed or re-edited for individual rather than public use, is it possible to develop a new regard for the moving image, a regard both critical and creative, that favors social and communal reception of cultural products? Might visual culture benefit from a more considered film consumption, by viewers who not only possess the tools to produce and alter content, but who can also employ a relevant, relatable aesthetic – an aesthetic born of their capacity for fragmenting, replaying, and manipulating commercial material?</p>
<p>When people have asked me who this book is written for, I describe a digitally-fluent consumer of popular culture, preferably with a basic knowledge of film terms (e.g., ""dissolve,"" ""fade-out,"" ""close-up""), who also moonlights – at least occasionally – as a cultural producer. Few young readers would escape this description, yet when I consider the cultural and technological fluency of my students (most of whom are in their twenties), I'm surprised by how rare the critical eye is. Preferences and aversions are readily expressed, but most are at a loss to explain the mechanics of their visual pleasure, distaste, and so forth. For so many fellow consumers I speak to, in and beyond the classroom, it's as if a dividing blade has been dropped, by the binary ""rotten""/""fresh,"" ""like""/""dislike"" structuring of digital life. If the ease of image-making, access, and manipulation has produced too many options relative to one's capacity to discern, decipher, or communicate through moving images, then a pause for reflection seems in order. We might then reconsider some of cinema's most effective and problematic output, not through an endlessly discursive analysis of possible significations and personal tastes, but through a more neutral  examination of the basic elements of form and style. At this stage in the evolution of motion picture narrative, a formalist lens may be the most useful to consumers, for their creative as well as critical capacities. My hope for <i>Brass Ring</i> is that it offers not only theoretical grist for students of film, or mere critique of a handful of influential blockbusters, but a practical guide for moviegoers generally – a path forward for feature film making and appreciation in the Digital Age. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Five Excerpts from <i>Brass Ring</i></strong></p>
<p>Chapter excerpt: The Latest Marvel (on the superhero film)</p>
<p>... ""The trend in taste and product ramps ever upward in visuality, aurality, and often tone (e.g., from whimsical to peremptory). At least stylistically, the unfortunate formal consequences of this shift can be seen in Frank Miller’s monstrous noir-fantasy The Spirit (2008), an abysmally dark, perversely over-produced translation of more playful, colorful source material (Will Eisner’s titular newspaper strip [1940-1952]). To be clear, the failing of Miller’s film is not in its pictorial or thematic “darkness” so much as its desperately playful accenting,  when the ludic nature of the original strip – a combination of fluid artwork, pulp surrealism, and parodic undercurrent – could scarcely translate to big budget, live-action form; the cost of such grandly-scaled artifice is simply too great for so light a spirit, and the guiltless delight its expression elicits. Though more palatable, Luc Besson’s equally “playful” live-action fantasy The Adventures of Adèle Blanc-Sec (2010) reflects the same delusion of contemporary digital cinema, spending an estimated twenty-five million euros to reify – without improving on or capturing the sprightly intrigue of – its comic book source. (Note that Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s cartoonish action comedy Micmacs a tire-larigot, released six months earlier and produced for about the same amount, suffers no such withering comparison. The soufflé holds. Despite its obvious nostalgia and epic, action-fantasy form, it appears freshly conceived and executed, in part because its digital identity is restricted to color grading and background work, but also because its somewhat anachronistic, slapstick action is leveraged with immediate, real-world concerns; in particular arms manufacturers and the consequences of their products’ global distribution.) This doesn’t mean form can’t overcome material strictures, but the shadow of economics can lie heavily on the act and object of art. The litheness of a bird in flight may be captured in stone, as Brancusi demonstrated with L’Oiseau dans l’espace, but append a $27 million purchase price and the work is made to bear an almost supernatural weight. The blockbuster production that “puts its money on the screen,” as Miller’s The Spirit does to such clear and distasteful effect, bears an even greater burden in its effort to take flight and justify its evident expense."" ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chapter excerpt: Dreaming of a Creative Spectatorship (on Méliès and Scorsese's Hugo)</p>
<p>... ""From the earliest projections of the Lumières and the Lathams, to the most advanced practical effects work of Industrial Light and Magic, cinema has demonstrated a profound and spectacular connection with the world outside that of cinematic illusion, as it appears on screen in purely visual form. In her formal analysis of Hugo’s use of stereoscopic space, Purse reveals the nuanced visual sensibility Scorsese brings to the production, distinguishing it from so many major releases conceived and shot in digital 3D. What this thoughtful reading seems to avoid is the film’s overwhelmingly visual character and excessively tight choreography, suggesting an overwound watch; every element of the narrative is graphically represented, unambiguously, and these elements – including the illusion of spatial depth (an “articulation of cinematic space” only in the crudest sense) – are very often computer-generated. The precisely controlled, virtualized figure and/or setting may function as a neutral tool of art, but where the virtual mise en scène prevails in the live-action context, the non-virtual is slighted. To claim that the city or open ocean as reflected in the eye of the camera is no more valuable to cinema than its digital substitute – and perhaps less so for its restive nature – is another form of slight. The same applies to film fantasy when grounded in the live. Seeing Jean Marais’s beast, cocooned in make-up with only his eyes exposed,  one might argue that the weight of the character/creature’s gaze, playing between the who and the what, is simply an artful trick of the medium; a surreal effect of masking, amplified and forced to evolve by the close-up. But there can be no question a living actor moved beneath each strand of fur and thread of costuming – that their eyes once shone before the lens (and no less the eyes of Marais, who suffered the elaborate prosthetics, embodied beauty and beast, and initially suggested the adaptation to Cocteau). Even in the busier, more extreme féerieabstractions of Méliès, the same grounding is evident, and it wasn’t placed there out of fealty to classical theater or the veristic. Though the popular image of Méliès has gained a certain luster and originary status by his place in film history, his goals were chiefly amusement and fantasy spectacle. Whatever realism exists in Méliès’s work exists as a characteristic of live-action production – of practical and quite mundane means – but also because his scenarios were recorded on </p>
<p>photochemical emulsion, with occasional in-camera effects – effects that relied on the profilmic. As an illusionist of the stage and screen he had no obligation to or particular interest in film’s full mimetic capacities, outside its improvement of the live magic act and suggestion of fantastic persons, creatures, and locales (e.g., the Sun, Moon, hell, the North Pole) – again, primarily as astonishing sights, not as autonomous subjects that existed outside the picture plane, or grew past this visual stricture through artistic maturation (as in the work of contemporary Louis Feuillade)."" ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chapter excerpt: Bigness as Disaster (on filmic excess and amendment)</p>
<p>...""Critically viewing a disaster-romance on the order of Titanic – in which excess defines the picture – or Michael Cimino’s infamously outsized Heaven’s Gate (1980), or the sometimes meandering Nashville (d. Robert Altman, 1972) – in which the drawling pace is largely the point – there may in certain passages be a desire for trimming, but no clear sense of how much. Taking a hand in a feature by attempting to amend it, by digital means, the critical enterprise can assume a finer, more formal dimension, allowing one to better understand what material disserves the film, and how much of it to excise. One may also find that no cutting, however deep or fine, will improve Cameron’s Titanic or Cimino’s Heaven’s Gate. In other titles considered for revision, technical and/or aesthetic problems encountered in certain key shots, lines of dialogue, effects work and so on must be allowed their unfortunate influence, for removing such blemishes would in some cases seriously injure or kill the organism of the film, calling to mind the figure of Georgiana (in Hawthorne’s “The Birth-Mark”), whose husband chemically dissolves a hand-shaped birthmark on her cheek, only to watch her die as the mark fades. Complicating matters, the aesthetic dilemmas and obstacles that face the consumer-revised film are often exterior to the works themselves (apart from the perennial problem of tunnel vision in revisions conducted by a single </p>
<p>editor).Thinning a largely unnecessary forty-minute lead-up to Skull Island in Peter Jackson’s King Kong (2005) seems a sensible choice, and would resolve at least some of the project’s indulgent character – assuming this is desirable, and the film’s role as document of mounting hubris is set aside – but the victory of improvement by streamlining would still be diminished by the presence of a more economical, agile treatment of the same material in the 1933 version. The original, potentially originary nature of other, less celebrated titles suggests a stronger cause for reform. For example, elimination of the monster visuals in Night of the Demon (d. Jacques Tourneur, 1957) not only produces a deeper, more disturbing impression of the supernatural, the absence of the controversial shots – which are fairly easily excised without affect to flow – brings the viewer closer to the cast and crew’s best artistic intentions."" ... </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chapter excerpt: The Source's Apprentice (on Marclay's The Clock)</p>
<p>... ""The Clock’s often marvelous, unexpected flow is due to careful use of split edits at almost every turn, while visual and conceptual motifs also serve to unify the disparate source material. Clip length varies greatly, but tends toward staccato cutting at the top of each hour – noon and midnight being among the most spectacular (and best attended). I expected the piece to require an elaborate playback system with multiple synched hard drives, but as Marclay explained to me on the closing night of one museum engagement, “I actually managed to fit the whole thing on a Mac mini, but the new one, the one without any moving parts.”  The solid state drive and player suggests one of The Clock’s most alluring aspects: the miraculous capacity to contain what appears to be – at least at first glance – a clock-themed survey of the whole of cinema, using current PC technology and an elegantly simple, exacting, yet profoundly inclusive editing formula. It should be noted, however, that few museum-goers are likely to devote more than a few hours to the piece; fewer still its full cycle. The impression of a “profoundly inclusive,” </p>

</div></div>","About the Brass Ring Project
This lengthy overview of contemporary blockbuster cinema  began during my study at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, nearly ten years ago, picked up momentum during my (brief) study at Saint Andrews, and has continued to its present state: some 700 pages (depending on formatting), and over 600 footnotes. Now that it's finished, I'm extending this new call for support to get it published, in both print and e-book formats.
The book explores cinema's recent transition from analog to digital formats – and the resulting changes to film viewing, production, and interactivity – using the modern movie blockbuster (e.g., James Cameron's Titanic, George Lucas's Star Wars), as well as the video ""remix"" and ""fan-edit,"" as signal illustrations of these changes. A number of significant releases from earlier eras (e.g., Hitchcock's Vertigo, Chaplin's The Gold Rush) are also examined, making the study, in part, an attempt to assess mainstream cinema's trajectory and current state, in terms of form, genre, and presence in the lives of consumers. Another key element of the project is the digital ""revision"" of Jacques Tourneur's Night of the Demon (1957) and Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films (2001-2003), using formalist principles of continuity, economy, and balance, á la classical Hollywood. The purpose of these ancillary video projects, done in tandem with the book's writing, has been to better understand and define certain box-office driven, aesthetically blinkered shifts in film narrative and technology of the past several decades; or, more simply, to clarify how contemporary cinema's commercial pressures take cultural form, in feature film product. 
Why Focus on the Blockbuster?
If the study is broad enough to consider ""cinema's trajectory,"" why should it focus on the modern blockbuster, as opposed to major movie hits of the past (e.g., Gone with the Wind)? 
I've chosen this particular variety of Hollywood product because it so effectively represents – as well as precipitating – recent, profound changes in the way films are made and regarded. The blockbuster is also a useful gauge of cultural tastes generally, because it exerts a tremendous pull on the consumer at large, whether offered in music, print, or film formats. The emergence of a hit-defying, abundantly diversified digital marketplace, matching unique, individual taste with unique, small-scale titles, has so far been proven false by the market-share for music downloads and video rentals/purchases (as shown by Anita Elberse).  Despite the Internet’s broadened range of merchants and media, the most active consumers are still guided by a sweet tooth for trend and bestsellers – i.e., what others appear to be buying – gravitating toward stars and major releases to define their cultural diet, and culture itself.  
What I Need to Self-Publish
The process of design, layout, review, printing, and marketing for publication (through Minneapolis' Mill City Press), will cost $7,581
This total reflects basic registration, formatting, and production of the book ($1,200), the enormity of the text (an additional $2500), manuscript evaluation ($600), front and back covers ($750), photography fees ($500), enhanced formatting for tables and illustrations ($200), copyright registration ($50), print-on-demand distribution and returns management ($600), exposure on Amazon.com ($500), a bookstore selling sheet w/meta-data on the publication ($100), and an independent review from Kirkus ($575)
Why is the goal of this campaign only $1,100?
Because of the initial campaign, and support from an outside (as yet anonymous) donor, the amount needed has fallen precipitously! 
 
The Project's Impact
Thus far, no film reception study or work of film criticism has taken the practical, studio-based approach that this project has, in which the filmic material examined is variously dismantled and rebuilt (editorially), revealing latent strengths and significations of form. For its demonstration of a unique mode of film analysis – using exceptionally popular titles as subject matter – the potential influence and appeal of the project is considerable. Moreover, despite growing scholarship on fan culture, and a surge in user-altered commercial content (e.g., songs, films, literature, television programs and characters) concurrent with the proliferation of digital media, there has been no comprehensive study of how such content can be re-worked, by consumers, for mass consumption. The reasons for this concern various restrictions of market and venue. Popular sites like Vimeo and Youtube guard against remixed commercial content that isn't sufficiently ""transformed"" by the consumer-editor, and for good reason. No major record label or film studio wants their property modified and resold by consumers (particularly if the property is made more appealing than its release version), and even if the altered material is distributed for free, its public consumption naturally cuts into artist royalties and producer revenue.
But what of the remixer/re-editor who distributes material for altruistic – e.g., artistic – reasons? The question of piracy becomes murky when education and aesthetics is brought into play, as a motivating cause and purpose of revised material; as seen, for example, in Mike J. Nichols's The Phantom Edit, and Christian Marclay's The Clock (neither of which have incurred legal penalties for their use of protected source material). If such celebrated works become more common – as seems possible, if not likely – how might they affect concepts of authorship, ownership, criticism, and industry power? Though copyrighted material tends to be remixed or re-edited for individual rather than public use, is it possible to develop a new regard for the moving image, a regard both critical and creative, that favors social and communal reception of cultural products? Might visual culture benefit from a more considered film consumption, by viewers who not only possess the tools to produce and alter content, but who can also employ a relevant, relatable aesthetic – an aesthetic born of their capacity for fragmenting, replaying, and manipulating commercial material?
When people have asked me who this book is written for, I describe a digitally-fluent consumer of popular culture, preferably with a basic knowledge of film terms (e.g., ""dissolve,"" ""fade-out,"" ""close-up""), who also moonlights – at least occasionally – as a cultural producer. Few young readers would escape this description, yet when I consider the cultural and technological fluency of my students (most of whom are in their twenties), I'm surprised by how rare the critical eye is. Preferences and aversions are readily expressed, but most are at a loss to explain the mechanics of their visual pleasure, distaste, and so forth. For so many fellow consumers I speak to, in and beyond the classroom, it's as if a dividing blade has been dropped, by the binary ""rotten""/""fresh,"" ""like""/""dislike"" structuring of digital life. If the ease of image-making, access, and manipulation has produced too many options relative to one's capacity to discern, decipher, or communicate through moving images, then a pause for reflection seems in order. We might then reconsider some of cinema's most effective and problematic output, not through an endlessly discursive analysis of possible significations and personal tastes, but through a more neutral  examination of the basic elements of form and style. At this stage in the evolution of motion picture narrative, a formalist lens may be the most useful to consumers, for their creative as well as critical capacities. My hope for Brass Ring is that it offers not only theoretical grist for students of film, or mere critique of a handful of influential blockbusters, but a practical guide for moviegoers generally – a path forward for feature film making and appreciation in the Digital Age. 
 
Five Excerpts from Brass Ring
Chapter excerpt: The Latest Marvel (on the superhero film)
... ""The trend in taste and product ramps ever upward in visuality, aurality, and often tone (e.g., from whimsical to peremptory). At least stylistically, the unfortunate formal consequences of this shift can be seen in Frank Miller’s monstrous noir-fantasy The Spirit (2008), an abysmally dark, perversely over-produced translation of more playful, colorful source material (Will Eisner’s titular newspaper strip [1940-1952]). To be clear, the failing of Miller’s film is not in its pictorial or thematic “darkness” so much as its desperately playful accenting,  when the ludic nature of the original strip – a combination of fluid artwork, pulp surrealism, and parodic undercurrent – could scarcely translate to big budget, live-action form; the cost of such grandly-scaled artifice is simply too great for so light a spirit, and the guiltless delight its expression elicits. Though more palatable, Luc Besson’s equally “playful” live-action fantasy The Adventures of Adèle Blanc-Sec (2010) reflects the same delusion of contemporary digital cinema, spending an estimated twenty-five million euros to reify – without improving on or capturing the sprightly intrigue of – its comic book source. (Note that Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s cartoonish action comedy Micmacs a tire-larigot, released six months earlier and produced for about the same amount, suffers no such withering comparison. The soufflé holds. Despite its obvious nostalgia and epic, action-fantasy form, it appears freshly conceived and executed, in part because its digital identity is restricted to color grading and background work, but also because its somewhat anachronistic, slapstick action is leveraged with immediate, real-world concerns; in particular arms manufacturers and the consequences of their products’ global distribution.) This doesn’t mean form can’t overcome material strictures, but the shadow of economics can lie heavily on the act and object of art. The litheness of a bird in flight may be captured in stone, as Brancusi demonstrated with L’Oiseau dans l’espace, but append a $27 million purchase price and the work is made to bear an almost supernatural weight. The blockbuster production that “puts its money on the screen,” as Miller’s The Spirit does to such clear and distasteful effect, bears an even greater burden in its effort to take flight and justify its evident expense."" ...
 
Chapter excerpt: Dreaming of a Creative Spectatorship (on Méliès and Scorsese's Hugo)
... ""From the earliest projections of the Lumières and the Lathams, to the most advanced practical effects work of Industrial Light and Magic, cinema has demonstrated a profound and spectacular connection with the world outside that of cinematic illusion, as it appears on screen in purely visual form. In her formal analysis of Hugo’s use of stereoscopic space, Purse reveals the nuanced visual sensibility Scorsese brings to the production, distinguishing it from so many major releases conceived and shot in digital 3D. What this thoughtful reading seems to avoid is the film’s overwhelmingly visual character and excessively tight choreography, suggesting an overwound watch; every element of the narrative is graphically represented, unambiguously, and these elements – including the illusion of spatial depth (an “articulation of cinematic space” only in the crudest sense) – are very often computer-generated. The precisely controlled, virtualized figure and/or setting may function as a neutral tool of art, but where the virtual mise en scène prevails in the live-action context, the non-virtual is slighted. To claim that the city or open ocean as reflected in the eye of the camera is no more valuable to cinema than its digital substitute – and perhaps less so for its restive nature – is another form of slight. The same applies to film fantasy when grounded in the live. Seeing Jean Marais’s beast, cocooned in make-up with only his eyes exposed,  one might argue that the weight of the character/creature’s gaze, playing between the who and the what, is simply an artful trick of the medium; a surreal effect of masking, amplified and forced to evolve by the close-up. But there can be no question a living actor moved beneath each strand of fur and thread of costuming – that their eyes once shone before the lens (and no less the eyes of Marais, who suffered the elaborate prosthetics, embodied beauty and beast, and initially suggested the adaptation to Cocteau). Even in the busier, more extreme féerieabstractions of Méliès, the same grounding is evident, and it wasn’t placed there out of fealty to classical theater or the veristic. Though the popular image of Méliès has gained a certain luster and originary status by his place in film history, his goals were chiefly amusement and fantasy spectacle. Whatever realism exists in Méliès’s work exists as a characteristic of live-action production – of practical and quite mundane means – but also because his scenarios were recorded on 
photochemical emulsion, with occasional in-camera effects – effects that relied on the profilmic. As an illusionist of the stage and screen he had no obligation to or particular interest in film’s full mimetic capacities, outside its improvement of the live magic act and suggestion of fantastic persons, creatures, and locales (e.g., the Sun, Moon, hell, the North Pole) – again, primarily as astonishing sights, not as autonomous subjects that existed outside the picture plane, or grew past this visual stricture through artistic maturation (as in the work of contemporary Louis Feuillade)."" ...
 
Chapter excerpt: Bigness as Disaster (on filmic excess and amendment)
...""Critically viewing a disaster-romance on the order of Titanic – in which excess defines the picture – or Michael Cimino’s infamously outsized Heaven’s Gate (1980), or the sometimes meandering Nashville (d. Robert Altman, 1972) – in which the drawling pace is largely the point – there may in certain passages be a desire for trimming, but no clear sense of how much. Taking a hand in a feature by attempting to amend it, by digital means, the critical enterprise can assume a finer, more formal dimension, allowing one to better understand what material disserves the film, and how much of it to excise. One may also find that no cutting, however deep or fine, will improve Cameron’s Titanic or Cimino’s Heaven’s Gate. In other titles considered for revision, technical and/or aesthetic problems encountered in certain key shots, lines of dialogue, effects work and so on must be allowed their unfortunate influence, for removing such blemishes would in some cases seriously injure or kill the organism of the film, calling to mind the figure of Georgiana (in Hawthorne’s “The Birth-Mark”), whose husband chemically dissolves a hand-shaped birthmark on her cheek, only to watch her die as the mark fades. Complicating matters, the aesthetic dilemmas and obstacles that face the consumer-revised film are often exterior to the works themselves (apart from the perennial problem of tunnel vision in revisions conducted by a single 
editor).Thinning a largely unnecessary forty-minute lead-up to Skull Island in Peter Jackson’s King Kong (2005) seems a sensible choice, and would resolve at least some of the project’s indulgent character – assuming this is desirable, and the film’s role as document of mounting hubris is set aside – but the victory of improvement by streamlining would still be diminished by the presence of a more economical, agile treatment of the same material in the 1933 version. The original, potentially originary nature of other, less celebrated titles suggests a stronger cause for reform. For example, elimination of the monster visuals in Night of the Demon (d. Jacques Tourneur, 1957) not only produces a deeper, more disturbing impression of the supernatural, the absence of the controversial shots – which are fairly easily excised without affect to flow – brings the viewer closer to the cast and crew’s best artistic intentions."" ... 
 
Chapter excerpt: The Source's Apprentice (on Marclay's The Clock)
... ""The Clock’s often marvelous, unexpected flow is due to careful use of split edits at almost every turn, while visual and conceptual motifs also serve to unify the disparate source material. Clip length varies greatly, but tends toward staccato cutting at the top of each hour – noon and midnight being among the most spectacular (and best attended). I expected the piece to require an elaborate playback system with multiple synched hard drives, but as Marclay explained to me on the closing night of one museum engagement, “I actually managed to fit the whole thing on a Mac mini, but the new one, the one without any moving parts.”  The solid state drive and player suggests one of The Clock’s most alluring aspects: the miraculous capacity to contain what appears to be – at least at first glance – a clock-themed survey of the whole of cinema, using current PC technology and an elegantly simple, exacting, yet profoundly inclusive editing formula. It should be noted, however, that few museum-goers are likely to devote more than a few hours to the piece; fewer still its full cycle. The impression of a “profoundly inclusive,” 
distilling view of film history’s most literal treatments of time seems inevitable, but the less time one actually spends with The Clock, the better one’s chances of maintaining this impression; there’s always room for the missing element when only a portion of an artwork is seen."" ... 
 
Chapter excerpt: The Crowded Exit (on the conclusion of Jackson's 'Rings trilogy)
... ""The concluding scenes of The Return of the King are the most crucial in the saga, as they bear the greatest burden of justification for the viewer devoting over seven hours to it. Minutes have been spent well and frivolously until now, with less successful material passing largely without penalty – in the form of impatience – due to the overall quality of the production. This stage of the film is different. Its various settings and exchanges signify not only completion but summation, so anymisstep falls with greater weight, leaving a deeper, fresher imprint before the threshold of memory, the principal residence of every adult viewer. The error of ending at Sam’s home, with its presumptive curtain call and homiletic postlude, is that it is treated merely as a colorful, true-to-Tolkien exit, sealed with an antique end title, when it is in truth an entrance and lens through which we access the preceding film. A sense of obligation to the letter of the source should not now – if ever – force the hand of the filmmaker. Yet this is precisely what has happened, and unless its view is likewise obscured by a dominating image of the text, the general audience must pay the price for the adherent’s pleasure of recognition. "" ...",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Uses of the Mobile Art Gallery</h3>
<div></div>Architect
Anna Koosmann of Afton is contributing her expertise to design a Mobile Art Gallery that will fit three uses. We imagine a pull-behind trailer that will:</div><div>
1) be a <b>roaming art gallery</b>,<br/>
2) host a <b>""Fresh Art"" roadside stand</b> (not unlike a produce
stand), and<br/>
3) provide a <b>venue for pop-up performances</b>.<div></div>
<div>This transformational space makes it possible for ArtReach to serve multiple disciplines and many audiences.<br/><br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>Our goal is to raise $5,000 to match the amount we have already secured in grants from <span style=""background-color: initial;"">the St. Croix Valley Foundation and MidWest<i>One</i> Bank. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Additionally, a grant from the Metropolitan Regional Arts Council will be used for first pop-up performances in September 2016.</span></li> <li>ArtReach will be sure to give all donors updates on the progress and plans for the Mobile Art Gallery.</li>
<li>The funds that we raise for this project will be used to pay for the materials and building of the Mobile Art Gallery.</li>
<li>Supporters of our crowd fundraising will be invited to a special champagne toast to launch the Mobile Art Gallery - we may even sacrifice a bottle of champagne in celebration.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>ArtReach St. Croix strives for surprise and originality in all facets of our work. The Mobile Art Gallery lines up with ArtReach's values and goals by:</div> <ul> <li>providing a fun and unique way to increase the number of people who will be directly served by ArtReach,</li> <li>expanding the awareness of other art resources, events and venues all over the Valley, and</li> <li>sharing our enthusiasm for the visual, performing and literary arts that happen in this special place.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> The Mobile Art Gallery does not come without challenges. Because it is a new project, there are obstacles that ArtReach must prepare for and overcome with everyone's help. The Mobile Art Gallery has:</p> <ul> <li>an aggressive timeline,</li>

 The Mobile Art Gallery is a surprising and delightful way to experience art of all kinds in the St. Croix Valley.

Connecting art with nature is another focus for ArtReach. We love to create artful ways to interact with the landscapes and waterways of the St. Croix Valley.
The Mobile Art Gallery will bring art to state parks, nature areas, rivertowns, community events and other places around Valley.  With your help, we will build the most efficient and effective structure for our exhibiting artists, performers, and volunteers.

Uses of the Mobile Art Gallery
Architect
Anna Koosmann of Afton is contributing her expertise to design a Mobile Art Gallery that will fit three uses. We imagine a pull-behind trailer that will:
1) be a roaming art gallery,
2) host a ""Fresh Art"" roadside stand (not unlike a produce
stand), and
3) provide a venue for pop-up performances.
This transformational space makes it possible for ArtReach to serve multiple disciplines and many audiences.
   What We Need & What You Get  Our goal is to raise $5,000 to match the amount we have already secured in grants from the St. Croix Valley Foundation and MidWestOne Bank. 

Additionally, a grant from the Metropolitan Regional Arts Council will be used for first pop-up performances in September 2016. ArtReach will be sure to give all donors updates on the progress and plans for the Mobile Art Gallery.
The funds that we raise for this project will be used to pay for the materials and building of the Mobile Art Gallery.
Supporters of our crowd fundraising will be invited to a special champagne toast to launch the Mobile Art Gallery - we may even sacrifice a bottle of champagne in celebration.    The Impact
ArtReach St. Croix strives for surprise and originality in all facets of our work. The Mobile Art Gallery lines up with ArtReach's values and goals by:  providing a fun and unique way to increase the number of people who will be directly served by ArtReach, expanding the awareness of other art resources, events and venues all over the Valley, and sharing our enthusiasm for the visual, performing and literary arts that happen in this special place.    Risks & Challenges  The Mobile Art Gallery does not come without challenges. Because it is a new project, there are obstacles that ArtReach must prepare for and overcome with everyone's help. The Mobile Art Gallery has:  an aggressive timeline,
a big vision,
the need for a project manager and dedicated volunteer builders, and
the backing of creative people who can help us overcome these challenges.    Other Ways You Can Help If you are unable to contribute but would still like to help, you can:  volunteer your time and skills to help us with the construction process,

allow us to continue building large
installations and using non-conventional disciplines, as a way to
create art.  The deer/stag is an animal that we resonate with and we were 
inspired to capture the beauty of nature's architecture in a sculpture 
of a stag's skull.  In Beatrix the White's vision, the stag is a symbol of silent 
strength and the skull is a reminder of <span>the </span><span>graceful  balance between life and death.  </span>When exploring the design, Ms. Oh came across the story of Actaeon and was inspired to incorporate it into the name of our sculpture.<br/><br/><b>The Story of Actaeon:</b><br/>The legendary huntsman of Greek myth, a grandson of Cadmus.
 During a hunt, he left the party and wandered alone through the forest 
when he suddenly came upon a clearing. There he saw the goddess Artemis
 bathing in a large pool, surrounded by her nymphs. When they noticed 
the hunter they flew themselves before the goddess, but he had already 
seen her splendid nakedness. Angered, she turned him into a stag for she
 refused to let any mortal say that he had seen Artemis naked. 
Actaeon moved away from the clearing feeling different and confused, not
 yet realizing what had happened to him. The truth hit him when he saw 
his own reflection in a river and he knew he was no longer human. In the
 distance he heard the sound of his own hounds. A brief moment of joy 
quickly turned into fear when he realized they were hunting him now, not
 recognizing their former master. He fled but was eventually overrun and
 torn to pieces by them. <br/><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330912/files/20140126133204-ActaeonCaserta2.jpg?1390771924"" src="""" style=""width: 330.248px; height: 507px;""/></p><br/><p><b>Physical Description:</b><br/></p><p>The
 Skull of Actaeon is
shaped like a stag's skull, as you would find it while wandering in the 
woods. This sculpture will be constructed from plywood and 2 x 4's to 
create the skull base.  The antlers will be constructed from pvc pipes, and
recycled rebar, anchored into the ground by steel 
wire.  The skull base will stand approx. 4 feet tall, with antlers 
extending to
 approx. 13 ft. In each of the eye sockets, an altar space will be 
created. The outside of the sculpture will be skinned in thin strips of 
wood, resourced from pallets.  The antlers will be skinned in fabric and
 internally lit via a programmed LED grid, which is remote
controlled, and capable of syncing with audio.  We also hope to create an interactive light experience using an arduino controller, allowing the participant to change and control the lights.  Additionally, the skull 
will be internally lit, filtering soft light through the slits between 
the strips of pallet.  The altars will create a shared experience with 
our
community, intended to address a need for a sacred space.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330921/files/20140126133504-Deer_Skull_Still_4.jpg?1390772104"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>But where is the money going?<br/>

allow us to continue building large
installations and using non-conventional disciplines, as a way to
create art.  The deer/stag is an animal that we resonate with and we were 
inspired to capture the beauty of nature's architecture in a sculpture 
of a stag's skull.  In Beatrix the White's vision, the stag is a symbol of silent 
strength and the skull is a reminder of the graceful  balance between life and death.  When exploring the design, Ms. Oh came across the story of Actaeon and was inspired to incorporate it into the name of our sculpture.The Story of Actaeon:The legendary huntsman of Greek myth, a grandson of Cadmus.
 During a hunt, he left the party and wandered alone through the forest 
when he suddenly came upon a clearing. There he saw the goddess Artemis
 bathing in a large pool, surrounded by her nymphs. When they noticed 
the hunter they flew themselves before the goddess, but he had already 
seen her splendid nakedness. Angered, she turned him into a stag for she
 refused to let any mortal say that he had seen Artemis naked. 
Actaeon moved away from the clearing feeling different and confused, not
 yet realizing what had happened to him. The truth hit him when he saw 
his own reflection in a river and he knew he was no longer human. In the
 distance he heard the sound of his own hounds. A brief moment of joy 
quickly turned into fear when he realized they were hunting him now, not
 recognizing their former master. He fled but was eventually overrun and
 torn to pieces by them. Physical Description:The
 Skull of Actaeon is
shaped like a stag's skull, as you would find it while wandering in the 
woods. This sculpture will be constructed from plywood and 2 x 4's to 
create the skull base.  The antlers will be constructed from pvc pipes, and
recycled rebar, anchored into the ground by steel 
wire.  The skull base will stand approx. 4 feet tall, with antlers 
extending to
 approx. 13 ft. In each of the eye sockets, an altar space will be 
created. The outside of the sculpture will be skinned in thin strips of 
wood, resourced from pallets.  The antlers will be skinned in fabric and
 internally lit via a programmed LED grid, which is remote
controlled, and capable of syncing with audio.  We also hope to create an interactive light experience using an arduino controller, allowing the participant to change and control the lights.  Additionally, the skull 
will be internally lit, filtering soft light through the slits between 
the strips of pallet.  The altars will create a shared experience with 
our
community, intended to address a need for a sacred space.But where is the money going?
We need money...approximately $4500.
This budget is for new materials, but that is really the minimal costs of our budget. 
Our plan is to locate and source re-used or recycled materials, to save money. 
However, recycled materials are no guaranteed, so we have planned for
all expenses. On top of that gas is really expensive.  We really want to take it places this summer- ESPECIALLY BURNING MAN!  So if you want to see this project there then please donate.  The more money we get the better we can make this project (including possible interactive visuals)!!!

The Skull of Actaeon is interactive in that it is physically there for people
 to touch and see, with altars to contribute to. As well, the lighting component is capable of 
syncing up with the music of the event and can also be controlled by the participants. We are hoping to develop interactive visuals, that the participant can control with their hand movements. Come play with it at one of the many festivals we hope to bring it to.Your Support Means a Lot!!!!
Your support means a lot to us, so we'd like to show 
our gratitude for that support  with some amazing rewards (which you can
 see over to the right side of the page.) Every single penny we raise 
goes right into The Skull of Actaeon.  Like all of our art projects, this is a 
labor of love for us.  Not only are we donating our own time and money 
to this project, but we are donating from our business to help make this
 project come alive.
At the end of the day though, the reward that WE, the
 build team, and YOU, our supporter will share in is the amazing sense 
of community that you are helping to create. Here are examples of some of the great swag you will get:NOTE: These are mock-ups only.  We will post new photos when we have received the real product.  Thanks for your patience!Can't contribute, but still want to help???

This is my first time in the Cali area, and for that purpose, I knew the first place that I would have to stop into was High Voltage Tattoo! This shop is home to some of the worlds best artists and most acclaimed names! Why is any of this information important to you? Well.... you're about to come into my story!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Broke College Graduate...</h3> <p>I submitted an appointment form via the website on their page, and surprisingly received interest from two different tattoo artists in a short amount of time! While this is amazing news for someone who wasn't expecting much more than a hopeful walk in appointment, the estimated price on this piece was a bit out of my price range for the entirety of my trip! That's why I've turned to you, my wonderful readers, in hopes that you can find it in your heart of hearts to donate whatever you can for some permanent ink on my skin!</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Ink</h3>
<div>In a mixture combination of the things that I love, my desire for the need of self fulfillment is established between my astrological sign and that of theatrical implementation. In this sketch by 17th century artist Johannis Hevelius, the two worlds intertwine to tell the tale of the Sagittarius. Located on my right forearm, this tattoo will forever fly through my life with me; and receiving it at such a high end shop after a big event in my life that I am more than proud of is just the icing on the cake!  </div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This trip for my family and I is one that we'll forever remember. Not only is a vacation fulfilling, but this is the last one we will have as a group for quite some time. My younger brother is in the NAVY and has been stationed across the sea and a whole lot of miles away for a few years as of this July. Everyday will be spent in the present, and though it will be hard at the end, having something that is permanently there to remind me of the different roads we lead in life will be a great addition to the word I currently have tattooed on my wrist; ""Breathe.""  </p>

The John Biggers Art Bridge and Seed Project (Seed) is a
public art and collaborative design effort 
engaging renowned African  American artists, local lead artsts Tacoumba Aiken and Seitu Jones in mentoring of 13 emerging artists in placemaking and
career development. Seed is inspired by the Celebration of Life Mural project,
an acclaimed public artwork led by Dr. John Biggers, a major African American
artist of the twentieth century, which began the careers of young artists and
organizations (including Obsidian Arts and Juxtaposition Arts), planting
artistic “seeds” and reflecting the legacies of north Minneapolis neighborhoods - Harrison, Heritage Park, Near North, and North Loop.Seed has four goals:

Engage artists across generations in a
collaborative effort to create a vibrant place that speaks to the culture and
legacies of the north Minneapolis areas;
Grow, launch and nurture the public art careers
of emerging artists;
Build an attractive connection between these
North neighborhoods (Harrison, Heritage Park, North Loop and Near North) and downtown
that improves walk-ability and make the area more attractive to residents and
visitors;

To create a process that is replicable so that
we can continue to increase the diversity and competitiveness of the state’s
public artists.


Seed is funded by the City of Minneapolis Art in
Public Places Program, the National Endowment for the Arts Our Town Program,
the McKnight Foundation Regions and Communities Program, the Pohlad Family
Foundation and the North Loop Association.Meet the artistsMeet Artists VideoImpactSeed aims to impact the north Minneapolis area in three

<p><strong>Telling stories in a forgotten way</strong></p>
<p>Anamnesis is a collaboration with five Iranian tribal women, in a show of rugs, using the power of recollection and the art of weaving to tell their personal stories. It explores how the tradition of rug weaving is slowly vanishing in Iran. It aims to restore the weavers as creators as opposed to manual laborers by reinstating the power of symbols and heritage of storytelling, in a practice, that’s an important part of nomadic and tribal culture in Iran.</p>
<p>The show in New York will be accompanied by a short film chronicling the journey of the project and a limited edition book showcasing each weaver, their final piece and the memory that inspired it.</p>
<p>The project will culminate with an exhibition in late fall of 2019 in Tehran, Iran and will travel to New York in the winter of the same year with the possibility of traveling to other cities across the United States in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Mythology &amp; lore of creation</strong></p>
<p>Rug weaving is deeply tied to Iranian culture, history and art. Nomadic and tribal weavings have their own unique history and traditions and carry significant information and stories about their makers. They contain meaningful symbols, beliefs taken from myths and folklore that were handed down from one generation to the next. Not only were the motifs regarded as powerful but also the belief in the act of tying knots to manifest desires made hand knotted weavings incredibly strong talismans that served an important purpose in the lives of the nomadic tribes.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1 : Already completed!!</strong></p>
<p>Over the course of several magical months in 2018, I traveled and researched in major cities throughout Iran where rug production has been a main source of income for majority of nomadic tribes and tribal villagers. I spent time with 18 weavers, women from very humble backgrounds, discussing how and when they began weaving, what impact weaving has had on their lives and how they regard it as artisans. They shared their memories from childhood, as young women and later as wives who would use this craft to support families of rather large sizes. Simultaneously, I would share memories from my own life as an artist, an ex-pat, and what weaving means to me.</p>
<p>To gain deeper knowledge about the history of weaving in Iran, I interviewed professors, young artists and foundations whose sole purpose is to preserve and work in traditional Iranian crafts, most importantly, rug weaving. To my unfortunate surprise, it seemed that due to severe competition on the world stage, the worsening economy and political reasons the art of rug weaving is slowly dying out of newer generations and that as the New York Times stated in 2016, “the Persian rug may not be long for this world” <a href=""https://nyti.ms/1Wm9MLM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://nyti.ms/1Wm9MLM</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 2 : Summer 2019, right around the corner!</strong></p>
<p>These talented women will be choosing and weaving a memory or a story that they’ve already shared with me and deem personally significant. An important outcome of this stage is to give them support to work on a personal project that has meaning for them and reinstate them as creators. Currently, they are only recognized as hands producing a product and all are severely underpaid for their time and expertise. Their generational knowledge is regarded as disposable and the importance of giving them agency is not a factor in their treatment.</p>
<p>I will be working with five weavers after discussing the premise of the project with each. We will be drafting a letter of agreement to be signed by each woman. We’ll be calculating their wages by the World Fair Trade Organization standard which states :</p>
<p><i>“A Local Living Wage is remuneration received for a standard working week (no more than 48 hours) by a Worker in a particular place, sufficient to afford a decent standard of living for the Worker and her or his family.”</i></p>
<p>This is not a NPO (non-profit organization) endeavor and I am not a member of the WFTO but I am using their guidelines as a global model to pay fair wages and make sure working conditions meet the WFTO standards. Most weavers, if not all, work out of their homes as it allows them to take care of their families and homes.</p>
<p>All materials and custom made looms will be provided by myself and donated to the women. I will be conducting a 2-3 week design workshop where we’ll be helping the weavers refine their ideas and mainly give them support and self confidence to work on a personal project that has meaning for them.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 3 : Winter of 2020 : Funded by your generous DONATIONS!</strong></p>
<p>Your donations will be used to bring the project to its final stages and our show in New York in the winter of 2020. Any funds raised above our goal will be put towards shows in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles with hopes to make it a traveling exhibit across the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Short Film :</strong> Our fifteen minute short film will be a visual diary of this project. The film will be in post-production in New York City. A post-production team will be commissioned for the video and sound editing, translations, voice-overs, subtitles, graphics, color correction, music, raw footage archiving as well as other technical needs for the final completion of this short film.  </p>
<p><strong>Limited Edition Book : </strong>A 30 page book will be designed and published in New York City in two languages: Persian and English. This collectors item will show the journey and roots of this project not only with visuals but also with profiles of each weaver and their unique stories. Each weaver’s personal anecdote of the significance of the particular memory they decide to manifest on the loom will be chronicled in this special limited edition book. Along with a seasoned graphic designer, we’re hiring a translator, editor and we’ll be printing with an independent publishing house.</p>
<p><strong>Pop-Up Gallery Exhibit New York : </strong>The purpose of this project is to share the rarely told stories, incredible talent and unique history of these women with an audience that would otherwise never have access to them. With an exhibit that showcases their pieces, our limited edition book and viewings of our short film, we want to share this special journey with others. With your donations, we’ll be able to host a pop-up gallery for a minimum run of two weeks. This includes space rental and exhibit preparation, installation of pieces, special lighting, labeling, video projection, audio production, and an opening reception.</p>

<p><strong>Post-Anamnesis and why this project is important</strong></p>
<p>Beyond this project and the multiple shows, we aim to preserve and rekindle the long tradition of ""zehni-bafi"" - weaving from memory - not only to inspire but to teach these women to tell stories the ancient way by use of motifs and emblems. It is our desire to once again give deeper meaning to what these women create and provide a platform where they have a role in the outcome and significance of the product that they painstakingly work on. These traditions are rapidly fading, it is the hope that this endeavor will reignite the artisanal passion for newer generations and continue to preserve this beautiful artistic craft.  </p>

<p><strong>Project Creator</strong></p>
<p>I am Nazanin Sadr Azodi, an Iranian-American textile designer.             </p>
<p>My 15 year career in the design industry has afforded me an in depth view of mass market and the damaging effects it can have on local crafts. As a designer as well as a director, my push for high level design, no matter the tier of market, and the demand for better quality was always met with bottom line thinking. The stripping of quality, which inevitably would lead to the dumbing down of the design aesthetic, and disregard for craftspeople and consumers left me disillusioned with the world of design. I, not only as a maker, but also as a consumer, wanted to support products that had soul and a story to tell. Ultimately my distaste for fast design and cheap products along with a need to better align my daily practice as a designer with my ethics led me back to my home country of Iran where I rediscovered my love of textiles and the women who make them. This time of reflecting and connecting with these women through a shared narrative experience and our love of weaving was humbling and beautiful. To learn about the history and mythology of rug weaving in Iran, where its roots lie, was a haunting and an unforgettable experience that I want to share with others.</p>

<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>While I am optimistic and hopeful that we will reach our funding goals to bring this project onto the global stage, I am 100% dedicated to bringing Anamnesis to fruition whether or not we reach it. This project is a manifestation of the last ten months working relentlessly non-stop. As a result of following my intuition to bring a vision and a voice to these rarely known artisans, I quit my job and used my life savings to research and travel solo across Iran in search of these gifted weavers. Due diligence was taken at every juncture to ensure that we do not hit any roadblocks or obstacles. I've consulted lawyers, accountants, and have interviewed countless collaborators to make this an outstanding endeavor.</p>
<p>This is an ambitious project and it involves many moving parts. The risks and challenges involved are all in the arena of time. I've accounted for unforeseen delays in our timeline but there can always be more surprises no matter the extent of planning and delicate logistics. Rest assured, I am a 15 year veteran of an industry that operates on very tight deadlines, demands you to work on an array of projects simultaneously and manage internal and external teams. Hence, I'm well equipped to handle large projects whether here in the United States or internationally while meeting deadlines and delivering results.</p>
<p>So stay tuned to our updates on Indiegogo and follow us on our Instagram. I will be documenting every step of the way and updating constantly. Not only do I want to be completely transparent with the process, I want all of you to enjoy and witness this special journey with us!  </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you can't donate at this moment (but maybe a lil later! Think of it as getting me an Indiegogo drink! ;)) I ask that you kindly share our Indiegogo funding page on your social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) - put us out there! Indiegogo has really easy-to-use buttons on the top right corner of our page.</p>
<p>We're truly *grateful* for you believing in us, valuing this ancient craft, respecting these women as precious and rare artisans they are and enabling us to make this project an incredible success!</p>

This is not a NPO (non-profit organization) endeavor and I am not a member of the WFTO but I am using their guidelines as a global model to pay fair wages and make sure working conditions meet the WFTO standards. Most weavers, if not all, work out of their homes as it allows them to take care of their families and homes.
All materials and custom made looms will be provided by myself and donated to the women. I will be conducting a 2-3 week design workshop where we’ll be helping the weavers refine their ideas and mainly give them support and self confidence to work on a personal project that has meaning for them.

Phase 3 : Winter of 2020 : Funded by your generous DONATIONS!
Your donations will be used to bring the project to its final stages and our show in New York in the winter of 2020. Any funds raised above our goal will be put towards shows in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles with hopes to make it a traveling exhibit across the United States.
Short Film : Our fifteen minute short film will be a visual diary of this project. The film will be in post-production in New York City. A post-production team will be commissioned for the video and sound editing, translations, voice-overs, subtitles, graphics, color correction, music, raw footage archiving as well as other technical needs for the final completion of this short film.  
Limited Edition Book : A 30 page book will be designed and published in New York City in two languages: Persian and English. This collectors item will show the journey and roots of this project not only with visuals but also with profiles of each weaver and their unique stories. Each weaver’s personal anecdote of the significance of the particular memory they decide to manifest on the loom will be chronicled in this special limited edition book. Along with a seasoned graphic designer, we’re hiring a translator, editor and we’ll be printing with an independent publishing house.
Pop-Up Gallery Exhibit New York : The purpose of this project is to share the rarely told stories, incredible talent and unique history of these women with an audience that would otherwise never have access to them. With an exhibit that showcases their pieces, our limited edition book and viewings of our short film, we want to share this special journey with others. With your donations, we’ll be able to host a pop-up gallery for a minimum run of two weeks. This includes space rental and exhibit preparation, installation of pieces, special lighting, labeling, video projection, audio production, and an opening reception.

Post-Anamnesis and why this project is important
Beyond this project and the multiple shows, we aim to preserve and rekindle the long tradition of ""zehni-bafi"" - weaving from memory - not only to inspire but to teach these women to tell stories the ancient way by use of motifs and emblems. It is our desire to once again give deeper meaning to what these women create and provide a platform where they have a role in the outcome and significance of the product that they painstakingly work on. These traditions are rapidly fading, it is the hope that this endeavor will reignite the artisanal passion for newer generations and continue to preserve this beautiful artistic craft.

Project Creator
I am Nazanin Sadr Azodi, an Iranian-American textile designer.             
My 15 year career in the design industry has afforded me an in depth view of mass market and the damaging effects it can have on local crafts. As a designer as well as a director, my push for high level design, no matter the tier of market, and the demand for better quality was always met with bottom line thinking. The stripping of quality, which inevitably would lead to the dumbing down of the design aesthetic, and disregard for craftspeople and consumers left me disillusioned with the world of design. I, not only as a maker, but also as a consumer, wanted to support products that had soul and a story to tell. Ultimately my distaste for fast design and cheap products along with a need to better align my daily practice as a designer with my ethics led me back to my home country of Iran where I rediscovered my love of textiles and the women who make them. This time of reflecting and connecting with these women through a shared narrative experience and our love of weaving was humbling and beautiful. To learn about the history and mythology of rug weaving in Iran, where its roots lie, was a haunting and an unforgettable experience that I want to share with others.

Risks & Challenges
While I am optimistic and hopeful that we will reach our funding goals to bring this project onto the global stage, I am 100% dedicated to bringing Anamnesis to fruition whether or not we reach it. This project is a manifestation of the last ten months working relentlessly non-stop. As a result of following my intuition to bring a vision and a voice to these rarely known artisans, I quit my job and used my life savings to research and travel solo across Iran in search of these gifted weavers. Due diligence was taken at every juncture to ensure that we do not hit any roadblocks or obstacles. I've consulted lawyers, accountants, and have interviewed countless collaborators to make this an outstanding endeavor.
This is an ambitious project and it involves many moving parts. The risks and challenges involved are all in the arena of time. I've accounted for unforeseen delays in our timeline but there can always be more surprises no matter the extent of planning and delicate logistics. Rest assured, I am a 15 year veteran of an industry that operates on very tight deadlines, demands you to work on an array of projects simultaneously and manage internal and external teams. Hence, I'm well equipped to handle large projects whether here in the United States or internationally while meeting deadlines and delivering results.
So stay tuned to our updates on Indiegogo and follow us on our Instagram. I will be documenting every step of the way and updating constantly. Not only do I want to be completely transparent with the process, I want all of you to enjoy and witness this special journey with us!  
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate at this moment (but maybe a lil later! Think of it as getting me an Indiegogo drink! ;)) I ask that you kindly share our Indiegogo funding page on your social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) - put us out there! Indiegogo has really easy-to-use buttons on the top right corner of our page.
We're truly *grateful* for you believing in us, valuing this ancient craft, respecting these women as precious and rare artisans they are and enabling us to make this project an incredible success!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>VideoSynth is an interactive audio/video installation that uses you as the instrument of live art. At one end of the installation is an automated touch screen video booth that elicits a series of responses from participants. The video recording appears at the mixing station console where participants can select their videos and play them back on a large screen while manipulating and synthesizing the sound, video, and background art in real time. The dynamic video portrait can be saved and emailed to users. Participants can also generate 4""x6"" still photographic prints on the fly by pressing a print button on the controller. The project is part video booth, part photo booth, part dynamic portrait machine, and part musical instrument. Please got to <a href=""http://videosynth.me"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://videosynth.me</a> to see photos of the installation.</p>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise at least $5000 in the immediate future to help defray some of the costs of gear and transportation to upcoming events and festivals. Our next event is BurningMan and we would like to do live printing there. It will cost about $1500 to do this at BurningMan. The printer will be ruined from the dust at this event. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We are also trying to create a new video booth with an embedded camera system. The current video kiosk does not have an embedded camera so we may run into dust issues with that as well. </p>
<p>We are really interested in the concept of playing yourself like a live instrument. We created this system for you to dynamically create a live video and play it back with audio like a live moving portrait on a massive screen. You can save the video portrait and also make printed still portraits in the process. We think it's a lot of fun!</p>
<p>We are doing 2 private gallery showings of the project for donors in a gallery setting, one on August 17, and one in October 2013. All donors will be emailed invitations and details to these events.</p>
<p>We've also designed some great personalized art pieces for you to preserve your video and still portraits with. Please check out the perks sections and go to <a href=""http://videosynth.me/gifts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://videosynth.me/gifts</a> for photos and details.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We think we have created a very unique project. Many of my friends and family have seen this project take shape over the last year. Your support for this project would mean the world to our team and help make this project the best that it can be.</p>

<p>Both as teenagers in the ’60’s and 60-year-­olds today, art has, and continues to be, the bridge that connects the gamut of racial, religious, and socioeconomic strata we comprise. In a time when diversity is constantly being challenged, we believe as a group we are bringing a breath of fresh air as well as important social commentary to the public viewer where the impact and influence is the greatest. </p>
<p>Monetary contributions will not only help to make this Group Exhibition a reality by allowing us to cover the costs of printed and promotional materials, hanging supplies, transporting of musical instruments, and domestic and international postage, but it will also offer the financial infusion needed to publicize this unprecedented event far and wide in our efforts to achieve the greatest public impact.</p>
<p>And we will be offering some incentives to contribute: for a <strong>$25 contribution</strong> you can receive a dvd of photos from the event and mention as a supporter in the program. For a <strong>$50 contribution</strong> we will be offering a dvd of photos as well as interviews with some of the artists, plus mention in the program. And for a <strong>$100 contribution</strong> we will offer all of the above and an autographed poster of the event.</p>
<p>For those of you who are viewers, creators, collectors, or otherwise appreciators of the arts, this conglomerate of media and styles by names you might recognize as well as those you will not, will certainly energize you. For those of you who simply seek out creative and robust causes worthy of your support, we believe this notable effort more than fits the bill.</p>
<p>Even if you can’t contribute money, your getting the word out is as good as gold. You can help us by using the Indiegogo share tools to let your friends, family and colleagues know what is about to take place.  You deserve to be part of this “Evolution!”</p>

Both as teenagers in the ’60’s and 60-year-­olds today, art has, and continues to be, the bridge that connects the gamut of racial, religious, and socioeconomic strata we comprise. In a time when diversity is constantly being challenged, we believe as a group we are bringing a breath of fresh air as well as important social commentary to the public viewer where the impact and influence is the greatest. 
Monetary contributions will not only help to make this Group Exhibition a reality by allowing us to cover the costs of printed and promotional materials, hanging supplies, transporting of musical instruments, and domestic and international postage, but it will also offer the financial infusion needed to publicize this unprecedented event far and wide in our efforts to achieve the greatest public impact.
And we will be offering some incentives to contribute: for a $25 contribution you can receive a dvd of photos from the event and mention as a supporter in the program. For a $50 contribution we will be offering a dvd of photos as well as interviews with some of the artists, plus mention in the program. And for a $100 contribution we will offer all of the above and an autographed poster of the event.
For those of you who are viewers, creators, collectors, or otherwise appreciators of the arts, this conglomerate of media and styles by names you might recognize as well as those you will not, will certainly energize you. For those of you who simply seek out creative and robust causes worthy of your support, we believe this notable effort more than fits the bill.
Even if you can’t contribute money, your getting the word out is as good as gold. You can help us by using the Indiegogo share tools to let your friends, family and colleagues know what is about to take place.  You deserve to be part of this “Evolution!”",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<strong>Elephant Room</strong> is a Chicago-based arts organization specializing in primarily local, under-represented artists and designers working across all types of media. We operate a retail art gallery in the South Loop neighborhood where we host art openings, creative events, talk and workshops on a regular basis. Our programs allow us to work beyond our storefront space and this campaign will further our reach out into the world!</div>
<div class=""section""><strong> </strong></div>
<div class=""section""><strong>Background</strong></div>
<div class=""section""><strong> </strong></div>
<div class=""section"">Elephant Room Gallery began in 2009 when the opportunity to partner with a local small business owner came along to transform a 320 square foot storefront into a gallery in the South Loop. I, Kimberly Leja-Atwood, attended the University of Illinois at Chicago and earned my BFA in photography. While there, I was a part of the New Works Group, composed of my fellow peers, where we frequently put together our own photography exhibitions. My interest in gallery work grew exponentially here as I enjoyed the collaborative nature of working with other artists and having a hand in curating exhibitions from start to finish. Elephant Room was a perfect fit for my interest and skill set. As Elephant Room took shape that first year, I continued to work full time as a commercial real estate photographer while holding art exhibitions every one to two months with limited viewing hours. The gallery was run entirely by myself and my husband, James, while we both worked full time at our day jobs.</div>
<div class=""layoutArea"">
<div class=""column"">
<p><span>In February of 2011, a couple of weeks after giving birth to my son, Austin, we re- opened Elephant Room as a retail art gallery where we exhibited a multitude of artists and designers, while still holding exhibitions every 1-2 months with a focus on under- represented artists. In addition, we started to branch out and hold many unique events including socials, open mics, live sketch events and launch parties. We also began to host exhibitions in other unique spaces in the city and became more involved with assisting artists in hosting their own open studio events. The Artist Assistance Program began to organically emerge as we hired on more of our own gallery interns and were able to commit to working with more established artists in their studios. </span></p>
<p><span>The most rewarding and unexpected element in all of this has been the strengthening of my own family unit as my husband James and I run the business together and our love for art continues to evolve. We both take our roles seriously and have learned to balance work and home life after a few years of trial and error. Our 19 month old, Austin, has been introduced to the art world from birth as he’s frequently with me at the gallery and enjoys his time there and has developed relationships with our artists just as we have. A great example of this is when James commissioned one of our long time artists, Jennifer Cronin, to paint a portrait of the three of us and our two dogs after our son Austin was born. The painting hangs in Austin’s bedroom as a constant reminder of why we’re doing this. </span></p>
<p><strong>The Campaign</strong></p>
<p>I started Elephant Room Gallery with the intention of providing a unique space that would be both an exhibition space and a resource for the Chicago art community. By working with under-represented artists Elephant Room provided a space for an up and coming artist the ability to build their resume, gain exposure, and make contacts.</p>
<p><span>Today, Elephant Room Gallery is much more than a retail outlet and gallery space. This transition is very intentional. After a year of exhibiting emerging artists and holding openings, artist talks and workshops, we decided that we needed to do more with the </span>community and involve even more artists and interested community members with our space. With your investment we can move Elephant Room Gallery beyond a store front and out into the community through innovative programs such as the Artist Assistance Program and the Intern Placement Program.</p>

<p><span>$15,000 will allow us to increase the number of exhibitions we put on per year from November 2012 to November 2013; strengthen our network by hosting events throughout Chicago; and ensure that each artist exhibition has a healthy marketing and promotion budget. Additionally, the funds will allow us to continue our Artist Assistance Program at no cost to the artists involved (currently they pay a nominal fee) and will expand our Intern Placement Program by reaching a larger artist and student audience through advertising. </span></p>

<p>If we do not reach our $15,000 goal, the funds donated will still make an impact on our organization as we work to increase our impact beyond our four walls. We will work to make up the remaining funds needed through our gallery sales to ensure that we stay on target with an increase in exhibitions and additional programming.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact </strong></p>
<p><span>Elephant Room has successfully provided an exhibition space for emerging artists as well as a venue for artists and designers to sell their work and retain a majority of the sale while gaining valuable exposure and experience. Our focus on under-represented local artists has had amazing impact on Chicago’s art scene as we bring more attention to these individuals and thus impact the direction of their careers. Our South Loop storefront has been the hub for gatherings of many kinds that have connected people in an artistic setting and has been a great art resource for the surrounding community of </span>students, residents and visitors. The Artist Assistance Program was developed in our second year and provides artists with that bit of extra help with both office and in-studio work that allows them to focus more on the creative and removes the overwhelming elements of self-promotion and marketing. After a year of running the Artist Assistance Program and meeting more and more artists and students who wanted to become involved, we started to pair interested students with individual artists who were in need of interns. During the summer of 2012, the Intern Placement Program was born. We are able to connect students with artists in order to provide both parties with the experience and time needed in order to further their careers in the art world.</p>

<p><span>With our limited budget, we have been able to build our exposure over the past few years and are now a recognizable name in many art circles. We receive several artist submissions per week as well as a lot of interest from both artists and students interested in our programs. We continue to operate on a smaller scale with 2-3 interns per semester so that we can focus on providing them with a valuable experience while still providing opportunities for the multitude of other applicants to work one on one with an artist for a semester. I am proud to say that our gallery interns continue to return and offer their assistance and support for our projects. This has been a testament to the value that our program provides. Emily Dahlquist, a Columbia College student, interned for us during the Spring Semester of 2012 and returned to see how she could help out over the summer. “9 months ago, I sat down with Kim, the owner of Elephant Room. I instantly felt that this was a genuine exchange and valuable opportunity for growth. The artist assistance program began the semester I started working there. Artists helping artists made for a perfect collaboration of business and artistic expression. I was placed with a local Chicago artist later on and in the past 3 months I’ve grown professionally more than I ever would have thought. I’ve gained hands on experience in my field and my eyes have been opened to so many amazing opportunities. I feel so much more advanced in my field and I can’t wait to see what’s ahead!” </span><span>- Dahlquist </span></p>
<p><span>We have received increased press for our exhibitions as we continue to push our activities out into the press world. </span></p>

<p>CR8 Gallery has received it's first <strong>Private Investor</strong>!   This moves the Gallery so much closer to a reality!</p>
<p>Seattle's <strong><em>Katwall</em></strong><em> </em>construction company just signed on as investors and they are incredibly excited to be on board!  They just completed work on the Greenest Commercial Building on earth called <strong>Bullitt Center</strong>, Seattle Washington</p>
<div>
<br/><h3>Why A Gallery?</h3>
<p>The experiences of food in a restaurant setting are full of rules and expectations.  My dining concepts need a platform of unlimited possiblilties.  The rules will be broken so the ideas have room to grow and give people new emotional experiences.  There is so much creativity in the form of design, art, music, nature, photography, architecture and food.  The line that brings them all together as one, will be drawn in CR8 Gallery.</p>
<h3><strong>So what is CR8 Gallery?</strong></h3>
<p>It's the first edible interactive gallery in the world. So imagine this...you enter the space and are bewildered by it's unorthodox creative installations.  In the midst of it, someone hands you a container and a utensil.  Then you get to taste the very artwork you are admiring.  This is just the beginning!</p>
<p>Creative and brilliant people need a place to come together to engage in and share new experiences.  Bellingham and the world will be eager to share something new and inspiring.</p>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>

<p>However the world of design and art had always fascinated me.  My life changed when I saw a photo of cutlery in Elle Decor magazine and I traveled all the way to Europe just to meet the designer.  This experience fueled the creative fire that allowed me to combine my extensive culinary training in Europe with my passion for incorporating art, design and food in way that has never been done before.</p>
<h3>What will happen there?</h3>
<p>Imagine a scenario of experiencing Alice In Wonderland but tasting what it would be like in the story!</p>
<p>Or imagine different Emotions that we have all had throughout our lives, captured in photos and paintings and translated to flavors and textures for you to experience as  you explore the gallery!</p>

<p>I began experimenting with those concepts in 2011 by forming in Los Angeles a dining group called ""CR8"" (pronounced ""Create"").  Since then I have done 8 conceptual dining installations, each completely unique in the way it shattered all rules!  Quickly CR8 became popular and recognized by people around the world.   </p>
<p>It became clear that CR8 needs a permanent home and CR8 Gallery is intended to be that place.  The dining concepts will change every few months and they will encompass some of the best local and global talent to manifest the vision.</p>

CR8 Gallery has received it's first Private Investor!   This moves the Gallery so much closer to a reality!
Seattle's Katwall construction company just signed on as investors and they are incredibly excited to be on board!  They just completed work on the Greenest Commercial Building on earth called Bullitt Center, Seattle Washington

Why A Gallery?
The experiences of food in a restaurant setting are full of rules and expectations.  My dining concepts need a platform of unlimited possiblilties.  The rules will be broken so the ideas have room to grow and give people new emotional experiences.  There is so much creativity in the form of design, art, music, nature, photography, architecture and food.  The line that brings them all together as one, will be drawn in CR8 Gallery.
So what is CR8 Gallery?
It's the first edible interactive gallery in the world. So imagine this...you enter the space and are bewildered by it's unorthodox creative installations.  In the midst of it, someone hands you a container and a utensil.  Then you get to taste the very artwork you are admiring.  This is just the beginning!
Creative and brilliant people need a place to come together to engage in and share new experiences.  Bellingham and the world will be eager to share something new and inspiring.
Who am I?
 My name is Roberto Cortez and I was a Private Chef for 15 years.  I had the honor of cooking for Microsoft’s Paul Allen, Antonio Banderas, Melanie Griffith and Eddie Murphy, and some of the worlds most influential musicians.
However the world of design and art had always fascinated me.  My life changed when I saw a photo of cutlery in Elle Decor magazine and I traveled all the way to Europe just to meet the designer.  This experience fueled the creative fire that allowed me to combine my extensive culinary training in Europe with my passion for incorporating art, design and food in way that has never been done before.
What will happen there?
Imagine a scenario of experiencing Alice In Wonderland but tasting what it would be like in the story!
Or imagine different Emotions that we have all had throughout our lives, captured in photos and paintings and translated to flavors and textures for you to experience as  you explore the gallery!



""Alice"",  By one of the worlds best photographers, Katarzyna Widmanska, will be part of the Sounds Of Wonderland Exhibition....
 


 These photos will be part of the first exhibition in the CR8 Gallery.  An exploration of emotions and flavors.

Who is involved?

There will be a plethora of designers from around the world showcasing their work here.  From Bellingham we have Greg Klassen designing the spectacular table.  From London, we have Andreas Fabian and his spectacular designs.  From Berlin we will have Hering and their magnificent porcelain.  This is just the beginning!
CR8 Dining Experimental

I began experimenting with those concepts in 2011 by forming in Los Angeles a dining group called ""CR8"" (pronounced ""Create"").  Since then I have done 8 conceptual dining installations, each completely unique in the way it shattered all rules!  Quickly CR8 became popular and recognized by people around the world.   
It became clear that CR8 needs a permanent home and CR8 Gallery is intended to be that place.  The dining concepts will change every few months and they will encompass some of the best local and global talent to manifest the vision.

<p>The 7 Deadly Sins series will consist of seven models each representing one of the 7 Deadly Sins: wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony. We will have various body painters that will each be designated one or more of the sins and will have open creativity to define their interpretation of that sin(s). My partner and I will be building a coffin designed not only for the series shoot but to take on art tours to be used as a photo booth for attendees to stand inside and get their photo taken.</p>
<p>The photo shoot will entail of the model climbing in the coffin and being shot from various angles. These photos will be done individually as well as composited into one larger photo with each coffin side by side.</p>

</div></div>","The Infinite Portal For Sunshine
 
A multi-aspect campaign that raises funds for 3 purposes:
 
 

 
 
 
 
~ A Burning Man art installation officially confirmed as part of Fractal Planet 2013, entitled: “The SunShrine” Memorializing everything that Sunshine Daydreamer was all about...
 
 
 
 
 
~ A two day gathering taking place two weeks after burning man, at both of his stomping grounds, MI and CA, simultaneously, by means of live streaming, on video projection screens on the sites, and live on the internet, so that friends and pham who can't make it to burningman and or the other side of the country, can be together in his honor...
 
 

~ And finally as a charity for his amazing mother Nancy, who is recovering from 2 back surgeries, and about to head overseas for her next teaching journey to Turkey this August....
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sunshine Daydreamer memorial fundraiser update #1:
 
Greetings friends and pham!
 
We wanted to give you all an update on the status of the project now that we are back from our 2 week journey at Electric Forest.
 
We are soo grateful for the recent outpouring of support and sharing all over the internets by such wonderful people... it means so much, please continue whenever you feel inspired to!
 
We have 2 points we wanted to address in this update:
 
1.) We know that some of you do not have access to a bank card, and we have devised a method for’ ya’ll to use cash, and have it end up showing up as a legitimate donation on the Indiegogo fundraising page.
 
.
 
2.) We wanted to make clear why our goal is what it is, and how the outlined budget adapts to the charity fund for Sunny’s Mother based on what we raise.

Our outlined budget does not reflect a certain amount that we are trying to raise for Nancy. Our intention is raise more than the goal, because if we do, Indiegogo only charges a 4% fee. If we do not reach the goal, they charge us 9% on whatever we raise.
 
We have planned for this possibility, by making our budget adaptable. The burning man memorial art installation can be scaled back to half the size, or scrapped altogether if the amount stays lower than say $5K for instance. We will still be able to throw the gathering, and give all of the remaining sum to Nancy.
 
However, we have our sights set high right now. With less than 40 days remaining, we would like to proceed with ordering a very small batch of test materials, and start getting our hands dirty building and perfecting a proof of concept test slice.
 
We would only need a couple hundred to start that crucial process, and we are almost there currently.

Nextly, to explain the cash donation method that we have come up with for those of you or your friends who don't have bank cards:
 
Any Bank of America branch in the country will allow a cash deposit into someone’s BoA checking account, provided you have that someone’s account number.
 
That someone will be Scotty, and then he will take that exact amount and donate it into the Indiegogo project as an official donation, which could include your name, or could remain anonymous.
 
If that sounds like it might work for you, please message either Scotty or Wolfgang on facebook.

WE LOVE YOU

 
 
^^^ END OF UPDATE #1 ^^^
 
 
About Sunshine:
 
 
 
Any of us who had the pleasure of being around Sunny would agree that he was one of the most inspiring people that we had ever experienced. His light was soo positive and powerfully beautiful.
 
 
 
He was all about infinite possibilities and co-creating with others in manifesting dreams, no matter how big they might have been.
 
 
 
When sunlight is split by a prism, the rainbow that lies within it is revealed. He revealed his inner rainbows to everyone he came in touch with.
 
 
 
He was here to help save the world with his spirit, and that hasn't changed. he knows it better than we do, and the handful of times where he has appeared to us in our dream state, glowing as bright as ever, proves that point.
 
 


 
Description of The Burning Man Art installation Memorial:
 
 
 
We are creating a playful yet reflective space, that outwardly reflects sunshine to people headed in any direction, and reveals  everyone's inner rainbow infinity on the inside, by way of the principle of the infinite mirror effect, combined with a flowy sea of furry, dreamy LED rainbows that literally have no end.
 
 
 
We won’t be burning the structure, because its is designed to be infinite, and travel wherever it is called to. the next destination will be his simulcasted portal gathering event, which is outlined above, and will take place 2 weeks after burning man. if you can't be there in person, you can still be there in spirit, due to the ""google hangouts on air"" internet broadcast, which is one of the rewards offered for supporting this memorial fundraising campaign.
 
 
 
Another reward is knowing that you are supporting his amazing mother Nancy in a time of need.
 
 
 
And yet another reward for supporting this will be getting to see this amazingly playful yet infinitely reflective art piece come into manifestation, in honor of the spirit of Sunshine Daydreamer.
 
 
 
Early Draft rendering at the below, the big video is coming soon!

<br/><br/><p> </p></span></div>","My name is Hromovy (hrah-MOE-vee)
I will be having a solo show in Chicago, Illinois at the Leather Archives and Museum, June 13th 2014.
 The Artist and Patron relationship has been a critical component of the creative process for hundreds of years in the history of art.  Patrons have provided the necessary financial support that has allowed artists to focus on creativity and freedom of expression while minimizing the distraction of outside influences.  Patrons have also helped create the public and private spaces to promote the Artist’s work so that others may benefit from their creativity as well. 
The Family Tree
The Family Tree will be a life sized installation piece created specifically for the exhibition.
 Using parts of images taken over the course of a year I will create a collage that becomes a crucified body. Each image will be of a person that is part of the leather community.
I intend to shoot as many different representatives of our community as possible.
  As a marginalized community, I believe we are ignored or reviled. My portraiture has always been about bringing dignity to those who often can't find acceptance in the world we live in.
My studio, DivaFoto uses the tag line; ""Glamour for the rest of us"". This piece will bring us together as a whole. What better place to premier it than the Leather Archives and Museum.
 

Mutagenesis /mu·ta·gen·e·sis : The formation/development of a mutation... and my latest series of work


While some images are more obvious than others, my intent is to create art that provokes and intrigues.
Much of my past work is very literal. I have taken documentary style images on 35 mm and large format film and combined them digitally with the purpose to explore the relationship of elements. 
 When creating these images I had no clear idea of the results I would achieve; I let the images do the talking. The individual elements were chosen for their contrasting nature.
The images were not created with a specific intent but rather by listening to what the individual pieces said when contrasting elements were brought together. Some images were shot specifically for the ""Mutagenisis"" series and others are from my archives or other project series. 
The introduction of electricity to the mix, in the form of a computer program, allowed me produce work that provides a fresh look at common objects.
 These digital double exposures have created much interest in my work since my successful solo show in Kansas City, MO in 2012.
All images are done in limited signed and numbered editions: Mutagensis is limited to 10 of each image. Family Tree will be a one off. Only one ever produced.

I received my first camera at the age of 5, was trained as an apprentice lapidary and jeweler from age 7 and have rarely held a “real” job.
I have received numerous awards for my 3D media artworks in: glass, metal, jewelry, and mixed media.
Having made the decision to concentrate solely on Photography, in 2000, I have been awarded various honors including:

3 images chosen as Kodak Image of the Day
A piece included in the Peabody/Essex museum (Salem, Mass) collection that details new trends in modern art.
I have shown in numerous juried exhibitions receiving awards in many of them.
I am the official photographer and documentarian for South Plains Leatherfest / International Master/slave weekend in Dallas, Texas.

What will your patronage support?

 $3950 is needed to produce the actual pieces to be installed. 
 $700 in shipping from San Antonio to Chicago
$1400 in travel and related expenses to collect the images for The Family Tree
$450 for promotional materials

 
Why doesn't my campaign ask for the full amount?
Of course I'm hoping for more donations than I'm asking. The percentage that is taken from the amount donated is higher if you don't meet your goal.  So setting a lower goal is a better financial decision.
The $4500 goal will make sure I can produce the actual art for the show. If I receive more than the goal that will cover more of the expenses I have estimated.  Should the funding exceed the estimated cost, I will be able to produce a larger installation and cover more of what I have already spent.
(As of the launch date, over $800)
Everyone is invited to the opening!
Updates will be posted here along with some of the new images as they are finished.
I understand the limitations of today's economy. If you could help by spreading the word of this project to your friends I would greatly appreciate your support in this way. Thank you for your interest in my work.

<h3>Our Story</h3>Hi, My name is Gretchen McLaren and I am a jeweler, blacksmith and yoga teacher from Raleigh, NC.  The plight of women and young girls in India is a story that deeply resonates with me.  <br/><br/>In one month's time, I will be moving to India for 6 months, volunteering with a group of orphanages in South India.  I will be setting up a studio at one of the orphanages, teaching the girls and village women how to make jewelry. Together we will design a line of jewelry that they will produce, and then I will bring the finished product back to the US to market, distribute and sell for them.  All the money from the sale of the line will go directly back to the women less material costs.  <br/><br/>My intention is to be of service to these women and girls and to create a sustainable, green business for them.  My work is completely volunteer based.  This $5,000 that I am asking is for travel and expenses to support me while I am working on this project for 6 months.  It is my hope that this campaign will exceed my wildest expectations and that I will also be able to buy additional tools and materials for the community.<br/><br/>We will start simple and small.  I will be taking one suitcase of tools and materials to set up the studio, but I am hoping that the project will grow in time and that the original studio will be better outfitted, and that we be able to replicate the project in 16 other orphanages in South India.<br/><br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<br/>
I will be teaching these women a marketable skill,
 thereby giving them a means so that they can provide for themselves. The impact of the hope project on these girls and women is tremendous.  With the income they earn from the sale of the jewelry line, they will be able to pay for their own education, support their families and provide a dowry for themselves.  <br/><br/>It is my goal to simply change the course of just one life.  If I reach that goal then I will feel like this project has been successful.  </div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>I was chosen by a non-profit organization to go on this trip and complete this project.  They are providing part of my airfare and room and board in the orphanage for 6 months.  There are expenses that are not being covered by this organization and that is why I am launching this campaign.  There will be no salary as this is completely volunteer.  I have given up my home, my studio and resigned from my jobs in order to go to do this.  To be clear, your contribution to this $5000 is allowing me to complete this journey.  A portion of this money will go towards purchasing a few extra tools and materials, and a laptop to teach, consult and start the business for this community.<br/><br/>Thank you gifts for contributing:<br/><br/>$25:  Mala Beads from India that have been blessed in the Holy Ganges personally by me <br/><br/>$100:  A piece from the girls jewelry line.  This special thank you piece will be separate from the line, made by me, in India, inspired by working with the girls.<br/><br/>$500: An Indian vegetarian meal cooked by me. </div><div><br/></div><div>$1000:  A private yoga class taught by me.</div><div>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p>Hello All!! Thank you for stopping by my indiegogo page. This page was made to help me fund gallery showings of my new  painting series, where I recreate romance novel covers to provoke dialogue on modern culture.  My purpose for doing this is to present the figures in these narrative paintings as symbols of power, identity, gender, race, class, culture, and ethnicity.  This show will be my final showing  as a graduate student at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia, PA, and I also have another showing in Columbus, OH.</p>
<p>The reason for my indiegogo page is to help me procure supplies for creating, storing, and renting a van to drive work to the gallery sites. I am also need to obtain 10ft. rolls of Tyvek 10gx and 107""in., seamless background paper to create new paintings on. The bulk of funding for helping me utilize a studio facility to paint the large scale pieces, and store them. This show is very important, not only to me and my practice, but I think it will definitely be a stepping stone for my career, and will help me become the painter and professional I know I can be.</p>
</div>
<div>All contributions are an investment into this project. The hope is for these paintings to provoke new dialogues on our identities. It is my snapshot of the human condition. Sometimes we are more complex than what we project to world, and sometimes we are not, and that is the balance of us as a people. In the end, the paintings celebrate our differences, and push us to celebrate love, life, our realities, and strives to present our authentic selves.</div>

<p> </p></div>","Overview:
Hello All!! Thank you for stopping by my indiegogo page. This page was made to help me fund gallery showings of my new  painting series, where I recreate romance novel covers to provoke dialogue on modern culture.  My purpose for doing this is to present the figures in these narrative paintings as symbols of power, identity, gender, race, class, culture, and ethnicity.  This show will be my final showing  as a graduate student at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia, PA, and I also have another showing in Columbus, OH.
The reason for my indiegogo page is to help me procure supplies for creating, storing, and renting a van to drive work to the gallery sites. I am also need to obtain 10ft. rolls of Tyvek 10gx and 107""in., seamless background paper to create new paintings on. The bulk of funding for helping me utilize a studio facility to paint the large scale pieces, and store them. This show is very important, not only to me and my practice, but I think it will definitely be a stepping stone for my career, and will help me become the painter and professional I know I can be.

All contributions are an investment into this project. The hope is for these paintings to provoke new dialogues on our identities. It is my snapshot of the human condition. Sometimes we are more complex than what we project to world, and sometimes we are not, and that is the balance of us as a people. In the end, the paintings celebrate our differences, and push us to celebrate love, life, our realities, and strives to present our authentic selves.

Launching in May 2013, our <a href=""http://artandolfaction.com/programs/residencies/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">residency program</a> will pair creative practitioners with fragrance professionals. Together, they will implement specific cross-genre creative projects that involve a strong olfactive element.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To help make this happen, we are creating an accessible space in downtown Los Angeles that provides support, experimentaton and access. This experimental laboratory will be supplied with scent-making supplies, a library and a classroom.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But, we need your help.</div>
<h3><strong>FIRST, A LITTLE ABOUT US.<br/></strong></h3>
<div>
<p>We're launching The Institue for Art and Olfaction to help support independent work in perfumery. We want to highlight the innovation and artistry in perfumery, to instigate greater engagement with the art and science around scent, to juxtapose it with other creative practices, and to bring it into the bigger world. We will do this through a public education program, by building an archive of contemporary perfume releases, by creating an accessible laboratory for scent experimentation, and – most importantly – by inciting cross-genre collaboration between perfumers and folks on the cutting edge of other fields.</p>
<div>In connecting these different types of people with olfactory experts, and in encouraging them to experiment outside of their comfort zones, we hope to facilitate strange and beautiful new projects. With our help, an aerospace engineer might collaborate with a perfumer to create a scent for outer space, a designer might develop a typeface around the idea of ‘gourmand’, or a homeless teenager might work with a molecular biologist to re-create the scent of fear at midnight.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's worth noting at this point that the IAO is a not-for-profit enterprise, <a href=""https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/fiscal/profile?id=7850"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fiscally sponsored by Fractured Atlas</a>, and wholly devoted to artistic experimentation and access.</div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<p><strong>WHY ARE WE DOING THIS, YOU ASK?<br/></strong></p>
<div>
<strong> </strong>We spent years trying to gain access to information and education about perfumery: It's pretty hard to come by, and tends to be rather exclusive. Populists at heart, we believe that perfumery is an art medium that deserves the attention of the greater public. So we've elected to provide the education and access ourselves.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our background in fine art also gives us the motivation to apply the tinkering artist mentality to scent. Rather than focussing on 'pretty' sellable scents, we are hoping to stretch the conceptual potential for perfumery by opening it up to folks outside the field.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are some incredible people working with perfume as an art form, but to our knowledge, we are the only space that allows this level of access to the practice. We're one of a kind!</div>
<h3>THIS CAMPAIGN</h3>
<p><strong>BRASS TACKS: THE LABORATORY.</strong><br/><br/>This campaign is about raising funds for a specific project: Launching an experimental perfume laboratory.</p>
<div> We have access to a robust perfumers' organ (check!), we have <a href=""http://www.lamart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our space </a>nailed down (check!). What we are missing are very specific things:
<div>
<ul>
<li>Chairs for the educational space</li>
<li>Laboratory tables</li>
<li>Large blackboards for your ideas</li>
<li>Scent-making equipment (atomizers! beakers! pipettes! mouillettes!)</li>
<li>Two iBalance scales</li>
<li>A mixer</li>
<li>Scent vials</li>
<li>And bits and pieces such as lights, and a houseplant</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>A creative space, our lab nonetheless has very specific goals. We will implement a program of public courses and events starting in March 2013, and - through our collaborative residency program -  the lab will host two trans-media art projects in 2013. In fact, we already launched our special projects: A collaboration with perfumer Josh Meyer and filmmaker Mark Harris. <a href=""http://artandolfaction.com/programs/special-projects/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Check it out here!</a>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are also hard at work creating community partnerships with underserved populations. Our hope is to introduce the art and science of perfumery to folks who would have little access to it. Our particular focus is on homeless teenagers.</div>
<div>
<br/>If you are curious about what the heck an experimental collaborative perfume lab might look like, are interested in seeing experimentation in scent, or just want to promote access to education... Well those are three very good reasons to fund us.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In exchange, we'll keep you involved in the process, and make sure you reap the benefits of our work. At the very least, you can consider yourself our elite test audience for a potentially amazing process. But there are also opportunities to become more involved. In fact, if you have questions you can email us anytime at <a href=""mailto:hello@artandolfaction.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hello@artandolfaction.com.</a>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>BUT, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT BOOKS?</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Part of our mission at IAO is to provide accessible education. The first step towards this is to build a lending library of scent-related books. We're starting small: We've asked our community on Facebook and our board of advisors to propose their suggestion of the essential books for scent education. We're hoping that you will help us purchase those books by, well, adopting them, one at a time.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We've added a new perk at $35: <strong>Adopt-a-book.</strong> When you kick in at this level you're not only allowing us to provide a well-curated selection of books to the folks coming through the IAO, you're also helping us build the infrastructure around the library.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When you adopt-a-book, we'll send you our wish list of recommended books, and you can choose the one you want to adopt. Or, suggest your own (scent-related, of course).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>ARE THERE RISKS TO ALL THIS? YOU BETCHA.</strong> <br/><br/>We are fully confident that we will be running a very successful arts organization by the end of 2013. But, like with any non-profit, there is a risk of failure.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Luckily, the challenges that the IAO faces relate entirely to the level of elbow grease we put in, not to mention our capacity to formulate and implement oblique solutions. Since we have the space, it becomes a question then of sustaining the effort.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, barring any natural disasters or acts of god, we have full confidence that we will be launching to the public, on schedule, by March 2013.</div>

<p></p>
<p>Hello, I am Susan Smereka. Many of you know my work and have supported my artistic endeavors over the years. I am grateful for the community that has kept me going while I have created art while working full-time.</p>
<p>Now I am thrilled to have a new opportunity for uninterrupted time to focus on my art making in the community of <a href=""http://newcitygalerie.org/artist-in-residence/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>New City Galerie</a> in Burlington, Vermont. My residency begins May 1st  and will culminate with a show in November 2015. T<span>he group show will feature book arts and </span><span>my new video installation.</span></p>
<b>I am seeking your help to make this possible.</b>
</div><div>
<p>I am hoping to raise $7,000 to take the time off from work and make the most of this expanse of time. The money will help to cover my living expenses as well as cost of art supplies. During the residency, I will create a body of new work described below. I will assist with the curating artists books for the culminating show. I also plan to organize and offer workshops on book arts.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>My work with book arts and hair drawing began in 2008 during my art residency at the Helen Wurlitzer Foundation in Taos, New Mexico. There, I began gluing hair on to paper and then later into blank journals. The meditative, methodical, repetitive process helped with the physical problems I was having at the time. I used the hair that I collected from my brush and the shower.  During that residency I also created a few unique hand bound wordless books. I explored different ways ink was absorbed into paper and cloth. I, then, complied them into hand bound unique books. They are about texture and nuance.<br/><br/><p>In 2009, I received a grant from the Vermont Arts Council to take a letterpress class in New York. From there, I interned with <a href=""http://www.classicletterpress.biz/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Classic Letterpress</a> in Oakland, CA (where it was located at the time). During this 7 month period, to deepen my practice, I served as a volunteer at the San Francisco Center For Book Arts. I tried my hand at altered books, book binding, cloth box building and letterpress books.</p>Video work has been an interest since 2005 when I worked in collaboration with Karen McGregor and Jane Horner on our collaborative video installation, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6CgOD7f9Sg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Hidden Room</a>. Since then I have experimented with the media and a handful of results have been posted my <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/smerekaful/videos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a> channel.<br/><br/>Monoprinting has come to me through a grant I received to work at <a href=""http://www.tworiversprintmaking.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Two Rivers Printmaking Studio</a> (TRPS) in White River Junction, Vermont. I have been printing since 2000 and have taught monoprinting workshops at both TRPS and at Burlington City Arts.<br/><br/><h2>THE WORK<br/>
</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Six months will allow me the time and the freedom to explore book arts, video, hair drawing and monoprinting, I enjoy the complexity that comes with a multitude of materials and ideas. My goal during this residence is to discover, or let surface, the relationships between these media. My list of things I would like to work on during my residency looks like this;</p>
<ul>
<li>compile 3 printed books from scanned drawings The drawings for these small (6"" x 6"") books originated from a year of <a href=""http://news.susansmereka.com/?p=48"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daily Drawings</a>  (2008-2009). I will have them them mechanically printed and perfect bound (a glued binding).<br/>
</li>
<li>create a new video inspired by ideas and concepts explored over 
the the last 4 years; for example one source are these photos I took of <a href=""http://susansmereka.com/svmanager/g15/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">windows </a>in San Francisco.

I will be creating an object/surface for the 
video to be projected on.</li>
<li>create a book of drawings and excerpts from my aunt's letters who passed away a number of years ago. This is a continuation of the work that I did with <a href=""http://susansmereka.com/svmanager/g16/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Repair""</a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>create several large scale hair drawings (the hair work will also figure into the video).<br/>
</li>
<li>work on large monoprints.<br/>
</li>
<li>assist with the curration of the show.</li>
<li>offer and organize book arts workshops.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the things I find
exciting about concentrated, focused time, in a lovely, new to me studio space is the gift of working through ideas and concepts more quickly.  <br/></p>
<h2><b>COMMUNITY AND CONNECTION </b></h2>
<p>It will be a inspiring opportunity to make more network with book artists in Burlington and throughout Vermont. I
will continue to work in the <a href=""http://www.burlingtoncityarts.org/print-studio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Burlington City Arts</a> printmaking studio to do the work on my monoprints. For my video work I will participate in Vermont Community Access Media's (<a href=""http://www.vermontcam.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">VCAM</a>) program which loans equipment and shares their expertise for airing on their TV channel (15). <br/></p>
<p>I will be growing community through the culminating exhibit, workshops on book arts, TV and the gallery. The community building aspect adds to the ongoing work
of artists that 

contribute to the vitality of Vermont. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>PERKS</h2>All the the perks are unique works of art (excluding the printed books). You can view some samples of the clothes pin drawings along with the installation <a href=""http://susansmereka.com/svmanager/g16/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Repair""</a>  I did in 2012. Images of the large, framed hair drawings can be seen <a href=""http://susansmereka.com/svmanager/g6/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.

This additional perk is a way to say how much it means to me that you believe in the importance of art and community.<br/><br/><p>Even if you can’t help financially, you can still help by passing the campaign on to others that might. Please sign up for my <a href=""http://news.susansmereka.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>blog</a> or send me a reply with your email so that I can keep you abreast of events as they approach.  Another way to show your support is to come to one of the workshops that will occur during my residency. Keep in mind that the show in November will have a call for artists who have books and related book ideas to share. I'll keep you posted on the workshops and the call to artists. I look forward to working with you in whatever way is presented.<br/>

I used the hair that I collected from my brush and the shower.  During that residency I also created a few unique hand bound wordless books. I explored different ways ink was absorbed into paper and cloth. I, then, complied them into hand bound unique books. They are about texture and nuance.In 2009, I received a grant from the Vermont Arts Council to take a letterpress class in New York. From there, I interned with Classic Letterpress in Oakland, CA (where it was located at the time). During this 7 month period, to deepen my practice, I served as a volunteer at the San Francisco Center For Book Arts. I tried my hand at altered books, book binding, cloth box building and letterpress books.Video work has been an interest since 2005 when I worked in collaboration with Karen McGregor and Jane Horner on our collaborative video installation, Hidden Room. Since then I have experimented with the media and a handful of results have been posted my youtube channel.Monoprinting has come to me through a grant I received to work at Two Rivers Printmaking Studio (TRPS) in White River Junction, Vermont. I have been printing since 2000 and have taught monoprinting workshops at both TRPS and at Burlington City Arts.THE WORK


Six months will allow me the time and the freedom to explore book arts, video, hair drawing and monoprinting, I enjoy the complexity that comes with a multitude of materials and ideas. My goal during this residence is to discover, or let surface, the relationships between these media. My list of things I would like to work on during my residency looks like this;

compile 3 printed books from scanned drawings The drawings for these small (6"" x 6"") books originated from a year of Daily Drawings  (2008-2009). I will have them them mechanically printed and perfect bound (a glued binding).

create a new video inspired by ideas and concepts explored over 
the the last 4 years; for example one source are these photos I took of windows in San Francisco.

I will be creating an object/surface for the 
video to be projected on.
create a book of drawings and excerpts from my aunt's letters who passed away a number of years ago. This is a continuation of the work that I did with ""Repair"".

create several large scale hair drawings (the hair work will also figure into the video).

work on large monoprints.

assist with the curration of the show.
offer and organize book arts workshops.


One of the things I find
exciting about concentrated, focused time, in a lovely, new to me studio space is the gift of working through ideas and concepts more quickly.  
COMMUNITY AND CONNECTION 
It will be a inspiring opportunity to make more network with book artists in Burlington and throughout Vermont. I
will continue to work in the Burlington City Arts printmaking studio to do the work on my monoprints. For my video work I will participate in Vermont Community Access Media's (VCAM) program which loans equipment and shares their expertise for airing on their TV channel (15). 
I will be growing community through the culminating exhibit, workshops on book arts, TV and the gallery. The community building aspect adds to the ongoing work
of artists that 

contribute to the vitality of Vermont. 

PERKSAll the the perks are unique works of art (excluding the printed books). You can view some samples of the clothes pin drawings along with the installation ""Repair""  I did in 2012. Images of the large, framed hair drawings can be seen here. Framed work includes these mixed media cloths pin drawings. I have both framed and unframed mixed media hair drawings.

                                                                                                        accordion hair book, 2009


                                                                                                               recycled journals, 2011

                                                                                      two unique hand bound books, 2010  
On the ""Gallery"" tab you will find images of work that fall into the perk for those of you that want to make a 'down payment'. (On the ""gallery"" tab there are also 2 videos of work I have done - one a video and one a documentation of a multimedia installation) For any of the perks, I would love for to you coming by my place to pick out exactly which piece you would like. I will include a 'surprise' (another work of art) with each contribution. This additional perk is a way to say how much it means to me that you believe in the importance of art and community.Even if you can’t help financially, you can still help by passing the campaign on to others that might. Please sign up for my blog or send me a reply with your email so that I can keep you abreast of events as they approach.  Another way to show your support is to come to one of the workshops that will occur during my residency. Keep in mind that the show in November will have a call for artists who have books and related book ideas to share. I'll keep you posted on the workshops and the call to artists. I look forward to working with you in whatever way is presented.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

we will find a way to make this work. PAINT DAY is Sunday, June 22, between 11am and 4pm.
Do you have building
owner approval?
- Yes, building developer Ron Hughes of Hughes Properties is
in full support of the project and we're working with his colleagues Pat Fix
and Sean Havera on logistics and execution.
Do you have city of
Ann Arbor approval?
- Yes, in particular with the help of the Public Art
Administrator (Aaron Seagraves), we've gotten green lights related to
insurance, permits, and zoning from all relevant City of Ann Arbor offices. 
What happens if it rains on paint day?
- Paint Day is Sunday, June 22 and our back-up plan is to do this mural on Sunday, June 29.
When will it be finished?
- This mural will be completed in one day...though muralist
Mary Thiefels will do touch-up work after all of the volunteers have left.
Will vandalism/tagging ruin it?
- No! A special coating will be applied to the mural that allows any vandalism or tags of spray paint/permanent marker to be easily washed off.THANKS SO MUCH for considering support of this project and for saying 'yes/shur!' to making Ann Arbor better. Feel free to share this with your friends, colleagues, and family too!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

---------------------------



The Project Proposal: 

FIRST MURAL: VETERANS MURAL 

The funds I'm raising is for a mural on this bridge. It measures close to 6'7"" x 48' (around 336 feet square). This mural will be located under the Ooltewah-Ringgold Rd bridge that leads the way to Veteran's Park. In our city we love and admire our Vets for this reason I want this mural to be the first one be painted. Do you know a local war hero? Would you like him/her to be part of the mural? Make a donation of $550 and provide me with his/her name and contact information. It will be my honor to portray the brave men and women who served our nation in various wars.
 

What if the contributions exceeds? 

That would be the best news ever!! An additional $6,895 will help us paint a second mural in the bridge near the Imagination Station (photo bellow). The wall measures 7' x 118 feet (around 826 square feet). This mural will depict the everyday outdoor activities seen in our community i.e. families walking, children playing, cyclist, runners, etc.   


If the total contribution adds up to $21,725 we will be able to paint all three murals. The third mural will be painted under the bridge that supports the rail road tracks near the beautiful stream. The wall measures 16' x 67' (around 1,072 square feet). This mural will honor our city's history of Native Americans and their culture.

The hot, highly fluid material leaves a smooth, skin like texture along the eruptive fissure.

The volcano will be illuminated by wall washer led lights, programmed to look like flowing lava. A hidden lava tube will lead you to a ladder, where you will begin a 22' climb to the top of the caldera and sacrifice yourself into mouth of the volcano. The only way down will be to take a leap of faith into the belly of the volcano via the ""drop slide of transformation"" which is at 22 foot high slide with a 10 foot vertical drop.</p><p>Inside the belly of the volcano will be an enclosed room. This will be a place of learning and sharing of the Hawaiian culture through hula dancing, hula pahu drums, story telling. Also inside will be an 8’ hula dancer making an offering to the Goddess Pele, sculpted by Marco Cochrane.  </p><p>And we can't forget the fire!

</p><p>The inspiration behind the project comes from my own process of transformation.  As a result of the abuse that I experienced in my childhood,  I came to believe that I deserved or should expect and keep quiet about abusive relationships with the men in my life. Unfortunately, alcoholism is a common thread among them too. I have spent the last year healing myself and re-discovering my inner strength as a woman, mother, lover and friend.

<p></p></div>","E Komo MaiWelcome to Paha'oha'o pronounced - Pa-HA-oh-HA-ohThe Hawaiian translation of Paha'oha'o is transformation. Transform into something more beautiful or elevated.In Hawaii, eruptions are viewed as beneficial, as acts of creation, and Hawaiians often see their lives mirrored in the level of volcanic activity.On those islands, an eruption usually begins with lava gushing from a long crack in the earth. The hot, highly fluid material leaves a smooth, skin like texture along the eruptive fissure. Because the structure is reminiscent of a huge vagina, native Hawaiians traditionally regarded an eruption as the menstruation of the goddess Pele, with the red lava always flowing toward the sea, the same path taken in ancient times by women to cleanse themselves.                                    What It Will Look LikePaha'oha'o will be a 30' tall by 50' in diameter volcano with a 10' vertical drop slide. The inner structure will be composed of wood, and the exterior covered in layered burlap to mimic molten lava. The volcano will be illuminated by wall washer led lights, programmed to look like flowing lava. A hidden lava tube will lead you to a ladder, where you will begin a 22' climb to the top of the caldera and sacrifice yourself into mouth of the volcano. The only way down will be to take a leap of faith into the belly of the volcano via the ""drop slide of transformation"" which is at 22 foot high slide with a 10 foot vertical drop.Inside the belly of the volcano will be an enclosed room. This will be a place of learning and sharing of the Hawaiian culture through hula dancing, hula pahu drums, story telling. Also inside will be an 8’ hula dancer making an offering to the Goddess Pele, sculpted by Marco Cochrane.  And we can't forget the fire! During the week fire will shoot out the mouth of the volcano. On Thursday we will burn the whole thing to the ground for the ultimate cleansing.The Inspiration

The inspiration behind the project comes from my own process of transformation.  As a result of the abuse that I experienced in my childhood,  I came to believe that I deserved or should expect and keep quiet about abusive relationships with the men in my life. Unfortunately, alcoholism is a common thread among them too. I have spent the last year healing myself and re-discovering my inner strength as a woman, mother, lover and friend. I have learned so much about myself through this period of reflection. This volcano is my way of saying good bye to the past and embracing my new beginning. Some may say that I'm like a Phoenix rising out of the ashes...but since I am Hawaiian, I will sacrifice myself to the volcano and come out cleansed and transformed, ready to create a new truth about myself.  We all have baggage from our past and my hope is to encourage people to let go of the pain and hurt in their past and transform their lives for the better.    
Please join us in support of all the women and men brave enough to rise above the abuse that so many of us have experienced in our lives, and to everyone that is ready to make a transformation.The CrewI spent the last year contributing to Truth is Beauty and the Bliss Dance Project.

Help us further liberate local airwaves from commercial control. Just like you can't have too many local coffee shops or startup restaurants, you can not have too many local commercial-free radio stations.Freeform, or freeform radio, is a radio station programming format in which the DJ is given total control over what music to play, regardless of music genre or commercial interests. Freeform radio stands in contrast to most commercial radio stations, where DJs have little or no influence over programming structure or playlists. In the United States, freeform DJs are still bound by Federal Communications Commission regulations.Freeform Portland (KFFP) has a permit from the FCC to utilize a non-commercial low-power FM (LPFM) radio channel in Portland. KFFP is being created by a group of volunteers who are waaaaaay-into freeform stations like WFMU, KXLU, KALX, & KFJC, and have tons of prior college and community radio experience. Our volunteers work directly with All Classical, KBOO, KMHD, XRAY.fm, House of Sound, Portland Radio Project, Wild Planet Radio and Vancouver Radio Project. We've also got radio family at KPSU, KRRC and Mt Hood Community College. We love radio. We love Portland.

Another time I ate a curb in a snow storm and had to replace a rim on my truck. The list goes on, people; and it only gets sadder and more pathetic. We are talking broken A/C kind of misery here. </h3>
<p>You see, tattoos aren't cheap. They usually run about $100 an hour and the design I want will be around a 3 hour piece, possibly broken into two sessions of 1.25 - 1.5 hours. Normally I'd only post this at $300 to cover it, but the minimum is $500 and they take 9% anyway so what the hell? Any amount raised over the actual cost of the tattoo will be donated to a charity that supports the victims of the Aurora Shooting. </p>
<p>You might be thinking ""why not live the American dream and charge that bad boy?"" I'll tell you why not: tattoo artists only take cash. Not very trusting souls, are they? I know, I know. If I can't raise enough for the whole tattoo, the money will get added to the tiny bit I've been able to set aside and I'll get whatever work I can done.

</h3>
<p>Hello, Indiegogo fans! I'm Amy and I make fused art glass, with emphasis on the colorful and sparkly. Examples include dishes and vases, suncatchers and ornaments, coasters, night lights, garden stakes, and even wind chimes.</p><p><img alt=""image depicting examples of my fused art glass"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463094166/indiegogo_lead_image_xchilf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
<span style=""font-size:12px;"">A few examples of my glass</span></p>
<p>It's a hobby I really love, but it leaves me with a lot of art glass I don't know what to do with. I already have a full-time job, so trying to make a living selling it isn't my best option. But I think that if I did sell it I could generate enough income to make a difference to someone else.</p>
<p>So I have founded Clear Purpose Glass. <b>The purpose of Clear Purpose Glass is to sell art glass to generate money for worthwhile nonprofits.</b><br/>
</p><h3>How it works<br/>
</h3>
<p>Let's say you visit my booth at an art show  and make a $10 purchase. $1 of that amount goes to the nonprofit, or even more later after I've recouped some of my startup costs. The rest goes to me to pay for the raw materials and expendables. You get not only the glass at a fair price, but the satisfaction of knowing that you did a good thing for someone else. I get to keep my day job, and also my fun hobby. The nonprofit organization gets a donation. And everyone's happy.<br/></p>
<h3>What is needed<br/>
</h3>
<p>The one piece that's missing, that I can't cover in this funding model, is a part of the startup cost. I've already pieced together a little minimalist studio in my basement. But there are a couple of big expenses that have presented a real challenge, and they are the most basic expenses of all -- <b>a kiln so I can fire the glass, and an art show tent and some tables so I can sell the glass.</b></p>
<p>I have started out using a rented kiln at an art school. I have to drive an hour to get there, and the glass that I had carefully cut and glued will often fall apart in the car. And the rental fees are prohibitive -- $40 per firing. Renting kiln space has enabled me to learn the basics of glass making, but it's certainly not a sustainable business model. A kiln at home is crucial.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463104231/GlassInRentedKilnCropped_cqkhct.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
<span style=""font-size:12px;"">Some of my glass loaded into a rented kiln</span></p>
<p>Once I make the glass, I have to sell it. Most art shows require a tent and they all require tables. If I have those two things, I finish putting together all the booth furnishings myself with a little imagination and elbow grease, and I'm in business!<br/></p>
<h3>How much is needed?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Here is the cost breakdown:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>$2,800 kiln (Paragon clamshell kiln with shipping)</li>
<li>$350 tent (including transport case and sidewalls -- these events are “rain or shine!”)</li>
<li>$250 tables (five 2'x4' tables to accommodate any art show layout)</li>
</ul>If I receive more than $3,400, I will be able to escalate my expansion to online selling, and generate donations  year ‘round. Very exciting!<br/><p></p><h3>Easy ways to help<br/>
</h3>
<p>If you donate to this campaign, I’ll thank you with some of my hand 
crafted art glass. See the sidebar on this page for all the colorful and
 sparkly options.</p>
<p>If you are short on funds but big on heart, you can still help! Just use the Indiegogo share tools to help me get the word out. Thank you for your kindness.</p></div>","Clear Purpose Glass: beautiful art glass, worthwhile causes

But there are a couple of big expenses that have presented a real challenge, and they are the most basic expenses of all -- a kiln so I can fire the glass, and an art show tent and some tables so I can sell the glass.
I have started out using a rented kiln at an art school. I have to drive an hour to get there, and the glass that I had carefully cut and glued will often fall apart in the car. And the rental fees are prohibitive -- $40 per firing. Renting kiln space has enabled me to learn the basics of glass making, but it's certainly not a sustainable business model. A kiln at home is crucial.
Some of my glass loaded into a rented kiln
Once I make the glass, I have to sell it. Most art shows require a tent and they all require tables. If I have those two things, I finish putting together all the booth furnishings myself with a little imagination and elbow grease, and I'm in business!
How much is needed?

Here is the cost breakdown:

$2,800 kiln (Paragon clamshell kiln with shipping)
$350 tent (including transport case and sidewalls -- these events are “rain or shine!”)
$250 tables (five 2'x4' tables to accommodate any art show layout)
If I receive more than $3,400, I will be able to escalate my expansion to online selling, and generate donations  year ‘round. Very exciting!Easy ways to help

If you donate to this campaign, I’ll thank you with some of my hand 
crafted art glass. See the sidebar on this page for all the colorful and
 sparkly options.
If you are short on funds but big on heart, you can still help! Just use the Indiegogo share tools to help me get the word out. Thank you for your kindness.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>With backgrounds in both visual art and English literature, one of the concepts that bridges our two perspectives is the belief that criticism and theory are underrepresented in our fields. Opportunities for artists and writers often take the form of calls for creative works such as short stories, poetry, or painting. We want to provide a forum where thinkers and makers can explore critical discourse in an accessible manner. We want to use books to share this work with the world in a way that allows it to be collected, lent, reread, loved, and passed down.

<p>We spent most of the summer traveling in Europe and forging connections with a large number of art galleries. One of the amazing things that stood out about European art spaces was that every gallery had a bookstore section, and they were taken very seriously. We want writers from Wichita and surrounding areas to have a place in this culture, to share ideas with the world, and to close the gap between midwestern “flyover” country and a worldwide conversation. One of the great things about local art space Harvester Arts is the practice of bringing art to Wichita from all over the country; in a way this project is an effort to establish the reverse direction, providing an outlet for Kansas voices to reach the art communities of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>We are currently seeking funding to pay for printing and shipping. We plan to find inexpensive analog publishing methods, potentially buying a used Xerox machine or similar, and assemble each edition by hand in our living room.

With some success we hope to expand the project to include multilingual editions, and we will pay for translation services when possible.</p>
<p>Our first edition will be invitational, and with enough interest we could move to an open-call format.</p>

with artists who are laying their livelihoods on the line in the pursuit of making something meaningful. These people want to make art that tells a story, and I want to tell their stories.  I want Begelbyte to be an online media platform that highlights emerging artists and their work. I want Begelbyte to be a place followers can visit to see what is transpiring in the cultural playground that is New York City. Most importantly,  I want Begelbyte to become a resourceful network for artists to find each other. As a NYU Tisch trained actress, theater educator at Manhattan's Atlantic Theater Company, and every day NYC art scene hustler,  I have been profoundly inspired by the passion of those around me. I want to share their pursuit of passion with you.</p>
<p>This project is important to me because I want to show that art is an equalizer. By that, I mean that art makes everyone that pursues creating it or views and interprets it valuable.   Moreover, this project is important to me because I have bet a lot (pretty much all) of my livelihood on telling stories. As an actress, writer, and teacher, I believe from my core that the most successful people on this planet (no matter how you measure success) are who they are because they never stop telling stories. Whether it be about what they love, what they hate, or what they worship, stories are how they express their deepest desires. Help me build a platform that curates those stories and exposes those desires.</p>
</div><div> <p>I am looking to raise $10,000 to build this platform. </p>

<li>Photography fees</li> <li>Day of production costs (transportation, food, props, incidentals)</li>
<li>Site advertisement </li> </ul>
<div>
In the near future (a couple of projects are
already in the works), I aim to pair Begelbyte
with artists who are looking to shoot fresh content for their existing or
start-up brands in new and exciting ways. In the digital age, everyone can use
a brief video, be it two minutes or ten minutes, explaining who they are or
what they do or that perhaps details a specific new project. We will create
scripted shorts, video campaigns, interactive sketches, visual tutorials, or
any sort of virtual content that a modern creative could need. Along with
selling advertisement space, this is the way that the site will be able to produce income.
A team or product will come to me, ask for a piece that features their work,
and my team will execute a video that promotes their passion project. But
before I can monetize my producing videos for artists and highlight more emerging talents, I need to have a few
more examples of what I can achieve. On a <i>nominal</i>  budget, my team and I
have managed to shoot our first five pieces.  Those pieces are shown in the above video. We have the heart and the chutspa, now we're just looking for a little $ help. <br/>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to look at this. My name is Kurt and I'm a 26 year old from North Dakota who has fallen in love with tattoos. My last one was over two years ago, but since then I have been wanting to get another done. The problem has been that I did not want just anything to be put permanently onto my body. During the entire time I searched for ideas that had meaning to me, I was busy saving money for the day when I would finally figure out what I wanted. Unfortunately, with my concept in mind, events have transpired such that I find myself woefully short of money. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In the last year, I have racked up bills due to eye surgery and ER visits. All told, I have accrued $4,000 worth of medical bills, wiping out all the money I had saved for the tattoo to try and pay those down. I was told by a friend that there are generous souls on the internet willing to donate to a cause; so, I have come to plead my case and ask for help. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The tattoo concept is a half-sleeve tattoo covering my left arm, beginning at the elbow and covering the upper arm and spilling over onto the shoulder. The centerpiece of the tattoo is being worked on by an artist currently, and the concept design is an ouroboros (signifying the circle/cycle of life, balance, and the world) enclosing a triskelion (signifying perpetual motion/progress and the symbolic representation of past/present/future). Surrounding this central symbol will be an abstract design signifying the chaos of the sky/heavens. <br/></p>
</div><div><p><br/></p></div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>This is a major project and will require quite a bit of money to complete. All of the funds will be going towards paying the tattoo artist who is actually putting the ink on my skin. If I have extra money following the completion of the tattoo, I will spend that extra money on a nice gift for the design/concept artist. She is a terrific person, and I'm hoping to be able to do something for her!<br/><br/>If I am unable to hit the target goal, then I will be using what donations I get to start the tattoo. The central piece of ouroboros and triskelion will be the first item to be done and can stand on its own, but would look better in the full concept. Whatever funds are left over after that initial design is completed will be used to start additional sections of the tattoo. This will be a project that I plan on completing over time until I am satisfied with the end result and as such I plan on completing it, just with donations that completion will come a whole lot faster than potentially needing to work on it over a decade! <br/><br/>All donations will help me complete a dream of mine, but I am not going to simply ask for donations without offering anything back to the community! My plan is to chronicle the tattooing process through pictures and in a written journal. Donators will be able to follow the progress of the tattoo over time and watch as the concept artist completes the design, and then be able to see that design go from concept to actual ink on my skin. <br/><br/>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Please help me get the word out to others! If all you do is simply forward my page on to others that you know, then that is more than enough to help me out.

</ul></div>","What’s Happening at The
Hatchery?
 
Ruin, regret, nostalgia:
artists love this stuff. For The Hatchery: East of Fresno, forty contemporary artists from Europe, the US, and
California will make work in direct (or oblique) dialogue with the unique
layered past found in the ruins of two failed intentional communities. It will
be a temporary artists’ occupation of the property—you could say that a
purposeful art community is being formed. Like a colony of ants, we as artists
and curators are working together to transform this place, and now we are
asking you to work with us!
 
The compound is located east
of Fresno, in the rural backwater of Badger, California. It stands in stark
contrast with its setting, the foothills of the spectacular Sierra Nevada
mountains. The West Coast and East Coast curators hope that by pointing the way
“east of Fresno” it can again become a significant site of experience. Perhaps
something truly marvelous is “that way.”
East of Fresno is the second exhibition in the ongoing creative use
of this property in its present, dilapidated state. Last year’s show, The
Hatchery: Free Range, was the
cooperative effort of twelve California artists with a vision for the site as
an arts venue. 
 
We think it’s all pretty
cool, but don’t take our word for it—come to Badger and find out for yourself! The
Hatchery: East of Fresno will
culminate in a free, two-day art and performance event on September 24 and 25,
2011.

History of the Site:
Intentional Communities in Badger
 
Built by Synanon as a drug
rehabilitation center and now largely a ruin, the Hatchery is located in
Badger, California near Sequoia Kings Canyon National Park. Its current moniker
comes from the Synanon practice of raising children communally in what was
dubbed the “Hatchery.” Synanon, although progressive in its time for its
culture of racial integration and its drug treatment technique, fell into
disrepute as its founder became delusional and authoritarian. 
 
The property was subsequently
re-purposed as a Muslim religious community and boarding school for children
from Oakland’s violent streets, but was abandoned after 9/11 amid accusations
of fraud.

 
Why support an artists’
temporary occupation at the Hatchery?
 
The Hatchery site has been a
veritable ghost town since it was last abandoned in 2001, and visiting it has
become a fascinating experience. Ten years of human neglect have encouraged
nesting birds, mushrooms and moss, and cattle seeking shade, overtaking
structures intended for people. Human histories are physically layered
throughout the space—schoolbooks, homework, lesson plans on walls, the remains
of a recording studio and a commercial kitchen, carefully chosen design. It is
an archeological dig, but the ruins are of our own time. You get a clear sense
that things didn’t work out: what happened here? what went wrong?
 
For artists, the Hatchery is
a venue unlike any other—ruined, huge, open for so many interpretations, no
rules, no restrictions—to explore, exhibit in, and interact with. The social,
physical, and natural layers become lenses through which art is made. The
artists of East of Fresno are
invited to confront and elucidate the lingering questions, and possibly invoke
new ones. Provocative, disturbing, and eye-opening, it’s a sensory and pyschic
adventure for artist and viewer alike. 
 
 
The Impact
 
Thanks to visionary artists

<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span"">The Temple of Transition<br/></font></h3>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"">Now that we are back from playa, with our warehouse nearly cleaned and our tools all boxed for next year, your Temple crew has one last job to do before we can finally decompress. With the default world now truly closing in around us, and with its realities poking through the afterglow of the Temple experience, we now need to close our books and settle the many outstanding bills that still remain. Creating the Temple of Transition was not an easy task, and we decided to focus on the Temple and its effect rather than worry about money: but now, we are staring into a gaping hole.</font></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"">We hope you enjoyed your Temple - and we have been humbled, awed, and delighted by the overwhelmingly positive response the entire community had to this enormous labor of love. But now that we've finally received every remaining bill &amp; invoice, we are around $40000 short: a terrifying amount for a crew that maxed their cards months ago. <br/></font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span""><br/></font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"">This was an enormous project and all the components 
really began to add up. We know that we have asked for your support all 
summer long, and so appreciate your help in meeting all of our previous 
campaign goals. This is the last one. <br/></font></p>
<p><br/></p>

Now that we are back from playa, with our warehouse nearly cleaned and our tools all boxed for next year, your Temple crew has one last job to do before we can finally decompress. With the default world now truly closing in around us, and with its realities poking through the afterglow of the Temple experience, we now need to close our books and settle the many outstanding bills that still remain. Creating the Temple of Transition was not an easy task, and we decided to focus on the Temple and its effect rather than worry about money: but now, we are staring into a gaping hole.

We hope you enjoyed your Temple - and we have been humbled, awed, and delighted by the overwhelmingly positive response the entire community had to this enormous labor of love. But now that we've finally received every remaining bill & invoice, we are around $40000 short: a terrifying amount for a crew that maxed their cards months ago. 

This was an enormous project and all the components 
really began to add up. We know that we have asked for your support all 
summer long, and so appreciate your help in meeting all of our previous 
campaign goals. This is the last one. 

We don't think it's fair for us to ask the community for the entire amount, so we're asking for half of what we owe, $20000, in this campaign. We literally have no money left, and so we can't afford to offer any schwag - rather, all we have to offer is our gratitude. We know that the ENTIRE Burning Man community made it out to this year's Temple, so if half of the community thinks the Temple experience was worth a single dollar, we'd nearly be home free. No matter how much or how little you can give, please do consider helping this one last time - we've given everything we could, and have nothing left to give ourselves, but it was worth it!


We want to share some wonderful stories that have come from fellow burners about what the Temple meant for them. We are overwhelmed with the emotions and feedback from so many, and the afterglow has us in awe. We hope that you will join in with your story of how the Temple has affected you. Please share your impressions and adventures. Did you get married there? Enjoy the sunrise? Bump into a long lost friend? Dance to the Gameletron? Say goodbye to a loved one passed? Breath in the Earth Harp? We would love to hear from you.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>LOOPOOL (aka Jean-Paul Garnier) is a sound artist based in Los Angeles and has been active since 1998.  While his focus is on experimental music, astronomy is a huge inspiration and he feels that the destiny of human beings lies in space.  LOOPOOL's picture was flown on the Space Shuttle Mission STS-134 as part of the Face in Space public outreach program and he has contributed to the Space Rocks program, both run by NASA.  LOOPOOL is also a member of the National Space Society and a supporter of the Mars Society.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Naming a Star is completely a subject of vanity and holds no consequence in the scientific community. The company that does this (starregistry.com) is not recognized by the <a href=""http://www.iau.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">International Astronomical Union</a> which is in charge of naming astronomical objects.  The reason for doing this project is to raise awareness about astronomy.  It is anticipated that the goal will not be met and that is great because if it is not then the money will be donated to SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence).<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>The deluxe package for naming a Star after LOOPOOL would cost about $550 (although it would only be lip service).  The main reason for this is to either have a Star falsely named after LOOPOOL or more reasonably to raise money for the SETI program.  Since there are Billions of Stars it is highly likely that we are not alone in the Universe, we should try and find our fellow beings of intelligence and communicate with them!  Everyone that donates will receive LOOPOOL merchandise as a reward!<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>More important than this fundraiser you can get involved with SETI through a program released to the public called seti@home.  With this program you can donate your computer's unused processing power to sift through radio signals detected by the SETI program and possibly find an alien signal!  Hook up to it here: <a href=""http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/</a><br/></p>

<h3>Our Ladies of South 4th Street is a company.</h3>
<div>But we don't sell anything. We do, however, make art. And we show it to you for free. See our website for the full details of our manifesto, but here it will suffice to say that we sponsor all charitable artists to share their work in a community unafraid of reverence. And that sponsorship takes some funding.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Because there's more to Our Ladies than the free performances that we host to sway your spirits. As our scrappy company tries to make a splash in the Brooklyn arts scene, we need some starting capital to invest in chairs, microphones, a projector for film screenings, promotional materials like stickers and postcards, lighting...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And you can help us make that happen. </div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By providing funds for production equipment and events, we can give our artists--who are performing for free and from the heart--the basic tools to bring their vision to you. Photographers want to show you their work on real photo paper, actors want a microphone to make even their whispers heard in the very back of the room, and all artists want word of their work to reach new audiences. To all those ends, your contribution makes a HUGE difference.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've set the budget for the fall season at $1,000--which works out to about $330 per month. So far we've been able to get everything we need, but for November and December we need:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>-a projector and screen for a film screening</p>
<p>-more lumber for building a custom sheet-screen</p>
<p>-250 more promotional stickers and postcards with our new website</p>
