<h3>What's It About?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>18 Million Second Picture Palette</b></i><br/>by Masha Stenina</p>
<p><i>We do not have to visit a madhouse to find disordered minds; our planet is the mental institution of the universe. (Goethe)</i></p>
<p><i><a href=""http://18millionsecondpicturepalette.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://18millionsecondpicturepalette.tumblr.com/</a></i><br/></p>
<p>Theo
 is a 31 year-old man who is one of the first “genetically modified 
humans”, in that he has three sets of DNA due to his mother’s 
infertility and the introduction of mitochondria from a female donor. 
After it was discovered that he had a birth defect (lack of a fibula) 
and that he would suffer from resulting osteosarcoma, the mother that 
carried him couldn’t handle the “experiment gone wrong” and left him to 
be raised by the social worker that was originally involved in his 
creation. While still young, he is eventually reunited with his little 
brother (who is NOT genetically modified and is essentially an accident)
 because of his biological mother’s drug use and fall from grace, only 
to lose him in a freak dry-drowning accident. The memory of his little 
brother, a “normal” version of himself continues to plague him. The day 
the little boy went under in the pool and Theo pulled him out plays in 
his mind repeatedly, interfering with his life and work. At times he 
feels as though he had saved himself from drowning only to die quietly 
in the night. </p>
<p>Theo lives in a rather mediocre part of New Jersey 
called Saintsboro in a rather mediocre townhome with a rather mediocre 
girlfriend. He takes a tourist bus for almost two hours into Manhattan 
daily to work for a technology /bio-engineering company as a developer, 
or rather someone who is able to meditate in order to conjure up vivid 
images that are then translated to a video image and recorded. His 
illness and physical deterioration begin to have an effect on his 
ability to “filter” out his personal fears about death and memories of 
his brother when he is hooked up to the machine. As he struggles to come
 to terms with his imminent mortality and the weight of his childhood, 
he becomes disillusioned by the technology, which is in its final stages
 of development with the ultimate goal of creating “films” of an 
individual’s thoughts, imagination, memories.</p>
<p>As a result of his 
inability to rationalize his own purpose in what seems like an 
increasingly complex yet sterile world, he begins to pursue a more 
withdrawn, careless, callous second life, full of unfulfilled attempts 
to be wildly promiscuous and irresponsible, to the point of trying to 
commit murder. He meets an unlikely friend, an older woman who doesn’t 
seem to be aware of her age or her wildly unconventional ways. Whether 
he develops a romantic relationship with her is hard to say, but the 
woman fully adopts him in his vulnerability, arguably with ulterior 
motives, and she aids him in preparing for death. As a last attempt of 
“fixing” his germline he (against his new friend and mentor’s advice) 
enters a trial where a 47th chromosome is introduced that can carry the 
genetic “fix” he needs. 
</p>
<p>Will Theo survive his own life, and if he does, will he ever
be “fixed”?</p>
<br/><p></p>

<h3>Why Do You Need My Money?<br/>
</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Immediate funding is needed to hire a kick@$$ editor to help me tie up my novel and make it absolutely 100% cutting edge.

18 Million Second Picture Paletteby Masha Stenina
We do not have to visit a madhouse to find disordered minds; our planet is the mental institution of the universe. (Goethe)
http://18millionsecondpicturepalette.tumblr.com/
Theo
 is a 31 year-old man who is one of the first “genetically modified 
humans”, in that he has three sets of DNA due to his mother’s 
infertility and the introduction of mitochondria from a female donor. 
After it was discovered that he had a birth defect (lack of a fibula) 
and that he would suffer from resulting osteosarcoma, the mother that 
carried him couldn’t handle the “experiment gone wrong” and left him to 
be raised by the social worker that was originally involved in his 
creation. While still young, he is eventually reunited with his little 
brother (who is NOT genetically modified and is essentially an accident)
 because of his biological mother’s drug use and fall from grace, only 
to lose him in a freak dry-drowning accident. The memory of his little 
brother, a “normal” version of himself continues to plague him. The day 
the little boy went under in the pool and Theo pulled him out plays in 
his mind repeatedly, interfering with his life and work. At times he 
feels as though he had saved himself from drowning only to die quietly 
in the night. 
Theo lives in a rather mediocre part of New Jersey 
called Saintsboro in a rather mediocre townhome with a rather mediocre 
girlfriend. He takes a tourist bus for almost two hours into Manhattan 
daily to work for a technology /bio-engineering company as a developer, 
or rather someone who is able to meditate in order to conjure up vivid 
images that are then translated to a video image and recorded. His 
illness and physical deterioration begin to have an effect on his 
ability to “filter” out his personal fears about death and memories of 
his brother when he is hooked up to the machine. As he struggles to come
 to terms with his imminent mortality and the weight of his childhood, 
he becomes disillusioned by the technology, which is in its final stages
 of development with the ultimate goal of creating “films” of an 
individual’s thoughts, imagination, memories.
As a result of his 
inability to rationalize his own purpose in what seems like an 
increasingly complex yet sterile world, he begins to pursue a more 
withdrawn, careless, callous second life, full of unfulfilled attempts 
to be wildly promiscuous and irresponsible, to the point of trying to 
commit murder. He meets an unlikely friend, an older woman who doesn’t 
seem to be aware of her age or her wildly unconventional ways. Whether 
he develops a romantic relationship with her is hard to say, but the 
woman fully adopts him in his vulnerability, arguably with ulterior 
motives, and she aids him in preparing for death. As a last attempt of 
“fixing” his germline he (against his new friend and mentor’s advice) 
enters a trial where a 47th chromosome is introduced that can carry the 
genetic “fix” he needs. 

Will Theo survive his own life, and if he does, will he ever
be “fixed”?


Why Do You Need My Money?


Immediate funding is needed to hire a kick@$$ editor to help me tie up my novel and make it absolutely 100% cutting edge. In the interest of not biting off more than I can chew, I am asking for your support in helping me with this step of the novel birthing process. I am interested in either self-publishing OR indie publishing my novel, and any funding raised beyond the cost of an editor will be used for design/printing/marketing and distribution costs.



Why is It So Darn Important?

Because the world is a crazy place and it's only getting crazier. Because we need each other. And because as artists we MUST support other artists and continue to talk about our projects and their importance. Because the written word HAS and WILL change the world.

Well, as you might've read at the top, Grimluk is an orc. He's big, he's
 green, he's strong, and he strives to help people, namely by killing 
demons with a revolver, a knife, and years of training and experience. I
 called the first one a weird western, but the better fitting 
description is sixguns and sorcery. Imagine a gunslinging Conan of 
Cimmeria wandering around a world more akin to America's Old West than 
pre-history, fighting eldritch abominations, corrupted mortals, 
monsters, and the struggle to help people.</p><p>Now, a lot of fine 
folks helped me bring the first book to life but there were some things 
missing. Namely, an editor and a touch more artwork. That's where this 
campaign comes in. With your help, I can have a properly edited book, a 
cover, and promotional artwork. The former will make this book that much
 more of an enjoyable read, while the latter will help me in the long

$2000 broken down as follows:</p><ul>
<li>$400 - Editing from Dominion Editorial</li>
<li>$600 - Artwork &amp; Cover from Bob Kehl</li>
<li>$800 - Production costs. This entails things like the actual

<li>8-10% of total funding for fees.</li>

Well, as you might've read at the top, Grimluk is an orc. He's big, he's
 green, he's strong, and he strives to help people, namely by killing 
demons with a revolver, a knife, and years of training and experience. I
 called the first one a weird western, but the better fitting 
description is sixguns and sorcery. Imagine a gunslinging Conan of 
Cimmeria wandering around a world more akin to America's Old West than 
pre-history, fighting eldritch abominations, corrupted mortals, 
monsters, and the struggle to help people.Now, a lot of fine 
folks helped me bring the first book to life but there were some things 
missing. Namely, an editor and a touch more artwork. That's where this 
campaign comes in. With your help, I can have a properly edited book, a 
cover, and promotional artwork. The former will make this book that much
 more of an enjoyable read, while the latter will help me in the long 
run. And while I'm very proud of A Demon in the Desert, this book is bigger and better. You could say book 1 was my mission statement.I'm sure you'd like to understand just how I'm planning on using 
these funds before you make your decision, since you as a backer are 
both a customer pre-ordering a product and an investor. Investors like 
knowing where their money's going. So here's how it works. The goal is 
$2000 broken down as follows:
$400 - Editing from Dominion Editorial
$600 - Artwork & Cover from Bob Kehl
$800 - Production costs. This entails things like the actual 
printing, shipping, and idiot padding, the usual aspects of any business
 venture. Self-publishing is no different.
8-10% of total funding for fees.
UPDATE: I'm maintaining the $2000 goal but I've spoken with Dominion about editing costs and they're willing to work with me on payment. On top of that, I originally wanted to get a full, 12x9 cover sleeve, but if I don't get the full amount this time, I'll just get a 6x9 cover and call that good. The 6x9 cover means I can't offer a proper wallpaper though, so please be aware of that. If you enjoyed the first book, welcome back. If you're 
new, I hope you'll join the crew. Grab your gear and come demon hunting.Expected release: October 1, 2016 - Just in time for Halloween and Orctober.Where to keep up with Ashe:Blog Facebook Twitter Tumblr Goodreads",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

I have long been concerned about the future of the environment due to issues like climate change, pollution, and waste. I saw what I felt like was a lot of deforestation as I grew up in the rapidly-growing area of Apex, North Carolina, and this sparked concern about how humans are impacting the environment on a much larger scale than just in my town. I also felt inspired by Rachel Carson’s impact on the environmental movement when she wrote about the ways humans were polluting in the mid-twentieth century.<br/><br/>Many other people are concerned about the future of life on this planet but may feel unsure how to support sustainable changes as individuals. I wanted to write a book to research and share ways that we can use communication today to help other people understand environmental challenges and support solutions.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how to effectively discuss the environment in a polarized and digital world, like:</p><ul>
<li><p>How UNC-Chapel Hill’s Clean Tech Summit brought people together from multiple industries and political parties</p></li>
<li><p>How you can use psychology strategies, like certain words and people’s personality types, to help your points resonate with your target audience</p></li>
<li><p>How social media, including posts by activists such as Greta Thunberg, can simultaneously help and hinder the environmental movement</p></li>
<li><p>How artists can inspire people in unique ways such as creating eco-friendly boats and composing music reflecting earth’s changing atmosphere</p></li>
</ul><p>My hope is that from reading this book, you will gain passion for talking about the environment and feel more equipped to talk to others about it, whether on a large platform or with individual conversations in your life.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you want to learn more about the environment, have been wanting to learn how to make a difference in spite of looming environmental problems, and if you like learning about types of communication like journalism and social media.<br/><br/><strong>Making a Difference</strong><br/><br/>I will donate 50% of the profits (once publishing is covered) to environmental charities that take action toward a sustainable future.</p><p><strong>The Book - <i>Planet Now</i></strong></p><p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 sets up the current landscape of the modern environmental movement. It discusses how tribalism led to polarization about the environment in the United States and how the internet and social media are allowing access to information about the environment to a broad audience.<br/><br/>Part 2 explores different strategies for effectively reaching audiences when trying to educate or persuade about the environment. It includes interviews with professionals such as Forbes journalist Jeff McMahon, HuffPost editor Kate Sheppard, and the Sierra Club Communications Director Maggie Kash.<br/><br/>Part 3 shares unique ways different individuals have shared environmental problems and solutions. For example, this section chronicles how UNC student Brooke Bauman created a podcast to share the impact of plastics on the environment, how UNC student Allie Omens brought the idea of the circular economy to campus through a conference, and how UNC professor Don Hornstein makes seemingly dry legal topics exciting in his environmental law class.</p><p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards paying for my editor to help me revise and publish my manuscript in July 2020 as well as the cover design (the mockups you see are a placeholder), layout design, copyediting, and launch and promotion efforts for my book.<br/><br/>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I can publish the paperback edition of <i>Planet Now </i>(in July 2020). <br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now, such as:</p><ul>

The ultimate FRAGMENTA book is now available for pre-order! Written for both newcomers and long-time FRAGMENTA fans alike, this book - <strong>“FRAGMENTA 2013 - 2018. Art and Life in Public Space” </strong> - is a treasure-trove of art, art in public space and insider-information about Malta. </p><p><strong>What is FRAGMENTA Malta? </strong></p><p>My name is Bettina Hutschek, I am an artist and curator based between Malta and Berlin. In 2013, I founded the NGO ‘FRAGMENTA Malta’<strong> (<a href=""http://www.fragmentamalta.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.fragmentamalta.com</a>) </strong>as a project space without physical space. FRAGMENTA is a platform to present contemporary art in the form of pop-up exhibitions in public spaces found across the Maltese archipelago. They can happen anywhere. The events are serious or funny, Dadaesque or exploratory, playful or thoughtful, or simply art; they respond or refer to issues present in society, and offer thinking space for the audience to raise their own questions.</p><p>Since 2013, FRAGMENTA has organised 25 events with 35 international artists. Between 2013 and 2015, the events were organised as no-budget events, based on mutual love for art and experimentation. Between 2016 and 2018, FRAGMENTA Malta was supported by the Valletta 2018 Foundation as part of the cultural programme of ‘Valletta 2018 - Capital of Culture’.</p><p>Since 2019, we have been yet again without additional funding. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562320104/fzirijxmujq5sbd7srsh.jpg"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562319898/t2devkqipob8snp698sy.jpg"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562320072/bxgzm5txizzciahi2a8c.jpg"" src=""""/>  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562320230/wdfnbnwhn7hukp81glqe.jpg"" src=""""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562320172/drzmgugk6ez83lpjdvrp.jpg"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562320194/a5grqwag8rx3dlrccxed.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Why a book? </strong></p><p>After over 5 successful years and 25 very diverse events, it was time for a publication! The book ‘FRAGMENTA 2013 - 2018. Art and Life in Public Space’ is the culmination of six years of reflection on public space, on art, on politics that govern public space, and on artistic attempts to raise awareness towards these issues. We came to design a book to keep some of the ephemeral moments going, to keep the critical thinking about public space going, and to treat art as a democratic tool of acting as citizens in a political field. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562129221/se3kjpeem5mtww54a8w2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p><p>In December 2018, we held a small book launch for the design of the same publication. It was printed only in a very limited print run (1 copy - yup), due to funding and other restrictions. Hence, we are now raising funds to cover printing costs for a large print run in order to reach a wider audience. </p><p><strong>Why are we using indiegogo?</strong></p><p>FRAGMENTA is using indiegogo in order to keep creative and editorial control over the content and aesthetics of the publication. In a time of increasing censorship through funding bodies, this seemed to be the way to go. </p><p><strong>THE PRINTED BOOK</strong></p><p>The book is a proud 256 pages thick, 12.5 x 17.6cm big and classic book block. It will come with a cover A3 print, which is folded and wrapped around the book. This cover can be used as independent poster and will show a map of Malta. </p><p>The publication contains descriptions, photographs and details of all 25 FRAGMENTA events that were held between 2013 and 2018, as well as newly commissioned texts by authors on art in public space (Fulya Erdemci, Sebastian Cichocki, Raphael Vella and Charlie Cauchi). It also showcases a humorous (but true!) list of headlines presenting events in public space which give a good image of what happened in Malta until 2018. The introduction text, written by Bettina Hutschek, gives a detailed overview over FRAGMENTA, its origins, reflections about art, politics and life in Malta and much more. </p><p>The book is designed by Jon Banthorpe (<a href=""http://artandmoney.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://artandmoney.org/</a>) </p><p>The goal of this campaign is to print a print run of 750 copies. The publication is in full color. </p><p>Basically with supporting this campaign you are financing the printing of the publication. </p><h2><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562319353/x2bpsxg2ttyylz6aba7s.jpg"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562319383/au2twgvpepgv3xgwwmyd.jpg"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562319407/bx6mmygibpyclq48cmkr.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></h2><h2><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562319505/d6iie5egewfij7fo3raa.jpg"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562319522/ugmeq6qu5a0ibq9fwxu9.jpg"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562319538/ljfxlwp99fect2tm0eoo.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></h2><p> </p><p><strong>SOMETHING IDEALISTIC</strong></p><p>Art has an obligation. It has a responsibility to perceive the world, or to attempt to alter perceptions and thinking patterns. I am not sure we are actually able to change things. The politics of the day seem to go backwards rather than forward. What is essential, however, is doing something. Something small. Something temporary. Something which might be conceived as trivial, random, surreal, comical, absurd, superfluous, but it is something set up to create a stream of love and laughter against a predominant feeling of fear and hatred. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562129455/pgorolhrji9hdq4ksn6j.jpg"" src=""""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562129478/spzenmfldgbr7qcjsj2j.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>TIMELINE</strong></p><p>The book will be printed in September/October 2019 at LONGO (<a href=""https://www.longo.media/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.longo.media/en/</a>) and will be shipped out starting October 2019.

The ultimate FRAGMENTA book is now available for pre-order! Written for both newcomers and long-time FRAGMENTA fans alike, this book - “FRAGMENTA 2013 - 2018. Art and Life in Public Space”  - is a treasure-trove of art, art in public space and insider-information about Malta. What is FRAGMENTA Malta? My name is Bettina Hutschek, I am an artist and curator based between Malta and Berlin. In 2013, I founded the NGO ‘FRAGMENTA Malta’ (www.fragmentamalta.com) as a project space without physical space. FRAGMENTA is a platform to present contemporary art in the form of pop-up exhibitions in public spaces found across the Maltese archipelago. They can happen anywhere. The events are serious or funny, Dadaesque or exploratory, playful or thoughtful, or simply art; they respond or refer to issues present in society, and offer thinking space for the audience to raise their own questions.Since 2013, FRAGMENTA has organised 25 events with 35 international artists. Between 2013 and 2015, the events were organised as no-budget events, based on mutual love for art and experimentation. Between 2016 and 2018, FRAGMENTA Malta was supported by the Valletta 2018 Foundation as part of the cultural programme of ‘Valletta 2018 - Capital of Culture’.Since 2019, we have been yet again without additional funding.         Why a book? After over 5 successful years and 25 very diverse events, it was time for a publication! The book ‘FRAGMENTA 2013 - 2018. Art and Life in Public Space’ is the culmination of six years of reflection on public space, on art, on politics that govern public space, and on artistic attempts to raise awareness towards these issues. We came to design a book to keep some of the ephemeral moments going, to keep the critical thinking about public space going, and to treat art as a democratic tool of acting as citizens in a political field. In December 2018, we held a small book launch for the design of the same publication. It was printed only in a very limited print run (1 copy - yup), due to funding and other restrictions. Hence, we are now raising funds to cover printing costs for a large print run in order to reach a wider audience. Why are we using indiegogo?FRAGMENTA is using indiegogo in order to keep creative and editorial control over the content and aesthetics of the publication. In a time of increasing censorship through funding bodies, this seemed to be the way to go. THE PRINTED BOOKThe book is a proud 256 pages thick, 12.5 x 17.6cm big and classic book block. It will come with a cover A3 print, which is folded and wrapped around the book. This cover can be used as independent poster and will show a map of Malta. The publication contains descriptions, photographs and details of all 25 FRAGMENTA events that were held between 2013 and 2018, as well as newly commissioned texts by authors on art in public space (Fulya Erdemci, Sebastian Cichocki, Raphael Vella and Charlie Cauchi). It also showcases a humorous (but true!) list of headlines presenting events in public space which give a good image of what happened in Malta until 2018. The introduction text, written by Bettina Hutschek, gives a detailed overview over FRAGMENTA, its origins, reflections about art, politics and life in Malta and much more. The book is designed by Jon Banthorpe (http://artandmoney.org/) The goal of this campaign is to print a print run of 750 copies. The publication is in full color. Basically with supporting this campaign you are financing the printing of the publication.      SOMETHING IDEALISTICArt has an obligation. It has a responsibility to perceive the world, or to attempt to alter perceptions and thinking patterns. I am not sure we are actually able to change things. The politics of the day seem to go backwards rather than forward. What is essential, however, is doing something. Something small. Something temporary. Something which might be conceived as trivial, random, surreal, comical, absurd, superfluous, but it is something set up to create a stream of love and laughter against a predominant feeling of fear and hatred.    TIMELINEThe book will be printed in September/October 2019 at LONGO (https://www.longo.media/en/) and will be shipped out starting October 2019. It will be presented at the Malta Book Fair in November 2019. Other Book Fairs are not confirmed yet. FRAGMENTA will also strive for international distribution - we are discussing with publishing and distribution houses. International distribution will start in November/ December 2019.  ONLINE and PRESSFRAGMENTA has been active on social media sites: FRAGMENTA Malta Facebook Page - https://www.facebook.com/fragmentamaltaevents/FRAGMENTA Malta Vimeo page - https://vimeo.com/fragmentamaltaFRAGMENTA Malta Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/fragmentamalta/And the official FRAGMENTA website: https://fragmentamalta.com/Our events have featured in articles and interviews in Maltese and international newspapers, blogs and TV shows such as Kultura News, MaltaToday. Times of Malta, Schlock Magazine or www.interartive.org.PERKSRewards are available for contributions starting at 2€. For 22€ you receive a printed copy of the book (the BOOK!) and for any perk above 22€ you will get the book and an additional perk. A lot of FRAGMENTA artists have very generously contributed from their archives. We offer original drawings from artists all over the world, as well as items which were used during FRAGMENTA events. You can read more about these rewards on the right side of this page.You will receive your rewards after the successful printing of the book, sometime between October and November 2019. MORE PERKS ARE BEING ADDED THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN!Production Costs - where the money will go. The money FRAGMENTA will raise will go directly into the printing of the publication FRAGMENTA 2013 - 2018. We have a quote over roughly 4900€ for 750 copies, excluding VAT. If we make a cautious calculation adding VAT, shipping of printed matter, and add indiegogo platform fees, production of perks, other overhead costs, and a tiny bit of contingency we arrive at an the amount we want to raise. The aim of this campaign is to print a run of 750 books. If we do not raise the whole amount we will print with the amount available, this book will happen for sure, even if it will be in a smaller run.    In the lucky case we WOULD have money leftover from printing etc (surprise us!) we would use these funds in order to advance distribution on an international level, which means that we have a better standing when discussing with distribution houses. If we do not manage to hit our funding goal, we will still use the money to print as many books as we can, and all of you who have contributed will get your perks. Any additional funds beyond that (please, surprise us even more!) would go into the account of the NGO FRAGMENTA Malta and would be used to organise future events in public spaces, be it in Malta or elsewhere in the world. We appreciate everyone's support in helping us realise this project. No amount is too small. If you cannot contribute financially, that doesn't mean you can't help us reach the goal. We would appreciate if you could forward this link to your friends, family and other contacts who you think might be interested in supporting me. We've poured our heart and soul into this project, and we are really excited to finally be able to get this out into the public sphere. It's been a long road, full of unique challenges, but we've managed to overcome each hurdle along the way. We hope you'll partner with us for this next phase, and support FRAGMENTA however you can.I want to thank all those who are willing to contribute. Please buy a book, get a kiss, and finance the print run, and also share this campaign on your social media platforms. Who is behind this? Bettina Hutschek (* 1977) is a Visual Artist, Curator and Videographer who lives and works between Berlin and Malta. She studied Fine Arts, Art History and Philosophy in Florence, Augsburg, Berlin, Barcelona and Leipzig and spent one year as Visiting Scholar at TISCH, NYU. In 2017, she co-curated together with Raphael Vella the Malta Pavilion at the Biennale di Venezia. Today, she uses fragments of different realities to examine the possibilities of knowledge transfer – that is: to tell stories. She is founder and director of FRAGMENTA Malta, a project to organize pop-up exhibitions in the public space of the Maltese Islands.Feel free to contact us : fragmentamalta@gmail.comFRAGMENTA Malta is a registered NGO in Malta: VO/1171FRAGMENTA ARTISTS 2013 - 2018 :

<p><strong>Campaign Overview</strong><br/>The book is intended to inspire and empower. I wrote it because I came to the realization that, while I lived under the same roof as one of the most influential people in my life, my mom, who was also the first “girlboss” I ever knew and saw in action, many others didn't have that relationship or figure to inspire and empower them like she did me. I hope that my book, which houses the stories of many women, will inspire those who need it. My book will publish in February 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p>The Female Collaborative is a book intended to inspire and empower females, young professionals, and anyone who aspires to be a change maker and leader. It houses the stories of women of the times who exemplify characteristics that you’d be likely to find within a BOSS.<br/><br/>My name is Fernanda Reutzel and I am the author of The Female Collaborative. I wrote it because I came to the realization that, while I lived under the same roof as one of the most influential people in my life, my mom, who was also the first strong female figure I ever knew and saw in action, many others didn't have that relationship or figure to inspire and empower them like she did me. I hope that my book, which houses the stories of many powerful, strong women, will inspire those who had a lack of that influence before and are seeking it now.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the inner female powerhouse that lies within us all. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for empowerment in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you become inspired.<br/><br/>In this book you’ll learn about the ways that different women have made and impact and surpassed their own hurdles, so that you can be empowered to do the same.<br/>· What it takes to be a female BOSS<br/>· Oprah? Joan Rivers?

</div></div>","Campaign OverviewThe book is intended to inspire and empower. I wrote it because I came to the realization that, while I lived under the same roof as one of the most influential people in my life, my mom, who was also the first “girlboss” I ever knew and saw in action, many others didn't have that relationship or figure to inspire and empower them like she did me. I hope that my book, which houses the stories of many women, will inspire those who need it. My book will publish in February 2020.
Story of My Book
The Female Collaborative is a book intended to inspire and empower females, young professionals, and anyone who aspires to be a change maker and leader. It houses the stories of women of the times who exemplify characteristics that you’d be likely to find within a BOSS.My name is Fernanda Reutzel and I am the author of The Female Collaborative. I wrote it because I came to the realization that, while I lived under the same roof as one of the most influential people in my life, my mom, who was also the first strong female figure I ever knew and saw in action, many others didn't have that relationship or figure to inspire and empower them like she did me. I hope that my book, which houses the stories of many powerful, strong women, will inspire those who had a lack of that influence before and are seeking it now.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the inner female powerhouse that lies within us all. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for empowerment in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you become inspired.In this book you’ll learn about the ways that different women have made and impact and surpassed their own hurdles, so that you can be empowered to do the same.· What it takes to be a female BOSS· Oprah?

Sin embargo, y pese a lo rutinario que al joven le parece su día a día, este dista mucho de ser algo corriente… pues los sueños que este tiene, enrevesados, aterradores y paranoicos, comenzarán a entrelazarse con su día a día, hasta el punto en que no sabrá distinguir vigilia y sueño.</p>

<h3>***NEW GOAL: $2,500***</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><i><a href=""http://hypocritereader.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hypocrite Reader</a></i> is an online leftist magazine founded in Brooklyn in 2011. We focus on useful, unexpected writing that changes the way we think and feel.</p>
<p>Our winter issue will go live on January 15th, 2021. We need money to pay our writers and promote their work.</p>
<h3>Our new issue: PROPHECIES</h3>
<p>The world is scary. Not just right now; it has been scary for a long time. Prophecies of doom and rapture have long filled us with dread. But ecstatic visions of a better world have also inspired revolts against social norms, heads of state, and institutions of oppression. Nor is divining the future the sole domain of cave-dwelling oracles and astrologers monitoring the circuits of heavenly bodies: from stock markets to election polling, from predicting the weather to modeling the effects of climate change, prophecies of a mundaner sort pervade the lives of even those unlikely to consult a tarot deck or a palm reader.</p>
<p>For our January issue, we seek to understand what kinds of futures those before us have envisioned––and allow our contributors to make some prophecies of their own. A friend of the magazine recently wrote to us that Hypocrite Reader should publish ""articles that make the world less scary and more comprehensible."" Our new issue will attempt to do just that. For more information, check out the <a href=""http://hypocritereader.com/contribute"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Contribute</a> page of our website.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is <i>Hypocrite Reader</i>?</h3>
<p>In 95 issues since 2011, we've run essays from the personal to the theoretical on politics, history, culture, and science, as well as poems, short stories, translations, comics, and artworks. Each issue of <i>Hypocrite Reader </i>has a theme. The winter 2021 theme will be PROPHECIES.</p>
<p>What we look for is contentious writing that's useful and unexpected. Such writing is rare and valuable. It often requires research and always demands careful thought.</p>
<p>Some of the pieces we've published, like Michael Cavadias's <a href=""http://hypocritereader.com/81/rent-regulation-nyc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""A Brief History of Rent Regulation in New York,""</a> Austin Gross's <a href=""http://www.hypocritereader.com/1/glossary-of-sexual-doubt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Glossary of Sexual Doubt""</a> (on Homosexuality-themed Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), and Jules Joanne Gleeson's <a href=""http://www.hypocritereader.com/94/eggs-queer-social-reproduction"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""An Aviary of Queer Social Reproduction,""</a> remain constantly visited reference works on their subjects years later and have even been translated. Writers we've worked with have gone on to achieve wider success: as just one example, a story we <a href=""http://hypocritereader.com/93/estranged-children-storybook-houses"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">recently published</a> was <a href=""https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-body-keeps-the-record-on-julian-k-jarboes-everyone-on-the-moon-is-essential-personnel/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">praised by the LARB</a> in a review of the author's first collection.</p>
<p>From 2011 to 2019, we achieved this with virtually no budget. Our signature highly intensive editing style focuses not just on polishing the minor details of a piece but on challenging and clarifying ideas and structure. This was our value proposition for writers: we can't pay you, but we can make your writing significantly better, and help you think more clearly and powerfully. But in 2020, we started paying. And now we never want to go back.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your help made SYMPTOMS possible</h3>
<p>For the first time in July 2020, thanks to your donations, we were able to pay our contributors. It honestly felt fantastic not to have to ask our contributors to work for free in a time of economic and social catastrophe. We were also able to put money toward promoting their work and helping them build the audience they deserve. And it's one of the best issues Hypocrite Reader has ever published.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">You can read the issue, SYMPTOMS, <a href=""http://hypocritereader.com/95/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>; it showcases work by two veteran Hypocrites, Olivia Durif and Ainsley Morse, and by eight contributors who published with us for the first time. You can also watch a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0_00bB2M98"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">panel discussion</a> in which three of the authors, Marybeth Ruether-Wu, Sandow Sinai, and Alexander Wells, discuss their thematically intertwined pieces alongside friend of the magazine Zoe Belinsky, moderated by editor Erica Eisen. Or you can listen to an <a href=""https://thisishell.com/interviews/1211-tamara-fernando"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">interview</a> on the podcast and radio show <i>This Is Hell </i>with author Tamara Fernando about her SYMPTOMS essay, ""Death at the Pearl Fishery.""</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>How will the money be used?</h3>
<p>After we fulfill the perks of this campaign that cost money to accomplish (shipping anthologies and shirts), we'll put a small fraction of the remaining funds towards promoting the articles, while the bulk of the money will be used to pay contributors.</p>
<p>The amount we pay per article depends both on the amount the campaign raises and the number of articles we publish. While we hope we will be able to pay much more, we'll commit to keeping the issue small enough that we can pay each contributor (writer or artist) at least $50. We believe $50 is the bare minimum that's still a useful amount of money for someone living cheaply.</p>
<p>Because of the success of our last Indiegogo campaign, we were able to pay over $100 to each contributor to SYMPTOMS. We hope to emulate that success with PROPHECIES.</p>
<p>If we make a truly ludicrous amount from this campaign (one can dream), we will roll some of that money over to help fund future issues and the further development of the magazine. </p>
</div><h3>Who are we?</h3><div>
<p>The editorial team has eight editors, none of whom are paid for editing: James Baxter, Kit Eginton, Erica Eisen, Nastya Panichkina, Lenna Pierce, Cat Pierro, Sandow Sinai, and Piper Wheeler.</p>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<div>
<p>Pass this along to friends and family!</p>

You can read the issue, SYMPTOMS, here; it showcases work by two veteran Hypocrites, Olivia Durif and Ainsley Morse, and by eight contributors who published with us for the first time. You can also watch a panel discussion in which three of the authors, Marybeth Ruether-Wu, Sandow Sinai, and Alexander Wells, discuss their thematically intertwined pieces alongside friend of the magazine Zoe Belinsky, moderated by editor Erica Eisen. Or you can listen to an interview on the podcast and radio show This Is Hell with author Tamara Fernando about her SYMPTOMS essay, ""Death at the Pearl Fishery.""

How will the money be used?
After we fulfill the perks of this campaign that cost money to accomplish (shipping anthologies and shirts), we'll put a small fraction of the remaining funds towards promoting the articles, while the bulk of the money will be used to pay contributors.
The amount we pay per article depends both on the amount the campaign raises and the number of articles we publish. While we hope we will be able to pay much more, we'll commit to keeping the issue small enough that we can pay each contributor (writer or artist) at least $50. We believe $50 is the bare minimum that's still a useful amount of money for someone living cheaply.
Because of the success of our last Indiegogo campaign, we were able to pay over $100 to each contributor to SYMPTOMS. We hope to emulate that success with PROPHECIES.
If we make a truly ludicrous amount from this campaign (one can dream), we will roll some of that money over to help fund future issues and the further development of the magazine. 
Who are we?
The editorial team has eight editors, none of whom are paid for editing: James Baxter, Kit Eginton, Erica Eisen, Nastya Panichkina, Lenna Pierce, Cat Pierro, Sandow Sinai, and Piper Wheeler.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Dylan Standing Alone, I am a member of the Blood Tribe in Alberta Canada. I am a Yoga Instructor and lifelong lover of art and the written word. I grew up loving libraries and newspapers, and lament their decline. I've also spent years enjoying the efforts of independent writers and artists, so attempting to reinvent the newspaper itself is a natural goal of mine. What I am doing is starting a decentralized, international newspaper that sources its content from independent content creators around the world.</p>
<p>The newspaper will be mailed out to most countries in the world on a month basis once we're up and running. We're planning on our first edition coming out in June of 2021. For now I'm running the organization as a charity funded by myself, I've made a bit of money from investing in cryptocurrencies, but I'd like the paper to eventually fund itself through donations, subscriptions, and ad revenue.</p>
<p>I'm dedicated to compensating artists for their work without seeking to own anyone's work or lock them into exclusivity deals. If you donate to this project you'll be supporting a true independent voice in a medium that is being forgotten in our tech hungry world. I look to create a reading experience that helps creators feel valued and that they're contributing to something lasting, with worldwide reach. We are the newspaper of the internet.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for around $10,000 dollars. Right now we need funds to ensure that we can properly compensate our artists, writers, and assistants, now and in the future. The expenses will most likely grow quickly with more subscribers and contributors. I'm in a fortunate position where I can devote my extra resources to fund the printing/distribution/etc.. I also want to offer Nobody's News for free to readers, to prove our value before we seek reward.</p>
<p>I'm confident I will be able to make this project self sufficient once we're off the ground. I have been doing public meetings under my personal YouTube channel ""Dylan Standing Alone"", this way anyone interested in the project is able to hear my thought process and some of the planning that has gone into the paper. If you donate to the newspaper, we'll be sure to credit you in the first issue, and you'll have priority in submitting work to be displayed in the newspaper itself!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, any funds will still help greatly in making sure this newspaper is a success! If you are not able to donate, sharing our campaign, or just telling people you know about it, will help tons. For more information or to receive a copy of the paper, email: info@nobodysnews.com</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Everything’s Not Peachy</i> follows a quick-witted 17 year old named Georgia Peach. Through the ups and downs of trying to navigate high school, Georgia identifies her own mental health struggles. She learns how to advocate for herself and her own mental well being.</p>
<p>---<br/><br/>My name is Margaret Pfohl and I am the author of <i>Everything’s Not Peachy</i>. I wrote this book because throughout high school I struggled with my own mental health, but I didn’t know how to identify what I was feeling or how to get help. <br/><br/>My hope is that by reading this book, you will discover how to identify and help yourself and others who may also be struggling. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn alongside Georgia as she realizes the importance of breaking stigmas surrounding mental health and advocating for herself.<br/><br/>Georgia Peach thinks she has everything figured out. She gets good grades, only applies to the best colleges and is ready to start her life outside of high school. She has good parents, even though she’s convinced that naming her Georgia Peach while living in the state of Georgia has to be a 17-year-long prank they’ve been pulling. Georgia likes her job at The Drip and she has Lily, her best friend since birth. Lily balances out Georgia’s realistic, sometimes pessimistic, outlook on life. She’s quirky, frilly and loud- all things that Georgia isn't. Lily is also the only one that Georgia confides in about the “incident.” As the pair navigate high school, drama is inevitable thanks to the school bully, Hannah Cascade, who ensures that rumors run rampant. As the ups and downs of high school drama and everyday life become too much, Georgia struggles to stay afloat. Through self-advocacy and confiding in those she trusts, she decides to takes her mental well-being into her own hands. Alongside Lily and her trusted counselor, everything seems to be coming together. That is until the rumors start flying...<br/><br/>You will love this book if you’re interested in a fresh take on mental health and want to learn more about how to advocate for yourself and those around you.<br/><br/><i>Everything’s Not Peachy</i> speaks to high school students and adults who want to see and understand mental health and healing in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Everything’s Not Peachy inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>

It’s easy to swallow, but it takes a while to digest.<br/><br/>My name is Emily Anne Smyth and I am the author of “On a Day Far From Death &amp; Other Poems.” I wrote this book because I walk through life collecting little images throughout my day. Whether it be a strange sight on the subway or a fragment of an overheard conversation, I eventually use these images in my creative work. These little “clicks” as I call them, little poems that I build up around an everyday moment I witness, have ultimately stacked up. I just have too many.Needless to say, I have created a book by stringing them together, creating a collage of little stories. Each poem is a microcosm of a real moment, captured and recorded to reveal the wonder and beauty of life. I wish to not only share my perspective of the world with you, but I also hope to encourage you to slow down and recognize the inherent value of the mundane.</p><p>This is a collection of poems that focuses on themes of youth, aging, death, wonder, and memory. Each poem is a snapshot of life: its own story or scene. It is up to the reader to interpret these snapshots, and to discover their hidden meanings. Each poem invites the reader to use their imagination to craft a connection to the poem in front of them.</p><p>You will love this book if you enjoy slowing down to admire the beauty around you. If you don’t have a lot of free time, this is the perfect book to pick up and put down on the go. You could even compare each poem as a daily vitamin; something to be taken alongside breakfast or just before you fall asleep. Each poem will give you a mini scene to mull over while you drive to work or as you try to fall asleep at the end of the day. Poem by poem, this collection will give you something to think about, rejoice about, or cry about. It will expand your horizons and allow you to look into the peephole of another person’s reality. <br/><br/>“On a Day Far From Death &amp; Other Poems” speaks to anyone who wants to grapple with mortality, hardships, or memory in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that “On a Day Far From Death &amp; Other Poems” inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>What does it mean to be human?</li>
<li>How do different generations need each other? How can we learn from one another?</li>
<li>How does one come to terms with their own mortality? </li>
<li>What does hope look like? </li>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>There is a group of American scholars and intellectuals whose history and legacy is often absent from K-12 textbooks and curriculum. Because of their brilliance, I like to think of them as elephants. As a student, not learning about their existence was the elephant in the classroom for me.</p>
<p><i>Black Elephant in the Classroom</i> is about the scholars, innovators, and entrepreneurs whose brilliance is often absent or on the peripheral of K-12 history textbooks.<br/><br/>My name is Jolie Radunich, and I am the author of <i>Black Elephant in the Classroom</i>. I wrote this book to share what I wish I knew sooner about a group of scholars, innovators, and entrepreneurs.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the many contributions this group has made, and the issues that arise when their narratives are ignored. In this book, I hope to ignite in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for these histories and stories. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you rethink the value of representation in K-12 curriculums.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the intellectual legacies of <i>elephants</i> and how modern thinkers are using technology and design to promote this history in classrooms. You'll hear stories such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The careers of individuals and collectives who centered their lives around ideas and learning</li>
<li>The influence of the education market on textbook content</li>
<li>Educational technologies promoting <i>elephants </i>inside and outside the classroom</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you want to challenge your assumptions of what you think you know about American history, are passionate about education reform, and want to feel empowered by the legacy of <i>elephant</i> scholarship in America.</p>
<p><br/><i>Black Elephant in the Classroom</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to curriculum reform advocates and history lovers who want to look at the impact history has on race relations in a new way.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Black Elephant in the Classroom</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1:</strong><i> </i>introduction + chapters [1-3]. Readers will be instantly exposed to the <i>elephants </i>in American history, like 19th century literary societies where ordinary Americans made reading, writing, discussion, and debate a part of their everyday lives.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2: </strong>chapters [4-6].<i> </i>Readers will uncover what the <i>elephant </i>is and explore how their distance from mainstream learning materials impact students and society. I will share my story dealing with curriculum violence during a classroom activity for the book Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong><i>: </i>chapters [7-10].<i> </i>There are so many thinkers designing curriculum, developing educational technology products, and building institutions to promote <i>elephants</i> today. One of the innovators readers will learn about is Movers and Shakers NYC who uses augmented reality to teach students about historical figures.<br/> </p>

There is a group of American scholars and intellectuals whose history and legacy is often absent from K-12 textbooks and curriculum. Because of their brilliance, I like to think of them as elephants. As a student, not learning about their existence was the elephant in the classroom for me.
Black Elephant in the Classroom is about the scholars, innovators, and entrepreneurs whose brilliance is often absent or on the peripheral of K-12 history textbooks.My name is Jolie Radunich, and I am the author of Black Elephant in the Classroom. I wrote this book to share what I wish I knew sooner about a group of scholars, innovators, and entrepreneurs.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the many contributions this group has made, and the issues that arise when their narratives are ignored. In this book, I hope to ignite in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for these histories and stories. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you rethink the value of representation in K-12 curriculums.In this book, you'll learn about the intellectual legacies of elephants and how modern thinkers are using technology and design to promote this history in classrooms. You'll hear stories such as:

The careers of individuals and collectives who centered their lives around ideas and learning
The influence of the education market on textbook content
Educational technologies promoting elephants inside and outside the classroom

 
You will love this book if you want to challenge your assumptions of what you think you know about American history, are passionate about education reform, and want to feel empowered by the legacy of elephant scholarship in America.
Black Elephant in the Classroom is a nonfiction book that speaks to curriculum reform advocates and history lovers who want to look at the impact history has on race relations in a new way.
 
The Book - Black Elephant in the Classroom
The book is written in 3 parts.Part 1: introduction + chapters [1-3]. Readers will be instantly exposed to the elephants in American history, like 19th century literary societies where ordinary Americans made reading, writing, discussion, and debate a part of their everyday lives.Part 2: chapters [4-6]. Readers will uncover what the elephant is and explore how their distance from mainstream learning materials impact students and society. I will share my story dealing with curriculum violence during a classroom activity for the book Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry.Part 3: chapters [7-10]. There are so many thinkers designing curriculum, developing educational technology products, and building institutions to promote elephants today. One of the innovators readers will learn about is Movers and Shakers NYC who uses augmented reality to teach students about historical figures.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><strong>K-Pop: The Odyssey</strong> is a fun, comprehensive look into K-Pop’s music, industry, and culture through the stories and insights from top experts and resources with a discussion of recent relevant themes. It will be balancing industry, academic, and fan perspectives to bring you a colorful array of viewpoints and topics.<br/><br/>My name is Wooseok Ki and I am the author of K-Pop: The Odyssey. I wrote this book because this is the most fascinating time to learn about <strong>K-Pop </strong>- it’s the biggest and most relevant it’s ever been on the global stage. K-Pop artists are making global headlines, social media platforms are filled with creative K-Pop content, fandoms are more diverse than ever before, and general public interest is growing exponentially. This isn’t an overnight sensation at all, but rather more of an <i><strong>odyssey</strong></i> - a long, eventful journey full of breakthroughs and setbacks. <br/><br/>Despite the myriad of K-Pop content today, there’s just simply not enough books out there! The existing books on K-Pop are either theory-driven, artist-specific, or outdated - so how and where should one look to get started and more knowledgeable about K-Pop as a whole phenomenon? As a fan myself, I wanted to create a comprehensive approach while opining on recent topics including Asian representation in Western media, fandoms’ collective social action, musical experimentation over the years, importance of online technology and community platforms, and more. As a Korean-American, I also hope to share my thoughts and experiences engaging with K-Pop in both South Korea and the US to provide a more balanced perspective on the global phenomenon.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll explore direct accounts and interesting discussions from a diverse panel of experts and resources that I've interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Executive Producer</strong> - How is potential rookie talent developed into a full-fledged R&amp;B artist like DEAN?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Songwriter </strong>- How are hit K-Pop songs behind top acts like BTS and EXO made?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Business Executive</strong> - How were top K-Pop acts like BIGBANG and CL marketed to a global audience?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Content Creator</strong> - What drives K-Pop fans’ passion, and what content and platforms are the future?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Trainee </strong>- What goes on during the life of a trainee en route to debuting as a K-Pop idol?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Recruiter </strong>- How are K-Pop trainees recruited and managed at a major entertainment company?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Journalist</strong> - How is K-Pop to be portrayed to a general audience that is unfamiliar?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Academia </strong>- How should we approach K-Pop under larger themes of Westernization, fandoms, and history?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Fan -</strong> What role does the fan play in relation to the K-Pop artist, the global phenomenon, and the fandom communities?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that K-Pop is much more than just <i>‘popular music from South Korea’. </i>In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for K-Pop in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a gateway - the amount of K-Pop content today is endless, and all you need to do is explore. My book will help you learn, recognize, and engage with the most important topics surrounding K-Pop before and as you dive into the movement.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you’re curious about what exactly K-Pop is and didn’t know where to properly look, or are an experienced fan seeking detailed insights into the phenomenon as well as brain-teaser topics relevant to larger societal themes. If you love reading about music, technology, business strategies, or social issues, there will be something for you to enjoy in this book. <strong>Even if you have absolutely no idea what K-Pop is and are on the fence about buying this book, I guarantee I will provide you with either knowledge or leisure (or both!) in a fun-to-read manner by the end. I promise!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - K-Pop: The Odyssey</h2>
<p>The book is written in 4 Parts:<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains an exploration into the never-ending question “What is K-Pop?” as well as bigger themes in Globalization and Online Technology. It’ll be setting the main framework on how K-Pop is perceived and defined as well as how K-Pop “got here”. It will discuss the evolution of K-Pop’s global trajectory including Asian success via the Hallyu Wave, US debut projects, Gangnam Style, to BTS today. You’ll be thinking critically about the importance of social media and interconnectedness, as well as technological developments amidst the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> includes a deeper dive into how K-Pop is produced and exported worldwide. It explores the successful K-Pop idol system in greater detail while positing challenges that Korean society faces as a whole. Further, through a series of expert interviews, it will explore how music and talent are produced and promoted around the world.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 </strong>focuses exclusively on K-Pop’s fandom culture. It will be invoking academic resources and recent collective sociopolitical action to provide a detailed overview on the diversity, unity, and ubiquity of K-Pop fandoms. It will illustrate the importance of fandoms to the overall K-Pop phenomenon, as well as address increasing misconceptions due to the fandoms’ prominence.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> will conclude the book with a discussion of where K-Pop goes from here, in terms of the remaining milestones and challenges to overcome including Asian representation and portrayals in Western media, recent industry strategies, and domestic developments in South Korea.</p>

<h3>What is Unwind?<br/><i>Que es Unwind?</i>

<p>Unwind: Vila de Gracia is a food guide/recipe book focused on Vila de Gràcia, a lovely neighbourhood in the city of Barcelona.</p>
<p>We've been exploring this neighbourhood's incredible food scene for many years and recommending the best places to our friends and family, until one day we realised that it would be a great idea to put together a specialized guide with our favourite bars, restaurants, bodegas, food shops and cafés so that we could share our knowledge with other people.<br/>-----------------------<br/><i>Unwind: Vila de Gracia es una guía de comida/libro de recetas enfocado en la Vila de Gràcia, un encantador barrio en la ciudad de Barcelona.</i></p>

<h3>
<br/>What are the advantages of our guide? <br/><i>¿Cuáles son las ventajas de nuestra guía?</i>
</h3>
<p>We are creating a specialized guide for people who are interested in having a very tasty and authentic experience in one of Barcelona's most interesting neighbourhoods without having to worry about spending a lot of money. We've been travelling a lot and have experienced problems when trying to find reasonably priced places to eat. Usually the quality is not good or the food is overpriced and in the end the restaurant experience is a disappointment. Also guides aren't always made by locals so usually many of the places recommended are actually just popular places as opposed to authentic local spots.</p>
<p>We feel that we have enough experience through our time living here and by running a food blog to put together a really complete guide for finding the best food in Vila de Gràcia.<br/>-----------------------<br/><i>Estamos creando una guía especializada para personas que estén interesadas en vivir una experiencia auténtica y deliciosa en uno de los barrios más interesantes de Barcelona sin tener que preocuparse por gastar mucho dinero.

<p>Guide books are usually about a city but rarely about a neighborhood and after you use a guide for a particular trip, you probably won't really need it anymore in the nearby future. Our idea is to release a guide that you can use before or after your trip as well. This is why we have decided to include recipes in our guide, we have asked some of our favourite restaurants in Vila de Gràcia to share some of their recipes so that anyone would be able to try them out at home. We will also include a couple of our own recipes in the guide.</p>
<p>So in case you’re not planning on visiting Barcelona anytime soon, maybe you can try cooking some of the recipes that will be featured on the guide, we think that it might convince you to come! We're really passionate about cooking so we want to offer something for food lovers around the world by sharing some genuine Barcelona flavours with everyone.<br/>-----------------------<br/><i>Por lo general, las guías son sobre una ciudad, pero rara vez sobre un barrio y después de utilizar una guía para un viaje en particular, es probable que no le encuentre utilidad en un futuro cercano.

Hemos pedido a algunos de nuestros restaurantes favoritos en Vila de Gràcia que compartan algunas de sus recetas para que cualquiera pueda probar hacerlas en casa. Incluiremos un par de nuestras propias recetas también.</i></p>

Unwind: Vila de Gracia is a food guide/recipe book focused on Vila de Gràcia, a lovely neighbourhood in the city of Barcelona.
We've been exploring this neighbourhood's incredible food scene for many years and recommending the best places to our friends and family, until one day we realised that it would be a great idea to put together a specialized guide with our favourite bars, restaurants, bodegas, food shops and cafés so that we could share our knowledge with other people.-----------------------Unwind: Vila de Gracia es una guía de comida/libro de recetas enfocado en la Vila de Gràcia, un encantador barrio en la ciudad de Barcelona.
Hemos estado explorando la increíble escena gastronómica de este barrio durante muchos años y recomendando los mejores lugares para visitar a nuestros amigos y familiares, hasta que un día nos dimos cuenta de que sería una buena idea armar una guía especializada con nuestros bares, bodegas, restaurantes, tiendas de alimentos y cafés favoritos para poder compartir nuestro conocimiento con otras personas.


What are the advantages of our guide? ¿Cuáles son las ventajas de nuestra guía?

We are creating a specialized guide for people who are interested in having a very tasty and authentic experience in one of Barcelona's most interesting neighbourhoods without having to worry about spending a lot of money. We've been travelling a lot and have experienced problems when trying to find reasonably priced places to eat. Usually the quality is not good or the food is overpriced and in the end the restaurant experience is a disappointment. Also guides aren't always made by locals so usually many of the places recommended are actually just popular places as opposed to authentic local spots.
We feel that we have enough experience through our time living here and by running a food blog to put together a really complete guide for finding the best food in Vila de Gràcia.-----------------------Estamos creando una guía especializada para personas que estén interesadas en vivir una experiencia auténtica y deliciosa en uno de los barrios más interesantes de Barcelona sin tener que preocuparse por gastar mucho dinero. Hemos viajado mucho y hemos experimentado problemas al tratar de encontrar lugares para comer a precios razonables. Por lo general, la calidad no es buena o la comida es demasiado cara y al final, la experiencia del restaurante es una decepción. Además, las guías no siempre son elaboradas por locales, por lo que muchos de los sitios recomendados son en realidad sitios populares en lugar de sitios auténticos. 
Sentimos que tenemos suficiente experiencia tomando en cuenta el tiempo que hemos vivido aquí y trabajando en nuestro blog de comida para armar una guía realmente completa para encontrar la mejor comida en Vila de Gràcia.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><strong>My name is Ron Cohen and I am the author of Working With Robots.</strong><br/><br/>Most conversations about the future of work focus on how AI will dramatically reshape modern industries. But very few answer the question what we should be doing now to prepare for an unpredictable future.<br/><br/>Working With Robots answers the big questions on everyone’s minds: How AI will redefine the way we Work and Learn? Will we eventually be able to relax while bots handle the most disagreeable chores? Or will AI systems take all the good jobs?<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the following:</p>
<p>Whether Robots will eventually replace us</p>
<p>What industries are most likely to be taken over by Robots</p>
<p>Will college degrees still be relevant in 15, 10, or even 5 years from now?</p>
<p>How Higher Ed institutions can meet the rapidly changing requirements of the industry</p>
<p>What are the most invaluable skills in the age of robots?</p>
<p>Working With Robots will help you understand how AI is redefining the workforce of the future. Regardless of where you are in your career—this book is relevant, a must-read, and timely.</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<p>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December, 2019</p>
<p>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</p>
<p>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</p>
<p>The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</p>
<p>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this Winter</p>
<p>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now. You will receive:</p>
<p>A personally signed copy of my book when I publish</p>
<p>A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</p>
<p>Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)</p>
<p>I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my book</p>
<p>And more...</p>

In his spare time, he loves to play with his beautiful daughter, watch soccer games around the world, and try weird combinations of food.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use.

<p>Greetings!
My name is Victoria Christian.  I am a
visionary artist, writer, and sociologist residing in
Ashland, Oregon.  My beautiful Mother,
Susan Stedman, is a wise grandmother and mother of three girls, a court
reporter, editor, and astrologer. To read a more detailed bio about us, click here: <a href=""http://mysticspiritart.com/about-the-contributors/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://mysticspiritart.com/about-the-contributors/</a></p><p>We would like to inform you of a
powerful co-creative book and DVD, that after ten years of hard work, is ready
to be in print.  While the DVD was released to the market in 2009 and has sold over 1,000 copies, we want to raise the money for 3,000 hard copies of our book <i>Feminine Mysticism
in Art: Artists Envisioning the Divine</i>.  <br/></p><p>It is important to note that this is not just an art book. It is
documenting some powerful voices and works of art in the Transcendental Art
Movement, the Women’s Spirituality Movement, and the Inter-Spirituality
Movement. If you are deeply concerned about the earth and HER inhabitants, social equality, the reemergence of the Divine Feminine on a global scale, and the transformative power of  sacred art to raise consciousness and heal the planet, then this an opportunity for you to support a radical humanitarian movement. </p><p></p>
<p>What
makes this book and DVD especially unique is the talented group of mystical
artists, writers and musicians who have synergistically combined their creative
visions in order to have a greater impact on humanity. While
there are indeed other illustrative books that reveal images of the Goddess,
this book is original because it includes the works of emerging and established
visionary artists that have yet to be published in book form.  Furthermore, the book includes a diversity of
mystical writings and sacred iconography from an assortment of spiritual
traditions so as to combat cultural and ideological barriers. </p><p>We have a powerful
coalition of over 65 established and emerging writers and artists on board.  Some of the writers include: Anne Baring,
Margaret Starbird, Vicki Noble, Arizika Razak, Jaquelyn Small, Penny Slinger,
Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee, Sandra Ingerman, Hank Wesselman, Jose Arguelles, Martin
Ball, Gary Stamper, Anya McAndrew, Lotus Linton (to name just a few). <br/></p>
<p>We
also have visionary artists such as Suzanne DeVeuve, AfraShe Asungi, Lili
Bernard, Yasmin Hernandez, Abba Yahudah, Daniel Mirante, Blaze Warrender, Krista Lyn Brown, Martina Hoffmann,
Robert Venosa, Hrana Janto, Amanda Sage, Mark Henson, Paul Heussenstamm, Andrew

And while some independent publishers are moving towards this model, most aren't.   However, several are open to negotiating distribution deals, which is what we most likely will do. </p><p>It has been recommended that we negotiate an arrangement with an independent publisher who already has a reputable distributor in place (only if we print 3,000 copies).

<p></p><p></p>
<p>In the late twentieth
century there is a growing awareness that we are threatened as a species and planet
unless we have a radical shift in consciousness.  Not only are we polluting the planet with toxic waste, our unsustainable materialistic lifestyle is contributing to ecological devastation and species depletion.</p><p>Gaia is definitely in distress and is crying out to us through earthquakes and tsunamis, floods and storms, heat and drought.</p><p>The re-emergence of the Goddess is becoming
the symbol and metaphor for our collective transformation into a New Earth or new paradigm.  For GAIA is a powerful Creatrix who generously offers her Earth based wisdoms, of which Indigenous cultures across the globe have always cherished.  In fact, most indigenous people would agree that postmodern civilizations need to reclaim this Gaian wisdom if we are to survive on the planet. </p><p><i></i></p>As the patriarchal elite and military warriors threaten to destroy the Earth and her beings, we are being called to awaken to the wisdom of the Sacred Feminine, for it is HER wisdom and compassion that will be the medicine for the new earth.<p></p><p><i>Feminine
Mysticism in Art: Artists Envisioning the Divine</i> is an attempt to fill the
void of Goddess imagery in the West by providing powerful images offered by
contemporary visionary artists and writers who have committed their life’s work
to the re-emergence of the feminine principle in Western society. </p><p>Some mystics, artists
and scholars have taken issue with traditional images of God, arguing that male
hegemony in Western cultures can be correlated directly to the centrality of a
single, all-powerful male God in the dominant strands of the predominantly
Jewish and Christian religious heritage of Europe and the United States. Many
would argue further that, given this situation, it is important for women, as
well as for men with feminist goals, to recover or create empowering female
symbols to help balance the ones that support patriarchy, the denial of the
feminine principle, the demise of nature, and a one-sided view of humanity. </p><p>Our ultimate goal is
to cultivate an awareness of the primordial sacred union--to completely
transcend gender associations and embrace the eternal One. Yet imaging the
Divine as female is essential to our spiritual evolution, for we won't be able
to transcend gender associations in Western culture until the autonomy of the
feminine principle is fully established in human consciousness.  </p><p>Artists who are reclaiming the sacred
iconography of the Goddess are creating a new perception of reality that is representative
of their experience as spiritual women and men. 
They are also healing the imbalance between the masculine and feminine
principles that tears at our social fabric.</p><p>The purpose of the book is to not
only document a genre of art referred to as Feminine mysticism, but also to
reveal powerful images of the Divine in his/her myriad forms. Feminine Mysticism is a spiritual
movement devoted to the re-enchantment of the feminine face of God, which has
been lost to many Westerners, but is beginning to surface in various ways.</p>
<p>In the past 30 years, scholars from
various disciplines have documented the ancient cultures and religions of the
Goddess and the ways in which they have been subjugated by the patriarchal
religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. </p>
<p>A number of scholars have
ascertained that God was conceived of as female for at least the first 200,000
years of human life on Earth, a far longer reign than that of the patriarchy. Therefore, it is important to evoke
a reawakening of the Goddess through art and symbolism as these media can
trigger on an unconscious level a universal, archetypal remembrance of the
Goddess.</p>
<p>Since we are on the verge of a major
break through in the evolution of human consciousness, it is important to get
as many images before the public as possible, for art is HER most powerful form
of communication and has the potential to spark a tidal wave of awakening. </p>
<p>Artists Envisioning the Divine holds
up a sword of TRUTH—it is radical in its humanitarian message as it cuts
through the illusions of the matrix. It is also radical in its message of love
and compassion, which are so needed in the world today. <br/></p><p></p><p>This book is imbued with a timeless wisdom that has the potential to nourish the soul in this global dark night of the soul.  It is timely in the sense that it has the potential to be a catalysts of awakening on a global scale.  And believe it or not, artists and mystics are the prophets of our day, despite the fact that they have been marginalized for centuries.  This is a powerful movement that will continue to build momentum in years to come.</p><p>We have definitely co-created an amazing project.  We have been fortunate to receive endorsements from some of the most enlightened luminaries of our day, such as Andrew Harvey, Anne Baring, Sandra Ingerman, Llewellyn Vaughn-Lee, Hank Wesselman, Margaret Starbird, Gloria Orenstein, Debra Giusti and several more. click here to read some of these endorsements:</p><a href=""http://mysticspiritart.com/endorcements/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://mysticspiritart.com/endorcements/</a><p><br/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/></p> <p>In any decision one makes, there will always be risks and challenges.  We have definitely faced our challenges in creating a book of such magnitude.  And while the hardest mountains have been climbed, we still face a hurdle of raising the money for the first print. Of course, the fragile economy that we are in today is a concern for any business venture. But this is all a part of the Great Turning, of which <i>Feminine Mysticism in Art</i> reveals. </p><p>What is particularly promising is the growing population of cultural creatives who would love to have a copy of this book. These creative millions are at the leading edge of
several kinds of cultural changes deeply affecting not only their own lives but
our larger society as well. They are called <i>cultural
creatives</i> because, innovation by innovation, they are shaping a new kind of
American culture for the Twenty-First Century. </p><p>The “core” group of cultural
creatives is the leading edge of the subculture, consisting of 24 million
people. These are the people who will most likely be interested in <i>Artists Envisioning the Divine</i>. They
consist of published writers, artists, musicians, psychotherapists,
environmentalists, feminists, alternative health care providers and other
professionals. They have strong values of personal growth, spirituality, and
concerns for the ecology and well being of the planet. Interestingly, twice as
many women as men are in this group (Ray and Anderson, 2000, Three Rivers
Press).  </p><p>Furthermore, the book will
appeal to a certain segment of the male population, particularly professionals
in the healing arts industry and those affiliated with alternative religious
movements.  While the majority of
conservatives and fundamentalist Christians are most likely not our market
niche, there are several religious groups who may find this book interesting,
particularly Gnostics, those affiliated with Eastern religions and New Age
spirituality (including Native American shamanism).</p>
<p>With extensive experience in marketing to the New
Age market as well as strong networking, communication and organizational
skills, I am confident in my ability to market this book through an assortment
of promotional media.  Both Susan and I
would be happy to do a book tour, attend trade shows as well as do radio and
television interviews.  I have created a
beautiful website for the book, which can be viewed at: <a href=""http://www.mysticspiritart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mysticspiritart.com</a>. Furthermore,
all of the contributors have agreed to promote the book on their websites,
trade shows, fine art shows and conferences they attend throughout the year.
Some of the contributors are interested in doing spin-off projects for the
book, such as organizing a traveling
show that will tour museums and universities. </p>
<p>With
the diversity of expertise and talent involved in this book, we are confident
it will reach our intended market niche both nationally and
internationally.  We are hoping to make
most of our profit selling directly to our market niche through non-bookstore
retailers (museums, artist supply stores, galleries, specialty gift shops,
alternative bookstores, libraries, spiritual retreat centers).</p><p> We will also be
attending a select number of spiritual conferences, art shows and trade shows
such as the New Age retailer. Another marketing channel that directly targets
our market niche is catalogs for the healing arts industry.  We will also be pursuing internet marketing
as well, such as getting the book listed on spiritual websites and major
catalogs that sell to the same market niche. </p>
<p>We
are in the midst of planning a publicity campaign. Getting the book reviewed
will be a vital part of our marketing strategy because major buyers rely on
book reviews as a source of quality control. We will send free copies to select people for
reviews and endorsements. I have a long list of magazines that
have offered to do reviews, publish articles, and promote the book on their
websites. </p><p>We will also be placing ads in various media outlets that target our
market, not to mention investing in a lot of marketing and promotional
materials, such as posters, flyers, press kits, galleys and websites. The DVD
along with other promotional materials will help sell the book. I will also be
doing slide show presentations and lectures at spiritual conferences, museums
and universities all over the United States, which will be a huge source of
promotion, as well as a lucrative channel to make book sales. </p>

However, you will need to contact Victoria regarding the specific details and images available (electrart@hotmail.com). The Social Impact The Book Will Have on the World: 

In the late twentieth
century there is a growing awareness that we are threatened as a species and planet
unless we have a radical shift in consciousness.  Not only are we polluting the planet with toxic waste, our unsustainable materialistic lifestyle is contributing to ecological devastation and species depletion.Gaia is definitely in distress and is crying out to us through earthquakes and tsunamis, floods and storms, heat and drought.The re-emergence of the Goddess is becoming
the symbol and metaphor for our collective transformation into a New Earth or new paradigm.  For GAIA is a powerful Creatrix who generously offers her Earth based wisdoms, of which Indigenous cultures across the globe have always cherished.  In fact, most indigenous people would agree that postmodern civilizations need to reclaim this Gaian wisdom if we are to survive on the planet. As the patriarchal elite and military warriors threaten to destroy the Earth and her beings, we are being called to awaken to the wisdom of the Sacred Feminine, for it is HER wisdom and compassion that will be the medicine for the new earth.Feminine
Mysticism in Art: Artists Envisioning the Divine is an attempt to fill the
void of Goddess imagery in the West by providing powerful images offered by
contemporary visionary artists and writers who have committed their life’s work
to the re-emergence of the feminine principle in Western society. Some mystics, artists
and scholars have taken issue with traditional images of God, arguing that male
hegemony in Western cultures can be correlated directly to the centrality of a
single, all-powerful male God in the dominant strands of the predominantly
Jewish and Christian religious heritage of Europe and the United States. Many
would argue further that, given this situation, it is important for women, as
well as for men with feminist goals, to recover or create empowering female
symbols to help balance the ones that support patriarchy, the denial of the
feminine principle, the demise of nature, and a one-sided view of humanity. Our ultimate goal is
to cultivate an awareness of the primordial sacred union--to completely
transcend gender associations and embrace the eternal One. Yet imaging the
Divine as female is essential to our spiritual evolution, for we won't be able
to transcend gender associations in Western culture until the autonomy of the
feminine principle is fully established in human consciousness.  Artists who are reclaiming the sacred
iconography of the Goddess are creating a new perception of reality that is representative
of their experience as spiritual women and men. 
They are also healing the imbalance between the masculine and feminine
principles that tears at our social fabric.The purpose of the book is to not
only document a genre of art referred to as Feminine mysticism, but also to
reveal powerful images of the Divine in his/her myriad forms. Feminine Mysticism is a spiritual
movement devoted to the re-enchantment of the feminine face of God, which has
been lost to many Westerners, but is beginning to surface in various ways.
In the past 30 years, scholars from
various disciplines have documented the ancient cultures and religions of the
Goddess and the ways in which they have been subjugated by the patriarchal
religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. 
A number of scholars have
ascertained that God was conceived of as female for at least the first 200,000
years of human life on Earth, a far longer reign than that of the patriarchy. Therefore, it is important to evoke
a reawakening of the Goddess through art and symbolism as these media can
trigger on an unconscious level a universal, archetypal remembrance of the
Goddess.
Since we are on the verge of a major
break through in the evolution of human consciousness, it is important to get
as many images before the public as possible, for art is HER most powerful form
of communication and has the potential to spark a tidal wave of awakening. 
Artists Envisioning the Divine holds
up a sword of TRUTH—it is radical in its humanitarian message as it cuts
through the illusions of the matrix. It is also radical in its message of love
and compassion, which are so needed in the world today. This book is imbued with a timeless wisdom that has the potential to nourish the soul in this global dark night of the soul.  It is timely in the sense that it has the potential to be a catalysts of awakening on a global scale.  And believe it or not, artists and mystics are the prophets of our day, despite the fact that they have been marginalized for centuries.  This is a powerful movement that will continue to build momentum in years to come.We have definitely co-created an amazing project.  We have been fortunate to receive endorsements from some of the most enlightened luminaries of our day, such as Andrew Harvey, Anne Baring, Sandra Ingerman, Llewellyn Vaughn-Lee, Hank Wesselman, Margaret Starbird, Gloria Orenstein, Debra Giusti and several more. click here to read some of these endorsements:http://mysticspiritart.com/endorcements/Risks & Challenges In any decision one makes, there will always be risks and challenges.  We have definitely faced our challenges in creating a book of such magnitude.  And while the hardest mountains have been climbed, we still face a hurdle of raising the money for the first print. Of course, the fragile economy that we are in today is a concern for any business venture. But this is all a part of the Great Turning, of which Feminine Mysticism in Art reveals. What is particularly promising is the growing population of cultural creatives who would love to have a copy of this book. These creative millions are at the leading edge of
several kinds of cultural changes deeply affecting not only their own lives but
our larger society as well. They are called cultural
creatives because, innovation by innovation, they are shaping a new kind of
American culture for the Twenty-First Century. The “core” group of cultural
creatives is the leading edge of the subculture, consisting of 24 million
people. These are the people who will most likely be interested in Artists Envisioning the Divine. They
consist of published writers, artists, musicians, psychotherapists,
environmentalists, feminists, alternative health care providers and other
professionals. They have strong values of personal growth, spirituality, and
concerns for the ecology and well being of the planet. Interestingly, twice as
many women as men are in this group (Ray and Anderson, 2000, Three Rivers
Press).  Furthermore, the book will
appeal to a certain segment of the male population, particularly professionals
in the healing arts industry and those affiliated with alternative religious
movements.  While the majority of
conservatives and fundamentalist Christians are most likely not our market
niche, there are several religious groups who may find this book interesting,
particularly Gnostics, those affiliated with Eastern religions and New Age
spirituality (including Native American shamanism).
With extensive experience in marketing to the New
Age market as well as strong networking, communication and organizational
skills, I am confident in my ability to market this book through an assortment
of promotional media.  Both Susan and I
would be happy to do a book tour, attend trade shows as well as do radio and
television interviews.  I have created a
beautiful website for the book, which can be viewed at: www.mysticspiritart.com. Furthermore,
all of the contributors have agreed to promote the book on their websites,
trade shows, fine art shows and conferences they attend throughout the year.
Some of the contributors are interested in doing spin-off projects for the
book, such as organizing a traveling
show that will tour museums and universities. 
With
the diversity of expertise and talent involved in this book, we are confident
it will reach our intended market niche both nationally and
internationally.  We are hoping to make
most of our profit selling directly to our market niche through non-bookstore
retailers (museums, artist supply stores, galleries, specialty gift shops,
alternative bookstores, libraries, spiritual retreat centers). We will also be
attending a select number of spiritual conferences, art shows and trade shows
such as the New Age retailer. Another marketing channel that directly targets
our market niche is catalogs for the healing arts industry.  We will also be pursuing internet marketing
as well, such as getting the book listed on spiritual websites and major
catalogs that sell to the same market niche. 
We
are in the midst of planning a publicity campaign. Getting the book reviewed
will be a vital part of our marketing strategy because major buyers rely on
book reviews as a source of quality control. We will send free copies to select people for
reviews and endorsements. I have a long list of magazines that
have offered to do reviews, publish articles, and promote the book on their
websites. We will also be placing ads in various media outlets that target our
market, not to mention investing in a lot of marketing and promotional
materials, such as posters, flyers, press kits, galleys and websites. The DVD
along with other promotional materials will help sell the book. I will also be
doing slide show presentations and lectures at spiritual conferences, museums
and universities all over the United States, which will be a huge source of
promotion, as well as a lucrative channel to make book sales. 
Other Ways You Can Help: We realize that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean that you can't help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. We would greatly appreciate any promotional efforts you can make, such as using the Indiegogo share tools and forwarding this to some of your contacts and posting it on your face book page. We thank you for your valued time.  It was time well spent. Many blessings on your personal and collective awakening!!!Victoria Christian and Susan Stedman",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

that aren't as friendly as they appear. Monsters like giant parasitic bugs and ancient sea beasts on the prowl. A mysterious plague turning the homeless

with a monster of Celtic myth. and

<p>Kära vänner, bekanta och obekanta! Här är den. Alla mina små konstprojekt genom åren har lett till den här boken. Boken som kom till en solig, färgsprakande vacker höstdag i september förra året. Då jag såg min dotters äkta glädje över denna färgexplosion till årstid. Hennes beundran över löven, som var lika vackra att titta på som roliga att leka med. Jag fick en sån extrem inspirationskick den dagen och satte igång att skriva ett manus och illustrera bilder till vad som skulle bli 'Pixie och pappa - På höstpromenad'. </p>
<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499348352/wion2qek3tzt0ntu1pwd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>En bok som lyfter fram pappa- och barnrelationen på ett mysigt och positivt sätt. Tanken är att med hjälp av boken, uppmuntra och inspirera pappor och påminna dom om den viktiga roll dom har i sina barns liv. <br/><br/>Samtidigt vill boken uppmuntra till att lämna hemmet och upptäcka naturen med sina barn oavsett väder. Det är något märkligt som sker i relationen mellan förälder och barn när man umgås ute bland vackra blommor, färgsprakande höstlöv eller barfota i gräset en varm sommardag. När man stannar upp studerar och njuter av naturen, mår man otroligt bra.</p>
<p>'Pixie och pappa - På höstpromenad' består av 26 detaljrika och färgglada sidor inklusive bokens omslag. Måtten kommer att vara 16,5 x 12,5 cm. </p>
<p>Boken är skriven och illustrerad utifrån Pixies perspektiv men där också pappa får stå i fokus. Den här boken är en hyllning till alla pappor där ute! Ni är grymma och otroligt viktiga. </p>
<p>Min känsla är att det här är en bok som är rätt i tiden och kan påverka många pappor positivt. </p>
</div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499348374/otpj5e1pddxegnosj5em.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>Tusen tack till alla er som hjälpte till att förverkliga den första upplagan. 121% fick vi ihop och pengarna går till att trycka upp 1000st exemplar av boken såväl som en del marknadsföring. </p>

</div></div>","Kära vänner, bekanta och obekanta! Här är den. Alla mina små konstprojekt genom åren har lett till den här boken. Boken som kom till en solig, färgsprakande vacker höstdag i september förra året. Då jag såg min dotters äkta glädje över denna färgexplosion till årstid. Hennes beundran över löven, som var lika vackra att titta på som roliga att leka med. Jag fick en sån extrem inspirationskick den dagen och satte igång att skriva ett manus och illustrera bilder till vad som skulle bli 'Pixie och pappa - På höstpromenad'. 


En bok som lyfter fram pappa- och barnrelationen på ett mysigt och positivt sätt. Tanken är att med hjälp av boken, uppmuntra och inspirera pappor och påminna dom om den viktiga roll dom har i sina barns liv. Samtidigt vill boken uppmuntra till att lämna hemmet och upptäcka naturen med sina barn oavsett väder. Det är något märkligt som sker i relationen mellan förälder och barn när man umgås ute bland vackra blommor, färgsprakande höstlöv eller barfota i gräset en varm sommardag. När man stannar upp studerar och njuter av naturen, mår man otroligt bra.
'Pixie och pappa - På höstpromenad' består av 26 detaljrika och färgglada sidor inklusive bokens omslag. Måtten kommer att vara 16,5 x 12,5 cm. 
Boken är skriven och illustrerad utifrån Pixies perspektiv men där också pappa får stå i fokus. Den här boken är en hyllning till alla pappor där ute! Ni är grymma och otroligt viktiga. 
Min känsla är att det här är en bok som är rätt i tiden och kan påverka många pappor positivt. 


Tusen tack till alla er som hjälpte till att förverkliga den första upplagan. 121% fick vi ihop och pengarna går till att trycka upp 1000st exemplar av boken såväl som en del marknadsföring. 
Den här sidan har nu gått över till en InDemand-sida. Målet är alltså uppnått och nu kan man istället beställa boken direkt här på sidan! 


Vare sig du kan köpa boken eller inte, kan du hjälpa till att sprida boken på ytterligare andra sätt.  Använd gärna ""dela-knapparna"" som finns uppe till höger här på InDemand-sidan.

Dela gärna hemsidan, www.pixieochpappa.se med folk. När boken är tryckt och finns att få tag på, kan ni rekommendera boken till bekanta, skriva en recension eller be ditt lokala biblioteket ta in boken. Känner ni någon som arbetar inom någon form av media, be dom kika in boken!

Som boktiteln antyder, är tanken att det kommer en bok för varje årstid. Konceptet är egentligen färdigt vid det här laget och jag har påbörjat arbetet med nästa bok. Det vore roligt att göra en interaktiv Pixie och pappa-bok i form av en app. En finsk översättning finns redan och jag ser över möjligheten att översätta manuset till engelska också. Om den svenska versionen går bra, skulle det vara trevligt att trycka upp boken på fler språk.

<p>Justo hace un año Susan y yo decidimos emprender este viaje por Latinoamérica. <strong>El proyecto Expedición en moto; Motografiando América Latina </strong>se trata de un viaje en dos motocicletas Honda NX4 Falcon 400 cc, las Falcon Rockeras, que nos permiten recorrer cómodamente todos los terrenos para fotografiar los hermosos paisajes y personas que componen Sudamérica. </p>
<p>Hemos dividido el viaje en etapas, cada etapa será un capítulo en los dos libros que estamos escribiendo, uno con el relato de la aventura y el otro con las fotos de la travesía. </p>
<p>Un mes antes del viaje <strong>nos robaron la cámara principal</strong> que usaríamos para esto, una <strong>Canon EOS 60D</strong>, nos quedamos sólo con una Canon compacta. Por lo que tuvimos que invertir parte de nuestros ahorros del viaje en comprar otra vez la cámara.</p>
<p>En la segunda etapa del viaje, en Puerto Natales (cercano a Torres del Paine) nos robaron todo el equipaje a ambos. La pérdida fue lamentable, más aun porque nuevamente usamos parte de nuestros ahorros para volver a equiparnos y continuar con nuestra aventura.  </p>
<p>A la fecha hemos completado Tres etapas del viaje. </p>
<p><strong>Etapa I: En Busca del Océano más allá de las montañas</strong>: Nos llevó desde Santiago de Chile a cruzar toda la Argentina por la Ruta 7 hasta Buenos Aires, cruzamos a Uruguay para recorrer Montevideo y <strong>Punta del Este</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Etapa II: Explorando el Fin del Mundo.</strong> La más larga hasta ahora (4 meses). Salimos desde Santiago hacia el sur de Chile, recorrimos toda la <strong>Carretera Austral, la Ruta 40</strong> de Argentina pasando por <strong>Calafate y Chalten</strong>. Volvimos a Chile para ir al <strong>PN Torres del Paine</strong> y Punta Arenas, cruzamos a la isla <strong>Tierra del Fuego</strong> para llegar al final de las rutas en <strong>Ushuaia </strong>en Argentina y el <strong>Parque Karukinka</strong> en Chile.</p>
<p><strong>Etapa III: Descubriendo el Valle Sagrado</strong>. Recorrimos todo el norte de Chile, incluyendo <strong>San Pedro de Atacama</strong> y el inicio de Chile en el <strong>Hito Tripartito Visviri</strong>. Fuimos al <strong>Salar de Uyuni</strong> en Bolivia y luego a Perú para visitar el <strong>Cañón de Colca</strong>, Cusco, el <strong>Valle Sagrado y Machu Picchu</strong>. </p>
<p>Ahora estamos reuniendo fondos para continuar con el viaje y la <strong>Etapa IV: Cruzando Hemisferios</strong>, ruta que nos llevará al norte de Perú, Ecuador y Colombia. Terminar esta nueva etapa nos ayudará a tener un registro fotográfico más completo de nuestro viaje para al final publicar los libros.</p>
<p>En la ruta Susan está dando clases de fotografía y yo comparto mis conocimientos como Meastro del programa internacional No Deje Rastro (Leave No Trace impulsado por la NOLS) en universidades e institutos, completamente gratis. De esta forma nos acercamos más a la gente local y compartimos nuestros conocimientos y pasiones con ellos. </p>
<p>Este es nuestro proyecto, nuestro sueño, el viaje de nuestras vidas que culmina no sólo con bellos recuerdos, sino en dos libros, un registro tangible que perdure en el tiempo y podamos compartir con más personas, tanto con los que no pueden viajar, como con aquellos que sólo necesitan una pequeña motivación para salir y descubrir el mundo, porque es realmente alucinante.  </p>
<p>Nos pueden ayudar donando a través de esta instancia, o simplemente compartiendo nuestro viaje y experiencia con sus amigos. </p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Huellas del pasado</strong> es una novela de género negro, porque a su autora siempre le ha gustado y, como estudia Medicina, es uno de los campos en los que tiene un conocimiento más amplio.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Una joven agente del FBI, Lulú Jackson, trabajaba como infiltrada de periodista en el New York Times investigando un caso por contrabando de drogas en el que estaba involucrada una famosa actriz. Un día aparece una víctima de asesinato y es solicitada por su jefe para iniciar la investigación de lo que ¿podría ser un asesino en serie? Varios crímenes sucedieron mientras la vida de la joven detective se centraba en su trabajo, acompañada por su nuevo compañero Speckler.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Cansada de tanto trabajo e invitada por una de sus amigas para celebrar su compromiso matrimonial, decidieron salir de fiesta y coger un tren cuyo destino era New Jersey; pero aquel viaje en ese tren rebosante de alegría y juventud no sería como habían previsto, porque ese tren estaba cargado de acontecimientos traumáticos e inesperados que no entraban en sus planes de fiesta y le harían sustituir su traje de gala por su uniforme de agente.</p>

Actualmente, estoy cursando sexto de Grado de Medicina en la Facultad de Medicina y Enfermería de Córdoba.</p>

<h3>Sales Success Stories - The Book</h3>
<p>46 episodes ago I started capturing the real world success stories of world class sales performers who are either #1 or in the top 1% of their respective organizations.</p>
<p>My name is Scott Ingram and I'm the host of the <a href=""https://top1.fm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sales Success Stories Podcast</a>. This is my passion project as I'm also a quota carrying sales professional myself, and am always looking for ways to improve myself and my own sales results.</p>
<p>Following the first ever Sales Success Summit a few of us got together to discuss a collaborative book project and this campaign is here to help fund that initiative. As we looked at the sales book landscape we realized that nearly all of the books related to sales and selling were written by some ""sales guru"" telling you want you should do to sell more.</p>
<p>What's missing is real stories from real sellers who are at the top of their game NOW talking about what's working for them. In this book you won't be preached at. Instead you'll just get to read or listen to raw, emotional stories from the best of the best about real deals and real experiences and what they've learned.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are a myriad of details involved in publishing a book and audio book. Your support will help pay for the design, editing, proofreading, layout, printing and distribution of the book and the recording, editing, and distribution of the audiobook.</p>
<p>You can choose to receive any combination of the ebook, book, audiobook in addition to options for sneak previews of the content, opportunities to connect directly with some of the co-authors and even the videos from the Sales Success Summit.</p>
<p>Need something special? Maybe a package of 37 books? Just reach out and I'll be happy to setup a custom perk for you.</p>
<p><strong>ALL Contributors of $50 and above will get their name in the book AND access to a Google Doc where you can read all of the currently submitted stories right now!</strong></p>
</div><div>

46 episodes ago I started capturing the real world success stories of world class sales performers who are either #1 or in the top 1% of their respective organizations.
My name is Scott Ingram and I'm the host of the Sales Success Stories Podcast. This is my passion project as I'm also a quota carrying sales professional myself, and am always looking for ways to improve myself and my own sales results.
Following the first ever Sales Success Summit a few of us got together to discuss a collaborative book project and this campaign is here to help fund that initiative. As we looked at the sales book landscape we realized that nearly all of the books related to sales and selling were written by some ""sales guru"" telling you want you should do to sell more.
What's missing is real stories from real sellers who are at the top of their game NOW talking about what's working for them. In this book you won't be preached at. Instead you'll just get to read or listen to raw, emotional stories from the best of the best about real deals and real experiences and what they've learned.

What We Need & What You Get
There are a myriad of details involved in publishing a book and audio book. Your support will help pay for the design, editing, proofreading, layout, printing and distribution of the book and the recording, editing, and distribution of the audiobook.
You can choose to receive any combination of the ebook, book, audiobook in addition to options for sneak previews of the content, opportunities to connect directly with some of the co-authors and even the videos from the Sales Success Summit.
Need something special? Maybe a package of 37 books? Just reach out and I'll be happy to setup a custom perk for you.
ALL Contributors of $50 and above will get their name in the book AND access to a Google Doc where you can read all of the currently submitted stories right now!

<p>This novel carries weight that I don't believe other works do because it is intended to help victims of abuse know they are not alone, familiarize individuals who don't know anything about relational abuse with the pain and inescapability that it causes, and show individuals suffering with mental illness that happy endings are hard, but possible.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Kat &amp; Stella</i> tells the story of Stella, a famous singer, and Kat, the woman hired to help Stella develop a more charitable public image. Kat must convince Stella to release the personal music she’s too afraid to share with the world, all while the two deal with heartbreak, family, and life in their twenties.<br/><br/>My name is Ashley Boren and I am the author of <i>Kat &amp; Stella</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to explore the ways people use their platforms for positive change. I also wanted to create characters who have multiethnic identities that people can relate to.<br/><br/><i>Kat &amp; Stella </i>is a fiction book that speaks to fans of contemporary fiction and tales of fame who are interested in considering how each of us can use our platforms in a positive way.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that everyone has a story worth telling and the ability to help people. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for societal change in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you think about what contribution you want to make to your communities.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about the significance of giving back and personal identity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kat urges Stella to use her platform for good. Kat would ideally have Stella standing up against huge issues like prison reform, climate change, and injustice. When Stella insists that she only cares about music, Kat decides Stella should release the personal, authentic songs she’s too afraid to share with the world. Kat realizes the best way for Stella to help others is through her music, even if that’s not what Kat originally had in mind.</li>
<li>The two main characters, Kat and Stella, are both multiethnic: half-White and half-Mexican. They each have different experiences due to their last names, physical appearances, and the connections they have to their families and culture.</li>
<li>In the book, you’ll see Stella deal with heartbreak over her ex-girlfriend, Marisol. Stella must learn how to move on from the girl she thought she was going to marry. You’ll read flashbacks to how they met, and learn what tore them apart.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are fascinated by the world of fame and celebrities, if you enjoy stories of friendship, heartbreak, and growth, if you’ve ever wondered if you could be doing something more meaningful with your life, or if you’ve ever longed to see characters of multiethnic and LGBTQ+ identities front and center in a novel.</p>
<h2>The Book - Kat &amp; Stella</h2>
<p>The book is written in four parts....</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Part 1</strong>: Despite Kat’s best efforts, Stella makes it clear that she doesn’t need any of her help. You’ll see learn more about Stella’s daily life in recording studios, being followed by paparazzi, and her sibling-like relationship with her manager. Her life isn’t as picture-perfect as it seems on the outside. You’ll get glimpses into Kat’s relationship with her dad since her mom died and how she’s navigating her new life in New York City by herself.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part 2</strong>: As the two learn more about each other, such as the truth behind the headlines about Stella’s estrangement from her parents, the girls form an unlikely friendship. Stella struggles with her breakup and the loneliness that comes with fame, while Kat enjoys life being single and wonders if she’s achieving all the goals she expected she would out of college.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part 3</strong>: Stella brings Kat to Bali as she starts recording personal songs, still afraid of releasing it for the whole world to hear. Stella doesn’t know if she can handle the criticism of music that feels like an extension of herself. As Kat stresses about the ethics of traveling and tourism, she also starts to find meaning in the natural world around her, such as the clear blue ocean waves and manta rays swimming beneath her. Kat starts to think she needs a balance— She can still work to fix societal issues without letting the beauty in daily life pass her by.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part 4</strong>:  Kat and Stella’s friendship is tested when Stella faces hate and she blames Kat for it. The story wraps up with Kat figuring out a new romance, Stella learning to look outside of herself past her own problems, and a high stakes night at the biggest awards show in the music industry.</li>

<p>Ashley Boren is a graduating senior at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), where she studies communication and professional writing.<br/><br/>Ashley decided to publish this book because writing a book has been on her list of life goals that she thought would happen later on, so when she got this opportunity she couldn’t pass it up. She struggled with the decision of what career she wanted to pursue when she graduated college, feeling torn in two directions— doing what she loves and what she’s excited about, or pursuing jobs she feel that she should do, such as non-profit work. This book comes out of that struggle, that tension— how can we each create positive change in any role we’re in? In the book, Stella might not be able to fix climate change, but maybe her music can bring her fans comfort and know that they aren’t alone.<br/><br/>When Ashley’s not writing, she enjoys watching The Bachelor, reading books, learning TikTok dances, journaling, and reading tarot cards.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Ashley at ashley.boren98@gmail.com, /ashleyboren on LinkedIn, @ashleyboren23 on Twitter, and @ashley.boren on Instagram.</p>

It’s a story packed with wild gambling, bandwagon-jumping, digital guerilla warfare, and diamond hands. It’s a story that, much like our entire lives at the moment, had no precedent, no rule book, and no map to follow. <br/> </p><p><strong>Why Back My Project?</strong></p><p>I believe that this story needs to be told by someone who has been totally immersed in the community since January.

This book began it’s conception last year in June. I was sitting on a friend’s balcony in Utrecht, Holland, witnessing the epicentre of three colliding thunderstorms. It was the culmination of weeks of muggy air, you could feel the clouds begging for release. Every breath you took was hot with energy. Thunder deafened the city as the sky was lit with blue and white forms of lightning from every angle. Sat on that balcony, I had just finished reading Naomi Klein’s This Changes Everything, and months of reading and thinking about the pandemic all began to fall into place in my mind. I had been quite pessimistic about how governments and institutions were handling the pandemic, but in that moment I realised that this need not be so. </p><p>When she wrote that book, Naomi Klein had spent over a decade writing about the impact of chaos and crisis upon nations and societies. Namely, she had been writing about a concept called The Shock Doctrine – it’s one I wrote about towards the end of my first book. The general thesis is that over the past 40-50 years, one particular school of economic thought has come to infiltrate and dominate almost all global institutions, from the halls of Congress, to the World Bank and the IMF. That is the Chicago School of Economics and the ideas of Milton Friedman and free-market neo-liberalism/aka globalisation. </p><p>This generally involves a triad of policies, privatisation and cuts to state spending, deregulation and corporate and top rate tax cuts, and the sale of state assets. It’s an ideology that has grown up alongside our bloated and corrupt financial system. It’s this mob who run the financial system who are lining the pockets of Congress, funding think tanks to produce reports and write policies designed to enrich themselves. The same firms then do everything in their power to pay any tax on the obscene wealth they are generating, hiding it offshore in the web of tax havens enabled by governments of the world. These policies are obviously not particularly popular with people, they can only be enacted in the midst of a crisis. That could be a civil or international war, a financial crash, or maybe a natural disaster.</p><p>In the book No Is Not Enough, Klein condemns Friedman’s ideology as an assault on the public interest: </p><p>The goal is all out war on the public sphere and the public interest, whether in the form of antipollution regulations or programs for the hungry. In their place will be unfettered power and freedom for corporations. It’s a program so defiantly unjust and so manifestly corrupt that it can only be pulled off with the assistance of divide-and-conquer racial and sexual politics, as well as a nonstop spectacle of media distractions. </p><p>The ultimate goal was to create a blank slate upon which the free-market could be introduced. In Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Indonesia, right-wing coups paired free market economists pushing economic ‘shock therapy’ with terror dished out by militaries and police forces. Many of the economists were students of Friedman himself. The Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation sponsored Chilean students to attend the Chicago School of Economics as a way of growing the academic influence of their ideas in Latin America.</p><p>Klein repeatedly compares the shocks experienced by these societies to the trauma experienced by victims of electroshock torture in countries like Chile and Iraq (and to victims of this kind of experimentation in the US governments MK Ultra program), ‘The shock doctrine mimics this process precisely, attempting to achieve on a mass scale what torture does one on one in an interrogation cell.’ The goal of the brutal electroshock techniques was to produce a blank slate upon which a new person could be built. The shocks were designed to soften up the victim, to ‘depattern’ them. There is a breaking point at which a victim of torture or electroshock therapy is much more susceptible to suggestion and willing to do or say things they would not normally. Similarly, the economic remedies prescribed by the ‘shock doctors’ are so unpalatable to the general public that they cannot be implemented without shock and chaos, manufactured or natural.  </p><p><strong>The Plague Arrives</strong></p><p>We’ve seen this happen across the world, from Latin America and Asia, to Ireland, Greece, and the former Soviet States. I argued in my book, Brexit: The Establishment Civil War that this ideology has also succeeded in three waves in Britain over the past 40 years, and that some form of shock, such as a hard Brexit or a financial crash, was going to be used by the current government to unleash a fourth wave of neo-liberalism upon Britain. It is the ideology that dominates both of the main parties on both sides of the Atlantic, unsurprisingly because it has been wildly profitable for their donors. That means we’re going to see (and we already have seen) attempts to further outsource and privatise public services, including the NHS, and cuts to more regulations and corporation taxes to “kickstart the economy”. Covid exposed the unbridled level of corruption imherent in our syste;, the outsourcing nightmare of the Test and Trace scheme cost over £37 billion for nothing, and the number of government friends and donors who were gifted multi-million pound contracts is obscene. Our leadership and media class have utterly failed us, lied to us, and used the crisis of covid to abdicate themselves from responsibility.</p><p>Despite the failure of our system and institutions, I believed, as Klein does too, that these moments of shock and chaos can provide chances for renewal and rebirth. Not Build Back Better or The Great Reset, or some other New World Order rubbish, but the kind of renewal that would see our faith in the system restored. Some kind of constitutional convention or review of our entire system, one run for and by the people, to root out the corruption and make it work to the benefit of the many, not the few. We need to, as Bret Weinstein often says, not throw the baby out with the bath water. We’ve got a pretty good system, we’ve just allowed it to become corrupted by a wealthy class of people who dominate most of the positions of power and influence. It’s lost its ability to self-regulate because of institutional capture. </p><p>The authors of the Fourth Turning believe that this kind of degradation and renewal is a part of the seasons of history, not an accident, but an inevitability of the evolution of civilisations. We begin with solid belief and trust in the institutions of society that we have built and bought into, but slowly as those institutions decay, public trust is lost and entropy sets in until a flash of chaos – war or revolution erupt. In the aftermath the children of the crisis rebuild and the cycle begins once more.  They predicted over 30 years ago that we would reach the flash point of chaos around 2025 – look at the world right now and tell me they were entirely wrong… </p><p>Economist and author Mark E. Thomas believes that since 1980, our economy has shifted from being geared towards the wealth and prosperity of everyone in society, as it was during the golden age of capitalism, towards catering to the very richest in society. Since 1980, wealth inequality has sky-rocketed, Millennials and Zoomers are no longer destined to become better off than their forefathers, and the amount of money and power accumulating in the hands of a shrinking class of people has led to the corruption of our system. That was before the pandemic and lockdowns, which led to the greatest upward wealth transfer in the history of the world – touching $8 trillion. Lockdowns hit the poorest in society the hardest, the wealthy have not suffered in the same way. </p><p>When I began to imagine where this ever-worsening situation might lead us, what hopes we might have to renew our faith in institutions and rebuild our system, purge it of the inherent corruption and block the revolving doors, I would never have imagined that the shining light in the darkness would be the store where I used to buy second hand games and CDs. GameStop. Even the name seemed to fit too perfectly – “Your rigged game stops here” – the party is over, welcome to the new world. Sometimes I think the simulation writers need to stop dropping such obvious hints. </p><p><strong>We Like The Stock</strong></p><p>I’ll happily admit to how much of a noob I was in the investing world, I was a filthy casual of finance in January. As I was first welcomed into the Ape encampment, I saw many veterans of finance and a lot of charts I didn’t understand covered in crayon scribbled lines. These looked intriguing, but it was the memes that drew me in. I had no idea what short selling meant, all I saw were funny pictures telling me to buy and hold this stock, because if we did this, it would ruin some hedge funds. This was to be revenge upon the crooks who crashed the economy in 2008 as Millenials were setting foot into the world (and creating the economic conditions for the world we live in today) – they gambled away the savings and homes of tens of millions, got bailed out by the taxpayer and then paid themselves obscene bonuses with the money and walked away scott free. All we had to do was hold the stock, for maybe a week or two, and we would make the criminals pay.</p><p>Fast forward a few months and I’ve tumbled so far down the rabbit hole I can no longer see the surface. Communication about what I’m seeing with the outside would is difficult, it’s like another planet down here. I’ve become one of the Apes. From the moment that Robinhood and a host of other trading apps halted buying on GameStop and a number of other so called “meme stocks” such as AMC, the war was on. A digital war; an information war. </p><p>The media tried everything in the book to discourage and distract the Apes; Rocket Company, Cryptos, Silver, and Weed Stocks, but nothing would work. They were quite clearly leaning on contacts in politics and media to slander Reddit and the online world as dangerous. The entire ruling class clapped back at an emergent revolution set to hit them where it hurt the most – their wallets. For me, this was proof that the internet and ordinary people could not only challenge powerful institutions, but they might even be able to beat them at their own game. There is no doubt in my mind that there have been multiple attempts by bad actors to infiltrate and manipulate conversations and discussion on a number of subreddits and other forums. Paranoia amongst the Apes was rife, bots and paid posters were reported in every forum – everything was questioned. At times the Apes seemed to turn on themselves, but the mantra always won in the end, Apes don’t fight Apes. Apes stronk together. The community split and divided as each forum was considered compromised, first from r/wallstreetbets, to r/wallstreetbetsnew, and beyond to r/DFV, r/GME, and the most remarkable online community of them all, r/superstonk. </p><p>Amongst the paranoia, 5th generational information warfare, and the media FUD campaign, something truly incredible began to happen. The community began to morph into a form of hive mind, reacting, teaching, and self-correcting in real time. The community was filled with highly educated traders and lengthy and indepth DD posts, helping to educate the new recruits, whilst the Knights of New patrolled the borders, downvoting shills and negative sentiment. Eventually, as the shills evolved, so too did the defences. The Apes learned how to spot shills and the moderators at Superstonk did something that none of us could have imagined. They built their own shill spotting algorithm to analyse users post history and determine whether they were a legitimate Ape or a paid shill. </p><p><strong>The Apes And The Hive Mind</strong></p><p>From February onward the Apes educated themselves and delved deeper and deeper into the world of finance, dark pools, and naked short selling. They recruited world leading experts like Dave Lauer, Wes Christian, Dr Susanne Trimbath, Carl Hagberg, and Lucy Komisar to help analyse and understand what was happening, hosting livestreams and getting the community to put forward questions and having them analyse their DD.</p><p>As the months trundled along and DDs like A House Of Cards, The Everything Short, and Citadel Has No Clothes were produced by u/attobit, u/Criand and other wrinkled brained apes, the community grew smarter and the horrors of the financial system were laid bare to them. They believed that the hedge funds had not covered their shorts, so they began to buy up the stock, vastly increasing their positions from the baby squeeze in January through the months until now. No-one, except perhaps for Ryan Cohen and GameStop knows how many shares are in circulation or if retail investors own the equivalent of the entire company (which I highly suspect they do) – no one knows how this ends. So as well researched and thought out the DD may be, the Apes still don’t really know what’s going to happen. This is a story that, much like our entire lives at the moment, has no precedent, no rule book, and no map to follow. That’s what makes it so fascinating to me. The retarded Apes of Superstonk and Reddit are going toe to toe with some of the most powerful institutions on the planet, the entire system might be about to come crashing down; but we’re ready to go. Buckled: Up and Tits: Jacked. We’ve got our tickets to the moon, but we cannot know how high she will fly. Has this community become the purest expression of what Reddit and the internet potential hive minds that we’ve seen to date? Have they spotted the fatal flaws in the financial system and found a way to punish the recklessness and greed of Wall Street? Or are they just a bunch of idiots on the internet? I can’t wait to find out. </p><p>This is the story I am telling. Just as the air had been hot with anticipation in the weeks leading up to the thunderstorms I began this story at, so too is the anticipation within the community starting to boil. They very structures of our world seem to be shaking, the madness continues to escalate, and uncertainty is everywhere. There is rage, anger, and desperation bubbling just beneath the surface of our world and the financial system may be sitting on a bed of fireworks about to go off. Amidst the madness of 2021, the Apes have forged a beautiful, intelligent, tight-knit community, one that has renewed some of my faith in humankind in a way I had never imagined the internet would do. It’s been full of encouragement, curiosity and genuine care. Superstonk, and the other communities that have emerged are a hive mind the likes of which we’ve never seen before. It’s madness and brilliance, insanity and genius all rolled into one. </p><p>This book is an attempt to chronicle and explain the GameStop saga, the psychological games that were played, the extraordinary online community that rose to this historic occasion, and the financial warfare that has taken place on a new digital frontier. It is a journey through complex stock market jargon, memes, and in-jokes created by r/WallStreetBets (an online forum on reddit.com) and the other online communities that sprung up around it. It’s a story packed with wild gambling, bandwagon-jumping, digital guerilla warfare, and diamond hands. </p><p>I want your help in telling this story about the GameStop apes. How they evolved into a functioning hive mind, all in the pursuit of some tendies, and meme’d their way into the history books – just because they liked the stock. </p><p>You can help me tell this story by ordering my book on my crowd-funding campaign. It’s one I think the world needs to hear. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Background Research and Interviews</strong></p><p>As part of my research for this topic I've conducted a number of interviews on my podcasts with some of the foremost experts on the topic and some YouTubers and others associated with the Apes. I'll be continuing to talk to experts on the topic and welcome any recommendations on experts or people to talk to, you can send them to josh@thejist.co.uk.  </p><p>Chatter #158 - Dr Susanne Trimbath on GameStop, Failure To Delivers, and Naked Short Selling - <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITeiFwJlGGI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITeiFwJlGGI</a></span></p><p>Chatter #134 - Houston Wade On How GameStop Happened, Naked Shorts, and FTDs - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7bBJlXPy9A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7bBJlXPy9A</a></p><p>Chatter #138 - Houston Wade On Dark Pool Trading, Dogecoin, And Trillion Dollar Asteroids - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skvMJGPYjUg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skvMJGPYjUg</a></p><p>Chatter #133 - William Steele On GameStop And The Internet Hive Mind - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CbR2AmYnXw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CbR2AmYnXw</a> - **William is the editor of this book!**</p><p>Chatter #156 - Lucy Komisar On The SEC, Regulatory Capture, And The Corruption Of Wall Street - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVDVvj3GL8E"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVDVvj3GL8E</a></p><p>Chatter #155 - Carl Hagberg on Short Sellers, Counterfeit Shares, and Shareholders Rights - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM-kd0TSg3w"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM-kd0TSg3w</a></p><p>Chatter #154 - Mulligan Brothers on Superstonk, GameStop, and the Apes Together Strong Documentary - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MkFSK-WWs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MkFSK-WWs</a></p><p>Chatter #149 - Andrew Mo Money On Short Squeezes, Reddit Manipulation, And Retail Investor Power - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KH1w9gNiQw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KH1w9gNiQw</a></p><p>Chatter #147 - Jackson Hunter On The AMC Short Squeeze, GameStop, And The Power Of Reddit - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btfFFdMGcx0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btfFFdMGcx0</a></p><p> </p><p>I've also  made several videos essays on the topic.</p><p>Tendies For All: What The Media Are Missing About The GameStop Saga - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJNIvLHYXk8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJNIvLHYXk8</a></p><p>The Joke Market: DogeCoin, GameStop, And Investing Gone Viral - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9M9rdc1W94"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9M9rdc1W94</a></p><p> </p></div>","I am telling the story of the GameStop saga, but not the one you'll find in the mainstream press.This book is an attempt to chronicle and explain the GameStop saga, the psychological games that were played, the extraordinary online community that rose to this historic occasion, and the financial warfare that has taken place on a new digital frontier.It is a journey through complex stock market jargon, memes, and in-jokes created by r/WallStreetBets (an online forum on reddit.com) and the other online communities that sprung up around it.

The retarded Apes of Superstonk and Reddit are going toe to toe with some of the most powerful institutions on the planet, the entire system might be about to come crashing down; but we’re ready to go. Buckled: Up and Tits: Jacked. We’ve got our tickets to the moon, but we cannot know how high she will fly. Has this community become the purest expression of what Reddit and the internet potential hive minds that we’ve seen to date? Have they spotted the fatal flaws in the financial system and found a way to punish the recklessness and greed of Wall Street? Or are they just a bunch of idiots on the internet? I can’t wait to find out. This is the story I am telling. Just as the air had been hot with anticipation in the weeks leading up to the thunderstorms I began this story at, so too is the anticipation within the community starting to boil. They very structures of our world seem to be shaking, the madness continues to escalate, and uncertainty is everywhere. There is rage, anger, and desperation bubbling just beneath the surface of our world and the financial system may be sitting on a bed of fireworks about to go off. Amidst the madness of 2021, the Apes have forged a beautiful, intelligent, tight-knit community, one that has renewed some of my faith in humankind in a way I had never imagined the internet would do. It’s been full of encouragement, curiosity and genuine care. Superstonk, and the other communities that have emerged are a hive mind the likes of which we’ve never seen before. It’s madness and brilliance, insanity and genius all rolled into one. This book is an attempt to chronicle and explain the GameStop saga, the psychological games that were played, the extraordinary online community that rose to this historic occasion, and the financial warfare that has taken place on a new digital frontier. It is a journey through complex stock market jargon, memes, and in-jokes created by r/WallStreetBets (an online forum on reddit.com) and the other online communities that sprung up around it. It’s a story packed with wild gambling, bandwagon-jumping, digital guerilla warfare, and diamond hands. I want your help in telling this story about the GameStop apes. How they evolved into a functioning hive mind, all in the pursuit of some tendies, and meme’d their way into the history books – just because they liked the stock. You can help me tell this story by ordering my book on my crowd-funding campaign. It’s one I think the world needs to hear.  Background Research and InterviewsAs part of my research for this topic I've conducted a number of interviews on my podcasts with some of the foremost experts on the topic and some YouTubers and others associated with the Apes. I'll be continuing to talk to experts on the topic and welcome any recommendations on experts or people to talk to, you can send them to josh@thejist.co.uk.  Chatter #158 - Dr Susanne Trimbath on GameStop, Failure To Delivers, and Naked Short Selling - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITeiFwJlGGIChatter #134 - Houston Wade On How GameStop Happened, Naked Shorts, and FTDs - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7bBJlXPy9AChatter #138 - Houston Wade On Dark Pool Trading, Dogecoin, And Trillion Dollar Asteroids - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skvMJGPYjUgChatter #133 - William Steele On GameStop And The Internet Hive Mind - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CbR2AmYnXw - **William is the editor of this book!**Chatter #156 - Lucy Komisar On The SEC, Regulatory Capture, And The Corruption Of Wall Street - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVDVvj3GL8EChatter #155 - Carl Hagberg on Short Sellers, Counterfeit Shares, and Shareholders Rights - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM-kd0TSg3wChatter #154 - Mulligan Brothers on Superstonk, GameStop, and the Apes Together Strong Documentary - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MkFSK-WWsChatter #149 - Andrew Mo Money On Short Squeezes, Reddit Manipulation, And Retail Investor Power - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KH1w9gNiQwChatter #147 - Jackson Hunter On The AMC Short Squeeze, GameStop, And The Power Of Reddit - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btfFFdMGcx0 I've also  made several videos essays on the topic.Tendies For All: What The Media Are Missing About The GameStop Saga - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJNIvLHYXk8The Joke Market: DogeCoin, GameStop, And Investing Gone Viral - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9M9rdc1W94",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>About the Story </h2>
<p>The Color Orange is a beautiful story about Robbie and how he goes through his colorful life; diving into self-discovery and doing so through a lens of being neuro-diverse. <br/><br/>My name is Me’Chele Sevanesian and I am the author of The Color Orange. I wrote this book because I think it is so important to have more than one story to break stigmas around cultures and ethnicities. I want to go to Law school and represent people with disabilities and such. I felt like this book was a great way to begin my journey and do my favorite thing: write. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will become friends with my characters and miss them like I often do. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to find more color in life and understand that being content in yourself as much as any other person is a journey. Find yourself escaping the social stigmas that you were taught about Autism or any disability and learn alongside Robbie about the importance of putting your needs first.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<p>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</p>
<p>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this August, 2021.</p>
<br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.<br/><br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<p>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</p>

<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;"">My name is Mark Price, and I'm a 24 year old from Scotland in the United Kingdom. When I was at school I never ever thought I'd end up writing my own book. However, here I am, and within the pages, is a message which literally means everything to me. It means everything to me because it details my journey from resistance to acceptance. </span><br/>
</h3>
<p>Resistance and acceptance of what, you might ask?</p>
<p>Well, after resisting for 24 years, I finally accepted the people who gave me everything . . . my parents!</p>
<p>That might sound as though I lived life very selfishly before that point, and I guess in a way, you'd be right to think that. It wasn't all selfishness though. It was fear. Fear of embarrassment, fear of rejection, fear of the unknown. </p>
<p>Growing up, cuddling was never a part of our daily routine. </p>
<p>You know when people say ""You don't know what you've got until it's gone""? Well, it was the opposite for me with cuddling. It was more like ""You don't know what you don't have until you experience it"". </p>
<p>This was something I realised fairly recently. <br/></p>
<p>Over the last few years I've been on several personal development courses and a combination of those courses and the people I've met along the way, helped me to see what was missing from my life. </p>
<p>At every one of those courses, there were lots of cuddles. Generally, in the mornings everyone would greet each other with one and then occasionally again in the evenings when the course would finish. It felt very strange doing it, simply because it wasn't something I was used to.</p>
<p>Just a few months ago, I realised how something which I used to find very difficult had, over time, become very easy. I started to find it such a natural thing to do when I attended the more recent courses. </p>
<p>However, on one of those recent courses (which was just a few months ago) I did wonder, ""could I make cuddling as easy as this at home?""</p>
<p>After a chat with some friends on the final night of that course, I made the decision that when I flew home, I would give my Mum and Dad a cuddle for the very first time. </p>
<p>Just to clarify <b>the very first time</b> for you:</p>
<p>I had probably cuddled my Mum a few times at parties after a few pints of beer. My Dad, I don't think I had cuddled - even at parties. Maybe a handshake at most.</p>
<p>So, the cuddling that went on when I got home from that course was the first time I had made a <i>real </i>decision to do it. And, I'm sure that with my own personal story, I can help other people overcome the fears that they have when it comes to making connections with the people in their lives.</p>
<p>Who knows, that person may even be you . . . </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why Would You Even Think About It?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>You might be wondering ""Why would I want to get involved in cuddling?""</p>
<p>I believe that we all want the very same thing from life, we just go about getting it in some very different ways. That <i>thing</i>, is connection. Gangs, Work Colleagues, Friends, Family . . . we see connection everywhere. Of course, some methods of connection are viewed as being positive and others as being negative.</p>
<p>However, fundamentally they are all the same!</p>
<p>My personal thoughts are that the connection we are looking for can be made simply through cuddling. <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Would you like to be one of the people who really help to bring the world together through making connections?</li>
<li>Would you like to build positive connections with new people who come in to your life?</li>
<li>Would you like to re-build connections that you once had and bring those special people back into your life?</li>
<li>Would you like to change someone's life by helping them get the connection that they want in their lives?</li>
</ul>
<p>These may be some reasons as to why you'd want to get yourself involved in cuddling.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>What Will You Get For Being A Part Of 'It's Only A Cuddle'?<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;""> </span>
</h3>
<p>I thought about publishing my book in the traditional way. Now, when I say traditional, I mean quite simply to have it printed and made available for purchase. However, that is boring. Very boring. So, when I saw the structure of Indiegogo and understood how Crowdfunding works, it was a no brainer!</p>
<p>The layout of Indiegogo allows you to get EXACTLY what you want. And, it's usually very nice to get what you want, isn't it?</p>
<p>People who are willing to help me take my message out in to the world deserve way more than just a book.</p>
<p>So, I have created various options for you to get involved with 'It's Only A Cuddle . . .' They vary from having your name listed in the 'YOU made it happen' section of the book, through to getting a cuddle in person, from me.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How Will The Funding Be Used?</h3>
<p>Firstly, I'd like to let you know that ANY contributions toward making it possible for me to get this message heard, will always be remembered. And I really do mean, always remembered. I will also <b>personally</b> thank each and every one of you. </p>
<p>With that said, I'm aware that the question you're probably desperate to ask is ""How will the funding be used?""</p>

know I have changed their lives.  It will also change <i>your </i>life.  How,
you might ask?  Well, the next time you get invited to a wedding and you
open the invitation with dread because you ""have"" to go to another
""boring"" wedding, you will remember that there is a book YOU helped
make possible out there.  You can give it to the couple as an engagement gift
and go to a wedding that is fun and meaningful instead of boring and the same
as every other wedding.  The couple will be so grateful to you and you
will be grateful to you as well as your laughing and having a good time instead
of sitting at the table wondering when it's appropriate to leave.</span><span style=""font-family: Helvetica;""></span></p><p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p><p></p></div>","Hello, my name is Jenna Edwards
and I am passionate about sharing!  And, with this project I want to share
how I was able to take my experience with film producing, organizing and my
desire to make everything I do mean something and incorporate it into a wedding
far and above what I could have dreamed possible.I am very honored that
you have stopped by my page and are reading what I've written here.
Let me give you a little
background on why this topic and book are so important to me.  I met my
now husband (Craig) in 1999, in 2000 we moved to Los Angeles.  In 2003, I
was hit when an elderly man drove through  the Santa Monica Farmer's
Market. The crash killed 10 people and injured over 60 of us.  I often say
that when the car hit me, it knocked the joy right out of my body.
I suffered severe Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  I thought only military could get
PTSD...boy was I wrong.  I couldn't read, I stuttered when I talked, I
forgot basic words.  I was having flashbacks everyday that would send me
into panic attacks that would cause me to pass out.  I didn't sleep for 8
months and ended up in the psych ward after trying to take an entire bottle of
sleeping pills.  Not because I wanted to die, but because I wanted to
sleep so bad that I didn't care how I did it.  
The entire time, Craig
was by my side.  
It took me over 3 years
before I could get back to work and over 7 years before the flashbacks
completely stopped.  When I finally healed, I felt this overwhelming need
to share my experience in the hope that it would let others know that they
could lead the lives they always wanted to...even though sometimes it seems
hopeless. (you can read more of my story here)
I never thought I would
get married.  I really didn't.  We had been together for so long and
been through so much, that it just felt like...why?...until, one day, Craig
proposed and there was a flood of emotion I never knew was there.  It as
magical.  
I set out on a
3-year-journey to plan the perfect celebration of where we had been and where
we were going.  Things came up emotionally that I didn't expect and the
journey was one of amazing discovery culminated in a dream-come-true-wedding
that I will never forget.  
I want to share that
journey with future brides and grooms in order to help make their days just as
meaningful, magical, fun and unforgettable as mine was.  
This project is the
first project since before the crash that is completely my heart.  It
combines all of the lessons I have learned up until this point.  It also
allows me to work with things I'm passionate about: Organizing, Producing,
Helping Others Create Their Lives and Love.
 

What We Need
The biggest thing my
film producing career has taught me is; you can create something for next to
nothing but it takes a lot more to market your creation and share it with the
world than you think.
That said, you maybe
wondering why my book and campaign is higher than most books.  I'll tell
you...because I don't want it to be a book for me that sits on my shelf that no
one sees.  I want to be able to market it and get it out into the world.  Therefore,
I am asking for not just money to create the book (which, because it will have
a lot of images as well as text makes it more expensive to produce from the get
go) but because I don't want you to give me money to create something that sits
on my shelf.
I'll never forget the
first time I got to see a movie I produced on the big screen in front of a big
audience or be able to tell people that they could buy the movie on Amazon.
I want that for all of
us.  I want to create a product that you will be proud to say ""I
helped make that happen"".  I want you to be able to walk into a
Barnes and Noble and see the book on the shelf and know it was because of you.  
That's why the amount
I'm looking to raise is more than some other books. 
I'm also very proud of
my track record with film budgets and know that things cost more than they
appear a lot of the time.  So, I have done my research.  I don't want
to ask for an amount and not be able to carry through on the delivery of a
product.  I understand that I am asking you to believe in my by parting
with your hard earned money.  I do not take that lightly.  
HERE IS THE BREAKDOWN
Production =
$23,000
This will be used to
hire an editor, proof reader, designer and typesetter.  I have spent a lot
of time working for free and asking others to work for free on creative
endeavors.  I will be working for free on this book, but that's because
it's my book.  I do not want to ask other creative
professionals to do this for free so a good portion of the cost will go toward
hiring professionals because frankly, I need a good editor and I have no idea
how to use photoshop :-)
Release =
$18,000
This money will go
toward publishing and marketing the book. Including a book tour.  I toyed
around with the idea of doing two separate campaigns, but concluded that (1) I
would rather spend my time creating the book than focusing on another campaign
and (2) that I would feel better writing the book knowing I will be able to
release it so that you don't feel I wasted your belief in what I'm doing.

I know it's a wedding book, but in my opinion it's a wedding book that
can change people's lives.  That might sound funny, but if I can help
another couple have a wedding that was a tenth the amount of fun as ours was, I
know I have changed their lives.  It will also change your life.  How,
you might ask?  Well, the next time you get invited to a wedding and you
open the invitation with dread because you ""have"" to go to another
""boring"" wedding, you will remember that there is a book YOU helped
make possible out there.  You can give it to the couple as an engagement gift
and go to a wedding that is fun and meaningful instead of boring and the same
as every other wedding.  The couple will be so grateful to you and you
will be grateful to you as well as your laughing and having a good time instead
of sitting at the table wondering when it's appropriate to leave.
 

Other
Ways You Can Help

I
am grateful you are even reading this and believe me, I completely understand
if you can't afford to contribute money.  But, if you would please share
this campaign with your people, I would be eternally grateful.
Also,
if you have any ideas on cross promotion or other ways that I might be able to
get the book made and marketed, I am open to hearing them.
Thank
you so much!

</div><div>
<p>“Machine Gum” è un racconto di
formazione che vede come protagonista il giovane Danko Kevlar. Un ragazzo che
voleva fare il regista cinematografico e che invece si ritrova in un girone
infernale di eventi casuali a cui non riesce a dare un senso. Un racconto
d’avventura e di vendetta. Un romanzo strutturato su due linee temporali. Il
presente, narrato dal protagonista in prima persona. Il futuro, raccontato
paradossalmente al passato remoto da un narratore onnisciente. La stessa
persona vista in due momenti diversi della propria vita. Due personaggi uguali ma
allo stesso tempo molto differenti. Un giovane problematico, insicuro e deluso
che nel giro di un decennio si è trasformato in un personaggio ricco e
spietato, capace di uccidere a sangue freddo e senza provare il minimo rimorso.

now moved into the 'In Demand' phase.  To make a donation, click on one of the 'perks' - you'll then see an option to customise the donation if the exact amount you have in mind isn't covered by one of the perks.  A million thanks for all your incredibly generous contributions.</p><p>*  *  *</p><p>Hi, I’m James Kelly.  I write the pro-independence blog Scot Goes Pop, which over the years has carved out a niche for itself with its detailed coverage of opinion polls.  During the independence referendum, it relentlessly challenged the agenda-driven misreporting of polls as showing that the Yes campaign were not even in the game.  In the run-up to the general election, it picked up the extraordinary SNP surge a few weeks earlier than the mainstream media and most other polling websites, mainly because it didn’t shy away from the controversial approach of looking at the Scottish subsamples of Britain-wide polls.  According to Google Analytics, an astonishing 210,000 unique visitors have read the blog over the last twelve months alone.  Even if only half of those people are in Scotland (and the true figure is likely to be higher than that), it means that over 2% of the country’s population has been reached.  Not bad for a one-person operation!</p><p>Throughout much of 2014 and 2015, writing Scot Goes Pop has been the equivalent of either a full-time job or a very time-consuming part-time job.  It simply wouldn’t have been possible to put in that level of commitment if it hadn’t been for your incredibly generous contributions to two fundraisers – the first in May 2014, and the second in September 2014.  Between them, they raised over £9000.  For the avoidance of doubt, the fundraisers weren’t intended to cover the running costs of the blog – there aren’t really any running costs at all, and there won’t be any in future unless it becomes necessary to switch to a different platform.  A small percentage of the money was spent on drawing in new readers via adverts on social media, but the bulk of it simply helped cover my own living expenses.  I do have other sources of income, but obviously time spent blogging is time that I can’t spend earning money elsewhere.</p><p>The period covered by the second fundraiser ended with the general election in May.  Since then, I’ve held off from running a third, because I wanted to take time to consider what its exact purpose might be.  I’ve seriously toyed with the idea of following the example of a few fellow political bloggers, and scaling back on the blogging to concentrate on writing a book (for self-publication).  At other times, I’ve thought I’ll probably continue blogging as regularly as I’ve been doing recently, and perhaps even look at the possibility of using crowdfunding to commission the occasional opinion poll myself.  In all honesty, my plans are still very unclear, although I do know that I’d like to continue writing regularly in some form.  Unfortunately, financial pressures have very suddenly come to a head, and I now realise that I can’t wait for the mists to clear in my mind before I attempt to raise some more funds.</p><p>When I first explained this dilemma in May, a number of you very kindly said that you appreciate the large amount of work I’ve put into the blog, and would be willing to make a donation in recognition of that.  I believe the internet jargon is “buying me a coffee”.  The only snag is that I detest the taste of coffee.  Luckily, however, I do seem to spend a fair percentage of my life in Edinburgh or Glasgow coffee shops drinking hot chocolate, ideally with cream and chocolate sprinkles on top.  So perhaps the best way of looking at this fundraiser is as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity (and you know what that means) to buy me a hot chocolate or two if you’ve enjoyed the blog, and don’t want to see me go thirsty (sniff) as I endeavour to keep writing in the months to come.</p><p>In case you don’t know much about me, I’ve been blogging at Scot Goes Pop for seven-and-a-half years now.  I’ve also written articles for The National newspaper, and for numerous websites including the International Business Times, Bella Caledonia, Wings Over Scotland, Political Betting, National Collective, Fair Observer, Scottish Roundup and the Eurovision Times.  Many of my IBTimes articles have been syndicated on Yahoo News.  I was interviewed twice on BBC Breakfast during the week of the referendum, and I’ve taken part in several alternative media podcasts and videos.  Oh, and as I never let anyone forget, I was a runner-up in

fundraiser is still open for donations!  Having reached its initial target by the deadline, it has now moved into the 'In Demand' phase.  To make a donation, click on one of the 'perks' - you'll then see an option to customise the donation if the exact amount you have in mind isn't covered by one of the perks.  A million thanks for all your incredibly generous contributions.*  *  *Hi, I’m James Kelly.  I write the pro-independence blog Scot Goes Pop, which over the years has carved out a niche for itself with its detailed coverage of opinion polls.  During the independence referendum, it relentlessly challenged the agenda-driven misreporting of polls as showing that the Yes campaign were not even in the game.  In the run-up to the general election, it picked up the extraordinary SNP surge a few weeks earlier than the mainstream media and most other polling websites, mainly because it didn’t shy away from the controversial approach of looking at the Scottish subsamples of Britain-wide polls.  According to Google Analytics, an astonishing 210,000 unique visitors have read the blog over the last twelve months alone.  Even if only half of those people are in Scotland (and the true figure is likely to be higher than that), it means that over 2% of the country’s population has been reached.  Not bad for a one-person operation!Throughout much of 2014 and 2015, writing Scot Goes Pop has been the equivalent of either a full-time job or a very time-consuming part-time job.  It simply wouldn’t have been possible to put in that level of commitment if it hadn’t been for your incredibly generous contributions to two fundraisers – the first in May 2014, and the second in September 2014.  Between them, they raised over £9000.  For the avoidance of doubt, the fundraisers weren’t intended to cover the running costs of the blog – there aren’t really any running costs at all, and there won’t be any in future unless it becomes necessary to switch to a different platform.  A small percentage of the money was spent on drawing in new readers via adverts on social media, but the bulk of it simply helped cover my own living expenses.  I do have other sources of income, but obviously time spent blogging is time that I can’t spend earning money elsewhere.The period covered by the second fundraiser ended with the general election in May.  Since then, I’ve held off from running a third, because I wanted to take time to consider what its exact purpose might be.  I’ve seriously toyed with the idea of following the example of a few fellow political bloggers, and scaling back on the blogging to concentrate on writing a book (for self-publication).  At other times, I’ve thought I’ll probably continue blogging as regularly as I’ve been doing recently, and perhaps even look at the possibility of using crowdfunding to commission the occasional opinion poll myself.  In all honesty, my plans are still very unclear, although I do know that I’d like to continue writing regularly in some form.  Unfortunately, financial pressures have very suddenly come to a head, and I now realise that I can’t wait for the mists to clear in my mind before I attempt to raise some more funds.When I first explained this dilemma in May, a number of you very kindly said that you appreciate the large amount of work I’ve put into the blog, and would be willing to make a donation in recognition of that.  I believe the internet jargon is “buying me a coffee”.  The only snag is that I detest the taste of coffee.  Luckily, however, I do seem to spend a fair percentage of my life in Edinburgh or Glasgow coffee shops drinking hot chocolate, ideally with cream and chocolate sprinkles on top.  So perhaps the best way of looking at this fundraiser is as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity (and you know what that means) to buy me a hot chocolate or two if you’ve enjoyed the blog, and don’t want to see me go thirsty (sniff) as I endeavour to keep writing in the months to come.In case you don’t know much about me, I’ve been blogging at Scot Goes Pop for seven-and-a-half years now.  I’ve also written articles for The National newspaper, and for numerous websites including the International Business Times, Bella Caledonia, Wings Over Scotland, Political Betting, National Collective, Fair Observer, Scottish Roundup and the Eurovision Times.  Many of my IBTimes articles have been syndicated on Yahoo News.  I was interviewed twice on BBC Breakfast during the week of the referendum, and I’ve taken part in several alternative media podcasts and videos.  Oh, and as I never let anyone forget, I was a runner-up in Fish Publishing’s Micro-fiction competition in May 2008 (which come to think of it was the same month I started the blog – I must have been on fire that month).I’m going to make the same commitment that I made during the previous two fundraisers – if for any reason I can’t put the money to good use to support my writing, I’ll pass whatever is left onto other pro-independence causes.  Or conceivably I might use it to run an opinion poll if there happens to be enough to cover that, but either way you can rest assured that nothing will go to

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>My name is Noah. I'm 7 years old and live in San Diego, California.</strong> I made this journal to <strong>help people feel better and raise money to fight cancer. </strong>This campaign is important to me because when I talk about my feelings or write them down I feel better, and I think it will help other people do this too. </p>
<p><strong>I made up this journal idea myself one day and my dad said it was AMAZING.</strong> I don't know exactly why but he really liked it (my dad is weird like that sometimes). I made some copies on our printer at home for my friends and family and they liked it too, so <strong>now I want to make a WHOLE LOT more copies for other people too.</strong></p>
<p><i>(Here's what my dad says...)</i></p>
<p>Noah really did come up with this idea completely on his own. He's a remarkable kid as you probably already know if you're reading this. <strong>One day he just showed up in the living room and he had these journals he'd stapled together, </strong>one that said ""Very Bad Days - write your own"" and another that said ""Very Good Days, write your own"", with blank pages inside that he and I could write on. </p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately Noah has seen more bad days than any kid should.</strong> His mom - my wife Sandy - was diagnosed with breast cancer when Noah was just two years old, and we recently said goodbye to her after a five year battle. When Noah created his first journals, Sandy was in the middle of another round of chemo treatments; she was in a lot of pain and was spending most of her time in bed. No question there were some Very Bad Days. But there were some Very Good Days too as our friends and family pulled together to help in unbelievable and miraculous ways.</p>
<p><strong>We're dedicating this journal project to Sandy's memory.</strong> We hope to help other people who are facing tough times, and also raise a little money so that someday other kids won't have to go through what Noah and his sister did. </p>
<p><strong>After costs, 50% of the proceeds will go to cancer research, and the rest will go to Noah's college fund.</strong>  This comes to about $2 donated for every journal we sell (of course some of the ""perks"" create higher levels of donations). <strong>We're putting together a small fund in Sandy's name</strong> that will be split between Moore's Cancer Center where she was treated, and new groundbreaking research into metabolic treatments for cancer being done out of Boston University. <strong>It's my belief that this Boston University research is the key to ""one cause, one cure"" for cancer that can be accomplished in our lifetime.</strong> Unfortunately these treatments didn't arrive in time for Sandy, but with your help maybe they will be there for the other moms (and dads and kids) who will battle this horrible disease in the future. Many of these promising treatments aren't patentable and so aren't getting the funding they need to get into the mainstream. We hope to do our small part to change that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>We need at least $900 to print our first 100 journals. </strong>That covers production and raises the first $200 for the Sandy Orion Memorial Fund. We'll see where we can take it from there, but the first step is to achieve a win for Noah and his sister with this first goal.</p>
<p>Of course the more money we raise, the more journals we can make and the lower our unit production costs will be, so that will create more donations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For $9, you'll get a copy of our ""Very Good Days / Very Bad Days"" journal.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you contribute $25, Noah will write a personal message for you in your copy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you contribute $50 or more, your name will also go on the list of key supporters at the back of each journal.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>We're confident that with our amazing network of friends and family we will beat this first goal. But if we don't for some reason, whatever amount we've raised will be donated in full to the charities mentioned above.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>(Dad talking again here...)</i><br/>We're hoping to accomplish a few things with this project. </p>
<p><strong>First, we want to raise money to contribute to research into cancer cures </strong>being done by independent teams that don't get ""big name"" funding.</p>
<p><strong>Second, we want to encourage other people facing challenges in life to write them down and express them.</strong> We're doing that in our family and it's making a big difference for us.</p>
<p><strong>Third, I want to show Noah that a great idea can be shared and create a real impact in the world. </strong>He has a real entrepreneurial streak - not sure where he gets it ;-) </p>
<p>I hope you will help Noah make his idea a reality ... supporting his first effort at social entrepreneurship while also contributing something to his mother's memory. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As IndieGogo campaigns go, this one is pretty low-risk. The only thing that could go wrong is that we miss our funding target, in which case all funds will be donated to the charities noted above.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Every person lives at a bottom of a deep well, which neither that person nor any other has access to. The name of that well is the subconscious. Dreams are more real than wakefulness - and more reliable too. Take it from a professional dreamer. If you allow me to tell stories, then I’ll invite you to watch one of my dreams in each of my stories.  I write adult fairytales inspired by the dreams deep within my subconscious.</p>
<p>My name is Fatemeh Zarei. I tell stories. I am a dreamer, and I’m crazy. I was born in Iran in 1969. I studied visual communication but my interest lies in the written word.</p>
<p>Thus far I have published a collection of short stories titled “Dreaming is my Profession” and a long story under the title “My Lover, My Killer.” I have another collection of short stories that is ready for publication, The novella I need your help writing and translating will be called <i>The Loader.</i></p>
<p>Sadly most of my stories are not publishable in Iran due to censorship.  My stories are as raw and interesting as the dreams that are presented to me.  I do not water down or censor myself. Therefore there is no possibility for me to reach my audience in Iran. Since I write in Persian, to reach an English audience I need to be able translate my work.

<h3>The Mission: Positive Representation of Our Cultural Heritage</h3>
<p>My name is Carolyn Emerick and I have been passionate about the culture of my European ancestors since childhood. I loved reading history, folklore, myth, and legendary tales that have been passed down over countless generations of our folk. My passion for the heritage of my own family coupled with the virulent attacks being hurled at my own heritage today encouraged me to launch Europa Sun, a cultural periodical for adults. <br/><br/>However, there is a need to represent Western cultural heritage positive for our youngsters as well. We have all seen unsavory politics and social messaging be hurled at children who are too young to process it. We have seen disturbing images of social miscreants reading stories to our children in the mainstream. We have seen messaging being slipped into our kids' media in an attempt to condition them early. <br/><br/>Enough is enough!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About the Series:</h3>
<p>Each book in this series is going to be themed around the history and lore of a different European country, culture group, or region. We will introduce the region with maps and some notable points of interest and pride.</p>
<p>Other sections in the book will cover various aspects of culture designed to pique a child's interest. So there will be a folk tale in the ""<strong>Legends &amp; Lore</strong>"" section; a ""<strong>Creature Feature</strong>"" depicting some of the fanciful creatures found in the local folklore; to encourage early interest in the history of our heritage as well as highlight our glorious past, there will be a ""<strong>Heroes from History</strong>"" section; and every book will end with ""<strong>Values of Valor</strong>,"" a section to highlight character building lessons that we can take from this exploration of history, culture, and heritage.</p>
<p>In addition to the books, my hope is to provide narrated audio to accompany each volume. Every child enjoys being read to. But, narrated stories were also something that I particularly enjoyed as a kid. It was fun to read a book with it being narrated on a cassette tape. So, each book will have the optional add on of MP3 or CD available.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Funding is Needed:</strong></h3>
<p>This series will need a number of elements that I am unable to provide myself and will need to commission. Original artwork will be the main expense. But, for the audio component, I will need to commission a theme song, purchase audio sound effects, and possibly purchase equipment. In addition, the project will take a great deal of my own time away from projects that could otherwise be earning income.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why This Matters:</h3>
<p>It has been reported in the news that psychological studies have found that a positive view of one's ancestors impacts so much on a psychological level, including self-confidence and higher achievement. ALL people in this world deserve a positive view of their own cultural heritage. <br/><br/>As one person, I cannot possibly represent the entire world, although I do fully support all people of all backgrounds celebrating their own culture. My goal is to celebrate MY culture and those other cultures of Europe that are closely related to my own. And, my hope is that others of other cultural backgrounds will do the same for their own heritage.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","The Mission: Positive Representation of Our Cultural Heritage
My name is Carolyn Emerick and I have been passionate about the culture of my European ancestors since childhood. I loved reading history, folklore, myth, and legendary tales that have been passed down over countless generations of our folk. My passion for the heritage of my own family coupled with the virulent attacks being hurled at my own heritage today encouraged me to launch Europa Sun, a cultural periodical for adults. However, there is a need to represent Western cultural heritage positive for our youngsters as well. We have all seen unsavory politics and social messaging be hurled at children who are too young to process it. We have seen disturbing images of social miscreants reading stories to our children in the mainstream. We have seen messaging being slipped into our kids' media in an attempt to condition them early. Enough is enough!

About the Series:
Each book in this series is going to be themed around the history and lore of a different European country, culture group, or region. We will introduce the region with maps and some notable points of interest and pride.
Other sections in the book will cover various aspects of culture designed to pique a child's interest. So there will be a folk tale in the ""Legends & Lore"" section; a ""Creature Feature"" depicting some of the fanciful creatures found in the local folklore; to encourage early interest in the history of our heritage as well as highlight our glorious past, there will be a ""Heroes from History"" section; and every book will end with ""Values of Valor,"" a section to highlight character building lessons that we can take from this exploration of history, culture, and heritage.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Thieves' Castle</strong> is a result of that particular fascination with Tudor history.  Writing historical fiction started essentially as my mid-life crisis. Not being able to afford a Ferrari, I sank my energy into writing and after three years of research, writing, re-writing and editing, my first book <strong>The Jesuit Letter</strong> emerged.</p>
<p>And it wasn't enough. I had the bug now and the only thing to do was to keep writing.</p>
<p><strong>Thieves' Castle</strong> is the result. It is 94,200 words of Elizabethan mayham. Set in 1576, it finds wayward ex-soldier turned play-actor Kit Tyburn penniless and back in London. Cut loose from both his mercurial employer Francis Walsingham and his playing troupe, Tyburn takes on the task of finding a missing goldseller who has absconded with the funds intended for construction of the first permanent theatre in London. But the alleys and laneways of London hold dark secrets, among them, a brutal Spanish conspiracy and a deadly thief-lord chasing her past.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The book was completed in late 2017 and the remainder of 2018 was spent chasing literary agents for representation. As anyone involved in publishing knows, finding representation can be a long and labourious task, and after more than a year of knocking on doors, I've decided to go down the self-publishing road once more.</p>
<p>This is where you come in. <strong>I need your help</strong>.</p>
<p>Creating a quality book requires a huge amount of preparation, work and expertise. Writing the book is only the first step in a long, and sometimes expensive, process. It requires a professional editor, technical layout for multiple ebook formats as well as for print, a superlative cover design (for both e-versions and print) and, in this case, a great illustrator to help develop a map of Elizabethan London to help those of us that don't have a ready familiarity to travel about the tale's locations.</p>

<h3>Budget &amp; Costs</h3>
<p>The funding target for this project is <strong>$6,000</strong>.</p>

<li>Cover Design: $1,000 - $1,200</li>
<li>Illustrated Map: $400 - $600</li>
<li>Layout Costs: $300</li>
<li>Delivery/Implementation: $300 - $500</li>
<li>Misc. Fees: $300 - $400</li>
<li>Any additional funding will be rolled into product launch and marketing</li>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>I've got a range of perks and rewards available for all levels of contributions including some very cool special ones including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic and print copies of all the books (<strong>The Jesuit Letter</strong> and <strong>Thieves' Castle</strong>) and the short novella <strong>Black Dog</strong>
</li>
<li>Entry into a draw for a real Tudor-era coin (Exact one to be determined) of at least $100 value</li>
<li>A signed, limited edition print of the London Map to be developed for the book</li>
<li>An opportunity to have your name used as a character in the next book (Sorcerer Street, currently in development). FYI, the main villain in <strong>Thieves' Castle</strong> is named after a contributor to my first Kickstarter for <strong>The Jesuit Letter</strong>... </li>
<li>Art bookmarks and postcards</li>
</ul>
<p>If we manage to <i>exceed</i> the set goals, I am looking at some additional stretch rewards including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invitation to a fabulous book launch party (date &amp; location to be determined)</li>
<li>Exclusive illustrated artwork of the main four characters</li>
<li>Hand-made traditional quatro/folio version of <strong>Black Dog</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If I don't meet the funding goals, then I will probably have to shelve <strong>Thieves' Castle</strong> unpublished, as I don't want to put out a product that doesn't meet the quality levels I think that readers deserve. While today's self-publishing tools make actual publication comparatively easy and cheap, developing quality isn't, and providing readers with a great reading experience is critically important.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your small contribution can and will make the difference in this project. It can help take the words on the page and transform them into a book that will be read around the globe! I actually have readers of my first book from Australia, Britain, Ireland, Germany, the United States, and Canada.</p>
<p>Most significantly to me, it will help me continue to bring my writing work forward, helping me gradually build a self-sustaining audience that will allow me to continue down this path for as long as I have tales to tell.</p>
<p>I know - it's only fiction. But everyone needs a little historical escapism, adventure and swashbuckling in their life!</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The book writing is 100% complete, barring the editing and actual publishing process. The risk to any contributor is minimal.</p>
<p>Is the writing any good? Well, everyone's opinions vary, but my first book <strong>The Jesuit Letter</strong> was an <i>Editor's Choice</i> by the Historical Novel Society and was short-listed for the <i>HNS Indie Award</i> in 2016. It was also a Semi-Finalist for the 2016 <i>M.M. Bennetts Award for Historical Fiction</i>, and a recipient of the Indie BRAG medallion. So, not too bad for a debut novel, and the second...is even <u>better</u>!</p>
<p>Further I guarantee that, at an <u>absolute</u> minimum, even if I don't achieve my full objectives for this project, all contributors of $10+ will get a copy of the new book (and of the already published works as well).</p>
<p>That's less than the cost of a Starbuck's vente Caramel Frappuccino and a cookie...and probably easier on your diet.</p>
<p>The key challenge is the funding campaign, as achieving less than the minimum required would necessitate revising plans, assessing budget requirements and probably reducing the likelihood of publication or at a minimum pushing publication off into the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>I don't plan of letting that become an issue. I plan to succeed and bring this book to publication. With you contribution and your help, it can happen!</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
              My
name is Alan Goya and after 25 years in point-of-purchase marketing, I wanted a
company that catered to an underserved, often ignored, but ever present market
that does what it takes to survive in good and bad times: retail mom and pop
neighborhood businesses.
I am the Proprietor of
MyCouponToday.com, in Boulder City, NV, a start-up company that will bring
free WiFi access to the citizens and visitors of small towns
and neighborhoods all across Nevada and perhaps one day to your community.
How is this possible? The same way “free” TV and newspapers used to
work, by having advertisers pay for the service.
Consumers using hand-held WiFi-enabled
devices enter MyCouponToday.com’s free WiFi
enabled neighborhood portals where they  receive direct advertising links to local attractions,
businesses and services within a controlled area.  The WiFi can be anywhere, visitor
centers, public spaces, shopping centers, a neighborhood or a store.
The controlled portal becomes an onsite marketing tool that
exposes consumers to all the businesses within the Neighborhood Core
Center.
I launched my first Neighborhood Core Center last summer in
Boulder City using my life savings, which ran out in January. The company
continues because an Angel Investor believed in me and provided enough funds to
take us through August.  We are
about to launch our second Neighborhood Core Center in the Arts District
Downtown Las Vegas and should begin to see a small but steady stream of income
begin at that time.  We will use
the revenue from downtown Las Vegas and Boulder City to give someone a
much-needed job.  And from there,
who knows?


 
The Impact







        MyCouponToday.com serves ""local"" businesses and
consumers. What difference does the national economy matter if your
neighborhood dies? Our impact is on the small business that needs affordable
help today and tomorrow;  who needs
to use technology to get them the critical advertising that will bring needed
new business.
It's also about local jobs. Our Account Executives live and work
in their neighborhoods. 
By promoting business in neighborhoods, MyCouponToday.com
encourages consumers to ""buy locally"" thus promoting the whole
community to reconnect with environmentally friendly modes of transportation
such as walking and bicycling.



What We Need & What You Get
         What is a neighborhood? 
Well, a neighborhood to a
MyCouponToday.com Advertising Executive is the area that can be serviced with
the MyCouponToday.com company vehicle: a bicycle.
         Being
green and keeping our Executives in shape allows us to see, discover and share
with our customers all the secret places we might miss zipping around in a car.
Our company vehicle is a moving sidewalk sign, with racks and baskets that
contain everything our Sales Executives need to sign up and connect new
businesses to MyCouponToday.com. 
         I
am trying to raise $3,000 to purchase 3 company bicycles for two Advertising
Executives and myself so that we can cruise our neighborhoods to promote the
company and bring business back to local companies. The bicycles are Electra
Deliveries, which costs $750, plus an additional $250 for custom graphics. My
existing funds are just enough to pay development, WiFi, and graphic designers.
The bicycles will enable us to promote the business and hit the streets without
spending our resources on gas and parking.
         If
you donate I'll send you a genuine Fisher Space Pen with our McT logo. (I’ll
ride over on my bicycle to get it.) Fisher Space Pen went on every manned space
mission since Mercury.  Invented by
Paul Fisher and produced in my home town, the pen that went to the moon and can
write underwater and upside down can also create your grocery list. 
         If
the $3,000 goal is not met, I'll buy as many bicycles as I can afford. But feel
assured I will buy them from a local dealer and get the money into the local
neighborhood.

<p>Last fall, <b>Wisconsin dairy farmer Joel Greeno, whose family had been farming for 140 years, made the gut-wrenching decision to sell his dairy
cows and get a job at a local fruit processing plant</b>. For 20 years, Joel has fought
for justice for farmers. He led a farmer tractorcade in support of the Wisconsin
public employees union (check out the video above from 2011!), testified before the the USDA and

<h2>My Zen Journey</h2>
<p>Plants and animals have always been a fascination since I was a little boy. My family always said I had a green thumb. I always found myself planting anything I could find just to watch it grow. I always watched my pet fish swim around for hours.

Plants and animals have always been a fascination since I was a little boy. My family always said I had a green thumb. I always found myself planting anything I could find just to watch it grow. I always watched my pet fish swim around for hours. I loved creating underwater worlds where I would watch my fish grow and even have babies. As I grew older I slowly lost that wonder and fell into the world of work and bills and forgot that part of myself. Once my nephew was born it changed everything. Watching him grow has been exciting.

Every item you see is one of a kind and you can make sure the one you own is truly one of a kindI also love creating zen gardens. They really give you such a sense of peace and relaxation especially if you are having a rough day.
I am asking for help from anyone who believes in peace and love. I believe the more terrariums i make the more happiness i will bring to peoples homes or offices. 

  My Dream One day i hope to turn this idea into a successful business where i decorate events like weddings and small venues to big beautiful events like The Grammys or The Oscars. I know i might be shooting for the stars but its my dream. 
In about a years time i will be decorating my sisters wedding and hoping that will help spread the word as well.

<p><b>Before the
Beginning Summary</b></p>
<p>I can’t thank you enough for your consideration of the <i>Before the Beginning</i> book mission.  This
mission addresses items that our contemporary world overlooks.  Our fast-paced
lifestyles blast us through life, causing us to miss tuning in to the many
miracles of creation that reveal design and intention.  Furthermore, we fail to
see that there is a story woven into the heart of each and every person by a compassionate Creator.  This book offers a help and perspective unlike any other— What does it mean to be created and to create, from the designer's perspective?</p>
<p>My name is Jim Kraft and I have been a communications
designer for 25 years.  I have worked with a broad array of corporations, from
start-up companies, to Fortune 500 businesses.  Before I begin to design a
project, I have much to consider.  In each case, I need to have a clear
understanding of the objectives, goals and even the mission of the companies
themselves<i> before</i> I sit down to
design anything.  Each product or service offered fulfills a certain need,
which I keep at the forefront of my mind.  Every product’s survival is dependent
upon how well it serves that need.  Even though I am experienced in man’s creation
process, I pause and reflect on the fact that each entity has its own
rules, environment and mission. In
addition, I need to walk in the shoes of the end-user and its use.  I am
constantly asking throughout the creation process who, what, when, where and
how.  The design aspects of what I create (with a small c) and what the Creator creates
are similar, though one designer is finite while the other is infinite.</p>
<p style="""">After reading <i>Before
the Beginning</i>, many credible and knowledgeable people have shared that they
believe this work is important, because it presses meaning into the mundane and
makes sense of the “nonsense” that life seems to offer.  I wanted to help people
experience the grandeur and awe that is already present in their daily lives, yet is so often missed.  Kind of like a child trying to find something in the fridge right in front of there noses.  </p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/878063/files/20140923204222-kidinfridgephoto.png?1411530142"" src="""" style=""width: 348.597px; height: 246px;""/></p><b>When we look deeper than the act of creation<i> we realize how much thought <br/><b><i><b><i>went into

</p>
<p><b>Stories of Addy and Anna</b> is a compilation of five short stories with colorful pictures for children age 3 to 5 year old. It has good values in a daily life for early childhood education.<br/></p>
<p>At first, we just plan to print this book in paperback
edition only for our local market. Later, we took the opportunity to put this book on Kindle edition so
that more children can enjoy reading this great book.  The
reviews from the readers are really encouraging. But, to be honest, even though it is a
delightful children’s book, it didn’t sell that much because we don’t have any
fund to do the promotion. Publishing the book is one thing, promoting the book
is another matter. <br/></p>
<p>Through Createspace, we have published the book as paperback edition for
international readers. The quality of the book is really good and we love
it so much. However, the price of the book is about $16. Even though we
consider it is cheap (since it has 72 pages with full color of 5 stories) we would
love to make it cheaper so that more children can enjoy this colorful storybook
– and parents can enjoy the cheaper price. Moreover, regular bookstores don't like to sell books from Createspace.<br/></p>
<p>Finally, we find a solution by making
the second edition with slightly smaller size, changing the paper and the color
quality as well. Through Ingram Spark, we can make this book available for the real bookstores - not just the online bookstores. We are able to sell the book to everybody around the world
with the average price of USD$8.80 - almost 45% less than the previous edition. After this, the future customers can choose either to buy the
previous edition (as premium edition for USD$16.00) or the Second Edition
(economy edition) for $USD8.80.  <br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>So now, the marketing part – the one
that we really need your contribution. </p>
<p>No matter how great any book is, people
will never know about it without a good marketing campaign and promotion.<span>  </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly we need to get into the right channel of
distribution.  We want to submit this
book into Ingram distribution network for the paperback and the ePub edition as
well. This will cost us USD$49 for the setup and another USD$12 for market
access fee. For now, we already manage to cover this cost. However, we would like to have the book in 5 more titles in different languages as well - Spanish, Italian, French, Chinese-English (bilingual) and Japanese-English (bilingual). These titles haven’t been setup yet and will cost us USD$305.00 in total. <br/>
</li>
<li>As one of the marketing strategy for the paperback
edition, we will submit this title to Ingram Children’s Advance Catalog. That will cost us USD$60.
We also will put the eBook edition as well inside Ingram eCentral eNewsletter
and that will cost us another $60. So in general, this will cost us USD$120.00 </li>
<li>Since we will publish this book in five other languages as well, all of these books (and the eBooks edition) will be
submitted into the same distribution channel just like as we stated above. So in total, we will need another USD$600 for this marketing strategy (USD$120 x 5 titles).
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, we will submit the book for a review with Kirkus.
This is really expensive to us but yet very important. We plan to choose express service (4-6 weeks) since
the standard service will take 7-9 weeks. The cost will be USD$575.00. We’ve been
told that Kirkus have a tendency to be 'mean and cruel' to indie author but
we have confident in our book and willing to take the risk. The review from
Kirkus, may be selected to be featured in their newsletter, which is
distributed to more than 50,000 industry professionals and consumers.  So the risk is worth it! Unfortunately, this is very pricey so we will submit only the English edition for Kirkus review.<br/></p>

<li>
<p>We are based in Malaysia and need to comply with Malaysian National Library's term and condition. In return of giving us the ISBN number for free, 5
 copies for each title must be given back to the National Library

 6 titles x 5 copies each) to be given to the National Library.

Stories of Addy and Anna is a compilation of five short stories with colorful pictures for children age 3 to 5 year old. It has good values in a daily life for early childhood education.
At first, we just plan to print this book in paperback
edition only for our local market. Later, we took the opportunity to put this book on Kindle edition so
that more children can enjoy reading this great book.  The
reviews from the readers are really encouraging. But, to be honest, even though it is a
delightful children’s book, it didn’t sell that much because we don’t have any
fund to do the promotion. Publishing the book is one thing, promoting the book
is another matter. 
Through Createspace, we have published the book as paperback edition for
international readers. The quality of the book is really good and we love
it so much. However, the price of the book is about $16. Even though we
consider it is cheap (since it has 72 pages with full color of 5 stories) we would
love to make it cheaper so that more children can enjoy this colorful storybook
– and parents can enjoy the cheaper price. Moreover, regular bookstores don't like to sell books from Createspace.
Finally, we find a solution by making
the second edition with slightly smaller size, changing the paper and the color
quality as well. Through Ingram Spark, we can make this book available for the real bookstores - not just the online bookstores. We are able to sell the book to everybody around the world
with the average price of USD$8.80 - almost 45% less than the previous edition. After this, the future customers can choose either to buy the
previous edition (as premium edition for USD$16.00) or the Second Edition
(economy edition) for $USD8.80.  

  What We Need & What You Get 



So now, the marketing part – the one
that we really need your contribution. 
No matter how great any book is, people
will never know about it without a good marketing campaign and promotion.  

Firstly we need to get into the right channel of
distribution.  We want to submit this
book into Ingram distribution network for the paperback and the ePub edition as
well. This will cost us USD$49 for the setup and another USD$12 for market
access fee. For now, we already manage to cover this cost. However, we would like to have the book in 5 more titles in different languages as well - Spanish, Italian, French, Chinese-English (bilingual) and Japanese-English (bilingual). These titles haven’t been setup yet and will cost us USD$305.00 in total. 

As one of the marketing strategy for the paperback
edition, we will submit this title to Ingram Children’s Advance Catalog. That will cost us USD$60.
We also will put the eBook edition as well inside Ingram eCentral eNewsletter
and that will cost us another $60. So in general, this will cost us USD$120.00 
Since we will publish this book in five other languages as well, all of these books (and the eBooks edition) will be
submitted into the same distribution channel just like as we stated above. So in total, we will need another USD$600 for this marketing strategy (USD$120 x 5 titles).


Next, we will submit the book for a review with Kirkus.
This is really expensive to us but yet very important. We plan to choose express service (4-6 weeks) since
the standard service will take 7-9 weeks. The cost will be USD$575.00. We’ve been
told that Kirkus have a tendency to be 'mean and cruel' to indie author but
we have confident in our book and willing to take the risk. The review from
Kirkus, may be selected to be featured in their newsletter, which is
distributed to more than 50,000 industry professionals and consumers.  So the risk is worth it! Unfortunately, this is very pricey so we will submit only the English edition for Kirkus review.


We are based in Malaysia and need to comply with Malaysian National Library's term and condition. In return of giving us the ISBN number for free, 5
 copies for each title must be given back to the National Library 
or we will be fined for about USD$825.00 (RM3000) for each title. In total, we have 6 titles (1 in English and 5 in other languages) so that we need to buy back 30 printed books (
 6 titles x 5 copies each) to be given to the National Library. 
Since we print the book either in USA or UK, the total cost plus 
shipping will be around $350.00



We will spend the rest of the money for other promotion like doing some promotion on Goodreads, hire a press release service, Facebook, Twitter and Bookdaily campaign, giveaway promotion,  etc.

We will have a special page on our official website (http://www.earlyreadersseries.com) to put the names of our contributors  from Indiegogo (Silver and Gold Supporter only) .  Since the book is based on 'print-on-demand', it's easy for us to add a few extra pages to put the list of the names of the Silver and Gold Supporter - only for the English title, Second Edition after we finish with this Indiegogo campaign. (Please note that we will make this book enable to buy even before we finish this campaign but without the name of our campaign supporters.

  The Impact To be honest, we will try to publish the new Second Edition, Stories of Addy and Anna no matter what. However, without your contribution, we will never go far. 

We believe that the book itself is a good contribution to early childhood education. But the book will be meaningless if nobody knows the existing of it. 

We would love to see children enjoy reading this book (and other books as well) like the old days instead of playing with tablet for hours. 
We like to give an opportunity for parents to spend some good quality time, reading the book to their little ones. 

The book has good values that we like to share with the children.

<p>We, Matt Perry and Betsey Finn, have more fun bird-watching together than we ever could have imagined, and we want to share our passion with you.  In October, 2012, we started recording every new bird species we saw—and took pictures.  Now, seven months later, we have visited over 70 parks, seen 232 species, taken 30,000 pictures, and learned many valuable and inspiring lessons about birds, nature, photography, and ourselves.  When a bird leaves the nest, it “fledges.”  This is our story about the lessons we’ve learned in our “fledge year” as serious birders, richly illustrated with photographs and filled with helpful tips for all beginning bird-watchers.  This book will be valuable as a supplement to traditional bird identification guides, but will also simply be fun to browse or read for anyone who is interested in birds.</p>
<p>You can help us make this book a reality by contributing.  If we reach our goal, we’ll be able to devote the time necessary to combing through the thousands of photographs for the very best ones, writing up the many lessons we’ve learned in the most entertaining and helpful way, and formatting the book through an online publisher. </p>
<p> </p>
<h1>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h1>
<p>We need at least $3000 to afford the time required to write and design Fledge Year and to order the books to give to contributors.  Our birding year ends on October 15, 2013, but we will be doing most of the book design this summer.</p>
<p>If you contribute at least $35, you’ll benefit from some of the knowledge we’ve gained about birding in the Bay Area so far: either an emailable guide to twenty great birding spots in the region, a signed copy of Fledge Year, a private lesson in bird I.D., or a private tour of a great birding location.</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, we will be able to afford enough copies of Fledge Year to give out free copies to anyone who takes one of our tours through Birds and Back Ways, a new service we are starting to more directly share our love of birds and the amazing place we live.  We might also be able to afford a few extra days off for one more bird-watching trip somewhere in California before our year is out.  There are always more birds to see!</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>The Impact</h1>
<p>Your contribution will help us establish ourselves as committed birders in our area.  We will also fill a niche with an accessible and useful guide not just to birding, but to <em>becoming</em> a confident and passionate birder---with a regional focus.</p>
<p>And then there are the birds--they need help, too.  In a world of increasing human population and increasingly unpredictable climate, birds need all the supporters they can get.  Habitat must be preserved, scientific studies need to be funded, and awareness has to be raised about the threats birds face.  This book is our first flight into a life devoted to giving birds the help they need—by inspiring people to notice and protect them.</p>

<h2>L'Esperluche en deux mots</h2>

L'Esperluche est un coussin-peluche à la fois doux et pratique. Cette grosse pièce d'or rembourrée avec amour par les artisans de la dernière manufacture artisanale de peluches française rendra heureux vos enfants, vos amis et même votre grand-père avare !

<h2>Qui sommes nous ?</h2>

Esperia est un serveur Roleplay basé sur le jeu Minecraft. Mais avant tout, nous sommes une communauté de joueurs soudée et ouverte à tous.<br/>
L'ensemble de notre équipe est bénévole et notre serveur est entièrement financé par la générosité de nos membres depuis maintenant plus de deux ans !
<br/><br/>
L'Esperluche est née à l'occasion de la naissance du petit Mathias il y a quelques mois. L'ensemble de ce projet est notre cadeau de bienvenue au premier enfant d'un membre de notre équipe.
<br/><br/>
La peluche a été désignée d'après l'Esper d'or, la monnaie de la ville d'Esperia, un objet que nos membres tiennent particulièrement à cœur (ou à bourse). C'est pour nous l'occasion de rendre à notre communauté tout l'amour et le travail qu'elle nous a gracieusement offert.
<br/><br/>
Vos dons vont nous permettre de concevoir un premier prototype d'Esperluche, puis de passer une commande initiale. Sans vous, rien n'est possible, mais avec votre aide, tout sera possible !

<h2>Ce qu'on demande &amp; Ce qu'on offre</h2>

Le budget du projet est de 800€. Une somme coquette, mais parfaitement justifiée :
<ul>
<li>Dans un premier temps, il nous faut 300€ pour la conception d'un prototype. La création du patron et le design du motif sont des opérations longues et compliquées qui demandent une grande précision pour garantir la qualité du produit final.</li>
<li>Dans un second temps, ils nous faut environ 500€ pour effectuer la commande initiale. Le fabricant devant rentabiliser les frais de production de l'objet, une commande initiale d'au moins 50 pièces est demandée.</li>
</ul><br/>
Pour seulement 1€, vous aurez le droit à un titre honorifique affiché sous votre avatar sur le forum d'Esperia. Ne manquez pas cette chance unique !
Donnez un peu plus, et vous recevrez de magnifiques badges Esperia pour orner vos vêtements et vos sacs.<br/>
Si vous donnez assez, nous vous offrirons d'écrire un message personnalisé qui sera ajouté aux splashs du menu principal d'Esperia. (Notez que nous gardons le droit de refuser tout texte inapproprié).<br/>
Et bien-entendu, pour un don d'au moins 22€, vous recevrez une Esperluche en avant-première ! Nous vous garantissons qu'elle vous sera expédiée dès que nous les recevons !
<br/><br/>
Dans l'éventualité où nous n'atteignons pas le but, votre argent vous sera restitué par Indiegogo.

<h2>Notre Impact</h2>

L'Esperluche n'est pas uniquement une petite perle de design. En participant à ce projet, vous apportez votre soutien à l'artisanat français.
<br/><br/>
La boutique Au Nain Bleu existe depuis près de 100 ans et emploie de nombreux artisans pour fabriquer des peluches d'une très grande qualité. Elle a récemment racheté la dernière fabrique artisanale de peluches en France, et y fait produire l'ensemble de ses peluches. Nous avons choisi de travailler avec eux pour être absolument certains d'avoir la meilleure peluche possible, et aussi pour garder la conscience tranquille. Aucun enfant ne sera exploité lors de la production de l'Esperluche !
<br/><br/>
Tous les éventuels bénéfices que nous pourrions toucher dans le cadre de cette campagne seront utilisés pour maintenir un serveur de qualité à la disposition des membres d'Esperia, ainsi que pour financer d'éventuels projets ultérieurs !

<h2>Votre Soutien !</h2>

N'oubliez pas, même si vous ne pouvez nous aider à financer l'Esperluche, rien ne vous empêche d'en parler à vos amis et vos proches !<br/>
Tweetez, Facebookez, faites du bruit ! Tous le monde a besoin d'une Esperluche !

Vos dons vont nous permettre de concevoir un premier prototype d'Esperluche, puis de passer une commande initiale. Sans vous, rien n'est possible, mais avec votre aide, tout sera possible !

Ce qu'on demande & Ce qu'on offre

Le budget du projet est de 800€. Une somme coquette, mais parfaitement justifiée :

Dans un premier temps, il nous faut 300€ pour la conception d'un prototype. La création du patron et le design du motif sont des opérations longues et compliquées qui demandent une grande précision pour garantir la qualité du produit final.
Dans un second temps, ils nous faut environ 500€ pour effectuer la commande initiale. Le fabricant devant rentabiliser les frais de production de l'objet, une commande initiale d'au moins 50 pièces est demandée.

Pour seulement 1€, vous aurez le droit à un titre honorifique affiché sous votre avatar sur le forum d'Esperia. Ne manquez pas cette chance unique !
Donnez un peu plus, et vous recevrez de magnifiques badges Esperia pour orner vos vêtements et vos sacs.
Si vous donnez assez, nous vous offrirons d'écrire un message personnalisé qui sera ajouté aux splashs du menu principal d'Esperia. (Notez que nous gardons le droit de refuser tout texte inapproprié).
Et bien-entendu, pour un don d'au moins 22€, vous recevrez une Esperluche en avant-première ! Nous vous garantissons qu'elle vous sera expédiée dès que nous les recevons !

Dans l'éventualité où nous n'atteignons pas le but, votre argent vous sera restitué par Indiegogo.

Notre Impact

L'Esperluche n'est pas uniquement une petite perle de design. En participant à ce projet, vous apportez votre soutien à l'artisanat français.

La boutique Au Nain Bleu existe depuis près de 100 ans et emploie de nombreux artisans pour fabriquer des peluches d'une très grande qualité. Elle a récemment racheté la dernière fabrique artisanale de peluches en France, et y fait produire l'ensemble de ses peluches. Nous avons choisi de travailler avec eux pour être absolument certains d'avoir la meilleure peluche possible, et aussi pour garder la conscience tranquille. Aucun enfant ne sera exploité lors de la production de l'Esperluche !

Tous les éventuels bénéfices que nous pourrions toucher dans le cadre de cette campagne seront utilisés pour maintenir un serveur de qualité à la disposition des membres d'Esperia, ainsi que pour financer d'éventuels projets ultérieurs !

Votre Soutien !

N'oubliez pas, même si vous ne pouvez nous aider à financer l'Esperluche, rien ne vous empêche d'en parler à vos amis et vos proches !

AWN is committed to recognizing and celebrating diversity and the many intersectional experiences of Autistic women.  AWN welcomes all women, supporters of women, those who have at one time identified as women and non binary gender variant individuals.  AWN recognizes and affirms the gender identity of each individual.  AWN also welcomes the support and community of those who do not and have not identified as women as allies to support us in our work.

Other Ways You Can Help You may not be able to donate money, but that doesn't mean you can't help: 
Ask folks to get the word out and share our fundraiser on social media and in your network! (Indiegogo has some nifty buttons that let you do that.) Consider submitting your own writing or suggesting autistic people of color who may be interested in submitting!

<p>OK, back to the basics...</p>
<p><b>The Bottom Line</b></p>
<p>Anglican churches are reaching people of every generation and ethnicity with the Gospel. Unfortunately, Anglicanism can be difficult to understand. I've written a practical and personal guide to Anglican worship, theology, and practice. Now, I want to give away as many copies of <i>The Anglican Way</i> as I can.</p>
<p><b>Praise for <i>The Anglican Way</i></b></p>
<p><i>""The Anglican way of worshipping God and following Jesus is beautiful and effective. But some guidance is needed along the first steps. In The Anglican Way, Thomas McKenzie is a reliable and relatable guide. I highly commend Anglican Way to all those who are exploring an Anglican church.""</i></p>
<p><i>--Bishop Todd Hunter, author of ""The Accidental Anglican,"" founder of Churches for the Sake of Others, bishop in the Anglican Church in North America.</i></p>
<p><b>The Anglicans</b></p>
<p>The Anglican Communion is the third largest body of Christians in the world, and the largest Protestant denomination. It’s one of the most active and fruitful fellowships of churches on the planet. In North America, new Anglican congregations are popping up on a weekly basis. Many thousands of people are joining these churches. In the mid-twentieth century, the American version of the Anglican Church was a sleepy country club. Today, it’s part of an unexpected and amazing worldwide movement of God. </p>
<p><b>Anglicans Need A Guidebook</b></p>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.thomasmckenzie.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Thomas McKenzie</span></a>. I’m the pastor of a vibrant Anglican church, <a href=""http://www.redeemernashville.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Church of the Redeemer</a>, in Nashville, Tennesee. The congregation I lead is largely made up of people who were not raised in this tradition. As people join us, they find a beautiful and rich faith, but one that is unfamiliar to most of them. Visitors, newcomers, and members alike often ask me for a guidebook to Anglicanism. Sadly, a thorough and up-to-date introduction to living and worshiping as an Anglican Christian does not exist. That's why I decided to write the book I’ve always wanted to give people.</p>
<p><b>Why Me?</b></p>
<p>I grew up in the Anglican Church, I graduated from one of our seminaries, and I've been an ordained priest since 1998. I have been an active part of several Anglican churches, and I've had contact with hundreds more. Nine years ago I became the founding pastor of the congregation I still serve. </p>
<p>Most of my ministry has been with people who aren't familiar with this tradition. They may like this ""Anglican thing,"" but they don't understand it. They're hungry to know more. Whether over coffee, on the internet, in a church sanctuary, or in a classroom, I've had thousands of hours of practice explaining the Anglican Way. Now I'd like to offer that guidance to others.</p>
<p><b>What I've Done</b></p>
<p>I have written a guidebook called <i>The Anglican Way</i>. It's a practical and personal guide to Anglican Christianity. It addresses the questions I'm often asked, and it gives the reader a context for what this form of Christianity is all about. </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/x7m8wa4g9sv543l/DB90Jmhp20/Samples%20of%20The%20Anglican%20Way.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can read samples from the book by following this link</a>: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/AnglicanWaySample"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://tinyurl.com/AnglicanWaySample</span></a>.</p>
<p><b>What I Propose To Do</b></p>
<p>I’ve decided to make this book available for free whenever possible, at least in digital form. The most important thing to me is that people get a chance to read this book. I want it to be a gift to the Church, a gift you can help me to give. </p>
<p>If the Indiegogo campaign is successful, I’ll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have the manuscript professionally proofed and edited. </li>
<li>Have the book cover professionally designed </li>
<li>Build and maintain a website that will provide free versions of the eBook.</li>
<li>Have both the eBook and physical book laid out for publishing. </li>
<li>Print a run of physical books, with some copies set aside to be given away for free to people who can’t access ebooks. </li>
<li>Let the world know about the book (marketing).</li>
<li>Ship physical books.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Stretch Goals</b></p>
<p>If we meet the basic goal, we'll be able to provide the eBook free to everyone who asks (though we'll have to sell it on websites that won't let us give it away). We'll also print a run of physical copies. If we exceed the basic goal we’ll be able to print more copies of the book, and give more books away. We hope to record a professional audiobook. To encourage the campaign to go past the basic goal, here are our stretch goals:</p>
<p>If we raise $1500 over the basic goal, everyone who contributes at any level will get an ebook called <i>The Harpoonist</i>. That's my new Advent devotional guide, and you'll get it by December 1st, 2013.</p>
<p>If we raise $3000 over the basic goal, we will professionally produce a digital audiobook of <i>The Anglican Way</i>. Everyone who contributed at the $25 Level or above will get a copy of the audiobook. </p>
<p>If we raise $5000 over the basic goal, we will ePublish <i>My Soul in Silence Waits.</i> That's a guide to Lectio Divina, an ancient form of praying with the Bible. Everyone who backed this project at the $25 level or higher will get a copy. This eBook will be available by Christmas 2014.</p>
<p>If we raise $8,000 over the basic goal, we will give away 200 printed copies of <i>The Anglican Way</i> to people who either can't afford the printed book or don't have access to eBooks.  </p>
<p>For every $3000 further ($12,000, $15,000, etc.), we will give away another 200 printed copies of <i>The Anglican Way</i> to people who either can't afford the printed book or don't have access to eBooks.  </p>
<p><b>How Does This Work?</b></p>
<p>You're invited to join this campaign. You can choose from a variety of pledge levels, each with its own incentives. If the campaign is successful, the book will be published and you will get whatever reward(s) you selected. </p>
<p>If we exceed the minimum goal, we’ll be able to do even more (like printing more books, recording an audiobook and giving away more physical copies), and the rewards will increase.</p>
<p>If we don't make our minimum goal, we will still be able to fulfill all the rewards. That's a promise. However, we won't be able to give the eBook away for free. That would be sad.</p>
<p>Whether you join the campaign or not, please share this page with your friends!</p>
<p>I am thrilled to get this book out there. It's been a dream of mine for many years. I'm grateful to anyone who is willing to help. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and may God bless you.</p>

<h2>WANT TO READ SOME ACTUALLY GOOD VAMPIRE EROTICA?</h2>
<p><strong>Well, so do we!</strong></p>
<p>We're Amanda Gannon and Paul Batteiger, a couple of writers,
artists, and fans of genre fiction trying to support ourselves by
providing the masses with entertaining and well-written tales of sex
and violence.  Our work is plot-heavy, character-driven, and
woman-friendly, which is how we say that we try to write stuff that
would not piss us off to read.</p>
<p>Our latest project is <em>Imperial Blood</em>, our 9<sup>th</sup>
Adventurotica novel. It's going to be a dark, erotic story of
vampiric romance that will have NO SPARKLING.  It will run on
our site, <a href=""http://adventurotica.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adventurotica.com</a>,
from November through March, allowing members to read it in
bite-sized installments as it is written, and after that it will be
an ebook and a print edition.  We need to stay afloat while it
runs, though, and that is where you come in.</p>
<p><strong>We need to raise $3,500 to cover some of the cost of
living over the four-month course of the novel. </strong>
Neither of us is employed aside from this, and Amanda is disabled due
to bipolar depression.  We need food, we need to keep our home,
and we need medical care that, frankly, we aren't getting.</p>
<p>This won't cover us completely, but it's a great start, and it's a
goal we think we can make if we get help from people like you: people
who support independent publishing and who care about enabling
creative folks to support themselves doing what they love best.</p>
<p>In exchange, we're offering site memberships, print and ebook
copies of the finished novel, and really neat stuff like walk-on
roles and sexy bonus scenes tailored to fit your tastes. Your
contribution will help us pay the bills and stay in our home and buy
medication.  It will literally make us healthier and happier. 
Further, we think it will make the genre of erotica a better, sexier
place.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more, read on!</p>
<h2>WHAT IS THIS BOOK ABOUT?</h2>
<p><em>Imperial Blood</em> is a bit of a departure from our usual
tales of derring-do and pornified sex.  It is going to be a kind
of dark fable, intentionally taking all the tropes of the Gothic
Romance and turning them inside out while still maintaining the feel
and atmosphere.  It's going to be serious, kink-heavy, and
fantastical.  The essential, central idea was ""A Beauty and
the Beast story where Beauty becomes the Beast.""  It's also
a fun chance to p*ss all over <i>Twilight</i> and <i>50 Shades of
Grey</i>.  It will feature male-dom and fem-dom BDSM, and while
most of it will be het, girls will get it on with girls and guys will
get it on with guys.  Something for everyone, as long as you're
kind of a perv.</p>
<h3>What's the story?</h3>
<p>From his dark palace at the northernmost part of the world, the
dread Emperor Acrisius rules over his vast empire.  Once every
hundred years, he sends for a girl of royal lineage to be brought to
his court.  None are ever seen again.</p>
<p>When Sibylla is called, she must go, not knowing what will become
of her.  She fears the summons will mean her death, but she
finds herself entangled in the ancient, complex life of the Dark
Lord: a man who lives on blood, destroys all he touches, and yearns
for a lost love he can never regain.  He will seek to make her
his in more ways than she can imagine, and if she is to remain
herself, she must resist.</p>
<p>Garath, the young knight who loves her, dares everything to follow
her into the north, willing to brave darkness, cold, and terror to
save her.  He falls into the hands of Minaraja, the Emperor's
first bride, a creature of deathless cruelty and unending spite.
Roused to hunger by his youth and beauty, she seeks to break his
spirit with pleasure and terror.</p>
<p>Sibylla and Garath must find their own way through this dark place
of intrigue, passion, and death unending.</p>
<p>This will be an explicit book, suitable for adults only. 
There will be straight sex and gay sex, and will feature a lot of
decadent, evil kinkiness and bondage -- up to and including
blood-play.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?</h2>
<p>We're authors published across various genres.  Paul has had
pirate fiction (of the non-erotica variety) published in the superb
anthology <em>Fast Ships, Black Sails</em>, edited by Ann and Jeff
VanderMeer and published by Night Shade Books in 2008.  Amanda's
stories have appeared in <em>The Mammoth Book of Best New Erotica</em>
twice, in volumes 4 and 6, and both of them contributed stories to
<em>Beauty Has Her Way</em>, a fantastic anthology of stories about
strong, driven, dangerous women edited by Jennifer Brozek and
published by Dark Quest Books in 2011.</p>
<p>Paul will be taking the authorial reins on this project. Amanda
will be editing and constructing the artsy perks. She will also be
handling some of the sex scenes and bonus scenes, and making sure the
overall hotness level is up to par. She's also the kinky stuff
fact-checker.</p>
<p>We live in Oklahoma, a poor state with very few resources for
poor, mentally ill people with chronic health conditions, and who
cannot work outside the home due to these limitations.  We're
trying to do the best we can with what we have.  We just don't
have much.  This will be our 9th novel for Adventurotica since
November of 2010 - so you can be sure the book will be written.</p>
<p>When you support us, you're helping us make the money we need to
live.  It really is that simple.</p>
<h2>WHAT WE NEED!</h2>
<p><strong>Money.</strong> (No point in beating around the bush.)</p>
<p>Here is how we will spend it:</p>
<p><strong>Materials for the incentives.</strong>  The hard copy
books will cost around $15 to print and ship (domestically). 
Shipping for other perks gets pricier all the time.  Optional
licensing for new fonts (we'd really like some) and any necessary
stock photos is around $70.</p>
<p><strong>Living expenses.</strong> Food, bills, and a roof to turn
away the life-leeching rays of the blazing hatestar – sorry, <em>the
sun</em>. We have this annoying hierarchy of needs thing going on.
<em>Damn you, Maslow!</em></p>
<p><strong>Medical care.</strong>  We won't burden you with
details, but Amanda in particular cannot get some of the medication
and treatment she needs through the low-cost clinic and pharmacy she
currently attends.</p>
<p>And there you have it. Most of it is going towards keeping us
alive and healthy and relatively mentally stable. Is that exciting?
No! But we have to stay alive to write smut. Contrary to what you
might think, disease-ridden, lunatic zombies don't write very
interesting sex scenes. It's just a lot of moaning and cannibalism.</p>

<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>How about a gruesome literary death?</strong>  Want

Drowned?  Eaten by sharks?  Whatever your preferred end, we

<p><strong>How about a bonus scene? </strong>Frustrated by how your

that. It doesn't even have to be canon, and we are extremely
open-minded about content. We don't judge. Unless that's your thing.

<p>It'll go into the print book, even, but unless you ask us to –

<h2>WHAT HAPPENS</h2>
<p>We post the book serially on our site. This will be our 9<sup>th</sup>
novel, and we've never failed to post three serial updates a week. We
are reliable. The story <em>will</em> be finished on time. It is
projected to run around 45-50 chapters, and should be between 140,000

</li>
<li>
<p>Print books will be released as
	close to the the ebook as possible, but it takes longer to do, so
	there will be a lag.</p>

<h2>THE IMPACT</h2>
<p>This is the part where we're supposed to explain how our project
is valuable to you and to the world. No pressure. Look, we'd love to
claim that our project will bring about world peace by making sure
nobody has a hand free to pull a trigger, but that seems unlikely.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What we can do is make
	people happy.</strong> Have a good time. Bring something that is
	unreservedly fun into the world, just because it belongs here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Erotica is an important
	genre, and we want to make it a better, more entertaining place.</strong>
	Bottom line, people often complain, with good reason, that good
	erotica is difficult to find. That most of it is poorly-written.
	That the characters are flat. That the sex is boring. That it
	doesn't tell an interesting story.  That it's horribly sexist
	and gross.  Well, all that is changing at lightning speed, and
	we want to be a part of that.  We've just found that we're
	happier working for ourselves than for other people, as much as we
	love those other people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>We want to give readers
	entertainment for adults</strong><strong>, not just adult
	entertainment.</strong> There is a dire shortage of well-written,
	fast-paced, plot-heavy long-form erotica. We want to write a book
	that provides you, the reader, with a well-told adventure story that
	doesn't fade to black just when things are getting good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>We want to encourage
	independent erotica publishing by being part of it.</strong> By
	publishing independently, we are freeing ourselves from the
	restrictions placed on authors by publishers; restrictions on
	content, on length, on ratio of plot to sex.  We aren't
	breaking rules. We're stepping outside of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>We want to keep on keepin' on.</strong>  This is
	the important one to us. If you think about how much you enjoy
	eating, drinking, and being merry, as well as how nice it is if you
	have a home and access to basic medical care, it should need no
	explanation. It means<em> the world</em> to us.</p>
</li>

<br/><p></p></span></div>","WANT TO READ SOME ACTUALLY GOOD VAMPIRE EROTICA?
Well, so do we!
We're Amanda Gannon and Paul Batteiger, a couple of writers,
artists, and fans of genre fiction trying to support ourselves by
providing the masses with entertaining and well-written tales of sex
and violence.  Our work is plot-heavy, character-driven, and
woman-friendly, which is how we say that we try to write stuff that
would not piss us off to read.
Our latest project is Imperial Blood, our 9th
Adventurotica novel. It's going to be a dark, erotic story of
vampiric romance that will have NO SPARKLING.  It will run on
our site, Adventurotica.com,
from November through March, allowing members to read it in
bite-sized installments as it is written, and after that it will be
an ebook and a print edition.  We need to stay afloat while it
runs, though, and that is where you come in.
We need to raise $3,500 to cover some of the cost of
living over the four-month course of the novel. 
Neither of us is employed aside from this, and Amanda is disabled due
to bipolar depression.  We need food, we need to keep our home,
and we need medical care that, frankly, we aren't getting.
This won't cover us completely, but it's a great start, and it's a
goal we think we can make if we get help from people like you: people
who support independent publishing and who care about enabling
creative folks to support themselves doing what they love best.
In exchange, we're offering site memberships, print and ebook
copies of the finished novel, and really neat stuff like walk-on
roles and sexy bonus scenes tailored to fit your tastes. Your
contribution will help us pay the bills and stay in our home and buy
medication.  It will literally make us healthier and happier. 
Further, we think it will make the genre of erotica a better, sexier
place.
If you want to learn more, read on!
WHAT IS THIS BOOK ABOUT?
Imperial Blood is a bit of a departure from our usual
tales of derring-do and pornified sex.  It is going to be a kind
of dark fable, intentionally taking all the tropes of the Gothic
Romance and turning them inside out while still maintaining the feel
and atmosphere.  It's going to be serious, kink-heavy, and
fantastical.  The essential, central idea was ""A Beauty and
the Beast story where Beauty becomes the Beast.""  It's also
a fun chance to p*ss all over Twilight and 50 Shades of
Grey.  It will feature male-dom and fem-dom BDSM, and while
most of it will be het, girls will get it on with girls and guys will
get it on with guys.  Something for everyone, as long as you're
kind of a perv.
What's the story?
From his dark palace at the northernmost part of the world, the
dread Emperor Acrisius rules over his vast empire.  Once every
hundred years, he sends for a girl of royal lineage to be brought to
his court.  None are ever seen again.
When Sibylla is called, she must go, not knowing what will become
of her.  She fears the summons will mean her death, but she
finds herself entangled in the ancient, complex life of the Dark
Lord: a man who lives on blood, destroys all he touches, and yearns
for a lost love he can never regain.  He will seek to make her
his in more ways than she can imagine, and if she is to remain
herself, she must resist.
Garath, the young knight who loves her, dares everything to follow
her into the north, willing to brave darkness, cold, and terror to
save her.  He falls into the hands of Minaraja, the Emperor's
first bride, a creature of deathless cruelty and unending spite.
Roused to hunger by his youth and beauty, she seeks to break his
spirit with pleasure and terror.
Sibylla and Garath must find their own way through this dark place
of intrigue, passion, and death unending.
This will be an explicit book, suitable for adults only. 
There will be straight sex and gay sex, and will feature a lot of
decadent, evil kinkiness and bondage -- up to and including
blood-play.

WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?
We're authors published across various genres.  Paul has had
pirate fiction (of the non-erotica variety) published in the superb
anthology Fast Ships, Black Sails, edited by Ann and Jeff
VanderMeer and published by Night Shade Books in 2008.  Amanda's
stories have appeared in The Mammoth Book of Best New Erotica
twice, in volumes 4 and 6, and both of them contributed stories to
Beauty Has Her Way, a fantastic anthology of stories about
strong, driven, dangerous women edited by Jennifer Brozek and
published by Dark Quest Books in 2011.
Paul will be taking the authorial reins on this project. Amanda
will be editing and constructing the artsy perks. She will also be
handling some of the sex scenes and bonus scenes, and making sure the
overall hotness level is up to par. She's also the kinky stuff
fact-checker.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>Hello, my name is Haki Madhubuti. I am the founder and publisher of Third World Press, America’s oldest independent publisher devoted to works for, by, and concerning African Americans and others.<p><br/>We are very grateful that Malcolm’s children have granted us the opportunity to publish <i>The Diary</i>; it is the most important volume we have ever brought to the public, after more than 46 years in publishing.</p>
<p><br/>I am presenting this information to you because we need your help to do this in the manner that honors and respects the importance of Malcolm. While we have been the leading publisher of great works of many renowned authors including Gwendolyn Brooks, Chancellor Williams, Sonia Sanchez, Amiri Baraka, Barbara Ann Sizemore and many others, we have never sought commercial blockbusters. Our books were largely focused on smaller, often academic markets.</p>
<p><br/>While we have published hundreds of important works over 46 years, the recent recession and changes in the publishing industry have taken their financial toll on TWP. While many independent publishers have simply disappeared, the devoted staff and supporters of Third World Press have done whatever it takes to survive. Through their hard work and financial support we have remade the Press, and are on the brink of a new and brighter future. We have a strong new distributor relationship, having partnered with one of the world’s largest distributors and printer of books. We are converting much of our inventory so that we can meet the demands of the ebook customer, and we have assembled a great new lineup of books for publication in the next few months.</p>
<p><br/>The first and most important of these is <i>The Diary of Malcolm X</i>, which will be released in November 2013. This exciting document was edited and annotated by author and journalist Herb Boyd in collaboration with Malcolm’s and Betty’s third eldest daughter, Ilyasah Al-Shabazz.</p>
<p><br/>In it we see the deep reflections of this transformative figure as he developed a new vision for the elevation and integration of the African Diaspora in the context of the world changing events that are having so great an impact on today’s headlines, both in the United States and throughout the world.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p></p>We need your help because a book of this importance needs to be supported with an appropriate campaign of public relations and marketing. These costs far exceed our resources. Even the costs incurred to date, and the costs of initial printing, are beyond our financial capacity without your help.<br/><br/>Thankfully, we believe that you will be there to allow us to make this undertaking a great success; to help us to let the world at large know of the opportunity to become reacquainted with Malcolm X in a manner that is more personal than any previous encounter. We believe we can count on you to help make this a best seller.<br/><br/>We believe that you, our supporters, deserve to be the recipients of meaningful rewards for your participation in this campaign and we welcome you as old friends and new to the family of the Third World Press.<br/><br/>As a token of our gratitude, we have taken the time to put together some perks in exchange for your support:<br/><br/><ul>

His words and actions have moved nations and peoples.<br/><br/>In coming weeks, the world will see, <i>The Diary of Malcolm X</i>, printed contents of his private diary from the year 1964. This Diary, recorded by Malcolm during the year immediately preceding his assassination, describes his travels to many nations, and meetings with numerous world leaders. In these pages, Malcolm describes the deep emotional connections he developed during a period that was constantly colored by his prophetic sense of impending tragedy. Recovered recently from the memorabilia maintained by the family, he lays out his unique action plan for African Americans.<br/><br/>“<i>The publication of </i>The Diary of Malcolm X<i> is a great historical event in African American intellectual history. Reading these entries has the effect of overhearing a profound thinker’s most private and uncensored thoughts about everything from his split with Elijah Muhammad to the cost of 16mm film in Accra. I found this a riveting and deeply moving experience, one that only made me even sadder at the senselessness of his assassination. Every student of Malcolm X, and the history of black political leadership, should read this compelling book.</i>”<br/>—<b>Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</b><br/>Director, The Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research<br/>Harvard University<br/><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

I am presenting this information to you because we need your help to do this in the manner that honors and respects the importance of Malcolm. While we have been the leading publisher of great works of many renowned authors including Gwendolyn Brooks, Chancellor Williams, Sonia Sanchez, Amiri Baraka, Barbara Ann Sizemore and many others, we have never sought commercial blockbusters. Our books were largely focused on smaller, often academic markets.
While we have published hundreds of important works over 46 years, the recent recession and changes in the publishing industry have taken their financial toll on TWP. While many independent publishers have simply disappeared, the devoted staff and supporters of Third World Press have done whatever it takes to survive. Through their hard work and financial support we have remade the Press, and are on the brink of a new and brighter future. We have a strong new distributor relationship, having partnered with one of the world’s largest distributors and printer of books. We are converting much of our inventory so that we can meet the demands of the ebook customer, and we have assembled a great new lineup of books for publication in the next few months.
The first and most important of these is The Diary of Malcolm X, which will be released in November 2013. This exciting document was edited and annotated by author and journalist Herb Boyd in collaboration with Malcolm’s and Betty’s third eldest daughter, Ilyasah Al-Shabazz.
In it we see the deep reflections of this transformative figure as he developed a new vision for the elevation and integration of the African Diaspora in the context of the world changing events that are having so great an impact on today’s headlines, both in the United States and throughout the world.
What We Need & What You Get


We need your help because a book of this importance needs to be supported with an appropriate campaign of public relations and marketing. These costs far exceed our resources. Even the costs incurred to date, and the costs of initial printing, are beyond our financial capacity without your help.Thankfully, we believe that you will be there to allow us to make this undertaking a great success; to help us to let the world at large know of the opportunity to become reacquainted with Malcolm X in a manner that is more personal than any previous encounter. We believe we can count on you to help make this a best seller.We believe that you, our supporters, deserve to be the recipients of meaningful rewards for your participation in this campaign and we welcome you as old friends and new to the family of the Third World Press.As a token of our gratitude, we have taken the time to put together some perks in exchange for your support:

The Impact
Malcolm X was one of the most important contributors to the advancement of human rights and human dignity in the last century. His words and actions have moved nations and peoples.In coming weeks, the world will see, The Diary of Malcolm X, printed contents of his private diary from the year 1964. This Diary, recorded by Malcolm during the year immediately preceding his assassination, describes his travels to many nations, and meetings with numerous world leaders. In these pages, Malcolm describes the deep emotional connections he developed during a period that was constantly colored by his prophetic sense of impending tragedy. Recovered recently from the memorabilia maintained by the family, he lays out his unique action plan for African Americans.“The publication of The Diary of Malcolm X is a great historical event in African American intellectual history. Reading these entries has the effect of overhearing a profound thinker’s most private and uncensored thoughts about everything from his split with Elijah Muhammad to the cost of 16mm film in Accra. I found this a riveting and deeply moving experience, one that only made me even sadder at the senselessness of his assassination. Every student of Malcolm X, and the history of black political leadership, should read this compelling book.”—Henry Louis Gates, Jr.Director, The Du Bois Institute for African and African American ResearchHarvard UniversityOther Ways You Can Help

<p><b>Sounds Like Texas: Anti-Oppressive Resistance in
Southern Music Communities</b></p>
<p>Texas cities consistently rank among the
fastest-growing in the United States. This growth has brought new problems
associated with gentrification while exacerbating traditional forms of
segregation. Three performers and activists working in Texas' urban popular music
scenes share insights into shifting politics of identity and resistance.
Perspectives from queer hip-hop in Houston, Austin's Middle Eastern music
fusion scene, and drag king country explore how small music communities not
only resist multiple layers of oppression, but thrive in the often-volatile
political climate of Southern cities. This panel theorizes the
counter-hegemonic potential of popular musics in Texas, identifying how
musicians use the state's political contradictions to their advantage to effect
social change.</p>

<p><b><span>Existence Is Resistance: Politics of
Authenticity in Austin’s Middle Eastern Fusion Scene</span></b></p>
<p>J. Brian Griffith, Texas Folklife</p>
<p>Austin’s Middle Eastern music fusion scene
exists in a world of contradictions. The scene’s vitality and sustainability
seem to contradict the harsh conditions under which it thrives: systemic
racism, increasing anti-immigrant rhetoric, and rampant gentrification that
threatens its musicians both as artists and as people of color. Musicians thus
constantly struggle to make a living playing music to a gentrified Texas
audience while simultaneously communicating their cultural and political
messages to this audience. This is accomplished with a politics of anti-politics.
Palestinian artists have often told me that existence is resistance - the
performance of a traditional musical piece when that tradition is pressured to
assimilate or die is, in itself, a political act. For Middle Eastern bands in
Austin, that political act requires situating their performances between the
cultural logics of the popular music industry and the folkloric music world.
They have to be equally comfortable playing at a bar downtown or at a cultural
center associated with universities or institutions. The blurring of two
presentation styles, popular and folkloric, defies easy categorization, which
forces audience members to be more aware and mindful of what they are
experiencing. In addition to analyzing live performances and interviews, I will
use footage from my upcoming collaborative documentary with these musicians, <i>1,001 Austin Nights</i>, to examine the
strengths and limitations of the “politics of anti-politics” approach to
cultural performance.</p>

<h3>Mike Reynolds<br/>
</h3>
<p>A Savoyard by name and by nature, I have been studying, writing about, performing in and directing the works of Gilbert and Sullivan for many years.  I hold an MFA in Operatic Directing from The Catholic University of America and a BA in Theatre from Loyola University of Chicago.   A professor of Media Studies at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut, my previous publications include ""The New Girl"", ""Reaching 'Out'"", and ""Fear thy Neighbor"".  <br/></p>
<p>It has long been a goal of mine to provide a collection of brief, punchy, easy-to-read and enjoyable articles for fellow devotees of the works of this often tempestuous duo whose 14 operas compose an important  basis for all American Musical Theater.   ""Modified Rapture!"" will be an enjoyable guide to the 14 Savoy operas, offering insights into the creation of them, (AKA - all the relationship gossip), their various key productions in Britain and the US, (AKA - the backstage dirt), and the precedents each opera has set for later work, (AKA - the serious, scholarly stuff).  It will provide fun and insight for fans of Gilbert and Sullivan and serve as a valuable production source book for theater companies and G&amp;S societies nationwide. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking for a total of $3,500.00 to offset my research, publishing writing and marketing expenses.  Most of this money will finance my research into landmark productions of the operas in the United States.  There is an online treasure trove of D'Oyly Carte production information, as well as excellent primary and secondary source materials on the way in which Gilbert and Sullivan worked together during the course of their career together.  My challenge is in the US, examining the innovations of G&amp;S production here.</p>
<p>The book will be published as a POD in both print and Kindle formats.  $1,000 will be used for advertising &amp; promotion among theatre companies and Gilbert and Sullivan Societies. </p>
<p>The perks for supporters are listed alongside, and I'm sure you'll find them at least as amusing as the final book.<br/></p>
<p>This is a flex funding project, so all proceeds above my cost short of the goal will be donated to the Connecticut G&amp;S Society, a group dedicated to preserving as nearly as possible, Gilbert's original staging and Sullivan's original orchestrations.<br/></p>
<br/><h3>Gilbert &amp; Sullivan?</h3>
<p>Aficionados of Gilbert and Sullivan are a relatively small group of people when compared to other fan groups, (like., say, Justin Bieberheads).  Yet, although they no longer have a simmilar muti-billion-dollar global publicity machine behind them, they are a united, dedicated, and highly passionate group who really live and breathe the wit &amp; wisdom of Gilbert's words and the uplifting lilt of Sullivan's immortal melodies.  They are a group of devoted Victorianists, Steampunkers, English Teachers, Romantics, and Anglophiles who I firmly believe will support this campaign and this book.<br/></p>

It has long been a goal of mine to provide a collection of brief, punchy, easy-to-read and enjoyable articles for fellow devotees of the works of this often tempestuous duo whose 14 operas compose an important  basis for all American Musical Theater.   ""Modified Rapture!"" will be an enjoyable guide to the 14 Savoy operas, offering insights into the creation of them, (AKA - all the relationship gossip), their various key productions in Britain and the US, (AKA - the backstage dirt), and the precedents each opera has set for later work, (AKA - the serious, scholarly stuff).  It will provide fun and insight for fans of Gilbert and Sullivan and serve as a valuable production source book for theater companies and G&S societies nationwide. 



What I Need & What You Get
I'm looking for a total of $3,500.00 to offset my research, publishing writing and marketing expenses.  Most of this money will finance my research into landmark productions of the operas in the United States.  There is an online treasure trove of D'Oyly Carte production information, as well as excellent primary and secondary source materials on the way in which Gilbert and Sullivan worked together during the course of their career together.  My challenge is in the US, examining the innovations of G&S production here.
The book will be published as a POD in both print and Kindle formats.  $1,000 will be used for advertising & promotion among theatre companies and Gilbert and Sullivan Societies. 
The perks for supporters are listed alongside, and I'm sure you'll find them at least as amusing as the final book.
This is a flex funding project, so all proceeds above my cost short of the goal will be donated to the Connecticut G&S Society, a group dedicated to preserving as nearly as possible, Gilbert's original staging and Sullivan's original orchestrations.
Gilbert & Sullivan?
Aficionados of Gilbert and Sullivan are a relatively small group of people when compared to other fan groups, (like., say, Justin Bieberheads).  Yet, although they no longer have a simmilar muti-billion-dollar global publicity machine behind them, they are a united, dedicated, and highly passionate group who really live and breathe the wit & wisdom of Gilbert's words and the uplifting lilt of Sullivan's immortal melodies.  They are a group of devoted Victorianists, Steampunkers, English Teachers, Romantics, and Anglophiles who I firmly believe will support this campaign and this book.



How You Can Help
I can't do this without your help. I simply can't afford to fund the book myself. So to be blunt about it, I need your money, . My estimated 
budget is $3,500, which will cover my travel and research expenses, as well as offset my expenses as I write and publish and market this piece.
But I also want your involvement in the form of your expertise, and 
your advice! If you can put 
me in touch with people I can talk to, people whose present day productions of G&S have brought you a fresh enjoyment of these great works of theatre, I'd love it.
And of course, you can help spread the word! Post this to your 
Facebook, tweet about it, share it on Google+, tell your friends and 
family about it. Together we can make this happen.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p align=""justify"">On the fringes of a civil war arise a kaleidoscope of stories. 
  Stories of abuse, power, betrayal, sex, love, and absolution; all united by 
  the failings of a dying government. Set in the backdrop during the last years 
  of South Africa's apartheid, <i>How the Water Falls</i> is fictional story that 
  unfolds the truth and deception of the systems victims, perpetrators, and unlikely 
  heroes. The two main characters, one white, Joanne- a reporter, the other black, 
  Lena- a banned activist, have their lives continuously overlap through the people 
  they know during a thirteen year period.  This novel is as complex as apartheid 
  had been itself, unlacing fabrics of each character’s life to merge into a catalyst 
  downfall. The question of who will survive this downfall will suffice 
  in the courts of truth and reconciliation, and whether love is strong enough 
  to preserve peace.</p><p align=""justify""></p><p> </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZoYyAO_t3Y"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p></p>

<p>Take
a moment to imagine the Texas you’d like to live in twenty years from now. In
this vision, are the rivers stagnant? Boat docks abandoned? Swimming holes
dried up? </p>
<p>If
you said no, you’re probably not alone. And yet that is exactly the future we
as a state say we aspire to, through a democratic process that few Texans know
or understand. </p>
<p>In
legalese, this is called <i>Desired Future
Conditions</i>, and it spells out how much groundwater we can pump from our
aquifers between now and 2060. The only problem is, the Desired Future
Conditions we’re adopting in most places allow us to pump so much groundwater,
there won’t be any left for springs. And since most of Texas' rivers--from the Rio
Grande in the west to the Guadalupe in the east--get most of their baseflow
from springs fed by groundwater, this also means there won’t be much left in
our rivers. </p>
<p>I
think the future Texans <i>actually</i>
desire looks a lot different than the one we’re creating with every new well we
drill. And my goal is to help Texans see why they need to transform their water policies
to build the future they really want.</p>
<p>That’s why I—Sharlene Leurig, a writer and
national water advocate—am joining forces with photographer Sarah Wilson, radio producer Dennis Foley and the Texas Center for Policy Studies to create <i>Our

<p></p></div>","The Project
Take
a moment to imagine the Texas you’d like to live in twenty years from now. In
this vision, are the rivers stagnant? Boat docks abandoned? Swimming holes
dried up? 
If
you said no, you’re probably not alone. And yet that is exactly the future we
as a state say we aspire to, through a democratic process that few Texans know
or understand. 
In
legalese, this is called Desired Future
Conditions, and it spells out how much groundwater we can pump from our
aquifers between now and 2060. The only problem is, the Desired Future
Conditions we’re adopting in most places allow us to pump so much groundwater,
there won’t be any left for springs. And since most of Texas' rivers--from the Rio
Grande in the west to the Guadalupe in the east--get most of their baseflow
from springs fed by groundwater, this also means there won’t be much left in
our rivers. 
I
think the future Texans actually
desire looks a lot different than the one we’re creating with every new well we
drill. And my goal is to help Texans see why they need to transform their water policies
to build the future they really want.
That’s why I—Sharlene Leurig, a writer and
national water advocate—am joining forces with photographer Sarah Wilson, radio producer Dennis Foley and the Texas Center for Policy Studies to create Our
Desired Future: Inspiring Texans to Keep Water Flowing for Future Generations.

Santa Elena Canyon, Sarah WilsonOur Desired Future is inspired by:
1. A belief that Texas can grow prosperously while preserving the
flowing rivers and streams that make this state a treasure
2. A recognition that protecting these resources will take transformative
changes in the way we manage and govern water
3. A vision of Texans coming
together to define a new paradigm for water management
Over the coming months, we’ll be traveling the state, visiting five key regions that, taken together, tell a statewide story of the shortcomings of our current water laws and the need for transformation:The Hill Country The land of 1100 springs and one of America’s fastest-growing regionsCanadian River A Panhandle oasis fighting for life at the end of irrigated agricultureGulf Coast The economic powerhouse of Texas, whose refineries run on someone else's groundwaterRio Grande Where water is the next big cash cropPermian Basin Oil booms and water bustsSalt Flats, Sarah Wilson
We won't just be telling stories about the risks to our water--we'll be telling stories about the solutions being implemented by determined Texans who want to keep water flowing for future generations. Our stories will be beautiful, balanced, and freely available to all. All of the content we create will live on our website www.ourdesiredfuture.com. We'll also make our essays, photography, and audio stories available to anyone who asks for them, for use in regional education and outreach. In addition, we'll market the compilation of audio stories through Texas Public Radio, bringing these stories to rural and urban Texans alike. By spreading these stories far and wide, we can redefine the way Texans view water: from what is mine, and what is yours, to what is ours.
What We Need & What You GetWe've set a fundraising goal of $15,000. Meeting that goal will fund:
Travel expenses for the team to collect stories from Texans across the state
Sarah Wilson's portrait series of Texans and their water 
An audio series by Dennis Foley, telling the story of the shared destiny of Texans dependent on the same water
Donors will receive:$1 or more – Sneak previews of the portrait series before it goes public.$15 or more – Sneak previews and our Top 5 list of the best swimming springs in Texas.$100 or more – Sneak previews and an invitation to meet the Producer and fellow contributors at a special spring in Central Texas.$150 or more – Sneak previews and an 8"" x  10"" print of Big Bend's Castolon, signed by Sarah Wilson. $500 or more – Sneak previews, a signed 11"" x  14"" print of any of the photos featured here, and recognition as a sponsor of Our Desired Future.$1,000 or more – Sneak previews, a signed & framed 16"" x  20"" print of any of the photos featured here, recognition as a lead sponsor of Our Desired Future and invitations to any receptions hosted in support of the release of Our Desired Future.$5,000 or more – Recognition as a signature sponsor of Our Desired Future and a commissioned portrait by Sarah Wilson in any Texas location.Any funds we receive in excess of our goal allow us to hire a web developer for the interactive website that will make our story series freely accessible to Texans across the state.With the generous support of the Texas Center for Policy Studies, a registered 501(c)3 organization, all contributions to Our Desired Future are tax deductible.Castolon, Sarah WilsonThe TeamSharlene Leurig, ProducerA writer and advocate, Sharlene Leurig serves as Director of the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Program at Ceres, a national nonprofit working to advance the integration of sustainability into the global financial markets.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Slam-poet, Jonni O'Gorman, (aka Guapo McDonagh) is a native of Limerick, now living in Spanish Point. Inspired by the great poets of the Cuban Revolution he sees poetry as a necessary weapon with which to question, comment on, and struggle against the shackles of capitalist totalitarianism and monetary asphyxiation. His poetry is considered both well-written and entertaining and he performs regularly in venues throughout Ireland and the UK.</p>
<p>This campaign aims to raise funds to print 200 copies of the book</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need €500 to print 200 copies including the cost of diesel to pick them up.</p>
<p>Doners/backers ontributing €9 or more will receive a copy of the book. Postage is free to anywhere in the world. All doners will be listed on my website <a href=""http://jogideas.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://jogideas.com</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>During the Celtic Tiger there was a lot of money floating about in Ireland. I come frm a poor but hard wotrking background. Anything we ever had was earned through hard work. When I saw the impact all this free money was having on the mentality of people around me I decided I needed to take a stand. I know that nothing ever comes fro free and the property-price boom would eventually end in tears for many people. I wanted to open peoples eyes to this and I found inspiration through poetry and a microphone.</p>
<p>Now a few yeas have passed (and a few babies have been born) since this peotry was first written down and recorded. Many people have heard me in performance in venues all over Irealdn and even in the UK but this is my first attempt at reaching an even wider audience through print media and the Internet. This poetry is important because of how and why it was written. I assumed the character of a homeless traveller/poet with a microphone in one hand an a small camera in the other. Now that I am putting this material out there newe material is forming. I have a album project under way which will hopefully be completed in the first half of this year. I am a revolutionary and my pen is my sword. I believe in standing up for the values and ethics that 99% of the population aspire to. I am a fighter and a lover. By supporting this project you will give the innspiration to keep going, pushing myself to even higher planes. Eventually the world will hear the message</p>

<p>A man with different shades and talents, Gurdeep Khera, my father started his journey of life on Dec 9, 1955. A childhood filled with frequent visits to the boarding schools and limited parental attention, he survived his adolescence with the sheer motivation of doing something worthwhile with his LIFE.</p>
<p>After finishing college from the intellectual city of Kolkata, India, he started managing a family business of selling toys at the Retail showroom. Married off at the age of 21, my father was pushed into financial and domestic responsibilities at a very early age.</p>
<p>After the death of my grandparents, my father dabbled in different professions and industries to make ends meet. He managed a printing press, a catering business, apparel and merchandizing business, opened a restaurant, managed IT infrastructure projects and even modeled for various TV commercials. The only thought that kept him going was to “Never Give up”!</p>
<p><strong>The Year 2005</strong></p>
<p>The summer of 2005 brought extreme heat and bad news for my father. He was diagnosed with a tumor in his bile duct and had to undergo a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Whipple’s procedure</a> at the Ganaga Ram hospital in New Delhi. Part of his pancreas was removed in order to prevent the tumor from spreading to other parts of the stomach.</p>
<p>After being on medication and dietary supplements for almost 2 years, my father got back into the working mode and started employment in 2008. The next four years were a struggle for survival and again what kept him going was the need to “keep moving” and “never give up”!</p>
<p><strong>The morning of April 15, 2013</strong>, my father Gurdeep Khera, went into medical emergency and fell completely unconscious. We rushed him to the hospital and discovered he had a major bleeding in his brain. The blood was spreading through his veins and the doctors had to do an immediate subdural hematoma surgery!</p>
<p><strong>Subdural hematoma</strong> - A burr hole for subdural hematoma is performed to remove a hemorrhage (blood clot) from around the surface of the brain.  The location of the blood clot is beneath the firm covering of the brain known as the dura mater, and is therefore called subdural hematoma. General Risks include such general difficulties, such as bleeding, infection, stroke, paralysis, coma and death.  Incisions on the low back generally heal well, but if could   be tender, or may heal in an unpleasant manner.  There is also the possibility that the surgery may not relieve the symptoms for which the procedure was performed.  The problem for which the surgery was performed may recur, requiring additional surgery in the future.  In addition, although every attempt is made to protect all areas of the body from pressure on nerves, skin and bones, injuries to these areas can occur, particularly with prolonged cases.</p>
<p>Such bleedings could occur due to trauma, injury, hyper tension and continues anxiety!</p>
<p>My father has undergone this surgery and is currently in the ICU (intensive care unit) at a hospital in Navi Mumbai, India, trying to fight all odds and be positive! My mother is by his side and is emotionally supporting him to keep his motivations high.</p>
<p>We make a humble request to all who READ this to help our family come out of this sudden emotional, physical and financial crises.</p>
<p>We are planning to raise approximately $7000 for his surgery and treatment. Any form of monetary contribution would be of great HELP!</p>

</div><h3>¿Qué?</h3><b>69 días </b>es una novela acerca de la redención, de la búsqueda de esta, y de cómo en ocasiones el destino nos depara las mayores sorpresas.<br/><blockquote>
<p><i>Una gitanilla, desgarbada, menuda y
vivaracha, de edad indefinida, extraña, con apariencia de no haber roto en su
vida un solo pensamiento, toma del brazo a una bella mujer en plena calle después
de cruzarse con ella, le mira a los ojos y le lee su temblorosa mano, le
siembra un destino invariable en el tiempo. En pocos segundos le ha leído el
futuro de la vida mientras la severa advertencia le provoca temores inmundos a
la hermosa mujer.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>La amistad, el amor, el miedo y el
terror, la fidelidad a sí mismo, la búsqueda de la libertad; una variada amalgama
de emociones que transporta a Marc vivir situaciones de extremo peligro; de
conducta asombrosa, dura y heroica a veces, triste en otras, la historia se
tiñe de muertes, y él debe matar para sobrevivir o morir en ello y urdir un plan
para no caer en manos de quien planea una venganza. Y una y otra vez se ve
forzado a luchar contra todos los elementos en los enfurecidos mares.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Salvar a Aina de una muerte cierta en el
temible mar le lleva a vivir aún más sobre el arma de doble filo en que se ha
convertido su vida, ella se muestra odiosa, desconfiada, la lujuria asalta de
pensamiento a Marc y peca de obra y gracia; poco después con la mente más
despejada surge la duda razonable al protagonista.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Lucha y vive por sobrevivir y debe volver
a matar de nuevo deseando no parecerse un poco más a un Dios menor. La gran
singladura de 6.500 millas náuticas, “la cuadratura del círculo” por siete
mares y un océano en sesenta y nueve días le obliga a vivir lo que jamás
hubiera imaginado individuo alguno.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>En un período de paz interna se recrea y
vive como hombre libre; mientras, alguien sufre y reza en silencio, le adora y
le ama, y tolera lo indecible por no quitarle ni interponerse en lo que más
quiere y desea aquel hombre.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Pero no desaparecen ahí las dificultades
y las penurias para Marc, una extraña presencia antes de empezar una nueva
travesía hace que perciba un aire gélido rozando su espalda y su nuca, un
escalofrío inunda su piel, la aprensión se manifiesta
maliciosa, se expande en el interior de su mente, y para más adversidad…</i></p>

Una gitanilla, desgarbada, menuda y
vivaracha, de edad indefinida, extraña, con apariencia de no haber roto en su
vida un solo pensamiento, toma del brazo a una bella mujer en plena calle después
de cruzarse con ella, le mira a los ojos y le lee su temblorosa mano, le
siembra un destino invariable en el tiempo. En pocos segundos le ha leído el
futuro de la vida mientras la severa advertencia le provoca temores inmundos a
la hermosa mujer.

La amistad, el amor, el miedo y el
terror, la fidelidad a sí mismo, la búsqueda de la libertad; una variada amalgama
de emociones que transporta a Marc vivir situaciones de extremo peligro; de
conducta asombrosa, dura y heroica a veces, triste en otras, la historia se
tiñe de muertes, y él debe matar para sobrevivir o morir en ello y urdir un plan
para no caer en manos de quien planea una venganza. Y una y otra vez se ve
forzado a luchar contra todos los elementos en los enfurecidos mares.

Salvar a Aina de una muerte cierta en el
temible mar le lleva a vivir aún más sobre el arma de doble filo en que se ha
convertido su vida, ella se muestra odiosa, desconfiada, la lujuria asalta de
pensamiento a Marc y peca de obra y gracia; poco después con la mente más
despejada surge la duda razonable al protagonista.

Lucha y vive por sobrevivir y debe volver
a matar de nuevo deseando no parecerse un poco más a un Dios menor. La gran
singladura de 6.500 millas náuticas, “la cuadratura del círculo” por siete
mares y un océano en sesenta y nueve días le obliga a vivir lo que jamás
hubiera imaginado individuo alguno.

En un período de paz interna se recrea y
vive como hombre libre; mientras, alguien sufre y reza en silencio, le adora y
le ama, y tolera lo indecible por no quitarle ni interponerse en lo que más
quiere y desea aquel hombre.

Pero no desaparecen ahí las dificultades
y las penurias para Marc, una extraña presencia antes de empezar una nueva
travesía hace que perciba un aire gélido rozando su espalda y su nuca, un
escalofrío inunda su piel, la aprensión se manifiesta
maliciosa, se expande en el interior de su mente, y para más adversidad…

<p>Books are the most affordable way to share expertise, to spark new ideas and to train interested people.

<p>Their latest book, ""The Dowsing Encyclopedia"", is awaiting the final steps before being published: cover design, formatting, creating the paperback, marketing.</p>
<p>It is costly to self-publish, and Maggie &amp; Nigel need your help to get this book out to the dowsing public. There is nothing like this book currently available to dowsers, and they believe it will make an excellent addition to anyone's dowsing library.</p>
<p>Your contribution shows your passion for dowsing and your desire to have high quality books on dowsing available at reasonable prices. To thank you, there are exclusive perks you won't see on Amazon.

<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Let me break down the basic costs of the shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting for all 3 shows is $27/month</li>
<li>It takes between <em>3hrs to 6hrs</em> to post-produce 1 Pagan Bed Time Story episode.</li>
<li>It takes between <em>2hrs to 4hrs</em> to post-produce 1 Pagan Women's or Lamyka's Wiccan Podcast episode.</li>
<li>The above doesn't include the time put in to organize, coordinate, research, etc. for the 3 shows.</li>
</ul>
<p>With <em>your h</em>elp I can pay for an <strong><em>entire year</em></strong> of hosting and basic operating costs. Not to mention set time aside for other helpful Pagan projects.</p>

<p><strong>For $50 you get</strong> a re-telling of whatever short children's/bed time story you'd like and I send the mp3 in an email to you for your family. Plus all of the above!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Your True Impact</h3>
<p>Every time I have a fundraiser it really helps to push me harder in making a better show or a better book. If you contribute to this fundraiser these are some of the things you might see in the future:</p>

<li>A Pagan prayer book for all ages</li>
<li>More Children's educational content</li>
<li>More discussion for Pagan Women with perhaps even study groups</li>
<li>A small scholarship for aspiring Pagan journalists and/or educators.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've accomplished so much in just the last 10 years at the shows here that each $1 spent goes right back into the Pagan Community.</p>
<p> </p>

Lamyka known for Lamyka's Wiccan Podcast (http://lamyka.libsyn.com/ & http://www.facebook.com/lamykaswiccanpodcast), Pagan Women's Podcast (http://www.facebook.com/PaganWomensPodcast), & Pagan Bed Time Stories (http://paganstories.libsyn.com/ & http://www.facebook.com/PaganBedTimeStories) is happy to announce the 2012 fundraiser.
But what does Lamyka provide you? Here's just a short list:

Interviews with movers and shakesrs in the Pagan Community
Topical discussion, not ranting or soap boxing
Pagan family oriented programming
Children's learning activities and supplies (including How Maui Slowed the Sun: Pagan Bed Time Stories Activity Book available on Amazon.com)
Shows and discussion for and by Pagan Women
And so much more!

I've scaled back the shows so that it's not too hard on my walet or time but even still every moment counts. Help me to continue in my mission to bring deeper discussion, knowledge, & childrens' materials to the Pagan Community!
 


What We Need
Let me break down the basic costs of the shows:

Hosting for all 3 shows is $27/month
It takes between 3hrs to 6hrs to post-produce 1 Pagan Bed Time Story episode.
It takes between 2hrs to 4hrs to post-produce 1 Pagan Women's or Lamyka's Wiccan Podcast episode.
The above doesn't include the time put in to organize, coordinate, research, etc. for the 3 shows.

With your help I can pay for an entire year of hosting and basic operating costs. Not to mention set time aside for other helpful Pagan projects.
 
What You Get
For $2 you get my Aloha for your support & a thank you on the Facebook Fan Pages.
For $5 you get a personal thank you--I'll mention your name or your business on the various shows and on the Facebook Fan Pages.
For $10 you get a Hawaiian Ringtone: I'll translate and record a sentence for you into Hawaiian and email you the mp3. This is a sentence or phrase of your choosing, whatever you'd like, even if it's ""The banana is on the sofa."" Plus a personal thank you on the shows and on the Facebook Fan Pages.
For $50 you get a re-telling of whatever short children's/bed time story you'd like and I send the mp3 in an email to you for your family. Plus all of the above!
 


Your True Impact
Every time I have a fundraiser it really helps to push me harder in making a better show or a better book. If you contribute to this fundraiser these are some of the things you might see in the future:

Another Pagan Bed Time Stories Activity Book!
A Pagan prayer book for all ages
More Children's educational content
More discussion for Pagan Women with perhaps even study groups
A small scholarship for aspiring Pagan journalists and/or educators.

We've accomplished so much in just the last 10 years at the shows here that each $1 spent goes right back into the Pagan Community.
 


Other Ways You Can Help
Everyone can help out by:

Spreading the word about the fundraiser or the shows
Purchasing my children's book, How Maui Slowed the Sun: Pagan Bed Time Stories Activity Book available on Amazon.com
Purchasing Pagan-made all natural non-chemical body products from my company Haumea Botanicals


 
Mahalo nui loa to everyone who makes this show a reality!

<p>If you want to own this very special instrument go to IndieGoGo and select the Follower of Erich Zann reward level. You’ll get this very special ukulele, along with the print and e-book versions of <em>Sword and Mythos</em>, a digital book package containing all of our current titles, and a one-year subscription to <em>Innsmouth Magazine</em>. Plus, a bonus hardcover edition of the upcoming <em>Fungi</em> anthology.</p>
<h2>Innsmouth Free Press: Sword and Mythos</h2>
<p>Sword and sorcery: the realm of daring assassins, crafty thieves and talented wizards. Lovecraft’s Mythos: a place where the weird, the horrifying and the strange coalesce. Both sub-genres should come together and you can make it happen.</p>
<p><em>Sword and Mythos</em> is an anthology to be edited by Silvia Moreno-Garcia and Paula R. Stiles, published through Innsmouth Free Press. Since 2009, Innsmouth Free Press has been publishing many fine authors in its magazine and anthologies, including W. H. Pugmire, Nick Mamatas, Ekaterina Sedia, Ann K. Schwader, Jeff VanderMeer, Laird Barron, Molly Tanzer, Jesse Bullington and many others. It has produced the anthologies <em>Historical Lovecraft</em> and <em>Future Lovecraft</em> (which was reprinted by Prime Books), and is releasing the <em>Fungi</em> anthology at the end of 2012.</p>
<h3>Why do we need the money?</h3>
<p><img alt=""Innsmouth Magazine"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/401804/pictures/full/20120822143336-2012-06_Cover-231x300.jpg?1345671295"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Innsmouth Free Press is a well-established Canadian micro-press. However, it has never been able to afford professional rates for the writers in its books. This is where, dear friend, you come in. We want to give <em>Sword and Mythos</em> the treatment it deserves, but, in order to do so, we need an injection of cash. Your money will go into the production of an awesome sword and sorcery book.</p>
<h3>What will the anthology be like?</h3>
<p>What kind of anthology will <em>Sword and Mythos</em> be? Well, it’ll have the sword and sorcery flavor you are looking for, but it will also thread further into unexplored reaches. Why should the worlds of wizards and heroes be limited to faux-European shores? We plan to look for international writers who can provide unusual backdrops and points of view. We want to feature tales of daring female warriors. We will look for kick-ass female writers, established authors and new voices. In short, we want to excite and inspire. We want to take you from cold mountains where icy palaces hide dark terrors, to distant deserts where ghouls roam in the sand dunes, and beautiful pagodas which shadow wizards of might and magic.</p>
<p><em>Sword and Mythos</em> would be released in October 2013.</p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>Some of our rewards include our books out in print. Titles we have currently released in paperback and e-book format include <em>Historical Lovecraft</em>, <em>Future Lovecraft</em>, <em>Candle in the Attic Window</em>, <em>Fraterfamilia.</em> <em>Innsmouth Magazine</em> issues are available only for e-readers. Our upcoming anthology <em>Fungi </em>will be available as a paperback, special hardcover edition and for e-readers.</p>
<p>Please note that if you are choosing a reward which includes the <em>Fungi </em>anthology, the anthology will be released in December 2012. You can therefore expect your shipment to go out that month. All other books can be shipped sooner.</p>

art, designed for people who want a unique, deep-reading experience. </p><p>The name of the magazine was inspired by William M. Tweed—commonly known as Boss Tweed—the politician who controlled New York City in the mid-19th century. Today, Boss Tweed is recognized as a symbol of American greed and corruption.</p>
<p><i>Tweed’s </i>will be printed on smooth, sturdy
paper—the kind that feels good to rub—and will be filled with captivating
fiction, engaging interviews, and absorbing art, poetry, and informative
essays. Everything you could ever want from a literary magazine will be woven
together into a harmonious reading experience that has the focus of a journal
and the beauty of a glossy. We’re creating <i>Tweed’s </i>because it’s the magazine we want to
read, and if you’re passionate about art and literature, we think you’ll want
to read it, too! </p><p>If we reach our goal of $11,000, we will be able to publish two
issues of <i>Tweed’s</i>,
which will be released in March and September of 2014. </p>
<p>Some of you may be familiar with our previous project, <i>The
Coffin Factory</i> (the
magazine for people who love books), which featured artists and writers
representing over 30 countries and was sold in Barnes &amp; Noble and
bookstores nationwide. But being available in nearly every bookstore in America
was extremely inefficient; we would print and ship thousands of magazines
across the country, only to see several thousand thrown away, their covers torn
off. This waste bothered us, and we decided it was time for a change. </p>
<p>So here’s how the production of <i>Tweed’s </i>will work: It will have a small print
run and be sold directly through our website and at select independent
bookstores. The thousands of dollars we’ll save by doing this will be used to
pay writers more. What this means is that the magazine’s content will be even
better, and trees won’t be cut down for naught. You can ensure you’ll get a
limited-edition copy of <i>Tweed’s </i>when you donate $25 or more to the campaign.</p>
<p>Who’s already in <i>Tweed’s</i>? The first issue will bring you
intimate conversations with Edwidge Danticat, John Freeman, and Sjón, with the
full list of contributors to be revealed soon. </p>
<p>In addition to the warm fuzzy feeling you’ll get from helping us launch
this independent artistic project, we have some irresistible goodies to offer
in gratitude of your support:</p>

<p><br/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Bit About Us</h3><p></p><br/><p>Without any previous
publishing experience or industry connections, we conceived, edited, and
designed <i>The Coffin Factory</i>. We used our savings to print the magazine
and pay writers, and with the help of our small team—made entirely of
volunteers—we created each issue between the hours of our daytime jobs. Over
the course of two years, we produced five issues with work representing over 30
countries. The magazine was available in bookstores nationwide, with
subscribers from all over the world. </p>
<p>Our interest in keeping reading culture alive led us to create The Library Donation Project,
through which we donated hundreds of magazines to public
libraries, universities, GED and ESOL programs, prisons, <span>writing programs, and community centers.</span> We’ve also held
several events to serve the New York City literary community, with panels such as
“What’s a Writer?” held at the New York Public Library, “Writing, Publishing,
and Editing in the Americas” held at McNally Jackson bookstore, “Who Gives a
Sh*t about Literary Magazines?” at BookCourt bookstore, and we’ve hosted many
launch party readings at Housing Works Bookstore Café in order to help raise
funds in the fight against homelessness and AIDS.</p><p></p><p>With your donations and support <i>Tweed’s </i>will be able to have an even more significant cultural impact. We’re proud to have accomplished all of this on our own, and now we’re eager to see what we can do together.</p><br/><p></p>

A Bit About UsWithout any previous
publishing experience or industry connections, we conceived, edited, and
designed The Coffin Factory. We used our savings to print the magazine
and pay writers, and with the help of our small team—made entirely of
volunteers—we created each issue between the hours of our daytime jobs. Over
the course of two years, we produced five issues with work representing over 30
countries. The magazine was available in bookstores nationwide, with
subscribers from all over the world. 
Our interest in keeping reading culture alive led us to create The Library Donation Project,
through which we donated hundreds of magazines to public
libraries, universities, GED and ESOL programs, prisons, writing programs, and community centers. We’ve also held
several events to serve the New York City literary community, with panels such as
“What’s a Writer?” held at the New York Public Library, “Writing, Publishing,
and Editing in the Americas” held at McNally Jackson bookstore, “Who Gives a
Sh*t about Literary Magazines?” at BookCourt bookstore, and we’ve hosted many
launch party readings at Housing Works Bookstore Café in order to help raise
funds in the fight against homelessness and AIDS.With your donations and support Tweed’s will be able to have an even more significant cultural impact. We’re proud to have accomplished all of this on our own, and now we’re eager to see what we can do together.
The
Coffin Factory is proud to have brought readers:
In-depth
conversations with Noam Chomsky, John Banville, and T.C. Boyle, as well
as the publishers of New Directions, The Overlook Press, Other Press, Farrar,
Straus & Giroux, and Twelve.

for The Coffin Factory:“A brilliantly imagined, highly readable, and important new literary magazine
with the most incongruous title.” Joyce Carol Oates""This “magazine for people who love books” distinguishes
itself in the quality of its short fiction and illustrations. New works by
mostly established writers include many in translation, giving Coffin
Factory a distinctly international vibe. Many of the illustrations
are depictions of new works currently on display in a gallery. All this
gives Coffin Factory a classy freshness sure to be enjoyed by anyone
who appreciates contemporary arts and literature."" The Library Journal
 “The
Coffin Factory has that
well-oiled, velvety feel of a magazine that has earned its spot in the stacks,
while also pushing some buttons and attempting to bridge the gap between old
and emerging technologies.”The Review Review",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><em>Beecher’s </em>magazine, published annually in Lawrence, Kansas and run by the students of the graduate program in creative writing at the <a href=""http://www2.ku.edu/~englishmfa/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">University of Kansas</a>, publishes the best in innovative creative nonfiction, poetry, and fiction, from both emerging and established authors. The name <em>Beecher's</em> is derived from the story of Henry Ward Beecher, a prominent abolitionist, publicly stated that when it came to fighting against Kansas slaveholders, there was more moral power in a Sharps rifle than there was in the Bible. Following his speech, the Sharps rifle quickly became known as a “Beecher’s Bible.” Rifles being shipped to fellow abolitionists in Kansas were shipped in containers marked as “Books” or “Beecher’s Bibles” in order to sneak them past pro-slavery fighters and to keep from raising any suspicion in the federal and state authorities, who prohibited the shipping of arms to the area. Hundreds of Beecher’s Bibles were brought to the region in the fight to make Kansas a free state.</p>
<p>In addition to publishing amazing writing, <em>Beecher's</em> also has a strong focus on design, envisioning a literary journal as something that not only contains literary art, but is a work of art in itself.</p>

The name Beecher's is derived from the story of Henry Ward Beecher, a prominent abolitionist, publicly stated that when it came to fighting against Kansas slaveholders, there was more moral power in a Sharps rifle than there was in the Bible. Following his speech, the Sharps rifle quickly became known as a “Beecher’s Bible.” Rifles being shipped to fellow abolitionists in Kansas were shipped in containers marked as “Books” or “Beecher’s Bibles” in order to sneak them past pro-slavery fighters and to keep from raising any suspicion in the federal and state authorities, who prohibited the shipping of arms to the area. Hundreds of Beecher’s Bibles were brought to the region in the fight to make Kansas a free state.
In addition to publishing amazing writing, Beecher's also has a strong focus on design, envisioning a literary journal as something that not only contains literary art, but is a work of art in itself.

<p>My name is Tommy Davey, and I have recently published the first novel in my Middle Grade mystery series featuring a character called Cora Flash.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I loved reading mystery series like the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew and the Enid Blyton series of Famous Five books. I soon moved up to the Agatha Christie books and enjoyed devouring them as quickly as I could.  I wanted to write a modern mystery series that could give kids today the same excitement that I used to feel, and hopefully encourage them to get into the wonderful habit of reading.</p>
<p>I wrote the first book in my series, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0075NS12Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>Cora Flash and the Diamond of Madagascar</em></a> as a nod to those books I enjoyed as a child, and to the Agatha Christie books.</p>
<p>I plan to release the second book in my series, <em>Cora Flash and the Mystery at Topaz Mountain</em> very soon, and am very excited to share her continuing adventures in an on-going series.  I was thrilled to have received very positive feedback from readers, both parents and kids, on the first book, and all have expressed great interest in reading more stories about Cora Flash. </p>
<h3><strong>What I am looking for...</strong></h3>
<p>After releasing the first book, I discovered building a core audience takes time, patience and most importantly, exposure. Although I have received an average of 4.9 out of 5 in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Flash-Diamond-Madagascar-Mystery-ebook/product-reviews/B0075NS12Y/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amazon.com reviews</a>, I still need to build my audience one purchase at a time. This is where you come in.</p>
<h3><strong>The campaign.</strong></h3>
<p>We all know the power of advertising. I have been researching the options for advertising and have even tested the waters of paid advertising with small campaigns. By far, the biggest impact I have seen was by being featured on a popular blog. It was the largest single day of sales I have experienced since starting this new venture and I am anxious to break into some of the larger book blogs.</p>
<p>In my research, I have found a PR company, <a href=""http://www.novelpublicity.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Novel Publicity</a>, whose mandate is to ""offer custom marketing campaigns and a variety of <em>à </em>la carte services to meet your promotional needs.""</p>
<div>As we all know, marketing costs money, and Novel Publicity is certainly no exception. The <a href=""http://www.novelpublicity.com/whirlwind-tour/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Whirlwind Tour</a> offered by Novel Publicity will expose my work to over 100 blogs in a very intense five day period, many of which will be a book review - the best form of advertising a book can receive. Novel Publicity has indicated to me that they would be willing to take me on as a client, and I would love to be able to use their services to spread the word about Cora.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The money I am seeking to raise will go to fund the $2500 Whirlwind Tour, as well as cover additional costs that total up to $500 for incidental costs, including contests and promotional copies of the book.</div>
<h3><strong>The Ultimate Goal</strong></h3>
<p>Writing has always been a passion of mine, and I would love to turn my passion into a full time career. A large advertising campaign such as this one will be a tremendous jump-start to my series, providing exposure and readers I could not reach on my own. </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways To Get Involved</strong></h3>

<p>I started this project about a year ago and only raised about half of what I needed to get this book up and running. After having knit nearly 500 bears, my arms and hands are starting to crap up badly, and I need to take one month away from knitting them to finish this book and rest myself. I live off about $600 a month from knitting my teddy bears and the funds will be used to take that month away from knitting to finish ""Will Knit For Food"" and recooperate some.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2010 I lost my job, then my savings, then my home. With no where to go I ended up living in the woods with my little cat Mario. We were 20 miles from the nearest town. Desperate and with only $2 left to my name, I started knitting teddy bears to sell so that I could feed myself.</p>
<p>I eventually made enough money to make it out of the woods, but little Mario and I were still in constant danger, always trying to find a place to live, always searching for a bed for us to rest in, food to eat, and still I kept knitting these teddy bears to keep us alive. We've at least found ourselves with a studio apartment now, a hot plate to cook off of, and a bed to sleep in. But, we're still not completely out of the realm of danger of being homeless again.</p>
<p>I want to write a book about my experience over this last year and a half, a book called ""WILL KNIT FOR FOOD."" As you can see by my photo, I'm hardly the first person you'd think of when you consider knitting. I look like I'm more suited for Nascar races than anything. I'm scruffy, scrawny, and with my drawl, an easy peg for being a redneck.</p>
<p>But, these teddy bears that I knit saved my life. Without that talent I would have starved, would have fallen through societies cracks and would have been tossed to the side by life quickly.</p>
<p>They still continue to keep me fed daily. I knit three to four bears a day, each of them bringing in a little hope when they sell, each of them allowing this little cat that I wouldn't part with, some sense that we can actually survive this time. We can.</p>
<p>But, we're in trouble. I have hope that this campaign will help Mario and I go from day to day to something more secure. Something we can rest with close to our hearts and remember that people care.</p>

<p>Last year, my daughter started full-day kindergarten and everything was new and different and she became a bit overwhelmed.

<p>So, I wrote this story to cheer her up and to show her that school isn’t so scary. Yay!!</p>
<p>I’ve read this story at a few schools and everyone seems to love it. The story is very sweet and the illustrations are adorable.</p>
<p>Here’s your chance to share in the Hicklebug fun!! The holidays are right around the corner and this book would make a great gift!!! And you’d be helping me to bring my books (and love of reading) to kids at local schools and libraries.</p>
<p>Right now, I need to get the initial run of “Hicklebug Goes to School” printed and that’s where you come in. The minimum print run (that makes any sense price-wise) is 100 copies. I’d love to order just a few copies at a time, but then I’d have to charge $25.00 a book!</p>
<p>By pre-ordering a copy of “Hicklebug Goes to School,” you’re helping to get everything up and rolling. And the more you can help, the more great perks you can receive. I have another book titled “Slugs Are Yummy!” that has been a huge hit with children and adults.

I understand that above and beyond the “Hicklebug” pre-order, your help is a vote of confidence for me as an artist. I am humbled and appreciative and you shall be justly rewarded!! :-)</p>
<p>Every little bit of assistance you can offer will go towards getting my new book off the ground. Even if my funding goal is not reached, it will still be a HUGE help.</p>
<p>So, not only will you get a copy of a delightful book for kids of all ages, you will be helping me bring this book to life!!</p>

  <div>
<div>
<p>In January, a literary agent told us <em><i>Infinite Purpose</i> </em>was the most unique and deeply-needed
book she'd seen in a long time - but that no publisher would take on the
financial risk of birthing a book so different and so expensive to produce. </p>
<p>""You will have to
publish it yourselves,"" she said, ""and tell everyone you know to tell
everyone <em>they </em>know that <strong>this is magic</strong>."" </p>
<p>We knew she was right.
There is magic happening here; the teachings of <em><i>Infinite Purpose </i></em>are already changing people in
phenomenal ways. And we know they are meant to impact so many more. To us, it's
worth the risk. </p>

<div>
<p>We are dear friends thrust into a heart-thumping,
soul-stirring collaboration in the fall of 2014. Out of the blue, Spirit
swooped in to deliver profound messages through Liv, inspired
art through Lori, and instructions (yes, really!) for sharing them
with the world.</p>
<p>We first shared
Spirit's <strong>eight-step

for over 250 brave souls. We were stunned by the profound shifts they
experienced and life changes they made. </p>

<div><strong><span style=""color: #ff00ff;"">A BOOK TO TREASURE  </span></strong></div>

<p>To expand the reach and impact of these sacred teachings,
we envisioned this book being an absolute treasure - filled to the
brim with moving personal stories, vivid art on nearly all of its
192 pages, and sacred space for in-depth reflection. </p>
<p><b>This book will forever change the way you connect to your calling, experience abundance, and create light in the world.</b><i> </i> We can't wait for you to hold this beautiful hardcover,

<div>
<p>So much loving care has gone into making <em><i>Infinite Purpose</i> </em>a substantial and beautiful book: it
is an 8x10 full-color, hardcover book with nearly 200 gorgeous pages! </p>
<p>Our $33,000
fundraising goal will help us cover our pre-production costs (we've been
so grateful to work with self-publishing agency Wise Ink on everything from
design to copyediting) and the hefty cost of printing. Publishing a book of
this nature is only affordable if we raise enough to do a healthy first
printing of 5,000 copies. (<i>gulp. we can do it, right??</i>)</p>
<p>If we raise more than
our goal (<i>gasp!
that would be amazing!!</i>), we'll be able to expand the reach of <em><i>Infinite Purpose</i> </em>through publicity, promotion, even a
book tour. We're so excited to spark an <i>Infinite
Purpose </i>revolution
with you! </p>

<p>Yes! We've consistently had requests for several items and have found ways to make them work, so we're really excited! First, we're thrilled to be able to offer a set of 8 professionally produced audio recordings of Liv Lane reading each of Spirit's eight teachings. It's not a full audio book, but we expect it be nearly two hours of digital audio that will be emailed to supporters. You can purchase the audio alone or with a book. </p>
<p>We've also had so many requests for prints of the artwork in the book, so we're thrilled to be able to offer really beautiful quality wrapped canvas prints. You can choose the painting you want (there are eight full-page paintings in the book) and it will be signed and dated by Lori. </p>
<p>And, finally, we've had so many people tell us they want their book clubs to read and discuss <i>Infinite Purpose</i> that we've added a really cool option; we'll provide your group with a discussion guide and beam in to your gathering with an hour-long Skype session to answer questions and share stories!</p>

I decided I had to finish it. </p><p>I started working on the book in August of last year, and it is now about halfway done.

Each letter of this book is taught by telling a short story about an animal with rhyming and alliteration. For example, “H is for Henrietta the Hare who much enjoys combing her hair.” (see below). My mom wrote the original text with the rhymes, and I put together all the creative direction for the illustrator.

But I guess that’s why I know it is going to turn out great. I'm putting everything I can into it. I’m personally excited about the book and everyone who has seen the art is as well. I can’t wait to share the final product with you.</p>

The Book is Done and ShippingFor newcomers, you can see the final product below, and you can also read on to see the full Indiegogo campaign below as well. You can order copies from teacherjudy.com. Art Prints are also available there. Life is the alphabetYou start at A, and you end on Z. A lot happens on that journey. As a child, maybe you wanted to be a veterinarian, a firefighter, or a ballerina. Or maybe you wanted to live on a farm, or to be an artist. You wanted to travel the world or to be an explorer.You start with so many dreams. The world is your oyster. Many believe that at a certain point in life, maybe around S, that they have to stop dreaming big. Teacher Judy disagreed. In her eyes, it was never too late to be a better person, or to follow another dream. While my mom has reached the end of her journey at Z, and is no longer here to see her work completed, her message and efforts in life will continue on with all of us who are still traveling through the rest of our alphabet chasing our dreams. And of course, her dream to publish a book will be realized, proving her point, that it’s never too late. Read more about how this book came to be below. How this book came to beIn 2016, I traveled to visit my mom in Ecuador, where she had settled for a new chapter in her life. She was teaching English at the time and, in typical Judy fashion, took it upon herself to write her own alphabet book to engage her students. She really wanted to get the book edited, illustrated and printed, so I connected her with some designers at that time, but the project never came to fruition. In July of last year, I got a phone call from my stepdad letting me know my mom had passed away from pancreatic cancer -- a disease I never knew she was sick with in the first place. The news came as a complete shock, and I made my way to Ecuador to seek closure and understand what had happened. In that period of reflection, I remembered my mom’s book project, the one I didn’t manage to help her complete. I decided I had to finish it. I started working on the book in August of last year, and it is now about halfway done. But to help get my mom's book to the world, I need your help. Photo of my mother and me in Ecuador in 2016. Book detailsFirst off, it's an alphabet book for children, but adults will also appreciate the book for the artwork. Each letter of this book is taught by telling a short story about an animal with rhyming and alliteration. For example, “H is for Henrietta the Hare who much enjoys combing her hair.” (see below). My mom wrote the original text with the rhymes, and I put together all the creative direction for the illustrator. (I also edited and rewrote a few of the letters.)I used my own experiences as a traveler and saw an opportunity to put the characters in places around the world, as part of the alphabet journey. I also considered my mom when I wrote the characters' scene direction, and the result is cute and clever, and some of the vignettes have subtle references that connect the characters. The book will be between 52 and 56 interior pages (printed double-sided). I am planning on printing on either 7 x 9 inch or an 8 x 11 inch format.Here are some illustrations from the book: What I need and what you getPrimary GoalI’m asking for your support to help fund the creation, completion and distribution of the book. By doing so, you will be ensuring that my mom gets to live on in this world doing what she did best: helping, teaching and inspiring others.In addition, 5 percent of the proceeds from each book sold will be donated to a scholarship fund for kids who need it the most. One thing I have considered is creating a fund for students at the school where my mother taught in Ecuador.I’m targeting raising $20,000 for this project. The costs are distributed across five main categories:
Illustrations: $10,000
Printing and shipping costs for 500 books: $5,500
Marketing budget for the book post-publishing: $2,000
Children's scholarship fund: defined by each perk, but will be roughly 5% of each contribution received
Indiegogo's platform fee: 5%
 If the fundraising goal is not met with this project, I will still put the funds toward completing the book and will print at least 250 copies -- all eligible backers will receive a copy and have their perks fulfilled.Stretch GoalIf I raise at least $50,000, I will work on another children's book and target releasing it in mid-late 2022.  Where we're at alreadySo far, I've already hired a wonderful artist, Alfonso Lourido, and we have 16 letters fully colored and the remaining sketched and awaiting coloring. The artwork shared within this campaign comes from the book! Throughout April, May and June 2020 we will continue with the coloring phase and finalizing the layout and pages!More about the ArtistAlfonso Lourido is an award-winning artist from Uruguay. I selected him for this project because my mom, her history, and my history are tied to South America, and specifically Ecuador. Alfonso also has ties to Ecuador; he used to live there and he is a native South American. This is, of course, in addition to the fact that he is a masterful, creative, and versatile illustrator.His visual work has been exhibited in various respected art galleries such as ACCS Visual Arts at Artsy, José Ignacio's “Los Caracoles” Gallery, “Settemari” Gallery in Punta del Este and in the busy ""Acatras del Mercado"" gallery in Montevideo's down town.He has also completed multiple children’s books, and in 2019 he was selected as a member of The Official Uruguayan Children and Youth Literature Catalog that was presented on the worlds most important and prestigious Children’s Book Fair: Bologna 2019.It has been amazing working with him so far. More about Teacher JudyMy mother led an interesting life.

<p>Doru Costache, <i>Early Christian and Byzantine Worldviews</i></p>
<p>This book explores representations of reality articulated at the crossroads of theology and culture in the early Christian and Byzantine periods. Patristic authors and texts are analysed in a chronological succession that unfolds according to the work’s title. In other words, the book addresses the Christian representations of reality as articulated in second and third century authors including Ignatius of Antioch, Irenaeus of Lyon, Clement the Alexandrian, and the author of the Letter to Diognetus. Turning to the fourth century, it addresses developments in Athanasius of Alexandria, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory the Theologian, and Gregory of Nyssa. Finally, the Byzantine worldview that expanded on the earlier articulations is explored and assessed in relation to Maximus the Confessor and John Damascene. This book is relevant not only for persons interested in past articulations of the Christian worldview, but addresses contemporary concerns for the rapports between scientific and theological representations of the cosmos, as well as for the engagement between Christianity and contemporary culture.</p>

<p>Doru Costache and Mario Baghos (eds), <i>John Chrysostom: Past, Present, Future</i></p>
<p>This book comprises chapters by a group of eight scholars from Australia and three from abroad, aiming to offer fresh, interdenominational and interdisciplinary perspectives on the life, thought and legacy of one of the most influential preachers and theologians of early Christianity, John Chrysostom. The contributors to this volume utilise a range of methodologies, pertaining to the fields of theology, history, hermeneutics, spirituality, hagiography, pastoral studies and linguistics. The volume thus unveils the wide ranging significance for Western and Eastern Christianity of Chrysostom’s various contributions, within the immediate and distant contexts of these contributions. This scholarly contribution to Chrysostomian, Early Christian, Late Antique and Patristic studies, is expected to be of immediate relevance the various Christian denominations in Australia and abroad which revere Chrysostom as a preacher, exegete, shepherd and theologian of note.</p>

<p>Mario Baghos, <i>The Founding of Constantinople as an Image and Centre of the World</i></p>
<p>This book critiques the positivism that conditions contemporary historiography—specifically Byzantine studies—which does not consider theology or religion in relation to the founding of cities in the ancient world. In the discipline of the history of religions, however, cities are considered images and centres of the cosmos, where the latter includes the sacred. Undertaking an interdisciplinary engagement with the history of religions, this book demonstrates that Constantinople, the capital city of the Eastern Roman Empire (also known as Byzantium), was founded as the summation and intersection of the cosmos according to a long standing tradition. This book addresses Constantinople's antecedent cultures that established their cities as images and centres of the world, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel, Greece, and Rome, before turning to the founding of Constantinople itself. It therefore provides a unique interdisciplinary approach to the city, based on the relevant primary and secondary sources, that sheds light on the role of religious symbolism within the New Rome.</p>
<p>AIOCS' founders ask for your assistance. While editing and design of the books will be handled in-house, we currently need to raise $6,000 to cover the printing costs of these volumes, about $2,000 each. If we do not reach our targeted goal, we still intend to allocate whatever funds generated from this crowdfunding campaign to the printing of these volumes.</p>
<p>These books represent a landmark in Orthodox Christian scholarship in the Antipodes, published by a press that has as its vision a direct engagement with contemporary culture both in Australia and abroad. These books are of immediate significance for the disciplines of Christian theology, patristic studies, Orthodox Christian studies, Byzantine history, the history of religions, Chrysostomian studies, and the relationship between Christianity and culture. Your contribution to our crowdfunding campaign will assist us in broadening the body of knowledge in these fields. It will also help give AIOCS Press a footing in the publishing world in a way that will not only enhance the scholarly profile of Orthodoxy in the Antipodes, but directly impact Australian and international scholarship at large.</p>

Patristic authors and texts are analysed in a chronological succession that unfolds according to the work’s title. In other words, the book addresses the Christian representations of reality as articulated in second and third century authors including Ignatius of Antioch, Irenaeus of Lyon, Clement the Alexandrian, and the author of the Letter to Diognetus. Turning to the fourth century, it addresses developments in Athanasius of Alexandria, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory the Theologian, and Gregory of Nyssa. Finally, the Byzantine worldview that expanded on the earlier articulations is explored and assessed in relation to Maximus the Confessor and John Damascene. This book is relevant not only for persons interested in past articulations of the Christian worldview, but addresses contemporary concerns for the rapports between scientific and theological representations of the cosmos, as well as for the engagement between Christianity and contemporary culture.

Doru Costache and Mario Baghos (eds), John Chrysostom: Past, Present, Future
This book comprises chapters by a group of eight scholars from Australia and three from abroad, aiming to offer fresh, interdenominational and interdisciplinary perspectives on the life, thought and legacy of one of the most influential preachers and theologians of early Christianity, John Chrysostom. The contributors to this volume utilise a range of methodologies, pertaining to the fields of theology, history, hermeneutics, spirituality, hagiography, pastoral studies and linguistics. The volume thus unveils the wide ranging significance for Western and Eastern Christianity of Chrysostom’s various contributions, within the immediate and distant contexts of these contributions. This scholarly contribution to Chrysostomian, Early Christian, Late Antique and Patristic studies, is expected to be of immediate relevance the various Christian denominations in Australia and abroad which revere Chrysostom as a preacher, exegete, shepherd and theologian of note.

Mario Baghos, The Founding of Constantinople as an Image and Centre of the World
This book critiques the positivism that conditions contemporary historiography—specifically Byzantine studies—which does not consider theology or religion in relation to the founding of cities in the ancient world. In the discipline of the history of religions, however, cities are considered images and centres of the cosmos, where the latter includes the sacred. Undertaking an interdisciplinary engagement with the history of religions, this book demonstrates that Constantinople, the capital city of the Eastern Roman Empire (also known as Byzantium), was founded as the summation and intersection of the cosmos according to a long standing tradition. This book addresses Constantinople's antecedent cultures that established their cities as images and centres of the world, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel, Greece, and Rome, before turning to the founding of Constantinople itself. It therefore provides a unique interdisciplinary approach to the city, based on the relevant primary and secondary sources, that sheds light on the role of religious symbolism within the New Rome.
AIOCS' founders ask for your assistance. While editing and design of the books will be handled in-house, we currently need to raise $6,000 to cover the printing costs of these volumes, about $2,000 each. If we do not reach our targeted goal, we still intend to allocate whatever funds generated from this crowdfunding campaign to the printing of these volumes.
These books represent a landmark in Orthodox Christian scholarship in the Antipodes, published by a press that has as its vision a direct engagement with contemporary culture both in Australia and abroad. These books are of immediate significance for the disciplines of Christian theology, patristic studies, Orthodox Christian studies, Byzantine history, the history of religions, Chrysostomian studies, and the relationship between Christianity and culture. Your contribution to our crowdfunding campaign will assist us in broadening the body of knowledge in these fields. It will also help give AIOCS Press a footing in the publishing world in a way that will not only enhance the scholarly profile of Orthodoxy in the Antipodes, but directly impact Australian and international scholarship at large.
