The pizza was a success but we were struck by the limitations of a pizza oven and the waste of heat.</p><p>It became apparent that <em>so </em>much more could be done with the same heat source and boiling water seemed one of the most obvious applications. We very quickly worked out that it needed to be transportable but also more flexible and the best way to achieve this was to make it telescopic.</p><p>We soon realised that this was not only a fantastic leisure concept but potentially a very good reilef tool for disaster areas, especially for, hurricanes, tsunamis and earthquakes where power and fuel supplies are lost but wood is normally available and heat, food and boiling water are basic necessities that the Aquaforno can provide. This added to our desire to make the Aquaforno a reality.</p><p>An oven or BBQ that could be floor or table mounted also seemed to add flexibility and convenience. The drying racks came about as friends kept asking if we could dry their kids clothes and we have found them useful for dish cloths, towels, and swim suits as well as shoes and cooking utensils.</p><p>Today, the latest generation Aquaforno can be fully assembled in under 2 minutes, it also packs away to a very convenient space saving size. It cooks beautifully, keeps you warm and provides you with boiling water on tap! It enhances your life outside, whether you are at work or at play.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>               </em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p><em>Take it anywhere</em></p><p>You really can take it anywhere; to the beach, the park, the game for tailgating or camping/hunting/fishing - it will fit into any truck, car or boat.

A hot coffee or tea wherever you are.....</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>.'..a brilliant piece of kit...'   Neil Davey @dinehard</em></p><p>  <em>Food. Drink. Travel. Games. Entertainment. Writing about the above for The Guardian, delicious, Metro, Sainsbury's, MSN, Square Mile, SAGA.. </em></p><p><em> <a href=""http://www.thelambshankredemption.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thelambshankredemption.blogspot.com</a></em></p><p><em> </em></p><p> '<em>One of the best ideas I've seen in a long time'</em> </p><p>                              Bob Lyndsey    Inventors Club Kingston University, UK</p><h2><strong><em> </em></strong></h2><h2><strong><em>Technical  details</em></strong></h2><p>The Aquaforno derives all its heat from the fire pit in the base using wood or charcoal. The water boiler is located within the base and surrounds the fire which ensures you can always have quick water boiling times regardless of most weather conditions.</p><p>Above the fire pit and kettle sits the BBQ grill which can be used with or without the upper sections and finally the top oven is the highest level. The racks clip on or off at lid level and can be used for drying clothes or keeping your utensils to hand.</p><p>With standard fuelling the oven will normally stay between 350-410 F (180-210 C) but if using the Aquaforno as a Pizza oven or Tandoor the fire pit can be filled with wood or charcoal to just above kettle level which allows the stone to reach temperatures in excess of 840 F (450 C). </p><p>All the body sections are spun or rolled from mild steel which is phosphated for added protection before the high temperature coating is applied. The legs, kettle, BBQ and racks are all made from food grade stainless steel.</p><p>Your new Aquaforno will also come with a special tray that fits underneath. This will allow a second heating area ideal for use as a cheese melt or even to let your dough rise. With this in place the Aquaforno can be table mounted. The user will have to ensure there are no safety issues but we have been using Aquaforno's on tables for 18 months and find that it can be the most convenient way to cook, effectively having an eye level oven. The adjustable legs however allow use on uneven ground too.</p><h3><em><strong> </strong></em></h3><h3><em><strong>         The Aquaforno                          The Piccoloforno </strong></em></h3><p>Packed size 17"" X 12"" (430mm x 300mm)     13.5""  x 7.5"" (340mm x 190mm) </p><p>Fully Up 39"" (990mm)                                        31.5"" (800mm)</p><p>Weight 42 lb (19 KG)                                         25 lb  (11.5 KG)</p><p> </p><p>                              </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/></p><h2><em><strong>The Piccoloforno</strong></em></h2><p>The Piccoloforno is a scaled down version of the Aquaforno, it is perfect for couples, bikers,anglers, hikers and boaters.

You can let it boil dry without worry and its tried and tested design allows you to safely see when it is boiling. The lid can be removed to allow you to add steam to the cooking process and because it is so easy to clean you can even use it for mulling cider or wine whilst you are sat around the fire on a cool night or cooking chestnuts.</p><p>Water capacity is approximately up to a Quart /Litre of boiling water from a full kettle, if just a couple of cups of water is required it can take less than a minute.</p><p><em><strong>Racks</strong></em></p><p>The racks are designed to hang and dry wet clothes as well as cooking utensils. Safety has been considered within the design to ensure the racks will bend or fall if a child tries to swing on them or if they are put under too much load.</p><p><em><strong>Gloves</strong></em></p><p>The high heat resistant gloves should be worn at all times and allow you to use your Aquaforno with confidence especially for adding and removing sections as and when you want to as shown in the manual. </p><p><em><strong>Back Pack</strong></em></p><p>Your new Aquaforno and Piccoloforno will also come with a back pack to help you carry it and allow you to hang it in the garage or a cupboard for storage.</p><p><strong><em>Assembly</em></strong></p><p>No tools are needed to assemble the Aquaforno it is very straightforward.  It twists and slides up and down in a user friendly way. The top two sections can be removed if the fire pit only is needed - if you're walking a fair distance your friends and family can carry a section each or take two Piccolofornos!</p><h2><em><strong>Accessories</strong></em></h2><p>We have plans on the drawing board for retro-fit accessories such as a rotisserie and gas burner units which will fit into your existing Aquaforno as well as a range of traditional bbq utensils.</p><h2><strong><em>Production schedule</em></strong></h2><p>We believe in local manufacturing worldwide, for both social and environmental reasons. The Aquaforno is currently hand made in the UK for our European customers near our home in North Hampshire. At a point when our US sales volumes are significant we hope to manufacture in North America to save on shipment and to employ people locally.</p><p>To date the Aquaforno has only been made in very small volumes which have prevented the company being viable long term. With advanced orders we can source the taps, stones, grills and powder in sufficient volumes to be cost effective. Equally necessary is the ability to fine tune certain components of the Aquaforno which is possible with more sophisticated tooling.  </p><h2><strong><em>Shipping</em></strong></h2><p>We were recently quoted nearly $500 to send one Aquaforno to Boston - making it difficult for American residents to buy one - that is until Indiegogo came along! With anticipated take up from America, we believe we can deliver cost effectively, however even if we don't reach our goals we will still honour or refund any pledges. For any contributor outside of North America or Europe, please contact us prior to pledging for costs.</p><h2><strong><em>Funding</em></strong></h2><p>Reaching our funding goal will allow us to source parts in higher volumes, making the Aquaforno commercially viable. With sufficient backers in North America we will be able to deliver your Aquaforno to your door cost effectively.</p><h2><em><strong>Perks</strong></em></h2><p>Pre - order an Aquaforno or a Piccoloforno and America gets to enjoy the benefits of this brilliant cooking device.</p><p>All support is gratefully received and this can be by pledging or just by spreading the word to your friends, colleagues and family. This will be your first step in joining us for the ride. </p><p>All perks come with a photo of the birth place of the Aquaforno - Upper Lodge Farm- British countryside at its best and the ability to order an Aquaforno Limited Edition at any time.</p><p> </p><p><strong>                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/581173/pictures/full/20121214015017-An_aquaforno_recipe_book_1.jpg?1355478623"" src="""" title=""An Aquaforno recipe book""/></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/581199/pictures/full/20121214024159-Upper_Lodge_Farm.jpg?1355481727"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong>                                             Upper Lodge Farm</strong></p><h2><strong><em>FAQs</em></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Warranty</em></strong></p><p>The Aquaforno comes with a full years warranty covering parts and labour. The stone is ceramic and therefore cannot be covered although we do keep stock for those occasions when it is dropped, so it can be replaced at a reasonable cost. For US Aquaforno owners, there will be available pizza stone stock for delivery in land.</p><p><strong><em>Durability</em></strong></p><p>The Aquaforno has been designed to be part of your family for a long time. The mild steel has been coated for durability and there is stainless steel where required. Packing the unit away does not take long and will definitely buy you  many more years' use.</p><p><strong><em>Fuel</em></strong></p><p>The Aquaforno is designed to burn wood, charcoal and any of the modern solid BBQ fuels. We have a gas burner on the drawing board which will be an optional retrofit into any existing unit, big or small.</p><p><em><strong>Care / Cleaning</strong></em></p><p>The Aquaforno can be easy to clean, we recommend laying the sections on grass and cleaning with a normal garden hose. Hot soapy water can be used on the coated surfaces and all stainless steel parts can be placed in a dishwasher or scrubbed just like your pans at home.</p><p><strong><em>Storage</em></strong></p><p>Garage, cupboard or hang it on a wall, we always keep one in the car.</p><p><em><strong>Safety</strong></em></p><p>We have considered safety issues as a priority whilst designing the Aquaforno.  We believe the low centre of gravity is an added benefit when compared to many BBQ's and from the design of the racks and painstakingly tested kettle to the adjustable securable legs and high temperature gloves. We like to think of the Aquaforno as as safe or safer than most BBQ's on the market. </p><p>When using or working with fire and high temperatures the user should always be attentive and act responsibly.</p><h2><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></h2><p>Credits to cedarpeas - web &amp; photography, clare smith photography</p><p>And finally a very grateful thank you in advance for any pledges made and allowing us to expand the horizons of the Aquaforno.</p><p> </p><div><h2><em><strong> </strong></em></h2></div><p> </p><p><em> </em></p></div>","Our story,                             The Aquaforno started life when our oldest daughter wanted a camping party, with Pizza, on her grandfather's small farm for her 13th Birthday.

From pizza to paella, roasts to ratatouille or stir fry, anything can be done -   savour the rustic flavours and aromas that infuse the food.                                               From packed to assembled in under two minutes   As featured on BBC Radio 2 'Inventor's slot' July 13th 2012 BBC Radio 4 'You and Yours'         Cook anything                                            Homemade pizza                                                                               Sunday roast - al fresco                              A hot brew at the allotment The Aquaforno has ample room for approximately  15 -20 baked potatoes in the top oven whilst cooking steaks or burgers simultaneously on the grill.  We've had fun baking scones and bread rolls -  pastry works a treat (better than our oven at home) so the sky (and the woods and the beach and the river and the mountains) is the limit with both sweet and savoury dishes. Hot water on tapAnd let's not forget the integral kettle!  A brilliant yet simple part of the overall benefits of the Aquaforno. A hot coffee or tea wherever you are.....  .'..a brilliant piece of kit...'   Neil Davey @dinehard  Food. Drink. Travel. Games. Entertainment. Writing about the above for The Guardian, delicious, Metro, Sainsbury's, MSN, Square Mile, SAGA..  www.thelambshankredemption.blogspot.com  'One of the best ideas I've seen in a long time'                               Bob Lyndsey    Inventors Club Kingston University, UK Technical  detailsThe Aquaforno derives all its heat from the fire pit in the base using wood or charcoal. The water boiler is located within the base and surrounds the fire which ensures you can always have quick water boiling times regardless of most weather conditions.Above the fire pit and kettle sits the BBQ grill which can be used with or without the upper sections and finally the top oven is the highest level. The racks clip on or off at lid level and can be used for drying clothes or keeping your utensils to hand.With standard fuelling the oven will normally stay between 350-410 F (180-210 C) but if using the Aquaforno as a Pizza oven or Tandoor the fire pit can be filled with wood or charcoal to just above kettle level which allows the stone to reach temperatures in excess of 840 F (450 C). All the body sections are spun or rolled from mild steel which is phosphated for added protection before the high temperature coating is applied. The legs, kettle, BBQ and racks are all made from food grade stainless steel.Your new Aquaforno will also come with a special tray that fits underneath. This will allow a second heating area ideal for use as a cheese melt or even to let your dough rise. With this in place the Aquaforno can be table mounted. The user will have to ensure there are no safety issues but we have been using Aquaforno's on tables for 18 months and find that it can be the most convenient way to cook, effectively having an eye level oven. The adjustable legs however allow use on uneven ground too.          The Aquaforno                          The Piccoloforno Packed size 17"" X 12"" (430mm x 300mm)     13.5""  x 7.5"" (340mm x 190mm) Fully Up 39"" (990mm)                                        31.5"" (800mm)Weight 42 lb (19 KG)                                         25 lb  (11.5 KG)                               The PiccolofornoThe Piccoloforno is a scaled down version of the Aquaforno, it is perfect for couples, bikers,anglers, hikers and boaters. It is based on a 13"" diameter with a 12"" stone but still has all the same features and identical parts.                                                   Aquaforno and Piccoloforno Features Pizza Stone/ OvenAllows you to bake or cook through almost anything but does of course do excellent pizzas One of our favourites is baked brie and hot ciabatta - divine with some red onion chutney!GrillsFood Grade polished stainless steel, not just plated mild steel.Kettle / BoilerThe integral removable kettle is dishwasher friendly and gives reliable repeatable boiling water literally on tap!! You can let it boil dry without worry and its tried and tested design allows you to safely see when it is boiling. The lid can be removed to allow you to add steam to the cooking process and because it is so easy to clean you can even use it for mulling cider or wine whilst you are sat around the fire on a cool night or cooking chestnuts.Water capacity is approximately up to a Quart /Litre of boiling water from a full kettle, if just a couple of cups of water is required it can take less than a minute.RacksThe racks are designed to hang and dry wet clothes as well as cooking utensils. Safety has been considered within the design to ensure the racks will bend or fall if a child tries to swing on them or if they are put under too much load.GlovesThe high heat resistant gloves should be worn at all times and allow you to use your Aquaforno with confidence especially for adding and removing sections as and when you want to as shown in the manual. Back PackYour new Aquaforno and Piccoloforno will also come with a back pack to help you carry it and allow you to hang it in the garage or a cupboard for storage.AssemblyNo tools are needed to assemble the Aquaforno it is very straightforward.  It twists and slides up and down in a user friendly way. The top two sections can be removed if the fire pit only is needed - if you're walking a fair distance your friends and family can carry a section each or take two Piccolofornos!AccessoriesWe have plans on the drawing board for retro-fit accessories such as a rotisserie and gas burner units which will fit into your existing Aquaforno as well as a range of traditional bbq utensils.Production scheduleWe believe in local manufacturing worldwide, for both social and environmental reasons. The Aquaforno is currently hand made in the UK for our European customers near our home in North Hampshire. At a point when our US sales volumes are significant we hope to manufacture in North America to save on shipment and to employ people locally.To date the Aquaforno has only been made in very small volumes which have prevented the company being viable long term. With advanced orders we can source the taps, stones, grills and powder in sufficient volumes to be cost effective. Equally necessary is the ability to fine tune certain components of the Aquaforno which is possible with more sophisticated tooling.  ShippingWe were recently quoted nearly $500 to send one Aquaforno to Boston - making it difficult for American residents to buy one - that is until Indiegogo came along! With anticipated take up from America, we believe we can deliver cost effectively, however even if we don't reach our goals we will still honour or refund any pledges. For any contributor outside of North America or Europe, please contact us prior to pledging for costs.FundingReaching our funding goal will allow us to source parts in higher volumes, making the Aquaforno commercially viable. With sufficient backers in North America we will be able to deliver your Aquaforno to your door cost effectively.PerksPre - order an Aquaforno or a Piccoloforno and America gets to enjoy the benefits of this brilliant cooking device.All support is gratefully received and this can be by pledging or just by spreading the word to your friends, colleagues and family. This will be your first step in joining us for the ride. All perks come with a photo of the birth place of the Aquaforno - Upper Lodge Farm- British countryside at its best and the ability to order an Aquaforno Limited Edition at any time.                                                                              Upper Lodge FarmFAQsWarrantyThe Aquaforno comes with a full years warranty covering parts and labour. The stone is ceramic and therefore cannot be covered although we do keep stock for those occasions when it is dropped, so it can be replaced at a reasonable cost. For US Aquaforno owners, there will be available pizza stone stock for delivery in land.DurabilityThe Aquaforno has been designed to be part of your family for a long time. The mild steel has been coated for durability and there is stainless steel where required. Packing the unit away does not take long and will definitely buy you  many more years' use.FuelThe Aquaforno is designed to burn wood, charcoal and any of the modern solid BBQ fuels. We have a gas burner on the drawing board which will be an optional retrofit into any existing unit, big or small.Care / CleaningThe Aquaforno can be easy to clean, we recommend laying the sections on grass and cleaning with a normal garden hose. Hot soapy water can be used on the coated surfaces and all stainless steel parts can be placed in a dishwasher or scrubbed just like your pans at home.StorageGarage, cupboard or hang it on a wall, we always keep one in the car.SafetyWe have considered safety issues as a priority whilst designing the Aquaforno.  We believe the low centre of gravity is an added benefit when compared to many BBQ's and from the design of the racks and painstakingly tested kettle to the adjustable securable legs and high temperature gloves. We like to think of the Aquaforno as as safe or safer than most BBQ's on the market. When using or working with fire and high temperatures the user should always be attentive and act responsibly.ThanksCredits to cedarpeas - web & photography, clare smith photographyAnd finally a very grateful thank you in advance for any pledges made and allowing us to expand the horizons of the Aquaforno.",9.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>I will be a student of the Decipleship Training School (DTS) in Youth with a Mission's (YWAM) Milan base.

I own and personally fund a cheerleading company and an All-Star cheerleading team on the south side of chicago(Storm All-Star Elite). Cheerleading is my absolute passion and I've found a platform to spread that passion to inner-city children throughout Chicago. As a male cheerleader at Tennesse State University from 2003-2006, I have learned that cheerleding is much more than pom poms and skirts. It is not ""Rah Rah Sicum Bah"" , it is a SPORT! My company, MyCheerNow.com, has been on a mission to spread ""Real Cheerleading"" to our urban youth. During our 3 years in existence we have worked with over 500 cheerleaders, making a difference in the lives of each and every one. We teach skills that earn girls and boys scholarships to their colleges of choice, and at the same time implement life lessons.</p>
<p>MyCheerNow.com has the goal of having AT LEAST 100 inner city cheerleaders enrolled into our All-star cheer program by the summer of 2013. Almost every single day a staff member meets or runs into a girl/boy who would love to join our program but simply cannot afford to come up with the monthly tuition.  There is too much untapped talent in our inner-city community and that needs to change. MyCheerNow.com has been on a mission to find these girls and boys who love the sport of cheerleading but who cannot afford the monthly fee. For months we have been sponsoring several cheerleaders to be a part of our program, who have all progressed at an unsightly rate. We have done great with the people we have helped but with your assistance we can do better!</p>
<p>MyCheerNow.com is asking that you or your company help sponsor a cheerleader. Our tuition is the lowest in the city at $65.00 per/mnth. Your contribution will allow a cheerleader to cheer for at least one year in our program. If we can reach $5,000.00 by the summer of 2013 then MyCheerNow.com will be able to let 100 girls who could otherwise not afford to cheer be a part of our amazing cheer program. There is too much untapped talent in the inner-city community and with your help WE can really make a difference!</p>
<p>You will be able to witness the cheerleader’s progress first hand both as athletes and young ambassadors for our future. All sponors/potential sponsors are encouraged to attend our practices to witness the progression of the child who's life they have changed.  As one of the fastest growing sports in the world grows even larger, we need to make sure that our young inner-city men and women are not passed up during this evolution of cheer. Nothing is better than watching that girl/boy get that first back-handspring, or that basket toss! Our goal is to never turn down a cheerleader because they cannot pay tuition, but instead to insure that we do our best to give every cheerleader a chance to learn the sport with a high quality staff and team, and with your help, no child anxious to learn will be turned around.</p>

<p><span>Any new product brings with it a few risks. We face 2 kinds of risks here: </span></p>
<p><i>Product Risk</i> - Aster is a backpack that’s also an electronics product. We need to ensure that Aster can not only handle daily wear-and-tear, but also make sure that the electronics are robust enough to handle crashes. We’re confident that the pilot lot will help us identify any errors. The prototypes will also be put through more rigorous testing during the campaign, helping us identify vulnerabilities in the design. We will keep you updated as we identify any potential problems.</p>
<i>Delivery Risk</i> - Our team has delivered 2 products from the concept stage to the final high-quality production piece, which will help us avoid common errors that could potentially cause delays in production. Although we work with a seasoned manufacturer, there is a possibility that we’ve under-estimated the time needed for manufacturing, so we’ve added a buffer in our timelines. The pilot lot of 50 would also help us correct the manufacturing processes as well.<div>

</div></div>","“The lights on the pack could be seen by my partner brightly to the end of the street (over 100m!!!) And cars kept right away from me” - Beta Tester
Beta Backers from 18 countries have been testing Aster since November. Scroll down to read their feedback!

Aster improves visibility, reduces accidents and saves lives! Aster's rear and profile lights make you visible to motorists from all sides, front lights signal your presence in rear-view mirrors and automatic brake lights help you avoid getting rear-ended. Integrated turn signals make sure that drivers around you know when you’re making a turn.

Presenting Aster - World's safest commute cycling backpack!
With a USB-rechargeable 8,000 mAh in-built battery, Aster can light up 10-15 hours of your commute under normal conditions. 


Rear light makes sure you're visible even on the darkest streets. Profile lights make you visible from the sides.Brake lights get deployed by Sidekick (the handle-bar unit) when you brake. Indicate using the buttons on Sidekick (the handle-bar unit).

Front lights in action, best for visibility in rear view mirrors.

SIDEKICK AND MOBILE APP CONTROLS
Aster also ships with an app called the Lumos Aster app to provide add-on functionality. You can use the app to control Aster’s light settings, get low-battery alerts and enable anti-theft protection features. The Aster, the Sidekick and the Lumos Aster mobile app are connected via Bluetooth Smart, courtesy Nordic Semiconductor's nRF51822. The lights can be switched on from Sidekick itself and do not need the app. 



CRASH SENSOR AND ALERT 
Sidekick sits on the handlebar of your cycle and when you have a high-impact crash, it will trigger a buzzer on your phone, asking you 'Are you OK?'. If you cannot respond (via app or Sidekick) within a configurable time, the App will message your coordinates to your emergency contact. The user can deactivate this feature, if not required.
On sensing a crash, the app alerts your emergency contact.

Aster comes in two striking colors, both of which come in either 18L or 24L capacity. With its sleek shape and discreet appearance, the backpack blends in at the workplace. 

Aster has several commuter-specific compartments – a minimalist helmet holder, a whistle buckle, tuck-away U-lock holder loops, zippered bottle pockets, rain-cover and an 'In Case of Emergency' information slot In the event of a crash, important information such as blood type, allergens and emergency contact numbers can be accessed easily.


A commuter's best friend!


You can pack a 15.6 inch laptop with charger, change of clothes and shoes, smaller gadgets, books, bike-tools and spares, rain-jacket, a 1-liter water bottle and even your lunch! 

Room for your 15.6"" laptop, 1-Liter water bottle and your bike tools.

Aster opens up completely, allowing for easy packing and selective access.
The bag is also weather-resistant, with a waterproof TPU coated exterior and rain-resistant zippers that cause water to bead up and roll off the surface.

Waterproof zippers keep the water out!
What's more, it makes for easy cleaning, which means you don't have to worry about splash-back! 
Easy-to-clean waterproof material!
 

 
In November 2016 we shipped out Aster Beta backpacks to 50 Beta testers across 18 countries. Since then, Aster has been rigorously tested in all conditions from peak Australian summers to sub-zero Swedish winters. Here's what some of our beta testers had to say about their Aster.
 

 

 “The lights on the pack could be seen by my partner brightly to the end of the street (over 100m!!!) And cars kept right away from me”
“The lights are awesome and in general the layout with the different zippered pockets is excellent.”
“I was also surprised how bright the back lights of the Aster were. I was blinded by the red light, and I think that I could use it even at daytime. This is amazing!”
“The opening is possibly the best opening of any bag that I have. It's fantastic.”
“I now finally got the Aster Beta - and it is beautiful!”
“Impressed with the ""In Case Of Emergency' feature...Because we are nurses so it's a very useful feature for us in case of emergency.”
“The quality of the backpack is great.. I like the zippers and it's very comfortable to wear it. I drove a couple of time in the rain, with and without raincap. No porblem at all, nothing went wet.“
“I absolutely like the profile lights. I think it's making me much more visible from the side.”

 

Thanks to the tireless efforts of our Beta testers, we've have invaluable feedback about both Aster and Sidekick. Aster is already in production, Sidekick is undergoing a few design tweaks, making it smaller, and easier to use with winter gloves. The basic version of the app is available on Android and iOS, and we are now building additional functionality into the app. 

 



A combination of super-geeky engineers and creative designers who are mad about cycling is what the diverse Lumos team is built of. We believe that an improvement in cycling safety would lead to an overall higher adoption of cycling as a form of commute across the world! 
We’ve successfully delivered solar-powered cyclist backpacks (the Lumos unPlug Solar Backpack and the Lumos ThrillSeeker Solar Backpack) across 16 countries over the last 3 years. These backpacks have an integrated Solar Fabric (yes fabric, not panels), so riders can charge their devices with the bag, while on the move! In fact, the ThrillSeeker was voted by BikeMagazin.de as one of 15 innovations to watch out for at EuroBike!



Aster's already created a buzz! 



Any new product brings with it a few risks. We face 2 kinds of risks here: 
Product Risk - Aster is a backpack that’s also an electronics product. We need to ensure that Aster can not only handle daily wear-and-tear, but also make sure that the electronics are robust enough to handle crashes. We’re confident that the pilot lot will help us identify any errors. The prototypes will also be put through more rigorous testing during the campaign, helping us identify vulnerabilities in the design. We will keep you updated as we identify any potential problems.
Delivery Risk - Our team has delivered 2 products from the concept stage to the final high-quality production piece, which will help us avoid common errors that could potentially cause delays in production. Although we work with a seasoned manufacturer, there is a possibility that we’ve under-estimated the time needed for manufacturing, so we’ve added a buffer in our timelines. The pilot lot of 50 would also help us correct the manufacturing processes as well.
 



When do the brake lights come on? The brake lights detect your speed in intervals of 300 milli-seconds. They detect a deceleration of approx 0.8kilometers per hour/0.5 miles per hour within 300 milli-seconds. 
If I lock my bike using the app and the bike falls over, wouldn't it trigger  the alarm? The alarm triggers only if there is a directional motion for longer than 5 seconds. For example, if the bike is constantly vibrating (parked in a shaky ship maybe?), it wouldn't trigger the alarm.  Can I change the color of the lights? Can I make them brighter? Lumos app gives you control over the brightness of the lights. You can change the brightness within the allowed range. Changing the color is not allowed at this time, and wouldn’t be advisable. The colors we have used are carefully chosen to match what other motorists expect. Also, regulations in several geographies restrict the colors of lights while biking. Would Aster replace my existing bike lights? No. The Aster adds a layer of security. In some countries, Aster meets the rear lights regulations. But it is recommended that you use the Aster in conjunction with your existing lights. 
Is the backpack water-proof? 

The bag is made of waterproof TPU coated Polyester fabric, and has a water-resistant zip protecting the main compartment. This means rain droplets will bead up and roll off the surface of the bag. In a very heavy rain shower, however, water may eventually penetrate the seams of the bag. We advise using the raincover provided.
 

Have you identified the manufacturers?Yes. We already manufacture both Electronics and Backpacks for another line of cycling products. We have worked with our existing partners to create the prototypes, and have discussed the timelines in detail with them. 

 

In the UK/EU the recognized indication to turn left or right is by hand signal as laid out in the highway code. What is the legal position on using lights as an indicator of turning? We would advise you to always follow local laws and regulations. Hence, while the indicator would be tremendously useful, we would recommend that you use it in addition to the hand signal.

 
Is the handlebar unit water-proof? Can it handle exposure to Sun/heat? 
The handle-bar unit is being built to be weather-resistant. It will withstand up to 10 cms of rain. In case of heavy rains or prolonged exposure to the elements, we recommend that you remove the unit. The handlebar unit can also withstand long exposure to Sun and heat. Its operational temperature 0 degrees Celsius/32 degree Fahrenheit to 55 degrees Celsius/131 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 

Can I leave the handle-bar unit on the bike?Yes, you can. The handlebar unit can only be detached through the use of Allenkey. If used with the theft alarm, attempts to steal the handlebar unit would also trigger the alarm.

 

How often do I need to change the battery in the handle-bar unit? How do I change it? The handle-bar unit is a low power device. You can expect about 300 hours of usage from it. Changing the handle-bar unit battery is simple. An instructional video will be prepared for the same - though the instruction manual that ships with Aster will also detail the procedure out. 

 
How do I know if the handle-bar unit battery is low? 
The handle-bar unit would independently give you a low battery warning. At any time, you can check the handle-bar unit battery levels through the app. The app will warn you too, when your battery levels go below 15%. 
 
What happens if I lock my bike and then my phone goes out of charge? 
The app helps you set a 10-key secret combination on the handle-bar unit. So, instead of the app, you can use the combination of the 3 keys on the handle-bar unit to key in your code, and the bike will unlock! 
 
What certifications would the electronics meet? 
The electronics would meet the required and applicable CE and FCC certifications.We will update all backers on status of certifications. Our other product (Lumos ThrillSeeker) is also CE-certified and we sought certification for the same from TUV. 
 
What happens if I lose my phone? 

You can continue to use Aster and operate it through the handle-bar unit. Without the phone, you can’t configure the lights. Is the app available for Android and iPhone? Yes

 
Which version of Bluetooth does the app work with? 
The app uses Bluetooth 4.0 to connect to Aster and the handle-bar unit. If you have doubts, please mail us your phone model number and we can advise you appropriately. 

 
What is the warranty on Aster? Aster comes with a  year replacement warranty (against manufacturing defects) on both the electronics and the backpack itself. 


How much will shipping / delivery cost?The shipping has been calculated per region and will be added before you check-out on the Indiegogo page. 

 
Will I be charged Customs duty or ‘administration fee’? 

This is complicated and depends significantly on the the country you are ordering from. Short answer is that you are likely to be charged customers in your country and you would be asked to pay it at the time of delivery. You can use www.dutycalculator.com to get an idea about the customs.

 

Can you handle the VAT from your end before we receive Aster? Yes, the prices include all taxes and that includes VAT. If logistically, we are unable to pay the VAT from India, we might request you to pay it and refund you through Paypal.",28.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Makers are people who make things (like it says on the tin). Artists, crafters, builders, engineers, scientists, DIYers—they come from every age, race, gender, and lifestyle. The one thing they really have in common is that at some point in their life, they looked at a clock radio and thought, ""I really should take that apart.""</p>
<p>Periodically, these people who make things gather at gatherings—Maker Faires—to share the things they make. Sometimes, what they've made are modified Power Wheels race cars, which they race for short-track glory.</p>
<p>At <a href=""http://www.redmountainmakers.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Red Mountain Makers</a>—a non-profit maker space in Birmingham, and arguably the city's coolest—Team T-Wrecks has spent the past few months designing, engineering, re-engineering, and tinkering with the Clever Girl: our <i>Jurassic Park</i>-themed entry into the Power Racing Series, bringing together the exhilaration of the track and the horror of being chased by an escaped T-Rex. The difference between claiming victory and getting smoked at the starting line (or, let's face it, not getting to Atlanta at all)? You.</p>

</div></div>","It started with one red Power Wheels Jeep, six grown adults who are old enough to know better, and a dream. The dream? To bring home the checkered flag in the Power Racing Series at Maker Faire Atlanta. That would involve turning a child's electric ride-on toy into a battery-powered racer topping 30 mph to compete against similarly violated racers—all for less than $500.
Makers, Red Mountain Makers, and Team T-Wrecks
Makers are people who make things (like it says on the tin). Artists, crafters, builders, engineers, scientists, DIYers—they come from every age, race, gender, and lifestyle. The one thing they really have in common is that at some point in their life, they looked at a clock radio and thought, ""I really should take that apart.""
Periodically, these people who make things gather at gatherings—Maker Faires—to share the things they make. Sometimes, what they've made are modified Power Wheels race cars, which they race for short-track glory.
At Red Mountain Makers—a non-profit maker space in Birmingham, and arguably the city's coolest—Team T-Wrecks has spent the past few months designing, engineering, re-engineering, and tinkering with the Clever Girl: our Jurassic Park-themed entry into the Power Racing Series, bringing together the exhilaration of the track and the horror of being chased by an escaped T-Rex. The difference between claiming victory and getting smoked at the starting line (or, let's face it, not getting to Atlanta at all)? You.

Be a Part of Team T-Wrecks 

Your contribution will go to help finish out the build on the Clever Girl, keep her in batteries (because we'll need plenty), purchase protective gear for the team (because this can actually be dangerous, y'all), and transport us to Atlanta for the event. Funds donated beyond our campaign goal will be put toward next year's Power Racer, and/or still more batteries.
All joking aside, this is a really big deal for us, and we have lovely presents to offer those who join the team.
XOXO,
Team T-Wrecks

<h3>A Survival Staff for a Perfect Hike</h3>
<p>You may think Arizona is just a big desert, but it's not. If you travel NORTH, you will find the high desert, rich with PONDEROSA PINES, ASPENS, and dormant volcanoes. The last volcano erupted over 800 years ago and has left us with beautiful, rocky hiking trails. We conceptualized the Sojourner Outdoor Staff (SOS) while making one of our hikes, the Bear Jaw and Abineau Trails. The hike down was just as challenging as the hike up due to the steep stopes and cinder on the San Francisco Peaks. As we began with the design, we discovered that we could actually make something that could carry survival gear as well. We searched the Internet high and low and found nothing to satisfy what we were looking for. That's when the ideas started flowing...first the stainless steel tip to create stabilization, then the modular hollow aluminum tubes to make the staff lightweight and watertight, and then the basic survival gear within those tubes.<br/><br/>We are excited to be able to begin production of this product and offer it to other avid hikers. If you are going to be carrying a staff, why not have something more.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Here's what can go into the SOS:</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>The <strong>stainless steel tip </strong>provides balance and stability when hiking through the roughest terrain.</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470882418/dkq9xvva7ozz3va66n2d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>A must-have for any camper. The reusable magnesium <strong>fire starter </strong>includes a steel striker</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472404354/akby06j9tksgejengefi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>The <strong>emergency first aid kit </strong>provides the basics-adhesive bandages, butterfly closures, sterile alcohol pads, gauze, tweezers, iodine swab, and a tourniquet.</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472404427/zzwkyk4f0m5ygxgpza6u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>The <strong>steel saw blade </strong>is essential to any camper. The saw blade is useful in cutting limbs for shelter and for cutting firewood.  It can be fitted within any of the tube sections and is accessible at any time by breaking down the staff.</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470883130/rfuddw5c0jy1edlccn0d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>The <strong>water purifier </strong>contains a straw filter and can filter up to 30 gallons.</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470883864/yj3i1ilhejwf9irhhtel.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;height: 281px;""/></p>
<ul><li>One of key design elements of the SOS is the <strong>adjustable sling</strong>. Its purpose is to permit shouldering the staff when not needed or both hands are required for activities such as climbing or rappelling. The quick detach points allow the sling to be removed when not needed.</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472404477/fs6hv6n2eqyfrwwhuyoj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>The SOS is painted with a Duracoat finish ® two part epoxy paint system. Although not scratch proof they are extremely resistant to abrasions after curing. The Duracoat finish ® is placed over a type 2 hard anodized primary finish to aid in long term durability. Colors from left to right are Sedona red, indigo, coral, OD green, teal, coyote, and ammonite. New colors will be available in a near future.</li></ul>

<ul><li>State-of-the-art design software and CNC machining centers are used to make this project a reality. All design and manufacturing are done in-house. At this point, we have already completed an initial pre-production run of the staff. Attention to detail is critical and constant review of the product and process cannot be stressed enough.</li></ul>

<ul><li>The main challenge for the SOS is production speed. While we have already gone through multiple prototypes and design generations, we need to cut the production time significantly. We need everyone's help to boost our production speed. We have done as much to mitigate production delays as we possibly can, including getting a head start on the next production run, machining optimization, and working with the paint manufacturer to use a paint hardener that cures in one quarter the normal time. With help from you and full funding of our  Campaign, we will be able to purchase a CNC lathe and boost production speed by more than 500%.</li></ul>

You may think Arizona is just a big desert, but it's not. If you travel NORTH, you will find the high desert, rich with PONDEROSA PINES, ASPENS, and dormant volcanoes. The last volcano erupted over 800 years ago and has left us with beautiful, rocky hiking trails. We conceptualized the Sojourner Outdoor Staff (SOS) while making one of our hikes, the Bear Jaw and Abineau Trails. The hike down was just as challenging as the hike up due to the steep stopes and cinder on the San Francisco Peaks. As we began with the design, we discovered that we could actually make something that could carry survival gear as well. We searched the Internet high and low and found nothing to satisfy what we were looking for. That's when the ideas started flowing...first the stainless steel tip to create stabilization, then the modular hollow aluminum tubes to make the staff lightweight and watertight, and then the basic survival gear within those tubes.We are excited to be able to begin production of this product and offer it to other avid hikers. If you are going to be carrying a staff, why not have something more.

 
Here's what can go into the SOS:
 
The stainless steel tip provides balance and stability when hiking through the roughest terrain.

 
A must-have for any camper. The reusable magnesium fire starter includes a steel striker

 
The emergency first aid kit provides the basics-adhesive bandages, butterfly closures, sterile alcohol pads, gauze, tweezers, iodine swab, and a tourniquet.

 
The steel saw blade is essential to any camper. The saw blade is useful in cutting limbs for shelter and for cutting firewood.  It can be fitted within any of the tube sections and is accessible at any time by breaking down the staff.

 
The water purifier contains a straw filter and can filter up to 30 gallons.

One of key design elements of the SOS is the adjustable sling. Its purpose is to permit shouldering the staff when not needed or both hands are required for activities such as climbing or rappelling. The quick detach points allow the sling to be removed when not needed.

 
The SOS is painted with a Duracoat finish ® two part epoxy paint system. Although not scratch proof they are extremely resistant to abrasions after curing. The Duracoat finish ® is placed over a type 2 hard anodized primary finish to aid in long term durability. Colors from left to right are Sedona red, indigo, coral, OD green, teal, coyote, and ammonite. New colors will be available in a near future.

The Shop
 

State-of-the-art design software and CNC machining centers are used to make this project a reality. All design and manufacturing are done in-house. At this point, we have already completed an initial pre-production run of the staff. Attention to detail is critical and constant review of the product and process cannot be stressed enough.

The main challenge for the SOS is production speed. While we have already gone through multiple prototypes and design generations, we need to cut the production time significantly. We need everyone's help to boost our production speed. We have done as much to mitigate production delays as we possibly can, including getting a head start on the next production run, machining optimization, and working with the paint manufacturer to use a paint hardener that cures in one quarter the normal time. With help from you and full funding of our  Campaign, we will be able to purchase a CNC lathe and boost production speed by more than 500%.

<p>It smells great to you but not to them. Here are the main ingredients used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Citronella</strong> - Hands down the most effective natural alternative to DEET</li>
<li>
<strong>Peppermint</strong> - Refreshing to us, revolting to mosquitoes</li>
<li>
<strong>Lemongrass</strong> - Nothing repels a mosquito better than this lemon-citrus scent</li>
</ul>

<p>Have you every heard a sound that makes you cringe? The Bandito emits a sound that makes mosquitoes cringe. This sound is so irritating to mosquitoes that they'll fly away before bothering you.</p>
<p><strong>Hear it for yourself!</strong> Place it close to your ear and you'll notice a faint buzzing. It's nearly impossible for humans to hear otherwise. Mosquitoes, on the other hand, will be hearing it for sure!</p>
<p>Still curious? Check out the video below to get a better idea of how loud the Bandito is outside.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""391"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/273227257?color=a6ce39"" width=""695""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p style=""font-size:12px;line-height:1.8em;"">*The perception of the sound can vary based on the device you play the video with. It only provides a rough indicator of what the real life experience will be like.<br/>** The perception of how loud the wristband is differs based on the surrounding sounds. We have found that it is not noticeable if you wear it outside, but in a quiet room you will notice it. You can always turn it off when you are inside  which will also save battery life.</p>

The Bandito shields you from mosquitoes by combining two of the most powerful proven repellent technologies. Say goodbye to annoying itching.
 

 


WHAT THE MEDIA SAYS


 

 



PRODUCT FEATURES:
 HOW DOES THE BANDITO WORK?



 

 

 NON-TOXIC SCENT STRIPS
It smells great to you but not to them. Here are the main ingredients used:


Citronella - Hands down the most effective natural alternative to DEET

Peppermint - Refreshing to us, revolting to mosquitoes

Lemongrass - Nothing repels a mosquito better than this lemon-citrus scent


 SONIC SOUND
Have you every heard a sound that makes you cringe? The Bandito emits a sound that makes mosquitoes cringe. This sound is so irritating to mosquitoes that they'll fly away before bothering you.
Hear it for yourself! Place it close to your ear and you'll notice a faint buzzing. It's nearly impossible for humans to hear otherwise. Mosquitoes, on the other hand, will be hearing it for sure!
Still curious? Check out the video below to get a better idea of how loud the Bandito is outside.

*The perception of the sound can vary based on the device you play the video with. It only provides a rough indicator of what the real life experience will be like.** The perception of how loud the wristband is differs based on the surrounding sounds. We have found that it is not noticeable if you wear it outside, but in a quiet room you will notice it. You can always turn it off when you are inside  which will also save battery life.
 


REFILLS


 

 
REFILLS EXPLAINED
Each Bandito refill will last for 1 season (3 months) and includes:

12 vacuum sealed scent strips*
1 battery**

*We recommend changing the scent strips every two weeks. (Lasts for 3 months!)**The battery lasts about 500 hours. (That's 5.5 hours of usage a day for 90 days!)

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


  How did you come up with the idea for the Bandito? //Our founder, Paul, got bitten by a mosquito over the summer of 2017 and couldn't sleep from the itchy welts left behind. He immediately began researching eco-friendly, yet effective, and portable solutions. He found that sound and smell repel mosquitoes best. The problem was that these solutions were either outlet-only or smell-only. After working with a team of scientists, Paul landed on the natural scents and sonic sound that make the Bandito wristband so powerful today. Why Bandito? //The Bandito utilizes scent and sound to help fend off mosquitoes from the comfort of your wrist! The silicone band has multiple holes so that you can adjust it to fit any size arm. Clip it to your backpack, shorts, or anywhere! It’s ready to protect! The Bandito has an easy to use button to turn the sonic sound on and off and engineered slits for maximum scent ventilation. Does the Bandito work with other bugs? //  No, but it’s highly effective at blocking you from mosquitoes and ensures that your outdoor experiences are stress-free. Is the Bandito dangerous for pets? //  No! Your pets are safe. We designed the Bandito to have a minimal impact on you and your animals. How do I know the Bandito is activated? //  Simply turn the Bandito on and put it to your ear. If you hear a faint buzz the sonic sound is activated! Now, put it to your nose. If you smell it, you're good to go! How does the Bandito work? //  The Bandito utilizes EPA approved insect repellents such as lemongrass, citronella, and peppermint. These ingredients have been widely accepted as the most effective natural substitutes for DEET. The sonic sound is designed to imitate mosquito predators which keeps mosquitoes at bay. If you still have concern why don't you try out the Bandito? If it doesn't work to your satisfaction you can always return it within 14 days upon delivery. :) How long does the Bandito repel mosquitoes? //  
We recommend changing the strips every 2 weeks for maximum effectiveness. Each Bandito includes 12 strips which will last 1 season (3 months). Strips are shipped vacuum sealed to stay effective over time! One refill pack comes with 12 scent strips and one battery which can be easily exchanged.

<br/><br/>INSPIRED BY ORIGAMI GENIUS ROBERT J. LANG</h3><p>This campaign is about going back to our original inspiration. Our founder and inventor Anton Willis read an article about Robert J. Lang in the New Yorker magazine about applying the concepts of origami to everyday products. He decided to use origami to solve a very San Francisco problem – how could he store a kayak in a small city apartment? Many paper models later, the first Oru Kayak was born. While Robert J. Lang doesn’t fold origami kayaks, he has a collection of over 160 trademark folds, some of them amazingly complex. They are intricate and beautiful in both their flat and folded state. For this Indiegogo edition of the Coast XT, with the blessing of Robert J. Lang himself, we’re paying homage to the “Birdwing Butterfly” with a custom skin print of the fold pattern. Like Oru Kayaks, the butterfly embodies transformation, freedom, and beauty.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520468121/ytal0itvzprinu6n32ck.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Fold pattern to Birdwing Butterfly</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520468179/wny6iexn5yjqvr5izrvm.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Robert J.

NEVER STOP INNOVATING
We’ve made major improvements to the assembly process, comfort and fit, and safety of our flagship kayak. The 2018 Coast XT is an incredible 16-foot kayak that weighs just 34 lbs., and fits in the trunk of your car. We’re on Indiegogo because after months of testing, feedback, and development, we’re ready to bring this kayak out into the world. 2018 Coast XT NEW FEATURESSo what’s different about this model? In order of awesome to epic:
Deck lines
Thigh braces
Zipper channels
Entire fold pattern.
WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?Thigh braces: Built-in on every 2018 Coast XT, the thigh braces have been redesigned to be more comfortable and easily adjustable. The thigh braces are game changers when it comes to stabilizing your core, maneuvering in rough waters, and staying comfortable for hours in the cockpit.Zipper channels: We’re excited about this one. Thanks to this design change, the assembly of the Coast XT is now almost as quick and simple as the Bay ST.

<p></p></div>","The Lodge
Charit Creek is one of five backcountry lodges in the country that cannot
be reached by car.  We feel fortunate to have this awe-inspiring place
here in Tennessee's back yard. Adding to its uniqueness is that it is located in
the heart of Big South Fork, one of the few National Recreational Areas
administered by the National Park Service.  Big South Fork was developed
to provide a wide range of recreational activities such as hiking, biking,
horseback riding, paddling and hunting.  This attracts a diverse group of visitors
to the lodge.  
As concessionaire's J Moore & Gregg White's friendship
developed sharing a passion for hiking and backpacking.  We sought out his
opportunity to share our enthusiasm for the outdoors, while preserving this local
natural resource.  

Contributors to our cause will help
us to overcome the challenges inherently related to operating a remote backcountry lodge.  Charit Creek Lodge is
100% off the grid and its buildings are listed on the National Historic Register.  The remoteness creates logistical challenges
we often take for granted at home.  Your
support is key to our success in improving and upgrading the lodge, its grounds
and amenities we offer to our guests.What We NeedWe are raising these funds to assist
us in improving the facilities and high level amenities to provide the ultimate
guest experience.  Your support will be
part of a larger investment to procure many of the following items in order
from critical to long term:ImpactThere are multiple ways to purchase or donate to the lodge through one of our many perks, of which some are unique to this campaign.Your impact will be great, partnering with us to reach our goal.  All contributors will be listed on our
website and at the lodge!
Risks & ChallengesOur obstacles are diverse and unique.  Much of the same that makes Charit Creek
Lodge such a unique and serene place also creates its many challenges.  Being off the grid means all of our energy
must be carted in from firewood for heat, propane for cooking, refrigeration and
hot showers, to kerosene for lighting. 
We operate our own well, pumping and treating the Lodge’s water
supply.  Linen service is provided for
our full service guests and must be laundered off-site.  Food service takes extra planning and preparation.  Sharing our message in the shadow of the
Great Smokey National Park is a feat in itself.
We Have a PlanAs local Knoxville business owners’
we have experience in customer service, project & operations management and
hospitality.  Our keen sense of business acumen
allows us to create a strategy to mitigate our risks and find solutions to our
challenges.

<p>The objective of this campaign is to raise a small amount of funding for the only youth cycling team in northern Albania. The team is composed of a small group of extremely talented kids who love cycling and bicycle racing but, unfortunately, have little equipment and few resources with which to pursue their passion. You can help by providing small monetary contributions, or donating your old cycling GPS unit or cycling computer.</p>
<h3>My Pitch...</h3>
<div>Right... A campaign aimed at raising funds for a youth cycling team in an obscure city in northern Albania? I know, to many of you this may seem to be coming from way outside of left-field, so let me explain myself a bit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>My name is William Hunter, I'm a native of the Carolina's in the good 'ole US of A, a former competitive road cyclist, and now a Peace Corps Volunteer serving in the small, mountainous nation of Albania. I love everything to do with bicycles, from road racing to mountain biking, commuting to critical masses, to simply repairing old, beat-up steal frames. However, I also love traveling, volunteering, and exploring new cultures, and when I accepted my invitation to serve for two years as a volunteer in Albania I did so with the expectation that I might need to put my passion for cycling on hold for a while. Albania, after all, is still a developing nation, and though it lies only a few hours from no less a bicycle crazed nation than Italy, cycling for pleasure is still foreign concepts to most Albanians. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>My first few months in Albania seemed to confirm my suspicions; cycling, and outdoor recreation in general, is just not very popular here. To most, the idea of touring the nation by bicycle seems as impossible a task as traveling to the moon and back. This was fine by me though. I had my own bicycle and could still enjoy my passion, even if I had to do it alone. But then something strange happened - <span style=""background-color: initial;"">after a while I began to hear rumors of a city far to the northwest where it was said that everyone owned a bicycle. In fact, people often refered to this city as ""Qyteti i Biçikleteve,"" or in Englsih, ""The City of Bicycles."" </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The city's name is Shkodër, and after a bit of research on it's bicycle culture I came to realize that Shkodër has a long and interesting history as the first Balkan city to embrace two wheeled travel. (Below are two links which expound a bit on this history) </span></div>

</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Fantastic, so a city with such a storied and interesting connection with bicycles is bound to have a top notch cycling team? Right? A team which is the pride of the city, the crown jewel (as far as cycling culture is concerned) of the Balkan Peninsula - right?</span></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Wrong.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div> I'll spare you the details of my travel to Shkodër and my first few weeks there, but suffice it to say I did not find the rigorously trained, well equipped, and panache endowed cycling team I had expected. Instead, after asking around for a few days, I was led to the Vllaznia Futbol Stadium and Sports Club. There, in what amounted to a storage shed behind the stadium, I was introduced to the seven members of the Vllaznia Youth Cycling Team. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>They are young: not one of them over the age of 16.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>They ride a mishmash of steel and aluminum framed bicycle from the 80's and 90's which have been wrecked and repaired so many times that often one cannot tell what brand they were originally.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Their kits are similarly worn; all of them having been charity hand-me-downs from Italy or England, and most are two or more sizes too large for their owners.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Their helmets are worn simply for aesthetic purposes; their heroes in the grand tours wear helmets, so they do to, even if the only helmets they own are cracked in half and no longer offer any sort of protection.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>But let me tell you, these kids are talented. They possess a drive and passion unrivaled by youth cyclists I have met in the United States. Furthermore, had they been born in the United States, I am certain that a number of them would have already been picked up by a development team. They are <i>that good.</i>
</div>
<div>So good, in fact, that after just a few rides with them I knew that I needed I was to make it my mission as a Peace Corps Volunteer to try and help these kids through any means at my disposal.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is, in my opinion, rather modest. We are simply trying to raise the funds required to design and purchase ten or so custom cycling kits and a few cycling GPS units. These young cyclists represent a city which doesn’t even know they exist, and this is pretty unsurprising, seeing as how a rag-tag group of kids in worn out spandex does not elicit much attention from the general public, let alone any feelings of town pride. But a polished peloton in well fitting, matching kits bearing the all too well known title <i>Vllaznia</i> on their backs would almost certainly turn heads. If this were the reality then maybe Albania’s famed city of bicycles would begin to recognize the talented youth it has fostered, and then maybe the people of Shkodër would begin to place more importance on supporting the team themselves with funding for new bicycles, travel expenses, training equipment, etc. These kids have the talent, all they are lacking is recognition…</p>

</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <p>Being a Peace Corps volunteer, I am not really in any position to offer any fantastic rewards for those who pledge large sums of money to this cause. I can however, provide the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>A signed thank-you letter from myself, the Vllaznia cycling coach, and the team, with an enclosed photo to those who pledge $50 or more. </li>
<li>I can add eight sponsor logos to the kits we will have designed for the team, so I am offering these those who donate $200 or more. First come first serve.</li>
<li>And of course, no mater what size donation you give, you can take pleasure in the fact that you are not only helping to promote the beautiful sport of cycling in a nation where it has yet to make serious inroads, but also helping to make the dreams of seven boys from a developing nation a reality.</li>
</ul>
</div><p><br/></p><div> <h3>Other Ways To Help: Donate Your Old GPS Unit</h3> <p>Would you like to help but are unable to contribute monetary assistance? No problem. In addition to raising money to pay for team kits, race registration fees, and travel expenses, etc., another goal is to provide the team with some sort of GPS cyclocomputer system. If you would like to donate any used handheld GPS devices, be they from Garmin's cycling specific line or otherwise, we would happily receive them.</p>
<p>They can be any make or model, as long as one can purchase a cycling mount for them and they are still in working order. Like I said, they don't need to be cycling specific. I use a Garmin E-Trex 30, and it performs just fine...</p>

If this were the reality then maybe Albania’s famed city of bicycles would begin to recognize the talented youth it has fostered, and then maybe the people of Shkodër would begin to place more importance on supporting the team themselves with funding for new bicycles, travel expenses, training equipment, etc. These kids have the talent, all they are lacking is recognition…


What You Get If You Donate

    Being a Peace Corps volunteer, I am not really in any position to offer any fantastic rewards for those who pledge large sums of money to this cause. I can however, provide the following:


A signed thank-you letter from myself, the Vllaznia cycling coach, and the team, with an enclosed photo to those who pledge $50 or more. 
I can add eight sponsor logos to the kits we will have designed for the team, so I am offering these those who donate $200 or more. First come first serve.
And of course, no mater what size donation you give, you can take pleasure in the fact that you are not only helping to promote the beautiful sport of cycling in a nation where it has yet to make serious inroads, but also helping to make the dreams of seven boys from a developing nation a reality.

 Other Ways To Help: Donate Your Old GPS Unit Would you like to help but are unable to contribute monetary assistance? No problem. In addition to raising money to pay for team kits, race registration fees, and travel expenses, etc., another goal is to provide the team with some sort of GPS cyclocomputer system. If you would like to donate any used handheld GPS devices, be they from Garmin's cycling specific line or otherwise, we would happily receive them.
They can be any make or model, as long as one can purchase a cycling mount for them and they are still in working order. Like I said, they don't need to be cycling specific. I use a Garmin E-Trex 30, and it performs just fine...
These donations can be shipped to this address in the United States:
Sandra Hunter
534 Brush Creek Rd.,
Fairview, NC, 28730

Guess I'm supposed to put down some risks here, so, ""might get TOO many babes?"" Ha!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>My name is Arek Karagoezian and I am a 26 year old registered nurse working in the Cardiac Care Unit of AUB medical center. I am also a volunteer member of Stronghold's band and YFC (Youth For Christ).</p>
<p>In 2008 I took part in a bike ride that was 4300 miles and 60 days long crossing the United States from west coast to east coast. It was a very positive experience during which we raised awareness and funds for the work of YFC. Now I will be participating in a bike ride around Switzerland for the same cause. It will be one week long, covering a distance of 775 Km through the Swiss Alps. I believe reaching out to teenagers and helping them reach maturity on many levels is the best investment one can make, to be effective in making a positive change in this world. This is what we do at YFC with an emphasis on spiritual maturity in Christ, by introducing them to Christ and helping them become devoted followers.</p>
<p>By helping us financially you will contribute to 2 main elements of our summer camp. One will be sponsoring teens who can't pay the registration costs, so that they may attend and hear the Gospel. We believe that finances should not be a barrier to someone getting a chance to hear about Jesus. We are expecting around 100 kids at summer camp this year.</p>
<p>The second is that we are planning to buy tents to help accomodate a larger number of kids at camp this year. We want to allow for at least 25 students who will be staying in these tents. This investment would not be for just a one time thing. These tents will also be used for weekend camping and retreats as well as future summer camps. It is a long term investment.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We thank you for partnering with us and helping us financially. We would also like your support in prayer as we consider that the most important support anyone can give. </p>
<p>If you know people around you who would like to hear about this cause and maybe keep us in prayer, and/or like to make a contribution, please don't hold back, let them know. </p>

<h3>About me and the story</h3>
<div>
<p>During the last year the people of Athens went through a number of changes in their lives. Most of these changes are depicted on the faces of the inhabitants, while the outcome of those is reflected on the surrounding buildings.</p>
<p>My name is <strong>Christonikos Zonafos</strong>. I live in Athens / Greece and I see the city changing, showing both anger and peace, desperation and happiness. What I see everyday is what I'd like to show to you, holding a photography exibition and printing a hardcover book with the moments I've captured during the last year.</p>
<p>The exhibition will be held for two weeks - aiming for September 2012 - in the exhibition room of The Greek Comics Club in Athens, while the book will be available worldwide (through the internet) during the same dates.</p>

<h3>Για Εμένα και Το Εγχείρημα</h3>
<div>
<p>Τον τελευταίο χρόνο οι κάτοικοι της Αθήνας έχουν υποστεί πολλές αλλαγές στη ζωή τους. Οι περισσότερες από αυτές σκιαγραφούνται στα πρόσωπά τους, ενώ οι συνέπειές τους αντικατοπτρίζονται στα γύρω κτήρια.</p>
<div>Ονομάζομαι <strong>Χριστόνικος Ζονάφος</strong>. Ζω στην Αθήνα και βλέπω την πόλη να αλλάζει, βγάζοντας μαζί θυμό και ηραμία, απόγνωση και ευτυχία. Αυτό που βλέπω κάθε μέρα είναι αυτό που θέλω να σας δείξω κάνοντας μία έκθεση φωτογραφίας και τυπώνοντας ένα σκληρόδετο βιβλίο με στιγμές που απαθανάτισα τον τελευταίο χρόνο.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Η έκθεση θα είναι για δύο εβδομάδες - στοχεύοντας για τον Σεπτέμβριο του 2012 - στον εκθεσιακό χώρο της Λέσχης Φίλων Κόμικς στην Αθήνα, ενώ το βιβλίο θα είναι παντού (μέσω internet) τις ίδιες μέρες</div>
<p> </p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Τι Χρειάζεται &amp; Τι Παίρνετε</h3>

<li>1400 euro (~1900$) για την εκτύπωση και αποστολή 50 σκληρόδετων φωτογραφικών βιβλίων</li>
<li>700 euro (~950$) για την εκτύπωση και αποστολή 10 μεγάλων υφασματόδετων φωτογραφικών βιβλίων (Μου αρέσει όπως δείχνουν εδώ: <a href=""http://www.blurb.com/proline"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.blurb.com/proline</a>)</li>

About me and the story

During the last year the people of Athens went through a number of changes in their lives. Most of these changes are depicted on the faces of the inhabitants, while the outcome of those is reflected on the surrounding buildings.
My name is Christonikos Zonafos. I live in Athens / Greece and I see the city changing, showing both anger and peace, desperation and happiness. What I see everyday is what I'd like to show to you, holding a photography exibition and printing a hardcover book with the moments I've captured during the last year.
The exhibition will be held for two weeks - aiming for September 2012 - in the exhibition room of The Greek Comics Club in Athens, while the book will be available worldwide (through the internet) during the same dates.
 



What Is Needed & What You Get
What is needed is :

750 euro (~1000$) for printing and framing the photographs (30 of them) for the exhibition
200 euro (~250$) for printing an exhibition catalog along with some promotional material
1400 euro (~1900$) for printing 50 hardcover photo-books and having them shipped
700 euro (~950$) for printing 10 special oversized linen-hardcover photo-books and having them shipped (I like the look of it here: http://www.blurb.com/proline)

adding paypal & indiegogo payment fees and a small donation for the exhibition room it adds up to a total of 3500 euro (~4600$)
Here enters you!

<p>I am a starter in my business Brown Skateboard, and I freelance part-time as a graphic designer by doing flyers, business cards and much more. Also, I deliver newspaper as part-time too. I will be thrill to get my project in reality.  All these products I need is to sale to customers in person at trade shows and get a property lot in my area that I can only use for 6 months. I came up with my business because I struggle doing college as a graphic designer, and I strive for my goals as I graduated in March 2012. I'm doing this because I believe some of us wants to follow our goals, dreams, passion in what we do in our lives.</p>

I am a starter in my business Brown Skateboard, and I freelance part-time as a graphic designer by doing flyers, business cards and much more. Also, I deliver newspaper as part-time too. I will be thrill to get my project in reality.  All these products I need is to sale to customers in person at trade shows and get a property lot in my area that I can only use for 6 months. I came up with my business because I struggle doing college as a graphic designer, and I strive for my goals as I graduated in March 2012. I'm doing this because I believe some of us wants to follow our goals, dreams, passion in what we do in our lives.

<p>An evolution of the original Scrubba wash bag, the lightweight stealth pack offers greater functionality for travellers, outdoor adventurers, and eco-commuters by combining the signature internal washboard with several new features to enable innovative stealth functions for: </p>
<ul>
<li>washing clothes anywhere</li>
<li>keeping gear dry</li>
<li>showering anywhere</li>
<li>packing smaller</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499339489/sdywzcxbqlvywjrfzthh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Outdoor enthusiasts can now do more with less by using just one lightweight bag to protect their gear from the elements, compress down bulky items like jackets and sleeping bags, and even wash their clothing and themselves, absolutely anywhere. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499339544/gmsd0btcuwjhuvvb20i3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Keeping gear protected from rain and dry at the beach, the stealth pack is the ideal backpack for travellers. At night, it can be used to wash clothing in just minutes, saving money while reducing luggage size. The Scrubba stealth pack can also be used as a convenient carry-on bag, or can be packed down small thanks to the compression function.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499340336/ejfi06tffqava6eqklxl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A durable, weatherproof backpack spacious enough to accommodate daily essentials and most laptop sizes, the stealth pack is ideal for commuters who are routinely exposed to the elements.  </p>

<p>The 40 denier, TPU coated nylon fabric works in conjunction with the weatherproof seal to protect your gear from whatever the elements - or your adventures - might throw at it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Washing machine function - wash clothes anywhere</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/aQBq0qSER8edi/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Equipped with our signature flexible, internal washboard, the stealth pack is able to provide a machine-quality wash anywhere in just minutes. Simply add water and cleaning liquid, roll down the top and seal the bag, remove air through the twist-valve, and rub for 30 seconds to 3 minutes. After a quick rinse in the bag, clothing is ready to dry.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Minimise your luggage and maximise your travels! The Scrubba stealth pack's XL twist-style valve works with the shoulder straps to compress gear. Simply fill with clothing, roll and clip, expel air via the valve, wrap and clip the shoulder straps, and pack and go.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Camp shower function - shower anywhere</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>We have received many suggestions from the travelling community regarding a  neutral-coloured, larger wash bag capable of washing higher volumes at once, and are therefore confident that the Scrubba stealth pack's increased capacity and 'stealth' black colour fill a much-needed gap in the outdoor market. The Scrubba stealth pack is the outcome of our desire to add a little extra to the ordinary by creating a product that does it all, and we have innovated in accordance with our supporters' needs to ensure that our products evolve and continue to provide the best, most practical solutions for travellers everywhere. </p>
<p>We are hoping to raise $5000 from the campaign, giving us the confidence to proceed with the first production run.  We already have the materials ready, we just need the green light from you. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is our fifth crowdfunding campaign in the span of five years. Despite hurdles along the way, we have completed and fulfilled our previous four campaigns within only a few months, and from these experiences have learned how best to increase our overall efficiency. We therefore have great confidence that we will be able to ship most (if not all) Scrubba stealth pack orders within a month of the campaign's close. </p>
<p>Although we do not anticipate any significant set backs or complications, we do believe in honesty and great customer service, so in the unlikely event that a delay does pop up, we will let you know and will quickly provide our strategy for getting back on track. So feel free to jump on-board and see how you can pack smaller and go further with the Scrubba stealth pack. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if the Scrubba stealth pack isn't for you, we still value your input and appreciate your support. That's why we'd love you to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Let your friends and family know about the stealth pack</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word online</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks in advance for spreading the word about our campaign, and please feel free to contact us at info@thescrubba.com if you require further information. </p>
<h3>Our Previous Crowdfunding Success</h3>
<p>In 2012 we revolutionised travel laundry by integrating a flexible washboard into a waterproof bag. By bringing the concept of the washboard into the 21st century, we created a new technology that has since been enjoyed by over 100,000 travellers around the globe. The support we received from the crowdfunding community was overwhelming, and we have been committed to developing lightweight, durable, portable, multi-functional, and environmentally-conscious products ever since: </p>
<p><strong>The Scrubba wash bag (2012):</strong> Crowdfunded on Indiegogo following founder and patent attorney Ash Newland's mission to overcome the difficulty of effectively washing clothes while hiking Mt Kilimanjaro, the Scrubba wash bag ultimately raised 22,525USD of its 2,500USD goal, and has today become a pack favourite across the globe. </p>
<p><strong>The Scrubba W Pack (2015): </strong> A backpack, wash bag and dry bag rolled into one, the W pack ultimately received 27,861USD, smashing its Indiegogo goal by 123%. </p>
<p><strong>The Scrubba weightless wallet (2016): </strong>Crowdfunded late last year with a final pledge result of 18,385AUD, this 7g (~0.25oz) water- and sweat-resistant travel and active wallet is 100% upcycled using excess material from the Scrubba wash bag. Finishing its Kickstarter run in early October 2016, all pledges had been fulfilled and shipped by early December.</p>
<p><strong>The Allurette washer (2017):</strong> Having completed its Indiegogo run in March of this year, we were thrilled to have all original pledges shipped by mid-April. The Allurette washer continued to receive great support on our InDemand campaign until its conclusion in May, and ultimately received 16,485USD of its 5000USD goal. </p>
<p>Thanks so much for your support and enthusiasm.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>How does the Scrubba stealth pack differ from the Scrubba W pack? </strong></p>
<p>In addition to switching out our vivid Scrubba green fabric for a neutral black that allows for increased discreetness, the Scrubba stealth pack is 40% larger, enabling it to easily carry more gear and to more effectively wash bulkier items. The Scrubba stealth pack also carries an array of updates that improve upon our original design, and is thus a more technical backpack that has been built specially for the outdoors. The old squeeze valve located on our W pack has been replaced with an XL twist-style mechanism to allow for easier compression and greater versatility, while the shoulder straps have been upgraded for maximum comfort and durability. The stealth pack also features a square base for increased accessibility, along with gear loops for the convenient attachment of small outdoor accessories and a side handle for maximum portability. </p>
<p><strong>Just how multi-functional is the Scrubba stealth pack? </strong></p>
<p>We are passionate about creating multi-functional items that can be helpfully adapted in a multitude of ways to increase productivity in both urban jungles and rural environments. Although the primary uses of the Scrubba stealth pack are as a high-quality backpack, wash bag, compression dry bag, and camp shower, we have received much feedback over the years in relation to a diverse range of impressive uses for our products, bound to suit all travellers' needs. These include filling the pack with clothing, either to use as a makeshift pillow or to provide a soft environment that is ideal for transporting delicate items and souvenirs, and filling with ice for use as a makeshift ice pack/bag. Removing the stealth pack's detachable shoulder straps can afford even greater versatility, enabling the pack to be compactly stored in a larger case for use as a packing cell or laundry bag that separates dirty clothes from clean ones. </p>
<p><strong>How does the Scrubba stealth pack wash clothes?</strong></p>
<p>The Scrubba stealth pack works on the same principle as an old-fashion washboard, and functions in an identical manner to our earlier Scrubba wash bag and W pack products. To wash a load of clothing, you need simply add clothes, water, and your preferred detergent to the appropriate marking level indicated on the bag's exterior, roll down the top seal and clip the ends together, twist open the valve to remove excess air, seal the valve, and then rub clothes against the internal washboard for 30 seconds - 3 minutes. You can monitor the washing process via the pack's clear viewing window. When clothes are clean, you need simply unseal the bag, replace the dirty water with fresh water, reseal without deflating, give the bag a firm shake to rinse off residual detergent, and then remove and hang the clothes to dry. </p>
<p><strong>How can I use the stealth pack as a camp shower? </strong></p>
<p>When hung from a tree and clipped upside down using one of the shoulder straps, the Scrubba stealth pack's XL valve is capable of releasing a slow, steady stream of water. This transforms it into makeshift, outdoor shower that is perfect for overnight treks, camping out in the wilderness, or quickly rinsing off after a trip to the beach. Simply fill the bag with 4-6 litres (1-1.5 gal) of water, roll and clip the opening, and twist open the valve to wash off the sweat of a long day. You can even use the valve to adjust the water flow as you shower.  </p>
<p><strong>How can I use the stealth pack as a compression bag? </strong></p>
<p>Although the stealth pack makes for an ideal piece of carry-on baggage, we understand that everyone travels differently and that some travellers may prefer a different type of carry-on/day bag. To ensure that the stealth pack remains beneficial for these people, we have included a compression feature that enables you to downsize your luggage in order to avoid a bulky, disorganised suitcase. The Scrubba stealth pack's XL twist-style valve enables the bag to compress down for maximum storage and portability, allowing you to always implement the most efficient packing strategy. Simply load the stealth pack with gear, roll and clip the top, release the air via the valve, and tighten the straps around the bag to cinch everything in place and ensure it remains as compressed as possible throughout your journey. Then insert your compressed bag into a larger suitcase or backpack to benefit from smaller, lighter luggage. This method is also great for keeping gear neat and organised throughout your travels, preventing you from losing sight of that one, pesky sock!</p>
<p><strong>Should I use the stealth pack as a compression bag or as carry-on luggage?</strong></p>
<p>The choice is yours! If you already have a favourite carry-on bag or struggle to find efficient methods for packing your suitcase, the compression feature could suit you. However, if you plan on using the Scrubba stealth pack as your day bag throughout your trip, and only require a basic backpack for your flight, using the stealth pack as a carry-on is likely your best option. As the stealth pack fits most laptop sizes and offers 21L of capacity, it is a handy piece of gear to take along on your flight, but the best feature is its adaptability, so you can variously use it as a carry-on bag, day bag, compression bag, or even as a packing cell or laundry bag, depending on what suits your needs at any given time. </p>
<p><strong>What are the dimensions of the Scrubba stealth pack?</strong></p>
<p>The stealth pack has a maximum capacity of 21L and measures 54cm x 32cm (21 x 13') when laid flat.  However, as the washing method requires you to seal the bag and rub the clothes against the washboard from the outside, the optimal working volume for the washing process is around 2-8L (0.5-2 GAL).  The markings on the front of the pack make it easy to always add the right volumes. </p>
<p><strong>Is the stealth pack waterproof?</strong></p>
<p>The Scrubba stealth pack is made from the same durable, waterproof material as our Scrubba wash bag and W packs, using the same manufacturing method. In this regard, the pack provides great protection from rain, snow, and the like. However, we would not recommend submerging the pack entirely, as water can escape through the seal from time to time. In this regard, the stealth pack is weatherproof and water-resistant, but is not totally waterproof and should therefore not be fully submerged if it is loaded with contents that cannot be exposed to water. </p>
<p><strong>What is the stealth pack made from? </strong></p>
<p>The stealth pack is made from a durable 40 denier nylon fabric with a polyurethane coating to ensure maximum style, comfort, and durability. </p>
<p><strong>How long does a load take to wash in the Scrubba stealth pack?</strong></p>
<p>For a machine quality wash, we recommend using a few drops of washing detergent and then rubbing the clothes against the washboard for 2-3 minutes. For stubborn stains, the clothing may be rubbed for longer and/or allowed to soak in the stealth pack prior to rubbing. If soaking clothing in the stealth pack, ensure it is stored upright (e.g. seal facing upwards) to prevent water wicking through the seal.</p>
<p><strong>Are the straps adjustable and removable?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The straps can be fully adjusted according to your own preference, and can be removed as needed, giving you the flexibility to travel in a way that suits you. </p>
<p><strong>How much luggage will fit in the stealth pack?</strong></p>
<p>The stealth pack is a 21L backpack that is capable of holding most of the gear you would typically need for flights or basic day trips. It can accommodate most laptop sizes and has plenty of room left over for necessities including passports and wallets. The gear loops afford additional storage space, enabling small items like raincoats or drink bottles to be attached to the outside of the pack, freeing up space within. </p>
<p><strong>How much clothing can be washed in the Scrubba stealth pack at once? </strong></p>
<p>The Scrubba stealth pack can accommodate plenty of gear when used as a backpack, but washing efficiency may be compromised if too much clothing is added during the washing process, so we recommend limiting the amount of items you wash together. With 40% larger capacity than the Scrubba wash bag, the stealth pack can typically wash about 3 t-shirts, a couple of pairs of socks, and a couple of pairs of underwear at once. Bulkier items, like jeans and jumpers/sweaters, should be washed separately for the best results. The recommended working volume is 2-8L (0.5-2 GAL), and the fill level markings on the bag's exterior will help you to determine the appropriate water levels in relation to different sized loads. </p>
<p><strong>Can I use hot water in the Scrubba stealth pack?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the waterproof lining of the bag, we recommend that water no hotter than 50°C (122°F) be used. Simply put, if it is too hot to hold your hands in, the water is too hot for the Scrubba stealth pack.</p>
<p><strong>How can I dry the Scrubba stealth pack after use? </strong><br/>To expedite the drying process and achieve the best level of hygiene, we recommend removing the straps and turning the Scrubba stealth pack inside out after use.  When inverted, you can make good use of the clips to hang the bag to dry.</p>
<p><strong>What cleaning liquid should I use in the Scrubba stealth pack?</strong></p>
<p>We've found the use of liquid detergents to be more efficient, as they, unlike solid detergents (powders, leaves etc.), do not require additional time to dissolve. Using a liquid also enables active suds immediately, reducing the overall washing time. For ultra-lightweight travellers, a small dollop of 3-in-1 bodywash-shampoo-shave liquid may be used, as we have found that this typically works well in refreshing clothes.You can test for quantities of different cleaning products in the stealth pack by checking the amount of suds visible through the clear section of the bag. If you still have suds after 30 seconds of rubbing, you can probably reduce the amount of detergent for the next load. Optimising the amount is not only better for the environment, but will also minimise the amount of rinsing required. Avoid the use of detergents containing harsh chemicals, bleach, or ammonia, as these ingredients will reduce the Scrubba stealth pack's longevity.</p>
<p><strong>How long will the Scrubba stealth pack last and how do I care for it?</strong></p>
<p>The Scrubba stealth pack has been built to last, but you can take some small steps to ensure maximum longevity. These include avoiding contact with sharp objects that could puncture the fabric during the washing process, and avoiding washing with strong bleaches, on abrasive surfaces, and at high temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>How do I dry my clothes after using the Scrubba stealth pack?</strong></p>
<p>After rinsing the clothing, gently squeeze the excess water from your garments. You can then either hang the clothes to dry as normal or, to expedite the drying process, lay the wet garments on a clean, dry towel, before rolling up the towel to encase the clothes. Press down on the rolled-up towel to encourage water absorption, then hang the damp clothes to dry.</p>

An evolution of the original Scrubba wash bag, the lightweight stealth pack offers greater functionality for travellers, outdoor adventurers, and eco-commuters by combining the signature internal washboard with several new features to enable innovative stealth functions for: 

washing clothes anywhere
keeping gear dry
showering anywhere
packing smaller

The Scrubba stealth pack can also be used as a convenient carry-on bag, or can be packed down small thanks to the compression function.

A durable, weatherproof backpack spacious enough to accommodate daily essentials and most laptop sizes, the stealth pack is ideal for commuters who are routinely exposed to the elements.

<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">At Ponderosa Lodge, it's our goal to bring students one-step closer to Jesus. To do this, we use every tool at our disposal: counselor, games, forum time, and even recreation.

<ul>
<li>9-Square is great game that we've seen played at other camps and would love to offer our students. It's like 4-square, but with 9, and in the air!</li>
<li>Spikeball is a perfect afternoon activity for the field or the beach and is good for hours of entertainment.</li>
<li>The new foam dodgeballs we hope to purchase will be much safer than traditional rubber dodgeballs, and we know camp is much more fun when we're being safe!</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Cost</h3>
<p>To offer all of these new rec options it will cost $1150.</p>
<ul>
<li>9-Square game: $800</li>
<li>2 Spikeball sets: $200</li>
<li>3 foam dodge ball sets (18 balls): $150</li>

<h3>What is Alternative Spring Break?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>ASB is an entirely student-led organization at Ryerson University that fundraises to send students abroad to work on International development projects. Active since 2006, ASB has sent dozens of Ryerson students abroad to help better the lives of those less fortunate and to grow both personally and professionally by gaining a better understanding of global issues. </p>
<p>ASB believes that these trips can foster positive change both in our own community and abroad. Changing the world in small steps by encouraging students to change themselves.</p>
<h3>Who is Team Uganda?</h3>
<p>This May, 20 students will embark on ASB’s tenth project abroad, to Villa Maria, Uganda. In partnership with a local NGO, ASB will assist in rebuilding a medical clinic, help at the local orphanage, and participate in several other community projects.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What does ASB need?</h3>
<p>ASB projects are volunteer-based, and, as a result, fundraising is a vital component of sustainable development projects abroad, as well as of the ASB organization. </p>
<p><b>Our goal for this campaign is $1020. Ten. Twenty.</b></p>
<p>Ten represents this as our tenth project abroad and twenty represents the twenty team members who will participate!</p>
<h3>How will you benefit?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Emily and Caitlin are two of the twenty team members and are both film students at Ryerson University. To assist in both promoting and capturing ASB's journey, they will create a film while abroad. Your generous support DOES NOT go towards the making of the film. The money will assist the team in travelling to Uganda, as well as provide support for future ASB teams to volunteer with different projects.</p>
<p>Donating to this campaign allows you the unique opportunity to be a part of the making of the film that will encapsulate Team Uganda's journey!</p>

ASB is an entirely student-led organization at Ryerson University that fundraises to send students abroad to work on International development projects. Active since 2006, ASB has sent dozens of Ryerson students abroad to help better the lives of those less fortunate and to grow both personally and professionally by gaining a better understanding of global issues. 
ASB believes that these trips can foster positive change both in our own community and abroad. Changing the world in small steps by encouraging students to change themselves.
Who is Team Uganda?
This May, 20 students will embark on ASB’s tenth project abroad, to Villa Maria, Uganda. In partnership with a local NGO, ASB will assist in rebuilding a medical clinic, help at the local orphanage, and participate in several other community projects.

What does ASB need?
ASB projects are volunteer-based, and, as a result, fundraising is a vital component of sustainable development projects abroad, as well as of the ASB organization. 
Our goal for this campaign is $1020. Ten. Twenty.
Ten represents this as our tenth project abroad and twenty represents the twenty team members who will participate!
How will you benefit?

Emily and Caitlin are two of the twenty team members and are both film students at Ryerson University. To assist in both promoting and capturing ASB's journey, they will create a film while abroad. Your generous support DOES NOT go towards the making of the film. The money will assist the team in travelling to Uganda, as well as provide support for future ASB teams to volunteer with different projects.
Donating to this campaign allows you the unique opportunity to be a part of the making of the film that will encapsulate Team Uganda's journey!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jon. my wife and I play softball for the local park district, coach my 14 year old sons traveling little league baseball team, as well as Father of an 11 year old avid soccer player.  Living in the midwest we are often cursed with rain out games. Last year my sons baseball team had to make-up multiple games due to flooding of the fields from rain.  In one occurance, the team drove 30 miles only to find out that the fields had too many puddles to play.

My name is Jon. my wife and I play softball for the local park district, coach my 14 year old sons traveling little league baseball team, as well as Father of an 11 year old avid soccer player.  Living in the midwest we are often cursed with rain out games. Last year my sons baseball team had to make-up multiple games due to flooding of the fields from rain.  In one occurance, the team drove 30 miles only to find out that the fields had too many puddles to play. It was sunny that day but the sun was not enough.  It was then that my son asked me if there was a way to get rid of the water. After researching this question, I had found that their was not any solution to this problem. I could not help but think, with all of the golf courses, softball fields, baseball fields, soccer fields etc.... why nobody has come up with a machine to solve this issue. Well, now there is.  With all of your help, we as parents, don't have to see the disappointment in our children's eyes on gameday.  Not to mention, our disappointment in having to reschedule our tee times.

<div>Last September our family made a big move, and began commuting from Nashville to Cincinnati so our youngest daughter could follow a dream and train at one of the top gyms in the U.S. , Cincinnati Gymnastics.   </div>
<div>This year I would like to continue the tradition of our once a year campaign and offer my photography skills again. I am excited that I can offer this perk  to you and your family .</div><div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">A little about Grace</b><br/>
</div><div>Grace is the youngest of our three girls. She  turned 11 this summer and started gymnastics 3 years ago in Nashville, after periods of climbing the furniture and dancing around the living room. At the time she was taking a tumbling  class and her teacher, my friend Graham a former college gymnast, told us to get her to a gym!  We utilized our local resources but after a couple years realized that Grace's love for the sport, her long term goals, and  physical abilities led us to research other options and Cincinnati Gymnastics was a perfect fit. It was a big transition for our family but we've made it work, day by day and week by week and our Indiegogo campaign in 2013 was one of the main reasons everything went so smoothly.  I thank you guys so much for donating as we reached our goal! It allowed us the funds to travel, meet fees and helped with tuition.  Grace and I were talking just last night about how far we've come since that first night in the LiveInn Hotel almost a year ago.</div><div>She has learned so much from her year in Cincinnati and continues to gain confidence, physical strength, and thrives on the energy she gets from this sport. When we adopted Grace six years ago with her sister, she was a little stick of a girl with rickety legs and a size seven month toddler shoe.. she still has little feet, but alot has changed! I took some video at the end of the summer after some practices for you to see a bit of training. She continues to soak it up like a sponge and loves her coaches.</div><div><br/></div>
<div><b>The Fundraising</b></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We would like to raise funds to help cover  Grace's competition/parent club fees with the balance going to tuition for the year and gas as well as traveling to and from meets. My husband and I each take one trip up a week. We have been incredibly lucky to have been given the opportunity to work part time on a horse farm in the area in exchange for residence in a great old farmhouse. It's a beautiful place for Grace to spend the week and for us to be together as a family when we're all together. </span><br/>
</div>
<div>I am offering  four sessions as perks, holiday card,  the mini session, the full family session and the gold medal, stylized concept shoot. Example videos below.These will come with digital images, and some with prints.  As a photographer, I don't typically include digitals unless purchased singly, so this a great perk if you are a client of mine in either city! Hoping to introduce my work to families in Cincinnati this year now that we're more settled. </div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Last summer, I did not anticipate that I would be living in two cities with three girls in three different school environments, but it has really been an adventure, and so many great things have unfolded, giving opportunities to not only Grace but all of us.  Thank you so much everyone! Please share if you can.</span><br/>

This year I would like to continue the tradition of our once a year campaign and offer my photography skills again. I am excited that I can offer this perk  to you and your family .
A little about Grace
Grace is the youngest of our three girls. She  turned 11 this summer and started gymnastics 3 years ago in Nashville, after periods of climbing the furniture and dancing around the living room. At the time she was taking a tumbling  class and her teacher, my friend Graham a former college gymnast, told us to get her to a gym!  We utilized our local resources but after a couple years realized that Grace's love for the sport, her long term goals, and  physical abilities led us to research other options and Cincinnati Gymnastics was a perfect fit. It was a big transition for our family but we've made it work, day by day and week by week and our Indiegogo campaign in 2013 was one of the main reasons everything went so smoothly.  I thank you guys so much for donating as we reached our goal! It allowed us the funds to travel, meet fees and helped with tuition.  Grace and I were talking just last night about how far we've come since that first night in the LiveInn Hotel almost a year ago.She has learned so much from her year in Cincinnati and continues to gain confidence, physical strength, and thrives on the energy she gets from this sport. When we adopted Grace six years ago with her sister, she was a little stick of a girl with rickety legs and a size seven month toddler shoe.. she still has little feet, but alot has changed! I took some video at the end of the summer after some practices for you to see a bit of training. She continues to soak it up like a sponge and loves her coaches.
The Fundraising

We would like to raise funds to help cover  Grace's competition/parent club fees with the balance going to tuition for the year and gas as well as traveling to and from meets. My husband and I each take one trip up a week. We have been incredibly lucky to have been given the opportunity to work part time on a horse farm in the area in exchange for residence in a great old farmhouse. It's a beautiful place for Grace to spend the week and for us to be together as a family when we're all together. 

I am offering  four sessions as perks, holiday card,  the mini session, the full family session and the gold medal, stylized concept shoot. Example videos below.These will come with digital images, and some with prints.  As a photographer, I don't typically include digitals unless purchased singly, so this a great perk if you are a client of mine in either city! Hoping to introduce my work to families in Cincinnati this year now that we're more settled. 

Last summer, I did not anticipate that I would be living in two cities with three girls in three different school environments, but it has really been an adventure, and so many great things have unfolded, giving opportunities to not only Grace but all of us.  Thank you so much everyone! Please share if you can.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>BeeLine is a handlebar-mounted device that helps you find your way on a bike. It strips back navigation to the bare basics, turning convention completely on its head and resurfacing your natural instinct to find the way.</p>

<p>Cycling has always been a great way to get around the city, but it came with challenges. Getting lost could make you frustrated, late and even unsafe. Finding your way often meant regularly stopping to check maps or following prescribed instructions that don’t work so well in a chaotic urban environment. Not to mention they spoiled the fun. Then came BeeLine…</p>

<p>At the core of BeeLine is the stripped back concept of fuzzy navigation. In the city, being told which turns to take is a hindrance, not a help, so BeeLine simply points you in the general direction to your destination and tells you the distance to go – no instructions. Imagine a compass that knows where you want to go and points there instead of north.  </p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/777/985/a38e1a8d3da54a33f49f3349bd651170_original.gif?v=1445962303&amp;w=456&amp;fit=max&amp;q=92&amp;s=1f69450b75b48de1dd26f1602a652697"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p>
<p>This makes riding fun again. You become more engaged in your journey and discover all kinds of hidden gems you would never find on the major (and often longer) routes. As you can never take a wrong turn, riding becomes completely stress free. </p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/778/004/63591af88cba239651f21db803d46d31_original.png?v=1445962451&amp;w=456&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=3a509596bcd1cac59d3acadba3cff113"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p>
<p>It’s also safer. By being free to take turns that feel safe, when they feel safe and never being pushed into certain junctions or routes that you don’t feel comfortable. Checking how you’re doing just takes a quick glance leaving you free to focus on the road and your environment, not looking for street names or working out which is the right turn.</p>
<p>For the occasions where you have to go via a specific point, e.g. a bridge over a river, we’ve built in the option to add intermediate way points to your journey to ensure you never get stuck.</p>

<p>To set BeeLine up, simply snap the device onto your bike, select a destination in the free app and off you go. You can even save frequently used destinations for a one tap service.</p>

<p>BeeLine is as happy off the bike as on it. When not in use, the innovative design protects the screen so it can be thrown in your pocket or bag without worrying about damaging the screen. It also comes with a beautiful aluminium buckle so you you can attach it to your keys when not in use.</p>

<p>BeeLine has been designed in collaboration with Map Project Office, one of London’s top industrial design agencies. As well as thinking hard about the electronics and the software, we’ve spent a huge amount of time on the way BeeLine looks and feels. We hope you love it as much as we do!</p>

<p>Bikes come in as many shapes and sizes as their riders. So we’ve made sure BeeLine fits onto any bike using its flexible strap, and the display can be rotated to work whether attached to the handlebar or stem. With its elegant design, BeeLine is as at home on a battered run-around or a hire bike as it is on a treasured vintage fixie or a lightweight racer.  </p>

<p>You and your bike take the rough with the smooth, so BeeLine does too. BeeLine’s backlit e-paper screen is visible under any conditions. It's weather proof to take on the elements and shock proof so you can put it through the wringer.</p>

<p>In a time when charging devices every day is the norm, BeeLine breaks the mould. With an ultra low power screen and componentry and software optimized for efficiency, it keeps on going. BeeLine will last for 1-3 months of use between charges! (Based on 20-60 minutes of use <i>every day</i>)</p>

<p>Despite all of the above, BeeLine is incredibly affordable. By harnessing the power of your phone, we’ve been able to cut down the cost of the device so we can sell it at a price comparable with a bike light or lock, not a GPS navigation system. All without compromising on quality or looks. On top of that we’ve cut the reward prices to as low as we can possibly afford on Kickstarter. We’re not crowdfunding to make a big margin, we’re here to build a huge community of early adopters who will help us decide what BeeLine will do next…</p>

<p>At its core, BeeLine is about finding your way and exploring. However, it's been designed with versatility in mind at every level. This is why BeeLine uses a fully flexible screen that we can adapt to do much more.</p>
<p>When you don’t need navigation, BeeLine can show you your speed and distance travelled, or simply act as a clock. But this is just the tip of the iceberg…</p>

</div></div>","BeeLine is a handlebar-mounted device that helps you find your way on a bike. It strips back navigation to the bare basics, turning convention completely on its head and resurfacing your natural instinct to find the way.

Cycling has always been a great way to get around the city, but it came with challenges. Getting lost could make you frustrated, late and even unsafe. Finding your way often meant regularly stopping to check maps or following prescribed instructions that don’t work so well in a chaotic urban environment. Not to mention they spoiled the fun. Then came BeeLine…

 A familiar scene for urban cyclists around the world





At the core of BeeLine is the stripped back concept of fuzzy navigation. In the city, being told which turns to take is a hindrance, not a help, so BeeLine simply points you in the general direction to your destination and tells you the distance to go – no instructions. Imagine a compass that knows where you want to go and points there instead of north.  

 
This makes riding fun again. You become more engaged in your journey and discover all kinds of hidden gems you would never find on the major (and often longer) routes. As you can never take a wrong turn, riding becomes completely stress free. 

 
It’s also safer. By being free to take turns that feel safe, when they feel safe and never being pushed into certain junctions or routes that you don’t feel comfortable. Checking how you’re doing just takes a quick glance leaving you free to focus on the road and your environment, not looking for street names or working out which is the right turn.
For the occasions where you have to go via a specific point, e.g. a bridge over a river, we’ve built in the option to add intermediate way points to your journey to ensure you never get stuck.

 

 


To set BeeLine up, simply snap the device onto your bike, select a destination in the free app and off you go. You can even save frequently used destinations for a one tap service.

 

 


BeeLine is as happy off the bike as on it. When not in use, the innovative design protects the screen so it can be thrown in your pocket or bag without worrying about damaging the screen. It also comes with a beautiful aluminium buckle so you you can attach it to your keys when not in use.

 


BeeLine has been designed in collaboration with Map Project Office, one of London’s top industrial design agencies. As well as thinking hard about the electronics and the software, we’ve spent a huge amount of time on the way BeeLine looks and feels. We hope you love it as much as we do!

 
To keep things fresh, BeeLine is available in a range of colours. Cool grey or something with a bit more flare? What will you go for?



Bikes come in as many shapes and sizes as their riders. So we’ve made sure BeeLine fits onto any bike using its flexible strap, and the display can be rotated to work whether attached to the handlebar or stem. With its elegant design, BeeLine is as at home on a battered run-around or a hire bike as it is on a treasured vintage fixie or a lightweight racer.  

 


You and your bike take the rough with the smooth, so BeeLine does too. BeeLine’s backlit e-paper screen is visible under any conditions. It's weather proof to take on the elements and shock proof so you can put it through the wringer.

 


In a time when charging devices every day is the norm, BeeLine breaks the mould. With an ultra low power screen and componentry and software optimized for efficiency, it keeps on going. BeeLine will last for 1-3 months of use between charges! (Based on 20-60 minutes of use every day)



Despite all of the above, BeeLine is incredibly affordable. By harnessing the power of your phone, we’ve been able to cut down the cost of the device so we can sell it at a price comparable with a bike light or lock, not a GPS navigation system. All without compromising on quality or looks. On top of that we’ve cut the reward prices to as low as we can possibly afford on Kickstarter. We’re not crowdfunding to make a big margin, we’re here to build a huge community of early adopters who will help us decide what BeeLine will do next…


 
At its core, BeeLine is about finding your way and exploring. However, it's been designed with versatility in mind at every level. This is why BeeLine uses a fully flexible screen that we can adapt to do much more.
When you don’t need navigation, BeeLine can show you your speed and distance travelled, or simply act as a clock. But this is just the tip of the iceberg…

 Some of the functionality BeeLine will ship with on day 1

That versatile little screen is capable of so much more, and this is where you come in. By backing us you’ll become part of our BeeLine owners’ community, which we’ll turn to to help decide future features. Join us and tell us what you want BeeLine to do next! (We don’t really like turn-by-turn navigation, but if the community tells us that’s what you want, we’ll make it).

We wanted to maximize the flavor, scent, and smoothness of coffee and cold brew with Pebble bottle. By extracting the coffee in a sealed container, the flavor and scent remain encapsulated in Pebble bottle so that you can enjoy your cold brew to the fullest extent whenever you want.We've made it easy to use and easy to clean so that you can easily fall in love with Pebble bottle. We designed Pebble bottle with the goal of allowing cold brew fanatics to brew and drink anywhere.The Pebble bottle is a 3 in 1 flask that can be used to brew coffee and tea, make fruit infused water, all in an insulated container. Let the Pebble bottle adapt to your needs.  ① Simple Brewing (Hot or Cold Brew and Loose Leaf Tea) ② Vacuum Insulation ③ Overall Design ④ Hidden Compartment ⑤ Double Micron Filter    
Coffee brewing recommendations (1:5 water/coffee ratio)
Zero contact with air starting from the brewing process to the moment you begin drinking allows your coffee or tea to retain its flavor over a long period of time
Keep everything clean before, during and after the extraction
   The use of high-quality filters reduces the remaining fine coffee powder for a clean and refreshing taste! Introducing the real ""Cold"" Brew coffee which is extracted right into our thermal vacuum bottle which allows your coffee to remain at the perfect temperature all day long. A 1:5 coffee to water ratio will produce a strong brew of about 350 - 410 ml. If you want to make a larger patch, simply adjust the coffee to water ratio to 1:3 and dilute it by adding additional water when you serve. This allows you to make up to 7 cups of coffee with a single brew! 1. Put the ground coffee in the filter and add Water in the bottle.2. Put it in the fridge for 10-12 Hours.3. Remove the filter from the Pebble Bottle.4. Enjoy your Coffee.    The Pebble bottle is also perfect for tea extraction. You can enjoy refreshing tea flavor by not getting any tea sediment during the tea extraction.Tea BrewingFruits Infusion                                 Domestic Shipping :We will be manufacturing and shipping from South Korea.

<p>Aim of
this invention is to mechanically reproduce the jaw movements on a maximum
range of precision. Thanks to a mechanical structure simulating the real jaw
movement of any patient, it is possible to construct a dental prosthesis of a

the number of tests applied on the patient as you will have always with you the
jaw movement of the patient.</p>
<p><b>The function</b></p>
<p>The
movement simulator is composed by a metallic structure created for moving the
plaster cast of the patient's jaw. This structure strictly coincides with the
reference point<span>  taken in the jaw, with 6
axis of motion x,y,z, so that any rotation for every single axis can replaces the movement.</span></p>
<p><b>How to record the mandibular movement</b></p>
<p>At

<p>The
movement collected data is transferred on a pc, and the pc will give the
movement information to the robot. There are two casts of patient’s<span>  jaw (upper and lower): the upper cast is fix,
only the lower one will be moved.</span></p>
<p><b>The idea.</b></p>
<p>One day,
in a dental laboratory we got some troubles for the elaboration of a difficult
prosthesis in an irritable patient. The best solution would have been to have
always with us, at the lab, the mandibular movements of the patient.</p>
<p><b>Future</b></p>
<p>I think
this robot will create a real revolution of a dental technology, because it
will draw a new standard of work for this sector. Labs and patients will have a
prosthesis on a very lower price, a shorter time, and a higher quality. I am
sure we can open a new goal for the community.</p>

<h3>Cliff Notes</h3>
<p>Like many of you I have always loved camping and hiking the outdoors, that is partly what drew me to join the Army as a Special Forces recruit back in 2003. I spent a lot of time training in the outdoors with my most memorable trip being to the Yukon in 2008. We arrived at the perfect time and it was still warm enough to bivouac under the stars and northern lights. Oh how the sky danced that night!</p>
<p>As I have aged I have noticed that my ability to find comfort on any surface has been severely diminished. It is also very difficult to pack a family into a bivouac and keep sane! Many of you may be familiar with one of the most important items for military personal as well, communication. I had these elements in mind when I started my search for something better than the simple tent for our outdoor adventures. It was very important for me to meet the goals of sustainability, mobility, connectivity and leisure comfort.</p>
<p>The Recreational Vehicle (RV) has the ability to meet all of these goals as it provides the amenities of climate control, a solid roof over our head, and even a comfy bed. I was all set to find an RV our family likes and then a conflict started in my soul. There was no option that met my goal of sustainability without giving up other aspects of RVing I love like the comfort of indoor leisure space and a full service kitchen. On top of that conflict all the best tech gadgets for RVing had to be added as an aftermarket add-on that created confusion and more work to install. I consider myself pretty handy, having grown up working in the family home construction business, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money on an RV and then spend a lot of time getting it just the way I wanted.</p>
<p>Later that year I started playing hockey on our coed league team, the IceHawks, with some very talented guys that provided some skills I thought were ideal to meet my issues with current RVs head on. Josh is an alternative fuels technician and installs Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) on fleet vehicles and CJ is a mechanic and fabricator with a passion for excellence. Josh's skill in CNG would address the largest part of my sustainability quest by reducing the emissions on the motor that transports the RV to the campsite. CJ's skill in fabrication helped us to dial in our Class A motorhome plans and assists with the technical side of executing our design. </p>
<p>Our unique and talented team will achieve success in bringing this dream to reality but you can help. Every donation no matter how small will give us fuel to prove to the accelerator we are participating in that we are worthy of further resources. It will also give us confidence that the time and personal resources we are dedicating to this concept is worth the sacrifices we make. If you find yourself wishing you did not have to add aftermarket gadgets to your RV to get it dialed in and wish your RV polluted less and required less maintenance ask yourself this: Can you see your family in a Gäshawk motorhome?</p>
<h3>The Journey Matters</h3>
<p>We have all heard the phrase but what does it mean. To me it means that we learn incredible amounts of things on our journey that it becomes part of who we are. I had a team member that worked with the fuel I thought would be perfect for a sustainable motorhome but did not know much else about this fuel. We quickly realized this same fuel could also supply fuel to our climate control systems and full service kitchen so we no longer needed to lug around and fuel up a propane tank. Josh educated us on the many benefits of using this clean burning fuel such as we would spend 25% less time and money maintaining the engine because it was so clean burning. CNG fills up at a pump much like gasoline and diesel and fills in roughly the same time so it does not have the issues electric vehicles have. CJ has family that has worked in the RV business for years and we were located 20 miles from the RV capital of the world so we were off and running.</p>
<p>We entered a local competition at the University of Notre Dame called the McCloskey Business Plan competition. This competition provided some great resources and mentors from one of the most prestigious business schools in the nation! The structure of the competition helped us do our first survey and come up with a compelling business plan to reach our goal of building our first prototype. The first thing we learned from this competition is that building a prototype RV is not cheap, we really didn't think it would be but the engineering, possible patent process and time needed to build it out was a daunting mountain laid out before us. We also learned that there were lots  of great ideas coming out of the University of Notre Dame and ours would not make the finals. This would not be my first mountain to climb as I was stationed in Alaska for quite some time and love to hike. We knew we just needed to put one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p>Our survey showed that people generally are open to CNG but are not aware of the availability of this fuel. The great thing is that a lot of people use natural gas in their homes and we can design an RV that fuels up at home. We can also use existing tech to update a navigation system to have all CNG stations plotted on a given route so this would help our target customers find their fuel. A few things were glaringly obvious from our survey; people wanted quality craftsmanship, better internet connectivity, standard tech built into their RV and to spend less time maintaining their RV. This last one should be obvious as we all want to spend more time enjoying the outdoors rather than tinkering on an engine!</p>
<p>We received lots of feedback from our McCloskey mentors that we needed to focus on the luxury RV market and find things to make CNG more ""sexy"". Not sure what many of you think as I don't find any fuel ""sexy"" but I had to admit that Tesla sure did make souped up electric cars sexy. A local business owner let me drive his Tesla Model S a few years back and I remembered that experience vividly. This car had handles that popped out when I walked up to it. It unlocked as I grasped the handles and hummed to life as I sat down. The car had a huge display screen with a beautiful backup camera but it also displayed all the systems on an intuitive dashboard. The car vibrated if I got close to the white line on the side of the road and assisted me with every aspect of driving that I could imagine. Oh yeah it also almost made my skin peel off when I stomped on the accelerator when my friend told me to.</p>
<p>This formidable experience with a true luxury car is what inspired our shift from merely a CNG RV to the smart way to RV that we now have in our concept RV. We want to make your experience with our RV last a lifetime and help you juggle your busy family and professional life. We are not reinventing the wheel here, we have just found a better way to turn it. Keep reading to learn more!</p>
<h3>Visions of Taking Flight</h3>
<p>So you have and overview on why we are undertaking this endeavor but how will it change the landscape of RVs out there on the market. I have been told that the best way to communicate this is to tell a story about our fictional fanatical customer, John. Any similarities to any person living or deceased is purely coincidental.</p>
<p>Our fictional friend is an avid outdoors athlete and travels with his RV to triathlon competitions as well as other sporting venues. John also has a busy day as a fund manager for a large national mutual fund company. John is preparing for his next competition and has a few days left before he hits the road, so he checks his app to see how ready the RV is to travel. The app lets him know that the fuel is topped off, water is good to go, and the black tank is empty. The app gives him a readout that estimates he could be ready to hit the road in 1 hour and 30 mins after arriving home based on his last monitored departure. The app does remind him that food stores have not been stocked yet and neither has his race bike, wet suit or his clothing as the closet and bike storage are empty.</p>
<p>That reminds John that he must pick up his bike from the shop as some new tires were being fitted. A few days later John is departing after having fully stocked his RV, the app quietly records the time it took him to stock and outfit the RV for travel, since John had stored the bike the day before and had a list of groceries to pick up on the way home he was able to hit the road in 45 mins! The navigation system plots all of Johns favorite stops for getting CNG fuel on the way to his destination and gives reminders to points of interest he may like.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at his destination John is relieved to have his docking checklist pop up on his integrated system monitor as he quickly sets up camp. The system reminds him that this campground installed natural gas utilities for his campsite earlier this year! When John is done with the docking checklist the integrated system monitor displays a summary of all the important systems on the dashboard. John decides to do a quick run the next morning to check out the course and get used to the atmosphere. When John leaves his RV the next morning the system has already learned how to lock the doors after he has left range of the Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>John’s run was invigorating, and he wore his fitness tracker to monitor his stats. As he arrives back at his RV the data is automatically uploaded to his computer inside, so he can look it over. He was 2 mins slower on this run than he wanted, and he has some great elevation data for the course. He will have to remember that for the race. A couple days later John prepares to leave, he had done better on this race than he had expected and can’t wait for the next one. He is very happy that his undocking checklist walks him through his procedures as he almost forgot that he had been refueling his CNG tank!</p>
<p>Before he finishes the undocking, he is pleased to see a Facetime call is coming in from his wife and daughter as they were not able to make it to this race. John casts the call up to his large flat screen so he can better see the reactions as he relays the past events. When John is done with his call he picks up where he left off on his undocking list and quickly sets about to getting on the road. After dumping his tank and setting off down the highway his system pops up with a warning that a belt is failing thanks to the strategically placed IoT sensors. The system recommends a service schedule or offers to order the belt to be delivered to the home address. John elects to have service done as he has quite a full week ahead of him at the office and he lives close to his trusted service technician.</p>
<h3>Milestones and Swag</h3>
<p>As we mentioned, building a revolutionary coach is not cheap! We have broken down the overall goal of building our prototype into achievable milestones. Our first goal of raising $25,000 will showcase our validation to allow for further funding, and start our engineering process for the prototype. Reaching $100,000 will allow us to fully refurbish the used RV we plan on buying later this year. Reaching a stretch goal of $300,000 would allow us to build our basic prototype with the assistance of a local manufacturer. These numbers do assume that the majority of our funds raised are through swag orders as we cannot place 100% of those funds toward our goal as we still have to fulfill the orders. Large cash donations and the perks we offer ourselves have a greater impact and would allow us to meet these goals with less donations.</p>
<p>However lets talk about the swag! I have been excitedly working on the swag items for several months now and have focused on companies that share similar values to our own. We want to reward all our supporters and also let them feel good for helping our world out. 4Ocean will pull one pound of trash out of the oceans for each bracelet sold, and they look really cool to boot! Woodchuck USA plants a tree for every item sold and includes a card in the item so you can look your tree up and learn about their efforts!

<h3>A Cleaner Impact</h3>
<p>Our mission is to inspire all generations to engage nature in a responsible manner by building exceptional recreation vehicles. By supporting our cause you will change the dialog in RVs to include a focus on a smart way to RV. You will drive a change in supply channel demand that supports materials such as recycled plastics, aluminium, and paper in addition to sustainable materials like bamboo and hemp. You will also have the added benefit of giving life to the idea of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) engines in motor coach transportation which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions in these vehicles by 90% over diesel and gasoline engines!</p>
<p>While there are many of you that value the importance of reducing carbon dioxide emissions there must also be rewards for your ownership. CNG is such a clean fuel that it rewards our customers by reducing maintenance by a projected 25% or $2,000 a year! This is achieved by leaving less harmful deposits in the engine. Just think of what those harmful deposits from the other engines are doing to our air quality. In many places like California you will also save around $100 per fill up at the pump. And we have only talked about the platform that this smart RV is built on! By including the internet of things into your vehicle you will be able to drastically conserve resources, save time, and stay connected with those you love.</p>
<h3>Headwinds</h3>
<p>Every disruptive technology comes with its own specific challenges. Electric vehicle adoption you may recognize has been difficult due to charging times and a lack of infrastructure. Elon Musk and Tesla have overcome this with high technology systems and increasing infrastructure of their rapid charging stations. CNG does not share EV's issues with refueling times as a CNG vehicle can be refueled in the same time as diesel and gasoline. However CNG based vehicles face limited infrastructure for refueling and in cases, Montana and parts of the Dakotas, no stations at all. We will take a similar tact and address this issue through the use of technology as well as a campaign to increase availability of CNG stations near areas of interest for our customers.</p>
<p>CNG is not such a new fuel source that it will keep you out of your favorite places for long. After all most major delivery companies have made commitments to change the majority of their trucks to CNG over the next few years. There are currently 964 CNG stations in the United States and Canada with many more planned in the coming months! Check out the Alternative Fuel Data Center for these locations! It is also important to visit CNG Now if you are curious about how the fuel works and to learn more about programs that promote the adoption of this trending fuel.</p>

Like many of you I have always loved camping and hiking the outdoors, that is partly what drew me to join the Army as a Special Forces recruit back in 2003. I spent a lot of time training in the outdoors with my most memorable trip being to the Yukon in 2008. We arrived at the perfect time and it was still warm enough to bivouac under the stars and northern lights. Oh how the sky danced that night!
As I have aged I have noticed that my ability to find comfort on any surface has been severely diminished. It is also very difficult to pack a family into a bivouac and keep sane! Many of you may be familiar with one of the most important items for military personal as well, communication. I had these elements in mind when I started my search for something better than the simple tent for our outdoor adventures. It was very important for me to meet the goals of sustainability, mobility, connectivity and leisure comfort.
The Recreational Vehicle (RV) has the ability to meet all of these goals as it provides the amenities of climate control, a solid roof over our head, and even a comfy bed. I was all set to find an RV our family likes and then a conflict started in my soul. There was no option that met my goal of sustainability without giving up other aspects of RVing I love like the comfort of indoor leisure space and a full service kitchen. On top of that conflict all the best tech gadgets for RVing had to be added as an aftermarket add-on that created confusion and more work to install. I consider myself pretty handy, having grown up working in the family home construction business, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money on an RV and then spend a lot of time getting it just the way I wanted.
Later that year I started playing hockey on our coed league team, the IceHawks, with some very talented guys that provided some skills I thought were ideal to meet my issues with current RVs head on. Josh is an alternative fuels technician and installs Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) on fleet vehicles and CJ is a mechanic and fabricator with a passion for excellence. Josh's skill in CNG would address the largest part of my sustainability quest by reducing the emissions on the motor that transports the RV to the campsite. CJ's skill in fabrication helped us to dial in our Class A motorhome plans and assists with the technical side of executing our design. 
Our unique and talented team will achieve success in bringing this dream to reality but you can help. Every donation no matter how small will give us fuel to prove to the accelerator we are participating in that we are worthy of further resources. It will also give us confidence that the time and personal resources we are dedicating to this concept is worth the sacrifices we make. If you find yourself wishing you did not have to add aftermarket gadgets to your RV to get it dialed in and wish your RV polluted less and required less maintenance ask yourself this: Can you see your family in a Gäshawk motorhome?
The Journey Matters
We have all heard the phrase but what does it mean. To me it means that we learn incredible amounts of things on our journey that it becomes part of who we are. I had a team member that worked with the fuel I thought would be perfect for a sustainable motorhome but did not know much else about this fuel. We quickly realized this same fuel could also supply fuel to our climate control systems and full service kitchen so we no longer needed to lug around and fuel up a propane tank. Josh educated us on the many benefits of using this clean burning fuel such as we would spend 25% less time and money maintaining the engine because it was so clean burning. CNG fills up at a pump much like gasoline and diesel and fills in roughly the same time so it does not have the issues electric vehicles have. CJ has family that has worked in the RV business for years and we were located 20 miles from the RV capital of the world so we were off and running.
We entered a local competition at the University of Notre Dame called the McCloskey Business Plan competition. This competition provided some great resources and mentors from one of the most prestigious business schools in the nation! The structure of the competition helped us do our first survey and come up with a compelling business plan to reach our goal of building our first prototype. The first thing we learned from this competition is that building a prototype RV is not cheap, we really didn't think it would be but the engineering, possible patent process and time needed to build it out was a daunting mountain laid out before us. We also learned that there were lots  of great ideas coming out of the University of Notre Dame and ours would not make the finals. This would not be my first mountain to climb as I was stationed in Alaska for quite some time and love to hike. We knew we just needed to put one foot in front of the other.
Our survey showed that people generally are open to CNG but are not aware of the availability of this fuel. The great thing is that a lot of people use natural gas in their homes and we can design an RV that fuels up at home. We can also use existing tech to update a navigation system to have all CNG stations plotted on a given route so this would help our target customers find their fuel. A few things were glaringly obvious from our survey; people wanted quality craftsmanship, better internet connectivity, standard tech built into their RV and to spend less time maintaining their RV. This last one should be obvious as we all want to spend more time enjoying the outdoors rather than tinkering on an engine!
We received lots of feedback from our McCloskey mentors that we needed to focus on the luxury RV market and find things to make CNG more ""sexy"". Not sure what many of you think as I don't find any fuel ""sexy"" but I had to admit that Tesla sure did make souped up electric cars sexy. A local business owner let me drive his Tesla Model S a few years back and I remembered that experience vividly. This car had handles that popped out when I walked up to it. It unlocked as I grasped the handles and hummed to life as I sat down. The car had a huge display screen with a beautiful backup camera but it also displayed all the systems on an intuitive dashboard. The car vibrated if I got close to the white line on the side of the road and assisted me with every aspect of driving that I could imagine. Oh yeah it also almost made my skin peel off when I stomped on the accelerator when my friend told me to.
This formidable experience with a true luxury car is what inspired our shift from merely a CNG RV to the smart way to RV that we now have in our concept RV. We want to make your experience with our RV last a lifetime and help you juggle your busy family and professional life. We are not reinventing the wheel here, we have just found a better way to turn it. Keep reading to learn more!
Visions of Taking Flight
So you have and overview on why we are undertaking this endeavor but how will it change the landscape of RVs out there on the market. I have been told that the best way to communicate this is to tell a story about our fictional fanatical customer, John. Any similarities to any person living or deceased is purely coincidental.
Our fictional friend is an avid outdoors athlete and travels with his RV to triathlon competitions as well as other sporting venues. John also has a busy day as a fund manager for a large national mutual fund company. John is preparing for his next competition and has a few days left before he hits the road, so he checks his app to see how ready the RV is to travel. The app lets him know that the fuel is topped off, water is good to go, and the black tank is empty. The app gives him a readout that estimates he could be ready to hit the road in 1 hour and 30 mins after arriving home based on his last monitored departure. The app does remind him that food stores have not been stocked yet and neither has his race bike, wet suit or his clothing as the closet and bike storage are empty.
That reminds John that he must pick up his bike from the shop as some new tires were being fitted. A few days later John is departing after having fully stocked his RV, the app quietly records the time it took him to stock and outfit the RV for travel, since John had stored the bike the day before and had a list of groceries to pick up on the way home he was able to hit the road in 45 mins! The navigation system plots all of Johns favorite stops for getting CNG fuel on the way to his destination and gives reminders to points of interest he may like.
Upon arriving at his destination John is relieved to have his docking checklist pop up on his integrated system monitor as he quickly sets up camp. The system reminds him that this campground installed natural gas utilities for his campsite earlier this year! When John is done with the docking checklist the integrated system monitor displays a summary of all the important systems on the dashboard. John decides to do a quick run the next morning to check out the course and get used to the atmosphere. When John leaves his RV the next morning the system has already learned how to lock the doors after he has left range of the Wi-Fi.
John’s run was invigorating, and he wore his fitness tracker to monitor his stats. As he arrives back at his RV the data is automatically uploaded to his computer inside, so he can look it over. He was 2 mins slower on this run than he wanted, and he has some great elevation data for the course. He will have to remember that for the race. A couple days later John prepares to leave, he had done better on this race than he had expected and can’t wait for the next one. He is very happy that his undocking checklist walks him through his procedures as he almost forgot that he had been refueling his CNG tank!
Before he finishes the undocking, he is pleased to see a Facetime call is coming in from his wife and daughter as they were not able to make it to this race. John casts the call up to his large flat screen so he can better see the reactions as he relays the past events. When John is done with his call he picks up where he left off on his undocking list and quickly sets about to getting on the road. After dumping his tank and setting off down the highway his system pops up with a warning that a belt is failing thanks to the strategically placed IoT sensors. The system recommends a service schedule or offers to order the belt to be delivered to the home address. John elects to have service done as he has quite a full week ahead of him at the office and he lives close to his trusted service technician.
Milestones and Swag
As we mentioned, building a revolutionary coach is not cheap! We have broken down the overall goal of building our prototype into achievable milestones. Our first goal of raising $25,000 will showcase our validation to allow for further funding, and start our engineering process for the prototype. Reaching $100,000 will allow us to fully refurbish the used RV we plan on buying later this year. Reaching a stretch goal of $300,000 would allow us to build our basic prototype with the assistance of a local manufacturer. These numbers do assume that the majority of our funds raised are through swag orders as we cannot place 100% of those funds toward our goal as we still have to fulfill the orders. Large cash donations and the perks we offer ourselves have a greater impact and would allow us to meet these goals with less donations.
However lets talk about the swag! I have been excitedly working on the swag items for several months now and have focused on companies that share similar values to our own. We want to reward all our supporters and also let them feel good for helping our world out. 4Ocean will pull one pound of trash out of the oceans for each bracelet sold, and they look really cool to boot! Woodchuck USA plants a tree for every item sold and includes a card in the item so you can look your tree up and learn about their efforts! We have partnered with Woodchuck USA on the bottle openers and coaster sets. TenTree is our t-shirt partner* and they have a goal to plant ten trees in an impoverished country for every item sold!

Using the height adjustment strap at either side of the bag, the user can align the backpack to their requirements. You can adjust the flexible back torso, with the easy straps on the back of the bag. It helps you to align the top massagers and the bottom ones, to support areas where you would like a massage. The primary focus of the adjustment straps is the user's shoulder and lower back.Built To Carry With EaseThe Challenge of carrying a heavy sling bag or backpack on a daily basis increases the chances of discomfort and back pain.

It’s not like any other Visitor Information Center. In addition to being a Visitor Information Centre open all year round, we have gone with the Star Trek theme here and through our town of Vulcan. If you have ever been to our town you will have seen our Star ship Enterprise FX6-1995-A on Highway 23 at the entrance to our town, our space station shaped tourist information centre, replica captain's chair and our shuttle craft. We have a collection of Star Trek memorabilia on display of items that a special Trekkie collected through the years and donated to our centre upon his passing. <br/></p>
<p>Our gift shop is unique in that we design, produce and sell our own line of Star Trek gifts that are exclusive to Vulcan Tourism and can only be purchased from us! The money from the gift shop sales are also used to supplement the funding of the Tourism Society in Vulcan. <br/></p>
<p>Our cheerful staff are always willing to help answer questions - whatever they may be! Devan Daniels (Tourism Administrator), Shannon Clarke (Assistant Administrator) and of course our Travel Counsellors Karen, Carlie and Connor!</p>
<p> Over the years, Vulcan Tourism has been successful in hosting an annual festival now known as Spock Days. Each June we host our very own convention and bring up celebrities from Star Trek series and movies as guests. They ride in the lead cars during our Spock Days parade, sign autographs, take pictures with you, and give question and answer sessions. In addition we have a dinner and dance and the town hosts a family fun festival as well with entertainment and fun for the whole family! Spock Days takes place each June.<br/></p>
<p>The Starship replica on the highway was built in 1995 and our tourism centre opened year round in October 1998.  Leonard Nimoy graced us with his presence in 2010 when he visited for the unveiling of Mr. Spock's Bust in our town centre along with Leonard Nimoy's handprint cast in bronze. <br/></p>
<p><b>FUNDING</b><br/></p>
<p>Funding for the Tourism Centre is provided by the Town of Vulcan and Vulcan County. We supplement that funding with our gift shop sales. We also apply for government grants to assist us with the costs necessary to perform all the needed functions Vulcan Tourism is supposed to oversee. With funding cuts everywhere, grants are not as easy to come by and all we are left with is enough funding to pay the wages for the centre for the year, a small amount of advertising and little else.<br/></p>
<p>We usually obtain a grant to assist us with temporary summer employment so that we may hire the staff needed for our 15,000 travellers every year. This year, however, we did not receive any grants to hire summer help due to the fact our provincial government cancelled their grant program putting more pressure on the federal grant program.</p>
<p>This year, sadly, Southern Alberta was hit with a disaster. Severe flooding affected many communities in late June. People lost their entire homes. HIghways and roads were washed out. An entire town of 12,000 had to be evacuated. Tourists were unable to enjoy Southern Alberta for many weeks. This affected our visitorship and the amount of money tourists were spending. Many people simply stayed home and used their resources to help their friends, families and even strangers!  Who could blame them?!!</p>
<p>As a result of all this, our gift shop sales have suffered putting an extra strain on the budget. <br/></p>
<p>There are many things Vulcan Tourism is mandated to do. <br/></p>
<p>We need to design, implement and promote new tourism initiatives for our town and county. <br/></p>
<p>We need to work with neighbouring counties to promote tourism throughout Alberta. <br/></p>
<p>We need to keep our Spock Days festival on track and be able to financially support it.</p>
<p>We need to design, implement and promote community events.</p>
<p>As of present date this year, we have received no government funding. These usually help with the costs of summer staff. With extra summer staff we could have provided a summer camp for preschool and elementary school children.</p>
<p>Without proper funding and staffing, we have to close the Tourism and Trek Station while we are go on conferences, comic cons and training days or to meet with our counterparts in other jurisdictions. Extra funding would provide us with more time for planning tours and day trips within our county and town. New attractions could be added and a community events calendar could be promoted. <br/></p>
<p>With more money we could better advertise our special town and Spock Days weekend which happens annually every second weekend in June. As you might already know getting celebrities is expensive. Talent can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $100,000 plus flights and travel expenses per person! Otherwise we have to bring back repeat celebrities or ""B""  talent. That doesn't always bring back the fans, but if we bring the right person or persons and with the proper advertising, we can improve attendance levels which will increase the economic spinoff. <br/></p>
<p> We would like to raise money for operating costs (30k), and money to book talent for 2014 Spock Days (25k).  We would very much like to Keep one summer staff member for the whole year (15k). We need extra funding to design and implement new tours, community events such as a kid’s science camp (10k), attractions such as refurbishing of the shuttle craft (20 k), and update and maintain the inside of our Trek Station. We would love to have something new for repeat visitors to come and see. We would like to add a Fan Art section that would see art created by the fans on display. The fans' names would be on display and we would showcase the talent of the fans from all over the world! This display could be changed out annually to give other fans an opportunity to have their works on display. We also would like to design a new photo opportunity in our replica Captain's chair. We would also increase the space allocated to community news where each town, village and hamlet in our county would have their own space to advertise all their events. It would be wonderful if we had the money to advertise all these fun things and to improve our revenues.</p>

Many people simply stayed home and used their resources to help their friends, families and even strangers!  Who could blame them?!!
As a result of all this, our gift shop sales have suffered putting an extra strain on the budget. 
There are many things Vulcan Tourism is mandated to do. 
We need to design, implement and promote new tourism initiatives for our town and county. 
We need to work with neighbouring counties to promote tourism throughout Alberta. 
We need to keep our Spock Days festival on track and be able to financially support it.
We need to design, implement and promote community events.
As of present date this year, we have received no government funding. These usually help with the costs of summer staff. With extra summer staff we could have provided a summer camp for preschool and elementary school children.
Without proper funding and staffing, we have to close the Tourism and Trek Station while we are go on conferences, comic cons and training days or to meet with our counterparts in other jurisdictions. Extra funding would provide us with more time for planning tours and day trips within our county and town. New attractions could be added and a community events calendar could be promoted. 
With more money we could better advertise our special town and Spock Days weekend which happens annually every second weekend in June. As you might already know getting celebrities is expensive. Talent can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $100,000 plus flights and travel expenses per person! Otherwise we have to bring back repeat celebrities or ""B""  talent. That doesn't always bring back the fans, but if we bring the right person or persons and with the proper advertising, we can improve attendance levels which will increase the economic spinoff. 
 We would like to raise money for operating costs (30k), and money to book talent for 2014 Spock Days (25k).  We would very much like to Keep one summer staff member for the whole year (15k). We need extra funding to design and implement new tours, community events such as a kid’s science camp (10k), attractions such as refurbishing of the shuttle craft (20 k), and update and maintain the inside of our Trek Station. We would love to have something new for repeat visitors to come and see. We would like to add a Fan Art section that would see art created by the fans on display. The fans' names would be on display and we would showcase the talent of the fans from all over the world! This display could be changed out annually to give other fans an opportunity to have their works on display. We also would like to design a new photo opportunity in our replica Captain's chair. We would also increase the space allocated to community news where each town, village and hamlet in our county would have their own space to advertise all their events. It would be wonderful if we had the money to advertise all these fun things and to improve our revenues.

<h1><b>Why Crowdfunding?  </b></h1>
<p>When travel and commerce are a part of your daily life, you may concern yourself with someone stealing your belongings, your phone running out of juice, or forgetting where you put certain must-have items within your bag. Our team has also had these experiences, and we spent an entire year to study the way people travel. We designed the ClickPack Anti-theft Backpack as a result to combine “security, storage, convenience, comfort and beauty.

How this product was born   


At K, we start with consumer research to develop products that people want and need. We are always working to provide the most intimate and comfortable experience for people to use in their everyday life.  
Creation Process

 

 

Korin x CES 2017
First there was ClickPack 1.0. Creators showed the pack at CES2017, collected feedback, went back to the lab, and upgraded the design. The ClickPack Pro was born！

Why Crowdfunding?  
When travel and commerce are a part of your daily life, you may concern yourself with someone stealing your belongings, your phone running out of juice, or forgetting where you put certain must-have items within your bag. Our team has also had these experiences, and we spent an entire year to study the way people travel. We designed the ClickPack Anti-theft Backpack as a result to combine “security, storage, convenience, comfort and beauty. We would like to use the crowdfunding platform to share this amazing innovation so that more people can enjoy the pleasure of travel and a better lifestyle.",42.0,4,"4 Campaigns

While its utility may vary depending on who you are and what you do, it's one trusty companion that'll make quick work of the day's unexpected tasks, both big and small. Those of you that carry one know what I'm talking about.</p><p>With my first standard size pocket knife design, the goal was to create a knife that had the versatility to slice through various tasks. Such a tool would accompany you on your day's journey, so the knife had to be both compact and well-built for reliability and resilience. Last but not least, my goal was to design a knife that just plain looked good—something your friend or a curious stranger would stop to ask you about. Thus, the Strand &amp; the West was born.</p><p>Following the success of my previous projects, I received many requests to make a bigger pocket knife to which I said ""Let's do it!"" After many painstaking months, I present to you two new knives: the Strand with a frame lock, and the West with a slip joint design (non-locking). Both of these pocket knives are bigger than the previous designs, yet abide by the same principles of portability, a solid and reliable construction, and a refined visual aesthetic.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473741847/yt3rhz9jcfykft0itmpk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473741900/cs8razjy9grolhanuzvm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473741992/nxfubvdvz4hi3hpctomi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> Although they are the perfect size to clip in your pocket discreetly these folding knives are made to be seen.

While its utility may vary depending on who you are and what you do, it's one trusty companion that'll make quick work of the day's unexpected tasks, both big and small. Those of you that carry one know what I'm talking about.With my first standard size pocket knife design, the goal was to create a knife that had the versatility to slice through various tasks. Such a tool would accompany you on your day's journey, so the knife had to be both compact and well-built for reliability and resilience. Last but not least, my goal was to design a knife that just plain looked good—something your friend or a curious stranger would stop to ask you about. Thus, the Strand & the West was born.Following the success of my previous projects, I received many requests to make a bigger pocket knife to which I said ""Let's do it!"" After many painstaking months, I present to you two new knives: the Strand with a frame lock, and the West with a slip joint design (non-locking). Both of these pocket knives are bigger than the previous designs, yet abide by the same principles of portability, a solid and reliable construction, and a refined visual aesthetic. Although they are the perfect size to clip in your pocket discreetly these folding knives are made to be seen. With a balanced design and visual appeal the comfort of the knives was not overlooked.An everyday carry tool needs to be able to withstand your everyday grind, so we’ve built these knives out of some tough materials.The body is made of Grade 5 Titanium, a metal known for its strength and minimal weight. The blade is made of hardened D2 Steel, known for its sharpness and toughness.  Every component is made with the tightest tolerances, resulting in a strong, sturdy, and lightweight knife that is made to do work. Not to mention the look and feel of these knives are fantastic.1) The Strand is a frame lock design with a blade that is 2.8 inches, housed in a sturdy titanium frame. A great everyday carry and camping knife. Weight is 3.2 oz. The Strand BodyMeticulously machined titanium with smooth beveled edges that feel great in the hand Ergonomic notch in the handle has been placed at an optimal distance to double as a grip. Your index finger fits nicely in the grooveThe blade has a strong lock that can endure substantial pressureSmooth one handed opening actionEasy lock bar release when closing, comes with a stainless steel lock bar insertComes with a stainless steel ball detentTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:Blade Length: 2.8 inches Blade Thickness: .129 inches Body Length: 3.9 inches Open Length: 6.7 inches Blade Type: Clip Point Blade Grind: HollowBlade Steel: D2 Steel Body Type: Grade 5/6AL 4V Titanium Hardware: 416 Stainless Steel Washers: Phosphor bronzeWeight: 3.2 oz2) The West is the slip joint design that does not lock. Its length is 3.5 inches closed with a blade that is 2.5 inches. For the international backers, this one maybe for you (legal in almost all countries). Weight is 1.9 oz.The West BodyMeticulously Machined Titanium with smooth beveled edges that feel great in the hand.Ergonomic notch in the handle has been placed at an optimal distance to pull the blade out and double as a grip. Your middle finger fits nicely in the groove.The blade does not lock but has a very strong spring to hold the blade in place in the open position. A few extra steps are done such as heat treating and clamping in order to get a strong lever spring tension and a perfect fit. It is common to see small slip joint knives without pocket clips but for me a pocket clip is a must. The pocket clip allows the knife to ride securely in your pocket while feeling practically weightless. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:Blade Length: 2.5 inches Blade Thickness: .118 inchesBody Length: 3.5 inches Open Length: 6 inches Blade Type: Clip point Blade Grind: HollowBlade Steel: D2 Steel Body Type: Grade 5/6AL 4V Titanium Hardware: 416 stainless steel Washers: Phosphor bronzeWeight: 1.9 ozBladesBlades are made with D2 steel.

<h3><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>FAQ</b></span></h3>
<p><b>How is it possible to hide the bows in the cabin size luggage?</b><br/>It's little ""tricky"", but by placing them in our specially designed BowCase, serving as the leading handle of the Trinity SuitCase, you can ""drive-in"" onboard like an ordinary passenger with a wheeled suitcase. Onboard you remove the BowCase from the SuitCase and place it separately in a head locker. <br/><br/><b>Can I use the Trinity SuitCase as a cabin luggage for all the airlines?</b><br/>Yes, the SuitCase can be used with all the major airlines. There are some exceptions, like some local companies flying to smaller destinations, islands etc. Sometimes you have to leave even a cabin-size suitcase when boarding a big plane  (if there is too much hand luggage onboard). In such a situation you can just take the ViolinCase and the BowCase (possibly with the addition of our detachable lid of the SuitCase) bringing all the important objects with you into the plane. <br/>When you travel with many American Airlines, KLM, AirFrance for instance you leave the side pockets empty and fill the top pockets up to 23 or 25 cm total thicknesses. When you travel with Ryanair or Lufthansa you can fill the side pockets slightly and with Easy Jet or British Airways you can pack all the pockets to maximum.<br/><br/><b>Do you have a guarantee? </b><br/>We give lifetime guarantee for the composite shells and for other parts and details we give 3 years guarantee. Just make photo of the damaged part and we will send it to you. Almost all the parts are easy to exchange with a help of simple tools. <br/><b><br/>Can I choose my material and color?</b><br/>You can choose the outer layer of the composite shell. There is a natural carbon fiber surface. It can be painted in any color (optional). The jute outside layer can be natural brownish or dark red. In the future more colors of jute will be available, as will be a leather covered version. <br/>At the inside the standard solution is the grey fleece with leather cushions and details in several colors (black, dark brown, light brown, red). We offer as well several other colors, as you can see on our photos. We combine super-soft minky fleece and ordinary fleece. <br/><br/></p>
<p><b>Is it possible to use the case with a chinrest on the violin?</b></p>
<p>Yes, there is space inside for any model of chinrest.<br/></p>
<br/><b>Shipping?</b><br/>We'll start shipping at the end of May 2016. We'll keep you updated.<br/><br/><b>Can you ship to different countries?</b><br/>Yes, but please be aware of the specific import taxes and tariffs of the country you live in.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>Can I choose the material and outer finish of the BowCase?</b></p>
<p></p>
<div>The standard shell is made of <strong>ABS-plastic</strong>, but you can also choose even stronger (more resilient to an impact) and more attractive composite finishes in silver-<strong>glass fiber, carbon fiber </strong>and <b>natural </b><strong>jute</strong><b> fiber</b> (paying a smaller supplement). <p></p>
<p>There is something to consider, if you like the jute surface. This BowCase looks much less ”technical” at the airport, so it may attract some attention from the personal at the gate and it’s usually better to avoid it. </p>
<p>The carbon or glass fiber BowCase looks much more like an ordinary suitcase handle.  </p>
<p>If you don’t plan to use the BowCase with the SuitCase, the jute finish is the beautiful choice. You may also order a slightly shorter version of the composite BowCase (without the detachable SuitCase handle option).</p>
<p>The jute cases are slightly heavier than carbon fiber cases (jute fibers absorb more resin).  </p>
<p><b>Can I combine the composite BowCase with the soft cover?</b></p>
<p>Yes, you can, but you may think it would be a pity to hide such a beautiful BowCase. You can use it ”naked” on the top of the ViolinCase using straps (optional), where you <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">can attach the supplementary accessory pockets (for your shoulder rest , etc.) (there is a space for a rosin and strings inside the ViolinCase).</span></p>

</div></div>","This is the main purpose of the Trinity Set – to transport your violin and bows safely through the check-in procedure, without any discussions with flight personnel and the airline's one-piece-cabin-luggage-only -policy, buying extra seats etc. Just wheel it onboard, without anybody noticing that you are even travelling with an instrument! Onboard - remove the BowCase and place it next to the SuitCase in the overhead locker.The Trinity SuitCase also gives you plenty of space for your documents, computer, book, cosmetics, music, concert clothes and shoes. All that in one piece of cabin luggage of an adjustable size, within the size limits of virtually all the airlines. No need to check-in your computer, and no risk of standing on a concert podium without your concert dress.
Trinity ViolinCase



Trinity ViolinCase is made of hyper-modern composite materials (carbon and glass fibers)The composite shell can withstand substantial weight. This sandwich structure is extremely resilient to any impact.Trinity ViolinCase uses a strong external lock which both prevents an unauthorized opening and secures the whole case by fixing it to a firm object. 










The inside is covered with soft, insulating and lightweight polyester fleece. Elastic pillows keep the instrument gently but firmly in place. 
Additional structural reinforcements support the vault and ensure a supreme side impact protection : 2 interconnecting pillars on both sides of  a violin,  a full-height partition around the violin neck, virtually indestructible nylon hinges.




Trinity BowCase





The standard shell is made of robust ABS-plastic, reinforced with an aluminum&glass-fiber “spine”.


We offer versions in  glass fiber, carbon fiber and jute as well, also in shorter version (to be used only with the ViolinCase). These are even more attractive and more resilient to impact.

An external soft cover acts as an extra impact, scratch and heat shield. It can be securely attached to the Trinity ViolinCase. The detachable pockets (optional) offer space for a shoulder rest, Kensington retractable cable lock and other items (glasses, pencil etc).




The Trinity BowCase (without its soft cover) is used for leading the SuitCase.  Slide it into the channel, until you hear the click.




You can lead the SuitCase (with the Trinity ViolinCase inside) through the gate at the airport like any other passenger. 

Trinity SuitCase








2 versions of Trinity SuitCase



Trinity SuitCase with a traditional expandable lid has 2 outer pockets large enough for a 13’’ computer and 2 inner net-pockets. You can vary the thickness of your SuitCase between 20 and 25 cm.




Trinity SuitCase with a detachable lid is another unique solution by String King. You can detach the lid and turn it into a shoulder bag in seconds (the separate shoulder strap is provided). You can leave the SuitCase at the hotel and carry the bag with all the stuff you may need. It’s great for every-day use too.



You can secure the Trinity SuitCase to any solid object (like a shelf in the train) in a similar way as 2 other cases of the Trinity Set - by using the same  Kensington Click-Safe Lock Wire(optional). Simultaneously you can secure the BowCase - pull the Kensington lock wire through the loop and click it on the SuitCase. It is possible to secure even the entire Trinity Set.




If you want to have even better suspension you can add our ownSpring Suspension System (SSS) (available as a perk).The wheels will damp vibrations a bit like in a car.

Student life can be hard, as my boyfriend and I have only very recently found out – studying, social life, making living affordable – you get the idea. Although many people will endure these difficult times, some will find themselves suffering a lot more than most. One of these people I believe is my boyfriend of 7 years. 
We came from very different backgrounds, him and me. He came from a poor background in a relatively rough part of our city, with no educational aspirations or encouragement from his family. He agreed that he was to be destined to sign on to the dole. After we started talking, getting to know each other and seeing how each other lived, I tried to help him understand that he could achieve more in life than he thought he could. He soon found he had talent in music, soon became enthusiastic about design, and by the end of school he left with far better grades than most. I was so proud of him, and still am to this day. 
At the age of 18, only months after leaving school, we started university – he is studying design and myself nursing. We had plans to take a gap year after year 2 of uni to travel across Europe, which we put a lot of time and effort into planning. Everything was going well, until he suddenly lost his both of his grandfathers, one to a stroke and the other to a heart attack, and his own father suffered from other sudden heart issues. Needless to say this left a significant impact on him, and it was very noticeable to me. He was always a bit of a hypochondriac, but with all these things happening around him, it began to feel much more real to him. 
He was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression 2 years ago now, during which time he has become quiet, introverted and even afraid of going outside the house. I myself suffered from this in the past, and know how he feels.  After seeing him do so well all these years, it’s difficult for me to see him like this. He is void of any motivation and it’s only going to get worse.
I want to take him on an interrailling trip across Europe for 1 month in Summer. He has always wanted to go, and I know this will significantly help him. Unfortunately being a student means being relatively challenged in the financial department, and I don’t have the money to send him myself. He has no idea about this; it’s going to be a surprise if it goes ahead. We both need to get our lives back on track, all he needs is the proper inspiration. <p></p><div>Thank you to anyone who can support this. It will mean so much to me.</div></div>","Hi, my name is Connie and I want to raise money to send my boyfriend and I on a trip around Europe.

Needless to say this left a significant impact on him, and it was very noticeable to me. He was always a bit of a hypochondriac, but with all these things happening around him, it began to feel much more real to him. 
He was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression 2 years ago now, during which time he has become quiet, introverted and even afraid of going outside the house. I myself suffered from this in the past, and know how he feels.  After seeing him do so well all these years, it’s difficult for me to see him like this. He is void of any motivation and it’s only going to get worse.
I want to take him on an interrailling trip across Europe for 1 month in Summer. He has always wanted to go, and I know this will significantly help him. Unfortunately being a student means being relatively challenged in the financial department, and I don’t have the money to send him myself. He has no idea about this; it’s going to be a surprise if it goes ahead. We both need to get our lives back on track, all he needs is the proper inspiration. Thank you to anyone who can support this. It will mean so much to me.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are well on the way to completing our first vehicle - EV City Trike Cargo - a ¼ tonne van, which is being road tested prior to launch this Spring. Now we want to expand the range, with a two-seat passenger vehicle (EV City Trike 2Go) and a three-seater EV City Trike Taxi.</p>
<h2>The EV City Trike range</h2>
<p>We're planning three vehicles in the EV City Trike range:</p>
<h3><strong>EV City Trike Cargo</strong></h3>
<p>EV City Trike Cargo is our ultra-lightweight delivery vehicle. We have already done most of the development work on this vehicle and are planning to put it into production this Spring.</p>
<p>An enclosed cockpit provides a safe driving environment with protection from the elements. The unique cargo pod design can carry an astonishing 88 cubic feet of freight weighing up to one quarter of a tonne. The cargo pod can also be removed and swapped within seconds, giving us the flexibility of creating lots of different versions of this flexible design: a pickup truck, a flat bed, an advertising vehicle, even a mobile shop or coffee vendor can easily be built and fitted to our trike.</p>
<p>An optional solar roof provides enough energy to keep the on-board batteries topped up during the day: even on a dull winters day, the solar panel can generate enough power to give a range of up to 15 miles, whilst during the summer, the solar panel can provide a range of up to 60 miles.</p>
<p>Flat battery? Slide out the handheld battery pack and slot in a charged one. No need to park up to charge, EV City Trike Cargo can keep going, twenty-four hours a day. An optional roof-top solar panel can charge the batteries as you drive, which means for many owners they may not have to charge their batteries at all.</p>
<p>EV City Trike Cargo has been designed for city centre work: cut through the traffic using cycle lanes, squeeze into the tightest parking space and hop from delivery to delivery quickly and efficiently. With running costs of just a few pence a day, operators can save hundreds of pounds each month compared with running and fuelling a conventional small van.</p>
<p>EV City Trike Cargo production commences this March. We already have customers for them. If you live in Central London, you'll see them delivering packages and mail in just a few weeks time.</p>
<h3><strong>EV City Trike 2Go</strong></h3>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""City Trike 2Go is a stylish and fun way to travel."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/345/961/2481faf4435c33ce95f1348e0a72562a_large.jpg?1358622536"" src="""" style=""""/><em>EV City Trike 2Go is a stylish and fun way to travel.</em>
</div>
<p>EV City Trike 2Go is our passenger vehicle, currently under development for launch this summer. Taking two people and their luggage, EV City Trike is an eye-catching and stylish vehicle that allows you to cut through the rush hour traffic using cycle paths and lanes, yet gives you protection from the elements.</p>
<p>As with all our EV City Trikes, EV City Trike 2Go can be driven by anyone aged 14 or over. No driving licence, no tax, it can be used wherever you can use an ordinary bicycle.</p>
<p>Like EV City Trike Cargo, EV City Trike 2Go doesn't need to be parked up in order to charge the batteries. Unlock the handheld battery pack and it slides out in seconds. Slot in a fully charged battery to keep going and charge up your flat battery pack inside your home or place of work.</p>
<p>A generous luggage area takes the weekly shop with ease, whilst optional doors makes EV City Trike 2Go a practical vehicle for year-round use.</p>
<h3><strong>EV City Trike Taxi</strong></h3>
<p>EV City Trike Taxi is our ultra-modern take on the humble cycle rickshaw. Tourists love the cycle rickshaw experience and the EV City Trike Taxi brings this right up to date with a high tech, ultra-modern design. Unlike many cycle rickshaws, EV City Trike Taxi includes weather protection, luggage space, and safety built in.</p>
<p>EV City Trike Taxi provides seating for driver, two passengers and their luggage. It also incorporates safety features such as seat-belts and front and rear crumple zones to protect driver and passengers in the event of a shunt.</p>
<p>An optional solar roof provides an extended range and powers the on-board entertainment system. Optional twin video displays can entertain passengers and provide interactive advertising for passers-by.</p>
<h1><strong>The EV City Trike potential</strong></h1>
<p>We believe the worldwide market for the EV City Trike range is huge. Initially we're concentrating on Europe and North America, but later on we're planning on creating specific versions for South America and Asia, replacing existing diesel and two-stroke petro-oil engines with lighter, more efficient and less polluting electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Around many of the world's poorer countries, three wheel delivery vans and auto-rickshaw taxi's have huge, widespread use. Typically powered by diesel or two-stroke petro-oil mix, they are noisy, smelly and bad for the environment. Over half a million are sold each year. The biggest complaint from operators of these vehicles is the cost of fuel: it is common for the drivers to pay more for fuel than they earn themselves.</p>
<p>We believe that volume production in countries like Mexico and India will allow us to build EV City Trikes at a price and a specification to match the purchase price of these other vehicles. Combined with roof-top solar charging and tiny running costs, we believe the EV City Trike range could replace hundreds of thousands of diesel and two-stroke powered vehicles, with quiet, non-polluting, environmentally friendly EV City Trikes, making a genuine difference to the environment.</p>

</ul><h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>So far, we've been building our first pre-production vehicles. Chassis and drive-train development is complete and we have been running our vehicles - without bodies - for the past month, including road testing. First bodies for the EV City Trike Cargo have been completed and they are in the process of being fitted to our first vehicle (chassis number 2).</p>
<p>Fully completed pre-production versions of EV City Trike Cargo's will take to the streets by the end of January and real world evaluations with customers commence in mid February.</p>
<p>EV City Trike Taxi is a close derivative of EV City Trike Cargo: the chassis and cab is identical to EV City Trike Cargo. Only the rear of the vehicle is different, and in fact, customers could convert their bikes between cargo and taxi variants by changing the rear of the vehicle themselves.</p>
<p>EV City Trike 2Go is a narrower and shorter vehicle than EV City Trike Cargo. Mechanically, the vehicle is identical to the cargo and taxi derivatives and the chassis are built on the same jig as the bigger models. First prototypes of EV City Trike 2Go are scheduled to be built in April and May.</p>
<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are Bluebird Performance Engineering, a specialist electric vehicle design business based in the United Kingdom. Our design team have been developing electric vehicles since the 1990s, building everything from milk floats and leisure cars to the Electric Bluebird land speed race car which broke the UK electric car land speed records between 1998 and 2000.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""The Bluebird BE-3 electric land speed car broke eight national land speed records and won a Millennium Design Award."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/335/143/dbffedb9dbc9c75e9ae00bd54118ff71_large.jpg?1357927397"" src="""" style=""""/><em>The Bluebird BE-3 electric land speed car broke eight national land speed records and won a Millennium Design Award.</em>
</div>
<p>Our designers come from an automotive background. With a focus on form and efficiency, we take pride in creating vehicles that are super-efficient, practical and fun to use.</p>
<h2>How EV City Trike's are made</h2>
<p>EV City Trikes will be built by our own dedicated team of people based in the United Kingdom. Initially, our production team has the ability to manufacture up to 50 vehicles a month, but our plan is to set up a number of factories around the world to manufacture up to 3,000 vehicles per month at each location, using local staff and creating specific versions of EV Cargo Trike for different regions.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""Three wheel taxi's and small vans make up a significant proportion of the traffic in India's cities."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/335/140/ae240f3da99eb3c67f1ce0767589be7c_large.jpg?1357927107"" src="""" style=""""/><em>Three wheel taxi's and small vans make up a significant proportion of the traffic in India's cities.</em>
</div>
<p>Whilst these numbers may seem overly ambitious in Europe and North America, anyone who has ever been to India, China, Pakistan, The Philippines, Mexico, Argentina or Brazil will have seen how many three-wheel taxis, pick-up trucks and vans there are on the road. </p>
<h1>Why are we developing EV City Trikes?</h1>
<p>We're genuinely excited about the potential for electric vehicles and for what they can mean for our future. We believe they can have a substantial impact on the environment, reducing carbon emissions and pollution in some of the worlds most crowded cities.</p>
<p>Yet to make a real difference means thinking in new ways. Simply replacing a conventional car with an electric car gives a limited benefit. Looking at how vehicles are used and creating a brand new type of vehicle from the ground up to answer the needs for the 21st Century gives the real opportunity for a positive change for the future.</p>
<p>Take the EV City Trike Cargo, for example. Because we can use cycle lanes and cut through busy traffic, our trike can deliver goods faster and more efficiently than using a conventional van. Our research suggests that up to 25% of all the vans delivering goods in and around the centre of London could be replaced by trikes, streamlining the delivery process, reducing the cost of deliveries for business and removing an estimated eighteen million tonnes of Carbon Dioxide and NOx emissions from the air in London every year.</p>
<p>Look across the world and the opportunities are far greater. There are an estimated three million three wheel Tuk-tuk three wheel taxis in use around the world and around half a million three wheel commercial vehicles are sold each year. The vast majority of these are used in third world cities where the smog hangs over the cities like a thick cloud and tens of thousands of people die as a result every year.</p>
<p>Imagine the difference to city pollution levels if low-cost solar powered vehicles replaced dirty diesel and two-stroke petrol engines? We can't achieve everything right now, but step by step, we can get to the point where our EV City Trike can genuinely replace these vehicles at a similar price point.</p>
<h2>Why Indiegogo?</h2>
<p>We've got this far using our own funds and our own dedication. We are serious about what we do and we have had considerable interest from investors from around the world.</p>
<p>Yet not all money is created equal. Finding partners who are passionate about the vision and not just in making a quick buck is not so easy.</p>
<p>Indiegogo is different. Finding a community that is so dynamic and so keen on change has been genuinely exciting and has motivated our entire team. So instead of talking to investors who are just interested on a return on their investment in the shortest possible time, we're looking for the Indiegogo community to join us on the exciting journey to create a new generation of low carbon vehicles.</p>
<p>We already have customers for our vehicles. The first EV City Trike Cargo's will be delivered to these customers this Spring.</p>
<p>With Indiegogo, we can go further: not just have one model, but put three variants of the EV City Trike into production. The money will be used for producing the first production models, employing staff and getting the vehicles into the hands of our customers.</p>
<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>As Bluebird, we're used to technical challenges and overcoming them. From designing land speed record breaking racing cars to putting an electric milk float into production in China, our designers, engineers and managers have learnt how to overcome the challenges that designing and producing a new electric vehicle throws up.</p>
<p>Technically, EV City Trike is one of the simplest developments we've ever worked on. Yet it hasn't been without its challenges.</p>
<p>Our initial design brief was to ""build an electric van for city centre deliveries that can carry a quarter of a tonne and weighs less than 60 kilograms"". Could it be done? Conventional wisdom, automotive designers and existing pedal trike manufacturers said it couldn't. It took six months of designing, computer simulations, prototyping and planning to prove it could.</p>
<p>It has meant looking closely at every aspect of the design, fine-tuning components to ensure the best efficiency. For example, our limited slip differential and rear axle, complete with twin inboard disk brakes, weighs less than 4 kilos. The battery pack weighs about the same.</p>
<p>Compare that to a conventional light electric van where the final drive weighs 60kg and the battery pack weighs a further 150kg, you can see how designing in efficiency can have significant environmental and cost savings in the amount of raw materials used to manufacture a vehicle.</p>
<p>We've had suppliers let us down; we've had components that looked great on the computer but that needed rework when they were built and tested; we've gone back to the drawing board to make a good design even better where we see the need and we've been working with the authorities to ensure the vehicle passes all the safety and legislative tests before it can be put on sale. It's all part of the development, testing and production processes.</p>
<p>Once complete, however, will it sell? Initial reaction from around the world suggests it will. We have interest in manufacturing EV City Trike in Mexico and India, we have interest from distributors and retailers around the world. We already have customers in the United Kingdom who will take delivery of their first vehicles this Spring.</p>
<p>We are planning on appointing our first sales agents this Spring, and touring the UK to demonstrate and show EV City Trike to the public this summer. Next year, we'll have EV City Trike's in volume production in the UK and be working hard on getting them into production in other countries around the world.</p>
<p>No business is ever guaranteed its success, but we are confident that EV City Trike is a great product that is here to stay.</p></div>","EV City Trike is a new direction for inner city transport.

The EV City Trike range
We're planning three vehicles in the EV City Trike range:
EV City Trike Cargo
EV City Trike Cargo is our ultra-lightweight delivery vehicle. We have already done most of the development work on this vehicle and are planning to put it into production this Spring.
An enclosed cockpit provides a safe driving environment with protection from the elements. The unique cargo pod design can carry an astonishing 88 cubic feet of freight weighing up to one quarter of a tonne. The cargo pod can also be removed and swapped within seconds, giving us the flexibility of creating lots of different versions of this flexible design: a pickup truck, a flat bed, an advertising vehicle, even a mobile shop or coffee vendor can easily be built and fitted to our trike.
An optional solar roof provides enough energy to keep the on-board batteries topped up during the day: even on a dull winters day, the solar panel can generate enough power to give a range of up to 15 miles, whilst during the summer, the solar panel can provide a range of up to 60 miles.
Flat battery? Slide out the handheld battery pack and slot in a charged one. No need to park up to charge, EV City Trike Cargo can keep going, twenty-four hours a day. An optional roof-top solar panel can charge the batteries as you drive, which means for many owners they may not have to charge their batteries at all.
EV City Trike Cargo has been designed for city centre work: cut through the traffic using cycle lanes, squeeze into the tightest parking space and hop from delivery to delivery quickly and efficiently. With running costs of just a few pence a day, operators can save hundreds of pounds each month compared with running and fuelling a conventional small van.
EV City Trike Cargo production commences this March. We already have customers for them. If you live in Central London, you'll see them delivering packages and mail in just a few weeks time.
EV City Trike 2Go

Taking two people and their luggage, EV City Trike is an eye-catching and stylish vehicle that allows you to cut through the rush hour traffic using cycle paths and lanes, yet gives you protection from the elements.
As with all our EV City Trikes, EV City Trike 2Go can be driven by anyone aged 14 or over. No driving licence, no tax, it can be used wherever you can use an ordinary bicycle.
Like EV City Trike Cargo, EV City Trike 2Go doesn't need to be parked up in order to charge the batteries. Unlock the handheld battery pack and it slides out in seconds. Slot in a fully charged battery to keep going and charge up your flat battery pack inside your home or place of work.

Project Status
So far, we've been building our first pre-production vehicles. Chassis and drive-train development is complete and we have been running our vehicles - without bodies - for the past month, including road testing. First bodies for the EV City Trike Cargo have been completed and they are in the process of being fitted to our first vehicle (chassis number 2).
Fully completed pre-production versions of EV City Trike Cargo's will take to the streets by the end of January and real world evaluations with customers commence in mid February.
EV City Trike Taxi is a close derivative of EV City Trike Cargo: the chassis and cab is identical to EV City Trike Cargo. Only the rear of the vehicle is different, and in fact, customers could convert their bikes between cargo and taxi variants by changing the rear of the vehicle themselves.
EV City Trike 2Go is a narrower and shorter vehicle than EV City Trike Cargo. Mechanically, the vehicle is identical to the cargo and taxi derivatives and the chassis are built on the same jig as the bigger models. First prototypes of EV City Trike 2Go are scheduled to be built in April and May.
Who are we?
We are Bluebird Performance Engineering, a specialist electric vehicle design business based in the United Kingdom. Our design team have been developing electric vehicles since the 1990s, building everything from milk floats and leisure cars to the Electric Bluebird land speed race car which broke the UK electric car land speed records between 1998 and 2000.

The Bluebird BE-3 electric land speed car broke eight national land speed records and won a Millennium Design Award.

Our designers come from an automotive background. With a focus on form and efficiency, we take pride in creating vehicles that are super-efficient, practical and fun to use.
How EV City Trike's are made
EV City Trikes will be built by our own dedicated team of people based in the United Kingdom. Initially, our production team has the ability to manufacture up to 50 vehicles a month, but our plan is to set up a number of factories around the world to manufacture up to 3,000 vehicles per month at each location, using local staff and creating specific versions of EV Cargo Trike for different regions.

Three wheel taxi's and small vans make up a significant proportion of the traffic in India's cities.

Whilst these numbers may seem overly ambitious in Europe and North America, anyone who has ever been to India, China, Pakistan, The Philippines, Mexico, Argentina or Brazil will have seen how many three-wheel taxis, pick-up trucks and vans there are on the road. 
Why are we developing EV City Trikes?
We're genuinely excited about the potential for electric vehicles and for what they can mean for our future. We believe they can have a substantial impact on the environment, reducing carbon emissions and pollution in some of the worlds most crowded cities.
Yet to make a real difference means thinking in new ways. Simply replacing a conventional car with an electric car gives a limited benefit. Looking at how vehicles are used and creating a brand new type of vehicle from the ground up to answer the needs for the 21st Century gives the real opportunity for a positive change for the future.
Take the EV City Trike Cargo, for example. Because we can use cycle lanes and cut through busy traffic, our trike can deliver goods faster and more efficiently than using a conventional van. Our research suggests that up to 25% of all the vans delivering goods in and around the centre of London could be replaced by trikes, streamlining the delivery process, reducing the cost of deliveries for business and removing an estimated eighteen million tonnes of Carbon Dioxide and NOx emissions from the air in London every year.
Look across the world and the opportunities are far greater. There are an estimated three million three wheel Tuk-tuk three wheel taxis in use around the world and around half a million three wheel commercial vehicles are sold each year. The vast majority of these are used in third world cities where the smog hangs over the cities like a thick cloud and tens of thousands of people die as a result every year.
Imagine the difference to city pollution levels if low-cost solar powered vehicles replaced dirty diesel and two-stroke petrol engines? We can't achieve everything right now, but step by step, we can get to the point where our EV City Trike can genuinely replace these vehicles at a similar price point.
Why Indiegogo?
We've got this far using our own funds and our own dedication. We are serious about what we do and we have had considerable interest from investors from around the world.
Yet not all money is created equal. Finding partners who are passionate about the vision and not just in making a quick buck is not so easy.
Indiegogo is different. Finding a community that is so dynamic and so keen on change has been genuinely exciting and has motivated our entire team. So instead of talking to investors who are just interested on a return on their investment in the shortest possible time, we're looking for the Indiegogo community to join us on the exciting journey to create a new generation of low carbon vehicles.
We already have customers for our vehicles. The first EV City Trike Cargo's will be delivered to these customers this Spring.
With Indiegogo, we can go further: not just have one model, but put three variants of the EV City Trike into production. The money will be used for producing the first production models, employing staff and getting the vehicles into the hands of our customers.
Risks and Challenges
As Bluebird, we're used to technical challenges and overcoming them. From designing land speed record breaking racing cars to putting an electric milk float into production in China, our designers, engineers and managers have learnt how to overcome the challenges that designing and producing a new electric vehicle throws up.
Technically, EV City Trike is one of the simplest developments we've ever worked on. Yet it hasn't been without its challenges.
Our initial design brief was to ""build an electric van for city centre deliveries that can carry a quarter of a tonne and weighs less than 60 kilograms"". Could it be done? Conventional wisdom, automotive designers and existing pedal trike manufacturers said it couldn't. It took six months of designing, computer simulations, prototyping and planning to prove it could.
It has meant looking closely at every aspect of the design, fine-tuning components to ensure the best efficiency. For example, our limited slip differential and rear axle, complete with twin inboard disk brakes, weighs less than 4 kilos. The battery pack weighs about the same.
Compare that to a conventional light electric van where the final drive weighs 60kg and the battery pack weighs a further 150kg, you can see how designing in efficiency can have significant environmental and cost savings in the amount of raw materials used to manufacture a vehicle.
We've had suppliers let us down; we've had components that looked great on the computer but that needed rework when they were built and tested; we've gone back to the drawing board to make a good design even better where we see the need and we've been working with the authorities to ensure the vehicle passes all the safety and legislative tests before it can be put on sale. It's all part of the development, testing and production processes.
Once complete, however, will it sell? Initial reaction from around the world suggests it will. We have interest in manufacturing EV City Trike in Mexico and India, we have interest from distributors and retailers around the world. We already have customers in the United Kingdom who will take delivery of their first vehicles this Spring.
We are planning on appointing our first sales agents this Spring, and touring the UK to demonstrate and show EV City Trike to the public this summer. Next year, we'll have EV City Trike's in volume production in the UK and be working hard on getting them into production in other countries around the world.
No business is ever guaranteed its success, but we are confident that EV City Trike is a great product that is here to stay.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>""I’m ready for it. The older you get the more ready for it you are. I’ve been waiting 11 years.""</p>
<p>""So you were ready at 80? You’ve never been afraid of death? That seems to be a lot of people’s greatest fear.""</p>
<p>""The greatest fear is fear. Death is just a gateway to higher consciousness. The fear comes from religions. They try to indoctrinate you with all this crap to make you scared and coming back to them. I only made it past the 8th grade but I know how to think for myself.

<p>""No, I’m an amateur physicist.""</p>
<p>""Got any good stories?""</p>
<p>""So I’m at my physics study group at my bodega, and I’m tripping on molly, and this guy walks in, and he looks exactly like Maude, from Harold and Maude, and it’s just one of those silver bullet moments where you realize you’re instantly in love. Like instantly. And I just jumped on him, and I didn’t stop talking till like 6 in the morning. Then we parted ways. The next morning he sends me this video, it’s called Paperman. It won an Oscar for like, best short. And the plot of that is there’s this guy. And he runs into this girl on the subway, and she gets her lipstick on a piece of paper. Then he goes to work and they miss each other, when he gets there she’s in the building across from him and he makes hundreds of paper airplanes trying to get her attention. And it doesn’t work. But then all these paper airplanes, in this Disney cinematic way, whirl him up and take him to her. So my guy lives in this mansion on Alamo Square. So I spent like the whole week making these paper airplanes for him. Like thousands of them, like stealing paper reams from work and making paper airplanes. I ask my friends to help me, so me and thirty other people cover this mansion. Fucking cover it. He comes home and says, 'Nobody’s ever done this for me before. I’m totally in love with you.' So I win his heart…or so I think, because that’s the end of it and he never texts me again. Then when I get drunk enough to text him to ask ‘What gives?’ he texts back saying, ‘I’m sorry but my heart belongs to someone else.’ But then, 5 days pass and he texts me again saying he made a mistake and he wants to be with me. So I don’t know if that’s a good story yet. I don’t think the arc is complete. So you know, I put myself out there. And now I’m invited back in, but I’m too scared to go there again because it failed…but it kinda succeeded. I don’t know.”</p>

<p>""Has the neighborhood changed much since you’ve been here?""</p>
<p>""Oh yeah, in 1972 the milkman would bring milk in glass bottles to your doorstep and leave them. And no one would touch them. Now…forget about it. People will kill you here on the street for $5. Sometimes they think you have something and they kill you, and then they realize you have nothing.""</p>

I’ve lived here since 1972 and I stayed until 1976 when I moved to Richmond because I didn’t want to raise my kids in the projects, but that was before there were all the drugs and foolishness going on out there. Me…I just liked to work, go to church, and raise my kids but a lot of people out there were into that other stuff.”</p>

I remember he said he was going to be wearing a Bart Simpson t-shirt, but then it was too cold and everyone had jackets on. But I just went on up to the person I thought looked like my kin and asked, 'Are you wearing a Bart Simpson t-shirt?' and he gave me a big hug and said, 'You’re my mama!'</p>

""I’m ready for it. The older you get the more ready for it you are. I’ve been waiting 11 years.""
""So you were ready at 80? You’ve never been afraid of death? That seems to be a lot of people’s greatest fear.""
""The greatest fear is fear. Death is just a gateway to higher consciousness. The fear comes from religions. They try to indoctrinate you with all this crap to make you scared and coming back to them. I only made it past the 8th grade but I know how to think for myself. The secret is to question things.""

From Hayes Valley

""I like your style.""
""I like yours.""
""Can I sit down with you for a minute?""
""Sure.""
""Are you a writer?""
""No, I’m an amateur physicist.""
""Got any good stories?""
""So I’m at my physics study group at my bodega, and I’m tripping on molly, and this guy walks in, and he looks exactly like Maude, from Harold and Maude, and it’s just one of those silver bullet moments where you realize you’re instantly in love. Like instantly. And I just jumped on him, and I didn’t stop talking till like 6 in the morning. Then we parted ways. The next morning he sends me this video, it’s called Paperman. It won an Oscar for like, best short. And the plot of that is there’s this guy. And he runs into this girl on the subway, and she gets her lipstick on a piece of paper. Then he goes to work and they miss each other, when he gets there she’s in the building across from him and he makes hundreds of paper airplanes trying to get her attention. And it doesn’t work. But then all these paper airplanes, in this Disney cinematic way, whirl him up and take him to her. So my guy lives in this mansion on Alamo Square. So I spent like the whole week making these paper airplanes for him. Like thousands of them, like stealing paper reams from work and making paper airplanes. I ask my friends to help me, so me and thirty other people cover this mansion. Fucking cover it. He comes home and says, 'Nobody’s ever done this for me before. I’m totally in love with you.' So I win his heart…or so I think, because that’s the end of it and he never texts me again. Then when I get drunk enough to text him to ask ‘What gives?’ he texts back saying, ‘I’m sorry but my heart belongs to someone else.’ But then, 5 days pass and he texts me again saying he made a mistake and he wants to be with me. So I don’t know if that’s a good story yet. I don’t think the arc is complete. So you know, I put myself out there. And now I’m invited back in, but I’m too scared to go there again because it failed…but it kinda succeeded. I don’t know.”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From The Mission

""Do you live in this neighborhood?""
""Yeah, I moved here from Nicaragua when I was 14 and have been here my whole life.""
""Has the neighborhood changed much since you’ve been here?""
""Oh yeah, in 1972 the milkman would bring milk in glass bottles to your doorstep and leave them. And no one would touch them. Now…forget about it. People will kill you here on the street for $5. Sometimes they think you have something and they kill you, and then they realize you have nothing.""
""Why do you think everything changed?""
""Drugs. It’s drugs. Too much drugs. But what are you gonna do? Time changes things. Some people say, ‘The world…the world has changed.’ The world hasn’t changed. People’s attitude has changed.""
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From The Fillmore

""Hi! Would you mind if I take your picture?""
""Sure! My name’s Grace. I live in the senior center up on Fillmore. I’m a senior citizen. I’m 72 years old. I’ve lived here since 1972 and I stayed until 1976 when I moved to Richmond because I didn’t want to raise my kids in the projects, but that was before there were all the drugs and foolishness going on out there. Me…I just liked to work, go to church, and raise my kids but a lot of people out there were into that other stuff.”
""How many kids do you have?""
""6, I raised 5 of them. 1 was kidnapped when he was 6 months old. His father took him and told him a bunch of lies. He told him that he was found on a doorstep. He didn’t find out about me till he was 23 years old. Then he came out and met me at the train station. I remember he said he was going to be wearing a Bart Simpson t-shirt, but then it was too cold and everyone had jackets on. But I just went on up to the person I thought looked like my kin and asked, 'Are you wearing a Bart Simpson t-shirt?' and he gave me a big hug and said, 'You’re my mama!'
""That’s a great story.""
""That’s San Francisco, when I was back in Lufkin, Texas, that’s where I’m from, I told people I wanted to go to San Francisco. All that was there for me in Texas was picking cotton, the KKK and people telling me I wasn’t shit. They told me if I tried to leave I’d end up dead on the street. But you know what I told them?"" 
""What?""
""Dead is dead, but before I die I’m going to see San Francisco!""
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From a Transient Spirit



""Hey, we’re visiting from Pennsylvania. Can you tell me where there are Buddhist temples here?""
""Yeah, there’s one in Hayes Valley. Are you Buddhist?""
""I’m Sikh.""
""What are the tenents of being a Sikh?""
""They’re the same as another religion. It’s about love, compassion, kindness. The ways we practice are different but the core is the same.""
""What’s unique about your practice?""
""We don’t cut our hair, or alter our body in any way. In our view the body is sacred. It’s a gift from God. And God is not a man in the sky. It’s a level of consciousness. It’s an energy you take in when you eat food, a fragrance you take in when you smell a flower, an energy you breathe in and out when you are true harmony. I don’t know what happens when you achieve that level of harmony, but that’s the goal.""

<p>Each Chameleon has 36 liters worth of storage to hold everything from your weekend camping or hiking gear to your school, work, or leisure supplies. We made sure to include water bladder and laptop storage spaces, along with a side cup holder. To take it a step further, we designed the pack with Molle, used in military and tactical bags, that allow you to attach your desired items and increase the capacity to suit your needs. The lashing buckles make it easy to carry larger items like fishing poles, tents, compound hunting bows or anything you can think of.  </p>

</div></div></div>","When your gear does more, you can carry less. We designed the Chameleon Backpack to make it easier to get outdoors and make your experience more comfortable and enjoyable anytime, anywhere!  We all love the exhilarating feeling of just being in nature and exhausting ourselves on the trail. We should be rewarded and take a load off where ever we want, whenever we want. The Chameleon Pack/ Sit System lets you sit back and enjoy the beauty without having to choose between a rock and a hard place.
 


Using the Chameleon’s patent-pending Penta-zip technology, simply unzip, arrange the collapsible Sit-System frame, attach the pack to the frame, then sit back and relax.The removable Switch Bags™ that hold all of your gear will drape over the sides of the chair so you can easily access everything you need without emptying your pack. 
Beyond just a backpack to chair transformation, the Chameleon can separate to form 2 backpacks. Each Chameleon includes two 16 liter removable stuff sacks that hold all of your gear inside. They can be carried independently as separate drawstring slings or can connect together to form a 32-liter drawstring backpack so you get two for one.
 
 


 

Here's how the Chameleon Pack is ""FORGING NEW TRAILS"" in the outdoor backpack industry. THEY ARE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT IT...

 

With your 2 included removable Switch Bags, you won’t have to worry about emptying your pack before taking a load off.  The Standard Switch Bags are accessible from the top by drawstring when housed inside the pack, but also 2 full-length zippers that zip from top to bottom and bottom to top. This gives you easy access to your stuff from any angle, both as a backpack and when lounging in your chair.

 
OPTIONAL UPGRADE TO CUSTOM SWITCH BAGS

Choose between the following CUSTOM combinations:
1. Dry Switch Bag with a Cooler Bag  2. Dry Switch Bag with a Compartment/Camera Bag 
3. Compartment/ Camera Bag with a Cooler Bag  4. Two Dry Switch Bags
*Notice by purchasing BOTH options 1 AND 2 OR 3 AND 4 you will be able to achieve all four configurations. Available MAY 2018
The best part about ALL of the Switch Bags? They can be used as individual slings or combined together to form a backpack. Think of it as two packs in one.





Using our patent-pending technology, you’ll be able to sit back, relax and unwind whenever wherever. The ultra-light, aluminum, collapsible Sit-System frame is rated up to 300 pounds. The anchors and seat flap are permanently fastened and secure. 

 

 

No matter where life takes you, the Chameleon will be there to carry your load or help you take a load off, keeping you comfortable and prepared at all times.

 

You need a pack that can withstand whatever you throw at it, which is why we made the Chameleon with heavy duty abrasion and water-resistant denier nylon. The interior Switch Bags provide an added layer of protection from the elements.  

 

 


Each Chameleon has 36 liters worth of storage to hold everything from your weekend camping or hiking gear to your school, work, or leisure supplies. We made sure to include water bladder and laptop storage spaces, along with a side cup holder. To take it a step further, we designed the pack with Molle, used in military and tactical bags, that allow you to attach your desired items and increase the capacity to suit your needs. The lashing buckles make it easy to carry larger items like fishing poles, tents, compound hunting bows or anything you can think of.  

 

 

 

The Chameleon isn’t just for hikers, campers, hunters and fishermen. We designed the Chameleon to be useful for all active people, like athletes, parents, students, park goers, tail-gaiters, backyard barbecuers and everyone in between. The best part is that you won’t have to choose function over fashion with the Chameleon’s jaw-dropping, one-of-a-kind design. So go show it off wherever you go!

Looking over our shoulders to make sure our belongings are safe; the constant paranoia of becoming a victim of pickpockets. Or worse still, getting backaches on holidays from wearing frontpacks. Sound familiar?We thought there had to be a better way. We searched high and low for the perfect daypack, but couldn't find one. So we designed one ourselves.After 5 months, 4 prototypes, 2 trips, countless emails and cups of coffee later; we bring you The Freedom Pack.The World's First Packable Anti-Theft Backpack. The Freedom Pack collapses into it's own pouch so you'll never lose it. We designed The Freedom Pack to be used as a packable daypack you transition into upon arrival at your destination.Taking up minimal footprint in your main luggage, it expands to a perfectly sized 12 litres to carry your daily travel essentials.

Every feature and detail in the backpack has been carefully considered with the goal of helping you focus on enjoying and exploring with the peace of mind.The Freedom Pack is theft-proof. Hidden zippers combined with durable rip-resistant exteriors keep your belongings safe from pickpockets All of the bag's YKK zippered compartments are hidden against your back.

<p>We all want to believe that living a good life and doing well unto others somehow insulates us from bad things happening but sometimes Mother Nature with her wicked sense of humor just catches up with us.</p>
<p>Last week (Friday, August 3) fire swept through Norman, Oklahoma and took away everything from our sister-in-law, Jaime O'Brien.</p>
<p>Jamie is a single mom who has been struggling to raise her son Christian in Norman, Oklahoma. She has suffered from numerous medical issues over the last few years but has always managed to hold it together, hold down a job and make enough money to support her and Christian.</p>
<p>She's survived through some tough times, but through it all she maintains a great positive attitude, stays cheerful and always serves as a great role model for Christian.</p>
<p>But last week she lost everything she owns to a grass fire, and now she’s about to lose her job.</p>
<p>When the fire swept through her neighborhood she was able to grab a few clothes and possessions and get herself, Christian, his girlfriend and her little daughter to safety, but she lost her whole life in the process.</p>
<p>She lost her home, most of her life's possessions, family photographs, her grandma’s china, 3 of her cats, and, of all things, her false teeth! A few years ago, Jaime had to have all of her teeth removed due to a medical issue and now they are gone for good. So much that is irreplaceable, and yet she has managed to maintain her sense of humor through this whole thing. I’m not sure most of us could have stayed so calm.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, at the end of this month she will also lose her job as the company she works for is shutting down in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Not only will she be homeless but also unemployed.</p>
<p>The family is helping her out in the short term with a place to stay, food and clothing, but she is going to need much more assistance to re-build her life and find work.</p>
<p>As the governor has not declared this a federal emergency, she won't qualify for any federal or state assistance (although the Red Cross is doing what they can) and she doesn't have any insurance (insurance is very expensive on a mobile home in a rural area, with a volunteer fire dept and no fire hydrants. Jaime and most people living around her just couldn't afford it).</p>
<h3><strong>We're Raising Money to Rebuild Her Life</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal is at least $50,000 to rebuild her mobile home, furnish it and try to replace some of the basic things she lost.</p>
<p>We want to replace:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her home</li>
<li>Her furniture</li>
<li>Her clothes, Christian’s, Angie’s and Charlotte’s (they lost nearly all of them, and all their shoes)</li>
<li>Definitely her teeth!</li>

A virtual tombstone allows participants to view and
virtually visit their loved one’s memorial with the help of a geolocation
system. You will see the exact location of the site and visit anytime you wish.
 In addition, RipCemetery can serve as a
central meeting point to remember cremated loved ones. Family and friends can
visit the virtual memorial to share a memory, post a photo or give a flower or
small gift</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>The Big Idea</h3>
<p>So as the go to guy for tech support from friends and family like many in my situations you got all kinds of questions. One of the most frequent questions though becomes ""I want to get a new machine be it a desktop or a laptop, but what should I do with the old machine?"" Inevitably that turns into ""would you like my old machine?""</p>
<p>So this in turn got me thinking what can I do with all of this stuff? Sure you can recycle the old machines, but I kept thinking there has to be a better way. Why not re-purpose the machines for people or places in need like low income people, children, struggling college students ect..!<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Take in old machines that are not being used or needed <br/>
</li> <li>Provide a service if needed to help people data migrate from their old device<br/>
</li> <li>Let them know I'll securely wipe their device so a worry free experience<br/>
</li>
<li>Fix up and lean up the old machines and get them ready to give to people and places in need!<br/>
</li> </ul>
<p>Not only will it help people get rid of their old machines in a meaningful way it could help stop the currently growing problem of the digital divide by providing more people with technology access through their own computer!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Places I have seen this work</h3>
<p>Now this idea has been put in to action in other major cities around the world. In particular Nonprofit Technology Resources or NTR in Philadelphia is a non profit I would like to eventually model myself after. You can check out their offerings over at <a href=""http://ntrweb.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NTRWEB.ORG</a> and I even contacted them on some advice to get things rolling.</p>
<p>Friends have said they have seen the profound change an organization such as NTR has done in Philadelphia, and I plan to do the same thing in Augusta, GA.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need</h3> In general other than just getting people to donate old devices the main thing would be just a general fund to pull from in case I get low on certain parts that I can't re-purpose from multiple machines to create a working one. That plus just general working tools and my investment to getting the computers to the right people and places.<br/><br/>$1000 is a nice amount of money to start with though obviously the bigger
 the fund the faster I should be able to get devices out there vs 
waiting for other used machines with the working parts needed.<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Parts and tools to get the operation of the ground</li>
<li>Costs for software and licenses that could be needed<br/>
</li>
<li>Also money helps with the time, organization, gas, driving ect... that will be involved to pull this off.</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>With so much current reliance on computers just to get through in our daily lives helping others get access can be huge. It gives people and places the means to stay at pace with the modern age.</p>
<p>Step up to the world and donate to my cause and together we can help stem the tide and provide access for as many people as possible!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>One of the main challenges beyond just finding people and places is obviously the current reliance on Internet connectivity to get things done. Thankfully there are a myriad of different places that will allow you free WiFi access even if it isn't the fastest.<br/><br/>The other obvious hurdle is making sure you have an OS for all the computers to use. Thankfully in the modern age there are very user friendly Linux Distros that can be used if OSX or Windows isn't available, and most people mainly use the web as their tool. In this regard all the platforms have access to things like Chrome and Firefox for free so people can still have a meaningful experience no matter what!<br/><br/>Finally I'll personally be willing to help people get antiquated with their new devices as much as possible and get them set so they can confidently use their new computer for their needs with no hassle!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

</div></div>","The Big Idea
So as the go to guy for tech support from friends and family like many in my situations you got all kinds of questions. One of the most frequent questions though becomes ""I want to get a new machine be it a desktop or a laptop, but what should I do with the old machine?"" Inevitably that turns into ""would you like my old machine?""
So this in turn got me thinking what can I do with all of this stuff? Sure you can recycle the old machines, but I kept thinking there has to be a better way. Why not re-purpose the machines for people or places in need like low income people, children, struggling college students ect..!

Take in old machines that are not being used or needed 
 Provide a service if needed to help people data migrate from their old device
 Let them know I'll securely wipe their device so a worry free experience

Fix up and lean up the old machines and get them ready to give to people and places in need!
 
Not only will it help people get rid of their old machines in a meaningful way it could help stop the currently growing problem of the digital divide by providing more people with technology access through their own computer!

Places I have seen this work
Now this idea has been put in to action in other major cities around the world. In particular Nonprofit Technology Resources or NTR in Philadelphia is a non profit I would like to eventually model myself after. You can check out their offerings over at NTRWEB.ORG and I even contacted them on some advice to get things rolling.
Friends have said they have seen the profound change an organization such as NTR has done in Philadelphia, and I plan to do the same thing in Augusta, GA.
   What I Need In general other than just getting people to donate old devices the main thing would be just a general fund to pull from in case I get low on certain parts that I can't re-purpose from multiple machines to create a working one. That plus just general working tools and my investment to getting the computers to the right people and places.$1000 is a nice amount of money to start with though obviously the bigger
 the fund the faster I should be able to get devices out there vs 
waiting for other used machines with the working parts needed.
Parts and tools to get the operation of the ground
Costs for software and licenses that could be needed

Also money helps with the time, organization, gas, driving ect... that will be involved to pull this off.

  
The Impact With so much current reliance on computers just to get through in our daily lives helping others get access can be huge. It gives people and places the means to stay at pace with the modern age.
Step up to the world and donate to my cause and together we can help stem the tide and provide access for as many people as possible!
  
Risks & ChallengesOne of the main challenges beyond just finding people and places is obviously the current reliance on Internet connectivity to get things done. Thankfully there are a myriad of different places that will allow you free WiFi access even if it isn't the fastest.The other obvious hurdle is making sure you have an OS for all the computers to use. Thankfully in the modern age there are very user friendly Linux Distros that can be used if OSX or Windows isn't available, and most people mainly use the web as their tool. In this regard all the platforms have access to things like Chrome and Firefox for free so people can still have a meaningful experience no matter what!Finally I'll personally be willing to help people get antiquated with their new devices as much as possible and get them set so they can confidently use their new computer for their needs with no hassle!
  
Other Ways You Can Help The key linchpin in all of this is if you personally know me to get in contact and donate your old devices.

Thank you, Joe! :)</p></div>","FEMININE WEAPON is an IDENTITY, a LIFESTYLE, and a MOVEMENT that fosters empowerment and inspires women to become their best selves. Since its inception, Feminine Weapon has developed a flourishing online and offline community. We plan to expand our reach further, creating a global meeting place for women that connects and shares the stories of individuals creating positive change in themselves, their communities, and around the world.  In July of 2012 we began producing events to enrich the lives of women through spirituality, connection, health and relationships. In 2013 we co-produced a World Sexual Health Day Celebration, Women Rock NYC and launched FeminineWeapon.com on the Eden Network. In 2014 we declared January 30th as Feminine Weapon Day, a day designated to Honor Your Conscious Light + Beautiful Self. To celebrate, we hosted a concert and photography exhibit at The Cutting Room in New York.Feminine Weapon Day: January 30, 2014Feminine Weapon Photography SeriesNext, with your contribution we will expand into a product line that will express the Feminine Weapon ethos in a chic, artistic, and uplifting fashion.


Now I know what you're thinking, ""What is a Feminine Weapon?""Feminine Weapon is a selfless woman who uses her influence to positively change people and world around her. She's one who continues to seek greater knowledge, is always learning, and growing into a better version of herself. This task is never ending and her desire to receive is for the sake of sharing. She's a complete woman: charismatic, intelligent, honest, and ambitious, yet provocative and caring. When Feminine Weapon is channeled, dreams are within reach and darkness fades. Meet the TeamChristina Weber, Founder and Chief Visionary Christina Weber is the founder of and original Feminine Weapon. Ten years ago Christina made her way to New York from Maryland, seeking to begin her professional life in the land of endless opportunity. She successfully climbed the ladder working in sales, marketing and business development for established brands and start-ups. But she soon realized that the generous paycheck and accolades weren’t satisfying her inner calling. She found that calling in Feminine Weapon, and gave it all up to pursue this movement.Manuela Rana, Photographer and Creative DirectorManuela Rana is Feminine Weapon’s creative director. She hails from Italy where she worked as a fashion photographer. Since arriving in New York she’s worked alongside the best in the industry, including Antoine Verglas of Vogue and Victoria’s Secret fame. Her work can be seen on the Feminine Weapon website where she captured the inner light and unique beauty of each woman featured in the Feminine Weapon Day Interview Series.A.E. Fairfield, Content Director and WriterA.E. Fairfield (Ashley) is the content director and writer for Feminine Weapon. Originally from Nebraska, she now calls herself a New Yorker. She released her first novel, The Polaris Effect, last year to glowing reviews. She’s excited to be writing for Feminine Weapon and was especially inspired by the 25 fascinating women she had the opportunity to profile for the Feminine Weapon Day interview series.






What Do We Need and What Will We Do With Your Contribution?We’re developing Feminine Weapon into a lifestyle brand with an e-commerce platform and our own brand of goods. The money raised from this campaign will cover the production process and operating costs during this early phases of development. You're literally giving us a kick start. Last year, Christina worked with consultant Dana Fried to develop a strategy to launch an apparel brand. Although it was in reference to another venture, the education was the same, and the outcome was a plan which covered design, manufacturing, marketing, and sales. It was determined the necessary funding for launch would range between $75,000 and $100,000. Through creative cost-cutting and partnerships, we’ve determined it’s possible to launch the FW product line for around $50,000.With your contribution, we’ll not only be able to produce the first line, but also trademark and retain our creative director, writer, and bookkeeper. Given Christina’s expertise in marketing she’ll be handling the marketing and public relations. In return for your generosity, we’re offering the pre-purchase of our product line at a premium, unique experiences, and some personal time with us.About the Product LineFirst we'll recruit an artist to illustrate unique designs with our brand messages and supporting themes (see concepts below). The goal of the designs are to remind women of their inner Feminine Weapon, and inspire others to find theirs. A few of the concepts support initiatives that have spoken to our hearts and we believe are worthy of our help. A portion of our proceeds will go to these projects until they are fully funded. Products will be pre-produced for distribution at events, tradeshows, and partnering outlets and also printed on-demand, to avoid waste and keep our business sustainable. We will go out of our way to use only the highest quality materials and processes. When a product is ordered online, we produce it, package it and ship it - worldwide.The following items will be part of the first product launch:- Essentials line (tanks, tees, hoodies)- Wall Art- Totebags- Note Cards - Jewelry- Wine Stopper Design ConceptsAlthough we have not finalized any designs for the product line, we have concepts in mind inspired by our journey and community.FW : Logo themed This simple logo design will draw awareness to the movement and remind you that there is a cape on your back. No fears. You can fly. ""Aware of Her Life Desires and On a Mission to Fulfill Them""Ain't nothing going to hold back a Femininie Weapon. She's going for the gold just so she can she it with her people. This phase will be artistically laid out and will serve as your motto for life. If you don't know what you want, how can you get where you need to want to be.   This movement isn't about guns or violence. It's about seeing yourself as a weapon for the thoughts that you have and the energies you create. Inspired by Margot B's expression of Femininie Weapon, we'll work with our illustrator to graphically articulated this message in a cool, unique way through image and design. ""Arm Yourself With a Feminine Weapon""A few months ago a friend wrote this message on Christina's chalkboard wall and it has yet to wipe away. The Dalai Lama stated, “The World Will Be Saved By the Western Woman” and we agree. When you have a Feminine Weapon by your side, darkness turns to light, inspiration is shared, and change happens more quickly. Let's build a tsunami of women who all protect each other. ""Peace Park""Inspired by Activist Humaira Bachal, a panelist at Women in the World, a portion of the proceeds from the ""Peace Park"" graphic design will help fund the development of a park in one of the most dangerous slums in Pakistan. This park will provide children and parents a safe space to play in Karachi. ""Ambassador to the Moon"" A title given to Samantha Power, US Ambassador to the UN and humanitarian advocate, by her son will be the theme of this design. Balancing the problems of the world while being a good mother to her son, proves that it's possible to push for global change while still providing love and attentions to family and friends. Items from our product line may be available for pre-purchase in a perk package, including two other exclusive items:Feminine Weapon Wine StopperThe Femininie Weapon Wine Stopper was created by Kristin Aytona and given to Christina as a gift for her birthday in 2013. This limited edition piece is available to purchase in one of our perk packages. FW Stud EarringsThe Feminine Weapon earring set is currently in production in New York City's jewelry district. The ""FW"" will go in one ear and the kerambit knife in the other ear. Culturally, the kerambit was popular among Indonesian women who would tie the weapon into their hair to be used in self-defense. Still to this day, silat practitioners regard it as a FEMININE WEAPON.Besides Selling Products and Goods, How Do We Profit as a Business?

<div></div></div>","The Golden Passage - A Bike Journey on the Royal Road in Brazil 

 New York-based Brazilian photographer Eliseu Cavalcante is working on a documentary photo project which aims to promote the rich history of the Estrada Real, or Royal Road. The Estrada Real refers to any land that was in the process of settlement and economic exploitation during Brazil’s colonial period. The Royal Road was the only authorized way to move people and goods to the international market. Portuguese colonists in Brazil and African slaves began building the road in 1697 shortly after gold, diamonds, and other precious minerals were discovered in the present-day state of Minas Gerais. The road facilitated the movement of these resources to the coast and later, to Europe.
After the great success of his last project Esperança Terena, about a indigenous tribe in Brazil, with exhibitions at the Americas Society and Council of the Americas, Brazilian Consulate in New York and at Espasso's gallery also in New York, he decided to continue promoting the Brazilian culture outside of Brazil.
In order to be close to his subject, Cavalcante decided to carry out this project in a different way; he will ride his bike on  the Caminho Velho (Old Trail) - 441 miles between the city of Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais and Paraty, Rio de Janeiro. During this trip, he will document the landscape, architecture, culture, history and people of the Estrada Real . Cavalcante believes that the beauty of the Estrada Real makes it one of the most interesting places to travel in Brazil. In addition to the magnificent landscape, the history behind the trails is inspiring. Cavalcante will shoot photos of both landscapes and people to show that the precious minerals are not the land’s real riches.




Samples of previous projects




Esperança
Terena: I did this
project in 2013. The project aims to bring awareness about the issue of
indigenous land rights in Brazil. You can see more photos and info here.







Sewage
in Rio de Janeiro: This
photograph is part of a project that Rachel Glickhouse, my wife, and I did for
GlobalPost in Rio de Janeiro about the water quality/sanitation problem in
Guanabara Bay. The project led us into Rocinha, Latin America’s largest slum.

Trip and Project Details



We are planning to do this project at the end of January
2015. It will be a 2.5 or 3 week journey, depending on weather conditions,
riding the 441 miles from Ouro Preto (Minas Gerais) to Paraty (Rio de Janeiro).
Of the 441 miles, the route is divided by:10% paved
roads, 1.5% rocks (old pavement), 6% trails, and 82.5% unpaved road (dirt).


The main focus is to share with the world the history of the
Estrada Real through images and text. 
We will be shooting portraits and conducting interviews,
from the rural areas down to the coast, with the people who are the direct
descendants of the  slaves who actually built the road and the people who
moved from different states searching for gold and precious minerals. Those
portraits will show how people live in 2014, around 300 years after the road
started to be built.
Along the original winding road and within the irregular
layout following the contours of the landscape lie squares, buildings,
residences, fountains, bridges and churches which showcase Baroque
architecture. Many of the towns are listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites due to their beauty and cultural
significance.

We really need your help to make this beautiful
work to come alive!

<h2>A 66-block and 110-block tool on your keychain? Too good to be true!</h2>
<p><strong>If you're like me,</strong> you often find yourself having to deal with phone or data wiring unexpectedly, without your toolkit handy.</p>
<h3>Wouldn't it be nice if your toolkit fit on a keychain? </h3>
<p>This Keychain Punchdown Tool is the first step towards that. Slip it into your pocket next to your favorite multi-tool and you'll never have to wedge your screwdriver into a 66-block again, nor lug around a huge toolkit everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>Complete your keychain kit with the fine <a href=""http://www.smartronixstore.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&amp;Category_id=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SuperLooper</a> and <a href=""http://www.leatherman.com/product/Squirt_E4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leatherman Squirt</a> (I'm not affiliated with them in any way.)</strong></p>
<p>The Keychain Punchdown uses the<strong> same twist-lock bits</strong> and locking mechanism that your favorite full-size tool uses, but replaces the bulky handle with a minimalist aluminum handle. The keychain D-ring rotates out of the way to let you hold the rounded back of the tool in your palm and punch wires into 110- and 66-blocks to your heart's content.</p>
<p>In fact, my experience with the prototype shows that with a sharp bit this tool can actually provide<strong> better handling and require less energy;</strong> the typical spring-loaded mechanisms are frequently overkill and under-precise. With this tool, you simply press the cutting side into the panel and feel the satisfying snap of the wire, no grunting or loud noises! When the bit eventually it gets dull, industry-standard replacement blades are readily available at your favorite store or online.</p>
<p><strong>Make your coworkers jealous! Be quick on the draw with this tool and future keychain telecom tools forthcoming.</strong></p>
<p>Your support to make this happen (and feedback to improve the state of our industry) is super awesome and appreciated!</p>
<h3>Q&amp;A:</h3>
<p><strong>Will the sharp bit poke me in the leg?</strong><br/>Not likely! I've been carrying the above-pictured prototype in my pocket for months; in fact it's in my pocket now and I don't notice it next to my keychain Leatherman. The bit is sharp, but then again keys aren't exactly cuddly themselves. In any case I've had no discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>The tool should have a cap!<br/></strong>Good suggestion! However, this will add to production cost and caps tend to get lost anyway (see: thumb drive caps.) Plus, I'm a big fan of simplicity and I haven't wished for a cap since putting this thing in my pocket months ago...</p>

STRETCH GOALS
 

 

 
70 ITEMS TO COVER ALL MAJOR EMERGENCIES


When it comes to survival gear, first aid kits are one of the most overlooked preparedness items out there. We know, they aren’t as fun to talk about as survival knives, bug out bags, and firearms; but when it comes to practical emergency preparedness items, the reality of the situation is that your medical kit is probably going to get more use that any other items in your survival stash.

I love sports, especially football and running. I've always dreamed of running a marathon! My dream will soon come true and I’m going take on this challenge by taking part in the highly prestigious Orlen Warsaw Marathon on April 23!</p><p>For more information, visit: <a href=""https://www.orlenmarathon.pl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.orlenmarathon.pl</a></p><p>Another passion of mine is traveling. Two years ago in March we went on a trip to Asia and Cambodia was one of the destinations. We stayed in a small cozy hotel in Siem Reap. We decided to rent a tuk tuk along with the driver (tuk tuk is a small motorbike with a trailer to carry people) for the whole day so that he could show us around. It cost only about $10 for the entire day, which we paid at the hotel’s front desk. We quickly got along with Bunhak, as that was the our driver’s name. After the day full of sightseeing in the Angkor Wat temples, we asked him to drive us to a restaurant to get some local food. Buhnak admitted he had to take us to a place that would tip him for bringing in customers. We didn’t mind and we even invited him to dinner. We ended up paying around $50 for 5 people I could see how shocked he was when we were paying the bill as he would probably be able to live on that money for quite some time. This is when another idea came to our mind, fueled perhaps by the curiosity to learn about other cultures. We asked him if he would like to have his mom, or wife, prepare a meal for us the following day, and we would pay them $50 for the treat. We knew this could mean that for a few days to come they wouldn’t need to worry about making ends meet. Bunhak, right away, thought it was a great idea. The very same evening we booked a one-day ride at the hotel, stressing that we would like to get the same driver. Thus, we were sure to have a great adventure to look forward to the following day. The tuk tuk was waiting for us the next morning, parked in front of the hotel. We first went to see the sites we still had left, and after that we went to Bunhak's place. He explained that he lived outside the city and the road would lead through villages, providing a view slightly different than there in the city. We were thrilled because we were hungry for an adventure. After about an hour's journey, with the last few minutes crossed through the jungle, we arrived in a small village consisting of no more than six small houses. We realized that was where he lived. We were greeted by so many children one could easily think there were at least 15 houses there, It turned out that even the neighbors were involved in welcoming us. The experience was truly fantastic, festive. The food itself was spectacular and words can’t do justice to the enthusiasm we were received with by the locals. Bunhak told us a bit more about himself. We learned that after his father died he was the only one to support his family and the only one with a job. He has to provide for his two sisters, his mother, his wife, his baby and another one on the way. Our offer, therefore, came him really in handy financially, while, to us, it was simply an incredible experience. We asked him about his work. He revealed that his motorbike was leased and he was paying the owner a lot of money to use it. We can only guess how much he earns on the whole deal since we were paying about $10 for the entire day, and then there’s gasoline and rental fees. Fortunately, the majority of tourists will throw in something extra.</p><p>It was already when Bunhak was telling us about the terms of his cooperation with the hotel that I decided in my mind that someday I would get money to buy him his own tuk tuk and I would go back to Cambodia and give it to him filled with joy!</p><p>When I began training for the marathon, I ran a longer distance of about 20km once a week.

I mars to år siden har jeg vært på en reise rundt Asia. Et av målene var Kambodsja. Der bodde vi i en liten hotell i byen Siem Reap. Vi har bestemt oss å leie «tuk tuk» sammen med en sjåfør (tuk tuk – det er en liten motorsykker med vogn for å sjøre folk) for hele dagen for at han skulle vise oss rundt. Det kostet bare 10 dollar for hele dagen og vi betalte i hotellet. Vi har rask fått kontakt med Bunhak – sjåføren. Etter hele dagen der vi besøkte hellige plasser Angkor Wat, ba vi ham å kjøre oss til noen lokale steder som restauranter. Buhnak innrømte at han må kjøre oss til en restaurant der han skal få noe ekstra for det at han kom med kunder. Vi hadde ingenting imot det og vi har invitert han til middag. For 5 personer betalte vi noe rundt 50 dollar, og da vi betalte regningen så jeg at han var sjokkert fordi det var veldig store penger for ham. Da kom jeg på en ide, og var nysgjerrig å bli kjent med andre kulturer. Jeg spurte ham om det skulle være problem vis hans mor eller kona skulle lage middag for oss neste dag og vi skulle betale 50 dollar. Vi viste at da skal de ikke bry seg om det at de skal ikke ha penger til de neste dagene. Bunhak hadde ingenting imot og sa at det var veldig bra ide. Samme dag reserverte vi heldags tur og sa at vi ville ha samme sjåfør. Neste dag ventet tuk tuk på oss. Vi dro først å besøke de plassene som vi ikke hadde tid å se dagen før og så dro vi til Bunhak. Han forklarte oss at han bor utenfor byen og at veien går gjennom landsbygder og at vi skal ha annerledes utsikt enn den i byen. Vi var veldig glad for det fordi vi forventet et eventyr. Cirka en time senere, og de siste minuttene gjennom jungelen så vi en liten landsby, der til sammen var det ca. 6 små hus. Da vi kom på plass, kom alle barna rundt. Det var så mange av dem om det skulle være 15 hus. På plass merkte vi at til og med var naboene involverte å lage mat til oss. Det var virkelig fantastisk. Maten var deilig og folk var veldig glad. Det går ikke ann å beskrive denne følelsen. Vi fikk vite att etter farens død, tjener Bunhak som den eneste i familien. Han må ta vare på to søstre, mora, kona, barnet og et til barn som skulle snart fødes. Så vår tilbud var veldig god for dem og for oss var det en veldig bra erfaring. Vi har spurt ham om hans erfaring. Han sa til oss at motorsykkelen er leid og at han må betale store penger for leie. Vi kan bare tenke oss hvor mye han tjener siden vi betalte ham bare 10 dollar for hele dagen, tenk på bensin og leie.  Heldigvis skjer det at noen turister gir han mer.</p><p> </p><p>Da Bunhak fortalte oss hvordan er hans samarbeid med hotellet, bestemte jeg i mine tanker at en dag skal jeg skaffe penger for helt ny Tuk Tuk for ham og komme tilbake til Kambodsja, for å gi den til ham.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491690961/f6zvsr3qzcqdo8vdkgoe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Da jeg begynte å trene til løpet, en gang i uken løpet jeg lengre distanse, ca. 20 kilometer.

Kocham sport! Piłka nożna i bieganie to dziedziny, na które poświęciłem najwięcej czasu. Zawsze marzyłem o tym, aby przebiec maraton! Niebawem moje marzenie się spełni i podejmę się tego wyzwania, gdyż 23 kwietnia wezmę udział w bardzo prestiżowym Orlen Warsaw Marathon!<br/><br/>Więcej informacji znajdziesz tutaj: <a href=""https://www.orlenmarathon.pl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.orlenmarathon.pl</a><br/><br/>Moją drugą pasją są podróże. W marcu przed dwoma laty byliśmy na wyprawie po Azji. Jednym z celów była Kambodża. Tam zakwaterowaliśmy się w małym, kameralnym hotelu w mieście Siem Reap. Postanowiliśmy wynająć tuk tuka wraz z kierowcą (mały motor z podłączoną przyczepą w celu przewozu osób) na cały dzień, aby pokazał nam okolicę. Był to koszt zaledwie ok. 10 dolarów za cały dzień, które to płaciliśmy w hotelowej recepcji. Szybko znaleźliśmy wspólny język z Bunhakiem, bo tak nazywał się kierowca. Po dniu pełnym zwiedzania świątyń Angkor wat, poprosiliśmy go, aby zawiózł nas do jakiejś restauracji, aby zjeść coś lokalnego. Buhnak przyznał, że musi nas zawieźć do knajpy, z której otrzyma jakąś dolę za to, że załatwił klientów. Nie mieliśmy nic przeciwko. Zaprosiliśmy go również na obiad. Za 5 osób zapłaciliśmy coś około 50 dolarów i kiedy płaciliśmy, widziałem, że to był dla niego szok, albowiem za te pieniądze musiał pewnie wyżyć kawał czasu. I tu pojawił się kolejny pomysł, a zarazem dała znać o sobie ciekawość innych kultur. Zapytaliśmy go czy nie zechciałby, aby to jego Mama, bądź żona przygotowała dla nas posiłek dnia następnego, a my zapłacimy im te 50 dolarów. Wiedzieliśmy bowiem, że to może znaczyć, że przez kolejne dni nie będą musieli się martwić, co mają do garnka wsadzić. Bunhak bez namysłu uznał to za świetny pomysł. Jeszcze tego samego dnia wieczorem, zarezerwowaliśmy kurs całodniowy w hotelu i zaznaczyliśmy, że zależy nam na tym samym kierowcy i już mogliśmy mieć pewność, że czeka nas jutro świetna przygoda. Następnego dnia rano tuk tuk czekał już zaparkowany przed hotelem. Ruszyliśmy najpierw zwiedzić te miejsca, które nam pozostały, a zaraz po tym udaliśmy się w podróż do domu Bunhaka. Wytłumaczył nam, że mieszka poza miastem, a droga będzie prowadziła przez wioski i będzie to nieco inny widok niż tu w mieście. Nas to zachwyciło, albowiem byliśmy rządni przygody. Po około godzinnej podróży, a ostatnie kilka minut dżunglą, gdzie w jej głębi usytuowana była mała wioska składająca się z około 6 małych domków, dotarliśmy na miejsce. Dzieci przyszło do nas jednak tyle, jakby tych domów stało tam 15. Na miejscu okazało się, że nawet sąsiedzi byli zaangażowani w przygotowanie dla nas gościny. Było na prawdę fantastycznie, odświętnie. Jedzenie pierwsza klasa, entuzjazm z jakim przyjęli nas mieszkańcy był nie do opisania. Tam Bunhak opowiedział nam nieco więcej o sobie. Dowiedzieliśmy się, że po śmierci ojca, to on utrzymuje rodzinę i jako jedyny ma pracę. Ma na utrzymaniu dwie siostry, mamę, żonę, dziecko i kolejne w drodze. Także nasza propozycja była dla nich olbrzymią pomocą, a dla nas niesamowitym doświadczeniem. Zapytaliśmy go jeszcze o jego pracę. Zdradził nam, że motor jest w leasingu i płaci właścicielowi spore pieniądze za możliwość jego użytkowania. Możemy tylko się domyślać ile on zarabia na całym interesie skoro my płaciliśmy około 10 dolarów za cały dzień, a gdzie tu paliwo i wynajem tego pojazdu. Na szczęście znaczna część turystów dorzuci coś ekstra.<br/><br/>Już w momencie, gdy Bunhak opowiadał nam na jakiej zasadzie jest jego współpraca z hotelem, już wtedy postanowiłem sobie w myślach, że kiedyś zdobędę pieniądze na własnego tuk tuka dla niego i wrócę tu do Kambodży, żeby z olbrzymią radością mu go wręczyć!<br/><br/>Kiedy zacząłem trenować do maratonu, raz w tygodniu biegałem dłuższy dystans, około 20km. Miałem ponad 2 godziny na przemyślenia. W trakcie jednego z treningów załapało. Pomyślałem sobie: a może by tak zrobić coś ekstra do tego biegu??? Dosłownie w mgnieniu oka przyszedł mi na myśl tuk tuk dla Bunhaka. W ten sposób powstał projekt, który stał się moim marzeniem numer 1 i nic mnie powstrzyma, by je zrealizować! Jak mnie wyproszą drzwiami, wejdę oknem!<br/><br/>Postanowiłem znaleźć firmy, a także osoby prywatne, które w sytuacji, gdy uda mi się ukończyć maraton, zgodzą się weprzeć zakup tuk tuka dla Bunhaka. Później pozostaje mi tak się przygotować fizycznie, aby wybiegać ten motor dla naszego przyjaciela. Jestem tak zmotywowany, że nawet w sytuacji kiedy padnę, będę się czołgał ku mecie! <br/><br/>Uwielbiam kręcić filmy z podróży i montować je w całość. Niezwykle silnie zaczęło mnie to wkręcać. Bardzo mocno chcę nakręcić film z tego wyjazdu do Kambodży! Byłby to swego rodzaju amatorski film dokumentalny, gdzie jednym z wątków byłby dzień z życia takiego kierowcy Tuk tuka w Kambodży. Buhnak miałby zagrać w tym filmie i tam w jednej z ostatnich scen miałoby nastąpić niespodziewane wręczenie pojazdu dla niego. Niespodziewane, ponieważ on nie ma o niczym pojęcia. Nawiązałem kontakt z jego siostrą i ona utrzymuje projekt w tajemnicy, a jedyne o czym Buhnak wie, to fakt, że przybędziemy do Kambodży w celu nakręcenia filmu, a on będzie naszym kierowcą podczas pobytu.<br/><br/>W celu wyjazdu do Kambodży i realizacji filmu,a także pozyskania środków na ten pojazd, rejestrujemy projekt na platformie crowdfundingowej. Tu wszyscy chętni, którym pomysł przypadł do gustu mogą wesprzeć pomysł finansowo, a tym samym przybliżyć nas do celu. Koszt realizacji całego projektu jest jak dla nas kosmiczny, dlatego liczmy na Waszą przychylność! Razem możemy więcej! Prócz zakupu tuk tuka musimy zgromadzić środki na:<br/><br/>Bilety lotnicze, zakwaterowanie, wizy, transport na miejscu, sprzęt, tłumaczy, wynagrodzenie za pomoc lokalnych mieszkańców w realizacji filmu i dla jego bohaterów.<br/><br/>Prócz mnie w wyprawie weźmie udział montażysta filmowy, a jeśli zbierzemy nieco ponad 100% potrzebnej kwoty, to dołączy do nas fotograf, aby film był możliwie najlepszy. Otrzymacie relację na bieżąco z każdego dnia wyjazdu, tak abyście i Wy mogli żyć tym wydarzeniem. <br/><br/>O wsparcie projektu będę obiegał się zarówno tu, gdzie obecnie mieszkam, w Norwegii, jak i w mojej ojczyźnie Polsce. Dlatego film ukaże się w języku polskim z angielskimi napisami, gdyż zdecydowana większość Norwegów mówi świetnie w tym języku. W ten sposób dotrzemy do widowni nie tylko w Polsce i Norwegii, ale i każdego innego kraju, gdzie język angielski jest znany.<br/><br/>Jeśli podoba się Tobie nasz pomysł i masz kilka złotówek, którymi z chęcią wsparłbyś ten projekt, to będzie nam niezwykle miło jeśli to uczynisz! Pamiętaj, że karma wraca! <br/><br/>Zaplanowaliśmy, że zabierzemy ze sobą jeden bagaż ekstra z zabawkami dla kambodżańskich dzieci, prześlemy zdjęcia radosnych buziek dzieci, które je otrzymają. I Ty możesz mieć udział w uszczęśliwieniu ich. Za wszelką okazaną pomoc z góry dziękujemy i wszystkich kolejno skromnie nagrodzimy za ten wspaniały gest! Śledź nas na Facebooku!<br/><br/>W razie jakichkolwiek pytań pisz do nas o każdej porze, odpowiemy!<br/><br/>Serdecznie pozdrawiamy!

I love sports, especially football and running. I've always dreamed of running a marathon! My dream will soon come true and I’m going take on this challenge by taking part in the highly prestigious Orlen Warsaw Marathon on April 23!For more information, visit: https://www.orlenmarathon.plAnother passion of mine is traveling. Two years ago in March we went on a trip to Asia and Cambodia was one of the destinations. We stayed in a small cozy hotel in Siem Reap. We decided to rent a tuk tuk along with the driver (tuk tuk is a small motorbike with a trailer to carry people) for the whole day so that he could show us around. It cost only about $10 for the entire day, which we paid at the hotel’s front desk. We quickly got along with Bunhak, as that was the our driver’s name. After the day full of sightseeing in the Angkor Wat temples, we asked him to drive us to a restaurant to get some local food. Buhnak admitted he had to take us to a place that would tip him for bringing in customers. We didn’t mind and we even invited him to dinner. We ended up paying around $50 for 5 people I could see how shocked he was when we were paying the bill as he would probably be able to live on that money for quite some time. This is when another idea came to our mind, fueled perhaps by the curiosity to learn about other cultures. We asked him if he would like to have his mom, or wife, prepare a meal for us the following day, and we would pay them $50 for the treat. We knew this could mean that for a few days to come they wouldn’t need to worry about making ends meet. Bunhak, right away, thought it was a great idea. The very same evening we booked a one-day ride at the hotel, stressing that we would like to get the same driver. Thus, we were sure to have a great adventure to look forward to the following day. The tuk tuk was waiting for us the next morning, parked in front of the hotel. We first went to see the sites we still had left, and after that we went to Bunhak's place. He explained that he lived outside the city and the road would lead through villages, providing a view slightly different than there in the city. We were thrilled because we were hungry for an adventure. After about an hour's journey, with the last few minutes crossed through the jungle, we arrived in a small village consisting of no more than six small houses. We realized that was where he lived. We were greeted by so many children one could easily think there were at least 15 houses there, It turned out that even the neighbors were involved in welcoming us. The experience was truly fantastic, festive. The food itself was spectacular and words can’t do justice to the enthusiasm we were received with by the locals. Bunhak told us a bit more about himself. We learned that after his father died he was the only one to support his family and the only one with a job. He has to provide for his two sisters, his mother, his wife, his baby and another one on the way. Our offer, therefore, came him really in handy financially, while, to us, it was simply an incredible experience. We asked him about his work. He revealed that his motorbike was leased and he was paying the owner a lot of money to use it. We can only guess how much he earns on the whole deal since we were paying about $10 for the entire day, and then there’s gasoline and rental fees. Fortunately, the majority of tourists will throw in something extra.It was already when Bunhak was telling us about the terms of his cooperation with the hotel that I decided in my mind that someday I would get money to buy him his own tuk tuk and I would go back to Cambodia and give it to him filled with joy!When I began training for the marathon, I ran a longer distance of about 20km once a week. I had more than two hours to think. It finally dawned on me during one of the sessions: perhaps I could do something more than just run this race. A tuk tuk for Bunhak almost immediately came to my mind. And that’s how the project that went to become my #1 dream was born and nothing can stop me from making it come true! If they throw me out the door, I will come back through the window!I decided to find companies that would agree to donate for the tuk tuk for Bunhak provided that I finish the marathon. If I find them, all I have to do is get in shape so that I can run that tuk tuk out for my friend. I’m so motivated that even if I fall on the ground, I will crawl to the finish line! I love to film and edit travel videos, and I’ve gotten into it rather seriously.

På denne måten skulle mer folk se filmen, der man snakker engelsk. Om du liker idean vårt og har lyst å støtte oss, du kan gjerne gå inn på indiegogo.com der vi smaler pengene. Hvis du driver et firma og du vil bli med, skrov til oss og si at hvis jeg løper maraton, skal du støtte oss. Hver person som skal delta kan forvente en belønning. Logoen til firmaet ditt skal også være synnlig i slutten av filmen. Om alt skal gå bra og jeg skal gjøre alt for at det skal gå bra, skal vi begynne reisen vår i mai/juni. Hele filmen skal vi sette sammen når vi kommer tilbake, men hver dag skal vi legge ut en kort film. Har du spørsmål? Spør! Hilser! Run for Happiness crew! Success!!! Polska Wersja!Nazywam się Tomasz Kubacki, od 5 lat wspólnie z rodziną mieszkam w Stavanger (Norwegia). Kocham sport! Piłka nożna i bieganie to dziedziny, na które poświęciłem najwięcej czasu. Zawsze marzyłem o tym, aby przebiec maraton! Niebawem moje marzenie się spełni i podejmę się tego wyzwania, gdyż 23 kwietnia wezmę udział w bardzo prestiżowym Orlen Warsaw Marathon!Więcej informacji znajdziesz tutaj: https://www.orlenmarathon.plMoją drugą pasją są podróże. W marcu przed dwoma laty byliśmy na wyprawie po Azji. Jednym z celów była Kambodża. Tam zakwaterowaliśmy się w małym, kameralnym hotelu w mieście Siem Reap. Postanowiliśmy wynająć tuk tuka wraz z kierowcą (mały motor z podłączoną przyczepą w celu przewozu osób) na cały dzień, aby pokazał nam okolicę. Był to koszt zaledwie ok. 10 dolarów za cały dzień, które to płaciliśmy w hotelowej recepcji. Szybko znaleźliśmy wspólny język z Bunhakiem, bo tak nazywał się kierowca. Po dniu pełnym zwiedzania świątyń Angkor wat, poprosiliśmy go, aby zawiózł nas do jakiejś restauracji, aby zjeść coś lokalnego. Buhnak przyznał, że musi nas zawieźć do knajpy, z której otrzyma jakąś dolę za to, że załatwił klientów. Nie mieliśmy nic przeciwko. Zaprosiliśmy go również na obiad. Za 5 osób zapłaciliśmy coś około 50 dolarów i kiedy płaciliśmy, widziałem, że to był dla niego szok, albowiem za te pieniądze musiał pewnie wyżyć kawał czasu. I tu pojawił się kolejny pomysł, a zarazem dała znać o sobie ciekawość innych kultur. Zapytaliśmy go czy nie zechciałby, aby to jego Mama, bądź żona przygotowała dla nas posiłek dnia następnego, a my zapłacimy im te 50 dolarów. Wiedzieliśmy bowiem, że to może znaczyć, że przez kolejne dni nie będą musieli się martwić, co mają do garnka wsadzić. Bunhak bez namysłu uznał to za świetny pomysł. Jeszcze tego samego dnia wieczorem, zarezerwowaliśmy kurs całodniowy w hotelu i zaznaczyliśmy, że zależy nam na tym samym kierowcy i już mogliśmy mieć pewność, że czeka nas jutro świetna przygoda. Następnego dnia rano tuk tuk czekał już zaparkowany przed hotelem. Ruszyliśmy najpierw zwiedzić te miejsca, które nam pozostały, a zaraz po tym udaliśmy się w podróż do domu Bunhaka. Wytłumaczył nam, że mieszka poza miastem, a droga będzie prowadziła przez wioski i będzie to nieco inny widok niż tu w mieście. Nas to zachwyciło, albowiem byliśmy rządni przygody. Po około godzinnej podróży, a ostatnie kilka minut dżunglą, gdzie w jej głębi usytuowana była mała wioska składająca się z około 6 małych domków, dotarliśmy na miejsce. Dzieci przyszło do nas jednak tyle, jakby tych domów stało tam 15. Na miejscu okazało się, że nawet sąsiedzi byli zaangażowani w przygotowanie dla nas gościny. Było na prawdę fantastycznie, odświętnie. Jedzenie pierwsza klasa, entuzjazm z jakim przyjęli nas mieszkańcy był nie do opisania. Tam Bunhak opowiedział nam nieco więcej o sobie. Dowiedzieliśmy się, że po śmierci ojca, to on utrzymuje rodzinę i jako jedyny ma pracę. Ma na utrzymaniu dwie siostry, mamę, żonę, dziecko i kolejne w drodze. Także nasza propozycja była dla nich olbrzymią pomocą, a dla nas niesamowitym doświadczeniem. Zapytaliśmy go jeszcze o jego pracę. Zdradził nam, że motor jest w leasingu i płaci właścicielowi spore pieniądze za możliwość jego użytkowania. Możemy tylko się domyślać ile on zarabia na całym interesie skoro my płaciliśmy około 10 dolarów za cały dzień, a gdzie tu paliwo i wynajem tego pojazdu. Na szczęście znaczna część turystów dorzuci coś ekstra.Już w momencie, gdy Bunhak opowiadał nam na jakiej zasadzie jest jego współpraca z hotelem, już wtedy postanowiłem sobie w myślach, że kiedyś zdobędę pieniądze na własnego tuk tuka dla niego i wrócę tu do Kambodży, żeby z olbrzymią radością mu go wręczyć!Kiedy zacząłem trenować do maratonu, raz w tygodniu biegałem dłuższy dystans, około 20km. Miałem ponad 2 godziny na przemyślenia. W trakcie jednego z treningów załapało. Pomyślałem sobie: a może by tak zrobić coś ekstra do tego biegu??? Dosłownie w mgnieniu oka przyszedł mi na myśl tuk tuk dla Bunhaka. W ten sposób powstał projekt, który stał się moim marzeniem numer 1 i nic mnie powstrzyma, by je zrealizować! Jak mnie wyproszą drzwiami, wejdę oknem!Postanowiłem znaleźć firmy, a także osoby prywatne, które w sytuacji, gdy uda mi się ukończyć maraton, zgodzą się weprzeć zakup tuk tuka dla Bunhaka. Później pozostaje mi tak się przygotować fizycznie, aby wybiegać ten motor dla naszego przyjaciela. Jestem tak zmotywowany, że nawet w sytuacji kiedy padnę, będę się czołgał ku mecie! Uwielbiam kręcić filmy z podróży i montować je w całość. Niezwykle silnie zaczęło mnie to wkręcać. Bardzo mocno chcę nakręcić film z tego wyjazdu do Kambodży! Byłby to swego rodzaju amatorski film dokumentalny, gdzie jednym z wątków byłby dzień z życia takiego kierowcy Tuk tuka w Kambodży. Buhnak miałby zagrać w tym filmie i tam w jednej z ostatnich scen miałoby nastąpić niespodziewane wręczenie pojazdu dla niego. Niespodziewane, ponieważ on nie ma o niczym pojęcia. Nawiązałem kontakt z jego siostrą i ona utrzymuje projekt w tajemnicy, a jedyne o czym Buhnak wie, to fakt, że przybędziemy do Kambodży w celu nakręcenia filmu, a on będzie naszym kierowcą podczas pobytu.W celu wyjazdu do Kambodży i realizacji filmu,a także pozyskania środków na ten pojazd, rejestrujemy projekt na platformie crowdfundingowej. Tu wszyscy chętni, którym pomysł przypadł do gustu mogą wesprzeć pomysł finansowo, a tym samym przybliżyć nas do celu. Koszt realizacji całego projektu jest jak dla nas kosmiczny, dlatego liczmy na Waszą przychylność! Razem możemy więcej! Prócz zakupu tuk tuka musimy zgromadzić środki na:Bilety lotnicze, zakwaterowanie, wizy, transport na miejscu, sprzęt, tłumaczy, wynagrodzenie za pomoc lokalnych mieszkańców w realizacji filmu i dla jego bohaterów.Prócz mnie w wyprawie weźmie udział montażysta filmowy, a jeśli zbierzemy nieco ponad 100% potrzebnej kwoty, to dołączy do nas fotograf, aby film był możliwie najlepszy. Otrzymacie relację na bieżąco z każdego dnia wyjazdu, tak abyście i Wy mogli żyć tym wydarzeniem. O wsparcie projektu będę obiegał się zarówno tu, gdzie obecnie mieszkam, w Norwegii, jak i w mojej ojczyźnie Polsce. Dlatego film ukaże się w języku polskim z angielskimi napisami, gdyż zdecydowana większość Norwegów mówi świetnie w tym języku. W ten sposób dotrzemy do widowni nie tylko w Polsce i Norwegii, ale i każdego innego kraju, gdzie język angielski jest znany.Jeśli podoba się Tobie nasz pomysł i masz kilka złotówek, którymi z chęcią wsparłbyś ten projekt, to będzie nam niezwykle miło jeśli to uczynisz! Pamiętaj, że karma wraca! Zaplanowaliśmy, że zabierzemy ze sobą jeden bagaż ekstra z zabawkami dla kambodżańskich dzieci, prześlemy zdjęcia radosnych buziek dzieci, które je otrzymają. I Ty możesz mieć udział w uszczęśliwieniu ich. Za wszelką okazaną pomoc z góry dziękujemy i wszystkich kolejno skromnie nagrodzimy za ten wspaniały gest! Śledź nas na Facebooku!W razie jakichkolwiek pytań pisz do nas o każdej porze, odpowiemy!Serdecznie pozdrawiamy!

Traditional snorkel masks only allow for one constrained passage way for air through the mouth. Flowtech™ has two chambers and 4 intake valves to allow air to circulate in and out freely. This creates airflow with less resistance and more fresh air circulating through the mask. More fresh airflow and better circulation means less fogging, better visibility and more confident breathing. The benefits of our innovative Flowtech™ system ultimately result in a much more enjoyable and safer snorkeling experience.</p><div data-id=""20493609""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1522952863/qmpxa3bkabstp8efujuz.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""20776859""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1100550116/seaview-180-sv2-elevate-your-snorkeling-experience/pledge/new?clicked_reward=false&amp;ref=nav_search&amp;refresh=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1522952863/rf10culcpbdvbwvhfsm1.jpg"" src=""""/> </a></figure></div><div data-id=""20493614""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1522952864/lvnhdfcvywfmnanxey7e.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""20492812""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1522952865/baddfuecnupa8i6ibaev.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""20328758""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1522952866/enjxogk9qzulvsqmv2j8.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h1> </h1><h1>Commitment<b> to Safety Testing</b>
</h1><p>The SV2 provides unmatched design and performance enhancing the snorkeling experience on every level. Improving the overall usability and performance of your snorkeling mask not only makes your snorkeling experience way more enjoyable, but much safer as well.  </p><p>We conducted computational fluid dynamics testing on the SV2 model to measure airflow resistance and CO2 buildup. The results show airflow resistance that is well within EN250 work of breathing standards. Low resistance airflow allows fresh oxygen into the mask at high rates and provides a comfortable breathing experience. This airflow, along with 5 one-way check valves, reduces and keeps CO2 levels well within safe limits. We continue to test using more instrumentation as they become available to us. </p><div data-id=""20468816""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1522952866/hpwkqvy2cgwoi0ci3etx.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""20393751""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1522952867/l6m3ejrhlycftuvq9aqw.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""20493622""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1522952868/vdzds9pfhksopcbwwddd.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""20492835""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1522952869/knp8cdnuy63m09bbd6zy.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""20492601""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1522952869/jxpqphxzfpiqfjrg0pna.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>We set out to make a product that would revolutionize the snorkeling experience.

The SV2 drastically improves breathability, enhances the viewing area and adds several quality features to create an unmatched snorkeling experience. We heavily focused on airflow to maximize safety. With over a year and a half of design and engineering behind the concept, as well as 8 rounds of prototyping, testing and fine-tuning, the SV2 is primed and ready to launch Wildhorn and the snorkeling adventure experience to the next level.PLEASE NOTE: The swimmers shown in our video are experts. This is a surface snorkel mask not intended for serious free diving. Crowdfunding will help fund final tooling, sizing molds and other design adjustments to ensure that the product is completely dialed in for the best possible experience for our customers. Funds will also help to cover first round production costs to meet the demand for this innovative new product.MAXIMUM FRESH AIR INTAKE Our patent pending Flowtech™ system provides natural breathing through both your nose and mouth. Traditional snorkel masks only allow for one constrained passage way for air through the mouth. Flowtech™ has two chambers and 4 intake valves to allow air to circulate in and out freely. This creates airflow with less resistance and more fresh air circulating through the mask. More fresh airflow and better circulation means less fogging, better visibility and more confident breathing. The benefits of our innovative Flowtech™ system ultimately result in a much more enjoyable and safer snorkeling experience.  Commitment to Safety Testing
The SV2 provides unmatched design and performance enhancing the snorkeling experience on every level. Improving the overall usability and performance of your snorkeling mask not only makes your snorkeling experience way more enjoyable, but much safer as well.  We conducted computational fluid dynamics testing on the SV2 model to measure airflow resistance and CO2 buildup. The results show airflow resistance that is well within EN250 work of breathing standards. Low resistance airflow allows fresh oxygen into the mask at high rates and provides a comfortable breathing experience. This airflow, along with 5 one-way check valves, reduces and keeps CO2 levels well within safe limits. We continue to test using more instrumentation as they become available to us.  We set out to make a product that would revolutionize the snorkeling experience. We have spent the last year and a half meticulously designing, developing, testing and engineering the SV2. After over 18 months of research and dozens of prototypes, we are ready to introduce the SV2 to the world. Below are just a few initial sketches, renderings and prototype samples...OUR FIRST FULL FACE SNORKEL MASK IS CURRENTLY #1 ON AMAZON.In just over two years, we’ve established the Wildhorn brand as one of the fastest growing outdoor/adventure companies in the industry and have become a top seller in the outdoor segment on Amazon. Wildhorn Outfitters helped to pioneer the full-face snorkel mask revolution with our original Seaview 180° which quickly became the #1 seller on Amazon in the category with currently over 1,500 5 star reviews.THE MOST UNIQUE, HIGH PERFORMANCE SNORKELING PRODUCT EVER.The Seaview 180° SV2 simplifies and improves the snorkeling experience on every level. Our goal with the SV2 was to improve fit, maximize breathability, improve usability and create a unique, stylish form and finish. Our product team boasts 20+ years of design and production experience. We started from the ground up by identifying and understanding all issues related to each problem through studying consumer feedback from our current Seaview model, testing new concepts, snorkeling with prototypes and meticulously modifying and adjusting to make the ultimate snorkeling performance product.3 AVAILABLE SIZES FOR A PERFECT FIT.To determine your mask size simply measure from the bridge of your nose to the bottom of your chin.1.

</h2><div>
</div><h2>Numbers matter</h2><div>
</div><p>
</p><div>
</div><p>Thanks to
Easyride-r system, the possibility to reduce
delays in rescue operations allows us to state that
every year more than 9,000 people can be saved and about 30,000 injured ones can be rescued very quickly, thus avoiding much more severe
consequences than at present. To be rescued promptly is a fact that undoubtedly and
significantly reduces the risks of suffering permanent consequences.</p><h2>
Statistics prove us right</h2><div>
</div><div>
<p>Every year thousands of motorcyclists are
involved in accidents, owing to many factors. From recklessness to distraction and even to fatality,
all these causes
lead to a long list of instances that invariably end up being turned into
statistics. <br/>The world charts inevitably lead to highlight that the problem of two-wheels' accidents is an issue which needs
to be effectively dealt with. We, at Easyride-r, we have been busy with that for some years already.</p>

<h2><b>Risks and challenges</b></h2>
<p>In the last two years, Easyride-r performed functional tests through various ""lab kits"" of the product in the most extreme circumstances and has fixed some technical deficiencies.</p>
<p>One thing we can guarantee is that our system is composed of '80% from well-proven technologies already utilized in various fields. Our skilled engineers use these apparatuses every day and give us the tranquility of being able to exclude a priori that the product may present hurdles that can not be resolved.</p>
<p>As of today, we are ready to face the last challenge before landing on the market.</p>
<p>We are aware of the responsibility and the importance that the timing that we reported on our timeline are to be respected to satisfy our clients.</p>
<p>Just for this reason, three months before the product will be distributed, 50 prototypes will be given and tested by competent bodies, by test pilots who will submit them to stress testing in different parts of the world expressing their final evaluations.</p>
<p>Some general issues in the process of the completion of the product could emerge, making postpone our market entry.</p>
<p>We set ourselves right time with a certain margin of risk, calculating that it is a truly revolutionary and unique product in the world.</p>
<p>It is our commitment to keep all of you informed on the evolution and compliance with of our deadlines.</p>
<p>The technology, the preparation, the reliability of Swiss companies have always been synonymous for quality and trustworthiness around the world. Easyride-r wants to continue and enhance this concept.</p>

</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul><li>
<i style=""background-color: initial;"">Easyride-r</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  is
a device conceived in order to be the most complete and reliable safety system
available to anyone. You only need to install the main unit onto the motorbike
(you are done in 15 mins.), install the intercom kit on the helmet and the
system is ready for use. The system keeps monitoring - throughout the whole
duration of the journey - the motorbike-pilot-passenger conditions by means of
algorithms generated by the main unit, installed on the motorbike itself, and
exchanged with the intercom unit, fitted on the helmet. At the end of our
journey, </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Easyride-r  </i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">will activate the
anti-theft alarm modality that remains active until we wish to switch it off by means of
our remote control.<br/><br/></span>
</li></ul><div>
</div><p><b>Is a
subscription needed in order to use <i>Easyride-r</i>?</b></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul><li>At the time of purchase, <i style=""background-color: initial;"">Easyride-r</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  has a
pre-installed SIM Data Card. For the first year the subscription fee to the
service will be offered by the </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Easyride-r </i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Team</span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">. <br/></i><br/>At the
moment of the first year expiration it will be possible to renew the service
with our Team or - as an alternative - to make a deal with your own mobile
telephone operator.<br/><br/>
</li></ul><div>
</div><p><b>Can the system
be used on any kind of motorbike and on all helmets?</b></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul><li>The universal kit has no whatsoever limitation as far
as installation is concerned: it has been conceived to satisfy any kind of need
from city traffic to long distance riding. Any 2 wheels vehicle and any helmet
can accommodate our system in a very simple and quick way.<br/><br/>
</li></ul><div>
</div><p><b>Is installing
easy?</b></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul><li>The main unit which is to be fitted under the seat or
under the fuel tank is already equipped with the power supply cable to be
connected to the main supply of your vehicle. Only a few minutes are required
to accomplish this task. A similar procedure applies to installation of the
helmet unit. Simply follow the instructions supplied with the system and in a
few minuets the system is ready for immediate use.<br/><br/>
</li></ul><div>
</div><p><b><i>Easyride-r </i> would work
anywhere?</b></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul><li>Our product works exactly as a last generation
smartphone, but with some additional features and technologies that will
enhance its performances as far as communication and traceability is concerned.
Thanks to his internal management systems, <i style=""background-color: initial;"">Easyride-r</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  can rely upon 4 modalities of traceability simultaneously active and working,
even under the most harsh conditions. Unfortunately, in some areas of the
world, the signal coverage is somehow limited, but these are limitations which
necessarily affect any digital device present on the market at this time. Our
products have been repeatedly and extensively tested in order to evaluate their
performances even under very adverse conditions and the results we got were
absolutely unbelievable.<br/></span><br/>
</li></ul><div>
</div><p><b>Has the
product any maintenance costs?</b></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul><li>As with all services operating in the field of safety
and of territorial control, there are minimal management costs which must be
provided for in order to be able to guarantee the quality and the efficiency of
the service itself. We are referring to a dedicated and personalized call-center
for each one of you. This call-center, which is already operational at
international level in first-aid management, can intervene in case of an
emergency situation, dealing with sensible data of the pilot and, if present, of the passenger, all stored in a special data bank which is managed and
protected by servers on the Amazon’s platform.<br/><br/>The management
costs for such a service are in course of definition <span style=""background-color: initial;"">but to give a rough indication they will be
confined to the range of a few tens of dollars per year.<br/><br/></span>
</li></ul><div>
</div><p><b>In case of
emergency, who will answer the call?</b></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul><li>In case of emergency the system generates the first
telephone call aimed at the owner of the system through the intercom fitted on
the helmet. Should this call not receive an answer, <i style=""background-color: initial;"">Easyride-r</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  will generate a
second call this time aimed at the dedicated emergency call-center which will then
receive all data concerning the pilot/passenger involved. The sensible data are
then made available to the rescuers in force of the preventive agreement to the
use of such data by the owner.<br/></span><br/>
</li></ul><div>
</div><p><b>Who will be
sending the rescue team?</b></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul><li>The emergency call-center which manages the <i style=""background-color: initial;"">Easyride-r</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  service monitors the emergency conditions. Once that the
system will have triggered the first alarm, the operator will decide the type
of intervention and its modalities, will alert the rescuers and will forward
all the necessary data for the intervention such as the geographical location
and other sensible data on the owner of our device.<br/></span><br/>
</li></ul><div>
</div><p><b>If <i>Easyride-r</i>  breaks down, who will fix it?</b></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul><li>
<i>Easyride-r  </i>has a warranty covering the product for 24
months. In case of failure or break-down, you will only need to contact our
Customer Service and very swiftly each case will be specifically followed up
and any defective product replaced within the next 48 hours.<br/><br/>
</li></ul><div>
</div><p><span style=""background-color: initial;font-size: 16px;""><b>If the
motorbike switches off or there is a battery power supply failure, the system
will function all the same?</b></span></p><div>
</div><ul><li>
<i style=""background-color: initial;"">Easyride-r</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  is
equipped with a totally independent functioning system. Even under the most
extreme conditions the system will keep on managing the emergencies, even
without main power supply turned off, our device will carry on working and  transmitting data for the following 36 hours.<br/></span><br/>
</li></ul><div>
</div><p><b>What if the
helmet fell off one’s hands, or the bike fell off accidentally ? Is the alarm
going off?</b></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul><li>Thanks to the studies that we have carried out, we
have been able to develop a product that can avoid all false alarms. We have
created algorithms that put into communication the main unit fitted on the
motorbike with the device that is applied to the helmet. Unless all conditions
we have figured out in case of accident are present, the devices cannot
generate any accidental alarm. In order to avoid even more such an occurrence,
our system is equipped with cross checks that prevent any unjustified alarm to
be generated.<br/><br/>
</li></ul><div>
</div><p><b>Does the
system work only for the pilot, or else also the passenger is protected?</b></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul><li>
<i style=""background-color: initial;"">Easyride-r</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  has thought about your safe trip both for
yourself and for you passenger. There are 2 versions of the kit: a single one
and a second one with a double device pilot/passenger which is able to manage
and monitor both. And even in case the single kit has been purchased, the
second device can then be integrated at a later time by purchasing it
separately.<br/></span><br/>
</li></ul><div>
</div><p><b>Why should I
purchase <i>Easyride-r </i>?</b></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul><li>The first answer which comes up spontaneously is:
because it is the only system which can save your life under certain
circumstances in case of accident. Nobody will ever wish to be able to use it,
but to be able to rely upon a safety system that recognizes and autonomously
manage a dangerous event, is always a very good reason to consider it as the
best “travel companion”. Moreover, <i style=""background-color: initial;"">Easyride-r</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  wraps up all main primary functions in just one product only. You will not need
to purchase any other device in order to have also an intercom and a anti-theft
alarm system. Another very good reason is the one that insurance companies
offer substantial discounts to owners and users of traceability systems and
satellite anti-theft systems. </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Easyride-r </i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
is all this and even far beyond.</span><br/>

<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>I numeri sono importanti</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Grazie al sistema Easyride-r, la possibilità di
ridurre i tempi nei soccorsi ci permette di poter affermare che ogni anno si
possono salvare più di 9.000 persone e circa 30.000 feriti possono essere
soccorsi in tempi molto rapidi, evitando conseguenze ben più gravi rispetto ad
ora. Essere soccorsi con tempestività, riduce in modo evidente e significativo
il rischio di subire conseguenze permanenti.</p>
<h2><b>Le statistiche ci danno ragione</b></h2>
<p>Ogni anno migliaia di motociclisti sono vittime di
incidenti, questo dovuto a numerosi fattori. Dall'imprudenza, alla distrazione e fino alla fatalità, sono tutte cause che portano a formare una lunga lista di casi che,
immancabilmente finiscono per essere trasformati in statistiche.<br/>I grafici
mondiali portano inevitabilmente ad evidenziare che il problema degli
incidenti sulle 2 ruote è un problema da affrontare seriamente. Noi di
Easyride-r lo stiamo facendo da alcuni anni.</p>

<h2><b>Sfide e rischi</b></h2>
<p>In questi ultimi 2 anni,
Easyride-r ha testato il funzionamento attraverso diversi “lab kit” del
prodotto in tutte le situazioni più estreme e ha corretto alcune lacune di
carattere tecnico.</p>
<p>La cosa che possiamo garantire
è che il nostro sistema è composto dall’ 80% da tecnologie ben collaudate e
utilizzate in vari settori. I nostri tecnici qualificati utilizzano questi
apparati quotidianamente e ci danno la tranquillità di poter escludere a priori
che il prodotto possa presentare ostacoli non risolvibili.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ad
oggi, ci prepariamo ad affrontare l’ultima sfida prima di approdare sul
mercato.</p>
<p>Siamo
consapevoli della responsabilità e dell’importanza che i tempi che abbiamo
riportato sul nostro Time line siano da rispettare per soddisfare i nostri
clienti.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Proprio per questo motivo, 3
mesi prima che il prodotto venga distribuito, 50 prototipi verranno consegnati
e collaudati da enti preposti, da piloti collaudatori che li sottoporranno a
stress test in varie parti del mondo esprimendo le loro valutazioni finali.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Alcune
problematiche generali in corso di ultimazione del prodotto potrebbero
emergere, facendo posticipare il nostro ingresso sul mercato.</p>
<p>Ci
siamo dati tempi giusti con un certo margine di rischio, calcolando che si
tratta di un prodotto davvero rivoluzionario ed unico al mondo.</p>
<p>Sarà
nostro impegno tenere informati tutti voi sull’evolversi e sul rispetto delle
nostre scadenze.</p>
Precisione, tecnologia e serietà delle imprese
svizzere, sono da sempre sinonimo di qualità, affidabilità e durata di prodotti
in tutto il mondo. Easyride-r vuol continuare ad onorare quest’immagine.</div>

<p><b><i>Grazie<br/></i></b><b style=""background-color: initial;""><i>Il vostro Easyride-r Team</i></b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Come funziona <i>Easyride-r</i>?</b></p>
<ul><li>
<i>Easyride-r</i>  è un dispositivo ideato per
essere il più completo ed affidabile sistema di sicurezza a disposizione di
tutti. Basta collegare la centralina alla moto (bastano 15 minuti), installare
il kit interfono sul casco ed il sistema è pronto per essere utilizzato. Il
sistema monitora per tutta la durata del viaggio, le condizioni moto/pilota/passeggero
attraverso algoritmi generati tra la centralina posta sulla moto e l’unità
interfono montata sul casco. Al termine del nostro viaggio, <i>Easyride-r  </i>attiverà la modalità
antifurto che resterà in funzione fino al momento in cui la si voglia
disinserire attraverso gli appositi telecomandi. </li></ul>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Per utilizzare <b><i>Easyride-r</i></b>  bisogna fare un abbonamento?</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>Al
momento dell’acquisto, <i>Easyride-r </i> ha
già installato la SIM card dati. Per il primo anno, la quota abbonamento al
servizio, sarà offerta dal Team di <i>Easyride-r. <br/></i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Allo scadere del primo anno, è possibile rinnovare il
servizio con il nostro Team oppure prendere accordi con il proprio operatore
telefonico.</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span></p></span></span></li></ul>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Il sistema si può utilizzare
su tutte le moto e tutti i caschi?</b><br/></p>
<ul><li>Il
kit universale non ha limitazioni di installazione, è stato ideato per
soddisfare ogni tipo di esigenza, dallo scooter per girare in città, alle moto
da gran turismo per i lunghi viaggi. Ogni veicolo a due ruote ed ogni casco,
possono installare in modo semplice e veloce il nostro sistema.</li></ul>
<p><b>Il montaggio è semplice?</b></p>
<ul><li>La centralina da collocare
sotto la sella o sotto il serbatoio è già dotata di cavo di collegamento alla
rete primaria di alimentazione del veicolo. Bastano pochi minuti per eseguire
questa operazione. Stessa cosa per installare il dispositivo sul casco, basta
seguire le istruzioni allegate ed in pochi minuti il sistema è pronto per
essere utilizzato.</li></ul>
<p><b><b><i>Easyride-r</i></b>  funziona ovunque?</b></p>
<ul><li>Il
nostro prodotto funziona esattamente come uno smartphone di ultima generazione,
con l’aggiunta di alcuni accorgimenti e tecnologie che aumentano le prestazioni
di comunicabilità e rintracciabilità. Grazie ai suoi sistemi interni di
gestione, <i style=""background-color: initial;"">Easyride-r </i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> può contare su 4
modalità di rintracciabilità che funzionano simultaneamente, anche nelle
condizioni più ostili. Purtroppo, in alcune aree del mondo, la copertura del
segnale presenta alcuni limiti, ma questo è una limitazione che riguarda
qualsiasi sistema attualmente sul mercato. Sul nostro prodotto sono stati fatti
numerosi test per valutare le prestazioni anche in situazioni molto avverse ed
i risultati conseguiti sono stati sbalorditivi.</span>
</li></ul>
<br/><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Il prodotto ha costi di manutenzione?</b>
</div>
<div><b style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></b></div>
<div>
<ul><li>Come
tutti i servizi che operano nel campo della sicurezza e sorveglianza dei
territori, ci sono dei costi minimi di gestione da sostenere per poter
garantire la qualità e l’efficienza del servizi stesso. Stiamo parlando di un
call center dedicato e personalizzato per ognuno di voi. Questo call center,
che già opera a livello internazionale nella gestione di primo soccorso, è in
grado di intervenire nelle situazioni d’emergenza, nella gestione di dati
sensibili del pilota ed eventuale passeggero inseriti in una speciale banca
dati gestita e protetta dai server sulla piattaforma di Amazon.<br/>I costi di gestione del servizio sono in corso di
definizione ma si attesteranno in ambiti di poche decine di dollari all’anno.</li></ul>
<p><b>Nel caso di emergenza chi
risponde alla chiamata?</b></p>
<ul><li>In
caso di emergenza, il sistema genera la prima chiamata indirizzata al pilota attraverso l’interfono nel casco. Se a questa chiamata non si
dovesse rispondere, <i style=""background-color: initial;"">Easyride-r </i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
inoltra una seconda chiamata al call center dedicato, il quale riceve tutti i
dati del pilota/passeggero coinvolti. I dati sensibili vengono messi a disposizione
dei soccorritori attraverso l’autorizzazione preventiva all’uso di tali dati.</span>
</li></ul>
<p><b>Da chi vengono inviati i
soccorsi?</b></p>
<ul><li>Il
call center che gestisce il servizio <i style=""background-color: initial;"">Easyride-r </i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> monitora le condizioni di emergenza. Una volta che il sistema genera il primo allarme,
l’operatore decide il tipo di intervento e la modalità, allerta i soccorsi ed
invia tutti i dati necessari per l’intervento, località ed informazioni
sensibili sul possessore del nostro dispositivo.</span>
</li></ul>
<p><b>Se <i>Easyride-r  </i>si guasta, chi lo ripara?</b></p>
<ul><li>
<i>Easyride-r </i> ha una garanzia che copre il
prodotto per 24 mesi. In caso di guasto o malfunzionamento, basta contattarci
tramite mail al nostro servizio clienti ed in tempi rapidi verrà seguito ogni
caso nello specifico e sostituito il prodotto nelle 48 ore successive.</li></ul>
<p><span><b>Se la moto si spegne o viene a
mancare l’alimentazione dalla batteria, il sistema funziona lo stesso?</b></span></p>
<ul><li>
<i>Easyride-r </i> è dotato di un sistema
completamente autonomo di funzionamento. Anche nelle condizioni più estreme, il
sistema continua a gestire le emergenze, anche nel caso in cui ci dovesse
essere il completo distacco dell’alimentazione primaria dell’impianto, il
nostro dispositivo può continuare ad inviare dati per le 36 ore successive.</li></ul>
<p><b>Se cade il casco dalle mani, o
cade la moto accidentalmente, il sistema va in allarme?</b></p>
<ul><li>Grazie agli studi condotti,
abbiamo realizzato un prodotto in grado di evitare falsi allarmi. Abbiamo
creato algoritmi che mettono in comunicazione tra loro la centralina della moto
ed il dispositivo sul casco. Se non ci sono tutte le condizioni che abbiamo
ipotizzato in caso di incidente, i dispositivi non generano nessun tipo di
allarme accidentale. Per scongiurare ancora di più che ciò non avvenga, il
nostro sistema è dotato di controlli incrociati che impediscono di generare allarmi
ingiustificati.</li></ul>
<p><b>Il sistema funziona solo per
il pilota? Oppure anche il passeggero è protetto?</b></p>
<ul><li>
<i>Easyride-r </i> <span>ha pensato al vostro viaggio
sicuro sia per voi che per il vostro passeggero, esistono 2 versioni del kit,
una singola ed una con doppio dispositivo pilota/passeggero in grado di gestire
e monitorare entrambi. Anche nel caso venga acquistato il kit singolo, il
secondo dispositivo può essere integrato successivamente acquistandolo
separatamente.</span>
</li></ul>
<p><b>Perché dovrei acquistare <i>Easyride-r</i> ?</b></p>
<ul><li>La prima risposta che ci
sentiamo di dare è: perché è l’unico sistema in grado di salvarvi la vita in
determinate condizioni in caso di incidente. Nessuno si augura di doverlo mai
utilizzare ma poter contare su un sistema di sicurezza in grado di riconoscere,
gestire autonomamente una situazione di pericolo, è sempre un motivo valido per
considerarlo come un ottimo “compagno di viaggio”. Inoltre, <i>Easyride-r</i>  racchiude tutte le principali
funzioni primarie in un solo prodotto, non sarà necessario acquistare altri
dispositivi per poter avere anche un interfono ed un impianto antifurto. Un
altro valido motivo è quello che le compagnie assicurative offrono sconti
consistenti se si è in possesso di sistemi di rintracciabilità, antifurti
satellitari, <i>Easyride-r</i> è tutto questo
ed anche oltre.</li></ul>
<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>La sicurezza per Easyride-r</h2>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Dal momento che il nostro
progetto ha iniziato a diventare realtà, il Team di Easyride-r ha deciso di ideare
una campagna di sensibilizzazione per diffondere l'importanza di dotarsi di
sistemi di sicurezza in ogni viaggio affrontato sulle 2 ruote. Dal più breve al
più lungo di essi, ogni volta che saliamo sulla nostra moto, sappiamo che
l'imprevisto potrebbe essere dietro l'angolo. Easyride-r ha deciso di fare
prevenzione ed ha fatto la scelta di salvare vite.</span><br/></p>
<p>I nostri operatori partecipano
a conferenze, dibattiti, interviste, conducono campagne direttamente a contatto
con il nostro ""mondo"", Noi siamo tutti coinvolti in prima persona, ed
ogni giorno, il nostro gruppo diventa sempre più numeroso.</p>

How is Easyride-r made?


How does Easyride-r work?
(The device mock-up presented here on the helmet is for functionality demonstration only)












Safe and reliable
Thanks to our last years of researches, we have highlighted all potential weaknesses and we have neutralized them. We focused on developing a product that could guarantee upward performances under whatsoever condition. Easyride-r  fully honors the expectations, the Swiss way.










Numbers matter


Thanks to
Easyride-r system, the possibility to reduce
delays in rescue operations allows us to state that
every year more than 9,000 people can be saved and about 30,000 injured ones can be rescued very quickly, thus avoiding much more severe
consequences than at present. To be rescued promptly is a fact that undoubtedly and
significantly reduces the risks of suffering permanent consequences.
Statistics prove us right

Every year thousands of motorcyclists are
involved in accidents, owing to many factors. From recklessness to distraction and even to fatality,
all these causes
lead to a long list of instances that invariably end up being turned into
statistics. The world charts inevitably lead to highlight that the problem of two-wheels' accidents is an issue which needs
to be effectively dealt with. We, at Easyride-r, we have been busy with that for some years already.

Thank you, your Easyride-r Team




How does Easyride-r work?


Easyride-r  is
a device conceived in order to be the most complete and reliable safety system
available to anyone. You only need to install the main unit onto the motorbike
(you are done in 15 mins.), install the intercom kit on the helmet and the
system is ready for use. The system keeps monitoring - throughout the whole
duration of the journey - the motorbike-pilot-passenger conditions by means of
algorithms generated by the main unit, installed on the motorbike itself, and
exchanged with the intercom unit, fitted on the helmet. At the end of our
journey, Easyride-r  will activate the
anti-theft alarm modality that remains active until we wish to switch it off by means of
our remote control.

Is a
subscription needed in order to use Easyride-r?

At the time of purchase, Easyride-r  has a
pre-installed SIM Data Card. For the first year the subscription fee to the
service will be offered by the Easyride-r Team. At the
moment of the first year expiration it will be possible to renew the service
with our Team or - as an alternative - to make a deal with your own mobile
telephone operator.

Can the system
be used on any kind of motorbike and on all helmets?

The universal kit has no whatsoever limitation as far
as installation is concerned: it has been conceived to satisfy any kind of need
from city traffic to long distance riding. Any 2 wheels vehicle and any helmet
can accommodate our system in a very simple and quick way.

Is installing
easy?

The main unit which is to be fitted under the seat or
under the fuel tank is already equipped with the power supply cable to be
connected to the main supply of your vehicle. Only a few minutes are required
to accomplish this task. A similar procedure applies to installation of the
helmet unit. Simply follow the instructions supplied with the system and in a
few minuets the system is ready for immediate use.

Easyride-r  would work
anywhere?

Our product works exactly as a last generation
smartphone, but with some additional features and technologies that will
enhance its performances as far as communication and traceability is concerned.
Thanks to his internal management systems, Easyride-r  can rely upon 4 modalities of traceability simultaneously active and working,
even under the most harsh conditions. Unfortunately, in some areas of the
world, the signal coverage is somehow limited, but these are limitations which
necessarily affect any digital device present on the market at this time. Our
products have been repeatedly and extensively tested in order to evaluate their
performances even under very adverse conditions and the results we got were
absolutely unbelievable.

Has the
product any maintenance costs?

As with all services operating in the field of safety
and of territorial control, there are minimal management costs which must be
provided for in order to be able to guarantee the quality and the efficiency of
the service itself. We are referring to a dedicated and personalized call-center
for each one of you. This call-center, which is already operational at
international level in first-aid management, can intervene in case of an
emergency situation, dealing with sensible data of the pilot and, if present, of the passenger, all stored in a special data bank which is managed and
protected by servers on the Amazon’s platform.The management
costs for such a service are in course of definition but to give a rough indication they will be
confined to the range of a few tens of dollars per year.

In case of
emergency, who will answer the call?

In case of emergency the system generates the first
telephone call aimed at the owner of the system through the intercom fitted on
the helmet. Should this call not receive an answer, Easyride-r  will generate a
second call this time aimed at the dedicated emergency call-center which will then
receive all data concerning the pilot/passenger involved. The sensible data are
then made available to the rescuers in force of the preventive agreement to the
use of such data by the owner.

Who will be
sending the rescue team?

The emergency call-center which manages the Easyride-r  service monitors the emergency conditions. Once that the
system will have triggered the first alarm, the operator will decide the type
of intervention and its modalities, will alert the rescuers and will forward
all the necessary data for the intervention such as the geographical location
and other sensible data on the owner of our device.

If Easyride-r  breaks down, who will fix it?


Easyride-r  has a warranty covering the product for 24
months. In case of failure or break-down, you will only need to contact our
Customer Service and very swiftly each case will be specifically followed up
and any defective product replaced within the next 48 hours.

If the
motorbike switches off or there is a battery power supply failure, the system
will function all the same?

Easyride-r  is
equipped with a totally independent functioning system. Even under the most
extreme conditions the system will keep on managing the emergencies, even
without main power supply turned off, our device will carry on working and  transmitting data for the following 36 hours.

What if the
helmet fell off one’s hands, or the bike fell off accidentally ? Is the alarm
going off?

Thanks to the studies that we have carried out, we
have been able to develop a product that can avoid all false alarms. We have
created algorithms that put into communication the main unit fitted on the
motorbike with the device that is applied to the helmet. Unless all conditions
we have figured out in case of accident are present, the devices cannot
generate any accidental alarm. In order to avoid even more such an occurrence,
our system is equipped with cross checks that prevent any unjustified alarm to
be generated.

Does the
system work only for the pilot, or else also the passenger is protected?


Easyride-r  has thought about your safe trip both for
yourself and for you passenger. There are 2 versions of the kit: a single one
and a second one with a double device pilot/passenger which is able to manage
and monitor both. And even in case the single kit has been purchased, the
second device can then be integrated at a later time by purchasing it
separately.

Why should I
purchase Easyride-r ?

The first answer which comes up spontaneously is:
because it is the only system which can save your life under certain
circumstances in case of accident. Nobody will ever wish to be able to use it,
but to be able to rely upon a safety system that recognizes and autonomously
manage a dangerous event, is always a very good reason to consider it as the
best “travel companion”. Moreover, Easyride-r  wraps up all main primary functions in just one product only. You will not need
to purchase any other device in order to have also an intercom and a anti-theft
alarm system. Another very good reason is the one that insurance companies
offer substantial discounts to owners and users of traceability systems and
satellite anti-theft systems. Easyride-r 
is all this and even far beyond.

Safety to Easyride-rSince our project became a reality, the Easyride-r Team has decided to conceive a public awareness campaign to spread the importance of having security systems in every journey faced on two wheels. It doesn’t matter if it is a short or a long ride. Every time we get on our bikes, we know that the unexpected might hide just around the corner. Easyride-r decided to ward off and has made the choice to help saving lives.Our teammates attend conferences, debates, interviews, they lead campaigns being in direct contact with our ""world"". We are all personally involved, and day in, day out, our group grows larger.From mountains to citiesThe importance of spreading and raising awareness about road safety, urges us to be present at all the most prominent and meaningful events. Our goal? Reach out to as many people as possible. Every day, every hour, every minute, every second means precious time and means saved lives.

Come funziona Easyride-r?(Il modello del dispositivo presentato qui sul casco serve solamente per dimostrare la funzionalità)













Sicuro e affidabile

Grazie alla ricerca fatta in
questi anni, abbiamo focalizzato tutti i possibili punti deboli da eliminare.
Ci siamo concentrati a realizzare un prodotto che potesse garantire le massime
prestazioni in qualsiasi condizione. Easyride-r  soddisfa in pieno le
aspettative, alla precisione svizzera.




I numeri sono importanti

Grazie al sistema Easyride-r, la possibilità di
ridurre i tempi nei soccorsi ci permette di poter affermare che ogni anno si
possono salvare più di 9.000 persone e circa 30.000 feriti possono essere
soccorsi in tempi molto rapidi, evitando conseguenze ben più gravi rispetto ad
ora. Essere soccorsi con tempestività, riduce in modo evidente e significativo
il rischio di subire conseguenze permanenti.
Le statistiche ci danno ragione
Ogni anno migliaia di motociclisti sono vittime di
incidenti, questo dovuto a numerosi fattori. Dall'imprudenza, alla distrazione e fino alla fatalità, sono tutte cause che portano a formare una lunga lista di casi che,
immancabilmente finiscono per essere trasformati in statistiche.I grafici
mondiali portano inevitabilmente ad evidenziare che il problema degli
incidenti sulle 2 ruote è un problema da affrontare seriamente. Noi di
Easyride-r lo stiamo facendo da alcuni anni.

GrazieIl vostro Easyride-r Team

Come funziona Easyride-r?

Easyride-r  è un dispositivo ideato per
essere il più completo ed affidabile sistema di sicurezza a disposizione di
tutti. Basta collegare la centralina alla moto (bastano 15 minuti), installare
il kit interfono sul casco ed il sistema è pronto per essere utilizzato. Il
sistema monitora per tutta la durata del viaggio, le condizioni moto/pilota/passeggero
attraverso algoritmi generati tra la centralina posta sulla moto e l’unità
interfono montata sul casco. Al termine del nostro viaggio, Easyride-r  attiverà la modalità
antifurto che resterà in funzione fino al momento in cui la si voglia
disinserire attraverso gli appositi telecomandi. 
Per utilizzare Easyride-r  bisogna fare un abbonamento?

Al
momento dell’acquisto, Easyride-r  ha
già installato la SIM card dati. Per il primo anno, la quota abbonamento al
servizio, sarà offerta dal Team di Easyride-r. Allo scadere del primo anno, è possibile rinnovare il
servizio con il nostro Team oppure prendere accordi con il proprio operatore
telefonico. 
Il sistema si può utilizzare
su tutte le moto e tutti i caschi?
Il
kit universale non ha limitazioni di installazione, è stato ideato per
soddisfare ogni tipo di esigenza, dallo scooter per girare in città, alle moto
da gran turismo per i lunghi viaggi. Ogni veicolo a due ruote ed ogni casco,
possono installare in modo semplice e veloce il nostro sistema.
Il montaggio è semplice?
La centralina da collocare
sotto la sella o sotto il serbatoio è già dotata di cavo di collegamento alla
rete primaria di alimentazione del veicolo. Bastano pochi minuti per eseguire
questa operazione. Stessa cosa per installare il dispositivo sul casco, basta
seguire le istruzioni allegate ed in pochi minuti il sistema è pronto per
essere utilizzato.
Easyride-r  funziona ovunque?
Il
nostro prodotto funziona esattamente come uno smartphone di ultima generazione,
con l’aggiunta di alcuni accorgimenti e tecnologie che aumentano le prestazioni
di comunicabilità e rintracciabilità. Grazie ai suoi sistemi interni di
gestione, Easyride-r  può contare su 4
modalità di rintracciabilità che funzionano simultaneamente, anche nelle
condizioni più ostili. Purtroppo, in alcune aree del mondo, la copertura del
segnale presenta alcuni limiti, ma questo è una limitazione che riguarda
qualsiasi sistema attualmente sul mercato. Sul nostro prodotto sono stati fatti
numerosi test per valutare le prestazioni anche in situazioni molto avverse ed
i risultati conseguiti sono stati sbalorditivi.

Il prodotto ha costi di manutenzione?



Come
tutti i servizi che operano nel campo della sicurezza e sorveglianza dei
territori, ci sono dei costi minimi di gestione da sostenere per poter
garantire la qualità e l’efficienza del servizi stesso. Stiamo parlando di un
call center dedicato e personalizzato per ognuno di voi. Questo call center,
che già opera a livello internazionale nella gestione di primo soccorso, è in
grado di intervenire nelle situazioni d’emergenza, nella gestione di dati
sensibili del pilota ed eventuale passeggero inseriti in una speciale banca
dati gestita e protetta dai server sulla piattaforma di Amazon.I costi di gestione del servizio sono in corso di
definizione ma si attesteranno in ambiti di poche decine di dollari all’anno.
Nel caso di emergenza chi
risponde alla chiamata?
In
caso di emergenza, il sistema genera la prima chiamata indirizzata al pilota attraverso l’interfono nel casco. Se a questa chiamata non si
dovesse rispondere, Easyride-r 
inoltra una seconda chiamata al call center dedicato, il quale riceve tutti i
dati del pilota/passeggero coinvolti. I dati sensibili vengono messi a disposizione
dei soccorritori attraverso l’autorizzazione preventiva all’uso di tali dati.

Da chi vengono inviati i
soccorsi?
Il
call center che gestisce il servizio Easyride-r  monitora le condizioni di emergenza. Una volta che il sistema genera il primo allarme,
l’operatore decide il tipo di intervento e la modalità, allerta i soccorsi ed
invia tutti i dati necessari per l’intervento, località ed informazioni
sensibili sul possessore del nostro dispositivo.

Se Easyride-r  si guasta, chi lo ripara?

Easyride-r  ha una garanzia che copre il
prodotto per 24 mesi. In caso di guasto o malfunzionamento, basta contattarci
tramite mail al nostro servizio clienti ed in tempi rapidi verrà seguito ogni
caso nello specifico e sostituito il prodotto nelle 48 ore successive.
Se la moto si spegne o viene a
mancare l’alimentazione dalla batteria, il sistema funziona lo stesso?

Easyride-r  è dotato di un sistema
completamente autonomo di funzionamento. Anche nelle condizioni più estreme, il
sistema continua a gestire le emergenze, anche nel caso in cui ci dovesse
essere il completo distacco dell’alimentazione primaria dell’impianto, il
nostro dispositivo può continuare ad inviare dati per le 36 ore successive.
Se cade il casco dalle mani, o
cade la moto accidentalmente, il sistema va in allarme?
Grazie agli studi condotti,
abbiamo realizzato un prodotto in grado di evitare falsi allarmi. Abbiamo
creato algoritmi che mettono in comunicazione tra loro la centralina della moto
ed il dispositivo sul casco. Se non ci sono tutte le condizioni che abbiamo
ipotizzato in caso di incidente, i dispositivi non generano nessun tipo di
allarme accidentale. Per scongiurare ancora di più che ciò non avvenga, il
nostro sistema è dotato di controlli incrociati che impediscono di generare allarmi
ingiustificati.
Il sistema funziona solo per
il pilota? Oppure anche il passeggero è protetto?

Easyride-r  ha pensato al vostro viaggio
sicuro sia per voi che per il vostro passeggero, esistono 2 versioni del kit,
una singola ed una con doppio dispositivo pilota/passeggero in grado di gestire
e monitorare entrambi. Anche nel caso venga acquistato il kit singolo, il
secondo dispositivo può essere integrato successivamente acquistandolo
separatamente.

Perché dovrei acquistare Easyride-r ?
La prima risposta che ci
sentiamo di dare è: perché è l’unico sistema in grado di salvarvi la vita in
determinate condizioni in caso di incidente. Nessuno si augura di doverlo mai
utilizzare ma poter contare su un sistema di sicurezza in grado di riconoscere,
gestire autonomamente una situazione di pericolo, è sempre un motivo valido per
considerarlo come un ottimo “compagno di viaggio”. Inoltre, Easyride-r  racchiude tutte le principali
funzioni primarie in un solo prodotto, non sarà necessario acquistare altri
dispositivi per poter avere anche un interfono ed un impianto antifurto. Un
altro valido motivo è quello che le compagnie assicurative offrono sconti
consistenti se si è in possesso di sistemi di rintracciabilità, antifurti
satellitari, Easyride-r è tutto questo
ed anche oltre.

La sicurezza per Easyride-r
Dal momento che il nostro
progetto ha iniziato a diventare realtà, il Team di Easyride-r ha deciso di ideare
una campagna di sensibilizzazione per diffondere l'importanza di dotarsi di
sistemi di sicurezza in ogni viaggio affrontato sulle 2 ruote. Dal più breve al
più lungo di essi, ogni volta che saliamo sulla nostra moto, sappiamo che
l'imprevisto potrebbe essere dietro l'angolo. Easyride-r ha deciso di fare
prevenzione ed ha fatto la scelta di salvare vite.
I nostri operatori partecipano
a conferenze, dibattiti, interviste, conducono campagne direttamente a contatto
con il nostro ""mondo"", Noi siamo tutti coinvolti in prima persona, ed
ogni giorno, il nostro gruppo diventa sempre più numeroso.





Dalle montagne alle città
L'importanza di diffondere e
sensibilizzare sulla sicurezza, ci spinge ad essere presenti in tutte le
manifestazioni più importanti e significative. Il nostro obiettivo? Raggiungere
più persone possibile. Ogni giorno, ogni ora, ogni minuto, ogni secondo, è
tempo prezioso e sono vite salvate.

Combining an almost endless span of azure blue, crystal clear water…1,000 feet of spectacular palm-fringed, white-sanded beach…and the excitement and luxury that are the hallmark of the management company's world-renowned hotels, Princesa de Roatan Resort and Spa will offer guests like you a truly matchless experience.</p><p>The resort is being built on the unspoiled north shore of the eastern end of the island of Roatan. The first phase of construction consists of approximately 302 fully furnished suites…and will eventually rise to no more than three floors.

l'Isère (2,2 km),
puis j'attache                      Isere (2.2 km), I then lockle vélo sur la rive et je traverse en                                the bike up at the river bankkayak (1 km). Une fois sur l'autre

Essais réalisés avec un Brompton prêté par Cyclable Grenoble.

Le vélo est bien sanglé, le poids bien réparti, pas de roulis, je peux naviguer sans soucis.
A terme le vélo sera dans une housse étanche, pour le protéger des éclaboussures et assurer sa flottaison au cas où.

                                        ! NEW ! NOUVEAU ! NUEVO !             La deuxième vidéo de la chaîne Youtube 'aller au boulot en kayak' faite par des élèves de l'école de journalisme de Grenoble, avec le nouveau vélo Brompton.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGDLhJDG58c

Le nouveau kayak de 2,90 m au lieu de 4,50 m pour l'ancien



le même sur l'eau (tout est plus compact)


Comparatif ancien système et nouveau



 le Tempo + VTT mesurait 6,50 m alors que le Chicago + Brompton ne font que 4,60 m de long.



C'est bien simple le nouvel attelage fait la même longueur que le Tempo seul.


Les prénoms sur le kayak pour tous les contributeurs de 25 € et plus, comme prévus dans les contreparties. Cf vidéo privée sur Youtube :

In just 5 minutes, the powerful compressor is able to reduce the outlet air temperature by 20°F/11°C.       Inside Zero Breeze Mark II, we have integrated a revolutionary dual hose system to draw in fresh outdoor air and output the hot exhaust air through a separate hose. Dual Hose allows an intake hose to be used to circulate fresh air inside so that there is no negative pressure in the room also this structure will provide a greater unit performance efficiency and maximized output cooling power.  Zero Breeze Mark II provides a stream of smooth, uninterrupted, high-velocity air, for personal cooling. improved from the last generation, Zero Breeze Mark II uses a newly upgraded duct system which utilizes a centrifugal fan to ensure the air volume. The air volume is increased by 53% from 100 cfm to 153 cfm. Also, Brushless DC motor generates powerful airflow, while using less energy and reduce the noise level to less than 40 dba in sleep mode.                               The patented noise cancellation technology allows Zero Breeze Mark Ⅱ to work at 40-50 dba which is perfect for tent and small space use. There are four working modes including sleep mode and dehumidification mode. With Zero Breeze Mark Ⅱ, you can stay cool and remain undisturbed in your sleep.

<p> We are the Canadian Men's Elite Team underwater hockey team. We put in long hours of training and considerable sums of money to compete in a completely unfunded sport. Underwater hockey is a game that is played on the bottom of a swimming pool, using a mask, snorkel, fins, glove and a short stick.  Push and/or pass a 3 lb coated lead puck along the bottom, trying to get to your opponents goal. The only thing stopping you: six opponents and that pesky little requirement for oxygen!</p>
<p>It is now played in dozens of countries throughout the world. World championships are held every 2 years.</p>
<p>Because it is played in water at the bottom of a pool, it is a 3 dimensional game: your opponent can come from any direction, including above you! Breathhold ability, finesse, puck-handling, passing, speed and teamwork are imortant skills. The puck is passed by rolling it off the edge of the stick and flicking it forward.</p>
<p>We need to raise funds to meet our goal of competing in the Quebec City Tournament.</p>

<p><b>About Extreme Fliers</b></p>
<p>We are a small group of inventors, engineers and of course, drone enthusiasts. </p>
<p>Micro Drone 3.0 is a great product but also it is a platform that continuously evolves with a pipeline of ideas to create new functionality through modules, be that serious stuff like a smart module for monitoring air quality, night vision camera or fun modules such as a nerf gun shooter, we have the engineering experience and know how to develop new and exciting modules which snap on to the Drone. This is just the beginning and we can’t wait to see what you all comes up with!</p>
<p><b>Why Crowdfunding</b></p>
<p>What started as a personal passion, Micro Drone has evolved into a product that has developed so much from it's users. With Micro Drone 3.0 finally here, the exciting thing about the coming months and years is building on the platform and furthering the technology. We can't wait to see what we accomplish together. Since Vernon first demonstrated Micro Drone 2.0 at Techcrunch Disrupt NY in 2013, we realised that building great technology is within our collective reach. We have the ability to hire top engineers for product development all over the world, so we also want to share our plans and allow users to be part of the process. You get to be involved with other users who believe in us and share our vision. You have really inspired us and we have learnt so much about advanced technologies, from rotor theory, electronics and industrial design. We micro-sized it and applied this to Micro Drone 3.0 to create highly desirable sophisticated features. We then tweaked and perfected the concepts, building countless prototypes to make it consumer friendly and bringing together the best ideas to create the next model. <br/><br/>We want you to be the first to get your hands on Micro Drone 3.0 and we want you to share your feedback and comments. With your help, we will be able to finalise tooling to go into production.</p>
<p> </p> <a name=""FAQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><h3><b>FAQs</b></h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Q: How do I pay the $20, $30, or $50 flat rate shipping fee? </b></p>
<p>A: For a single order please add $20 for shipping when you pledge. For the multiple orders please add their corresponding shipping amounts. For those who have not added the shipping fee, no additional action is required at this stage, we will reach out to everyone near to delivery time to finalise the shipping and reconfirm delivery addresses.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is the professional 2.4Ghz Remote Control included in the single order perk level? </b></p>
<p>A: Yes, the controller is included in the package.</p>
<p><b>Q: If Micro Gimbal stretch goal is reached, how do I get one and how much will it cost? </b></p>
<p>A: We need to reach $250k to start production of the Micro Gimbal (so far we have already smashed through the $200k mark in just 2 days). It will retail for around $99 however we will be offering special pricing to our backers when it goes on sale so you will be able to pick one up for around $50.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the flight time for Micro Drone 3.0? How long does it take to recharge the battery?</b></p>
<p>A: We won’t speculate or exaggerate the potential flying time of the final production unit so here is what we are currently achieving: without the camera module attached we are able to get up to 8 minutes continuous flying, with the accessories the flight is around 6 minutes and when we use the Expansion Pack and Camera we are able to achieve 7 minutes (because of the additional lifting power). This is what our current actual working prototypes are achieving and this should improve in our production models. From our experience we were able to understand the limitations of battery technology and have designed super user friendly removable batteries that seamlessly swap out without having to connect any wires. The recharge time will be up to an hour, extra batteries will also be available (and affordable). At TechCrunch Disrupt we met an MIT research group who have discovered an incredible way to rapidly charge lithium batteries which is exciting. A USB recharging dock is included in the package.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is there a video of Micro Drone 3.0 flying? </b></p>
<p>A: Yes, to be open and transparent we have been demonstrating Micro Drone at all our events since CES 2015 to show how it flies. Everyone who saw us was amazed by the level of stability and maneuverability we have achieved, from the Throw to Launch, Smart Orientation, ability to fly in a straight line, in windy conditions and circular banking. We are putting it out there to show the impressive things it can do, as well what it can’t do and sharing our vision of the things we are working on for the future! Search “Micro Drone 3.0” on Youtube where there are videos posted by people who came to see it (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp2cm4hAg04&amp;t=29s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> is a demo at CES). We will also be sharing videos which talk about how we created these features in detail as the campaign progresses.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does Micro Drone 3.0 only stream video or can it also record?</b></p>
<p>A: Micro Drone 3.0 can both stream video to a smartphone/tablet as well as record onto an onboard Micro SD memory card.</p>
<p><b>Q: How loud is Micro Drone 3.0 in flight? </b></p>
<p>A: We are using high grade endurance motors which are the quietest available (the same coreless motors used for vibrating smartphones). Feedback from Micro Drone 2.0 has been that users really liked how quiet they were (this model was not much louder than a whisper in flight), Micro Drone 3.0 has bigger motors which are a bit louder. We will produce a video to give you an example.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is it possible to acquire additional batteries to be shipped with Micro Drone 3.0? </b></p>
<p>A: We will be creating an additional perk for batteries you can pick up prior to shipping. Additional batteries will be available for $15 a piece.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does Micro Drone 3.0 fly autonomously and have a ‘follow me’ feature? </b></p>
<p>A: We are working on this and find it very interesting but outside of the lab such technology is still a long way off. In 2013 we built prototypes that used sonar and IR sensors to attempt to fly autonomously which we demonstrated <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k9LmU-c8Mk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, however this didn’t add much more stability due to the many variables using it in the real world. We have focused on making the Drone more Automatic choosing sensors which work reliably and make controlling the Drone easier. We think future autonomous flying will be achieved using vector based computer vision and LADAR where the device knows what an object is. Having smashed our second funding goal, with your support we will be able to make a great level of further development into this.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can the camera module take photos? What is the resolution of the HD camera module?  </b></p>
<p>A: The camera module can take both photos and video. The photo resolution is 1280 x 720 pixels and image file size for each photo is typically between 30KB and 100KB. The video is shot in 720p (1280 x 720 pixels) and its recording rate is approximately 100MB/s.</p>
<p><b>Q: What formats are the video and photos?</b></p>
<p>A: The video records as AVI format with an MJPG codec and a frame rate of 30fps with a 1280 x 720 pixel resolution and 14.6 Mbps bitrate. There is also a Microphone and the audio codec is PCM with 128Kbps bitrate and CBR bitrate mode. The photos it takes are JPEG format with a 1280 x 720 pixel resolution and lossy compression mode.</p>
<p><b>Q: How will Micro Drone link video with my smartphone/tablet?</b></p>
<p>A: Micro Drone 3.0 becomes a WiFi access point that your smartphone/tablet tethers to over a secure connection. Once this connection is established our app will be able to automatically configure and display the video stream coming from the drone to your smartphone/tablet.</p>
<p><b>Q: Will there be a carrying case for Micro Drone 3.0 available for purchase at some point?</b></p>
<p>A: We have had a lot of requests for this and we will reach out to backers to see if this is something we should make! My initial thoughts is making a beautiful, glossy, white, hard case, with the ability to attach to your belt. Please let us know your feedback: email v@extremefliers.co.uk</p>
<p><b>Q: Will there be replacement blades available? If so how much will they be?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes, there will be spare blades available, their price will be announced closer to our production date. We will offer parts at an affordable price, for example spare blades for Micro Drone 2.0 are only $1.99 and delivered world wide.</p>
<p><b>Q: Where do you ship to and will I need to pay import duty?</b></p>
<p>A: We will be shipping Drones directly to backers from Hong Kong to all countries. Backers will need to pay any customs charges on arrival according to your local country's rates.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the range on Micro Drone 3.0? </b></p>
<p>A: With its dual control, Micro Drone 3.0 can be flown using either our professional 2.4 GHz remote control or a smartphone/tablet over WiFi. With the 2.4 GHz Remote Control the range is 300ft (~91m). The camera module will be able to record video to an onboard Micro SD memory card up to this distance. Live streaming to your smartphone/tablet can be made up to 50ft.</p>
<p><b>Q: What happens when the battery runs low on Micro Drone 3.0?</b></p>
<p>A: We have designed an early warning indicator where the onboard LEDs flash rapidly when there is less than 30 seconds of remaining flight time.</p>
<p><b>Q: Are the protective bumpers shipping with Micro Drone 3.0?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes, we are including these in the set.</p>
<p><b>Q: Will it be possible eventually to have a 1080p resolution camera for Micro Drone 3.0?</b></p> A: Yes! We designed modules to snap on with magnets which means we will be able to offer a wide selection of cameras (Fish Eye Lens, 1080p, Night Vision and more). Camera technology is getting lighter, more advanced and we will be able to continuously upgrade the modules without having to change the Drone.</div>

<p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p>
<p>Having worked on Micro Drone since 2011 and successfully produced two models, we have complete confidence in the delivery of this product. Combining all the experience, feedback and tacit knowledge and working alongside industry veterans, we have focused on the small things that matter, checking off each step in meticulous detail. We have touched every part of the process from the industrial design (from the way magnets seamlessly attach the modules) to securing reliable production partners who can build Micro Drone at scale. Taken together we believe we will be able to not just deliver the best small size Drone to date, but one which is also user friendly.</p>
<p>Having seen other crowd funding campaigns, we understand the issues hardware makers face. Micro Drone 3.0 has undergone extensive testing and we have a working product which will be ready to start production after the campaign has finished. We have provided a conservative shipping date of November and we will update backers as this progresses. Our key component suppliers (PCB production, Battery production and Injection moulding) can typically work within a 3-4 month turnaround and we have a great relationship working directly with each supplier who have scheduled production time for Micro Drone 3.0 to fulfill initial demand from Indiegogo.</p>
<p>We are excited that Micro Drone 3.0 is finally at the stage where we can offer it to users who share our vision. We want to build a community of users and one of the challenges is to build an ecosystem that rewards and incentivises our users. Once the first units of Micro Drone 3.0 are in the hands of our backers, we will be making a sustained ongoing effort to work with developers to create new modules and come up the best things for a small personal drone - this is a super important initiative for us. To do this we're going to build a pool of talent, provide design mentorship and give developers calls to action with special events. We will also provide ways for developers to get real rewards for developing third party modules. So, if you are an independent maker you will become a really important part of what we are doing and if you are a user, you will have a Drone that continuously evolves with new, exciting and compelling ways to use it.</p>

About Extreme Fliers
We are a small group of inventors, engineers and of course, drone enthusiasts. 
Micro Drone 3.0 is a great product but also it is a platform that continuously evolves with a pipeline of ideas to create new functionality through modules, be that serious stuff like a smart module for monitoring air quality, night vision camera or fun modules such as a nerf gun shooter, we have the engineering experience and know how to develop new and exciting modules which snap on to the Drone. This is just the beginning and we can’t wait to see what you all comes up with!
Why Crowdfunding
What started as a personal passion, Micro Drone has evolved into a product that has developed so much from it's users. With Micro Drone 3.0 finally here, the exciting thing about the coming months and years is building on the platform and furthering the technology. We can't wait to see what we accomplish together. Since Vernon first demonstrated Micro Drone 2.0 at Techcrunch Disrupt NY in 2013, we realised that building great technology is within our collective reach. We have the ability to hire top engineers for product development all over the world, so we also want to share our plans and allow users to be part of the process. You get to be involved with other users who believe in us and share our vision. You have really inspired us and we have learnt so much about advanced technologies, from rotor theory, electronics and industrial design. We micro-sized it and applied this to Micro Drone 3.0 to create highly desirable sophisticated features. We then tweaked and perfected the concepts, building countless prototypes to make it consumer friendly and bringing together the best ideas to create the next model. We want you to be the first to get your hands on Micro Drone 3.0 and we want you to share your feedback and comments. With your help, we will be able to finalise tooling to go into production.
  FAQs
 
 
Q: How do I pay the $20, $30, or $50 flat rate shipping fee? 
A: For a single order please add $20 for shipping when you pledge. For the multiple orders please add their corresponding shipping amounts. For those who have not added the shipping fee, no additional action is required at this stage, we will reach out to everyone near to delivery time to finalise the shipping and reconfirm delivery addresses.
Q: Is the professional 2.4Ghz Remote Control included in the single order perk level? 
A: Yes, the controller is included in the package.
Q: If Micro Gimbal stretch goal is reached, how do I get one and how much will it cost? 
A: We need to reach $250k to start production of the Micro Gimbal (so far we have already smashed through the $200k mark in just 2 days). It will retail for around $99 however we will be offering special pricing to our backers when it goes on sale so you will be able to pick one up for around $50.
Q: What is the flight time for Micro Drone 3.0? How long does it take to recharge the battery?
A: We won’t speculate or exaggerate the potential flying time of the final production unit so here is what we are currently achieving: without the camera module attached we are able to get up to 8 minutes continuous flying, with the accessories the flight is around 6 minutes and when we use the Expansion Pack and Camera we are able to achieve 7 minutes (because of the additional lifting power). This is what our current actual working prototypes are achieving and this should improve in our production models. From our experience we were able to understand the limitations of battery technology and have designed super user friendly removable batteries that seamlessly swap out without having to connect any wires. The recharge time will be up to an hour, extra batteries will also be available (and affordable). At TechCrunch Disrupt we met an MIT research group who have discovered an incredible way to rapidly charge lithium batteries which is exciting. A USB recharging dock is included in the package.
Q: Is there a video of Micro Drone 3.0 flying? 
A: Yes, to be open and transparent we have been demonstrating Micro Drone at all our events since CES 2015 to show how it flies. Everyone who saw us was amazed by the level of stability and maneuverability we have achieved, from the Throw to Launch, Smart Orientation, ability to fly in a straight line, in windy conditions and circular banking. We are putting it out there to show the impressive things it can do, as well what it can’t do and sharing our vision of the things we are working on for the future! Search “Micro Drone 3.0” on Youtube where there are videos posted by people who came to see it (here is a demo at CES). We will also be sharing videos which talk about how we created these features in detail as the campaign progresses.
Q: Does Micro Drone 3.0 only stream video or can it also record?
A: Micro Drone 3.0 can both stream video to a smartphone/tablet as well as record onto an onboard Micro SD memory card.
Q: How loud is Micro Drone 3.0 in flight? 
A: We are using high grade endurance motors which are the quietest available (the same coreless motors used for vibrating smartphones). Feedback from Micro Drone 2.0 has been that users really liked how quiet they were (this model was not much louder than a whisper in flight), Micro Drone 3.0 has bigger motors which are a bit louder. We will produce a video to give you an example.
Q: Is it possible to acquire additional batteries to be shipped with Micro Drone 3.0? 
A: We will be creating an additional perk for batteries you can pick up prior to shipping. Additional batteries will be available for $15 a piece.
Q: Does Micro Drone 3.0 fly autonomously and have a ‘follow me’ feature? 
A: We are working on this and find it very interesting but outside of the lab such technology is still a long way off.
