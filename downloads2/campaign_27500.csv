The Founder & His Inspiration...
The Gentlemen's Retreat is a life-long dream of Kenneth Chabert, an Bronx native who chose to leave the city for the pursuit of a different life. Chabert's Martin Luther King Jr. scholarship brought him to Providence College, where he was afforded opportunities to pursue a degree in Business and Leadership. While in college, he owned two barber shops in NYC and pursued an entrepreneurial venture with a clothing line. In 2010, Kenneth’s personal story of life-changing events entitled, “Squeeze,” was aired on Rhode Island Public Radio’s This I Believe.More recently, Kenneth was chosen as “A Brave One” by Leadercast, the largest leadership conference in the world.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>We fundamentally believe that to make the world better, we need a diverse and qualified group of people, contributing their unique perspective and communities needs at the solutions table. As a foundation, we believe that every community is interconnected, which means the challenges of one impacts all. Thus, interacting in diverse groups gives us an opportunity to come together, understand needs, share gifts, solve problems, experience struggles and create bonds that allow communities to persevere during times of crisis.</span></p>The SourceCode B46 Foundation was created to serve underrepresented communities by providing their children with educational opportunities that lead to them earning a seat at the nation's solutions tables. As a result, the funds raised from this campaign will help us fulfill 8 scholarships. These scholarships will allow elementary students to access summer educational opportunities with zero barriers. <p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Our Journey</h3>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The SourceCode B46 Foundation was created in early 2015 by the founders of SourceCode B46, LLC (SCB46). Our journey started in 2012 with the creation of a volunteer program called the Fern Creek Coding Project. The goal of the program was to introduce 14 students from an underserved elementary school to the world of software coding.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Over the next 2 years, our volunteer program experienced tremendous growth. To maintain sustainability, we transitioned the program to <a href=""www.sourcecodeb46.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>SourceCode B46, LLC</a> (SCB46) in 2014. Today, SCB46 provides a core skills development program that builds potential in elementary students through storytelling and software coding. Our services are used by Orange County Public Schools, the Orlando Science Center, the District of Columbia Department of Parks &amp; Recreation Dept. and in homes across the state of Florida.</span><br/></p>

<h3></h3>
<h3><span>Still On Mission</span></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SCB46 is growing, but we are still a small, self-funded and bootstrapped startup. Although earning revenue to sustain our growth is essential, the quest for it never blinds or distracts us from our mission to ensure every child, regardless of financial, physical or social limitations, has access to our services. As a result, we established the SourceCode B46 Foundation (501(c)3) as our philanthropic arm and a way for community partners and donors to walk with us on our mission.</p>

<h3>Putting Your Gift To Work</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During this fundraising campaign, we would like to raise $6,200. These funds will allow 8 elementary students to access quality programming this summer by eliminating financial and technical barriers. Each scholarship is valued at $775 and includes:</p>

<ul><li>
<b>A Brand New Laptop Computer with Webcam.</b> The laptop will allow students to access online sessions and their team.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>2 Months of High-Speed Internet Access. </b></li></ul>

</div></div>","Stepping Into The Need
 
“To make the world stronger and more beautiful by ensuring every community has a qualified representative at the solutions table.""


We fundamentally believe that to make the world better, we need a diverse and qualified group of people, contributing their unique perspective and communities needs at the solutions table. As a foundation, we believe that every community is interconnected, which means the challenges of one impacts all. Thus, interacting in diverse groups gives us an opportunity to come together, understand needs, share gifts, solve problems, experience struggles and create bonds that allow communities to persevere during times of crisis.The SourceCode B46 Foundation was created to serve underrepresented communities by providing their children with educational opportunities that lead to them earning a seat at the nation's solutions tables. As a result, the funds raised from this campaign will help us fulfill 8 scholarships. These scholarships will allow elementary students to access summer educational opportunities with zero barriers.    Our Journey


The SourceCode B46 Foundation was created in early 2015 by the founders of SourceCode B46, LLC (SCB46). Our journey started in 2012 with the creation of a volunteer program called the Fern Creek Coding Project. The goal of the program was to introduce 14 students from an underserved elementary school to the world of software coding.


Over the next 2 years, our volunteer program experienced tremendous growth. To maintain sustainability, we transitioned the program to SourceCode B46, LLC (SCB46) in 2014. Today, SCB46 provides a core skills development program that builds potential in elementary students through storytelling and software coding. Our services are used by Orange County Public Schools, the Orlando Science Center, the District of Columbia Department of Parks & Recreation Dept. and in homes across the state of Florida.



Still On Mission
SCB46 is growing, but we are still a small, self-funded and bootstrapped startup. Although earning revenue to sustain our growth is essential, the quest for it never blinds or distracts us from our mission to ensure every child, regardless of financial, physical or social limitations, has access to our services. As a result, we established the SourceCode B46 Foundation (501(c)3) as our philanthropic arm and a way for community partners and donors to walk with us on our mission.



Putting Your Gift To Work
During this fundraising campaign, we would like to raise $6,200. These funds will allow 8 elementary students to access quality programming this summer by eliminating financial and technical barriers. Each scholarship is valued at $775 and includes:

Full Tuition to the SourceCode B46 Online Summer Program. During the 8-week program (6/22 - 8/14), a team of six students and an instructor will work online to turn an idea into a story and then transform it into an animated movie by coding.

A Brand New Laptop Computer with Webcam. The laptop will allow students to access online sessions and their team.
2 Months of High-Speed Internet Access. 
Any overages will be used to fund additional student scholarships. In the event that we do not meet our funding goals, student scholarships will still be awarded.


The Perks
All funders will receive a digital copy of scholarship student movies, a ""I Made A Movie With Code"" bracelet and the following perks:

$25: A SourceCode B46 thank you card.


$75: Closing credit listing in a scholarship student movie and thank you card.


$150: Closing credit listing in all scholarship student movies and thank you card.

$500: Peanut Butter & Jelly Award and closing credit listing in all scholarship student movies.
$1000: Peanut Butter & Jelly Award, closing credit producer listing and one SCB46 online program fully-paid and transferable voucher.





The Bigger Impact Since 2014, SCB46 has reached over 800 students and continues to grow. Our work and unique method of building potential in elementary kids through storytelling and software coding resonates with learning guardians. As a result, our clients, such as Orange County Public Schools, the Orlando Science Center and the District of Columbia Department of Parks & Recreation Dept., trust us.

The  project-based learning curriculum that we deploy provides students with 8-weeks of rigorous instructions. Additionally, students learn co-working skills and enhance their potential in the following ways:

Build High-Level Thinking - The process of coding requires students to learn computational thinking skills, which are required to break down their stories and sequence them into an animated movie.

Comprehension of Academic Concepts - During the program, students are exposed to key State standard-aligned academic concepts in English language arts, math, history and science. These concepts are reinforced throughout the program, specifically during visualization exercises, such as storyboarding and movie creation.
Increase Confidence - Coding is highly rigorous and requires students to learn how to manage stress and overcome obstacles. Our program intentionally introduces points of failure into the process followed by opportunities to reassess and move forward.
Early Exposure - If students become interested in storyboarding, creative writing, film or software coding, early exposure helps them begin the accumulation of the 10,000 hours required to become proficient (Gladwell, Malcolm (2008). Outliers. Little, Brown and Company), thus making them more competitive when entering the workforce.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i><u>Let's Bring Back the Gold Standard!</u></i></h2>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<div>
<p>Nonprofit Funds a 501c3 public charity promotes financial awareness of the difference
between asset banking and fractional banking systems.  Our goal is to create educational awareness
of how the worlds banking system works. 
We will help design and teach people how to better handle their
financial circumstances and create a safer financial environment for their
future.</p>
<p>Nonprofit Funds will work individually with persons in need
to help them better understand their financial capabilities, awareness and
provide educational assistance in helping them to become aware of their own budgetary
needs and how to accomplish those goals. 
Our initial target are individuals residing in Texas and California but
our goal is to expand the program to reach individuals around the world.</p>
<p>We will educate people about asset-backed banking including
the formation of 501c14 credit unions. 
The organization will provide education on the differences between banks
and credit unions, how to fiscally handle funds in a responsible manner, how to
differentiate between fractional banking and asset banking, etc.  Our intention is to educate individuals on
ways to increase their purchasing power and earning power.</p>
<p>In addition, the organization will teach individuals about
the various financial aspects of banking including budgeting, fiscally handling
budgets, financial sustainability, and better handling of their money situation.  Our goal is to bring in individuals with banking
backgrounds and an accountant to become part of the instructional classes.  To provide the education, the organization
will set up internet classes; go to different facilities to meet, greet, and
teach.</p>
<p>We will also provide support to educate and help individuals
form their own 501c14 organizations and garner enough people to form the
organization.  For instance, in the state
of California it takes 500 people to form a credit union so we will teach
individuals how to attain this number of individuals.  Nonprofit Funds will not supply monies to
form 501c14 organizations.  We will
conduct this education through our online school located at <a href=""http://nonprofitfunds.nonprofitbank.org/education/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://nonprofitfunds.nonprofitbank.org/education/</a></p>

Mission Statement

Nonprofit Funds a 501c3 public charity promotes financial awareness of the difference
between asset banking and fractional banking systems.  Our goal is to create educational awareness
of how the worlds banking system works. 
We will help design and teach people how to better handle their
financial circumstances and create a safer financial environment for their
future.
Nonprofit Funds will work individually with persons in need
to help them better understand their financial capabilities, awareness and
provide educational assistance in helping them to become aware of their own budgetary
needs and how to accomplish those goals. 
Our initial target are individuals residing in Texas and California but
our goal is to expand the program to reach individuals around the world.
We will educate people about asset-backed banking including
the formation of 501c14 credit unions. 
The organization will provide education on the differences between banks
and credit unions, how to fiscally handle funds in a responsible manner, how to
differentiate between fractional banking and asset banking, etc.  Our intention is to educate individuals on
ways to increase their purchasing power and earning power.
In addition, the organization will teach individuals about
the various financial aspects of banking including budgeting, fiscally handling
budgets, financial sustainability, and better handling of their money situation.  Our goal is to bring in individuals with banking
backgrounds and an accountant to become part of the instructional classes.  To provide the education, the organization
will set up internet classes; go to different facilities to meet, greet, and
teach.
We will also provide support to educate and help individuals
form their own 501c14 organizations and garner enough people to form the
organization.  For instance, in the state
of California it takes 500 people to form a credit union so we will teach
individuals how to attain this number of individuals.  Nonprofit Funds will not supply monies to
form 501c14 organizations.  We will
conduct this education through our online school located at http://nonprofitfunds.nonprofitbank.org/education/
_____________________________________________________________________________

The Problem we Face






 Governments keep printing unbacked money. Then the bankers get their hands on it and create even more unbacked capital by using fractional banking.  If the governments and financial institutions of the world won't fix the fractional banking and quantitative easing problems then the people will! 








The Solution





All future customers of NonprofitBank.org will have their money backed with gold or silver; Your purchasing power will be the amount of  gold or silver you have in your account which will be sold at the live rate when you use your debit card.





What we are Doing to Revolutionize Banking





NonprofitBank.org is being built by the people and owned by the people through the nonprofit charity Nonprofit Funds 501c3 used to educate and organize co-op groups of people then help them form asset backed credit unions.

Their network of young promotores and youth peer providers “health promotores” not only do sexual and reproductive health education but even distribute some birth control methods like condoms, the pill, and a monthly birth control shot.

They talk about all of it. They receive anonymous questions via text, fb, and even by phone.

Risks and Challenges    There are many partnerships that are being developed to ensure an authentic experience for our first experiential learning simulation, The African Village.  We are developing agreements with local farmers to assist in animal maintenance, as well as agreements with African foundations for native staff and volunteers. We are reaching out to youth, college, and adult groups from all over the Ohio region to attend the camp.  We may face challenges throughout these partnerships, but with your help, we can change the way people invest in the world around them.  We are connected to many faith based organizations, non-profit organizations, and for profit businesses all over the city who are excited to see this project come to fruition. Our plan is to continue cultivating and developing our key relationships, offer significant ownership in our venture to those who play a key role in launching, and to always give credit to our Heavenly Father for everything we do.

WHO IS THIS FOR?
 

Remember those dreams you had when you were a kid? As children we played many imaginative games. We became explorers, astronauts, emulated our favorite sports champions, movie stars and storybook idols.  What do you dream?

 
Do you want the best for your family? Do you aspire to become a community leader and role model? Do you dream of dong what you want when you want? Do you have a secret wish to accomplish? Do you live the fantasies you could only dream of?

If you thing that:


""it will never work for me"" (You never developed a game plan to succeed.)
""it will take too much time"" (You’re too busy answering other peoples’ orders.)
""this is too difficult, I don’t have the discipline to carry it out? (You don’t need the discipline! That’s where we come in!)""
""it would take a lot of work? (It requires no more effort than it takes to complete a popular magazine’s personality test!) 
""I am too busy to take advantage of it"" (It takes no more time than going to the movie theatre or a sporting event once a year!) 
""it would cost too much? (You’re probably already paying for it!)
well... We don't just want you to back the campaign though, we want you to join our community and be a part of making history.


It's for people like you, that is not achieving goals in life and that is living someone else dream. It's for people like you who truly believe that your dream is possible and necessary and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve it.
The most famous behavioral scientists have discovered people’s aversion to loss usually trumps the potential for reward. The joy of accomplishment motivates you towards achieving your Dream but powerful demotivators keep you stuck. 
Give it a Try

WHY DO YOU NEED IT?   We all know that people like you need a tool to help you accomplish your DREAM and something to motivate you to take action every single day, because NO MATTER HOW BAD IT IS OR HOW BAD IT GETS YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE IT.We all know that having directions in life is crucial, so with this agenda you can get what you want in life. You need to set some goals, deadline and plan to achieve them with this agenda because YOU CAN IMAGINE AND LIVE YOUR DREAM.
 HOW DOES IT WORK?In order to appreciate how the ""Imagine Your Dream"" agenda works, it's important you understand the dynamic of goal settings, planning and positive affirmation. Achieving your goals depends on how hard you are working to improve.The easiest thing in your life is to achieve one of your goals and the most difficult thing is to believe that it can happen to you. 
In this agenda you write your name, your goals and plan to achieve them. Everyday for 365 days you will read them loud and write why you are successful and grateful in life. If you believe it you can see it. 
In this campaign you help yourself and millions of people to achieve personal and economic goals in life. On top, you help the members of Mondosol to develop this program and the startup company reaching even more people internationally.  
And when it comes to creating a book with me as an author, how is that done? Once you have picked one of the perk available to create your own agenda you will work together with the happy staff of Mondosol to get your book done. And you can have your front and back cover personalized, your name as an author on the cover and in the acknowledgements. If you want, you can also have a personal dedication and praise adding some pictures inside.   
Does everyone get the same book with very minor changes besides the author's name? Of course not, this book is created to be a personal agenda or diary so we can personalize all the outside and part of the inside of the book as you like. Also you need to write your personal manifesto and plan to achieve your dream. And you will read them during your 365 days program where you are going to take notes on your successes and reasons to be grateful in life. Look further down and the perks on the right side for more details and clarity.

""1 000 000 euros to pay for:

Book to production (600 000 euros at least for 100 000 units) Each copy of the book sold, finances the writing, designing and printing.
Fill the orders (up to 40 000 packaging and shipping) Every copy sold of the paper book version is sent to your address or to your favourite Homeless Center/Charity/School/Library.
Cover the cost of the other perks, royalties and customization (150 000 euros) This will create a remarkable educational foundation available to everyone and one that can grow and evolve long past the conclusion of the campaign. 
Press and publicity (up to 10 000 euros) The success of this book depend on your contribution that will help to create a word of mouth to be successful, including infrastructure, events, development resources, and more. 
10% donation to charities and referrals (up to 200 000 euros) We want to ensure the book created for Homeless Center/Charity/School/Library gets as much testing as possible with more kids in more towns and villages.

 
 If anything left will be spent:

on a Website and Mobile App (estimated cost 5000 euros) Your contribution will be an investment in open education, as well as ensuring that the technology can live and grow when the project concludes.
in the book translation in other languages (around 1000 euros per language) We are growing a global community to solve the grand challenges of our time. Your contribution will help create this community - come and join us!

RISK & CHALLENGES
Let us be very transparent and open. Here are the risks and obstacles we may face on the way to achieving our goal. We have tried to minimize all possible risks before launching the campaign, but we are aware that unanticipated issues can arise. Regardless, we'll always be 100% transparent with you. 
Shipping date - Production time can vary depending on the volume of the print run, but we've left room for error in case our estimates are not accurate.
Product changes - The look of the book (binding, cover design, etc) will likely change throughout its development, especially after considering your feedback. But it will always be for the better :)
Working with external partners - Since we'll be coordinating with various partners to fulfill book orders, we ask for your understanding if unexpected challenges arise that affect our ability to respond as quickly as we would like to all your requests.

<p>I've been working on a program to help improve the reading and listening skills of students who are learning foreign languages. The first group of several thousand students will consist of children in Thai orphanages, Burmese migrant workers in Bangkok and Burmese refugees in refugee camps along the Thai/Burmese border. Within a year, my goal is to provide these students and hundreds of thousands of others around the world in similar situations with an educational platform that helps them learn a foreign language and broadens the opportunities that are open to them.</p>

<br/><p>When I was teaching English to kids in the south of Thailand, I found it difficult to get them interested in reading English language stories. Because I enjoy creating stories almost as much as reading them, I decided to write some English stories for my students. To get them really involved in the stories, I used a format that put them into the story as the main character who had to make decisions that would lead to different outcomes. This proved to be a great way to get the kids more interested in reading. When they finished one arc of the story, they'd go back and find out what would have happened if they had made different decisions.</p> </div> <div> <h3>How It Has Evolved</h3> <p></p>
<p>The original idea was only to write stories that would make learning English a more enjoyable experience for Thai students. Then I looked back at my time spent trying to learn Spanish while living in Argentina. I had trouble finding reading materials that would help me learn Spanish, while also maintaining my interest.  Because of that experience, <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I thought it would be a good idea to make a reading program that could help people who are trying to learn foreign languages.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I came up with a format to write stories that were translated into multiple languages and allowed a speaker of any one of those languages to easily read stories in any of the other languages.

<h3>Online Classes</h3>
<p>I plan to develop online classes to be used along with the reading program.

 Purchase the program for use in the school, non-profit learning center or library of your choice. For just $100, every student in your child's school could use the program to help them learn a foreign language. If two people purchase the program for the same school, I'll let the school know that you both bought the program for the school and you can each choose one more school that gets to use the program.
Tell others about the project. Let them know about it by sharing a link to this campaign.

If you're interested in getting directly involved in the project, contact me because I could really use your help.

</h1><h1>The National
Center for Accessible Media at WGBH is seeking funding to begin development of CADET, caption
authoring software which will enable anyone to easily and affordably produce
high-quality caption files that are compatible with any media player on any web
browser. </h1>
<p>The majority
of online videos are self-generated, with original content that is not
accessible to millions of people who are deaf or hard of hearing because the
videos are not captioned. Automated speech-to-text captioning does not provide
reliable access. Federal regulations and related litigation will continue to
dramatically increase the number of online videos that are required to be
captioned, with high-quality captions. This is especially true of online
education/ MOOCs. Currently there is no simple, inexpensive caption-editing
software for creating post-production online captions. </p>
<p>NCAM’s
solution is to create and distribute a <b>FREE</b>, high-quality, easy-to-use caption
editor that will produce caption files that are compatible with all popular web
browsers, online media players, and can be readily uploaded to social media
sites. NCAM will build on the original success of its now out-of-date
caption-editing tool, MAGpie (Media Access Generator), whose thousands of users
proved that a simple and affordable tool can increase the number of captioned
videos online. <br/></p><p></p><p><b>NCAM is
seeking contributions toward its goal of $50,000 to fund the beta version of CADET, the
Caption And Description Editing Tool, in 2016. </b></p>
<p>CADET will implement much of the
functionality available only in high-end caption authoring workstations, such
as WYSIWYG placement, timing assistance, multiple export formats covering the
most used timed-text file types, keyboard shortcuts, and other such features.
Unlike other captioning tools creators, NCAM has a unique insight into the
needs of caption writers, due to WGBH’s long history in creating captions and
developing captioning tools.  Since captioning requires human input, care
was taken to make the process as easy as possible. For example, keyboard
shortcuts enable a caption writer to save keystrokes and work without a mouse.
CADET will have a specific visual layout that makes transcription and editing
much easier. And, depending on the skill of the caption writer, CADET will make
it possible for each of the four steps of captioning (transcription, editing,
timing, and review) to be done separately (novice) or simultaneously (expert).
Other captioning software is not optimized in these ways.</p>
<p>Our
experience with MAGpie demonstrated that a free, high-quality tool will find
widespread adoption by individuals or institutions, especially in education and
government. Many video producers in education and in
government are required to caption their videos, and many more commercial Web
sites could begin captioning soon, due to the Department of Justice’s ongoing
efforts to communicate the importance of Web accessibility as part of the Americans
with Disabilities Act. The range of institutions in need of quality
captioning software is evident from the number of requests NCAM receives for
information about updates to MAGpie. <br/></p>
<p>Additionally,
it has been proven that captions are beneficial in literacy training and
reading comprehension. Captions are helpful for non-native speakers, in
situations where the volume cannot be turned on, and as a <b>powerful tool for search</b>. Providing a free, high-quality caption
editor will make it easy for all content creators, from education to
entertainment, to provide captions on all of their online videos. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b><span>Aren’t you just updating existing software?</span></b></p>
<p>While we are
taking the lessons learned from, and expertise behind, various NCAM development

<p>We are seeking only to fund the actual costs of the senior staff time (internal/external developers and UI/UX

the WGBH Educational Foundation, NCAM is a wholly self-supported unit; we cover
all related costs, such as office space/computer hardware and software/overhead
&amp; admin, etc.<span>  Once built, we’ll then
offer CADET to everyone for free.  </span></p>
<p>We are at the
forefront of standards research and policy requirements and, combined with our
caption creation and caption tech development expertise, we are uniquely
qualified to build a free tool that will help users to create high-quality

ready sharing to social media sites.  </p>
<p><b>You talk about captions, but can CADET

<p><b>Will CADET be released as Open Source?</b></p>
<p>In a word, <i>maybe</i>. NCAM is a wholly self-supported unit, funded
by a combination of research and consulting.  Because this project is so
important to us (and, in our opinion, to the world), we want to move forward
and build the tool.  <span>Because of what we do, we

not (in this scope) have funds to support the tool into the future unless we
seek additional funds.  It is the same situation we found ourselves

<p>— Scenario
One is that we don’t release the code, and that we allow users to support one
another via a listserv (in which NCAM participates as possible).  This was
the MAGpie model, and does not require a consequential investment of staff
dollars or time to manage post-launch.</p>
<p>— Scenario
Two is that we release the code, making it open source.  However, that

the story is your child meeting different characters based on his/her name and
then discovering how to spell their name. So the story and the characters that
your child meets is unique to his/her name and also in the end, their name is

As a school teacher, my wife Lauren has always tried to help her students know that each of them have the power to make a difference in the world. Each year, their class name is The Heroes. Apart from decorating the walls with superheroes, she teaches them to ""be a hero"" for someone else in need through service. We have decided to name our campaign #BeAHero, because you too can be a hero to the children in Southern Mexico. 
This last year, her school’s 3rd graders put on a talent show to raise money to help build a school in Chiapas, Mexico. When we went down to Chiapas this summer to see the schools we helped fund, we were deeply touched. The children and community leaders were so gracious and thankful. We want to rally your support to eliminate poverty, empower children, and eradicate the school shortage one school at a time. 

2. Your Donations
Every dollar you donate, up to $10,000, will be matched by a private committed US donor. The money you donate will help us build two High Schools in Reforma and a classroom in Benemerito de las Casas that we wouldn't be able to build without your help! 
The Chiapas government is very grateful for Escalera's efforts. Recently, Escalera finished building 31 classrooms, and they have partnered with the government to build 29 more. They need our help to make that happen. Every dollar you give will be matched with THREE DOLLARS from the Chiapas government. 

This means that if we are successful, the $10,000 we raise will be matched to make $20,000 from a US donor, which will multiply to $80,000 USD with the matching from the Chiapas government. Based on the 2014 average income in Chiapas of $225 pesos per day (~$13.50 USD), this would take 10 people working full-time for about 2.5 YEARS to earn! 


3. Our Story


My wife and I just moved back to my hometown, Austin, TX, after I graduated from BYU just a couple of months ago. We have almost been married for about a year, and we are expecting a baby girl this December! My wife is a schoolteacher and I am a real estate developer; we are both fluent in Spanish and equally passionate about eliminating poverty and creating opportunity through education. 



Five years ago, I lived in Mexico for two years. I spent all my time helping people in their families, communities, and local church congregations. When I left I returned to Brigham Young University to study finance and real estate. I had resolved to give back to the people in Mexico, but I didn’t know where to start. 



As soon as my wife, Lauren, and I found Escalera Foundation, we knew it was a great opportunity to be able to get involved and help raise enough money to make a difference in these kids’ lives.


Chiapas is the poorest state in Mexico, which makes Chiapas is the perfect place to start building schools. Their are numerous small villages that I have even lived in without access to any schools and...WE CAN CHANGE THAT. 


We know that education is the means by which the economy can grow, families can be stronger and communities can be successful.

</div><p></p><h4>“Passion is lifted from the earth itself by the muddy hands of the young; it travels along grass-stained sleeves to the heart. If we are going to save environmentalism and the environment, we must also save an endangered indicator species: the child in nature.” </h4><p>Richard Louv, <i>Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder</i></p><h3>OUR MISSION<br/><div>Langley Forest School is dedicated to fostering self-discovery and environmental awareness by allowing children to reconnect with nature through play and place-based, holistic learning experiences. <p></p>
</div>
</h3><p>Our mission is to reconnect children with our ever changing environment, while creating a base of knowledge surrounding the importance of community and sustainability. Our village-minded school meets a child's needs for self-esteem and leadership skills, in addition to meeting a community need for alternative early learning options.</p><h3><b>OUR CORE VALUES</b></h3><p><i>Play-based learning</i><br/>We believe that children should be allowed to develop at their own pace and to the fullest of their ability.​ We believe that by having choice in play, they learn and grow in their own unique way.​ </p><p><i>Environmental Sustainability</i><br/>We believe that it is our responsibility to care for and protect our environment. We believe that this desire to preserve our natural spaces begins by developing our innate curiosities and nurturing our bodies by spending as much time outside as possible. </p><p><i>Parent Involvement</i><br/>We believe that parent involvement in preschool fosters a child’s sense of self-worth and security, and strengthens parenting skills. We value the importance of family and community in our children’s development. </p><p><i>Community Involvement</i><br/>We believe in the importance of family and active participation in the community. </p><h3>WHY FOREST SCHOOL?<br/>
</h3><p>We believe that today's children are spending less time outside and more time indoors engaged in technology-driven activities. </p><p><b><i>We believe that as parents and educators, it is our responsibility to steer our children away from this ""nature-deficit-disorder"" (LOUV, 2005).</i></b></p>Since launching our forest school pilot program in September 2014, enrolment has more than doubled and interest in our school continues to grow. Now, in our second year, we have opened the forest to our first Kindergarten class. <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1274716/files/20150306162252-tumblr_inline_ndxkzdFqNV1t0in8i.jpg?1425687772"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>

If we are going to save environmentalism and the environment, we must also save an endangered indicator species: the child in nature.” Richard Louv, Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit DisorderOUR MISSIONLangley Forest School is dedicated to fostering self-discovery and environmental awareness by allowing children to reconnect with nature through play and place-based, holistic learning experiences. 

Our mission is to reconnect children with our ever changing environment, while creating a base of knowledge surrounding the importance of community and sustainability. Our village-minded school meets a child's needs for self-esteem and leadership skills, in addition to meeting a community need for alternative early learning options.OUR CORE VALUESPlay-based learningWe believe that children should be allowed to develop at their own pace and to the fullest of their ability.​ We believe that by having choice in play, they learn and grow in their own unique way.​ Environmental SustainabilityWe believe that it is our responsibility to care for and protect our environment. We believe that this desire to preserve our natural spaces begins by developing our innate curiosities and nurturing our bodies by spending as much time outside as possible. Parent InvolvementWe believe that parent involvement in preschool fosters a child’s sense of self-worth and security, and strengthens parenting skills. We value the importance of family and community in our children’s development. Community InvolvementWe believe in the importance of family and active participation in the community. WHY FOREST SCHOOL?
We believe that today's children are spending less time outside and more time indoors engaged in technology-driven activities. We believe that as parents and educators, it is our responsibility to steer our children away from this ""nature-deficit-disorder"" (LOUV, 2005).Since launching our forest school pilot program in September 2014, enrolment has more than doubled and interest in our school continues to grow. Now, in our second year, we have opened the forest to our first Kindergarten class.

In 2014, Gloria Lucas established NPP as a way to  address the importance of decolonization, historical trauma, eating disorders and body positivity. Trensitas, aims to expand on NPP’s mission by implementing the first comprehensive body-positive  and self love program for youth of color in Los Angeles.  Trensitas NPP Youth Nights Her-story In the summer of 2016, individuals from various neighborhoods in the Los Angeles area, gathered to design a youth program dedicated to empowering, enriching, and strengthening youth in our communities. Members of the Trensitas collective share varying common experiences in healing from eating disorders, tumultuous relationships with food and deconstructing unhealthy perceptions of body image. Trensitas, aims to break the isolation of youth of color who may also be struggling with eating disorders, food relationships, and unhealthy perceptions of body image.Through our upcoming program youth can expect to learn tools for:- healing and radical self-care-challenging the pressures of American beauty ideals-reclaiming identity, culture, and land. ❤  Meet The Trensitas Team  ❤Ourstorian, Social Media & Outreach CoordinatorAbriana Avila (She/her/they)Raised in Boyle Heights/East LaMy favorite foods would be tortas and Ramen!What I love about myself?

Yet, African-American girls between the ages of 11-14, score twice as high on 62 of the 64 Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) scales, than caucasian girls of the same age. (“Eating Disorders Affect Us All”, n.d.) Another study on body image and weight loss, indicates Latina 5th graders are more likely than caucasian students to have negative perceptions of their bodies and have negative associations with weight loss attempts.

love lies at the root of many of our social ills.  We are conditioned into a
pleasure/procreation paradigm by tactics of warfare. This keeps us in place. </p>
<p>It
is as if we are put in a locked closet with our sex and love lives.  I wish to break the lock and open the door,
to our internal power.  This
book is for anybody who is sexually active, regardless of how often.  There is something for everybody, even those
who disagree with my premises.</p>
<p>“FORBIDDEN:<i>The Alchemy of
Sacred Love</i>” is an expansive, comprehensive and integrated
overview of sex and love from a different perspective, beginning at the genetic
level in our bodies.  It is based on my
experience, research and intuition: a narrative text. I certainly do not know everything there is
to know about sex and love.  We are all
genetically unique, so it is impossible. </p>
<p>There is far more to sex and love than
I was aware of when I began this journey 15 years ago.  I share with you both my experience and that
which I have learned from others.  If you
consider the perspective suggested in the book, it makes things simpler and
could be worth a million dollars in your love life!  </p>
<p>There are many who have contributed to this work.  I began my research into sexual science with
Dr. Beverly Whipple.  Dr. Franceen King
was a great help, because today’s sexual science did not explain where I have
been.  Dr. John Perry also contributed
and even those with whom I strongly disagree, had something to offer.  I found much of what I was seeking was hidden
from common knowledge, but existed in other areas.</p>

</div><div> <p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>There are over 30 illustrations. The edited book needs professional artwork.  Much of the artwork I have is from Wikipedia and other sources on the net.  Some is in color and even gaudy.  I believe simple B&amp;W line drawings would more clearly get the message across.  I am a poet and technical writer, not an artist.  Although the current art suffices and some of it is pretty, it is not consistent. A local artist, Ms Julia Bertrand can do this work. This is an estimated $3000. (Phase 1.)</p>
<p>After the artwork, comes the publishing, lay out costs, printing costs, etc.  That can easily be $9000 in today’s economy. (Phase 2.)</p>
<p>I found in my research, everybody has an agenda.  Mine is authentic unity, leading to inter dependence.  Although I am geared for heterosexual monogamy, for all I know it might work with homosexuality or polygamy? </p>

<p>Your contribution will help me get this book out to the
public.  I do not offer a “right” way,
simply a different way of perceiving love, sex and life that can be beneficial
to those who consider it and those about them. 
I offer science, where available, to dispel myth.</p>
<p>This book impacts people. 
I have identified only a few sources of our erroneous belief systems,
yet it causes those who have read my draft manuscript to see with different
eyes.  Their reviews are at <a href=""http://www.thesacredfemale.com/alrev.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thesacredfemale.com/alrev.html</a>.
</p>
As a guy, I want a “reason”
for changing. Before I started this journey, I had only a vague awareness of
love and what it did.  In the book, I
offer a definition and show what it does. 
I laugh, because we don’t need a definition, just the expression.  I give what I believe is a reasonable
explanation for how it works and that, too, is immaterial.  It works. 
But, for guys, we now have a “reason.” </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Because of my experiences, and my research I am a very strong believer in this work.  I have a strong desire to inform the public, at least those willing to listen.  The biggest risk I face is in not being able to financia<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">lly get the book to market.  After that, I will do what it takes to get the book out.  That includes, If necessary, a book signing in Westboro, TN!  (It is a lot about love and I think they can use some.)</span></p>

The edited book needs professional artwork.  Much of the artwork I have is from Wikipedia and other sources on the net.  Some is in color and even gaudy.  I believe simple B&W line drawings would more clearly get the message across.  I am a poet and technical writer, not an artist.  Although the current art suffices and some of it is pretty, it is not consistent. A local artist, Ms Julia Bertrand can do this work. This is an estimated $3000. (Phase 1.)
After the artwork, comes the publishing, lay out costs, printing costs, etc.  That can easily be $9000 in today’s economy. (Phase 2.)
I found in my research, everybody has an agenda.  Mine is authentic unity, leading to inter dependence.  Although I am geared for heterosexual monogamy, for all I know it might work with homosexuality or polygamy? 
Thank you for your donation.  I greatly appreciate your helping me get this message out.   The Impact 
Your contribution will help me get this book out to the
public.  I do not offer a “right” way,
simply a different way of perceiving love, sex and life that can be beneficial
to those who consider it and those about them. 
I offer science, where available, to dispel myth.
This book impacts people. 
I have identified only a few sources of our erroneous belief systems,
yet it causes those who have read my draft manuscript to see with different
eyes.  Their reviews are at www.thesacredfemale.com/alrev.html.

As a guy, I want a “reason”
for changing. Before I started this journey, I had only a vague awareness of
love and what it did.  In the book, I
offer a definition and show what it does. 
I laugh, because we don’t need a definition, just the expression.  I give what I believe is a reasonable
explanation for how it works and that, too, is immaterial.  It works. 
But, for guys, we now have a “reason.”   Risks & Challenges Because of my experiences, and my research I am a very strong believer in this work.  I have a strong desire to inform the public, at least those willing to listen.  The biggest risk I face is in not being able to financially get the book to market.  After that, I will do what it takes to get the book out.  That includes, If necessary, a book signing in Westboro, TN!  (It is a lot about love and I think they can use some.)
    Other Ways You Can Help I am in the same boat as many out there and would be unable to contribute to my own campaign.  If you cannot contribute, I am asking you to help get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.  
You can use the Indiegogo share tools if nothing else!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I was inspired to use this format to fund  this project to build the Manna Healing Learning House, because the house's mission is to create community through teaching, learning, sharing and supporting one another's dreams. By crowd-funding, each contribution makes the Learning House a project that is made from the collaboration of individuals- strangers made friends- through a common desire to share in an undertaking that advances learning, truth, and love. </p>
<p>This campaign will fund: the design, construction and launching of a partially enclosed/ open-air learning space in Hawi, Hawaii, Big Island, U.S.A. It will be located on our Macadamia nut orchard and operating farm, where myself and my partner reside. The Learning House will be  a meeting place for people world-wide, to come together and create universal community for the sake of sharing knowledge, information and truth. </p>
<p>The Learning Houses's intended uses are for teaching: ThetaHealing classes and workshops, yoga, meditation, art, cooking, improvisation, writing, music, dance classes and more. We also plan to continue hosting International teachers with diverse areas of expertise who have the desire to offer workshops, seminars, and classes on a myriad of topics for students who are brave enough to believe in their ability to change the world. </p>

</div><div> <p>BEGINNINGS: To make this project viable, we enlisted an interior designer and master carpenter team, living here on the Big Island, to design a four-hipped 24'x24' covered structure with wrap-around lanai. We want to insure the learning house will last for years to come and that it is strong and sturdy to brave the climate of our beloved Kohala volcano where our classroom will reside. We already have our design drawn up, and estimates for materials are in. </p>
<p>SOURCING: We plan to source as much of our supplies as possible from local hardwoods and materials that are unaffected by the Hawaii climate and salvage as many materials as possible; as recycling and camp-fire policy of leaving our campsite cleaner than we arrived applies to the entire construction process. Because Hawaii is an island, everything that is not grown here must be imported. Approximately 2/3 of the funds raised through this campaign will be directed towards the costs of materials. We will place our order for materials at the end of March, 2016 and break ground April 1, our one year Hawaii Anniversary. </p>
<p>CREATING: Island time is a real thing; however, we intend to build this classroom quickly and have it up and running, with the plan to break ground as soon as our materials arrive in mid- late April. The construction itself will take a little over a month to complete. Doing this will require compensating our amazing design and construction team for their time and  efforts constructing the Learning House. </p>
<p>SHARING: We already have retreats planned for the summer months, and will be adding a section to our website, <a href=""http://www.manna-healing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.manna-healing.com</a> where you can learn about our retreat offerings and how to bring a retreat or workshop to the island to teach in the learning house. Once construction is complete, we will use a small portion of the remaining funding to apply and get our Learning House and Farm officially LLC licensed, as well as purchase liability insurance. With the remaining funding, we will purchase supplies for the Learning House and to create an advertising campaign, including content pages on our website to open the classroom to the world. </p>

<h3>Adventure in Iceland</h3>
<p>We both have been working in marine research in different locations and love Iceland for its magnificent seascapes and marine research opportunities. We would like to create a perfect research oasis for everybody who would benefit from its location as a sentinel site for arctic climate change monitoring. Furthermore, Iceland is centrally located between Europe and the Americas, with cheap airfares and practical travel times from most major cities. </p>
<p>ISAMS will offer unforgettable experiences to student groups and researchers: they can kayak the fjords with whales and seals (for the brave), hike a glacier (for the adventurous), watch the Northern Lights (for the romantic), or climb into a volcano crater (for the badass). These activities, and many others, will be done in partnership with the experienced local guides and small businesses that will help us make student experiences even more interesting, while also creating employment and sustainable income for the locals.</p>
<h3>Impact on the World</h3>
<p>We have already received commitments from the local university centre, the economic development agency, study abroad travel agencies, and numerous tour operators in Iceland, allowing us to offer students the best value for their travel budget.</p>
<p>Now we need your help to raise funds for the station facility, lab equipment, station vehicle and start-up operating cost – that’s where we will need you to help us over the finishing line. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>Hi I’m Melvin El, a four-time National Boxing champion and winner of the Olympic trials in 1988. I have also coached little boys who had never boxed before so well that they won national championships their first year. The secret of rapid success was teaching them to master the basics. After boxing, I started tutoring high school students at my local church. I began tutoring different high school students from various schools that couldn’t read which led me to believe that this could be an epidemic. I realized that by the time the students got to me it was extremely challenging to get them up to grade level. It was obvious that if I was going to attempt to change their reading abilities I would have to start with the younger students; this problem would have to be stopped at the source.</span></p>
<p>Years later, I became a single father to my 1 year old little girl and I wanted to teach her how to read. <b>One day I noticed that when Michael Jackson’s songs would come on the radio she would sing every single lyric with ease.</b> It was fun for her and she had somehow learned his lyrics verbatim. It was incredible. I began researching the science behind music and learning and discovered that music encourages the brain to pay attention. Armed with this information, I began utilizing music and phonics to ensure that she would master the basics of reading. She went on to skip 3 grades and gain a love for learning. My child had benefitted from this powerful method, therefore I knew it was <b>my job to teach children everywhere how to read.</b></p>
<p>My company, The Reading Reformation created the program, <b>Read Like A Genius With M.C. Ant Tanna</b> with the help of teachers with more than 30 years of experience. We are dedicated to teaching children how to read using music, phonics and engaging images which ensure that they master the reading basics quickly. We are passionate about our mission to teach children everywhere how to read. Because this is our passion we offered a FREE 7 day study for an inner city school class where children were struggling to read.The principal, Ms. Banky gave us 2 kindergarten classes with students that were not able to read. Seven days later the principal watched the post test take place and was amazed when she saw the children reciting 50-60 words fluently. Ms.Banky went on to say, “One way to ensure that children learn to read before they leave Kindergarten and First grade is by utilizing the program, Read Like a Genius.”</p>
<h3>Our Mission </h3>

This isn’t just about a single child. This is about scary statistics that state, in this current generation of America,<b> 1 out of 4 children are growing up functionally ILLITERATE.</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Other states have asked us to help their schools out as we did here in Florida. The first two cities we have targeted to conduct the same 7-day studies at are New York and Atlanta. We plan to teach 100 children to read in these cities where the reading scores are extremely low. The cost to cover all expenses and travel arrangements would be around $5,000.00 per city. However, we simply don’t have the funds. We really do need your help. You have the chance to be part of an amazing story of educational triumph. In fact, in this story, you would become the hero, a hero that helps to save a generation and leaves a legacy that will be remembered for many years. Whether you give just $5, $10 or $20, every single bit helps. If you are able to make a larger contribution of $1,000 or more, it will be much appreciated. But, be assured that we are so grateful for whatever you are willing to do…we believe that it will truly make a significant difference in the lives of our children.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Thank you so much for your time and your attention!</p></span></h3>

Hi I’m Melvin El, a four-time National Boxing champion and winner of the Olympic trials in 1988. I have also coached little boys who had never boxed before so well that they won national championships their first year. The secret of rapid success was teaching them to master the basics. After boxing, I started tutoring high school students at my local church. I began tutoring different high school students from various schools that couldn’t read which led me to believe that this could be an epidemic. I realized that by the time the students got to me it was extremely challenging to get them up to grade level. It was obvious that if I was going to attempt to change their reading abilities I would have to start with the younger students; this problem would have to be stopped at the source.
Years later, I became a single father to my 1 year old little girl and I wanted to teach her how to read. One day I noticed that when Michael Jackson’s songs would come on the radio she would sing every single lyric with ease. It was fun for her and she had somehow learned his lyrics verbatim. It was incredible. I began researching the science behind music and learning and discovered that music encourages the brain to pay attention. Armed with this information, I began utilizing music and phonics to ensure that she would master the basics of reading. She went on to skip 3 grades and gain a love for learning. My child had benefitted from this powerful method, therefore I knew it was my job to teach children everywhere how to read.
My company, The Reading Reformation created the program, Read Like A Genius With M.C. Ant Tanna with the help of teachers with more than 30 years of experience. We are dedicated to teaching children how to read using music, phonics and engaging images which ensure that they master the reading basics quickly. We are passionate about our mission to teach children everywhere how to read. Because this is our passion we offered a FREE 7 day study for an inner city school class where children were struggling to read.The principal, Ms. Banky gave us 2 kindergarten classes with students that were not able to read. Seven days later the principal watched the post test take place and was amazed when she saw the children reciting 50-60 words fluently. Ms.Banky went on to say, “One way to ensure that children learn to read before they leave Kindergarten and First grade is by utilizing the program, Read Like a Genius.”
Our Mission 
We have an ambitious, but totally doable mission of teaching children everywhere how to read. This isn’t just about a single child. This is about scary statistics that state, in this current generation of America, 1 out of 4 children are growing up functionally ILLITERATE.
Other states have asked us to help their schools out as we did here in Florida. The first two cities we have targeted to conduct the same 7-day studies at are New York and Atlanta. We plan to teach 100 children to read in these cities where the reading scores are extremely low. The cost to cover all expenses and travel arrangements would be around $5,000.00 per city. However, we simply don’t have the funds. We really do need your help. You have the chance to be part of an amazing story of educational triumph. In fact, in this story, you would become the hero, a hero that helps to save a generation and leaves a legacy that will be remembered for many years. Whether you give just $5, $10 or $20, every single bit helps. If you are able to make a larger contribution of $1,000 or more, it will be much appreciated. But, be assured that we are so grateful for whatever you are willing to do…we believe that it will truly make a significant difference in the lives of our children.
Thank you so much for your time and your attention!

With our program, students now are taught vital skills to gather basic information instead of expecting to always have it be given, process what it means to them and then form their own perspectives, points-of-view and begin to question the status quo.
This campaign will help to fund our Creative Thinking Program costs for over 1200 students for 2016 and into the following year.  We hate to put a cost per student, but when you can work with almost 1000 students a year for under $800, that proves the program is not only highly effective in improving students' learning, but also cost-efficient.
  What We Need & What You Get Here's what the money goes towards:  All funding will go directly to our Creative Thinking Program, first for all in-class materials and transportation to lessons.  This includes any lesson materials, printing or incentives (stickers work wonders).
Next up is for our Teacher Training Program, where we introduce the teachers to our curriculum and how they may be able to introduce those same skills within their lessons.  We do at least 3 training sessions per year, with attendees increasing each session.
 
Now here's what we can give you for your support;
 The knowledge that every penny you donate is used effectively and responsibly.  You are quite literally improving the life of a new student with each dollar you donate.

Not enough?  Any donation over $20 will also get a personal hand-written thank you letter from the Bulungi Team and a shout-out on our social pages (if you want that).

We'd give you more, but it all goes to the program.
    The Impact It's more than just lessons in class.  Supporting Bulungi supports the following as welll:  Equipping young students (grades 2 through 7) with skills to question and change everything in their lives will lead to positive change throughout the country.  As you solve for education, you solve for an entire generation of young men and women ready to take on all problems facing the country.

We love what we do, but it’s tough to grow crops and provide programs in winter. Now is the time to try something radical! 
We think food insecurity is a big deal
Last year we started asking how we could have more impact in Edmonton, and the answer we received was to help schools.
We asked teachers what it would take to get their students growing.  They said they needed training, teaching resources, and inexpensive, classroom-scale technologies that students could build and operate themselves.  So we began designing a program to enable teachers to grow food in their classrooms. 


Children are the most vulnerable to food insecurity, and our best hope for change. 
Addressing the issue of food insecurity requires a shift in thinking. We need to see ourselves as meaningful contributors, producers, and consumers within our food system.
To do this, we need to make urban agriculture accessible by providing practical solutions that we can use in schools and communities.
Prairie Urban Farm, an urban agriculture education and outreach centre located south of the University of Alberta, is going to take a big step towards tackling these hurdles, and increasing Edmonton’s awareness about urban agriculture, with the Farm on Wheels project.
Recent innovations in food production technologies now make it possible to bring the farm right to schools and communities in the heart of the city. 
That’s why Prairie Urban Farm is creating a hands-on, state-of-the-art teaching and outreach facility to show people how to grow food year-round in Edmonton. And the best part: it's mobile. 
Our Farm on Wheels project will convert a 40’ shipping container into a high intensity indoor farm, education centre, and research laboratory that is completely self-contained and can be moved to where it is needed.  


We will provide hands-on training programs and support for teachers wanting to bring food production experiences into the classroom or cafeteria.
At the heart of the program is a hydroponic vertical growing technology that works as a single standalone unit all the way up to a shipping container and greenhouse.


The ZipGrow technology made by Bright Agrotech LLC provides the ideal platform to integrate agriculture into classrooms and schools. It it is easy to use, and scalable; the knowledge and skills required to successfully grow food can be applied to one tower, or many.

It is possible for a group of motivated high school students to operate a shipping container farm and produce tremendous amounts of food. 
Imagine if each school had its own Farm on Wheels.
With your support we can get this project rolling; purchasing materials, growing crops and transforming a shipping container into a 365-day food factory that works in Edmonton’s short growing season.
The Perks
We have put together a number of Perks for this campaign that you can use to support yourself, your family, and your community grow food and help others join the local food movement. 


We're excited about our plantable Thank You card. We get to show you our appreciation for contributing to the campaign, and when you're done admiring your card, you can plant it into a container or garden.
If you don't have a container or garden planned for this season, we've put together a package of resources to make it easy!
We did some research and developed a great introductory webinar that walks you through a number of online resources to plan, design, and prepare your first or next garden.  Everyone that is registered for the downloadable webinar, will also receive digital copies of example garden designs that they can use in their garden or apartment.


For some, knowing which plants to select and where to buy them can be a daunting task in its own right. That's why we selected a number of traditional and exotic heirloom seed varieties from certified seed distributors and hand-made seed packets for your next garden adventure. 
Each Seed Package will contain enough seeds for a standard 4'x4' garden plot. Everyone that receives a Seed Package will also receive a digital copy of the example garden designs.

At the heart of our Perks are the ""Sponsor a teacher"" and ""Sponsor a school"" options. The #1 barrier that teachers struggle with is money, so we wanted to make sure that as many teachers as possible can benefit from this campaign. 
By sponsoring a teacher, you ensure that 30 more children in Edmonton are learning how to grow food and how food affects their health. We think that's a big deal.
Everyone who sponsors a teacher will also receive a half-day training at the Farm on Wheels so they can experience Urban Agriculture for themselves.
When you sponsor a school, up to five teachers can participate in our training program and Farm on Wheels will create a beautiful commemorative sign to display at the school.
Every dollar raised goes towards building the Farm on Wheels and developing the teaching resources for teachers.

Why We Need $100,000
The three biggest expenses are: 


purchasing the trailer ($15,000)
converting the shipping container into a food factory ($35,000)
purchasing the farm infrastructure ($30,000)





There are additional costs to: 
Produce open-source training materials, lesson plans, and educational resources for teachers that align with existing provincial curricula
Deliver teacher training workshops lead by knowledgeable University of Alberta staff and bringing University expertise to schools across Edmonton
Create our digital and print marketing so that we can continue to share our message, and 
Use the IndieGoGo platform.





Our goal is to have the Farm on Wheels ready for production by September 2016.  This pilot project will serve as a template for future farms, an open-source template that others can use and modify to suit their needs.
Join us in fixing the food system in Edmonton by sharing our story and supporting Edmonton teachers who want to get growing in their classrooms. It is time to activate urban agriculture in Edmonton.
If you can contribute through business relationships or skill sets, please contact us to let us know how you’d like to get involved. We are dreaming big and need your passion and interest to make this a reality.

This stage is concerned with the opening volumes of the edition, those dealing with Keynes's formative years at Eton and his early years at Cambridge University, including his first engagement with philosophy.  It is planned for these to be prepared in two batches of about 3 volumes each, one batch dealing with Eton and the other with early Cambridge.  Once these volumes are completed, a Stage 2 campaign will be launched for the next group of volumes, and so on.</p><p>The <u>stipulated</u> target for this campaign is USD$150,000.  Three key considerations have informed this choice.  One is that it keeps the project on track for 18 months to 2 years to finalise the Eton-related batch of volumes; these contain much new, important material that the world has not yet seen.  But this amount is not enough to finalise all the volumes in Stage 1.  The reason a higher amount hasn’t been stipulated lies in the second consideration. Under the Crowdfunding rules applicable to our campaign, donated funds must reach the stipulated target <u>within 60 days from the launch date</u> to enable the campaign to continue receiving funds after the 60 days.  Thus it becomes inadvisable to set too high a stipulated target, even when funds in excess of the stipulated target are actually required. Finally, the target is greater than USD$100,000, the amount that, at no cost to this campaign and with publisher cooperation, will allow one free online subscription for the full edition to a university in a developing country.  For each additional USD$100,000 thereafter, it is intended to donate another free online subscription.

This figure would also allow two universities in developing countries to receive free online subscriptions.  So, assuming we reach the stipulated target within 60 days, please keep making donations beyond this amount and beyond this time so that all the volumes in Stage 1 can be completed.  Our intention is that the campaign will remain open until Stage 1 is finalised.  And it will always be the case that any funds unspent in one stage will carry over to the next.</p><p>Also, please note that <u>all payments can be made only by credit card and only in US dollars (USD)</u>.  As explained in the Questions and Answers document, this requirement follows from constraints originating in the relevant Crowdfunding rules. </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476060319/kobzhgh5tky69spe7ygm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><b>How donated funds will be spent </b></p><p><u>1.

Document collection This encompasses travel to archives and private holdings to inspect their contents, and copy all relevant and significant documents for the edition.(a) Travel by myself for inspection and copying of material.  These trips, usually of 14-16 days duration, are very time-intensive and highly focused in exploring, evaluating and collecting as much material as possible in the time. (b) Travel by selected Keynes scholars who are geographically closer to the archive in question, possess archival experience, and act under my guidance.This item, which only includes travel expenses and not salary or wage income, comprises about 15% of funds.In addition, smaller sums of money will be spent to expedite the preparation of the edition, including photocopying expenses when photography is not permitted in an archive, purchases of any government documents that assist, especially in regard to personal details that might help track down missing or additional papers, and the translation of passages of Latin and Greek.  This item is less than 1% of funding. A multi-disciplinary figureKeynes’s writings are not just focused on economic and financial matters. Philosophy, politics, history, social policy, the arts, and visions for the future are also important subjects in his writings. The edition will thus facilitate more informed research in all these other disciplines.  He made pioneering contributions to the philosophy of probability, and advanced a political philosophy seeking to combine progressive forces (though not revolutionary ones).  Not only did he help make history, but he was always conscious of its central role in the development of ideas and current events. He also contributed, directly and indirectly, to many social policy advances that promoted greater social justice, and he was passionate about supporting all fields in the arts.  Other ways you can helpThere are other ways in which you can help the JMK Writings Project:·  Everyone −Spread the word.  Tell people you know who might be interested about the project, such as friends, students, colleagues, businesspeople, policy-makers, philanthropists etc.  And like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/JMK-Writings-Project-621795491315694/·  Teachers – whether at university or high school, you might organise a class donation of small individual contributions (with a possible ‘perk’ to be won).·  Keynes scholars and archivists – please keep an eye out for documents relevant to the edition from any period in Keynes’s life.  I don’t have complete knowledge of the contents of all archives, and there are certainly some holdings of which I am unaware such as any collections in some non-English speaking countries.  If you have come across documents outside the big or relatively well-known archives, please send an email to jmkwritingsproject@gmail.com, even if you think I might already know about them.·  Academics – if you would like to contribute in some way to the editorial process, please contact me with suggestions.  Such contributions could include being an editor of an individual volume (either alone or in partnership with another person including myself), or assisting in the preparation of a major series of documents for any volume.  These can be future volumes, not necessarily those under current preparation. For this, you don’t necessarily need an economics background.  Your skills as a philosopher, political scientist or historian, for example, might be just what is needed.  All such assistance will be fully acknowledged in the usual ways.  Every donation, of every size, will make a differenceFor further information about the edition and campaign, see Questions and Answers at https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8625ZYgm1ogc0I4QXZ2U1A0OVU.Please help us ensure that:                                              In the long run, JMK lives.  Notes1.

They can gain access to hundreds of mentoring organizations from around the world, or simply gain access to one person who can open doors of opportunity that they only dreamed about. <br/><br/>For those who already have access to a mentor (through a traditional mentoring organization or other source), now they have a platform to connect with these role models and mentors daily, throughout the year, even during holidays and school vacations.

<section><p>Welcome to The Danish Church’s Crowdfunding site.</p>
<p>There has been a Danish Church in London 
since 1692, and since 1952 the beautiful St Katharine’s Church in 
Regent’s Park has been the Danish congregation’s home. Today the Church 
is more in demand than ever. Every year thousands of Danes and all nationals with an interest in Danes and Denmark, gather at St 
Katharine’s for religious, cultural and social events.</p>
<h3>Why<br/>
</h3>
<p>The Danish Church in London is a privately funded church and does not 
receive funding from the Danish State or the Danish Church. Apart from 
the pastor’s salary, which is financed by the Danish Church Abroad/Danish Seamen's Church, we rely entirely on the income from membership fees, 
fundraising, collections and gifts. The number of people who benefit 
from the Danish Church’s work far exceeds the number of people who are 
paying members. <br/></p>
<p>We welcome and pay great attention to people from all walks of life. <br/></p>
<p>Your donation will help future generations of Danes in 
London keep in touch with their Danish language and culture.<br/></p>

Welcome to The Danish Church’s Crowdfunding site.
There has been a Danish Church in London 
since 1692, and since 1952 the beautiful St Katharine’s Church in 
Regent’s Park has been the Danish congregation’s home. Today the Church 
is more in demand than ever. Every year thousands of Danes and all nationals with an interest in Danes and Denmark, gather at St 
Katharine’s for religious, cultural and social events.
Why

The Danish Church in London is a privately funded church and does not 
receive funding from the Danish State or the Danish Church. Apart from 
the pastor’s salary, which is financed by the Danish Church Abroad/Danish Seamen's Church, we rely entirely on the income from membership fees, 
fundraising, collections and gifts. The number of people who benefit 
from the Danish Church’s work far exceeds the number of people who are 
paying members. 
We welcome and pay great attention to people from all walks of life. 
Your donation will help future generations of Danes in 
London keep in touch with their Danish language and culture.
The project



The Church urgently needs more space for 
activities and a comprehensive refurbishment. A project to meet these 
demands has been designed by C.F. Møller Architects, London. 50 percent 
of the project cost is being donated by the A.P. Møller Foundation, and 
in addition, the Danish Church is honoured to have received support from The 
Queen Margrethe’s and Prince Henrik’s Foundation. We are pleased to announce that Pandora was the first Danish Company in London to
launch their support to the building project.
Check out the Official Fundraising website here about the building project and the various ways we are looking to raise funds.  
We need you and all donations are welcome whether you are Danish or not, whether you live in London or not. 
Every Pound Counts 



We need a total of £2.5m to complete the refurbishment and extension. With the 50% covered through one major pledge by the AP Møller Foundation we in effect are looking for £1.25m - check how far we are here.   
All funds will go to this project. Should we not get to our 
Crowdfunding goal here, we will keep on fundraising directly to get to 
the goal - your money will not be wasted. 

You can also donate directly to the Church and we benefit extra from reclaiming the tax. As a UK Registered Charity we can reclaim the tax element on donations through the GiftAid scheme, for UK tax paying individuals. Contact us for details. 



 Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute with funds, that doesn't mean you can't help:  Please spread the word and make some noise about our campaign. Why not use the share tools on this site to Facebook, twitter etc.

an international school located on a historical site in SW Shanghai, China/  When I arrived at SHSID in 2008 I had no idea
my school’s campus was the former site of the WWII Lunghwa internment camp.  I read ‘Empire of the Sun’ in the US before I
came to Asia and briefly met J.G. Ballard in San Francisco at a book
signing.  Before coming to China I taught
English in Osaka, Japan working on various WWII related research projects in
between my day-to-day teaching.</p>
<p>The app began as a student History Club project with two 9<sup>th</sup>
graders Cheryl and Ruby providing much of the content and a programmer they
recruited from the school computer club, Brian. 
Together we got the app to the level where we realized we needed to give
it to a professional app technician in order to publish it.  We also realized that to convert the android
files to iOS and make a version for Apple iPads we would need a professional’s
expertise as well.  Thus, our appeal to
you.</p>
<p>We first asked our school administration for help but we hit
a brick wall.  Our institution is a
Chinese elite state school with a international division where I work.  All our superiors are members of the ruling
CCP which looks upon the history of the Lunghwa with a certain ambivalence.  As it is the story of the Japanese treating
colonial era Western residents of Shanghai with a certain amount of humanity,
it does not fit into the approved narrative of the Red Army liberating
China.  There are a few references to the
camp in our official history, but no plaques nor monuments on campus.  There is concern that the remaining original
buildings might someday be demolished so we are working on the project with
utmost speed.</p>
<p>We need about 13-15 hours of professional programming work
to make the app complete in working order, ready to distribute.  The estimate is $1500 USD.  We have a sympathetic programmer ready to
give us the lowest possible rate for labor.</p>
<p>By funding our app you would help make the legacy of Lunghwa
C.A.C. permanent.  Users of the app would
get a virtual tour of the campus, read the inside story of the Dining Hall,
Assembly Centre, the guards’ and commandants barracks, and D, E, and F
Blocks.  They would hear the sound bites
from Ms. Betty Barr, the last surviving internee still living in Shanghai, now
nearly 90 years old.  We could also
consider being able to fund an Apple iOS version as well as Chinese translated
app.</p>
<p>We have received messages of support from other Lunghwa
survivors who would like to tell the story of their camp experience to their
children and grandchildren and would be happy to use our app to do so.</p>
<p>All contributors would receive a beta version of the
app.  Larger contributors over $100 will
receive a personal guided tour of the SHSID campus by the faculty advisor and
the students in the History Club when they come to Shanghai.</p>

As a performer, I’ve played on stages and screens in Chicago and Boston, including the Second City Training Center’s Musical House Ensemble.Now I’ve combined these fields to create Science with Sophie, a science comedy show for girls. Working in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math), there’s a clear problem: We don’t have enough women. The National Science Foundation reports that women make up only 30% of STEM professionals in the United States.Not only is this true in the lab, the hospital, or the science museum, it’s reflected in the media we watch every day. I’ve noticed it since I was a child, and it hasn’t changed. If I notice it, other women and girls notice too.When I was growing up, I had some really stellar children’s programming to enjoy and learn from. The problem: the hosts of these science shows were all men. The closest thing I had to a female role model in science was Miss Frizzle from The Magic School Bus, and she was a cartoon. It’s been more than two decades since the wonderful show Bill Nye the Science Guy first aired. In over twenty years of stellar educational television, we have yet to see a strong female science role model with substantial reach. Together, we can change that.Science with Sophie is my solution to this serious problem. It’s a fun, fast-paced, upbeat science show that uses comedy and a female host to inspire girls to do science every day.A little more about the showSophie Science hosts the series. She is bright, fun, and ready for anything. The audience will join her on adventures around the city, showing girls that there is science all around them; whether they’re on a street, in a park, at home, or on a bus, science is everywhere! Together, Sophie and the girls watching do experiments that use materials found around the house, so anyone and everyone can try something new. Episodes include experiments, recurring segments, different genres, songs, behind-the-scenes peeks at cool science jobs, and more!Along the way, we meet Sophie’s wacky cast of characters: a super-buff water molecule, a skeptical microscope, a loving Mother Earth, and a rapping brain, to name a few. The whole gang will encourage girls that they can be anything they want to be.Sophie Science also interviews experts in all kinds of surprising science careers. The show highlights how diverse STEM careers can be: the jobs, and the incredible women doing them. Science with Sophie also features field-report-style interviews with kids about all kinds of science topics. It’s a fast-paced, fun-filled, joyful exploration of the world around us, with every discovery leading to a new question, a new idea, and a new episode.The Creative TeamThe all-female writing team is comprised of scientists, educators, child development specialists, and comedians. The team spans Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Boston and Alaska.We have a talented crew ready to go: a production company, musicians, sets, designers and more. Now we need YOU!Funding the FunOur immediate goal is to raise enough money to get this series off the ground. One year of funding will support the show’s pilot season and help get Science With Sophie in front of girls across the country.Here are some of the things we need money for:
Equipment  rentals
Locations and sets
Transportation
Travel costs to interview STEM experts
Lighting
Sound
Props and wardrobe
Insurance and legal
Pre-production
Actually filming the episodes
Stipends for the writing team and crew - it’s important to pay artists for their work!
Food for hungry staff during 12-hour shoots
Post-production
But the show is just the beginning. With enough support, Science with Sophie can expand to curriculum development, after-school programs, online resources, and so much more.“When can I see the show?”Early 2017! Stay tuned for channel/internet release updates.Material Science (...the perks)We're excited about all the perks offered, but I want to call out a few:Want a personalized science song, or an answer to a science question you’ve always had? Get them made-to-order by Sophie Science! I, Sophie, will write you (or a kid you know) a mini song about a science topic of your choice, or make a customized video just for you.I work at the largest science center in the Western Hemisphere: the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois. You and five guests can explore the over 14 acres of exhibits and get a behind-the-scenes tour with Sophie Science.Science with Sophie is all about showcasing amazing women. We commissioned a campaign-exclusive poster from registered nurse and artist Bridget Maley. The poster features a quote from the show and looks stunning on any wall.Even More EvidenceEducational television has the power to create memories, foster relationships, inspire, and set examples for millions of people across the globe. I want to use that scope to show girls people who look and sound like them, and ignite their internal fire to become the future female scientists we need.Girls are naturally curious, inquisitive, brave, and thoughtful. Science With Sophie is designed to remind them that they are all of those things, even when they might hear otherwise. Girls are everything they need to be, and they are scientists.Exposure to scientific thought and engineering practices can help girls be more responsible and productive global citizens, no matter what career path they choose. How would the world be different if politicians solved problems like engineers? How would society change if businesses thought like scientists? How would a girl be inspired if she saw a smart, strong, fun woman doing science on TV?Let's Make It HappenThe time is now, the place is here, the support is you.  Every donation helps make Science with Sophie a reality. Let’s give today’s girls a platform to flourish as tomorrow’s scientists, engineers, and world changers.Check out the perks to find the one that’s right for you. If you aren’t able to contribute dollars, you can help tremendously by sharing this page with your own network! Spread the word on Facebook, Instagram, email, with actual face-to-face conversations, through sidewalk chalk… feel free to get creative, scientist. Thank you!",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

It’s a non-political and non-profit registered organization in Ministry of Economy I.R.A.</p><p>HELA has partnered with THIMUN Qatar, TASMUN Taiwan, the John Boroughs School of America, Online Model United Nations, and Best Delegate, to develop Model United Nations in Afghanistan. Its goals are:</p><ul>
<li>Develop Afghan youth leadership skills</li>
<li>Enable Afghan youth to think creatively and passionately about the future</li>
<li>Create problems-solvers for Afghanistan</li>
<li>Provide equal opportunity for males and females in Afghanistan</li>
<li>To introduce Afghan talented youth to the world</li>
<li>To introduce global culture and issues to Afghan youth</li>
<li>To engage Afghan in national and international leadership conferences</li>
<li>Finally to create the future leaders of Afghanistan</li>
</ul><p>Through partnership with many international organizations, HELA has been able to engage:</p><ul>
<li>Three of our young students in TASMUN conference - March - 2015 </li>
<li>One of our young leaders in the  Qatar Leadership Conference (QLC) – October – 2015</li>

</ul><p>And many more opportunities inside the country, as since establishment of the organization we have promoted Model United Nations in Afghanistan:</p><ul>
<li>SKATEISTAN international organization with 20 male and 20 female students</li>
<li>Youth union organization with 40 Male and 35 Female students</li>
<li>Dawodzai Center – HELA’s main office with 30 Male and 30 Female students</li>
</ul><p>Additionally, we have spread Model United Nation to many other organizations and schools.</p><p>Our aim is to take Afghanistan Model United Nations program to each part/corner of Afghanistan and engage Afghan youth from each place of Afghanistan in this project.</p><p>The only way to achieve this goal is to hold our first-ever Afghanistan Model United Nations conference for 100 University level students with 50/50 gender representation. This is not possible without financial backing which should cover all expenses for the conference.</p><p>Every dollar you donate will help us achieve this goal!</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>Please refer to the budget sheet bellow and get to know how your money will be spent:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475398892/tiofc4bkg5aqk5ogyq3g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The outcomes of this conference are extremely significant and valuable:</p><ul>
<li>100 Afghan youth will engage in such exciting projects such as MUN, public speaking, and leadership training.</li>
<li>We will deliver 100 new male and female youth leaders to Afghanistan and the world</li>
<li>Afghan youth will experience for the first time a conference</li>
<li>Will enhance their leadership, problem solving, public speaking and debating skills</li>
</ul><p><strong>Impact of the Project:</strong></p><p>Model United Nations, also known as Model UN, Mock UN or MUN, is an educational simulation and/or academic competition in which students can learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. MUN involves and teaches the indispensable skills of researching, public speaking, debating, and writing, in addition to critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities. Usually an extracurricular activity, some schools also offer MUN as a class. Participants in Model UN conferences, known as delegates, are placed in committees and assigned countries, or occasionally other organizations or political figures, where they represent members of that body. They are presented with their assignments in advance, along with a topic or topics that their committee will discuss. Delegates conduct research before conferences and formulate positions that they will then debate with their fellow delegates in the committee, staying true to the actual position of the member they represent. At the end of a conference, the best-performing delegates in each committee, as well as delegations, are sometimes recognized with awards. MUN exists in more than 100 countries around the world.</p><p>AFMUN, or Afghanistan Model United Nations, is the first MUN program in Afghanistan, which was started by HELA. Now HELA is committed to prepare first ever Afghanistan Model United Nations Conference on 26<sup>th</sup> - 28<sup>th</sup> October - 2016 in one of the largest universities of Afghanistan.

Dawodzai Center – HELA’s main office with 30 Male and 30 Female students
Additionally, we have spread Model United Nation to many other organizations and schools.Our aim is to take Afghanistan Model United Nations program to each part/corner of Afghanistan and engage Afghan youth from each place of Afghanistan in this project.The only way to achieve this goal is to hold our first-ever Afghanistan Model United Nations conference for 100 University level students with 50/50 gender representation. This is not possible without financial backing which should cover all expenses for the conference.Every dollar you donate will help us achieve this goal!What We Need & What You GetPlease refer to the budget sheet bellow and get to know how your money will be spent: The outcomes of this conference are extremely significant and valuable:
100 Afghan youth will engage in such exciting projects such as MUN, public speaking, and leadership training.
We will deliver 100 new male and female youth leaders to Afghanistan and the world
Afghan youth will experience for the first time a conference
Will enhance their leadership, problem solving, public speaking and debating skills
Impact of the Project:Model United Nations, also known as Model UN, Mock UN or MUN, is an educational simulation and/or academic competition in which students can learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. MUN involves and teaches the indispensable skills of researching, public speaking, debating, and writing, in addition to critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities. Usually an extracurricular activity, some schools also offer MUN as a class. Participants in Model UN conferences, known as delegates, are placed in committees and assigned countries, or occasionally other organizations or political figures, where they represent members of that body. They are presented with their assignments in advance, along with a topic or topics that their committee will discuss. Delegates conduct research before conferences and formulate positions that they will then debate with their fellow delegates in the committee, staying true to the actual position of the member they represent. At the end of a conference, the best-performing delegates in each committee, as well as delegations, are sometimes recognized with awards. MUN exists in more than 100 countries around the world.AFMUN, or Afghanistan Model United Nations, is the first MUN program in Afghanistan, which was started by HELA. Now HELA is committed to prepare first ever Afghanistan Model United Nations Conference on 26th - 28th October - 2016 in one of the largest universities of Afghanistan. A hundred participants with 50/50 gender representation will attend this conference. Our aim is to:
Introduce UN procedure to able them to create solutions for problems which currently facing the globe
Establish a society free of poverty and discrimination, where there is equality among citizens, citizens’ rights are respected, and they actively participate in the democratic process for establishing those rights
Empower youth by providing Model United Nations conference on international level, enhance their awareness on rights, and provide access to resources for their socio-economic benefit
Our programs contribute to improve the social, economic and physical resources available to and controlled by a community
Advertise STOP illegal Immigration to Afghan youth
Create the future leaders of Afghanistan
We believe:
In the power of education and the collaborative process of problem solving and consensus building, and seek to foster leadership and positive engagement through discussion and debate of the world’s most pressing problems
That there is intrinsic worth in bringing together young people of different backgrounds and ethnicities to lay a foundation for trust and mutual respect
That debate, discussion and online collaborative projects are all creative and educationally strong methods to enhance the educational opportunities for Afghan youth.
It can best serve youth through a non-political, student led organization that is inclusive of all ethnicities, political views, socio-economic status and genders.  
Risks & ChallengesThere are only two challenges to which we need to have a proactive action as bellow:Financial:This conference has some costs as (food, transportation, venue, training supplies etc.) which are well explained in the budget sheet above.Our solution for this was to start an online campaign and ask people from around the globe to help us in this regard and to contribute some money to make this happen!Security:The global community is well aware of the current security situation in Afghanistan that; Afghanistan is currently suffering in insecurity and everyday a suicide bombing and side street bombing is happening.Our solution for this is to:
Hold the conference in a very well established university which has tight security.
Provide transportation for female students.
Provide safe and healthy food for all the participants.

<h2>Fragmented Reality</h2>
<p>The school I'm working at has no extracurricular activities or outlets for the students. They have no sports teams or cheerleading squads, no band or art club, no drama team or any way to express themselves in a healthy way. The school system has very little money, and way less interest in investing in these kinds of things, and the handful teachers who are willing to spend their own time to start these programs face an uphill battle against apathy and degredation, but the worst part of it all is that because of the great distances most kids would have to travel to get to school, many of them stay in on-campus dorms from Monday to Friday. Which means they have a lot of down time, with almost nothing to do.</p>
<p>I want to start an extra curricular art program, I have the teacher support, and necessary skillset, but I need your help to do it. I want to introduce the students to mosaics and provide them with the basic necessities to make their own works of art; something that they can not only be proud of making, but also a healthy outlet of self-expression that they can possibly even sell in the summer when tourists from Santiago and Argentina flood the region.</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Bradley, I'm an aspiring travel writer, and semi professional vagabond. Throughout my travels, I've been constantly astounded, and often left speechless as to the selflessness that many of these people demonstrate by accepting me into their homes, and into their hearts. I have been making mosaic table art by upcycling plastics for almost two years, but I have just recently taken my projects on the road with me. During this time I've been able to share a lot of memories with a lot of fellow world travelers and made some cool stuff with world citizens, now I'm ready to tell the world about it. </p>
<p>I have been hooked on mosaic artwork ever since I saw the impact Antoni Gaudí had on the landscape and skyline of Barcelona. I dream that one day, my mosaic work will evoke in others the same feelings I felt while staring at La Casa Batlló, or sitting at La Parque Güell. I truly believe that, just like mosaics, we are all differently shaped fragments of reality, and if you are ever able to take a step back, you can truly see the beauty of the bigger picture. </p>
<p>I am currently working as a volunteer English teacher in a small pueblecito in southern Chile. Teaching has undoubtedly been an incredible experience, and I spend most of my days getting my students to yell, jump around, throw things, and laugh, all within the structure of practicing English. I've thoroughly enjoyed investing my time and energy into these kids and encouraging them to explore a whole new world beyond their customary language boundaries, but the end of the semester will soon be upon us, and much like Mary Poppins, I must leave when the wind changes.</p>
<p>Before I go I want to leave a lasting impact on my students, and I want to introduce to them the beauty of mosaic art, which I hope will not only equip them with an alternate form of artistic expression and income, but will also inspire them to hit the road, and see these works of art for themselves.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>First off, since I am creating my own website, I will only need about one third of the goal amount in order to purchase and construct my web domain. I wasn't planning on asking for this much, but Indiegogo's minimum amount is $500, so I hope to use whatever I have left over after finishing the project I'm currently working on to buy mosaic materials for my students.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Like I said I'm in the middle of another project here</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> in Llifén, but considering how isolated this town is from</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> the rest of the region</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>, it is slightly more difficult to procure the proper materials, and requires a lot of time traveling. I plan on using any remaining funds I have left over to buy the necessary materials and create instructions for students here at Liceo Rural Llifén, so that they can also learn about Gaudí, and continue exploring worlds apart from their own.</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contributing to my campaign is about more than upcycling plastic into artwork, or posting long and strange trips written by a wandering vagabond. It's about providing kids from another side of the world with the opportunity to explore an art form that up until now, has previously only existed as an abstraction. When I first heard about Antoni Gaudí, I too was just a high school student, and he was a strange man who made crazy mosaics in a faraway place. Traveling and making something like that was simply an abstract thought in the back of my mind, but years later, when I was standing in front of buildings I had only seen in pictures, I discovered that it was a true passion of mine to travel, and continue exploring mosaic art.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My biggest challenge comes from collecting the materials needed to complete my work. I have discovered that regardless of which country I'm in, none of them use quite the same words, and Chileno is of course no exception, but with each day, I learn a little bit more, and my work still continues. </p>
<p>Apart from knowing what to ask for, my only other challenge has been the distance traveled to find these materials. Since much of Chile, outside of Santiago, has a much smaller, rural population, some materials are slightly more expensive than expected, but I'm learning where to look, and what to ask for, and so far, I've successfully completed one project, and am halfway through another one. I believe that with your help I can complete the project at hand, as well as finish one or two other pieces before I continue on.</p>

<h3>Other ways that you can help</h3>

Share this link with your friends and family to help me get the word out, as well as keep in touch with me through my web site once it's created.

The fund is still far off from being financially liquid but a testimony is that we were able to support one student who was in need for 2 months on a weekly basis. I do hope that one day the fund grows and supports many people because the need is great. As a person: I am a motivational speaker, often using my life as evidence to communicate that there is no boundary upon any life that cannot be moved by determination and action towards a brighter day. My conduct in motivation has inspired many to do admirable things that under normal circumstances are impossible given their background.2016: Student Leader for the 9tenths Mentoring Programme. I lead a team of 14 mentors assigned to mentor grade 12 learners at Marry Waters High School. The programme is Dr Mabizela’s (Rhodes University Vice Chancellor) initiative that seeks to forester academic awareness that will breed excellence and hopefully increase the number of grade 12 pupils that qualify for university at the end of the year in two selected public schools around Grahamstown.I belief it is these acts that have invited recognition from diverse organization, such including the inclusion in the Investec Rhodes Top 100 in years 2014 and 2015 for general excellence and student leadership respectively, the Mandela Rhodes Scholarship award last year, the recent selection to attend the Brightest Young Minds Summit held in Johannesburg and finally selection to represent my generation at the One Young World Summit in Ottawa Canada, end of September this year.Attending this summit affords me a chance to meet bright young minds from across the world purposed towards the same goals of creating better societies. I seek to draw inspiration and connect with people furthering the same goal. Because I am a people centred person, my development is a great investment to any community that I may find myself in. It is by this that I seek sponsorship for this trip.

<p><strong>A Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>As the parents of a teen with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) we know how difficult it can be to find a place where our kids can have fun with peers with similar interests. A place where they can feel secure, build long-term friendships, and work on social skills at the same time. We think <u><i>Art is a great vehicle</i></u> to bring the kids and families together on a regular basis to work on projects, to learn and to interact.  Signing up for a Perk will help us keep Art Club going for the next six months <i>at no cost to the families</i>. And most importantly, it will help make a bunch of kids smile – Thanks for your help!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Picking a Perk will help cover our location costs, for things like, heat, light, power and insurance; will cover costs incurred to create and produce our funding campaign; help cover modest Instructor &amp; Assistant costs; pay for Art Supplies and other needs ranging from paint, canvas, paper, tools, pencils, markers, drinks, snacks, and more. In addition, your Perk will help pay for Indiegogo fees, processing fees, and finally costs for the Perks themselves!</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how we see it:</strong></p>
<p>Location Costs                                                                $    120</p>
<p>Marketing &amp; Production Costs                                  $    350</p>
<p>Art Supplies                                                                     $    600</p>

<p>Instructor &amp; Assistant Costs (6 months)              $  1,200</p>
<p>Perk Costs, Indiegogo &amp; Processing Fees             $     550</p>
<p>CAMPAIGN TOTAL                                                        $ 3,000</p>
<p><strong>We would <i>love</i> to get you one our Perks!</strong> </p>
<p>Everyone getting a Perk will receive a <i>loud</i>  Thank You recording via email from the whole group.  I know you’ll be able to hear the kids and parents’ enthusiasm!! We’ll create a great looking post card featuring some of our art, or a picture of a class and send it to you with a personalized thank you, along with a jpeg art file for you to enjoy, print out, or turn it into a wallpaper background for your computer. </p>
<p>At higher levels, we’ll create and ship one or more high quality signed prints of an original Art Club work; and at the highest level you’ll get a professionally framed signed original Giclée print that will use fade-resistant, archival inks and archival substrates to ensure that your Art Club original will last.  Please check out the details for each Perk, and again, Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The impact of your Perk really can’t be understated.  Your participation will help give us and the families of Art Club the peace of mind knowing that the program will be there for our kids for at least the next six months without stretching already tight budgets for all of us.  Raising a son or daughter with ASD costs on average $ 11,000 more per year than raising a neuro-typical child; so, every Perk truly helps.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Hey, we <i>really</i> understand watching your finances!  And, we know not everyone can Pick a Perk Today, so if you can’t - <u><i>Please</i></u> share the Art Club Campaign with those who you think might want to participate.  In any case, thanks for spreading our story.</p>

Probabilitatea că o să reușim să deschidem cuiva gura e cu atât mai mare, cu cât suma adunată va fi mai mare. Probabil oamenii dinăuntru își vor începe a pune întrebări dacă trecem peste 2-3 mii de euro. Este o investiție în presa liberă și o tentativă de a lupta cu minciunile și știrile false. Noi promitem să transmitem actualizări despre colectarea de fonduri, sursele care ne contactează, informația ce o răspândim, rețelele de distribuție a informației etc. Totodată, dacă aveți idei despre o colectare mai eficientă de fonduri, de luptă cu minciunile, de metode prin care să ajungem la mințile oamenilor afectați direct de știrile mincinoase, vă îndemnăm să ne scrieți. Această colectare de fonduri este doar un început, într-o luptă îndelungată cu știrile false, minciunile, trolli plătiți care vor să divizeze societatea și să semene ură.

Vrem să ajungem la cât mai mulți potențiali donatori.</p><p><strong>Cum ești protejat?</strong><br/>Motivul din care am făcut această campanie pe Indiegogo este pentru a evita rețelele naționale. E o măsură de precauție pentru a oferi posibilitatea anonimatului pentru cei ce doresc să și-l păstreze, dar vor să doneze. Numele vostru nu va fi dat public. Nu este în interesul nostru. <br/>De asemenea, de această campanie este legat un cont de card dinafara Moldovei, deci sistemul financiar din Moldova nu are absolut nici o legătură. Băgați niște bani. 10, 20, 30 de euro. Este o investiție în viitorul presei libere. </p><p><strong>Și dacă nu cheltuim toți banii? </strong><br/>Planul nostru este să asigurăm o așa campanie, încât să convingem nu doar un om să vorbească. O să scoatem informația la lumină și o să remunerăm cât mai multe surse. <br/>Dacă, totuși, ne rămân bani, o să finanțăm o altă idee similară ce are același scop - lupta cu dezinformarea prin intermediul trollilor politici. <br/>Spre exemplu, un hackathon dedicat exclusiv subiectului dat. O să mai găsim ceva bani, o să arătăm banii adunați ca și cofinanțare și o să anunțăm un concurs de idei la subiectul dat și vom finanța nu una, ci trei.

Această colectare de fonduri este doar un început, într-o luptă îndelungată cu știrile false, minciunile, trolli plătiți care vor să divizeze societatea și să semene ură. Pentru orice contribuție, vă mulțumim! Dacă ești jurnalistAtunci avem mare nevoie de ajutorul tău pentru a răspândi informația despre această campanie. Vrem să ajungem la cât mai mulți potențiali donatori.Cum ești protejat?Motivul din care am făcut această campanie pe Indiegogo este pentru a evita rețelele naționale. E o măsură de precauție pentru a oferi posibilitatea anonimatului pentru cei ce doresc să și-l păstreze, dar vor să doneze. Numele vostru nu va fi dat public. Nu este în interesul nostru. De asemenea, de această campanie este legat un cont de card dinafara Moldovei, deci sistemul financiar din Moldova nu are absolut nici o legătură. Băgați niște bani. 10, 20, 30 de euro. Este o investiție în viitorul presei libere. Și dacă nu cheltuim toți banii? Planul nostru este să asigurăm o așa campanie, încât să convingem nu doar un om să vorbească. O să scoatem informația la lumină și o să remunerăm cât mai multe surse. Dacă, totuși, ne rămân bani, o să finanțăm o altă idee similară ce are același scop - lupta cu dezinformarea prin intermediul trollilor politici. Spre exemplu, un hackathon dedicat exclusiv subiectului dat. O să mai găsim ceva bani, o să arătăm banii adunați ca și cofinanțare și o să anunțăm un concurs de idei la subiectul dat și vom finanța nu una, ci trei. Toate cheltuielile vor fi transparente și fiecare donator va primi informație despre acestea.Vă îndemnăm să contribuiți și să distribuiți această campanie. Inițiatorii campaniei: Dumitru AlaibaVlada Ciobanu Orice susținere pentru această campanie este importantă. Urmează mai multe activități unde avem nevoie de susținerea voastră. Dacă vreți să faceți parte din echipă, vă îndemnăm să ne contactați.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

 WHAT WE DO. 

Kilimanjaro Initiative USA (KI-USA), is a non-profit providing underserved youth with the opportunities, guidance and tools to reach NEW HEIGHTS.  Every year we sponsor 3-4  NYC youth leaders between the ages of 18-25 on a 3 week leadership program in Africa where the peak activity is to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro.Those selected have demonstrated a commitment to social change and the advancement of themselves and their communities. We seek to expose, challenge and equip them with life lessons that will only serve to amplify their greatness.
WHO WE ARE. 
People who care about advancing talent and igniting hope - one adventure at a time. For 5 years we have made this opportunity accessible to a total of 14 young people. Our dedicated Chairman, Board, their friends, family and colleagues have been supporting KI-USA's efforts since Day One. This year KI-USA is taking it to the next level!  In our first year with nonprofit status we have been working closely with a handful of our former sponsored youth. We hope to continue to expand on our commitment to support them in their growth - both personal and professional.

Our educational program promotes harmony between physical and digital learning, while giving children a solid foundation in all areas of life.  How are we different?Unlike our competitors, who mostly teach cognitive skills only with their apps, we spent 5 years of research identifying the most widespread educational approaches as points of reference for our own system, which enables us to draw inspiration from truly the best. We even looked at traditional learning methods for insightful approaches.The backbone of our system is our  Curriculum, which consists of 8 comprehensive learning areas divided into several developmental categories that we want every single child to use in their daily life.  Not only do  we translate our program and content into different languages, but we also change it according to different regions to make it culturally inclusive.We also want to  promote a healthy balance between both the digital and physical world. To create this harmony we encourage every child to use the device to get out of the device and become motivated, independent little learners!  We aim to reach as many children as possible which is why we have translated our learning materials into 22 languages thus far and plan on reaching 50 languages in the long-haul and eventually achieve a worldwide reach.For little ones who need an extra helping-hand, we’ve created a badge to signify which of our learning materials are suitable for children with Special Needs. Because we believe all kids deserve the opportunity to learn and succeed!Our Curriculum Design is already in practice in international schools. In 2013, we opened our own Lipa Preschool where we implement our whole system and get feedback directly from the children, who let us know what they need and want.   Why are we here? A child’s early years play a critical role in predicting their future success. But while 38% of kids around the world can’t read, write, or do math (UNICEF 2016), other kids are spending these early years playing apps that have no educational value.We’re addressing both these issues by creating an app that kids will not only love to play, but that will teach them skills for a better life.Smart devices are exciting to kids and can be delivered to even the most rural areas, giving kids the chance to improve their future while they’re still waiting for schools to be built and teachers to be trained.  What is our solution for children's education? Lipa Land!  Lipa Land's home screen and themes We are currently working on an  all-in-one application, Lipa Land, which is designed for children as well as everyone involved in children’s education and development.With Lipa Land, access to quality education is provided through a system of both digital and physical activities that will send children on an adventure of growth and exploration.The most unique aspect of Lipa Land is how  each game adapts to a child's learning ability and offers parents/caretakers progress tracking along the way.  Child's progress tracking and real-world activities  Lipa Land will enable children to have an individualized experience, thus creating a learning pathway based on their own level and pace of learning.In this app, parents, caretakers and teachers also have a dedicated section where they will have access to daily parenting information and personalized content based on their child’s performance.  Lipa Land's bedtime stories Lipa Land has been carefully evaluated by a team of educational experts who designed the app for a proper balance of digital engagement: a 45 minute session per day for kids, and a 15 minute session for parents. This means kids and parents are only learning directly with the device for 1 hour, while the rest of the activities are completed outside the app.The pilot app is also being tested in 17 international preschools. This way,  kids themselves show us exactly what they need and want from their learning experience and we can inspire them towards an ongoing pursuit of knowledge.  Activities for children

Lipa Land
Lipa Land is nearing the final stage of completion and we need your help bringing it from a prototype to a full product. To continuously create good educational value, we want to  constantly add content to Lipa Land based on the feedback received by users.
Our Curriculum
Research and development for improving our Curriculum is also needed to stay up to date with the evolving environment that children are in.
 Children in Tilonia village in Rajasthan, India learning with Lipa Creating a personalized learning experience
Translation
We need to translate our learning materials and Lipa apps from 22 to 50+ languages, especially to reach children in less privileged communities.
Customization
Not only do we plan on simply translating Lipa Land, but also on customizing it according to the norms and culture in different countries/communities.
   Narrowing educational disparity worldwide
Deployment and distribution
The most challenging step is getting the product to the doorstep of all families worldwide, most of those living in developing regions.
To bring Lipa Land to children worldwide, we need to create partnerships with preschools around the world, app publishers and device manufacturers to pre-install our content on their devices.
We also want to partner with nonprofit organizations that have access to children at the bottom of the pyramid like we are currently doing with  Curious Learning. 
 All of those above steps need to be carried out simultaneously and that is why we need your help! Lipa’s apps reaching children in South Africa with the help of  Curious Learning   Where does your contribution go? Product development

<p><b></b></p><h3><b><b>WHY POP-UP PLAY DAY? </b></b></h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The idea for the Pop-Up Play Day Tour was
sparked when we realized that girls in our after-school programs seldom ride
bikes or play old-fashioned games like hopscotch and Double Dutch. Like so many others, these girls spend more time playing on digital
devices than they do playing outdoors. </p>
<p>We quickly realized that our girls aren’t the
only ones who have stopped playing. In fact, 
Nike’s <a href=""http://www.designedtomove.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Designed to Move”</a> report suggests that physical activity in the U.S. has declined 32% since 1968 and is
on track for a 46% drop by 2030. Consequently, 1 in 3 American girls (that 12.5
million) are overweight and obese. </p>
<p>This must change. To do our part, we researched
the most successful intervention programs in the world to figure out what our
girls are missing. We read a ton of research articles and talked to a lot of
girls...</p><p></p><h1></h1><h3></h3><h4><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><h3><b>Watch Victoria's #PlayLikeAGirl Story </b></h3></span></h4><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mq3LVjDj8J8"" width=""560""></iframe></div><h3>
</h3><p></p><h3></h3><p><b>For instance, we learned that a girl who plays sports also:</b></p><p></p><p></p><ul>
<li><p>Is less likely to get pregnant and engage in risky sexual behavior</p></li>

<li><p>Gains confidence, positive body image, resilience and key leadership skills</p></li>
</ul><p></p><p>Among <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">many other things, we learned that girls need

<h3>Play Like A Girl!®</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What started in 2004 as a few annual events
hosted by sorority girls in Alabama has become the source of inspiration for
several thousand girls and young women across the United States and Canada. At
Play Like A Girl, our mission is to inspire girls everywhere to live happier
and healthier by promoting physical activity as a path to lifelong success. So
we created girl-focused health education programs that make physical activity
accessible, easy and fun. <br/></p><i>Read more about what we, and our partners, are doing

<p><b>We envision a future where girls are running, jumping and kicking to reach their greatest potential. </b></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As a first step in that direction, we are
launching the Pop-Up Play Day Tour — an unprecedented
collaboration to bring play back to America’s most inactive communities, beginning
in the South where the burden of overweight and obesity is greatest. The tour is
designed to provide simple steps and tools to help girls and their families get
back outdoors to play again.</span><br/></p>
<p>The schedule on the Pop-Up Play Day Tour is equal
parts information and fun. We make every effort to deliver a healthy dose of
education and entertainment that keeps girls excited about and committed to active play,
physical activity and sports long after we’ve left their communities.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448317755/ij1xe4dch4qfptyuc01o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Girls of all ages are invited to attend these free events, which offer an entire day of activities and games for girls and their
families, including sports clinics and drills, cheer, dance, and old-school
games, as well as a 5K walk/run, arts and entertainment to encourage active and
healthy lifestyles.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We will make 10 stops across the South, kicking off Memorial
Day weekend with stops in new cities every 2-3 weeks until Labor Day 2016 (tentative list by state below). Exact location in each state is TBD with our nonprofit and educational
partners who will help kids warm up for Pop-Up Play Day by hosting pre-event
activities and training for teachers, parents and

bikes or play old-fashioned games like hopscotch and Double Dutch. Like so many others, these girls spend more time playing on digital
devices than they do playing outdoors. 
We quickly realized that our girls aren’t the
only ones who have stopped playing. In fact, 
Nike’s “Designed to Move” report suggests that physical activity in the U.S. has declined 32% since 1968 and is
on track for a 46% drop by 2030. Consequently, 1 in 3 American girls (that 12.5
million) are overweight and obese. 
This must change. To do our part, we researched
the most successful intervention programs in the world to figure out what our
girls are missing. We read a ton of research articles and talked to a lot of
girls...Watch Victoria's #PlayLikeAGirl Story 
For instance, we learned that a girl who plays sports also:
Is less likely to get pregnant and engage in risky sexual behavior
Has reduced risk of breast cancer, heart disease and other chronic illnesses
Gains confidence, positive body image, resilience and key leadership skills
Among many other things, we learned that girls need
a daily ritual of play: an established pattern of getting outside and playing
every day. So we decided to bring back play by delivering early, positive
experiences for girls in active play, physical activity and sports. Your donation makes this possible for more girls. Donate here.
Play Like A Girl!®

What started in 2004 as a few annual events
hosted by sorority girls in Alabama has become the source of inspiration for
several thousand girls and young women across the United States and Canada. At
Play Like A Girl, our mission is to inspire girls everywhere to live happier
and healthier by promoting physical activity as a path to lifelong success. So
we created girl-focused health education programs that make physical activity
accessible, easy and fun. Read more about what we, and our partners, are doing
to bring back play here.
A LOOK INSIDE POP-UP PLAY DAY 




We envision a future where girls are running, jumping and kicking to reach their greatest potential. As a first step in that direction, we are
launching the Pop-Up Play Day Tour — an unprecedented
collaboration to bring play back to America’s most inactive communities, beginning
in the South where the burden of overweight and obesity is greatest. The tour is
designed to provide simple steps and tools to help girls and their families get
back outdoors to play again.
The schedule on the Pop-Up Play Day Tour is equal
parts information and fun. We make every effort to deliver a healthy dose of
education and entertainment that keeps girls excited about and committed to active play,
physical activity and sports long after we’ve left their communities.
Girls of all ages are invited to attend these free events, which offer an entire day of activities and games for girls and their
families, including sports clinics and drills, cheer, dance, and old-school
games, as well as a 5K walk/run, arts and entertainment to encourage active and
healthy lifestyles.We will make 10 stops across the South, kicking off Memorial
Day weekend with stops in new cities every 2-3 weeks until Labor Day 2016 (tentative list by state below). Exact location in each state is TBD with our nonprofit and educational
partners who will help kids warm up for Pop-Up Play Day by hosting pre-event
activities and training for teachers, parents and
administrators at dozens of schools and recreational centers
in tour cities.Alabama   ✪  Arkansas   ✪  Florida   ✪  Georgia   ✪  Louisiana   ✪  Mississippi 
✪  North Carolina   ✪  South Carolina   ✪  Tennessee   ✪  Texas 
Hear Isa's story. She likes to #PlayLikeAGirl too.
The first and final stops will also feature a concert with popular artists from Hip Hop Public Health and the Partnership for a Healthier America. Contributing artists
include legendary rap icons Doug E. Fresh, VP of Entertainment for Hip Hop
Public Health, and DMC of Run DMC. Other artists include Jordin Sparks,
Matisyahu, Travis Barker, Ryan Beatty, Ashanti, Ariana Grande, Paul Burch and
Brady Rymer among others.

In addition, there will be opportunities
for schools to apply for grants like the GO! Grant
that support physical activity before, during and after school. Schools will be
given free access to GoNoodle and
Hip Hop Public Health's digital platforms for incorporation into existing
curricula. And, teachers will be offered SPARK
teacher training aimed at integrating physical activity/education in the
classroom. Plus, girls who attend will also access online tools, enter to win a
box of free play equipment, and take home a free KIDS in the GAME PASS
to cover up to $50 in pay-to-play registration fees for recreational
sports. 
We can't imagine a future for girls without play! 
Our big dream is to help every girl we can lace up and get outside to enjoy the timeless pleasures of outdoor play, physical activity and sports. With your contribution, the possibilities for this generation’s girls are endless. 
#GivingTuesday is just around the corner, but perks are available now. Click here to give the gift of play to girls in your community. 
We Need Your Help!
Our goal is to bring back play to 10,000 girls in 2016. This means supporters (you!) backing us today on Indiegogo to
make the Pop-Up Play Day Tour happen. Sharing stories, online and in-person, using fun and inspiring pics of girls from our
gallery to help spread the word. Purchasing gear in our e-store to support our stops. Giving time or donations to
start local Play Like A Girl councils. Doing good, spreading love! This is going to take some serious
cash. More than $250,000 to be exact. Our initial $50,000 Indiegogo goal will be
offset by corporate sponsorships and the in-kind donations of our partners. The
more we raise together on Indiegogo, the less we have to rely on outside
investments. 

It takes a village, people...LET’S
DO THIS!

<p>Cavalcade of Authors West is in its second year, modeled after the Cavalcade of Authors established in the Tri Cities of Washington in 2009. In our first year, we saw 250 students working in an intimate setting of a 15:1 ratio with award-winning, popular young adult authors from around the country.

Above all, we all have a passion for students, authors and literacy; this conference will allow us to combine all of those pieces to deliver a unique and meaningful experience to the students of our own community.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To operate a program of this magnitude for our students, we are looking to raise nearly $18,000. To reach as many students and schools as possible, donations of any value are welcome and appreciated.</p>
<p>The funds will go directly to pay author honorariums, travel and lodging expenses, and meals, as well as for marketing and school outreach. We have worked hard to negotiate discounts and donations when possible; for instance, conference fees have been donated by PLU and many authors are donating travel expenses and autographed books.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are committed to promoting literacy in our community. We want to pass on the love for books in our world that is slowly beginning to devalue the wonder of reading. As educators, we know that reading is the number one indicator of student success in school and in determining their earning power in the workplace. The Cavalcade of Authors West is the experience of a lifetime for students, bringing together world-class authors and their young adult readers.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know you have a number of options to support student education and literacy projects. Cavalcade of Authors West is not a festival, it is not a convention, but is unique in that we offer workshops in a intimate classroom setting with world-renowned authors. We are the first event of this kind in the Puget Sound. In our second year, we are confident in the continued success of this project. Our biggest challenge is having the money to support our commitments to both authors and students. We will continue to reach out to our corporate community as partners in this project, but we need to count on our friends and supporters to continue this unique program.</p>

We are Walnut St. Labs. We're an ""innovation lab"" -- that's a fancy pants way of saying we cultivate innovation in our community. We're in West Chester, PA. This is the way we do it: 

We raise awareness of innovation. Sometimes that means inviting a local innovator or entrepreneur to come in and talk about his/her company or by doing a round-table on a new technology like Oculus Rift, Go, Particle.io or...
Then we get people to experience innovation first hand. We do this a few different ways: it could be at one of our 3D Printer Bootcamps or the time those guys came in with Oculus Rifts!
Then we get out of the way and let stuff happen! And having a clubhouse is key. First it was Clay and Brandon making a new Twitter app in like 6 weeks. Then it was Peter throwing down the gauntlet and becoming a developer with the help of a bunch of Night Owls and crushing dev on his new calendar app, and then it was...

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

WHAT WE NEED AND WHY WE NEED IT
We don't charge for events. And the speakers and professionals donating their time don't get paid. But our team has spent thousands of hours running them and creating videos and distributing content about them... With financial support we can ensure we can keep doing them into 2016.

WHAT YOU GET


""An Innovation Lab In Every Community!"" That's our motto. We are quite frankly knocked over, on the ground, stunned by what this community of innovators has done in just under 2 years. There's a hunger for innovation. The ""clubhouse"" is where it all starts. 
But to be concrete, by contributing to this campaign you will:

Create more exposure for cutting edge technology
Create free education
Create opportunity to collaborate -- and to work
Create inspiration
Create community
Create IMPACT!

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>We call our Makerspace Invention Dimension and we exist to teach children:</strong></p>
<p>- to become resilient in the face of challenges- to have grit<br/>- to effectively problem-solve and collaborate<br/>- to bolster critical thinking and logic skills</p>
<p><strong>We offer an inclusive space where children can learn through hands-on academic and social skill building- called ‘making’.  </strong></p>
<p>With ‘making’ children:<br/>- develop character and a sense of purpose, <br/>- tend to persevere<br/>- think creatively <br/>- and grow up to be independent, thoughtful problem solvers.</p>
<p>We want to stay open in order to serve as many children as possible. We really see the research-based benefit of making and want to ensure children receive these life-long benefits in a fun and engaging way. </p>
<h3>How this all started</h3>
<p>HI- My name is Laurie Bloyer, and I am a former classroom teacher turned, Makerspace creator. I moved from the classroom to the Makerspace to give children of all abilities a place to be exceptional.</p>
<p>I fell in love with 'making' when I was researching project-based learning ideas for my classroom. realizing that there was not much time in the day for 'making' I started an after-school club, where we doubled in size to over 40 makers in 2 weeks. All of the makers stayed with the club and we culminated our year in the only MAKE: Magazine branded School Maker Faire in New Mexico. At this same time I was starting our Makerspace in central Abq. I am thrilled that my job now has become a place where I teach vital life skills such as perseverance, critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, grit, cooperation, STEAM skills and so much more- and we get to do it through hands-on activities. How fun! (Interestingly enough these are the top requested skills employers are/and will be looking for - see the World Economic Forum graphic below)</p>
<p>I am seeking your help in order to get the word out about the advantage of making to the families of Abq. I want to educate them as to what is making and why is it so vital for their child to learn. Additionally, I am looking for support to keep our Makerspace running. Thus far, I have used my own savings and loans to pay for this space, but I see I need more time to launch it off the ground, and I don't want to give up yet! I am creating this space for OUR future, to ensure that children have the opportunity for a sure foundation, and to ensure this Makerspace will be here to teach vital life skills and prepare our children for the future, and I need help. (Also of interest- Abq is ON THE VERGE of embracing making big time- a press release JUST announced that the US Dept. Of Education is awarding $7.8 Million to...”schools where students will engage in hands-on, integrated Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics learning experiences.” (<a href=""http://www.aps.edu/news/aps-gets-7-8m-grant-for-north-valley-stem-schools"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.aps.edu/news/aps-gets-7-8m-grant-for...</a>) As you can see we are on to something here!</p>
<p>Your contributions will help spread the word through maker activities, events, marketing about the value of making and about research. This research has proven that the act of tinkering, making, and creating has shown a resurgence in children's desire to learn, that they are better prepared for the workforce, and how children are becoming our next innovators- taking ideas into reality- bettering our society, and our world! By contributing you will help to keep the door open for about 6 months. It is my plan to be self sustaining after this time.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $12,500 to start. Fortunately, we really don't need a lot to keep our doors open! $2,000/month pays for rent, utilities, some supplies, and our marketing. This is only to keep the doors open, and to market the Makerspace. In the future I would love to be able to offer scholarships. My plan is to pay for salaries with enrollment fees.</p>
<p>We are offering great maker perks. (of course!) There will be drawings from one of the makers, and from our ever so popular take apart stations we have jewelry like no other you have seen! Also, inspired by our cardboard challenge we have very unique earrings. Check them all out on the right. ---&gt;</p>
<p>We will also have surprise perks for early donors as well as perks coming throughout the campaign.</p>
<p>If our goal is not reached...we wont cry (too much), we will be eternally thankful and will use what we have been given to extend the time we can keep the space and pay for advertising.  We appreciate any and all help we are able to receive!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>“The benefits of educational Makerspaces are many and varied. Makerspaces can have a significant impact on student learning and development. In fact, Makerspaces were recently identified as one of six important developments in educational technology for K-12 education by the <strong><a href=""http://cdn.nmc.org/media/2015-nmc-horizon-report-k12-EN.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New Media Consortium (NMC) Horizon Report for 2015</a></strong>, which states, “Makerspaces are increasingly being looked to as a method for engaging learners in creative, higher-order problem-solving through hands-on design, construction, and iteration” (p. 38). According to the<strong> <a href=""http://www.nmc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NMC </a></strong>(2015), Makerspaces have the potential to effectively address the necessary skillsets for students in the 21st Century (p. 38). What follows is an explanation of some of the potential benefits that can be gained through maker learning and well established Makerspaces. *</p>
<p>Makerspaces spark the brain boost that comes from using one’s hands. Research by psychologists Robert and Michele Root Bernstein indicates that tinkerers are thinkers. Arts and crafts—aka, making—develop such skills as observing, visual thinking, and pattern recognition. They develop habits that include practicing, persevering, and trial-and-error problem solving. The common denominator among many noted scientists, including Einstein, is that hand-based hobbies figured significantly into their personal histories. Making and tinkering expand intellect because a disproportionately large part of the brain’s somatosensory cortex is connected to the hands. Studies show that kids who take notes by hand absorb the lecture material in a deeper way. As philosopher Anaxagoras said, “The hand is the window to the mind.”</p>
<p>Studies also show that one key to success is creating an environment that fosters intrinsic motivation. When passion, rather than compliance, drives the task, success is more likely. Inborn talent or a drive to master a shortcoming might determine the choice of a project. Makerspaces are ideal for</p>
<p>They break the habit of wastefulness. One of the perks of making is that by repurposing what’s readily available, we conjure a sense of resourcefulness, creativity, and empowerment. My father-in-law once said, “I love to take some old broken thing and see what I can do with it.” Combining old elements to bring something new into being is psychologist Rollo May’s definition of creativity. Patrons can bring in broken objects, material fragments, abandoned toys, etc. One person’s junk is another’s treasure, after all.”**</p>

<h3>And finally….</h3>
<p>THANK YOU! Words can’t express enough how much this means to me and the children and families who will benefit from this Makerspace.</p>

We call our Makerspace Invention Dimension and we exist to teach children:
- to become resilient in the face of challenges- to have grit- to effectively problem-solve and collaborate- to bolster critical thinking and logic skills
We offer an inclusive space where children can learn through hands-on academic and social skill building- called ‘making’.  
With ‘making’ children:- develop character and a sense of purpose, - tend to persevere- think creatively - and grow up to be independent, thoughtful problem solvers.
We want to stay open in order to serve as many children as possible. We really see the research-based benefit of making and want to ensure children receive these life-long benefits in a fun and engaging way. 
How this all started
HI- My name is Laurie Bloyer, and I am a former classroom teacher turned, Makerspace creator. I moved from the classroom to the Makerspace to give children of all abilities a place to be exceptional.
I fell in love with 'making' when I was researching project-based learning ideas for my classroom. realizing that there was not much time in the day for 'making' I started an after-school club, where we doubled in size to over 40 makers in 2 weeks. All of the makers stayed with the club and we culminated our year in the only MAKE: Magazine branded School Maker Faire in New Mexico. At this same time I was starting our Makerspace in central Abq. I am thrilled that my job now has become a place where I teach vital life skills such as perseverance, critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, grit, cooperation, STEAM skills and so much more- and we get to do it through hands-on activities. How fun! (Interestingly enough these are the top requested skills employers are/and will be looking for - see the World Economic Forum graphic below)
I am seeking your help in order to get the word out about the advantage of making to the families of Abq. I want to educate them as to what is making and why is it so vital for their child to learn. Additionally, I am looking for support to keep our Makerspace running. Thus far, I have used my own savings and loans to pay for this space, but I see I need more time to launch it off the ground, and I don't want to give up yet! I am creating this space for OUR future, to ensure that children have the opportunity for a sure foundation, and to ensure this Makerspace will be here to teach vital life skills and prepare our children for the future, and I need help. (Also of interest- Abq is ON THE VERGE of embracing making big time- a press release JUST announced that the US Dept. Of Education is awarding $7.8 Million to...”schools where students will engage in hands-on, integrated Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics learning experiences.” (http://www.aps.edu/news/aps-gets-7-8m-grant-for...) As you can see we are on to something here!
Your contributions will help spread the word through maker activities, events, marketing about the value of making and about research. This research has proven that the act of tinkering, making, and creating has shown a resurgence in children's desire to learn, that they are better prepared for the workforce, and how children are becoming our next innovators- taking ideas into reality- bettering our society, and our world! By contributing you will help to keep the door open for about 6 months. It is my plan to be self sustaining after this time.
What We Need & What You Get
We need $12,500 to start. Fortunately, we really don't need a lot to keep our doors open! $2,000/month pays for rent, utilities, some supplies, and our marketing. This is only to keep the doors open, and to market the Makerspace. In the future I would love to be able to offer scholarships. My plan is to pay for salaries with enrollment fees.
We are offering great maker perks. (of course!) There will be drawings from one of the makers, and from our ever so popular take apart stations we have jewelry like no other you have seen! Also, inspired by our cardboard challenge we have very unique earrings. Check them all out on the right. --->
We will also have surprise perks for early donors as well as perks coming throughout the campaign.
If our goal is not reached...we wont cry (too much), we will be eternally thankful and will use what we have been given to extend the time we can keep the space and pay for advertising.  We appreciate any and all help we are able to receive!
The Impact
“The benefits of educational Makerspaces are many and varied. Makerspaces can have a significant impact on student learning and development. In fact, Makerspaces were recently identified as one of six important developments in educational technology for K-12 education by the New Media Consortium (NMC) Horizon Report for 2015, which states, “Makerspaces are increasingly being looked to as a method for engaging learners in creative, higher-order problem-solving through hands-on design, construction, and iteration” (p. 38). According to the NMC (2015), Makerspaces have the potential to effectively address the necessary skillsets for students in the 21st Century (p. 38). What follows is an explanation of some of the potential benefits that can be gained through maker learning and well established Makerspaces. *
Makerspaces spark the brain boost that comes from using one’s hands. Research by psychologists Robert and Michele Root Bernstein indicates that tinkerers are thinkers. Arts and crafts—aka, making—develop such skills as observing, visual thinking, and pattern recognition. They develop habits that include practicing, persevering, and trial-and-error problem solving. The common denominator among many noted scientists, including Einstein, is that hand-based hobbies figured significantly into their personal histories. Making and tinkering expand intellect because a disproportionately large part of the brain’s somatosensory cortex is connected to the hands. Studies show that kids who take notes by hand absorb the lecture material in a deeper way. As philosopher Anaxagoras said, “The hand is the window to the mind.”
Studies also show that one key to success is creating an environment that fosters intrinsic motivation. When passion, rather than compliance, drives the task, success is more likely. Inborn talent or a drive to master a shortcoming might determine the choice of a project. Makerspaces are ideal for
They break the habit of wastefulness. One of the perks of making is that by repurposing what’s readily available, we conjure a sense of resourcefulness, creativity, and empowerment. My father-in-law once said, “I love to take some old broken thing and see what I can do with it.” Combining old elements to bring something new into being is psychologist Rollo May’s definition of creativity. Patrons can bring in broken objects, material fragments, abandoned toys, etc. One person’s junk is another’s treasure, after all.”**

I am 30 years old, married with Panagiota and father of a beautiful boy who is 3 years old.I come from a small village called Fylakio belonging to the prefecture of Evros near of the banks of the River Ardas. It is inhabited by about 500 people who are mainly engaged in the cultivation of the earth.I work as a farmer with my family which is engaged in the cultivation of land about 50 years. Our main crops are corn, wheat, sunflowers and small amounts of beet and potatoes.What is Zea?Zea is probably the oldest cereal of this world and 
stood for a key component in the diet of Ancient Greeks. It features an 
undeniable nutritional value and it is no coincidence that the etymology
 of the ancient Greek word “ζείδωρος” (zeidoros) meaning  life giving” comes from this particular cereal.

Zea’s scientific name is “Triticum dicoccum” and although it externally 
looks similar to wheat, it has a different nutritional composition. It 
is largely referred to as Zeia, Spelt and Emmer, but it shouldn’t 
however be confused with the German Dinkel or rye.Zea is highly nutritious and contains important nutrients, which make it superior to other cereals. Zea is two times richer in dietary fiber, in comparison with other wheat, a fact that makes it a good choice for people suffering from diabetes.In addition, Zea is two times richer in protein and features a high content of the amino acid lysine and vitamins A, B, C and E.
 Lysine is that particular component of proteins that increases their 
digestibility, boosts the immune system and it’s a key element for the 
brain’s biochemical functioning.Another key advantage of Zea is its high content in magnesium, up to 40% higher in comparison with other cereals. Zea is also very low in gluten, a fact that makes it highly digestible.The cultivation of Zea seems to go back 
for more than 12,000 years, as revealed by excavations in prehistoric 
settlements throughout Greece, and according to historical texts, Alexander the Great’s soldiers would eat Zea, in order to remain strong and healthy.
It seems that Zea’s production was so widespread in antiquity that it is possible that the Port of Zea in Pireus took its name from this cereal because of the related increased trafficking and transactions that took place there.Until about a century ago, Zea was one of the most popular wheat in 
Greece, but over the years it seems that more economically profitable 
cereal crops such as rice or wheat prevailed.The year 1928 and progressively banned until 1932 completely abolished the cultivation of Zea in Greece. Indeed until the dictionaries “disappeared” the term Zea! Only in the dictionary “Helios” is a relative description, the later mostly dictionaries the word is analyzed as a feed! Followed by the cultivation of wheat mutant, the purpose of this operation what else? The stupefaction of the Greeks. As one researcher has said in England in the mutant cause shrinkage of the brain in animals.What We Need 1.500.000 USD is what we need to start our business.Τhe money needed to be invested in the purchase of equipment as below:

Τractor supply and various machines for it.

Combine harvester supply.
Processing laboratory creation of Zea flour.
Construction drier for drying of Zea.
 Trucksupply for the transportation of Zea from the field to drying.
Job CreationThe jobs that will be created through our project will amount to 13 and adressed to the villagers.They will be a huge help as the economic crisis in Greece has deprived many people their job, forcing them to live through poverty.Why you should help us?The crisis generates ideas and oppurtunities.With our idea, we have the opportunity to prove that we are not lazy Greeks, that we want to have the right to work an we can share with the world the treasures of the Greek land.With the Greek goverment absent from innovative ideas this is too difficult.            For this reason we are asking for your help.Are all this feasible?Yes!Funding can really help us because it's just a case of getting on and doing it.What you get

<p>I've taught and facilitated meditation groups for several years but 
took the past two years to focus on family and to deepen my own personal
 meditation practices.  And now it's time to rebuild and open a 
meditation centre, one that is accessible online with daily live stream 
classes and a catalogue of pre-recorded guided meditations.</p>
<p>Sort of an online ashram, if you will. <br/></p>
<p> A perfect solution for busy 
people who want the zen life.  Simply log on, tune in, and attend your 
class within your very own online meditation community.<br/></p>
<p>A little about me... I've studied meditation for the past decade and a half (in its so many forms)  and have been featured in news articles because of my interests and work in meditation, as well as appearances on television.  Recently in Calgary, I was given the opportunity to present  meditation seminars at the public school boards staff convention.   <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need $ 15,000 to get this project going.  Much of this (approximately $7,000.00) is needed to build a fully interactive membership site where daily scheduled meditation groups and classes are live streamed with unlimited access for members.  There will be regular live streamed meditation groups daily for an individual to participate in, truly becoming part of our meditation community.<br/></p>
<p>The rest of the contributions will be used to secure and maintain a meditation centre location in Calgary where the classes and groups can be facilitated for the website.  This centre will be available to members in the area who prefer to attend live classes instead of logging in through the online meditation centre located in SW Calgary.<br/></p>

<br/>
<p>With your pre-purchase of a membership for either the online or brick and mortar centre, you can help make this dream a reality!   A perfect solution for those ready to start a dedicated meditation practice but who need the support, encouragement and disciplined schedule to make it happen.  </p>
<p>If only a  portion of the $ 15,000 is raised, the online centre and the Calgary location will still happen with a May 2016 launch.  Just on a smaller scale and with a humble beginning.  :)</p>
<p>The Centre, both location and online, will hold up to 80+ meditation based classes and groups every month.  These classes will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily Zen meditation groups from 6:30 - 7:30 am M-F</li>
<li>Kinhin meditation every other day</li>
<li>Afternoon classes and groups using a variety of guided meditations, such as, self healing, zero point energy, merkaba, pranic, and 61 point to name just a few.  <br/>
</li>
<li>Emotional transmutation <br/>
</li>
<li>Vapassana</li>
<li>Pranayama<br/>
</li>
<li>Meditation over Medication <br/>
</li>
<li>Power of Mind<br/>
</li>
<li>LGBTQ Zen - Evenings for like minded individuals of the lgbtq community to meet and meditate.</li>
<li>Kuji In <br/>
</li>
<li>Chant groups - mantra meditation</li>
<li>Qi Gong</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a small sample of groups and classes that will be available.<br/></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>The online memberships will have the same access to all classes and groups as the location members.  There will be a live feed for each event, with a forum for people to get to know each other.  Also, Q&amp;A and discussion after each class which includes our online members will further bring our Zen community together.<br/></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>The centre will be open 7 days a week with some evenings, giving members the flexibility they need to tailor make a meditation schedule that fits them.   If an individual is interested in developing a meditation practice and will be practicing more than twice a week, Zen is the perfect solution to overcoming any obstacles that may be present in fulfilling this.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Having an online meditation centre, as well as, a local centre is essential in growing our meditation community worldwide.  It creates a unique and welcoming place for people to meet and develop a sustainable meditation practice to grow and evolve as a group.  While a physical location certainly fills the need of many who enjoy and value personal growth, individuals who are unable to attend a physical location miss out on the aspect of a community of like minded people and growing within it, together.   <br/></p>
<p>I have facilitated meditation groups for several years.  Some of these were, for a period of a few months, in remote areas that were unable to access meditation groups and simply relied on youtube or bought guided meditations.   While these are wonderful resources to have, there was no comparison in coming together to help and nurture each other in our personal evolution.  While I did have to eventually move, many individuals within those groups were able to develop a solid foundation for a continued meditation practice and kept up their gatherings.  There are people all over the world who need this type of support to get themselves going on a path of personal inward success.  An online community provides this for many, whether they live in remote areas, are disabled, elderly, have children or a crazy work schedule that simply makes it impossible to attend a group meditation.  And offering a live stream access point to gather is the perfect space to develop this sense of belonging and community.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Building a community like this requires commitment, dedication and persistence.  Am I up to this challenge?  Absolutely!  I have given much thought and consideration to this over the course of the past year and I am ready to dedicate myself to the centre.  Early mornings?  No problem!  Long days?  Got it covered!  <br/></p>
<p> It also requires continued support through the purchase of memberships.  This will require continued marketing.  It will also require accessibility to the centre to keep interest and momentum going, to make a membership really worth having.  <br/></p>
<p>As the Zen centre and it's community grows, it will enable us to offer a greater variety of services to our members, more classes and groups from a number of instructors and regular and longer hours.</p>

With your generous help, we can make student success every student’s reality.What Our Students Say""Student Success U provides students with the necessary tools needed to successfully stand out. I was able to take strategies right away and use them to further my job preparation upon graduation.""-​Christina Diecidue | Rider University Class of 2016 | Sr. Class President ​""When I went through the platform, all I could think was why didn’t I have this when I was getting started. SSU helped me finalize some key things for my new profession following graduation.""​-Michelle Knoeppel | Penn State High Honors Grad 2014 | #1 STEM ​""When I started using the SSU platform I realized quickly how much really goes into a job search. From how I can use tech platforms to how I connected with people in my field with their strategies, the process that SSU took me through I would recommend that all students go through it. For me it was eye opening what it takes to get a job today.""-​Colin Murray | Marist College Class of 2014 | 2-year ROTC | Criminal Justice ""The earlier you do it the less money and time you will have wasted and the more ahead of the pack you will be.""-Victoria Slinger | Monmouth University Class of 2015 | Honors ​""SSU is true real world preparation for whatever the world has in store. Their program and strategies really put my ideas, interests, and personal brand in order with a solid foundation that I can build on; that any student can build on.""-​Dan Malafronte | Brookdale Community College Class of 2017 ""Working with TJ and SSU helped me build the confidence to start my own empire. SSU is a platform that any student in any major can highly benefit from. We all need to know how to market ourselves for sure.""-Jessica Gannon | Wilkes College Graduate | NCAA Student AthleteRisks & ChallengesWhile all startups have risks, we have done our best to mitigate these by extensively validating the market. We did this by speaking with hundreds of recent post grads, current college students, hiring managers, professors, university administrators, and – most of all, you – moms and dads. We’ve taken all that – and combined with our experience – molded it into a clear, step-by-step process that will help students where they need it most.  There is very little risk in terms of us failing to deliver product or services. The first season of our podcast launched Sept. 27th on iTunes, our platform is in development and beta testing, and our first student ambassadors are already taking their campuses by storm. The only missing ingredient is moms and dads like you.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you’ve already made a commitment, thank you! If you'd like to help us spread our mission even more, there are a few ways you can do so. Start with one or two people you think this would be relevant for and share the link.Then, subscribe to The Student Success Podcast on Apple Podcasts (iTunes), Stitcher, and Google Play.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Imagine waking up in a world where you don't know who your local Mayor is...in fact imagine a world where you don't know who most of your locally elected officials are. That is the world that most Americans live in today. Through Politicking we are able to create transparency between candidate and constituent by demystifying the way users have been traditionally informed about politics.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Politicking is important because millennials represent the second largest generation of this country's electorate, without our votes we willingly allow America's politics to engage in business as usual. In the most recent 2018 elections only 31% of millennials turned out. Surveys say that millennials feel politically disengaged, apathetic and unclear about candidate positions and local issues that are up for referendum. </li>
<li>Politicking solves these issues by providing this information in a way our peers are accustomed to receiving it-- through their mobile devices. </li>
</ul>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>But we can't do this without your help:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are looking to raise <strong>$200,000 dollars </strong>to get this product to market before the 2020 elections. Every single dollar counts so we can bring Politicking to YOUR local city. </li>
<li>In fact the more people donate in your region, the more counties we can cover in that region. So be sure to REPRESENT. </li>
<li>One thing that seems to affect founders of color disproportionately is that oftentimes they can receive a round of applause from their communities, but not a round of funding. We believe we can break that mold TODAY. The funds for Politicking will help with the scalability of our product, UI/UX design, marketing, API development, big data and building a team.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every single dollar contributed to the Politicking campaign will be spent to bring this project to life. </p>
<ul><li>We are a NON-PARTISAN organization that if more concerned with ensuring that people get out in make an educated and informed vote. We are less concerned about WHO they vote for. </li></ul>

<h3>About the Founders</h3>
<p>My name is Wen-kuni Ceant and in 2016, my co-founder Jordan Wilson and I decided to come up with a solution to an issue that challenged Americans throughout the country...by reimagining the way users interface with information about local, state and national candidates, their platforms and the infamous amendments and referendums that confuse us all.</p>
<p>We met at Howard University in 2014. After becoming close friends, we sought out to tackle bigger issues...like dismantling the high rates of voter oppression/illiteracy within their communities.</p>
<p>Our Credentials speak for themselves: I am a Fulbright Scholar that attended both Howard and Drexel University for her Bachelors and Masters degrees respectively and Jordan Wilson is a law school bound Public Service Scholar at Harvard College, where she oversees civic engagement initiatives including the Harvard Votes Challenge that have well prepared us both for the challenges that we will encounter in building Politicking.</p>

<p><b>This is what we'll do with your help:</b></p>
<p><b>-Solar Panels for a 5 kwH capacity</b>, totaling the school’s energy bill.</p>
<p>We will install a solar panel array that will cover the total energy bill for Instituto Kino’s elementary school. This will allow the kids to know first hand the world and concepts of renewable energies. At the same time it has a direct financial impact for the institution. Total savings of over $24,000 pesos a year</p>
<p><b>-Solar Water Heaters </b>for the total boiler capacity of the place.</p>
<p>We will install solar water heaters, replacing the current total capacity installed in boilers (gas) to supply with hot water to the kitchen, restrooms and dorms. This will have a financial impact for the institution and exposes the kids to different technologies and introduces a culture of respect for natural resources. Total Savings of 380 Kg  of LP Gas. </p>
<p><b>-School Farm</b> using permaculture  </p>
<p>We will build a school farm, totaling &gt;75 m2 using the scope of permaculture. We will also host a series of talks, and workshop, provided by our friends of “Color Tierra, AC”, who are experts in this matter. With their help we will create conscience, educate and bring to the diversity in the kids education. The goal of this Farm is to eventually be used for self-consumption. </p>
<p><b>-Robotics</b></p>
<p>We will buy 5 robotic kits, and with the help of our friends at Nearsoft, through their “NS community” initiative, we will help finding and training educators so they can continue facilitating the course for future generations. We want to bring diversity and quality to the kids education, to train them in relevant skills for an ever changing &amp; competitive job market. </p>
<p><b>-Artistic murals.</b></p>
<p>To beautify the school. We are looking to promote artistic activities in the school and hopefully within the curricula. </p>
<p>All of this we can achieve with a budget of $25,000 USD, if  you help us achieve this goal, the institution is going to see the benefits right away, and they will last for long!!</p>
<p>In addition to that we are looking to promote workshops and courses in the following:</p>
<p>-Robotics</p>
<p>-Introduction to Sustainability</p>
<p>-Introduction to Renewable Energies.</p>

Operación Kino
We want to change the lives of over 100 kids a year that are in difficult social situation, by improving the capabilities of the institution that hosts them. 
“Operación Kino” in a strategic action plan devised to completely change the current situation of “Instituto Kino”, which for more than 50 years has been devoted to give house, food and education, but above all, a dignified & humanistic education to hundreds of kids per year that are in abanodonment  and other difficult situations. 
With your help we want to improve the conditions of the place and most importantly, to improve the education: We want to introduce them to robotics & permaculture, to show them first hand the world of clean energies and sustainable development, and hoping to light an interest in arts & culture.
We want to help Instituto Kino to be able to foster and  educate kids that in the future will have a better chance at a competitive job, introducing them to new technologies, new ideas. While we do all this, we will be reducing the operation costs of the place, allowing for expenses & investment in what truly matter: the kids well being.

What are we doing?
This is what we'll do with your help:
-Solar Panels for a 5 kwH capacity, totaling the school’s energy bill.
We will install a solar panel array that will cover the total energy bill for Instituto Kino’s elementary school. This will allow the kids to know first hand the world and concepts of renewable energies. At the same time it has a direct financial impact for the institution. Total savings of over $24,000 pesos a year
-Solar Water Heaters for the total boiler capacity of the place.
We will install solar water heaters, replacing the current total capacity installed in boilers (gas) to supply with hot water to the kitchen, restrooms and dorms. This will have a financial impact for the institution and exposes the kids to different technologies and introduces a culture of respect for natural resources. Total Savings of 380 Kg  of LP Gas. 
-School Farm using permaculture  
We will build a school farm, totaling >75 m2 using the scope of permaculture. We will also host a series of talks, and workshop, provided by our friends of “Color Tierra, AC”, who are experts in this matter. With their help we will create conscience, educate and bring to the diversity in the kids education. The goal of this Farm is to eventually be used for self-consumption. 
-Robotics
We will buy 5 robotic kits, and with the help of our friends at Nearsoft, through their “NS community” initiative, we will help finding and training educators so they can continue facilitating the course for future generations. We want to bring diversity and quality to the kids education, to train them in relevant skills for an ever changing & competitive job market. 
-Artistic murals.
To beautify the school. We are looking to promote artistic activities in the school and hopefully within the curricula. 
All of this we can achieve with a budget of $25,000 USD, if  you help us achieve this goal, the institution is going to see the benefits right away, and they will last for long!!
In addition to that we are looking to promote workshops and courses in the following:
-Robotics
-Introduction to Sustainability
-Introduction to Renewable Energies.
-Permaculture
About the project
The Project:
“Operación Kino” is a plan that involves an extensive team and some very talented individuals that believe in the cause and decided to take part, the plan is developed and taken into action by:
-Luis Ernesto Ortiz Encinas, Bachelor in Finances and Specialist in Sustainable Development
-Omar Acosta Sanchez, Mechatronics Engineer and also Specialist in Sustainable Development.
We share an special interest in Instituto Kino: Our parents were helped by this institution when they were foreign students with minimum resources many years ago in this very same city. Today we are looking to help Instituto Kino to continue with their labor and improve the kids chances of making their way in life. We hope for a better future for many families.
This project stems from our concern of contributing and helping solve some of the needs of the Institution, being these many, and very diverse, we decided to focus on actions for the Sustainability of the place, and the improving of the kids education and thus making a positive impact in this kids future.
We are looking to reduce operational costs so that the institute can focus their efforts in expenses and investments that look for what’s really important: the education, care, and future of the kids that inhabit the place. 
THIS IS NO SMALL PROJECT, That's why we are doing it.
We believe that the best way to change the world is actively working for it. 
Operation Kino consists of 5 actions that will make a deep & meaningful impact in the lives of the kids currently living in this place. At the same time we look to improve it’s capacities, capabilities & overall operational efficiency.

<p>Those following us in Facebook or
visitors to the Exposition know the problems that we had placing signs on the
location in downtown San Antonio. The Shroud of Turin Exposition is located in
a historic building right across City Hall and behind the Cathedral of San
Fernando, the oldest running Cathedral in the United States. The address is 416
Dolorosa St. The name of the street, which in Spanish means “the way of the pain”,
is the street from where Easter processions approached the Cathedral. What can be
more fitting than a large image of the “Man of the Shroud” during lent and
Easter on Dolorosa Street?</p>
<p>Any historic building needs a permit
to place a sign of any kind. We had our share of ups and downs (and fines) getting
the permits to have the limited signage that we currently have. This is a call
of action to help us go BIG and go beyond administrative rules and regulations.
The Shroud of Turin event is temporarily located in San Antonio, and it breaks
our hearts when people coming as far as Houston, El Paso or Laredo cannot find
the location due to the lack of signage. Our heart goes to the elderly or
families with children that walk around downtown looking for us and most of the
times have to call us for help finding the Expo. </p>
<p>The Shroud of Turin Expo has
requested a special permit from the Office of Historic Preservation to place the
largest possible sign on an existing signage frame structure at the building
currently unused. The signs will be facing both sides of the street. It will be
two different signs, one for each direction. The hearing date with the
commission is February 18 at 3:00 pm.</p>
<p>The Shroud of Turin Expo will raffle
the signs before leaving town. The raffle will take place 10 to 15 days after
closing the Indiegogo campaign and it will be announced in Facebook. Each donor
will be receiving a ticket number for each $1 dollar donated for the sign.
Multiple Perk purchases will provide donors with multiple chances to win. There
will be four sings to be ruffled:</p>

<p></p>
<p>Woodmont
High School opened in 1967, combining two older high schools: <i>Wood</i>side and Pied<i>mont</i>.  Woodmont, a small,
rural high school, served the southwestern part of the county, including the area known as Possum Kingdom.  Many of our students lived within ten miles
of most of their relatives.  Most had
parents and grandparents who had attended the older schools.  Several lived on county roads that bore their
family name.</p>
<p>As
time passed, Woodmont’s buildings became inadequate, especially to support the
demands of new technology.  We moved into our current
state-of-the-art facility in 2005.  The
school district modified Woodmont’s attendance area to take advantage of the new,
larger space, and our student population quickly grew to more than 1600, doubling
the student body in a decade. </p>
<p>The attendance area of the new Woodmont High encompasses nearly 150 square miles.  Some new subdivisions have attracted people
from other states, but most of our students still live in the former mill towns
of Piedmont, Pelzer, and Williamston or out in the undeveloped portions of the
county.  While some students live close
enough to walk and some drive themselves a few miles, others must travel more
than an hour every day on the bus to get to school.</p>
<p>Woodmont’s
poverty index is 62% which means that nearly 1000 of our students receive
assistance in the form of free or reduced meals, Medicare, and Medicaid.  35% of my IB students are in that category.  Some of our students have never traveled
outside of the county.  Some have never
seen the ocean or flown in an airplane.  Many
of our seniors this year will be the first members of their family to graduate
from high school.  Many more will be the
first to attend college, including several of my IB kids.</p>
<p>Woodmont
offers a dozen Advanced Placement classes, giving students the opportunity to
earn college credit in high school.  We
are an International Baccalaureate World School, providing challenging classes
that prepare students for admission into top colleges and universities.  85% of the class of 2014 enrolled in college
and earned scholarship offers worth more than 3.1 million dollars. </p>

joined the Woodmont English Department in 1986. 
In 2001, the International Baccalaureate Organization authorized
Woodmont to offer IB classes and to prepare students for the IB diploma.  After two years of training, I became the
teacher of IB English, Higher Level, and taught my first class in 2002.</span><br/></p>
<p>Because
of the numerous benefits travel provides, because of the limited opportunities
my students had, and because there ought to be something international in an IB
school, I began looking into ways to take my students to England and Ireland.</p>
<p>After
some fits and starts, I finally took my first group of students abroad in April
of 2007.  I took another group in 2009
and my third in 2011.  Despite supportive
parents and administrators, economic pressures scuttled trips for 2013 and
2015.  </p>

<p></p>
<p>Now,
there’s Indiegogo and the power of crowd-funding.  By using Indiegogo’s platform and the
multiplying power of social media and social networks, I can help my students
travel to Ireland, Wales, and England in Spring 2016.  Even though the economic reality for many of
my students remains harsh, you can enable them to see the places from which
James Joyce, Frank McCourt, Dylan Thomas, and William Shakespeare drew their
inspiration; touch the door of number 7 Eccles Street; take in the breathtaking
beauty of Wales; take a seat at the Globe. 
Not only will this trip make literature live for these students, 2016
marks the centennial of Ireland’s Easter Rising, the beginning of Irish
independence.  Imagine the excitement of
being in Dublin for such a historic celebration!  Your donation will give the world to some
hard-working students who deserve a little help, students who need to see some
of the world beyond their homes, students whose lives will change forever as a
result of your generosity.</p>
<p>
</p><h2>WHERE YOUR DONATION GOES</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p>After
paying expenses, an independent financial advisor will distribute donated funds
directly to our travel company on behalf of qualified students.  Students will qualify for different amounts
of financial help depending on their demonstrated need.  Demonstrated need will reflect household
income and the number of dependents.  One
student may need $500, for example, while another needs $2500.  To paraphrase Thomas Paine, we esteem too
lightly what we get too easily, so every student will pay at least $1000 toward
the trip.  This is still a large
financial burden for many of them but a much more attainable one than the full
cost of the trip.  By the way, even though
Explorica says I can travel for free, I always pay the regular full price for my
trip because it is wrong to travel on the backs of my kids.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1209981/files/20150209191012-Capture.JPG?1423537812"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><h2>WHAT PAST STUDENTS SAY</h2>
<p></p>
<p>“Visiting the British Museum and the Joyce residence put the
things I had been learning into a physical form. Not only for English, the
class that went on the trip, but for other subjects as well. I was now not only
imagining the cities where scenes took place in classic literature, such as <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, but I was walking around
there, envisioning it for myself, in person.”</p>
<p>“I think
the most rewarding education impact of the trip was simply seeing the origins
of what we had studied for so long.”</p>
<p>“I
really loved that you had us keep a travel journal while we were there. I had
never done anything like that on a trip before, and it taught me to reflect and
think about what I was experiencing.”</p>
<p>“Not only was it enriching
for my personal experience, it really helped me understand the literature we
were studying at the time. Dublin and London were no longer places in the far
distance, but cities that I could actually visit. I think everyone deserves the
opportunity to visit other countries.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn't trade that
experience for anything! It opened my eyes up to new places and started my
travel bug!”</p>
<p>“Spending
my spring break with my school family in Europe is my favorite memory from high
school, and I think everyone deserves (and needs) the opportunity to experience
. . . the world beyond South Carolina.”</p></div>","OUR STORY

inspiration; touch the door of number 7 Eccles Street; take in the breathtaking
beauty of Wales; take a seat at the Globe. 
Not only will this trip make literature live for these students, 2016
marks the centennial of Ireland’s Easter Rising, the beginning of Irish
independence.  Imagine the excitement of
being in Dublin for such a historic celebration!  Your donation will give the world to some
hard-working students who deserve a little help, students who need to see some
of the world beyond their homes, students whose lives will change forever as a
result of your generosity.

WHERE YOUR DONATION GOES


After
paying expenses, an independent financial advisor will distribute donated funds
directly to our travel company on behalf of qualified students.  Students will qualify for different amounts
of financial help depending on their demonstrated need.  Demonstrated need will reflect household
income and the number of dependents.  One
student may need $500, for example, while another needs $2500.  To paraphrase Thomas Paine, we esteem too
lightly what we get too easily, so every student will pay at least $1000 toward
the trip.  This is still a large
financial burden for many of them but a much more attainable one than the full
cost of the trip.  By the way, even though
Explorica says I can travel for free, I always pay the regular full price for my
trip because it is wrong to travel on the backs of my kids.

WHAT PAST STUDENTS SAY

“Visiting the British Museum and the Joyce residence put the
things I had been learning into a physical form. Not only for English, the
class that went on the trip, but for other subjects as well. I was now not only
imagining the cities where scenes took place in classic literature, such as Mrs. Dalloway, but I was walking around
there, envisioning it for myself, in person.”
“I think
the most rewarding education impact of the trip was simply seeing the origins
of what we had studied for so long.”
“I
really loved that you had us keep a travel journal while we were there. I had
never done anything like that on a trip before, and it taught me to reflect and
think about what I was experiencing.”
“Not only was it enriching
for my personal experience, it really helped me understand the literature we
were studying at the time. Dublin and London were no longer places in the far
distance, but cities that I could actually visit. I think everyone deserves the
opportunity to visit other countries.”
“I wouldn't trade that
experience for anything! It opened my eyes up to new places and started my
travel bug!”
“Spending
my spring break with my school family in Europe is my favorite memory from high
school, and I think everyone deserves (and needs) the opportunity to experience
. . . the world beyond South Carolina.”",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello, my name is Dwane Boucher and I want to
invite you to join our adventure!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As a commercial airline pilot, retired USAF Lt
Col, and Eagle Scout; I'm no stranger to adventurous living, however back in
May of 2000, a chance encounter with fellow aviator, Bob Morgan, ultimately
led me to Israel, an ancient stepped passageway, and an ""Indiana
Jones"" experience in search of King Solomon's Lost Temple Treasures!</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><i><u><i>What is the Copper Scroll? </i></u><br/></i></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Central to this great adventure is the 1952
discovery of an enigmatic scroll made of copper. The Copper Scroll (as it was ultimately named) was uncovered in the 3rd of 11 caves during the famed Dead
Sea Scrolls excavations at Khirbet Qumran; its subsequent 1960 translation, of
hammered Mishnaic Hebrew characters, by John Allegro, rocked that era’s archaeological
world! Surprisingly, locked away in this thin 99% pure copper sheet was found a nearly
two millennia old treasure registry that literally described the whereabouts of 64
separate treasure caches of gold, silver, and
other valuables estimated to be worth billions of US dollars.</p><p></p><p><u><i>Are the treasures real?</i></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dating back to the time of the First Jewish
Rebellion in 66 AD, scholars give credence to the theory that priests, facing
an impending invasion by Roman troops, removed, buried, and subsequently
recorded the whereabouts of Jerusalem's sacred temple treasures onto a specially formed and resilient
copper sheet which they secretly hid away, with other sacred biblical scrolls, in hopes of returning to restore them to the temple at a later date. Unfortunately, by 70 AD,
the Jewish Rebellion had been quelled, Jerusalem's temple destroyed, and the
remnant of the Jewish population (and the treasure secret) erased in a mass suicide in lieu of their impending surrender to the Roman siege at Masada. Until
the 1952 Copper Scroll discovery, no other historical record of these lost
treasures have existed.</p><p></p><p><u><i>Where are the treasures buried?</i></u></p><div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since the 1960 Copper Scroll translation, hosts of archaeologist, scholars, and treasure hunters alike have scoured the Judean Desert searching for the inscribed treasure locations without success, but more recently, new tunnel discoveries have reignited hope. Surprisingly, past difficulties in locating the various Copper Scroll sites, were simply due to the fact that most of the cultural landmarks, used to describe these burial locations, weren't in existence anymore. Nevertheless, Bob Morgan's amateur explorations happened upon Mount Hyrcania and it's mysterious ""stepped passageway."" Unfortunately, after four years and 360 feet of excavations, the hope of any epic treasure discoveries were dashed when neither Bob, nor lead archaeologist Doctor Oren Gutfeld (of Hebrew University) could locate any such relics or helpful clues. The significance of the find, however, strongly reinforced their belief that any future - similarly constructed - finds would be otherwise well worth the pursuit. Excitingly, this exact type of discovery was made by Dr. Gutfeld through his Bedouin network four years ago; in fact, two of these stepped passageways have been identified, but their whereabouts have been secreted away in order to allow Antiquity Quest an adequate amount of time to prepare and raise funds to begin our next tantalizing archaeological chapter!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><u><i>What is our quest?</i></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Antiquity Quest, LLC was formed for the
purpose of conducting excavations at these new tunnels and to uncover the truth of what lies beneath, but the digs also
represent a unique opportunity to tell an important story to the world. Our initial cadre of
fellow archaeological adventurers and contributors have since begun the process of official permitting and preparation for upcoming tunnel excavations slated for December, 2015. Of equal significance, as with any modern undertaking as such, is also in capturing the sequence of collaborative
human elements and documenting the unfolding story surrounding the enterprise. As was the case at Hyrcania, the uncharacteristic assembly of Jews, Muslims, and Christians reuniting for this

mention the rest of the world if this effort leads to a discovery of King

organizations, governments and media outlets alike will be clamoring for
access to the site, the discoveries; all wanting to learn more of the story. The value of the treasures is another
matter since estimates could run in the billions of US dollars, and the priceless nature of its historical
and religious significance would be off the charts. Perhaps the most immediate and
significant impact of this endeavor will come from capturing this epic on film. Whether
treasures are discovered or not, creating a reality format documentary will only pave the way to tell an important and timely story of cooperation and friendship. In a
part of the world, where hope is thought to be as dry as the desert, this story of humanity (among Jews, Muslims and Christians alike) is a message the world desparately needs to hear.  </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Because of the confounding nature of this endeavor, there
is a low probability of success in finding relics or treasures from Solomon’s temple. Moreover,
the political instability in the area could adversely affect the excavation
schedule and ultimately prevent excavation work at this proposed dig-site. Potential
military conflict, in the region, could also make the proposed site a high-risk
area to excavate and could lead to delays, or even cancellation of the
excavation effort itself. There is always the potential for injury and even
death for those who choose to take part in the excavation efforts as the structural integrity of these ancient tunnels is unknown and the overall effort itself represents an inherently dangerous activity. Finally, the ownership, of any
treasure or relics discovered during this endeavor, is unknown due to the potential
for multiple governmental claims to whatever our team may uncover. The good news is that, based on Israeli

</div></div>","OUR INDIEGOGO STORY
Hello, my name is Dwane Boucher and I want to
invite you to join our adventure!
As a commercial airline pilot, retired USAF Lt
Col, and Eagle Scout; I'm no stranger to adventurous living, however back in
May of 2000, a chance encounter with fellow aviator, Bob Morgan, ultimately
led me to Israel, an ancient stepped passageway, and an ""Indiana
Jones"" experience in search of King Solomon's Lost Temple Treasures!What is the Copper Scroll? Central to this great adventure is the 1952
discovery of an enigmatic scroll made of copper. The Copper Scroll (as it was ultimately named) was uncovered in the 3rd of 11 caves during the famed Dead
Sea Scrolls excavations at Khirbet Qumran; its subsequent 1960 translation, of
hammered Mishnaic Hebrew characters, by John Allegro, rocked that era’s archaeological
world! Surprisingly, locked away in this thin 99% pure copper sheet was found a nearly
two millennia old treasure registry that literally described the whereabouts of 64
separate treasure caches of gold, silver, and
other valuables estimated to be worth billions of US dollars.Are the treasures real?
Dating back to the time of the First Jewish
Rebellion in 66 AD, scholars give credence to the theory that priests, facing
an impending invasion by Roman troops, removed, buried, and subsequently
recorded the whereabouts of Jerusalem's sacred temple treasures onto a specially formed and resilient
copper sheet which they secretly hid away, with other sacred biblical scrolls, in hopes of returning to restore them to the temple at a later date. Unfortunately, by 70 AD,
the Jewish Rebellion had been quelled, Jerusalem's temple destroyed, and the
remnant of the Jewish population (and the treasure secret) erased in a mass suicide in lieu of their impending surrender to the Roman siege at Masada. Until
the 1952 Copper Scroll discovery, no other historical record of these lost
treasures have existed.Where are the treasures buried?
Since the 1960 Copper Scroll translation, hosts of archaeologist, scholars, and treasure hunters alike have scoured the Judean Desert searching for the inscribed treasure locations without success, but more recently, new tunnel discoveries have reignited hope. Surprisingly, past difficulties in locating the various Copper Scroll sites, were simply due to the fact that most of the cultural landmarks, used to describe these burial locations, weren't in existence anymore. Nevertheless, Bob Morgan's amateur explorations happened upon Mount Hyrcania and it's mysterious ""stepped passageway."" Unfortunately, after four years and 360 feet of excavations, the hope of any epic treasure discoveries were dashed when neither Bob, nor lead archaeologist Doctor Oren Gutfeld (of Hebrew University) could locate any such relics or helpful clues. The significance of the find, however, strongly reinforced their belief that any future - similarly constructed - finds would be otherwise well worth the pursuit. Excitingly, this exact type of discovery was made by Dr. Gutfeld through his Bedouin network four years ago; in fact, two of these stepped passageways have been identified, but their whereabouts have been secreted away in order to allow Antiquity Quest an adequate amount of time to prepare and raise funds to begin our next tantalizing archaeological chapter!
What is our quest?
Antiquity Quest, LLC was formed for the
purpose of conducting excavations at these new tunnels and to uncover the truth of what lies beneath, but the digs also
represent a unique opportunity to tell an important story to the world. Our initial cadre of
fellow archaeological adventurers and contributors have since begun the process of official permitting and preparation for upcoming tunnel excavations slated for December, 2015. Of equal significance, as with any modern undertaking as such, is also in capturing the sequence of collaborative
human elements and documenting the unfolding story surrounding the enterprise. As was the case at Hyrcania, the uncharacteristic assembly of Jews, Muslims, and Christians reuniting for this
expedition (digging side by side) represents a ""high water mark"" for an epic story of hope, discovery and
friendship in the Middle East. In what may prove to be the ""real treasure"" discovery, we intend to document this untold story of camaraderie and unity on film. By chipping away at the myths surrounding unfavorable media portrayals, we hope to shed light on true regional potentials such that the world may gain a new perspective of the beliefs, the cultures, and the humanity of the people that represent the key players for peace in this notorious, yet historic, part of the
world.

At Xanadu Academy, there will be no trade-offs, we will encourage each student to maximize their full potential in all fields.</p>

Construct a quality school building 
Provide world class secondary education
Create sustainable employment
Promote environmentally sustainable practices

Quality secondary education with an emphasis on language, planning, sustainability, technology, and short and long term job creation. Xanadu Academy aims to provide the next generations with the skills to improve the future of Nigeria. We will adopt a holistic approach to education that internalizes culture, economy and nature to empower generations of game changers as they enter the global playing field. Xanadu Academy will be a private boarding school located in Lagos, Nigeria, the fastest growing international megapolis in Africa. Due to the high level of growth and entrepreneurial grit in the country, Lagos will become the future engine of Africa's economic presence in the world and we believe education is the gateway to mobilize human capital.


""We invite you in to be part of an ambitious project with far reaching impact"". 



The planned facade of  our main school building.

Why Our Campaign is Important 
We
started Xanadu Academy because at the very core, we are creators and entrepreneurs keen to build something from the ground up. Having travelled the world, we know that education makes a direct and significant
impact on socio-economic growth and progress, which promotes freedom and equality. We believe that education in Nigeria can be greatly improved by incorporating a comprehensive curriculum. We believe that the secondary school curriculum in Nigeria is not well-balanced as it focuses solely on academic achievement at the expense of arts, sports, and creativity and thereby limits the student's potential. At Xanadu Academy, there will be no trade-offs, we will encourage each student to maximize their full potential in all fields.
Environment
A strong environmental profile mixed
with interactive learning will ensure critical knowledge and respect for our
planet. We will achieve this by taking full advantage of:
• 
Solar Power-
Our location has tremendous potential in photovoltaic.
• 
Waste Water
Filtering- Critical for human health and the environment.
• 
Composting of
Organic Waste- Briliant way to get rid of waste safely and teach kids about
nature and chemistry.
""We want to give Nigerian youths the tools to maximize their potential so Nigeria can be all she can be and more"".
Xanadu
Academy is our way of positively
impacting on future generations through education at a delicate time in Nigeria where the southern regions are making significant sociocultural and economic progress while simultaneously, human rights are been violently challenged in the north.  We want to educate students who will go on to
become inventors, scientists, free thinkers, writers, teachers, doctors, composers, planners, athletes, activists, entrepreneurs or environmentalists, equipped with the skills to improve society. We believe that Africa is central to the
future, education is the key and we are honored to play this part, no matter how small, in guaranteeing quality education to youths.


 
Construction in Nigeria is extremely labor intensive and a construction project like Xanadu Academy is creating a considerable amount of local jobs. Here, our Builders are pouring concrete into the foundation. 

Job Creation
Jobs are essential. Without jobs and a source of income, affording basic life necessities is impossible. Without an income, we most likely cannot feed our children and send them to school. 
Given this, we are proud to be able to create a substantial amount of jobs to construction workers, planners, service providers, teachers and more. Below, we present our current achievements and future estimates in job creation.





In other words, your donations enable us to pay our construction workers and bring us one step closer to hiring the rest of the faculty and staff that will facilitate the smooth operation of the school, now and for years to come.
In addition to providing quality education, job creation is a very important aspect of this project, at the same time it´s what makes this project such a good investment. We plan to continue to expand and grow Xanadu Academy over the coming years, meaning that we will provide job opportunities for up towards 100 people annually. Not bad for a semi-crowdfunded project!


What We Need 

 There are three levels to construct for Xanadu Academy's school building. Presently, we have secured funding that makes this project realistic and within reach. So, your contribution will ensure that construction is completed and that Xanadu Academy is operational by the Fall of 2016.  During this campaign, we will continue to work as far as our funding can reach and your support will guarantee that the construction of Xanadu Academy is finished.  We are still working very hard to reach our goal, and for this reason, we turn to you, to support us in raising $25,000.00.

In the event that we do not reach our fundraising goal, 25% of what we raise will still go towards paying workers; and 75% towards purchasing building materials.

The Impact 
We are well aware that Xanadu Academy is an ambitious project, but we undoubtedly believe that it is not impossible.  Upon completion of construction, Xanadu Academy will  provide valuable and comprehensive education for each student. Our reputation of successfully inspiring students to reach their full potential will speak for itself.

</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>MoLab, Inc., a 501(c)3
not-for-profit corporation, was founded by two passionate women who shared a
vision to go beyond the confinement of a physical location to offer  exciting experiences that promote curiosity and
understanding of the sciences. With over 27 years of combined science center
experience, the founders of MoLab are knowledgeable informal educators who will
be able to drive science education to schools, after-school activities,
community events, and drive home the importance of Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education.</p>
<p><b>Mission Statement:</b> To provide on-the-go, dynamic, hands-on and
inquiry-based science experiences through a mobile laboratory that promotes
discovery. </p>
<p><b>Vision Statement: </b>MoLab's vision is to provide resources that cultivate and
inspire a greater understanding of the role of sciences in our world.</p>
<p><b>Philosophy</b>: MoLab's philosophy is based on equal access to hands-on
science education and expertise – creatively and positively impacting those we
serve.</p>
<p>The goal of MoLab is to enhance
student achievement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
in a fun, interactive setting that allows students to realize career paths in
STEM related fields. All of MoLab's programs assist in developing 21st Century
learning skills through project-based education and help promote digital
literacy through programs that enable youth to think, create, and communicate
effectively.</p>
<p>Based on successful models
throughout the country and a member of the Mobile Laboratory Coalition, MoLab
provides a vehicle for onsite and offsite interactive engagement. The founders
share an excitement for increasing hands-on inquiry in education, for creating
the “aha” moments, and for inspiring the next generation of innovators.</p>
<p>Recently, MoLab purchased a 1994
Fleetwood Flair Diesel Pusher. The vehicle needs to be retrofitted to transform
it into a mobile discovery center we call MoBus. The vision for MoBus is for it
to be a cutting-edge vehicle utilizing environmentally friendly technologies
and advancements to demonstrate how science innovations can be applied to our
daily lives. MoBus will run on veggie waste oil, as biodiesel, in order to
lessen its carbon footprint and reduce its environmental impact. MoBus will
evolve to always be fuel efficient and be a model of sustainability. MoBus will
additionally be powered by solar panels located on the roof. The innovations
that will be incorporated will make it a learning experience in and of itself.
 </p>
<p>Inside MoBus, MoLab will have
state-of-the-art equipment featuring microscopy stations, an entomology and
biology wall, works stations, and televisions throughout for microscope projections
and demonstrations. Outside, utilizing environmentally friendly paint, MoBus
will be bright, colorful, and inviting as well as incorporate fun science facts. MoLab
will work with the Mobile Laboratory Coalition to gain insight on best
practices and designs for fitting a mobile science laboratory. </p>
<p>This science-to-go format allows
MoLab to serve a broad, diverse audience over a large geographical region, both
in rural and urban environments. MoLab's effectiveness in serving science
educators and students has no limits or boundaries. </p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign will help
provide the necessary funds in order to meet MoBus's retrofitting needs. This
is vitally important to MoLab's mission of providing on-the-go, dynamic,
hands-on and inquiry-based science experiences through a mobile laboratory that
promotes discovery. We need MoBus!</p>
<p>In one year's time, MoLab was
launched; provided innovative, hands-on programming; executed its camp program,
Camp Spark - Igniting Knowledge!; created community partnerships; received
grants; purchased an RV; and positively affected the lives of the children we
served. Contributors to this campaign will help achieve another success for
MoLab - the opportunity to properly outfit our mobile science laboratory -
MoBus! The magnitude of having our vision become a reality, through the
generosity of others, is immense! Your contributions will have a wide impact.</p>

<strong>The Impact</strong> <p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></span></p>
<p>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
(STEM) are the fundamental building blocks for modernization. A thriving 21<sup>st</sup>
century community is made up of educated and engaged citizens. Educating
students and introducing them to STEM topics promotes career development and
supplies the future workforce of scientists, technologists, engineers, and
mathematicians. MoLab is committed to providing engaging programming to create
the next generation of innovators and inspired learners. </p>
<p>The tools needed to progress our students forward
are lacking. More and more students are seeking degrees in fields other than
STEM, while at the same time more jobs are available in areas of STEM.
Scientific investigation and education create groups of inquiry-minded
individuals. These individuals will seek to find answers to some of our most
important questions in health, national safety, and the environment. Instilling
this sense of inquiry at an early age ensures that our next generations to come
will continue to grow our industries, responsibly. Your contribution, no matter
at what level, will help MoLab inspire students to become engaged individuals
who want to seek the answers to solve the world’s scientific problems.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>MoLab has been in existence for a
little over two years now and we have experienced how our unique platform
successfully meets the needs of students. Through our Camp Spark – Igniting
Knowledge! program, our Investigation Workshops, our participation in community
events, and through funds received from grants and partnerships, MoLab has
served 15,389+ students
and families with project-based, hands-on STEM curriculum. With MoBus, the
opportunities are endless as we drive science education to the surrounding
communities and across the State of Florida. </p>

MoLab, Inc., a 501(c)3
not-for-profit corporation, was founded by two passionate women who shared a
vision to go beyond the confinement of a physical location to offer  exciting experiences that promote curiosity and
understanding of the sciences. With over 27 years of combined science center
experience, the founders of MoLab are knowledgeable informal educators who will
be able to drive science education to schools, after-school activities,
community events, and drive home the importance of Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education.
Mission Statement: To provide on-the-go, dynamic, hands-on and
inquiry-based science experiences through a mobile laboratory that promotes
discovery. 
Vision Statement: MoLab's vision is to provide resources that cultivate and
inspire a greater understanding of the role of sciences in our world.
Philosophy: MoLab's philosophy is based on equal access to hands-on
science education and expertise – creatively and positively impacting those we
serve.
The goal of MoLab is to enhance
student achievement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
in a fun, interactive setting that allows students to realize career paths in
STEM related fields. All of MoLab's programs assist in developing 21st Century
learning skills through project-based education and help promote digital
literacy through programs that enable youth to think, create, and communicate
effectively.
Based on successful models
throughout the country and a member of the Mobile Laboratory Coalition, MoLab
provides a vehicle for onsite and offsite interactive engagement. The founders
share an excitement for increasing hands-on inquiry in education, for creating
the “aha” moments, and for inspiring the next generation of innovators.
Recently, MoLab purchased a 1994
Fleetwood Flair Diesel Pusher. The vehicle needs to be retrofitted to transform
it into a mobile discovery center we call MoBus. The vision for MoBus is for it
to be a cutting-edge vehicle utilizing environmentally friendly technologies
and advancements to demonstrate how science innovations can be applied to our
daily lives. MoBus will run on veggie waste oil, as biodiesel, in order to
lessen its carbon footprint and reduce its environmental impact. MoBus will
evolve to always be fuel efficient and be a model of sustainability. MoBus will
additionally be powered by solar panels located on the roof. The innovations
that will be incorporated will make it a learning experience in and of itself.
 
Inside MoBus, MoLab will have
state-of-the-art equipment featuring microscopy stations, an entomology and
biology wall, works stations, and televisions throughout for microscope projections
and demonstrations. Outside, utilizing environmentally friendly paint, MoBus
will be bright, colorful, and inviting as well as incorporate fun science facts. MoLab
will work with the Mobile Laboratory Coalition to gain insight on best
practices and designs for fitting a mobile science laboratory. 
This science-to-go format allows
MoLab to serve a broad, diverse audience over a large geographical region, both
in rural and urban environments. MoLab's effectiveness in serving science
educators and students has no limits or boundaries. 
This Indiegogo campaign will help
provide the necessary funds in order to meet MoBus's retrofitting needs. This
is vitally important to MoLab's mission of providing on-the-go, dynamic,
hands-on and inquiry-based science experiences through a mobile laboratory that
promotes discovery. We need MoBus!
In one year's time, MoLab was
launched; provided innovative, hands-on programming; executed its camp program,
Camp Spark - Igniting Knowledge!; created community partnerships; received
grants; purchased an RV; and positively affected the lives of the children we
served. Contributors to this campaign will help achieve another success for
MoLab - the opportunity to properly outfit our mobile science laboratory -
MoBus! The magnitude of having our vision become a reality, through the
generosity of others, is immense! Your contributions will have a wide impact.

<p>In short, <i>Media Savvy</i> is our highly
successful and innovative social enterprise, based in the North East of
England. We specialise in a learning by stealth approach, delivering digital
arts and media based provisions, whilst promoting core employability skills.
 The company has been highly commended with awards and achievements since
we began in 2010.</p>
<p>Due to very specific links in Ghana, and
due to a high market demand, we are launching a similar venture in one of the
largest cities over there. Sunyani is significant in size and population and is
comparable to a City such as Sunderland, where <i>Media Savvy i</i>s based.
 However, there are limited opportunities for the local people to engage
with, compared to other cities in the county.</p>
<p>Africa is
the continent that can sometimes be mistaken for a country; a land of billions
which is primarily characterised by famine or poverty. West Africa, in
particular heavily embraces emerging technologies and all things ‘digital’.
Formal training for the next generation in media, film making, journalism etc. is
vital in telling the stories of the varied countries and cultures.  It is also important to let the the wider world know that Ghana is a great place to visit and invest in. In a nutshell, there’s a critical element
of ‘giving a voice to the voiceless’ in the same way that <i>Media Savvy </i>does in the UK.</p>

Success  will not only mean we have helped make a positive social difference out in Ghana, but ultimately ensuring <i>Media Savvy</i> is sustainable so we can continue our important work helping the marginalised groups we focus on here in the UK.</p><p>We must stress that this is a not-for-profit venture and any surplus income will be ploughed back into making the venture bigger and better.

individuals and also Perks that are specifically linked to <i>Media Savvy </i>providing a service to your business.</p>

If we do not reach our target, all funds raised will still contribute towards our cause, and if all else fails, we will find a way to self-fund any shortfall
We've already had some kind cash donations to-date and we will acknowledge absolutely all contributors once our fundraising is over.Social ImpactThere are significant opportunities to develop new and grow existing businesses within the Media sector in Sunyani. Growing these digital-orientated businesses will have a huge positive impact on the economy of the region, the skills development and employment opportunities.Local knowledge and specific market research tells us there is a high demand for the types of creative digital skills that we are planning to deliver. We are in a unique position to fulfil this market need, due to our expertise, local knowledge and previous track record of delivering highly commended courses in this sector.Images: Taken at a visit to the Queen of Peace School in MayRisks & ChallengesWe have already invested a considerable amount of time, money and effort on the project, to get to this stage. We WILL be successful, but with your help we will be successful much sooner, and so, we can start making a difference now.We have 5 years of experience running our successful social enterprise in the UK and this experience will certainly help us make our Ghanaian venture become a success.More incentive?A small group of us are (attempting) the 3-Peaks 24-hour challenge in early July. We feel its only right that along with all of the hard work evolving the project, we also embrace some physical pain to boot to help persuade you to part with your hard earned cash! Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute £, but that doesn't mean you can't help in other ways:
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about the campaign.

develop projects which can break the cycle of violence and convert their
communities into peaceful territories.</p>

<p><b>Why Buenaventura?</b></p>
<p>The municipality of
Buenaventura, in the region of Valle de Cauca, is one of the most important
ports of Colombia and is considered to be one of the most biodiverse areas in
the country. However, it is currently an area where illegal armed disputes,
drug cartles and crime is rife. News reports are constantly filled with daily
stories regarding attacks on rural communities or the dimemebering of community
members.  There are even specifically designated houses existing within the community where people are taken to be dismembered and body parts are hidden leaving no traces. People living in these communities have to confront
poverty, violence, fear, listening to screams of torture  and total abaondment from the State on a
daily basis. Men, women, girls and boys are not able to speak up about what is
happening in their communities for fear of becoming victims of violence.
Empowering the population to become agents of peace will lead to the creation of
a unified voice aiming to break the cycle of violence and build a culture of
peace.</p>

<p>In the
present day, technological innovation is forever changing the world we are
living in. Nowadays, the majority of our personal information is collected,
stored and analyzed through various devices such as mobile phones, tablets and
personal computers. With the assortment of private information, virtual
profiles are being created that identify our personal tastes, preferences,
track our current locations and monitor how we spend our free time. </p>
<p>These
virtual profiles that contain sensitive private information is being sold to
third party venders without our knowledge, consent or financial compensation in
exchange. Advertisers who obtain this data target us as future consumers by
personalizing their marketing mix to match our desires. </p><p><b>Our Goal</b></p>
<p>Our goal
at We Love Data is to provide every multimedia user the
opportunity to capitalize on their own personal data. By downloading our
well-developed application for various mobile devices we enable you, the user,
to manage your own data output and make it publically available for
compensation at your discretion. All data collected by the app is saved
centrally which makes it easier to create comprehensive personal profiles that
truly reflect who you are. </p>
<p>Furthermore,
the application provides the user to be rewarded for sharing his personal
information. If his data is sold three different times to third party venders
(which we will track), he will receive three times an X amount of money. Any
earnings made on the transactions are paid at the end of each month they accrue
in. </p>
<p>Lastly,
the application offers the user transparency and control over his data, not
some advertiser. This is achieved by giving the user full ability to manage
which data he wants to make publically available and which data he wants to
remain private. In other words, each individual has the opportunity to
determine their own earnings for data that is public while safeguarding any
data they deem to be private. </p>
<p><b>The Project </b></p>
<p>Specifically,
the project consists of the development and commercialization of an application
that is readily available on mobile devices, as well as, browser plugins that
users can freely download. Each of the applications or user plugins was
designed to be user friendly and have attractive features. The simple to use
interface in the application helps track, as well as, manage your personal
tastes and preferences. All in all, we believe that this application will help
bridge firms and consumers closer together by offering each party not only
financial compensation, but security as well. </p>
<p>This is
why we are here today to help illustrate the true potential of this project
through your investment in our company. </p>
<p><b>Where Did the Idea Come From?</b></p>
<p>As a
current marketing student it has become apparent how technology is changing the
way we live our lives, do business and communicate with one another. Having
done my research and following the market trends currently being observed it is
evident that big data, especially, personal information is the next big thing.
As a result, I came up with this idea to provide people like myself the
opportunity to sell data of my choosing to companies in exchange for financial
compensation. With the ever changing digital environment and its influence on
marketing I was eager to join the competition. Through this application I feel
that companies will be able to better suit my needs through targeted and
effective marketing campaigns that are not only tailored for me, but by me. In
doing so, I provide users like myself the awareness and ability to make my
information a tradable commodity. Not only will this application offer that,
but it will compensate people for it. </p>
<p><b>Risks Faced </b></p>
<p>With
anything in life, there are many risks and challenges that lie ahead.
Currently, our biggest risk is the making sure the safety of our user’s data is
protected. Additionally, the largest challenge we face is commercializing this
application and making both firms and consumers aware of it. With the right
leadership, execution and financing, we can make this a reality. As early
adoption becomes more main stream, the goodwill will give both consumers and
firms the chance to profit. By investing in the launching of this app we will
all be a part of something truly rewarding, but also personally unique. </p><br/></div>","The Problem
