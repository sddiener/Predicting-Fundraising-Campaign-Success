My Name is
Ian Lawson and I am a senior mechanical engineer at Oregon State University.
For my last year I have decided to live out of my van to save on money. So far
it has been a ton of fun and but there is one thing missing. I can't charge my
phone at night or plug in any appliances. 

I have
always been a supporter of green energy and helping the environment in any way
I can. Putting a solar kit on the van seemed like a great solution to my power
problem and a great way to actualize my passions about green energy. The van
would need a panel, battery, inverter, and regulator in order to run
independent from the cars components. Rose City Solar, a small company trying
to get its start, will be designing and implementing the installation plan. 

The Impact

The
sun is an infinite source of energy and seems as of yet to be fully realized.
Other countries such as china have started putting solar panels on every
surface possible. It’s time for Oregon, known for its environmentalists, to go
solar. Putting a solar panel on my van will grab people’s attention. If you can
put a solar panel on a van you can put a solar panel almost anywhere. As a
mechanical engineer and Rose City Solar’s lead installer I will be able to
explain the workings of the solar kit to anyone who is interested. Let’s spread
the word about solar energy! I can't wait to be living proof of its success.

<p>My Name is Floor Siemons, I've been working with horses and riders for over 20 Years. In this period I've had, and seen some (very) painful accidents. Every year people get injured while riding a horse. The concern of my relatives is that I'll fall of a horse get injured and they can’t find me. I can call them with my cell phone but how do I explain where I am if I’m in the middle of the woods?? To locate a victim outdoors I've thought of a solution. <br/><br/>For myself I like to keep track of my performances while training outdoors I have been using a runners App to log my exercising. The idea is to combine a safety alert with an App to log exercises and routes. More fun for me and less worries that a rider will fall without anyone knowing it. I think a lot of riders (and parents of young riders) wil feel more safe and have better training results and more fun.<br/><br/>I designed this product for equestrian sports but it can be helpful in other outdoor (extreme) sports also.</p>
<p>So help make outdoor riding (and other sports) safer, de rider alarm doesn't make an accident lesspainfull, it doesnt prevent riders from falling, but it will get you home faster.</p>

</p><p>The Northeast Disables Athletic
Association is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization based in Burlington, VT. We have created this
campaign to spread the word about a great opportunity for people like you to become a partner in the
success of our Vermont Chargers Power Soccer Club. The Vermont Chargers aim to
provide participants with quadriplegia, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy,
cerebral palsy, head trauma, stroke, spinal cord injury and other disabilities
requiring the use of power wheel chairs the opportunity to play for a team and
compete in a way that they would not otherwise be able to. The significance of
this is that the leadership, teamwork, loyalty, and sportsmanship skills that
this sport offers to these athletes are extremely unique and provide
irreplaceable experiences in their lives.  </p>
<p>The mission of this campaign is to
raise money and awareness for those with disabilities wanting to participate in
adapted sports, specifically encouraging participation in power soccer
throughout the state of Vermont. All donations will go towards assisting the
Vermont Chargers journey in representing Vermont at the United States Power Soccer
Association (USPSA) Presidents’ Cup national championship in June.  </p>
<p>For this 35-day campaign we have set
a fundraising target of $7,500 to help us achieve our goal of returning to the
national championship.  This would help
us cover a large portion of the cost of airfare, lodging, registration and
other expenses for sending 13 players, coaches and assistants to the USPSA Presidents Cup. Any donation you can provide to help us reach our fundraising goal is greatly appreciated. Your
donation will be tax deductible and your contribution will really be making a
difference in the lives of athletes with disabilities.  Only through the generous support of the
community can we make our goal a reality.</p>
<p>The Chargers were established in 2010 and are members of the United States
Power Soccer Association (USPSA). Power soccer is a four-on-four game
played on a regulation-size basketball court by power wheelchair users. The Chargers are the only team in Vermont
and are currently regarded as a top team in New England. Last season, we traveled
to Indianapolis, IN to compete for the national title and captured 4<sup>th</sup>
place amongst teams from around the USA. This was a great finish for the team and
it could not be done without the moral and financial support of friends, family
and the community.  While we are proud of
last year’s finish, we have set our sights even higher for this season and are
striving to bring the Presidents Cup to Vermont. Bringing a national title back
to Vermont this year will not be possible without the financial support members
of the community such as yourselves. </p>

all about inspiring people.
We believe
that every person is important. Everyone plays a role in creation of something,
but sometimes it gets hard to see that. In times of doubt we want to inspire and motivate people in the form of wallpapers.
Imagine
that your phone will show you a new Quote every day. It will help you stay motivated throughout the day and encourage you to be who you really are.Imagine your phone showing you breathtaking horizons, reminding you to explore the beauty of this world. And think of your phone with extraordinary illustrations that embolden your vision and make you think bigger.That's what we are striving for. We want people to get inspired every day.Join us in this mission to make this world a better place.About this appWe have spent countless nights brainstorming about this idea. This app is very easy and intuitive to use.The main thing about this app is that it will automatically change the wallpaper on your phone on a daily basis.Nevertheless you can always change the wallpaper you don't like just by swiping it away.You can choose a type of wallpapers to display. No unnecessary complications - just Quotes, Photography and Illustrations.
Every wallpaper is made and submitted to Geta by professional designers, photographers and illustrators. So under every wallpaper you can find the name, description and contact information about the person who made it.This gives a great opportunity for creative professionals to showcase their work and gain exposure in a way that has never been done before. So you're not just helping us, you're also helping them.It will be a cross-platform applicationGeta will work on android phones & tablets, as well as Windows & iOS computers.What we've done so farWe have launched our website. It is a place where designers, photographers and illustrators can upload their work to Geta.

We welcome all creative professionals to visit our website and upload your work.What we needWe have been working on Geta for half a year now, but we need funding to cover our daily expenses.What you getWe are very eager to motivate and inspire people. So we hope you'll like our perks.Our most valuable perk is a stencil art made by one of our team members, Bayaraa.Our goalOur goal is to reach 21000 $ by 30th of November.All we need is your help to get this project going.Other ways in which you can help

<h3>Idea:</h3>
<p>My Moto Mod Candidate is probably the most simple and elegant thing that can be attached to a Moto Z.  The existing style shells give a warmth and personality to the Moto Z, but they do not have any functionality.  They are for looks only; and with a platform as versatile as the Moto Z, why would you attach anything to it that does not provide some functionality?  My idea was to integrate wireless charging and infrared emitters in a stylish accessory barely thicker than the existing style shells. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>I am currently working on a prototype, which is nearing completion.  The electronic components have been tested with the phone and work as intended.  The wood housing is nearly complete and soon I will have a working proof-of-concept design that will work through the phone's USB port.  Currently all of the components I have used are off the shelf and commercially available.  I need your help to take this prototype to Motorola and work with them to develop the final version which will connect through the Moto Z's Mod connector, as well as refine and finalize the electronics and materials.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In a recent article it was stated that Moto Mods are in use about 10 percent of the time.  This means that 90 percent of the time, it is just a phone, and likely has a style shell attached to it.  If the style shell had function on top of form, it would add utility and convenience over and above what the phone is already capable of.  </p>
<h3>January 28 Update</h3>
<p>I have updated this campaign to include perks.  There is a wireless charging style shell and a wireless charging style shell with infrared.  I have received feedback indicating there is a demand for both products.  Since this is a candidate in Motorola's Mod the Smartphone Challenge, I need to move on to the next step to make this Mod candidate a reality.  There are a lot of unknowns at this point, but I believe this is a great addition to the Moto Z family and is also very desirable and marketable.  With your help we can make this Mod candidate a reality.</p>
<h3>February 1 Update</h3>
<p>Second prototype with infrared coming soon, Stay tuned for updates!!!</p>
<h3>February 4 Update</h3>
<p>Second prototype is operational.  Please see the video at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Inbz9BjV2O0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Inbz9BjV2O0</a>  Thanks to everyone who has contributed, supported, shared or helped get the word out on my campaign.  It has been a great week and I have a lot of people to thank for the success so far.  This prototype is also wired until I can meet with Motorola and finalize the Mod connector, but it is fully functional and is an example of how it works.  </p>

<p>We need your help in developing the free app and website.  Any contribution helps and will go directly towards development of all the features listed. Please take a minute to donate a small amount and lets start making a difference this year!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>Our goals:</strong></h2>
<p>-Help rebuild our local and regional news sources</p>
<p>-Create credible news media for distribution at affordable rates</p>
<p>-Create jobs across the nation</p>
<p>-Help the public keep up with current events in real time</p>
<p>-Give everyone the chance to bring pressing issues to light in a new way</p>
<p>-Get people paid for their newsworthy pictures and videos, instead of letting the news organizations take them for free</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How Gazetta can create jobs in your area and more credible news sources in our country:</strong></h3>
<p>Nearly 130,000 jobs were lost in the news industry in the past decade.  Countless local and regional newspapers have shutdown because they couldn’t make the shift from print to online.  The news sources in our nation have severely dwindled, limiting the amount of credible information that we receive.  Gazetta can help create jobs all over America for journalists, fact checkers and entire online news businesses by providing low-cost local and regional news media and news leads for online editorial use.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Why we need your help:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Simple fact is we can't do this alone, and what would be the fun in that. So we figured what better way to develop the free app and website then let everyone get to be a part of it.  Just a $15 donation from 3000 people would fully fund us!</strong></h3>
<p>The goal amount of $45,000 will allow Gazetta to fully develop and launch our mobile app for both iPhone and Android, the custom ecommerce auction website, the Gazetta News website and a social media integration app.  All of the key features and interactivity listed in this write-up will be part of Gazetta's app and website launch.  Below is a breakdown of the costs:</p>
<p>Mobile app (iPhone, Android):.............$6,350</p>
<p>Ecommerce website:.........................$27,000</p>
<p>Gazetta News website:......................$3,000</p>

<h2><strong>HERES HOW IT WORKS:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Gazetta's free app</strong></h3>
<p>Gazetta's free app will allow you to instantly post pictures and videos directly to our ecommerce website for online news producers (i.e. online newspapers) to browse and purchase.  Simply take a picture or video of a local current event, upload it through our app and put the location, subject matter and a short description.</p>
<p>You can edit, delete and track all of your postings and see which of your media have sold and which ones are still current.  You can also browse and rate other postings in your area for up-to-the-second happenings in your city or town.      </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Gazetta's custom ecommerce website  </strong></h3>
<p>The Gazetta website will strive to be in every newsroom in the nation, whether small or large.  And why wouldn't we be, with Gazetta allowing news producers to have an unlimited coverage area at a speed unmatched at their fingertips.  Local, regional and national news producers will be able to browse, search and monitor news leads as they happen and purchase affordable media at the click of a button.        </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How much you get paid for a sale</strong></h3>
<p>You will receive 50% of the sales price for every one of your postings that is purchased.  The standard pricing for pictures on Gazetta will be $40 and videos will be $80, which means your will receive $20 for a picture and $40 for a video that is sold through Gazetta.  However, every posting has the potential to sell for hundreds of dollars through our Exclusive Rights Bidding system.  You want to earn a higher percentage of the sales price; we offer that too through our Level Up tier system.  See them both explained below.</p>
<p>   </p>
<h2><strong>Key features  --&gt; (You're gonna like this)</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Exclusive Rights Bidding (ERB)</strong></h3>
<p>During the first hour that your picture or video is posted news producers can bid on the right to use it exclusively.  Bids start at double the normal price; $80 for a picture and $160 for a video.  If it doesn’t sell within the first hour it reverts to the standard price of $40 for a picture and $80 for a video, and can still be purchased multiple times.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Level Up</strong></h3>
<p>Gazetta rewards those who work hard with our Level Up system.  The criteria are based upon total sales amount and content ratings for a one-month period.  If you meet the criteria to Level Up you will receive the bonuses associated with your new level for a 6-month period. <strong> Or you can get the one-time offered Perks listed here and Level Up now for life!!  </strong>The levels are broken into three categories:</p>
<p><strong>Newbie</strong>:</p>
<p>The base level where all Gazetta users start.  You get 50% of the sales price of every one of your postings that sells.  </p>
<p><strong>Pro: </strong></p>
<p>The second level is attainable after $120 of total sales and a content rating in good standing during a one-month period.  That’s just 1 of your pictures and 1 video selling, or one really good picture/video selling in ERB.  You will get 60% of the sales price of every one of your postings that sells. You will also be listed as a Pro on all of your postings, which will be visible on the website and make your postings stand out from the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Legendary: </strong></p>

<p>  </p>

<p>Gazetta News will be different than your average online newspaper; we will have an unlimited news coverage area with in-depth local, regional and national current events as they happen.  Also you will be able to customize your Gazetta News homepage to only see the locations or subject matter you wish to read about.   </p>

<h2><strong>When is Gazetta expected to launch:    </strong></h2>
<p>After we meet our goal Gazetta is expecting to launch the Beta version between April and May of this year, only 4-5 months away!  How can you get the Beta version, the only way is to get one of our awesome Perks here from $35 and up.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What if we come in under our $45,000 goal:</strong></h2>
<p>If for some terrible reason we come in under the $45,000 goal, Gazetta has worked it out with our developers so that we can develop and launch our app and website in multiple phases.  This will give you piece of mind that your money will go strictly towards the development even if the entire goal is not reached.  Then, when more funds become available, the additional customized functions and interactivity can be added and launched.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Keep it going!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Help spread the word about Gazetta to all your friends and family so we can spread the news starting this year.  Every dollar counts!</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to further help:</strong></p>
<p>-Ask to be a Gazetta Campaign Manager by emailing us at <a href=""mailto:kyle@gazettanews.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">kyle@gazettanews.com</a> and get a Campaign Managers packet to help you spread the word</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for your contribution and helping make this happen!</p>
<p> </p></div>","Just upload your pictures and videos that you think could be newsworthy through the Gazetta app and go about your day.  An hour later you could find $20, $40 or even $100 deposited to your account.  Gazetta markets your pictures and videos to every local, regional and national news organization in the country.  If it sells to be used in an online news story, you get paid.  The Gazetta app and website will be interactive and allow you to manage your pictures & videos, browse, and follow other current events in your area in real time.  Lets say you hear sirens near your house one night, just check the Gazetta app for current events in your area and find out exactly what is happening.
We need your help in developing the free app and website.  Any contribution helps and will go directly towards development of all the features listed. Please take a minute to donate a small amount and lets start making a difference this year!
 
Our goals:
-Help rebuild our local and regional news sources
-Create credible news media for distribution at affordable rates
-Create jobs across the nation
-Help the public keep up with current events in real time
-Give everyone the chance to bring pressing issues to light in a new way
-Get people paid for their newsworthy pictures and videos, instead of letting the news organizations take them for free
 
How Gazetta can create jobs in your area and more credible news sources in our country:
Nearly 130,000 jobs were lost in the news industry in the past decade.  Countless local and regional newspapers have shutdown because they couldn’t make the shift from print to online.  The news sources in our nation have severely dwindled, limiting the amount of credible information that we receive.  Gazetta can help create jobs all over America for journalists, fact checkers and entire online news businesses by providing low-cost local and regional news media and news leads for online editorial use.
 
Why we need your help:
Simple fact is we can't do this alone, and what would be the fun in that. So we figured what better way to develop the free app and website then let everyone get to be a part of it.  Just a $15 donation from 3000 people would fully fund us!
The goal amount of $45,000 will allow Gazetta to fully develop and launch our mobile app for both iPhone and Android, the custom ecommerce auction website, the Gazetta News website and a social media integration app.  All of the key features and interactivity listed in this write-up will be part of Gazetta's app and website launch.  Below is a breakdown of the costs:
Mobile app (iPhone, Android):.............$6,350
Ecommerce website:.........................$27,000
Gazetta News website:......................$3,000
Social media integration:....................$5,500
Indiegogo and fees:...........................$3,150
                               Total:................$45,000

<p>The Solarie Technologie
Charging Station is an off-grid portable, compact and easy-to-use SOLAR powered
alternative to the traditional gas generator. Our team is real and serious about getting it into our neighborhoods in times of disaster. </p>
<p><b>Solar Power is the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Power!</b></p>
<p><b>The Story</b></p>
<p>Climate change is
happening.<span>  Natural disasters are
consistently reported across the United States. 
They are occurring at an increasing rate causing
power outages nationwide.  These
disasters combined with aging infrastructures call for change in the way we
obtain our electricity. <br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/833856/files/20140904085257-Capture.PNG?1409845977"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/835196/files/20140904210738-Major_Power_Outages.png?1409890058"" src="""" style=""width: 574.821px; height: 441px;""/></p><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p><b>Why Solar Power?<br/><br/></b>
<p>The traditional gas generator
is the leading cause of carbon monoxide deaths in the U.S.<span>  Gas is expensive and a hassle to get
especially in a disaster. </span></p>
<p>Solar power is clean, safe
and free.<span>  To get electricity from our
Charging Station, all you need to do is roll it into a patch of sunshine!</span></p>
<p><b>Be a part of the Solar Revolution.<span>  </span></b></p>
<p>It is up to us to become
RESILIENT in these changing times.<span>  With <b>YOUR</b> support and our team of experts, our
Charging Station will reconnect communications, restart daily functions and
light the darkness turning a situation from crisis to relief. Please help us
make this happen before another huge wave of natural disasters strike.  </span></p>
<p>Our goal is to equip disaster
relief organizations with these Charging Stations to provide electricity
immediately to those left in the wake of a disaster. Your neighborhood could be next, help us prepare now. <br/></p>

<p><b>Why we need your help and what we will do with your contribution:</b></p>
<p>We are in our final stage of product development. We need to buy more parts to build several demonstration samples and ship them out to the field with relief organizations (American Red Cross, Salvation Army, emergency management) for field testing. We have approval for testing with the American Red Cross at the end of September. From the feedback we will redesign and build a better prototype for their needs.  With the final prototype,  we'll get our very costly engineering validation (UL certification). Finally, legal fees will need to be covered to get us to market.  </p>
<p><b>Naming Contest!!!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>People are always throwing ideas to us to name our solar Charging Station but we wanted to reserve this privilege and fun for you.  As soon as you become a contributor, we'll send you an email. We’d love to
hear your ideas! For it to be a viable
candidate, there can’t be any other solar products that have the same name.
We’ll take the top 20 ideas and send out a survey to all contributors to get a
vote for the final five. Make your mark on the solar revolution.
The final 5 will all receive a surprise perk  at  the $200 contribution
level. </p>
<p><b>Our Team</b></p>
<p>Our team and advisors are people who are passionate about clean energy (75+ years of solar industry experience combined) including solar pioneer, Scott Carlson (former VP Real Goods Solar), Jim Krieg (designer of largest solar carports in the US, SunWize) and Professor Robert Morris (Professor Emeritus State University of New York). </p>
<br/><p>Risks and challenges:</p>
<p>We have worked around the
clock and sweated in our body weight, but here are a few things we see as
risks:</p>
<p>Manufacturing: </p>
<p>Designed and devoted to
manufacturing in the United States, creating the Solarie Technologie Charging
Station is expensive and requires the expertise of a team of people to get it
right including field testing with disaster relief organizations and
Underwriter’s Laboratory certification.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Product Adjustments:</p>
<p>As we call up disaster victims and those
involved with the emergency relief process, we will make some  adjustments
to improve the final product.<span>  These
changes are to accommodate the needs of our users as they become apparent to
us.  We will let you know of the changes
and how it will benefit the users in the wake of a disaster. </span></p>
<p>Fulfillment: </p>
<p>There are circumstances
beyond our control that could cause a delay.<span> 
These circumstances could include UL validation, a machine breaking down, faulty
equipment or a shipment getting lost. <br/></span></p>

</div></div>","The Solarie Technologie
Charging Station is an off-grid portable, compact and easy-to-use SOLAR powered
alternative to the traditional gas generator. Our team is real and serious about getting it into our neighborhoods in times of disaster. 
Solar Power is the 21st Century Power!
The Story
Climate change is
happening.  Natural disasters are
consistently reported across the United States. 
They are occurring at an increasing rate causing
power outages nationwide.  These
disasters combined with aging infrastructures call for change in the way we
obtain our electricity. 

Why Solar Power?
The traditional gas generator
is the leading cause of carbon monoxide deaths in the U.S.  Gas is expensive and a hassle to get
especially in a disaster. 
Solar power is clean, safe
and free.  To get electricity from our
Charging Station, all you need to do is roll it into a patch of sunshine!
Be a part of the Solar Revolution.  
It is up to us to become
RESILIENT in these changing times.  With YOUR support and our team of experts, our
Charging Station will reconnect communications, restart daily functions and
light the darkness turning a situation from crisis to relief. Please help us
make this happen before another huge wave of natural disasters strike.  
Our goal is to equip disaster
relief organizations with these Charging Stations to provide electricity
immediately to those left in the wake of a disaster. Your neighborhood could be next, help us prepare now.

Rewards:


Why we need your help and what we will do with your contribution:
We are in our final stage of product development. We need to buy more parts to build several demonstration samples and ship them out to the field with relief organizations (American Red Cross, Salvation Army, emergency management) for field testing. We have approval for testing with the American Red Cross at the end of September. From the feedback we will redesign and build a better prototype for their needs.  With the final prototype,  we'll get our very costly engineering validation (UL certification). Finally, legal fees will need to be covered to get us to market.  
Naming Contest!!!

People are always throwing ideas to us to name our solar Charging Station but we wanted to reserve this privilege and fun for you.  As soon as you become a contributor, we'll send you an email. We’d love to
hear your ideas! For it to be a viable
candidate, there can’t be any other solar products that have the same name.
We’ll take the top 20 ideas and send out a survey to all contributors to get a
vote for the final five. Make your mark on the solar revolution.
The final 5 will all receive a surprise perk  at  the $200 contribution
level. 
Our Team
Our team and advisors are people who are passionate about clean energy (75+ years of solar industry experience combined) including solar pioneer, Scott Carlson (former VP Real Goods Solar), Jim Krieg (designer of largest solar carports in the US, SunWize) and Professor Robert Morris (Professor Emeritus State University of New York). 
Risks and challenges:
We have worked around the
clock and sweated in our body weight, but here are a few things we see as
risks:
Manufacturing: 
Designed and devoted to
manufacturing in the United States, creating the Solarie Technologie Charging
Station is expensive and requires the expertise of a team of people to get it
right including field testing with disaster relief organizations and
Underwriter’s Laboratory certification.  
Product Adjustments:
As we call up disaster victims and those
involved with the emergency relief process, we will make some  adjustments
to improve the final product.  These
changes are to accommodate the needs of our users as they become apparent to
us.  We will let you know of the changes
and how it will benefit the users in the wake of a disaster. 
Fulfillment: 
There are circumstances
beyond our control that could cause a delay. 
These circumstances could include UL validation, a machine breaking down, faulty
equipment or a shipment getting lost. 
THANK YOU!

<p>Carrying two phones is not convenient! It is not fashionable or stylish; it costs a lot and is a waste of space.That's why we created PIECE!! PIECE is the future of Dual SIM technology. It is a tiny companion device that holds any GSM, EGSM, DCS, or PCS card, allowing you to add an extra number to your existing smart device via bluetooth. It is designed to fit in your wallet, front pocket, or behind your phone easily. PIECE is so small that it is only the size of a CREDIT CARD! That's why we like to call it, ""The Next Small Thing""</p>

</div>","Carrying two phones is not convenient! It is not fashionable or stylish; it costs a lot and is a waste of space.That's why we created PIECE!! PIECE is the future of Dual SIM technology. It is a tiny companion device that holds any GSM, EGSM, DCS, or PCS card, allowing you to add an extra number to your existing smart device via bluetooth. It is designed to fit in your wallet, front pocket, or behind your phone easily. PIECE is so small that it is only the size of a CREDIT CARD! That's why we like to call it, ""The Next Small Thing""


The design of PIECE is simple and match your phone nicely.


It designed to be super slim, and easily fit in your wallet.


Long lasting battery which can provide up to 150 hours stand by time, so you only have to charge PIECE once a while.


Insert you working number in PIECE, and start making phone calls and text messages. Enjoy your day with only one phone.


 PIECE is compatible with almost all of the IOS device via Bluetooth.


 iOS and Android Compatible - With the stretch goal reached! PIECE is now smart device friendly








「PIECE」--iPod touchにも対応 

This credit card-sized Bluetooth device gives your phone a second number

 The PIECE is an innovative and multi functional SIM adapter that is the same size as a credit card

 아이팟 터치를 전화기로 바꿔보자

 香港團隊設計！PIECE SIM 卡轉插器可將 iPad 及 iPod touch 變成智能手機




 A special iOS app lets you manage the Piece SIM, turning your iPhone in a dual SIM device. 

 Вы можете вставить в Piece любую SIM-карту и подключить его к телефону под управлением iOS или Android по беспроводному соединению Bluetooth. 





Now you can have two number active at the same time. Simply put your other number into PIECE and using Bluetooth connect to your phone. Both numbers can now be used on your one and only phone.


Matching your phone in style! We build 2 standard colors for you to match your phone, so you can wear PIECE with style and become a conversation starter with your friends


Not just a SIM card adapter, PIECE is also a security alert for your wallet. If you and PIECE are separated by more than 10m (30feet), both your phone and PIECE will ring to prevent it from being lost or stolen


Can't find your wallet in your room or in a car? No worries, we got you covered! By using the PIECE app you can make PIECE ring. From now on finding your wallet is super simple.


Likewise, by using the function key on the edge of PIECE, you can make your phone ring so it will always be easier to find.

<h3>Emo-Active</h3>
<p>(version francaise disponible via l'onglet Mises a Jours)</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">Emo-Active helps you control domotic devices by thoughts only.</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">It aims to develop an accessibility system to be used on smartphones (iPhone, Android).</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">Its intended goal is to provide people with physical limitations better computer control, as well as enhanced socialization capabilities.</p>
<p>The proposed system is based upon EEG acquisition, using commercially available components. </p>
</div>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Problem</span></h3>
<div>
<p class=""FreeForm"">People with heavy physical disabilities face severe problems due to the lack of possibilities for socialization.

(version francaise disponible via l'onglet Mises a Jours)
Emo-Active helps you control domotic devices by thoughts only.
It aims to develop an accessibility system to be used on smartphones (iPhone, Android).
Its intended goal is to provide people with physical limitations better computer control, as well as enhanced socialization capabilities.
The proposed system is based upon EEG acquisition, using commercially available components. 

The Problem

People with heavy physical disabilities face severe problems due to the lack of possibilities for socialization. As our world evolves, new technologies become increasingly part of the basic ways that social and professional living is accomplished. The evolution of those technologies makes the world more complicated in terms of accessibility. The lack of accessibility segregates disabled people from the community.
People with locked-in syndrome and people with severe motor disablement constitute a small part of the public concern for accessibility. The reduction of certain physical capabilities, such as color-blindness, deafness, blindness have been addressed by the traditional use of the technological environment, and have been well covered by accessibility solutions like Lynx, Jaws, and of course well designed HTML and CSS coding.
The current accessibility solutions available to people with severe physical disabilities share common characteristics: they are expensive, use some kind of code (such as Morse code), and have to be custom fitted in most cases. Another challenge the target group faces is the lack of socialization. When an individual has limited abilities to communicate thoughts and emotions, the absence of positive socialization may be detrimental to those suffering the disability.
The Solution
The purpose of the project is to increase the socialization of people having difficulties using their hands, or unable to use other body language to convey emotions. More specifically the project is designed to better assist those with quadriplegia, cerebral palsy, locked-in syndrome, and similar disabilities.
Such an enhanced socialization may be achieved by two means:
First, by giving system users explicit access to the technological services common to the non-disabled, especially environment control such as lighting and climatisation, television and on-demand media.
Second, by improving the communication between the user and their dearest, with real-time representation of a user’s emotions.
The Emo-Activ system is designed to use standard computer resources offering virtual independence from disabilities affecting individual users.

<p>We've all been there:  It's time to chop the vegetables for a home

<p>VMatter Cutlery is introducing the first amorphous alloy blade to the knife market. James Kang, VMatter's CEO, has been working toward bringing VMatter (amorphous alloy) to the world since he first experienced it in a lab at Caltech over twenty years ago. However, when one of his employees told him that the knife he had fashioned out of VMatter five years prior had never gotten dull, James thought about the properties of VMatter that made this possible, and the idea for VMatter cutlery was born.</p>

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p><font size=""4""><b>Why VMatter knives are superior.</b></font></p>
<p>Why do steel knives get dull?  Steel knifes can get dull mainly in two ways, both through actual use and from corrosion.  The edge of a
steel knife is microscopically thin. Contrary to the popular notion that knives become dull because the edge wears off, what actually happens is that the edge folds over onto itself in the food-cutting process. In fact, microscopic pieces of the the knife edge can even break off.  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The other way steel knives get dull is through corrosion.  Again, this happens at a microscopic level, so it is usually not seen.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">VMatter knives don't suffer from these limitations.  VMatter is so elastic that the knife edge never folds over in normal use.  Since VMatter is a metallic glass, it doesn't corrode, whether sitting in a drawer, knife block, or even being washed in a dishwasher.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Some people are concerned that having a sharp knife is unsafe.  Actually, the opposite is true.  Besides being a pleasure to
use because it does what you intend it to do, a sharp knife is easier to control and cuts where you want it to cut.  A dull knife often requires more effort and can move or slip, possibly resulting in injury.</p>

Challenge Rx is: 

A FREE workout programming and tracking software with advanced workout metrics to track athlete power output.


To interpret these metrics into actionable information we have enlisted the help of Mobility WOD coach Andrew Killion.


There is also a competitive interface in Challenge Rx where CrossFit Level 1 Trainers with Crossfit Judges course credentials earn $5 for every workout video they judge.


Challenge Rx will also host competitions which are based around a charitable cause where 100% of the purse will be passed through to a specific organization.

For our competitive interface, we level the playing field by using a power output formula for athlete skill level assessment which will only allow athletes with similar power output to compete against each other!  The days of being shorter, taller, or skinnier being EXCUSES for sucking at burpees etc… are gone.  Our proprietary physics formula takes height, weight, leg length, arm length into account in the calculation.                                         Feel free to email questions to:                                             Info@ChallengeRx.com

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our goal is </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">to support what we call the<a href=""https://medium.com/@robinjewsbury/the-missing-3-4b-internet-users-8140789825cb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> missing 3.4 billion people</a> who will start using smartphones in the next 5 years and will not have access to PCs. These people will be coming from the developing world.   We believe western developers have missed this opportunity - probably because it's hard to make money in the developing world at the moment.  But its the huge number of an extra 3.4B which is motivating us - you don't have to make much from 1 user if you have billions of users - this is our dream.</span><br/></p>
<p>We have some history in this area.  We developed a product call EyeMags which has been live since 2007 - this is the heart of the app building technology used by Appies - our apps run on <b>all</b> phones even cheap $20 phones with small screens.  This service had a significant take up in India and Indonesia but relied on the app creator having a PC.  It was the realisation that these users needed to be able to create Apps from the phone that motivated us to create Appies.  We also have a history in app development.  We created the first Flash based smartphone apps in 2005 which won awards for its innovative UI and at the time was adopted by the BBC as their news and weather app - it even did push notifications before Apple ""invented"" them 3 years later.  We've continued with our interest in creating beautiful gesture driven UIs and Appies uses these features.  Appies runs on iOS and Android only, but increasingly the domination of Android as the smartphone of choice in the developing world will (hopefully) bring us the 3.4B users we seek.  Also the viral distribution feature that the apps created and shared run on<b> all </b>phones will mean we get adopted as quickly as technically possible. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Our goal is to support what we call the missing 3.4 billion people who will start using smartphones in the next 5 years and will not have access to PCs. These people will be coming from the developing world.   We believe western developers have missed this opportunity - probably because it's hard to make money in the developing world at the moment.  But its the huge number of an extra 3.4B which is motivating us - you don't have to make much from 1 user if you have billions of users - this is our dream.
We have some history in this area.  We developed a product call EyeMags which has been live since 2007 - this is the heart of the app building technology used by Appies - our apps run on all phones even cheap $20 phones with small screens.  This service had a significant take up in India and Indonesia but relied on the app creator having a PC.  It was the realisation that these users needed to be able to create Apps from the phone that motivated us to create Appies.  We also have a history in app development.  We created the first Flash based smartphone apps in 2005 which won awards for its innovative UI and at the time was adopted by the BBC as their news and weather app - it even did push notifications before Apple ""invented"" them 3 years later.  We've continued with our interest in creating beautiful gesture driven UIs and Appies uses these features.  Appies runs on iOS and Android only, but increasingly the domination of Android as the smartphone of choice in the developing world will (hopefully) bring us the 3.4B users we seek.  Also the viral distribution feature that the apps created and shared run on all phones will mean we get adopted as quickly as technically possible. 
   What We Need & What You Get The first version of Appies is complete as alpha/beta test download from both Google Play and iTunes Appstore.   For iTunes you need to have iOS8 and for now we'd recommend Android 4.2 or above only.
So what do we want from you and what do you get out of it:  We want you to tell us if we've missed something from the app and if indeed the app works on all versions of phone and in all circumstances. It sounds big headed I know, but we really believe we are creating something big here and you can be part of that effort from the beginning.  Your name will appear in the founding users section of our Facebook page and if indeed we do make it big you will be able to say you were part of it and helped create it - if you contribute to it it will become your product which you can be proud of. We're not trying to get huge amounts of money; we are trying to get huge numbers of users.  You will be part of the initial founding users who will be ambassadors for the app creating the seeds for the viral worldwide campaign. We will use the money to help in the marketing for the app worldwide.    The Impact In the developing world today content creation is only for the rich few who have PCs.  We want Appies to take its part in allowing billions of ordinary people create content for the Internet.  In these countries content consumption will be 99% on phones and content creation will increasingly be from the phone itself - we want Appies to be at the center of this fundamental change.  For this reason the App will be free and users will get an allocation of apps free per month (initially this will be 10 but this will reduce this with time) so as many people as possible get free usage.  We will then charge small amounts for additional apps in order to fund the service.
Risks & Challenges
 There are risks and challenges to this work.  Google and Apple are the gatekeepers to the App stores.  They could ban us if we contravene their rules.  We don't believe we do and indeed the beta App has passed Apple's App review in order to get published as a beta app for TestFlight.  This does not guarantee the app as it is will get published though and this remains a risk.

<p>Our team is lead by serial entrepreneurs who have started and built successful software and internet businesses over the years. In our latest venture, we have worked extremely hard over the last 2 years and personally invested over $100,000 of our own money and lots of blood, sweat and tears (well, maybe not the blood) to develop a radical, revolutionary social media app called <strong>PositiveTALK</strong> for Facebook and Twitter that we believe can <strong>CHANGE THE WORLD</strong> - now we need your support to launch <strong>PositiveTALK</strong> for Facebook and Twitter and help dramatically improve the lives of millions of people around the world!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Please Support Our Mission</h2>
<p><strong>The mission of PositiveTALK is to change the world in a positive way by operating the world’s first “social sentiment network”, connecting millions of people to positive friends, companies and brands on Facebook, Twitter and other leading social  networks.</strong> To achieve our mission, <strong>PositiveTALK</strong> develops and markets unique “big data” social sentiment apps for web and mobile devices that connect positive people together on leading social networks to help transform their lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Massive Problem We Are Solving</h2>
<p><strong>Negativity is a massive and growing problem today that affects BILLIONS of people, companies and brands worldwide. Studies indicate that the average person has over 60,000+ thoughts per day and the majority of these thoughts are NEGATIVE and REPETITIVE (80+% repetitive). In addition, the strong “negative bias” by the media for many years, combined with the explosive growth of the Internet, mobile devices and social networks has led to more that a 10x increase in the number of negative messages we and our family and friends are exposed to on a daily basis</strong>.</p>
<p>This rapid increase in negative thoughts, comments and online messages are having a dramatic negative effect on people’s lives, leading to increasing levels of social unrest, negative feelings, negative emotions, unhappiness, poor health, lack of wealth, and unfulfilling personal and business relationships.</p>
<p>PositiveTALK was developed to specifically address this massive and growing global problem. <strong>PositiveTALK is supported by the latest scientific research that indicates that</strong> i<strong>ncreasing the level of “positive sentiment” can have a significant POSITIVE IMPACT on a person’s health, wealth, relationships and happiness, and improve a person’s self esteem, relationships and influence with friends, family, co-workers and customers.</strong></p>

<h2>How Far Along is the Project Right Now?</h2>
<p>Over the last 2 years, our team of software engineers have been developing the backend software integrated with both Facebook and Twitter and developing the front-end web app as well. We began beta testing the <strong>PositiveTALK</strong> web app in October 2012 and our beta users really love this revolutionary app, and we are ready to launch the app in production in the next 30 days to a potential audience of over 1 billion active users on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>This is where your help comes in...your support will allow us to move PositiveTALK into production, including hosting the backend <strong>PositiveTALK</strong> servers on Amazon's AWS cloud server environment, which will allow us to run the app in a high performance, scaleable, redundant cloud server environment that can scale to support millions of users.</p>

<p> </p></div>","We Need Your Help to Change the World
Our team is lead by serial entrepreneurs who have started and built successful software and internet businesses over the years. In our latest venture, we have worked extremely hard over the last 2 years and personally invested over $100,000 of our own money and lots of blood, sweat and tears (well, maybe not the blood) to develop a radical, revolutionary social media app called PositiveTALK for Facebook and Twitter that we believe can CHANGE THE WORLD - now we need your support to launch PositiveTALK for Facebook and Twitter and help dramatically improve the lives of millions of people around the world!
 
Please Support Our Mission
The mission of PositiveTALK is to change the world in a positive way by operating the world’s first “social sentiment network”, connecting millions of people to positive friends, companies and brands on Facebook, Twitter and other leading social  networks. To achieve our mission, PositiveTALK develops and markets unique “big data” social sentiment apps for web and mobile devices that connect positive people together on leading social networks to help transform their lives.
 
The Massive Problem We Are Solving
Negativity is a massive and growing problem today that affects BILLIONS of people, companies and brands worldwide. Studies indicate that the average person has over 60,000+ thoughts per day and the majority of these thoughts are NEGATIVE and REPETITIVE (80+% repetitive). In addition, the strong “negative bias” by the media for many years, combined with the explosive growth of the Internet, mobile devices and social networks has led to more that a 10x increase in the number of negative messages we and our family and friends are exposed to on a daily basis.
This rapid increase in negative thoughts, comments and online messages are having a dramatic negative effect on people’s lives, leading to increasing levels of social unrest, negative feelings, negative emotions, unhappiness, poor health, lack of wealth, and unfulfilling personal and business relationships.
PositiveTALK was developed to specifically address this massive and growing global problem. PositiveTALK is supported by the latest scientific research that indicates that increasing the level of “positive sentiment” can have a significant POSITIVE IMPACT on a person’s health, wealth, relationships and happiness, and improve a person’s self esteem, relationships and influence with friends, family, co-workers and customers.

How Far Along is the Project Right Now?
Over the last 2 years, our team of software engineers have been developing the backend software integrated with both Facebook and Twitter and developing the front-end web app as well. We began beta testing the PositiveTALK web app in October 2012 and our beta users really love this revolutionary app, and we are ready to launch the app in production in the next 30 days to a potential audience of over 1 billion active users on Facebook and Twitter.
This is where your help comes in...your support will allow us to move PositiveTALK into production, including hosting the backend PositiveTALK servers on Amazon's AWS cloud server environment, which will allow us to run the app in a high performance, scaleable, redundant cloud server environment that can scale to support millions of users.

<h3>Overview and Introduction</h3>
<p>This laser is more than just a ""scuba-laser"" it is solid, ruggedized and ready for extreme environments.  It is designed to handle extreme dust, heavy vibration and shock and even can survive at vacuum pressure (i.e. Mars, Low Earth Orbit).  We have a passion for lasers and are in the early stages of creating a business dedicated to low cost rugged lasers for consumers and industry.</p>
<p>This effort is preliminary production run to build quantity of 100 laser modules.  This is the build to determine market viability of the product and prove out the product design before committing to a quantity of 1000 initial production lot build.  We will be making 50 available to funders and using another 40 to market to dive shops in the Dallas area and around the USA for retail sale.  We will be doing more testing of the last 10 to find any enhancements or improvements we can implement for the 1000 build in 2013.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""GL-012 SCUBA LASER UNDERWATER RUGGEDIZED LASER"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SXb0rX3kmn4/UFsQ373pgMI/AAAAAAAAAJI/jonnavhhlms/s265/laser-beam34.JPG"" src="""" style="""" title=""SCUBA-LASER.com GL-012""/></p>
<h3>Team</h3>
<p>Our engineering team is highlighted by our lead mechanical engineer, Eric, and our lead physicist, John.  Eric spent 15 years in the military/aerospace field designing flight ready lasers, infrared cameras and underwater devices.  Our lead laser physicist has over 30 years of experience in design of military lasers and other products, has 8 patents and holds a PhD in atmospheric physics.</p>
<h3>Technical Details</h3>
<p>The GL-012 Scuba-Laser is a 5mW 532nm green laser.  Our product is made in U.S.A., uses a standard CR123A battery similar to many of today's digital cameras and commercial night vision systems. </p>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Barrel is .93"" diameter</li>
<li>Front End .99"" diameter</li>
<li>Length 4.5""</li>
<li>5mW output power, Class IIIa</li>
<li>Green, 532nm wavelength</li>
<li>Aluminum housing w/ anodized finish</li>
<li>Shock Resistant</li>
<li>Operating Temp 10 C to 55 C</li>
<li>Storage Temp -10 C to 65 C</li>
<li>Passed 8 consecutive 6' drop shock tests</li>
<li>Passed Vibration Testing</li>
<li>Design to be non-toxic to the environment</li>
<li>Target Depth, 300 meters</li>
</ul>
<p>The laser is knob activated instead of the normal push-button found on lasers.  The knob at the back end is designed to be able to be grasped when using scuba gloves, or other gloves.  The knob also provides operation at depth without activation due to pressure.</p>
<h3>Laser Warning</h3>
<p>This is a Class IIIa laser, (&lt; 5mW).  It is still dangerous to point directly in someones eye(s).  Lasers in this class are dangerous in combination with optical instruments.  Direct contact with the eye for over two minutes may cause serious damage to the retina.  The device is required to come with a permanent warning label IAW FDA regulations.</p>
<p><img alt=""Laser Warning label"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-DjnYngKz_rs/UFk-M7qX3dI/AAAAAAAAAHE/dM9UrPFKhcE/w373-h272-n-k/laser-warning.PNG"" src="""" style="""" title=""Laser Warning label""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Fabrication and Prototypes</h3>
<p>We have made five prototypes machined on our own lathe.  Two of the prototypes are currently in the hands of divers for testing.  </p>
<p>Our prototypes were built in Dallas Texas.  The production machined parts will be built in a USA owned and operating machine shop. We will build and assemble the first 100 units in Dallas TX.  The full production runs will all be built in the USA.  We are dedicated to keeping manufacturing and assembly of our products in the USA. We are planning to build 1000 units in early 2013.</p>
<p><br/><img alt=""CAD rendered image of scuba laser"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NMqfLqwCwYw/UFlAZBiAlZI/AAAAAAAAAHc/8-nLLVSO8z8/w436-h204-n-k/GL-012_CAD912.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Scuba-Laser""/> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Prototypes and Environmental Tests</h3>
<p>We have passed the following tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 meter Depth for 1 week</li>
<li>5 minutes at 15 meters</li>
<li>8 consecutive 6 foot drops onto concrete</li>
<li>Vibration Testing</li>
<li>-10 to + 65 C Storage Temp</li>
<li>10 C to + 55 C Operational Temperature</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How Funds will be used &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds raised will go towards paying for the machined aluminum parts, the optics and all other hardware and laser components.  The funding would also cover costs for assembly fixtures and test equipment for depth testing and laser output energy testing for FDA approval.  </p>
<p>Additionally, if enough money is raised, we will need to print instruction manuals, buy shipping material and print product datasheets to go with the product. </p>
<p>If we go beyond our goal, we will be donating a portion to some of our selected charities.  Our charities have been reviewed to ensure they are respectable and have high ratings with the Better Business Bureau and other charity review websites.</p>
<h3>PERKS</h3>
<p>Some of the funding is used for perks.  We have picked some perks related to optics which we think are kind of cool.  We are also offering a few other perks and the laser itself at a low introductory cost.  The MSRP will be $137, but we are offering it here for the intro price of $89.</p>
<p>For our lower level funding we will have a portion of your funds go to one of our selected charities to help protect the oceans, rivers and their inhabitants.</p>

<h3>
<br/>I like the laser but I don't scuba-dive!?!</h3>
<p>So, Scuba-Lasers aren't just for scuba diving anymore.  You can use it for anything you need a ruggedized lase.  Any application that requires a laser which will not leak when dropped in a puddle, exposed to rain, dunked in a tank or whatever other adventure in life will expose it to water, liquids, vibration or shock.  This laser can take quite a beating, so if you are need a laser for an application where it will potentially experience a rough ride, be exposed to shock or occasionally dropped whether accidentally or on purpose then this laser may fit your needs.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Overview and Introduction
This laser is more than just a ""scuba-laser"" it is solid, ruggedized and ready for extreme environments.  It is designed to handle extreme dust, heavy vibration and shock and even can survive at vacuum pressure (i.e. Mars, Low Earth Orbit).  We have a passion for lasers and are in the early stages of creating a business dedicated to low cost rugged lasers for consumers and industry.
This effort is preliminary production run to build quantity of 100 laser modules.  This is the build to determine market viability of the product and prove out the product design before committing to a quantity of 1000 initial production lot build.  We will be making 50 available to funders and using another 40 to market to dive shops in the Dallas area and around the USA for retail sale.  We will be doing more testing of the last 10 to find any enhancements or improvements we can implement for the 1000 build in 2013.
 

Team
Our engineering team is highlighted by our lead mechanical engineer, Eric, and our lead physicist, John.  Eric spent 15 years in the military/aerospace field designing flight ready lasers, infrared cameras and underwater devices.  Our lead laser physicist has over 30 years of experience in design of military lasers and other products, has 8 patents and holds a PhD in atmospheric physics.
Technical Details
The GL-012 Scuba-Laser is a 5mW 532nm green laser.  Our product is made in U.S.A., uses a standard CR123A battery similar to many of today's digital cameras and commercial night vision systems. 
Features:

Barrel is .93"" diameter
Front End .99"" diameter
Length 4.5""
5mW output power, Class IIIa
Green, 532nm wavelength
Aluminum housing w/ anodized finish
Shock Resistant
Operating Temp 10 C to 55 C
Storage Temp -10 C to 65 C
Passed 8 consecutive 6' drop shock tests
Passed Vibration Testing
Design to be non-toxic to the environment
Target Depth, 300 meters

The laser is knob activated instead of the normal push-button found on lasers.  The knob at the back end is designed to be able to be grasped when using scuba gloves, or other gloves.  The knob also provides operation at depth without activation due to pressure.
Laser Warning
This is a Class IIIa laser, (< 5mW).  It is still dangerous to point directly in someones eye(s).  Lasers in this class are dangerous in combination with optical instruments.  Direct contact with the eye for over two minutes may cause serious damage to the retina.  The device is required to come with a permanent warning label IAW FDA regulations.

 
Fabrication and Prototypes
We have made five prototypes machined on our own lathe.  Two of the prototypes are currently in the hands of divers for testing.  
Our prototypes were built in Dallas Texas.  The production machined parts will be built in a USA owned and operating machine shop. We will build and assemble the first 100 units in Dallas TX.  The full production runs will all be built in the USA.  We are dedicated to keeping manufacturing and assembly of our products in the USA. We are planning to build 1000 units in early 2013.
 
 
Prototypes and Environmental Tests
We have passed the following tests:

3 meter Depth for 1 week
5 minutes at 15 meters
8 consecutive 6 foot drops onto concrete
Vibration Testing
-10 to + 65 C Storage Temp
10 C to + 55 C Operational Temperature

 


How Funds will be used & What You Get
The funds raised will go towards paying for the machined aluminum parts, the optics and all other hardware and laser components.  The funding would also cover costs for assembly fixtures and test equipment for depth testing and laser output energy testing for FDA approval.  
Additionally, if enough money is raised, we will need to print instruction manuals, buy shipping material and print product datasheets to go with the product. 
If we go beyond our goal, we will be donating a portion to some of our selected charities.  Our charities have been reviewed to ensure they are respectable and have high ratings with the Better Business Bureau and other charity review websites.
PERKS
Some of the funding is used for perks.  We have picked some perks related to optics which we think are kind of cool.  We are also offering a few other perks and the laser itself at a low introductory cost.  The MSRP will be $137, but we are offering it here for the intro price of $89.
For our lower level funding we will have a portion of your funds go to one of our selected charities to help protect the oceans, rivers and their inhabitants.

I like the laser but I don't scuba-dive!?!
So, Scuba-Lasers aren't just for scuba diving anymore.  You can use it for anything you need a ruggedized lase.  Any application that requires a laser which will not leak when dropped in a puddle, exposed to rain, dunked in a tank or whatever other adventure in life will expose it to water, liquids, vibration or shock.  This laser can take quite a beating, so if you are need a laser for an application where it will potentially experience a rough ride, be exposed to shock or occasionally dropped whether accidentally or on purpose then this laser may fit your needs.

<h2>Element and day/night iAtomic Watches</h2>
<h3><strong>Element watches:</strong></h3>
<p>The development of our element watches is inspired by four elements in the universe, conveying the meaning that we are all connected together by wearing our watches just like these elements coexist and maintain in harmony.</p>
<p><strong>Air, Earth, Water and Fire Elements</strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8390/8611347143_67510ce82f_z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3><strong>Day and Night watches:</strong></h3>
<p>The “Day and Night” concept literally reflects itself on the color. White stands for the Day watch, and black for the Night one. Not only do the Day and Night uni-sex watches convey the meaning of eliminating gender discrimination, but also they symbolize the treasured feelings we harbor day and night towards our loved ones.</p>
<p><em>It has left our mind in open imagination about the things we might genuinely care about day and night. It might lead us to the sacred vow of loving our wife or husband day and night. It would probably remind us of the sweet memories we have with our boyfriend or girlfriend day and night. And it can also be the friendship we cherish back when we were still in university. Day and night, this watch presents the most accurate time. Day and night, we move on from the past, carrying with important memories, happiness or sorrow. It would be cool to have a watch like this on our wrist to help us catch up with time and help us remember the things and people we care about.</em></p>

<h2><strong>How does the watch work?</strong></h2>
<p>The i-Atomic watch concept relies on 2 technologies, a photo synchronizing system and a self-synchronizing microchip. And they are both SELF-DEVELOPED!<br/><br/><img alt=""PCB"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/431967_10152159918586992_1826567069_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""PCB""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Steps involved to complete the synchronization:</p>
<p>1. Open the free App/Software</p>
<p>2. Place the watch in front of your mobile device (iOS, Android, Windows mobile) or computer screen.</p>
<p>3. The watch finally confirms the synchronization by a sound notification, displaying the most accurate time, a Microsecond accurate to within millisecond.</p>
<p>The best part of this is that YOU synchornize your watch while wearing it and walking. </p>
<p>No wifi, no bluetooth, no cable, no RF, no charging… But it offers you very accrurate time.</p>
<h2><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/181/644/01f89ff3e6f73f35ccf703d0dbc66af1_large.png?1348786802"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<h2>The app/software Time Calibrator</h2>
<p>The Atomtime App/Software has been specifically designed to deliver the most accurate time information to all people in cities around the globe. Once the App is downloaded on the mobile device/computer, it connects automatically to the atomic clock server in Switzerland to display the exact local time and date. Through the quantum technology the information travels in speed of light from the NTP server to the AtomTime watches.</p>

<h2>Why did we start this project?</h2>
<p>We believe many of you have encountered accuracy problems with your watch as it was not as accurate as your Phone or Pad. As time goes by, we’ve become used to trusting our phone over our watch whenever we needed to check time. Disappointed at the quality of the usual watch concerning its accuracy control, our team got inspired to come up with an idea which was to design a simply accurate watch!</p>
<p>Hence, the project was started, aiming to develop the accurate watch. Our motivation was fuelled by the joy of seeing everyone rely on his watch for the precise time instead of the phones. </p>
<p>Years of research and development are both time-consuming and costly, which was not a problem because it is a project which we are heart over heals passionate about. Nevertheless, we wish to engage more people in this project as we know your participation will make a bigger difference!</p>
<p>Life is changing within a blink, making every second valuable. With a little generous help from you, we can make it possible to catch as well as control every second of your life!  Fund this project! Fund every precise second of your life! And we won’t forget to send you a cool watch!</p>

Element and day/night iAtomic Watches
Element watches:
The development of our element watches is inspired by four elements in the universe, conveying the meaning that we are all connected together by wearing our watches just like these elements coexist and maintain in harmony.
Air, Earth, Water and Fire Elements




Day and Night watches:
The “Day and Night” concept literally reflects itself on the color. White stands for the Day watch, and black for the Night one. Not only do the Day and Night uni-sex watches convey the meaning of eliminating gender discrimination, but also they symbolize the treasured feelings we harbor day and night towards our loved ones.
It has left our mind in open imagination about the things we might genuinely care about day and night. It might lead us to the sacred vow of loving our wife or husband day and night. It would probably remind us of the sweet memories we have with our boyfriend or girlfriend day and night. And it can also be the friendship we cherish back when we were still in university. Day and night, this watch presents the most accurate time. Day and night, we move on from the past, carrying with important memories, happiness or sorrow. It would be cool to have a watch like this on our wrist to help us catch up with time and help us remember the things and people we care about.

How does the watch work?
The i-Atomic watch concept relies on 2 technologies, a photo synchronizing system and a self-synchronizing microchip. And they are both SELF-DEVELOPED!
 
Steps involved to complete the synchronization:
1. Open the free App/Software
2. Place the watch in front of your mobile device (iOS, Android, Windows mobile) or computer screen.
3. The watch finally confirms the synchronization by a sound notification, displaying the most accurate time, a Microsecond accurate to within millisecond.
The best part of this is that YOU synchornize your watch while wearing it and walking. 
No wifi, no bluetooth, no cable, no RF, no charging… But it offers you very accrurate time.

The app/software Time Calibrator
The Atomtime App/Software has been specifically designed to deliver the most accurate time information to all people in cities around the globe. Once the App is downloaded on the mobile device/computer, it connects automatically to the atomic clock server in Switzerland to display the exact local time and date. Through the quantum technology the information travels in speed of light from the NTP server to the AtomTime watches.
Available on iOS, Android and Windows. ( APP)
 
Software ( Windows/MAC)


Why did we start this project?
We believe many of you have encountered accuracy problems with your watch as it was not as accurate as your Phone or Pad. As time goes by, we’ve become used to trusting our phone over our watch whenever we needed to check time. Disappointed at the quality of the usual watch concerning its accuracy control, our team got inspired to come up with an idea which was to design a simply accurate watch!
Hence, the project was started, aiming to develop the accurate watch. Our motivation was fuelled by the joy of seeing everyone rely on his watch for the precise time instead of the phones. 
Years of research and development are both time-consuming and costly, which was not a problem because it is a project which we are heart over heals passionate about. Nevertheless, we wish to engage more people in this project as we know your participation will make a bigger difference!
Life is changing within a blink, making every second valuable. With a little generous help from you, we can make it possible to catch as well as control every second of your life!  Fund this project! Fund every precise second of your life! And we won’t forget to send you a cool watch!

 What we need
We are hoping to raise 50,000 USD in order to be able to:
-          Start production
-          Promote campaign
-          Make the watches available worldwide
Together we can make every second valuable and measurable!

Not yet, we currently working on the Analogue version of i-Atomic watches, please Stay up to date with our progress: sign up: @ www.atomtime-watches.com
 
7. Can you help me understand the water resistance and ATM?



1 ATM:  10 Meters  or 33 Feet
A watch with this resistance level is protected against accidental exposure to water; for example, splashes, perspiration or accidental immersion. It should not be exposed to any water pressure.




3 ATM: 30 Meters or 100 Feet
This level will easily withstand splashes or brief immersion in water, or getting caught in the rain. However, it is not sufficiently resistant for swimming or bathing.




5 ATM : 50 Meters or 165 Feet
A watch with this level of resistance is wearable around household sinks, while playing sports and while swimming in shallow water. Do not wear it while bathing, snorkelling or scuba diving.




10 ATM : 100 Meters or 330 Feet
This level of water resistance will allow a watch to be worn around household sinks, while playing sports and while swimming or poolside diving. Do not wear it while scuba diving


Water resistance is tested in measurements of atmosphere (ATM). Each ATM denotes 10 meters of static water pressure. All our i-Atomic watches have 100 water-resistant ability.
8. Can I customize my iAtomic Watch?
With the added perk now you can choose and create your own iAtomic watch, choose from 4 Sillicone bands, 4 plated bezel, 4 dial colours.  Limited version and offered only on indiegogo.",47.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> My name is Steve Archambault and I am from Victoria BC Canada.  I work at a private golf course on the grounds crew. I came up with an invention around 2 plus yrs ago...an innovation to the aluminum beverage can.  I came to realize soon into my research and development just how the beverage industry can change the world. </p>
<p>  I dont believe the world needs anymore wealthy people.  The world needs more people that care about the one thing we all share...EARTH. The direction we are going it will not matter how much money you have in the bank and the wealth you have gained if there is no planet left.  That is why I plan on donating majority of my royalties to charity and once Ive established myself I plan on donating 100% of my royalties from my invention to charity.</p>
<p>  I am in the process of establishing a foundation called Uniting the World Foundation and through my invention and the app i am developing i have the potential to do just that....UNITE the WORLD.</p>
<p>The app that I am developing is what will make my invention and foundation completely interactive. It has several cool features such as being a platform for the users of the app to actually be part of the foundation and being invoved in the decision making and voting process.  The app isnt a game but more like a tool but at the same time making it fun for the user.  It offers solutions to making more ethical choices in your day to day life and also ways to reduce your carbon foot print.</p>
<p>  Not only that but it also creates a platform for ethical companies who meet the criteria to actually call themselves ethical to be featured on the app allowing the user/consumer to make the most ethical choice when purchasing a product. </p>
<p> Thats just the tip of the iceberg.  There are many more features and I could type for hours getting into every detail about the app but this summary gives you an idea as to what this app will do.  Its meant to empower you giving you control as to how the money the foundation generates from MY royalties from my invention is dispersed.</p>
<p> Its all about transparency and I will have the most transparent organization on the planet.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because I feel we wont leave anything left for future generations with the direction we are heading.  We need solutions to address the most pressing issues we are faced with globally. Your contribution how ever small or large it may be will help in creating one of the worlds largest organizations.  An organization which YOU the user will be in control of and you the contributer made possible. </p>
<p> The possibilities will be endless and once the game starts it will go on forever.  The big opportunity for all the contributors is they will have built a legacy for themselves and thats possible because of 1 fact....YOU built it.  To say you all are part in building this amazing project is something you can look back on and say we changed the world! There is no limit as to how big this can be...its up to you and thats because its all of you making it happen. I posted a youtube vid of a kick ass band June Fiasco and the song i posted pretty much sums it up. "" I think it's time I shed this skin, I've spent my whole life living in, This twisted self-inflicted suffering - Andrew Spark of the June Fiasco"" To me thats a really profound line and thats the reality we are living...twisted self inflicted suffering. </p>
<p>  This campaign has almost reached the half way point and I have a LONG way to go to reach my goal. With the help of social media we can make it happen sooner.  Lets spread the word and get this viral.  A different world is possible people and this app WILL change your life and the world.  No need to fight the existing reality when all we have to do is create a new one which makes the old one obsolete. You can either play or sit and wach from the sidelines. Either way its going to happen its just a matter if you want to play or not...Peace!</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p> I am looking for $390000.00 and what that money is for is to finish the app and kickstart the foundation so that we can have projects for the users of the app to vote on.</p>
<p>The app cost is a little under $200000.00 and the remainder of the money goes into the foundation.  If I dont reach the goal I set out to reach will either go into the develpment of the app or to charity. </p>
<p> People dont realize that the game started when I started this campaign.  Everything that my app and foundion is about is that its meant to empower you.  Your contribution is going towards building a better world. We need solutions to fix the problems we are faced with globally.  The hole we are digging ourselves is getting deeper and soon we wont be able to dig our way out of the mess we are creating.  What we are doing is digging our own grave. </p>
<p>  I know that most of you have a hard time wanting to face reality.  Trust me Ive been there.  The reality is we as humans have done all the damage casued to this planet. Its obvious we cant rely on any of the systems that are in place.  We all work hard and a large portion of the money we make goes to tax.  What is sad is that the money isnt really benefitting us.  Its being used to fund wars and bailing out failing companies as well as funding insane projects like super prisons and the war on terror and the war on drugs. </p>
<p> I am willing to give up my royalties to go to charity from my tab invention and app to help build a better future for the next generations.  The world doesnt need any more wealthy people...the world needs to get healthy. </p>
<p>  So here is an opportunity to get involved and be proactive with out having to do much of anything.  I am giving up virtually all the money generated from both the tab and app and allowing the users of the app to be in control of the foundation.  YOU control how the money is spent as to what charities, projects and campaigns the money will go to. </p>
<p>There are incentives starting with this campaign.  We have several trips for 2 to come to Victoria BC Canada for 4 days/3nights and be part of the launch of everything, your name put in the app, your name immortalized in the foundation, your name in the documentary that is being done on me, my tab, foundation and app.  If you submit a project and it gets voted in the one that submitted it gets to be one of the project managers and also will have a memorial plaque with your name on it.  I dont want any recognition.  Like i said before I am all about empowering people and I want regular people to be recognized. </p>
<p>  This is the home stretch people and I want to thank the 7 contributors who have made contributions so far. We have a long way to go to reach our goal.  Do you want to sit on the sidelines and watch or do you want to play.  The game has begun...we can make this happen in days with the power of social media.  The reality is i only need 80000 people at 5 dollars a person....5 BUCKS!  For 5 BUCKS you get a chance to win a trip for 2 to victoria, your name immortalized in the app, foundation and documentary.  Not only that...you just became part of the change.  Those 7 people that have made contributions are part of the change....dont you want to be part of the change as well??</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why my project is valuable to you the contributor as well as the world is that I am not driven by wealth.  We are destroying the one thing we all share...earth.  What are we leaving behind for future generations other than a huge mess but how will they fix our mess when we have taken everything from them. Our systems are failing.  Our education system is failing our children, our healthcare system is failing the sick, our governments are failing majority of the world and we are stuck watching our planet being destroyed with are hands tied and our voices being ignored.  If there is something you want to believe in its my invention, my foundation and my app. Like I said I am not in it for the wealth which is why i am donating majority if not all my royalties generated from my invention and app to charity.  Its not about me....its about the planet and the future of this planet.

We have not encountered such kind of problem yet, but we will share informations on our web site if we can find a piano which does not work with mi.1.FAQ
Q. I'm wondering that does it work well with apple new bluetooth over midi feature that announced in WWDC14 ?Yes, We are planing to support Apple BLE MIDI. After Apple release the BLE MIDI specification, we will update mi.1 firmware to adapt it shortly.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

Noodum who?
Noodum are an awesome twosome. Mars (The Developer) and Okayboss (The Designer) met in a digital agency years ago, working on a bunch of interactive projects and campaigns winning a few awards along the way.

Some facts

We used to live a couple minutes away from each other. Now it's a couple hours time difference between Shanghai & Sydney. (We work via emails and weekly Skype sessions)
The name Noodum is taken from our cats. NOOdle the white short hair in Sydney, and DUMdum the ginger tom cat in Shanghai.
Our official food is fried chicken. It's no wonder we need to walk off the calories :)

1 WALK - Take your wokamon everywhere you go. Simply activate the app and go! Every step you take is recorded with our nifty pedometer.2 GROW - As you walk, you'll burn calories. Wokamons feed on your calories. Watch as they change shape as they get bigger.

<p>When I was thinking of proposals for the Google Glass Explorer contest, I wanted to find one that could help people by using the unique features of this new augmented-reality technology. Eventually, I remembered a project that some fellow students did during a robotics class that I took in graduate school. It used eye-tracking technology to remotely control the motors on a vehicle. After confirming that Google planned to embed eye-tracking technology in their new product, I realized that Google Glass could be used to make this idea a viable solution for persons with disabilities, such as quadriplegics.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p>The patent Google issued for eye-tracking technology as part of their Google Glass product (US 8,235,529) indicates there will be rather precise tracking of the right eye’s movement relative to objects presented in the user’s line of sight. With this level of precision, users will be able to seamlessly use subtle eye motions to select controls that change the speed and direction of the chair by staring at a particular button for a determined period of time just long enough for the app to distinguish between a casual glance and a deliberate action. Being able to rely on subtle eye motions for button-like control will also allow the app to track for more extreme eye movements to provide system overrides, such as an emergency stop.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>User-Interface</strong></p>
<p>The User Interface prototype seen above roughly proposes how a user would interact with the controls. The card in the upper right is used to control the speed of the wheelchair. I am working with a User Interface designer to iterate on the layout, and many of the design choices will need to be reconsidered when we're given access to the standard interface elements provided in the Glass GUI Library. The basic functionality in the image of the User Interface are from buttons which allow the user to increase and decrease the speed of the wheelchair, or to stop it altogether. Other screens would allow the user to direct the movement of the chair. All screens will show a battery indicator such as that seen in the bottom left and a status bar like the one on the bottom right showing speed and/or the current selected action. The speed indicator also shows whether the wheelchair is accelerating, decelerating or staying constant. Additionally, I would like the app to provide the user with an overlay of obstacle and path detection. The machine should be able to detect potential obstacles in the path such as potholes or objects in the way and alert the user.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>This Campaign</strong></p>
<p>For this campaign, specifically, I am raising funds to buy the hardware necessary to build the Google Glass app and a small prototype demonstrating that the app can be used to control a wheelchair.  The focus of this proposal is laid out specifically in the Costs section and really only covers the needs for writing a fully-featured eye-control application and proof-of-concept.  Once I have completed this stage, I will be in the position to seek funding for setting up manufacturing of app-enabled wheelchairs and devices for adding necessary functionality to existing wheelchairs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Accolades</strong></p>
<p>Interest in the project is already high. After posting my <a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/0/111975253604295919917/posts/5GpJjg8U683"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Google Glass Explorer contest proposal</a> on Google+, the idea was liked and shared by many people on Google+, Facebook and Twitter. One tweet even got the attention of a reporter for BostInno who later conducted <a href=""http://bostinno.com/2013/03/13/google-glass-app-to-make-wheelchairs-eye-controlled-proposed-by-engineer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview with me</a> for his publication. The article was then picked up by <a href=""http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-03/could-google-glass-allow-people-move-wheelchairs-their-eyes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Popular Science</a> and various aggregator sites, such as HackerNews. The response has been overwhelmingly positive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Costs</strong></p>
<p>The upfront costs to get started on this project are the motivating factor for this IndieGoGo proposal. Members of the Google Glass Explorer program are required to purchase Google Glass for $1500. Additionally, I will need an Android phone ($300) to interface with Glass that I can freely hack without worrying about temporarily breaking my primary phone. This Android phone will also need a data plan to be usable during field testing. The cheapest viable option I've found is $45/mo from Straight Talk. In addition to those setup costs, there are also the costs of the prototyping hardware to allow communication between Glass and the wheelchair motors which will be around $160. That brings the approximate prototyping costs to:</p>
<p><strong>$1500 + $300 + ($45/mo * 12 months) + $160 = $2500</strong></p>
<p>There will of course also be costs incurred from bringing the prototype to market, but at the point that I have a working prototype I will be able to explore a more expansive fundraising campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rewards</strong></p>
<p>For donations of $25 or more, I will include one copy of the wheelchair control UI Android App. This will be received by downloading the App from the Google Play store after I have added your Google Play username to a list of customers who can download the App for free.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>I am a professional Software Engineer and I have a Masters in Mechanical Engineering with a focus in Robotics, so I have experience in solving the types of challenges that will be encountered in developing the hardware and software to allow users to control a wheelchair with Google Glass. In addition to the challenges inherent to developing a new software package, this project will require extensive user testing to ensure a successful product. Using eye-tracking as the primary form of user input is a novel concept so there is limited literature on what standards should be followed to ensure a safe and successful experience. For instance, it will be important to perform field tests with potential users to find the ideal timing threshold for distinguishing between idle eye movement and deliberate action, while not affecting a seamless flow between different controls. Additionally, it will be important to determine which eye motion will be intuitive enough for a user to easily perform it in an emergency, to perform a safe and quick shutdown of the chair, while also being unique enough such that a user wouldn't accidentally send this override signal. To overcome these usability challenges I'm working directly with a user experience designer who can effectively perform these tests with my software.</p>

<p><strong>Biography</strong></p>
<p>After getting my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic University, I focused heavily in Robotics while receiving my Masters of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Tufts University. Finding a passion for the intersection of Mechanical and and Computer Engineering during my studies, I sought a position at IMDEA in Madrid, Spain writing software that modeled the electrical properties of brain neurons undergoing mechanical stress. I then returned to the United States to pursue a career as a Software Engineer at Wayfair while continuing to play with Robotics on the side. I'm extremely excited about benefits wearable computing will have in health care and can't wait to starting working on a project that will provide people with access to mobility they may have not had before.  You can read more at my <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenmchugh"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p></div>","Concept

Track valuables – like your wallet

Has this scenario happened to you more times than you care to admit?You have just left the store and you reach into your pocket or purse and realize that your wallet is missing. As panic sets in, you rush back to the shop hoping for the best. Now, think about if that was your kid you accidentally left behind.BTrace helps prevent crises like this by tracking your invaluables – 24/7. The BTrace early warning system alerts you in real time the minute something or someone is out of comfortable range and directs you to it. How BTrace works?Simply attach the quarter-sized battery-powered BTrace
tags to the things that are important to you and the app immediately knows
where they are. You can tailor the alert range, and if something (or someone)
goes beyond that safe range, BTrace automatically notifies you. At any point,
you can view where the item is right from your smartphone.What’s unique about BTrace?
►  Tracks items to prevent loss or theft ►  Directs you to the
lost or stolen item
► 
Works indoors and
outdoors

<p>Through the Nanoleaf Smarter app, you can easily name bulbs, assign bulbs to rooms, and create scenes. The Nanoleaf light bulbs can be dimmed down to as low as 1% and turned up 100% to a crisp illumination equivalent to a 60W incandescent bulb.</p>
<h4>Let your creativity run wild with the naming of rooms and scenes!</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<b>""Hustle time!""</b> – Turns the lights in the bedroom to 100% to wake you up and get you ready for a fresh new day. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>""Honey, I'm Home""</b> – Turns the lights on to 50% for a warm and relaxing ""welcome home"" ambiance.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>""Snuggle Puddle""</b> – Dims down the lights to a romantic 5%.<br/>

<h3>Future-Proof - Technology that Grows with Time</h3>
<div>Through our selection of software protocols and materials, we have designed the entire product offering to last for decades.</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Freedom to use other light bulbs and apps</b>: We do not want to limit your freedom to select which products to buy or apps to use. We use the Zigbee protocol to communicate between the hub and the lamp, and we have <b>tested with the other light bulbs </b>(such as Philips Hue &amp; GE Link) to ensure they work as well. You can also use any HomeKit compatible iOS app to talk with our hub. </li>
<li>
<b>The software on our hub can receive regular updates</b>: Just like the apps on your smartphone, or the software on your computer, the software on the hub can be updated just by being connected to Internet. Therefore, as protocol changes or we have created <b>new functionality</b>, we will add that to the hub without any additional cost. This includes Android compatibility. In 2016 we will update the software on the hub to support Android control, at no additional cost.</li>
<li>
<b>The LEDs in the lamp will shine vibrantly for decades</b>: For normal usage at home, the LED bulbs can last up to 30 years. We accomplish this through our use of the best LED technology and patented bulb design that ensures longevity.</li>
</ol>

<p>The risks of the Nanoleaf Smarter Kit campaign are small. All production moulds and manufacturing capabilities and certifications are already complete. Both embedded and iOS app software have undergone quality control and beta testing. With confidence, we will be able to build and fullfil the products shortly after the campaign ends.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">It’s easy!

<p>
</p>
<p><b>Does the Smarter Kit work with Android? </b></p>
<p>The Smarter Kit currently works with iOS. We are developing Android compatibility for the Smarter Kit, with an app set to be released in early 2016. </p>
<p><b>Does it come in a Bayonet base? </b></p>
<p>No, the Smarter Kit comes in the E26 and E27 Edison screw base. The E26 base is meant for North America, Central America, Taiwan and Japan. The E27 base is suitable for the rest of the world. </p>
<p><b>Is the Nanoleaf Ivy color changing? </b></p>
<p>This is something we’re developing. The Smart Gem (a smart connected version of our Nanoleaf Gem) will be color temperature adjustable. This means you can adjust the bulb from 6000K (bright daylight quality) to 2700K (warm comfortable glow like an incandescent). The Smart Gem will be released in early 2016.</p>
<p><b>What do you mean by special dimming functionality?</b> </p>
<p>The Smart Ivy has the same special dimming function as the Nanoleaf Bloom. This means you can dim the bulb using any regular on/off light switch in four easy steps:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Flick switch ON to turn on bulb</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Wait for bulb to reach full brightness, takes 3-4 seconds</span></li>

<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Flick switch OFF+ON again to set brightness level*</span></li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>*flicking switch OFF+ON needs to be very quick motion in order to initiate/set dimming</p>

<p><b>What is the power draw from the light switch when the bulb is off and on standby mode? </b></p>
<p>The power draw would be 0.5W and in one year this will cost the user a whopping total of $0.50!</p>
<p><b>Can I place the Hub in one room and control the light bulbs in another room? </b></p>
<p>Definitely! The light bulbs can be controlled from a distance of up to 50 meters. This can vary depending on the setting and objects between the bulb and hub.   </p>
<p><b>How many bulbs can one Hub control?</b> </p>
<p>The Nanoleaf Hub can control up to 32 light bulbs. </p>
<p><b>What are rooms?</b></p>
<p>The Rooms feature allows you to manage your bulbs according to your home layout. You can organize your lights based on which <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">room they’re in. For example, the smart lights that are physically in your bedroom can be assigned to your Bedroom in the app for instant on/off and dimming when you say “turn on my bedroom lights.""</span></p>
<p><b>What are scenes?</b></p>
<p>The Scenes feature lets you create specific dimness/brightness levels based on different times of days or occasions. For example, you can create a custom scene called “Movie Night” where all of the lights in your home turn off except for in the living room where the lights will be set at 50%. </p>
<p><b>Can I use the Nanoleaf Hub with other smart light bulbs?</b></p>
<p>Yes, our Hub is compatible with other Zigbee-enabled light bulbs. This includes smart bulbs like Philips Hue, <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Osram Lightify, GE Link and Cree Connected.</span></p>
<p><b>How do I download the app?</b> </p>
<p>Head over to the AppStore on your iOS device and type in Nanoleaf.</p>
<p><b>Does Smarter Kit work in my country?</b></p>
<p>The Nanoleaf Smarter Kit works anywhere your iPhone works. Just make sure that when you complete your survey at the end of the campaign, you choose the right bulb base depending on your location.</p>

Ever find it too difficult to leave your cozy bed just to turn off your lights? Do you have a light switch at a hard to reach place? Or do you simply wish you can make things happen just with the sound of your voice?

We believe that connected devices are meant to make your life better and easier, that's why we created the Nanoleaf Smarter Kit - smart lighting you can control using Siri.

The Nanoleaf Smarter Kit is the smartest decision you'll ever make about going smart.

















Best Buy Canada would like to help us promote our Nanoleaf Smarter Kit beyond the Indiegogo Campaign! The Smarter Kit will become available at Best Buy stores after the campaign at full retail price. 



The Nanoleaf Smarter Kit includes the following:


One dodecahedron-inspired Nanoleaf Smart Hub (Supports up to 32 bulbs)
Two exquisitely-engineered Nanoleaf Smart Ivy Light Bulbs




This perfect fusion of form and function sets the stage to an exciting future of light.









The voice commands can be given without unlocking the phone, just like how you would normally use Siri. 
Phrases you can say to Siri:




“Turn on the lights” or “Turn off the lights.”


“Dim the lights” or “Set the brightness to 50%.”


“Turn on the upstairs lights.”


“Turn off Chloe’s light.”


“Turn down the kitchen lights”


“Dim the lights in the dining room to 50%.”

“Make the living room lights the brightest.”

“Lights On” or “Lights Off"" 








Through the Nanoleaf Smarter app, you can easily name bulbs, assign bulbs to rooms, and create scenes. The Nanoleaf light bulbs can be dimmed down to as low as 1% and turned up 100% to a crisp illumination equivalent to a 60W incandescent bulb.
Let your creativity run wild with the naming of rooms and scenes!


""Hustle time!"" – Turns the lights in the bedroom to 100% to wake you up and get you ready for a fresh new day. 


""Honey, I'm Home"" – Turns the lights on to 50% for a warm and relaxing ""welcome home"" ambiance.


""Snuggle Puddle"" – Dims down the lights to a romantic 5%.


""Siri, Netflix and Chill"" - set the lights to 1%, just enough to see what's good. 














Designed to reach the far corners of your house


Our products have been tested to 50 meters so it will be able to reach the far corners of your home... unless you live in the Playboy mansion. 













We packed a lot of intelligence into this little dodecahedron. We use the Zigbee Protocol to communicate with our lights. Unlike Bluetooth, you don't need to be in the same room to control your lights and Zigbee is much more energy efficient than Wifi. 
By using a Hub, we can build intelligence and automation into it, creating the foundation of your smarter experience. 






For the moments when you don't want to talk

You can also use the Nanoleaf app to control your lights by scenes, rooms or individual bulbs. 











Future-Proof - Technology that Grows with Time
Through our selection of software protocols and materials, we have designed the entire product offering to last for decades.



Freedom to use other light bulbs and apps: We do not want to limit your freedom to select which products to buy or apps to use. We use the Zigbee protocol to communicate between the hub and the lamp, and we have tested with the other light bulbs (such as Philips Hue & GE Link) to ensure they work as well. You can also use any HomeKit compatible iOS app to talk with our hub. 

The software on our hub can receive regular updates: Just like the apps on your smartphone, or the software on your computer, the software on the hub can be updated just by being connected to Internet. Therefore, as protocol changes or we have created new functionality, we will add that to the hub without any additional cost. This includes Android compatibility. In 2016 we will update the software on the hub to support Android control, at no additional cost.

The LEDs in the lamp will shine vibrantly for decades: For normal usage at home, the LED bulbs can last up to 30 years. We accomplish this through our use of the best LED technology and patented bulb design that ensures longevity.





Bonus Function: Uniquely dimmable without a dimmer switch! 
You can also use your regular light switch to dim your lights. 

With a double click of your light switch (OFF-ON), the light will start to dim and double click again to set the desired brightness. Similar to our previous product, the Nanoleaf Bloom. See below for an instructional video:



Nanoleaf Bloom Instructional Video - Nanoleaf Smart Ivy includes this functionality in addition to the ability to work with Siri. 









Easy 3-Step Installation:

Step 1. Screw in your lights
Step 2. Plug in the hub to your router
Step 3. Download the app on your iPhone or iPad and follow the instructions. 
*Android support coming in early-2016. It will be as a software update to the hub, which we can do remotely as long as the hub is connected to the Internet. No additional cost, no additional hardware needed. Booyah, that's the beauty of connected hardware!

<p>Everyday, we come across battery issues. Although there are numerous solutions around us, none of them seems perfect.</p>
<p><b>Power Bank:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Too HEAVY </li>
<li>Too BIG</li>
<li>NOT PORTABLE for small purse</li>
<li>Always FORGET RECHARGING!</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Standard Charging Cable: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Not durable </li>
<li>HARD to find power outlets!</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, I admit sometimes I feel safer bringing my laptop on the go.</p>

<p>But think about the power sources around us all the time! What if there is a way for our devices to connect with each other and share their battery lives? -- What a great way to save our phones on the verge of dying!</p>

<p><b>A Magic Combination of Standard Cable and OTG Cable</b></p>
<p>You have to carry charging cables either in your work life or your social life. </p>
<p>What if suddenly this charging cable can be turned into an OTG cable!</p>
<p>(OTG is short for On The Go and USB OTG, is a specification that allows USB devices such as mobile phone or tablet to act as a host device, enabling other devices to be connected to get charged and swap stuff.)</p>

<div><b><b>Why we are different from other similar products?</b></b></div>
<div>After we originally launched the project at Nov 11th at Kickstarter, there have been several similar projects coming out in Kickstarter and Indiegogo. We want to reclaim that we are the FIRST creator of this idea on crowdfunding platforms, and the only authorized, MFI certified maker of this concept. <br/><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How important is Apple MFI?</b></p>
</div>
First, you will get this annoying notification all the time for non-MFI cables:</figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451467388/oonh030vwqfx8muzdfaa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>Second, non-MFI cables will be just like how Apple described: ""not work reliably"". </figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;"">It has a very high failure rate. There are tons of articles on Internet about non-MFI and MFI cables. CNET journalist Rick Broida wrote: ""<i>One day, it's working just fine. Plug it in, iPhone charges, unplug it. The next day, or even later that day, I come back, and nothing. Dead. And no amount of wiggling or re-plugging makes any difference. It's like the cable reached its expiration date. There's no sign of fraying or any other physical issue; it just flat-out quits working.</i>"" Please check out full article on CNET: <i><b><a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/why-im-done-buying-cheap-lightning-cables/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Why I'm done buying cheap Lightning cables</a></b></i></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><i><br/></i></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;"">Third, MFI isn't just a certificate. There are thousands of cable manufacturers worldwide. Only the high-end manufacturers can pass through Apple's very strict MFI process. MFI manufacturers ain't allowed to produce any non-MFI cables, otherwise, their certificate will be suspended by Apple. So in other words, MFI certificate stands for high quality, to match the bar of Apple's own product lines, iPhone, iPad etc. </figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;"">We believe that the highest product quality is the greatest foundation of a genius design.

<p>We are collaborating with one of the most prestigious Apple certified cable manufacturers in China. The quality of AnyLink will be super high-end. We have thought about providing more color choices to backers, but for now we'd rather keep it two colors to ensure March delivery.</p>
<p>Although OTG technology is widely adopted, there are still several old models that don't support it. Please make sure your phone or tablet support OTG technology (Google your phone model with ""OTG"") before you back this project. But it only matters the USB-A+MicroUSB end (power source side), for the Lightning+MicroUSB end (power output side), it is compatible with any phone/tablet with standard Lightning or MicroUSB.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your support! We are committed to making the best product for everyone. Hope you will enjoy it!</p>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Is the Lightning plug Apple MFi Certified?</b><br/></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Does it have iPhone to iPhone support?</b><br/></p>
<p>Because iOS devices don't support OTG output, you cannot use iPhone's battery to charge other devices.<br/>But you can charge, transfer/view the photos on your iPhone from Android/USB-C devices. <br/>Furthermore, even when you don't have any Android/USB-C devices, AnyLink can still be used as standard charging cable for your iOS devices. It's MFI certified, tangle-free and durable! </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Is extra software needed to share (pictures were shown in the video) from device to device once they are connected?</b><br/></p>
<p>No extra software needed. To view/import photos, just using the Android system default Camera Importer is enough. But if you want to transfer other files, you could use 3rd party file management software.</p>

</div></div></div>","Everyday, we come across battery issues. Although there are numerous solutions around us, none of them seems perfect.
Power Bank:

Too HEAVY 
Too BIG
NOT PORTABLE for small purse
Always FORGET RECHARGING!

Standard Charging Cable: 

Not durable 
HARD to find power outlets!

OK, I admit sometimes I feel safer bringing my laptop on the go.


But think about the power sources around us all the time! What if there is a way for our devices to connect with each other and share their battery lives? -- What a great way to save our phones on the verge of dying!


Finally, we've got you a perfect solution - AnyLink™, making any device as a power source, is the ONLY CHARGING CABLE YOU EVER NEED!



A Magic Combination of Standard Cable and OTG Cable
You have to carry charging cables either in your work life or your social life. 
What if suddenly this charging cable can be turned into an OTG cable!
(OTG is short for On The Go and USB OTG, is a specification that allows USB devices such as mobile phone or tablet to act as a host device, enabling other devices to be connected to get charged and swap stuff.)


Looks like magic, right? The coolest part is that when your friends think you only have standard charging cable and are worried about finding power outlets, you suddenly turn your phones/tablets into power sources!


AnyLink™ - LINK Almost ANY Devices
With one end of MicroUSB/Lightning switchable adapter, and the other end of revolutionary USB-A design that includes a hidden MicroUSB, AnyLink can link almost any two devices!






Ultimately, AnyLink will become the only charging cable you ever need. With it, nobody needs to be worried about battery issues anymore!
Transfer Files Between Your Phones/Tablets
Even better, AnyLink not only shares battery life, but also links social life! It can transfer files/images between phones/tablets in a lightning speed! You can even instant-view full-size images on another device without transferring!


USB-C support

AnyLink Ultimate supports all USB-C devices, including: USB-C mobile phones like Nexus 5X and 6P, USB-C tablets like Nokia N1 and HP Pro 608, USB-C laptop like the New MacBook and Chromebook Pixel. Since all the USB-C devices support OTG technology, you can literally have AnyLink connect any two USB-C devices to charge and transfer data. 
Please check out our new demos at the ""Demos of Features in Action"" section and take a look at the amazing features of AnyLink Ultimate.

Share Battery Life with People You LoveCharge Your Phone/Smart Watch from Tablet's High-capacity Battery On The GoRemember Friends are Always There for You, And You Can Share Happy Moments with Them in a Lightning SpeedOTG cable has risen to the surface in recent years. It is a incredible product, however becomes useless whenever you don't have a second phone/tablet around. More commonly, we need a standard charing cable to connect our devices to computer or wall charger. So we thought, why not combine the two cables into one multi-functional cable! In this way, people will no long be worried about battery issues since they can always find a power source nearby. That is how the idea of AnyLink came into being.Our mission is to help people lead a real simple and convenient life, being free of nuisances. We believe in the power of great products and aim to achieve the goal by creating them.We have spent hundred of days trying to figure out how to incorporate MicroUSB into standard USB-A connector.  It's challenging since it requires very precise engineering in such a small space with a telescopic joint. With tons of failure and efforts, we've finally made the perfect embedded USB connector that can be transformed into MicroUSB. Our final prototypes have been well tested and work super great! Our manufacturer is ready to go. We need your support to help this product bring more convenience to people's life. Every dollar pledged will go towards manufacturing, quality assurance, packaging and shipping.

Feature comparison

Why we are different from other similar products?
After we originally launched the project at Nov 11th at Kickstarter, there have been several similar projects coming out in Kickstarter and Indiegogo. We want to reclaim that we are the FIRST creator of this idea on crowdfunding platforms, and the only authorized, MFI certified maker of this concept. 
How important is Apple MFI?

First, you will get this annoying notification all the time for non-MFI cables:


Second, non-MFI cables will be just like how Apple described: ""not work reliably"". It has a very high failure rate. There are tons of articles on Internet about non-MFI and MFI cables. CNET journalist Rick Broida wrote: ""One day, it's working just fine. Plug it in, iPhone charges, unplug it. The next day, or even later that day, I come back, and nothing. Dead. And no amount of wiggling or re-plugging makes any difference. It's like the cable reached its expiration date. There's no sign of fraying or any other physical issue; it just flat-out quits working."" Please check out full article on CNET: Why I'm done buying cheap Lightning cablesThird, MFI isn't just a certificate. There are thousands of cable manufacturers worldwide. Only the high-end manufacturers can pass through Apple's very strict MFI process. MFI manufacturers ain't allowed to produce any non-MFI cables, otherwise, their certificate will be suspended by Apple. So in other words, MFI certificate stands for high quality, to match the bar of Apple's own product lines, iPhone, iPad etc. We believe that the highest product quality is the greatest foundation of a genius design. AnyLink will be produced by high-end MFI manufacturer and everything in the package will be in high quality, high durability and great user experience. 









Risks and challengesThe technical issues have already been solved and our prototypes are working great. 
We are collaborating with one of the most prestigious Apple certified cable manufacturers in China. The quality of AnyLink will be super high-end. We have thought about providing more color choices to backers, but for now we'd rather keep it two colors to ensure March delivery.
Although OTG technology is widely adopted, there are still several old models that don't support it. Please make sure your phone or tablet support OTG technology (Google your phone model with ""OTG"") before you back this project. But it only matters the USB-A+MicroUSB end (power source side), for the Lightning+MicroUSB end (power output side), it is compatible with any phone/tablet with standard Lightning or MicroUSB.
Thanks for all your support! We are committed to making the best product for everyone. Hope you will enjoy it!

FAQs

Is the Lightning plug Apple MFi Certified?
Yes.

Does it have iPhone to iPhone support?
Because iOS devices don't support OTG output, you cannot use iPhone's battery to charge other devices.But you can charge, transfer/view the photos on your iPhone from Android/USB-C devices. Furthermore, even when you don't have any Android/USB-C devices, AnyLink can still be used as standard charging cable for your iOS devices. It's MFI certified, tangle-free and durable! 

Is extra software needed to share (pictures were shown in the video) from device to device once they are connected?
No extra software needed. To view/import photos, just using the Android system default Camera Importer is enough. But if you want to transfer other files, you could use 3rd party file management software.",49.0,6,"1 Campaign

<p><b>How does Jiffy

patent pendings. He is a pioneer and among the elite in the fields of 
advanced antenna and phased array technologies. And it is his magnum 
opus that WavCatcher™ is built upon.</p><p>My father emigrated to the 
USA and earned here both his Master’s degree and his Ph.D. in Aeronomy 
(atmospheric physics). During these early years, he developed a 
reputation for solving problems associated with communications systems 
in the Defense and Aerospace sectors. Many of his solutions are still 
used to this day in service of our country.</p><p>Fast forward to now. 
My father's new invention is the ultimate <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MIMO</a> broadband solution and 
covers any frequency of interest in a small form factor. This makes it a
 perfect fit to help cure the ""can you hear me now?"" disease that 
plagues everyone. As end users, we are limited to the confine of our 
carrier's infrastructure. What if we could change that on our end?</p><p>After
 extensive lab testing and field testing across highways and remote 
areas, we successfully demonstrated our working prototypes to 
established retailers. However, they require vetting the FINAL case 
design and packaging before committing to a purchase.</p><p>Our problem 
though is that our resources are tied up in a custom base station 
antenna project for a Tier One carrier. This is the reason we need at 
least $100,000 to complete the final form factor design and packaging necessary to 
satisfy the retailers and go to mass production.</p><p>Releasing 
WavCatcher™ into the market allows you, the end user, to expand your 
personal connectivity. My father believes that a connected world is a 
safer world. All his life, he has gone farther with the purpose of doing
 good. So this is where we are, at the climax of his story. Will you

 cell phone tower with base station antennas is like a light house, and 
you are the wayward boat with a lantern (phone). Each base station 
antenna directs a ray of energy that must enter into your phone's 
coverage area, which by nature is not a sphere and typically poor. So 
the light house's narrow beam must connect with the glow emitted by your
 lantern. If there is no intersection, there is no coverage.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1395576/files/20150418222708-WC_Indiegogo_a8.jpg?1429421228"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p><h1>A Few Myths</h1><p><b>Now let's debunk a few myths about 
connectivity and why, despite a couple sporadic claims, a successful 
real world solution has yet to be engineered for the smartphone.</b></p><p><b>1.</b> 
 If Power + Antenna = Connectivity, then an amplified solution would be 
awesome. Not exactly. Your phone's system has a power regulator to 
safeguard you per FCC requirements. Amplified/boosted solutions, 
especially those near you, must be cleared as safe. And these solutions 
are costly, too big and/or have too much power to be designed safely 
into a smartphone case form factor.</p><p>Regarding the antenna part of 
the equation, the larger the antenna, the farther your reach. Your phone
 is designed to be cool, so the antennas (and there are many) inside are
 small. Even worse, most are confined around electronics and metal, and 
that creates scattering and interference. Hence, the onus of 
connectivity, and the end user experience, falls upon your wireless 
provider.</p><p><b>WavCatcher™ addresses this by giving your phone bigger ears.</b>
 Our case is essentially a super antenna that captures the phone's 
energy and re-radiates it to provide your phone the most optimal 
coverage pattern. The measured data below details this pattern with a 
Peak Gain is 4+dBi. It is of our base antenna element in free space at 
Port 1. The testing was certified by MET Laboratories, Inc.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1395578/files/20150418222909-WC_Indiegogo_a9.jpg?1429421349"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b> 2. </b> An Antenna's frequency band must match what the carrier's

 Hi! I'm Pete Peng, the founder of Farfield, a communications developer 
specializing in advanced antenna and phased array solutions. The picture
 above shows our recent breakthrough, a working field tested iPhone 6 
case prototype that truly improves cellular and WiFi signal reception. 
What we need now is your help to turn our iPhone 5/5s and 6 prototypes 
into market ready form factors as illustrated in the picture below.The PlanOur StoryGo farther. That’s the story of my father,  Dr. Sheng Y. Peng. He is credited as an inventor on over 20 patents and 
patent pendings. He is a pioneer and among the elite in the fields of 
advanced antenna and phased array technologies. And it is his magnum 
opus that WavCatcher™ is built upon.My father emigrated to the 
USA and earned here both his Master’s degree and his Ph.D. in Aeronomy 
(atmospheric physics). During these early years, he developed a 
reputation for solving problems associated with communications systems 
in the Defense and Aerospace sectors. Many of his solutions are still 
used to this day in service of our country.Fast forward to now. 
My father's new invention is the ultimate MIMO broadband solution and 
covers any frequency of interest in a small form factor. This makes it a
 perfect fit to help cure the ""can you hear me now?"" disease that 
plagues everyone. As end users, we are limited to the confine of our 
carrier's infrastructure. What if we could change that on our end?After
 extensive lab testing and field testing across highways and remote 
areas, we successfully demonstrated our working prototypes to 
established retailers. However, they require vetting the FINAL case 
design and packaging before committing to a purchase.Our problem 
though is that our resources are tied up in a custom base station 
antenna project for a Tier One carrier. This is the reason we need at 
least $100,000 to complete the final form factor design and packaging necessary to 
satisfy the retailers and go to mass production.Releasing 
WavCatcher™ into the market allows you, the end user, to expand your 
personal connectivity. My father believes that a connected world is a 
safer world. All his life, he has gone farther with the purpose of doing
 good. So this is where we are, at the climax of his story. Will you 
help us all go farther?The Demo
This is a short clip demonstrating our iPhone 6 case prototype. The signal increase is real and not simulated. The name of the carrier has been blurred, because our Signal case is engineered to work on any cellular and WiFi network that follows established frequency protocols.Everyone's ProblemIf your carrier does not have a tower near you, there's not much you can do to get better reception without enhanced assistance.A
 cell phone tower with base station antennas is like a light house, and 
you are the wayward boat with a lantern (phone). Each base station 
antenna directs a ray of energy that must enter into your phone's 
coverage area, which by nature is not a sphere and typically poor. So 
the light house's narrow beam must connect with the glow emitted by your
 lantern. If there is no intersection, there is no coverage.A Few MythsNow let's debunk a few myths about 
connectivity and why, despite a couple sporadic claims, a successful 
real world solution has yet to be engineered for the smartphone.1. 
 If Power + Antenna = Connectivity, then an amplified solution would be 
awesome. Not exactly. Your phone's system has a power regulator to 
safeguard you per FCC requirements. Amplified/boosted solutions, 
especially those near you, must be cleared as safe. And these solutions 
are costly, too big and/or have too much power to be designed safely 
into a smartphone case form factor.Regarding the antenna part of 
the equation, the larger the antenna, the farther your reach. Your phone
 is designed to be cool, so the antennas (and there are many) inside are
 small. Even worse, most are confined around electronics and metal, and 
that creates scattering and interference. Hence, the onus of 
connectivity, and the end user experience, falls upon your wireless 
provider.WavCatcher™ addresses this by giving your phone bigger ears.
 Our case is essentially a super antenna that captures the phone's 
energy and re-radiates it to provide your phone the most optimal 
coverage pattern. The measured data below details this pattern with a 
Peak Gain is 4+dBi. It is of our base antenna element in free space at 
Port 1. The testing was certified by MET Laboratories, Inc. 2.  An Antenna's frequency band must match what the carrier's
 cell tower is broadcasting. So you just can't stick something on your 
phone and claim to improve signal reception. The antennas in your phone 
are inherently narrowband which means they cover a specific frequency 
pipeline.The problem is that narrowband antennas can be sensitive
 to detuning. Remember Antenna Gate for the iPhone 4? The end user's 
hand shifted the phone's frequency which induced loss of connectivity. 
The bumper add-on was a loading solution to minimize the detuning from 
the frequency shift.Since WavCatcher™ is a broadband and frequency diverse solution, we essentially eliminate detuning issues.
 For instance in the data below, the measured Return Loss is well below 
-15dB for the ultra broadband frequency range of 1.7 GHz to 2.9 GHz, and
 the measured Smith Chart Data is right at the center of the chart. If 
you'd like to understand more about why this matters, please check out Antenna-Theory.com from Dr. Bevelacqua of Google. It's excellent for the layperson.3.   Signal Strength
 does not equal signal reception and quality. Your bars are similar to a
 fuel gauge. It's not a precise measurement. Every phone has a signal 
strength meter which defines a bar by dB. Translation: -70dB to -120dB roughly equate to 5 bars to 1 bar. And that doesn't include what you are connected to. LTE,

<h2><strong>ABOUT BUSK IT</strong></h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Mina Alali. You may know me from my music - I’m a pop singer/songwriter, and music producer. Being an artist, I know the struggle of trying to make money from music, which is why I’m creating a revolutionary app that will digitalize the concept of busking, when a street musician or an artist plays for money. The app is called Busk-It, and it will launch in Fall 2020.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: any artist or musician is able to live-stream to music lovers across the world. It’s just like busking on the street, but now online, accessible anytime and anywhere, whether it’s from home, at a practice session, or even during a public performance.  These are exclusive performances only available on the app.</p>
<p>For music lovers, this is truly live music at your fingertips. You’ll be able to choose your favorite genres of music, and artists performing those genres will show up on your app. If you become a fan of an artist and you like their music, you can support them through donations.  They need your help to be known and thrive.</p>
<p>For every musician who becomes discovered and is able to make a living, there are thousands of equally talented musicians who go unnoticed. By using Busk It, your dollar goes towards these musicians, and their ability to continue doing what they love. You are contributing towards a new and easy way for artists to reach global audiences and generate income. </p>
<p>Busk It is an application, created by an artist and musician, for artists and musicians. </p>
<h2><strong>WHY I NEED YOUR HELP</strong></h2>
<p>I have self-funded the development of the app, but there will be ongoing administrative costs to continue fixing small bugs in the software, as well as making sure we have the appropriate legal and corporate structure to protect artists who are using the app.</p>
<p>If you have the means at this time, your donation, no matter how small, would be immensely appreciated by my team and I. It will go directly towards protecting those who will be using and benefiting from what this app has to offer. If you cannot support financially, a 5-second share would also mean the world! Thank you so much, and I can’t wait to get this app in your hands.</p>

They knot and tangle at the most inconvenient times!Cable tidies exist, yes. But they can take too long to use and are fiddly too, so most people don't bother using them.Introducing Mobu - The world’s most versatile cable clip. Mobu does away with cable tangling with speed and style. Snap together to store, pull apart to use. It's that simple!  Designed to combat Möbius energyDid you know, loose earphones and cables can form up to 120 different knots in your bag or pocket?! What's more, the odds are about 50/50 that a knot will form for many loose earphones each time they're put away. Mobu, the World's most versatile cable clip puts an end to this. It stops cable tangles in style. No need to coil or wrap cablesUse Mobu to snap the loose ends of your cables together before storing. It's as easy as that. Using Mobu is much quicker than winding your cables up and unwinding them. Great if you're in a hurry!

<p>As an EVdriver, I have personally been in a situation where I needed to use a charger plug that was already occupied by another driver. On several occasions, the other car was fully charged, but still using the charger… The current EV driver protocol dictates that it is wholly unacceptable to unplug someone else’s EV to plug in your own (not that electric car drivers are known for bouts of violence, but still), which leaves the problem: How do you communicate with the other driver?</p>
<p>As I sat cursing the other EV driver who was hogging the plug…  I figured it out.</p>
<p>A QR code system, on a small sticker in the window of your EV, can allow for safe, anonymous communications between two EV drivers. Simply scan the QR code on a car, and a URL opens up with that car’s unique seven digit hexcode. If you are also a registered user, you can submit that code and a message will be generated either via email or SMS (user preference) to the owner of that car. The other driver can then respond by similarly following a URL with a simple yes/no form. The result of that choice is then transmitted back to the original questioner. Whether it is a yes or no, you’ll know for sure.</p>
<p>When a user responds in the positive, a post is made to either Facebook or Twitter indicating that they’ve just been a good citizen and, “Shared The Plug”.</p>

<p>Turn your regular HDTV into a smart TV, Computer,

<p>Have you ever wished you could display
your laptop on a bigger screen… or have you ever been frustrated &amp; tired of
killing your eyes trying to browse the internet on a tiny cell phone
screen…well, you’re not alone? </p>
<p>About two years ago, we decided that
enough is enough and we started working on a solution.</p>
<p>I must admit it was not an easy task, but finally, here
it is. We call it the Core and it is the heart of our system. It’s a tiny
device that you can simply plug into any HDMI port in your TV, projector, or
monitor. You are now ready to stream information to your large screen TV in
Full HD and show the same content that is on your PC, or cell phone <u>in real
time</u>. </p>
<p>We support Full HD and sound...And - all of it is done with no
wires.</p>
<p>You can show any
content, on any screen, at any time. It can be personal
content, movies, games, internet or anything else. That’s why we've worked so hard
to get to this point and we will continue to work hard because the future
possibilities are endless. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>                                                              It cost less too!</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/524101/files/20140308171219-size_compare.png?1398137888"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p>

Amazing Wireless Pocket-Sized
Device
Turn your regular HDTV into a smart TV, Computer,
& Media Center without paying the smart TV price!
Have you ever wished you could display
your laptop on a bigger screen… or have you ever been frustrated & tired of
killing your eyes trying to browse the internet on a tiny cell phone
screen…well, you’re not alone? 
About two years ago, we decided that
enough is enough and we started working on a solution.
I must admit it was not an easy task, but finally, here
it is. We call it the Core and it is the heart of our system. It’s a tiny
device that you can simply plug into any HDMI port in your TV, projector, or
monitor. You are now ready to stream information to your large screen TV in
Full HD and show the same content that is on your PC, or cell phone in real
time. 
We support Full HD and sound...And - all of it is done with no
wires.
You can show any
content, on any screen, at any time. It can be personal
content, movies, games, internet or anything else. That’s why we've worked so hard
to get to this point and we will continue to work hard because the future
possibilities are endless.                                                               It cost less too!

So Why Not Get Started – It’s as
easy as using your android phone or tablet…but on your TV!

*Screenshot of COREClick for large image (right click to open in new tab)If you have ever used a smartphone, tablet, or computer, it basically the same! Watch online videos via browsers or applications just like what you do everyday, but on your HDTV....and, it's healthier for your eyes! No more worries about dying batteries in the middle of a movie while watching on a small screen. Just plug it in and your ready to go…
1. 
Plug
your CORE into the HDMI port of your TV or monitor.

the USB cable for power source.

<p><strong>WizardToo's</strong> Vision is to develop and build the first digital publishing platform for Tarot cards featuring an easy-to-use interface that simulates real, printed cards and allow users to do Readings, Explore, Collect and Maintain a Library of digital Tarot cards that will work on any digital device. We are currently finishing the development of a proprietary application (<strong>Tarot eCards(tm)</strong>) and Web Store (<a href=""http://www.tarotecards.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.tarotecards.com</a>), and are preparing to launch the App module for the Apple iOS devices (iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch) next month. We are seeking funding to help us complete the development for the App modules for the Android, Mac and PC computers. </p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The first Tarot cards date back to the 1400's and continue to have worldwide appeal. Millions of Tarot cards are still sold annually to a global market and Google reports over 11 million searches monthly for Tarot. Thousands of Tarot decks with different theming and artwork have been published since the 1400's and new Tarot titles continue to be published today, mostly by large publishers to the millions of Tarot buffs and professional readers around the world.</p>
<p>Tarot decks, similar to books and magazines have traditionally been published as printed cards. Accompanying the card decks are guidebooks called Little White Books that contain background information and card meanings. The Little White Books serve as the basic guide for understanding each Tarot deck but because of their small form factor they are a fussy tool for finding and reading information. For most people, the user experience is far from ideal and this is further complicated by the shrinking number of retail outlets carrying Tarot cards making it increasingly difficult to locate and buy new titles.</p>
<p><strong>Market Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>With advances in digital technology and mobile devices, there are a growing set of digital tools that can be applied to improving the user experience for Tarot cards. The opportunity is to leverage these advances to develop applications and tools that can facilitate the use of Tarot cards on digital devices. Similar to iBooks, digital editions of Tarot cards could be collected and stored in a personal digital library and then accessed anywhere, anytime on any digital device. And because of the global access to the Internet and digital devices, Tarot eCards could make available any of its Tarot decks to virtually any Tarot buff through an Online Web Store, in any region around the world.</p>

<p><strong>The Company: <em>WizardToo</em></strong></p>
<p>Backed by months of research and due diligence, we were able to confirm the potential for this unique market opportunity and a company was formed, WizardToo, with the mission of tackling this challenge. The company was founded by Ron Leong, a marketing executive with experience managing major consumer products, games and eCommerce brands. Minimal initial funding was provided by family members and the company was launched this past January. The core of the company is a small but dedicated group of experienced business and technology people teamed with experts from the Tarot community. Our Tech team has experience building interactive products for companies such as Hasbro, Milton Bradley and Disney, and our Tarot experts have created some of the most popular Tarot decks in the market. We are confident that WizardToo has the skill set to successfully deliver on this vision.</p>
<p><strong>The Campaign: <em>Tarot eCards(tm)</em></strong></p>
<p>Over the past months, we have designed and built an infrastructure coupled with a well conceived business plan for this publishing platform called <strong>Tarot eCards</strong> (<strong>tm</strong>). This proprietary application will facilitate Exploring, Readings and Collections on digital devices and offer digital editions of Tarot cards that can be collected  from an online Web Store and maintained in a format similar to iBooks, enabling the user to access their Library of Tarot cards anywhere, anytime on any device.</p>
<p>We are now completing the first phase of development with the build-out of the App module for the Apple iOS mobile devices (iPad, iPhone and iPod touch) which is now in beta testing. Plus the framework is in place for the App modules for the Android devices, the Mac and PC computers. The design and development of the Web Store (<a href=""http://www.tarotecards.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.tarotecards.com</a>)  is completed and ready to go LIVE. We have successfully transitioned beyond the concept stage and now have a fully functioning application in beta testing. To date, our beta has been testing bug-free and we are preparing to launch the Tarot eCards Apple iOS App and Web Store next month.</p>

<p>Through our proprietary publishing platform, Tarot eCards can publish and distribute digital editions of Tarot cards coupled with an easy-to-use App that provides functionality similar to a printed tarot deck for Readings, Exploring and Collecting digital Tarot cards through an intuitive interface. It is designed for easy retrieval of information and has functions such as a custom spread design tool, an option to use major or reversed cards and a Significator selection tool, plus the Exploring function unlocks information about the creator and deck. The basic App allows Users to purchase and add new decks to their personal library from our Large Selection of Tarot eCards in the Web Store (<a href=""http://www.tarotecards.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.tarotecards.com</a>). All of these functions are accomplished through a single App that will allow secure access to a User's Library anytime, anywhere on any of their digital devices.

WizardToo's Vision is to develop and build the first digital publishing platform for Tarot cards featuring an easy-to-use interface that simulates real, printed cards and allow users to do Readings, Explore, Collect and Maintain a Library of digital Tarot cards that will work on any digital device. We are currently finishing the development of a proprietary application (Tarot eCards(tm)) and Web Store (www.tarotecards.com), and are preparing to launch the App module for the Apple iOS devices (iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch) next month. We are seeking funding to help us complete the development for the App modules for the Android, Mac and PC computers. 
Background
The first Tarot cards date back to the 1400's and continue to have worldwide appeal. Millions of Tarot cards are still sold annually to a global market and Google reports over 11 million searches monthly for Tarot. Thousands of Tarot decks with different theming and artwork have been published since the 1400's and new Tarot titles continue to be published today, mostly by large publishers to the millions of Tarot buffs and professional readers around the world.
Tarot decks, similar to books and magazines have traditionally been published as printed cards. Accompanying the card decks are guidebooks called Little White Books that contain background information and card meanings. The Little White Books serve as the basic guide for understanding each Tarot deck but because of their small form factor they are a fussy tool for finding and reading information. For most people, the user experience is far from ideal and this is further complicated by the shrinking number of retail outlets carrying Tarot cards making it increasingly difficult to locate and buy new titles.
Market Opportunity
With advances in digital technology and mobile devices, there are a growing set of digital tools that can be applied to improving the user experience for Tarot cards. The opportunity is to leverage these advances to develop applications and tools that can facilitate the use of Tarot cards on digital devices. Similar to iBooks, digital editions of Tarot cards could be collected and stored in a personal digital library and then accessed anywhere, anytime on any digital device. And because of the global access to the Internet and digital devices, Tarot eCards could make available any of its Tarot decks to virtually any Tarot buff through an Online Web Store, in any region around the world.

<p>For the magnetic tips, Simplelink uses NdFeB magnet (N52) for better magnetic force &amp; durability, the 18K-gold plated pins for better transfer stability, and finally, an aluminum shield to protect every component from tests of nature. We also designed a small LED indicator to tell the status of your connection, and an anti-fray neck to make sure the cable stay safe from potential fraying or bending after years of using.</p>

<p>We use cotton wire inside the cable along with 4-braids of nylon wires for better pulling resistance, and Kevlar material on the outside to endure all the daily bends and twists, making Simplelink one of the best cable in terms of built quality.</p>

<p>With full preparation and dedication, we set out to building a whole magnetic connection system that helps everyone with worry-free, hassle-less user-experience.</p>
</div></div>","You must have heard about a lot of magnetic charging cable, and possibly used one of them before. They make life much easier when you don't have to plug in and out the cable every time you want charging or transferring.
But they also works only one-way, which means there's still half of the job left.
Plus, what if you want to use it as HDMI cable as well? They are notoriously hard to install between your monitors.

 
Dual-magnetic attachment, charging/data/HDMI all-in-oneIt's always 50% fuss left when you are using current magnetic charging cables with one side in magic and one side in traditional port, especially it's often tricky to plug in---like moniters' back, or charger's ports.   Simplelink has a 20-pin magnetic tip to attach the cable safe and firm onto the devices on both ways, making connections faster and more convenient than ever before. To demonstrate how two way magnetic cable works, here's a short video:

 


Safety pins for safe & stable connection
 
The industry's first-ever black safety pins makes the point-to-point magnetic connection more stable and accurate than any other magnetic cable on market.

HDMI cable is always a pain when you want to plug it in onto the back of your monitor--think about all those times when you search in the dark just to get the wire connected! Want to switch the cable between different monitors/TVs? God bless you didn't put them near the wall.
 
Normal cable VS. Simplelink​
 
With Simplelink, you can now plug in the cable into any display device in just a few seconds on both ways. No searching, no fumbling, one clicking sound and all is done. 
But convenience doesn't sacrifice any function. You can transfer a crisp & bright 4K signal @ 60FPS through the cable to get all your content displayed perfectly on your screens across different sizes.


A second screen for your iPad Pro
 
Why not? You can also connect your tablets or laptops to your screen via the Type-C port to switch to bigger-sized display with zero compromise in pixels!

 
Simplelink also has super high-speed data transfer function. Portable SSD? No problem. You can always enjoy the fastest speed possible with the fastest installment ever.

 
Apart from data transferring, the beauty of Type-C cable also enables quick-charging at up to 60W---where most QC standards(3.0/4.0) is capable of.

 
Steady 60W Charging on MBP in real time
 
Steady iPad Pro charging at 30W
 
You can take it anywhere, start charging your devices in seconds, get the juice at the fastest pace, and leave with no hassle in getting the cable out!


For the magnetic tips, Simplelink uses NdFeB magnet (N52) for better magnetic force & durability, the 18K-gold plated pins for better transfer stability, and finally, an aluminum shield to protect every component from tests of nature. We also designed a small LED indicator to tell the status of your connection, and an anti-fray neck to make sure the cable stay safe from potential fraying or bending after years of using.

We use cotton wire inside the cable along with 4-braids of nylon wires for better pulling resistance, and Kevlar material on the outside to endure all the daily bends and twists, making Simplelink one of the best cable in terms of built quality.
 
Safe, easy and snappy magnetic connection
 
Attention: We have been asked a lot about Thunderbolt 3 cable, now here it is:)

The extension of cable length is a pound-for-pound business, longer cable costs significantly more to produce, but we managed to make Simplelink+ the most affordable duo-way magnetic TB3 cable you would ever find on all platforms, with reasonable price for unlimited performance. 
The dedicated 24-pin design takes one step further to endure super-fast transferring of data and power, while keeping the magnetic tip cool and stable.


We will also attach a free tip remover for every package, so that you get to clip the tip out safe and easy. 


Want to expand your docks but hate the plug-in design that are a pain to remove? Here comes Simplelink magnetic hub! Easy on, easy off, with essential docks and the most compact body possible. 

It works perfectly with our 20-pin magnetic port. Anytime you want to get a presentation, or transfer a huge file, one snug is all you need.
 
World's smallest hub with magnetic attachment
It also works as stable as any hub that connects through physical tip with a ±9° tilt allowance, and the reinforced magnetic dock provides even better stability when connected.
 
Seamless switch from cable to hub

 
The preparation for this product has already begun. We have been working with the factory tirelessly ever since the relief from coronavirus situation in China. With complete design and full materials in the houseware, we got to react to all situations quickly and smoothly.  
What you see is what you can actually get. With all the testings and QC process being finished as we speak, we will start shipping right from the factory as soon as the campaign is over.

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3>Zeekly.com - How It Started<br/>
</h3>
<p>At the beginning of June when the story leaked out that all of our big tech companies where under court orders to give the government all of our internet search data, my wife and I were frustrated. We understand that there are legitimate reasons to collect data on ""bad people"" to keep us safe (and we are supportive of our government in these scenarios), but certainly we felt that normal people who aren't doing anything wrong shouldn't have their privacy violated in this way. What you search for on the internet is private information. We use the web to solve problems, explore our interests, purchase things, &amp; connect with like minded people around the world. You should be able to do these things without somebody else recording a history of your activities. We decided to do something about it, and Zeekly.com was born. (This has been a big news story about government spying, but in case you missed it, the details are here: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files</a>). </p>
<p>Zeekly is a search engine that protects your privacy. First, we do not store the keywords you search, or the sites you visit (commonly called metadata). Secondly, Zeekly is running on 2048-bit SSL encryption, so when your computer/phone/tablet is connected to our site, nobody can see what you're doing on our site because it's encrypted. This keeps your internet provider and/or phone provider from capturing your search data when using our site, also.<br/></p>
<p>Within 3 weeks of launching the site on August 1st, users are now viewing over 1,000,000 web pages per week, and this continues to grow rapidly. Zeekly is a well established company with a bright future, and so far we have had excellent support from the media. Here are a couple of recent stories-</p>

</h3>
<p>We need your donations to pay for upgrades to web servers as we grow, web programmers to help us make the site better, and marketing to get the word out about our site to the world. Here are some of the specific things we will do with your donations-<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>We are launching an internet portal soon as part of Zeekly and need to cover the costs of programming. You will be able to have a Zeekly home page that has internet search, news, weather, information etc.<br/>
</li>
<li>We are launching an online email service where you can have a zeekly.com email address (similar to gmail/hotmail). Your donations will help launch this service. We want to do this also in a secure way, and this will definitely cost more money to explore those possibilities.<br/>
</li>
<li>We have spidering technology that runs on Hypertable (a BigTable data format similar to what Google uses for their web indexes) that launches this week. This is what separates us from others, and puts us in the category with the other more well known search engines. Because Zeekly is building it's own web indexes (in contrast to other ""privacy"" sites out there), it is a true search engine that is being setup to have a big impact on the market.</li>
<li>We want to market Zeekly to everyone. We think everyone deserves high quality private web search. Marketing is expensive. However, we have carefully researched this and found where we will get the best return on investment for marketing.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have already put $20,000 of our own funds into this, and look where we are today after one month. We will use your money wisely and effectively. And, although we put an ""goal"" amount on this campaign on Indiegogo, the more money we raise, the bigger and better Zeekly will be! So, we hope to raise much more than $25,000 so we can compete with the big tech companies in the market (google, bing, etc).<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>America (and the world) needs solid new companies to step forward and provide high quality services while still protecting your privacy. Zeekly is leading the way. By supporting us, you are making a big statement that your privacy is important (and yes, people are watching to see what happens here). Zeekly's very unique story is truly a ""David and Goliath"" story of the little guys going up against the big guys and winning. You can help us make that happen!<br/></p>
<p>Ultimately, Zeekly.com is your search engine, and it's future is in your hands. Zeekly can be the next Google or Yahoo, but only if you support it. We sincerely hope you will donate to our cause and help us bring private &amp; secure web search to the world!<br/></p>

Our story


MOKU is a Japan-based atelier run by Masayuki & Hideyuki (son & pop), a dynamic duo combining the expertise in modern industrial design and traditional woodcrafting.

The idea of Desktop Chair, our first project, came from our own genuine need for something which we feel comfortable putting our laptop on while working on a large screen.

After making two for ourselves, people kept asking us to make the same thing. It was so many that we couldn't keep up with the requests! Making custom-made woodcrafts is something of our speciality, but making them in a batch and delivering to many others is a whole new story...

Please visit our website!

So here is where you come in...

Luckily, with a help of our partner furniture factory, we managed to develop a way to produce in a fairly large quantity while maintaining the quality. But we still need funding for production and for setting up a distribution system in North America.

So we decided to put the Desktop Chair's fate into the hands of people of the global village and start a project at IndieGoGo, a social funding platform that is truly open to and supportive for international projects. Please pledge and make this happen!

<h3><strong>15GB Video files only takes Rapide 11 seconds to transfer!</strong></h3>
<p>This chart is Real World File Transfer Comparison by <a href=""http://www.thessdreview.com/our-reviews/thunderbolt-3/tekq-rapide-tb3-portable-ssd-review-512gb-worlds-fastest-portable-storage/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">thessdreview.com</a>. This is a comparison between Rapide and mainstream portable SSDs. As seen on the chart, each bar with different colors represents the seconds taken to transfer different media files at 15GB data size. </p>
<p><i>15GB Video files only takes Rapide 11 seconds to transfer!</i></p>
<p><i>15GB Music files only takes Rapide 35 seconds to transfer!</i></p>
<p><i>15GB Photo files only takes Rapide 31 seconds to transfer!</i></p>
<p>How would that boost your productivity and save your time at work?</p>
<p>Considering Optane is not even a portable SSD and the mobility OWC RAID0 lacks, Rapide greatly outperforms its counterparts in terms of plug-and-play external data storage combining speed and mobility.</p>

<h3>Rapide delivers 2x-3x much better result on transferring huge amount of media files.</h3>
<p>The three charts above shows how the TEKQ Rapide behaves at real-world writing of different media file format(<strong><i>Higher is better</i></strong>).</p>
<p>For creative workers and business professionals, transferring of large amounts of photos and videos to and from the unit is the most common usage scenario, so <a href=""https://www.anandtech.com/show/12443/tekq-rapide-thunderbolt-3-external-ssd-review/3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Anandtech.com</a> created three test folders with the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photos: 15.6 GB collection of 4320 photos (RAW as well as JPEGs) in 61 sub-folders</li>
<li>Videos: 16.1 GB collection of 244 videos (MP4 as well as MOVs) in 6 sub-folders</li>
<li>BR: 10.7 GB Blu-ray folder structure of the IDT Benchmark Blu-ray</li>
</ul>
<p>The tests were done on PCMark 8 Storage Bench, which recorded disk activity during real-world usage. As seen on the three charts, Rapide has beaten d2 Thunderbolt 2 SSD and Lacie Thunderbolt SSD with ease at 2x-3x faster speed rate.</p>
<p><strong>Also, Rapide will save your time on importing files into or on exporting a multimedia out of editing program such as Adobe Photoshop, After Effect, and Illustrator. </strong></p>

The evolution starts with the Hard Disk Drive (HDD) with USB 3.0 interface that's pricey and delivers only 150MB/s; then there comes high-performance external Solid-State Drives (SSD) that take advantage of the USB 3.0 and USB3.1 interface that allow us to transfer data at 500MB/s. The introduction of Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) SSDs have enabled mass-market storage devices to break the SATA barrier. However, USB3.1 connection interface just could not free up the extremity of PCIe SSDs. Thunderbolt 3, the latest version of the Thunderbolt connection interface—is born to work with PCIe SSDs—to revolutionize the external data storage solutions, which allows us to transfer data at over 2000MB/s.</p><p> </p><h2>That's why TEKQ Rapide was born..</h2><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/voR0dbD9dCM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><p>With Rapide, we at TEKQ are proud to announce that what we have created is going to be the fastest portable SSD available on the market.

15GB Video files only takes Rapide 11 seconds to transfer!
This chart is Real World File Transfer Comparison by thessdreview.com. This is a comparison between Rapide and mainstream portable SSDs. As seen on the chart, each bar with different colors represents the seconds taken to transfer different media files at 15GB data size. 
15GB Video files only takes Rapide 11 seconds to transfer!
15GB Music files only takes Rapide 35 seconds to transfer!
15GB Photo files only takes Rapide 31 seconds to transfer!
How would that boost your productivity and save your time at work?
Considering Optane is not even a portable SSD and the mobility OWC RAID0 lacks, Rapide greatly outperforms its counterparts in terms of plug-and-play external data storage combining speed and mobility.
 



 
Rapide delivers 2x-3x much better result on transferring huge amount of media files.
The three charts above shows how the TEKQ Rapide behaves at real-world writing of different media file format(Higher is better).
For creative workers and business professionals, transferring of large amounts of photos and videos to and from the unit is the most common usage scenario, so Anandtech.com created three test folders with the following characteristics:

Photos: 15.6 GB collection of 4320 photos (RAW as well as JPEGs) in 61 sub-folders
Videos: 16.1 GB collection of 244 videos (MP4 as well as MOVs) in 6 sub-folders
BR: 10.7 GB Blu-ray folder structure of the IDT Benchmark Blu-ray

The tests were done on PCMark 8 Storage Bench, which recorded disk activity during real-world usage. As seen on the three charts, Rapide has beaten d2 Thunderbolt 2 SSD and Lacie Thunderbolt SSD with ease at 2x-3x faster speed rate.
Also, Rapide will save your time on importing files into or on exporting a multimedia out of editing program such as Adobe Photoshop, After Effect, and Illustrator. 



 
Light, Portable, Easy to CarrySince Rapide is Bus-Powered, you are able to plug in Rapide on your Thunderbolt 3 devices  without the need for a power adapter and backup your precious data with ease. Sized only slightly larger than a credit card(3.81in*2.16in/9.7cm*5.5cm) and weighs only 4.7oz(135g/0.29lb), Rapide is fairly pocket-friendly and won't occupy room whether it is used in an office or carried in a travel.When we decide to buy an external SSD, we want to boost our productivity - which means it should satisfy both the speed and mobility - Rapide is the answer.*Note: Photo with THESSDREVIEW Trademark are authorized by, and  its copyright belongs to thessdreview.com Elegant and sleek look.

The evolution starts with the Hard Disk Drive (HDD) with USB 3.0 interface that's pricey and delivers only 150MB/s; then there comes high-performance external Solid-State Drives (SSD) that take advantage of the USB 3.0 and USB3.1 interface that allow us to transfer data at 500MB/s. The introduction of Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) SSDs have enabled mass-market storage devices to break the SATA barrier. However, USB3.1 connection interface just could not free up the extremity of PCIe SSDs. Thunderbolt 3, the latest version of the Thunderbolt connection interface—is born to work with PCIe SSDs—to revolutionize the external data storage solutions, which allows us to transfer data at over 2000MB/s. That's why TEKQ Rapide was born.. With Rapide, we at TEKQ are proud to announce that what we have created is going to be the fastest portable SSD available on the market. That’s fastest without any qualifiers – simply that, the fastest.With Rapide, you can reach speeds as high as 40 GB/s, twice as fast as Thunderbolt 2 and eight times faster than USB 3.1 Gen1. Equipped with the Intel DSL6340 controller, the data transmission control center facilitating communication between the SSD and the computer, Rapide will set speed standards both for reading and writing, making it possible to transfer entire Blu-ray movies in under 30 seconds. Light and portable, this SSD requires no external power, and it is compatible with Mac and Windows devices with Thunderbolt 3. HighlightsWhat is Thunderbolt 3?Thunderbolt 3 is the latest version of the Thunderbolt interface. Thunderbolt 3 lets you transfer data at up to 40Gbps. That's 2x faster than the 20Gbps speed of Thunderbolt 2, and 4x faster than the 10Gbps speed of USB 3.1 Gen2 and the original Thunderbolt interface. Thunderbolt 3 also lets you connect speedy hard drives, various displays (including 4K and 5K resolutions), and other peripherals, like PCIe Gen 3 expansion cages, to your desktop or laptop.With Thunderbolt 3 Transmitting interface, Rapide is able to free up the extremity of PCIe-based SSDs. Thunderbolt 3 Connection + NVMe PCIe 3.0 x 4 Interface =BeastThe most common portable SSDs out there in the market adopt SATA III interface and USB 3.1 connection, e.g., Samsung T5, SanDisk Extreme, Glyph Atom. These SSDs delivers Read/Write Speeds of up to 540 MB/s, which is good for general use. But when it comes to professional use like transferring high volume media file, the speed rate is far from good. Rapide adopts NVMe PCIe 3.0 x 4 interface and Thunderbolt 3 connection. It is designed to transfer up to 5x faster than other regular SSDs and is able to transfer most blue-ray movies within 30 secs. Our new innovation is the much-awaited answer for professionals who have been looking for ultra fast data transfer and high volume storage for long.These three photos are beautifully taken and authorized by thessdreview.com.

If you could not find what you're looking for here, don't hesitate to leave a message on our facebook or contact us through support@megagrand.com.tw. Q: 240GB write speeds of KC1000 (900 MBps) is slower than what is claimed by TEKQ and shown in the benchmarks photo of the first mail. Can you clarify what exactly is the difference between the KC1000 and the internal SSD in the Rapide ? (*NOTE: TEKQ claims Rapide adopts the same level NVMe PCIe SSD as Kingston KC1000, so this question is frequently asked)A: Both of them are NVMe PCIe M.2. SSD. It is connection interface, IC controller, Firmware that makes the difference.Q: Another question I had : the KC1000 claims to use MLC NAND - can you confirm what NAND (type, vendor) is being used in the Rapide ?A: The SSD inside is Toshiba MLC Flash adopting PCIe Gen3x4. We've tried Samsung pm961/981 and Kingston KC1000. Result: Samsung pm961/981 has extreme reading speed up to  Read-3000MB/s but unstable write speed while KC1000 has compatibility issues with Macbook and we cannot solve that through IC controller and Firmware. Q: No. of SSDs?  Which SSDs are in use?  Controller? No. of SSD: TEKQ PSE7 2280 form factor PCIe 3 NVMe SSDIC Controller: The 8-channel Phison PS5007-11 E7 NVMe controller. MLC adopted: Four modules of Toshiba 15nm  128GB MLC NAND flash memory, numbered TH58TFT0DFLBA8H. Q: What capacities will this be available in?A: Right now only 240GB/480GB/960GB available. Q: North Amarican sales?A: 2018 Q3Q: Is this compatible with normal USB as it is not stated anywhere and I definitely cannot get it to work on my 2 PCs?  If it is, can you assist me getting it working? It seems to be be recognized in Device Manager as the Tekq but will not pop through as a recognized logical drive?  I also only get the limited thunderbolt 3 warning each time.A:No, it can only work with devices with ACTUAL Thunderbolt 3 interface. It cannot work with USB, TB1, TB2. It cannot backward compatible even with an adapter, either.This article may help: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27807...Here you can check devices with Thunderbolt 3: https://www.intel.com/buy/us/en/catalog/laptops... Q: The option to buy empty shell and place for another drive to run it in raid?A: Yes we'll provide empty shell solution in the future. Q: Do you make this product for regular hard drive?A: We've tested this with SATA III SSD but It has much lesser speed performance.Only NVme PCIe Gen 3x4 SSD with Thnderbolt 3 interface could hit 2.5GB/s.Also, your computer device must have ACTUAL Thunderbolt 3 port to work with Rapide. Q: Dual thunderbolt ports since Thunderbolt is a daisy chain protocolA: Yes we'll develop that model.",41.0,2,"1 Campaign

I fell in love with horses at the age of 3 and haven't looked back. After begging for a horse of my own for years, I finally got my first horse when I was 11.</p>
<p>By the time I was 13, I was riding in local shows and breaking and training young horses to ride. I rode Western Pleasure, Equitation and Trail classes. I also participated in Gymkhanas, excelling at barrel racing. I went on multiple trail rides each week and those were the happiest times of my life.</p>
<p>Sadly, by the age of 17 I had to give up my horses but I'm determined to have a house of my own where I can have them, and a few other barnyard critters, again.</p>

<p>We teamed up in 2011 to create the first-ever Equine Business Success Telesummit, bringing some of the top marketing and sales strategies to small horse businesses around the world.</p>
<p><strong>The PROJECT - Our Mission</strong></p>
<p>As equestrians ourselves, we have a mission to bring our fellow equine business owners, competitors and students tools and information that allow you to do these 3 things – SPECIFICALLY for your event:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Properly pack your trailer for that show, lesson or clinic</strong>, so that you have the peace of mind that comes with knowing you have EVERYTHING you need.  No more forgotten saddles, boots or breeches…</li>
<li>
<strong>Learn how to get funding via sponsorships</strong> or other means for your riding career, so that you can finally become the rider you KNOW you’re destined to be;</li>
<li>
<strong>Know/remember your between-lesson homework</strong> – especially if you only get to lessons or clinics occasionally.  No more wasted sessions wondering what you were supposed to do, wandering around the ring hoping you’re doing your homework, or listening to your instructor tell you the same old things over and over, session after session, with little appreciable progress.

Hi. We're Smart Equine Media. We are Cheryl Harless and Patricia Reszetylo.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ohm is smart enough to keep you from accidentally draining your battery if you forget to turn your lights off. It will automatically turn itself off when it gets critically low, and then switch itself back on when you go to start your car. No more getting stranded with a dead battery. Ohm also monitors and regulates itself to prolong its lifetime and accurately predict when it will need to be replaced.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439747376/wqurzpakzsozwhnciqmx.jpg"" src="""" style=""height: 179px; width: 268.010928961749px;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ohm's supercapacitors deliver a powerful burst of energy directly to your starter. They work well in low temperatures because they don't rely on a chemical reaction, and they can be cycled hundreds of thousands of times. They're what ensures that your car will start every time you turn the key.</p>

<div> We all know the pain of leaving your lights on and waking up to a dead battery. Ohm’s built-in circuitry monitors the supercapacitor’s potential output; if it’s ever about to reach the point that it’ll no longer be able to start your car, it’ll just turn itself off. Once you turn the key, everything will spring right back to life, no jump start required.</div>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Installing Ohm is easy. It goes in just like your old battery. Simply disconnect the terminals, drop in Ohm, and reconnect. Remember to connect the positive/red lead first to reduce the risk of sparking.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">For our first production run, Ohm will be available in two sizes. The primary size will fit in vehicles capable of accepting group 35 batteries. This size will fit in most cars, including those that use a size other than group 35, but may require some extra fixturing in that case. The secondary size does not conform to a typical group size and can be used to fit in smaller battery wells, but also may need fixturing. You can use this tool to find out if Ohm will work with your car:</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Like all batteries, eventually Ohm will need to be replaced.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Traditional car batteries rely on a chemical reaction. When they're discharged, the reaction turns chemical energy into electricity. When they're charged, the reaction is reversed. In lead-acid batteries, this process eventually results in a buildup of gunk called sulfation which reduces the lifetime of the battery. Chemical reactions also depend on temperature, since a lower temperature means the reaction happens at a slower rate. Ohm uses supercapacitors rather than batteries to provide most of the starting current. Supercapacitors don't use a chemical reaction, but instead store energy in an electrostatic field. This allows supercapacitors to have a longer lifetime, lower weight, and better performance over temperature. Ohm also has a lithium iron phosphate battery (LiFePO4) that it uses to keep the supercapacitors charged. This battery does rely on a chemical reaction, but still has over twice the lifetime of lead-acid batteries.</span></p>

<p><strong>What are Ohms core features?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ohm's core features are its low weight, long lifetime, superior cold weather performance, and its environmentally friendly design. It weighs six pounds, lasts about twice as long as the average lead-acid car battery, works in temperatures as low as -30C, and contains no lead or acid.</p>
<p><strong>How does Ohm work?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ohm uses EDLC supercapacitors to supply a high burst of energy to the car's starter. It also uses a  small array of Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries to keep the supercapacitors charged when the car engine isn't running. These two systems are monitored and controlled by intelligent electronics  that ensure optimal performance over the lifetime of the device.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Will Ohm work with my car?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ohm is available in two sizes. The larger size has dimensions of 9.0""x6.8""x7.5"", and will fit Group 35 batteries. It will also fit some additional group sizes, but may require some extra fixturing. The smaller size has dimensions of 9.0""x4.0""x7.5"" and does not correspond to a particular battery group size, but may instead be used for smaller battery wells and will also likely require fixturing. To determine if your car will work with Ohm, use this <a href=""http://www.getohm.com/sizes.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tool</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How do I install Ohm?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ohm is a drop in replacement for your existing car battery, and it's installed in the same way. Simply remove the positive and negative leads from your old battery, drop in Ohm, and reattach the lead to Ohm (red/positive lead first to prevent sparking). Make sure to tighten the mounting harness to prevent Ohm from moving during normal use. </p>
<p><strong>Can I buy Ohm if I live outside the United States?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We ship to most countries for an additional shipping fee. There may be a delay for Ohm to ship to certain countries. Please consult your national customs office for specific duties and tax rates. Ohm is not responsible for any import taxes, duties, or brokerages fees which may be incurred on your international order shipment </p>
<p><strong>Isn't the 10 amp hours capacity of Ohm really small? Is that enough? </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Based on our experience and talking to people, we found that most people don't ever use the reserve capacity of their battery for more than a few minutes. So one of the trade offs of Ohm is that the reserve capacity is reduced from a normal battery. Since Ohm automatically saves a reserve amount of energy, you don't need to worry about accidentally draining it when using the reserve capacity like you would with your old battery. If you need to run electronics with your engine off for long periods of time, you're probably better off with a deep cycle lead acid battery.</p>
<p><strong>How long can I run my stereo or lights on Ohm without running my engine?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ohm's reserve capacity is 10 Amp hours. The amount of time Ohm can run your auxiliary electronics without running the engine depends on the amount of current your devices consume. The typical car stereo consumes about 2 amps of current at medium volume, which means that you could run it on Ohm with the engine off for hours without worry. Headlights draw about 15A and the battery will allow these to run for about 30 minutes before Ohm disconnects the battery to retain energy for cranking.</p>
<p><strong>What if I my car needs a battery with the terminals reversed?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We'll send you an email after you become a backer and get some more information, including whether or not you need reversed terminals and ship you a version that will work for you.</p>
<p><strong>What are the advantages of supercapacitors?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Supercapacitors are excellent at delivering energy very quickly. This is because, unlike batteries, they do not rely on a chemical reaction but instead store energy in an electrostatic field. This lets supercapacitors weigh less and perform better in colder temperatures than most batteries.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Can Ohm be jumped started if it needs to be?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes, you can jump start Ohm like you would a normal battery.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Can Ohm jump start other cars?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes. When you re jumping another car from yours, you should always have your engine running so that the alternator can assist in providing current, but in a pinch, Ohm should be able to jump a car by itself.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use Ohm in my boat?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We aren't planning to rigorously test or certify Ohm for marine environments yet, so if you try it, it's at your own risk. However, there's no reason why it wouldn't work in principal assuming your engine has an alternator to recharge the battery. Note that Ohm has a 10 amp hour capacity, so if your boat requires a lot of reserve capacity (for running sonar or lights or a sound system all day on the water), you may be better off with a deep cycle marine battery, or perhaps an Ohm in parallel with a deep cycle battery, to prevent the need for jump starting on the water. </p>
<p><strong>Can I use Ohm with my trolling motor?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ohm has a reserve capacity of 10 amp hours, which means it would probably not work well with a trolling motor. Trolling motors don't have an alternator, and would quickly deplete the energy within Ohm.  </p>
<p><strong>Can I use Ohm in my airplane?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We aren't planning to rigorously test or certify Ohm for use in any aircraft, so we do not recommend it. If you do try it, it's at your own risk. </p>
<p><strong>I have a large audio system, will Ohm work with it?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We haven't tested Ohm with every possible combination of amplifier and speaker, but we believe Ohm should work well with aftermarket audio systems. The supercapacitors within Ohm can provide large current spikes needed to drive large amplifier and speaker loads. The reserve capacity is 10 amp hours, so we recommend running your engine while using your sound system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Will you offer a smaller version of Ohm?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ohm is available in two sizes, a larger group 35 compatible version and a smaller custom version. The guts of Ohm don't take up much space, so shifting to a smaller size shouldn't be too difficult, but right now we're focusing on getting the larger version for cars right before offering more sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Will you offer a version of Ohm for motorcycles?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we do not offer a version for motorcycles. See the previous question for details.</p>
<p><strong>Who is Ohm for?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ohm is well suited for performance driving enthusiasts (autocross, track days, wheel to wheel, etc), people who live in cold climates, as well as people who are simply tired of getting stuck with a run down battery. </p>
<p><strong>How long can Ohm sit on a shelf?</strong></p>
<p>Ohm has a shelf life of approximately 12 months.</p>
<p><strong>How long can Ohm sit in my car without use?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ohm can sit in most cars for about 3 months before needing to be recharged. It will remain in its normal state for approximately one month (depending on the idle current drawn by your particular car). At that point, it will go into hibernation to save enough reserve energy to still be able to crank the engine, reducing current draw to be only the battery's self discharge. It will remain in this state until you turn the key to wake Ohm up. After waiting about 30 seconds for the supercapacitors to recharge, you'll be able to turn the key and start your car.</p>
<p><strong>What's the deal with the CCA rating?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It turns out that Cold Cranking Amps (CCA) aren't a very good measure of whether or not a battery will start a car. It's an old metric left over from when cars first started using lead acid batteries.

</div></div>","The world's most intelligent car battery
Ohm is a new kind of car battery that never needs to be jump started, works reliably on the coldest winter days, lasts twice as long as the average lead-acid battery, and weighs just 6 pounds.
 



 

 
    
 




 

Ohm is smart enough to keep you from accidentally draining your battery if you forget to turn your lights off. It will automatically turn itself off when it gets critically low, and then switch itself back on when you go to start your car. No more getting stranded with a dead battery. Ohm also monitors and regulates itself to prolong its lifetime and accurately predict when it will need to be replaced.  

Ohm's supercapacitors deliver a powerful burst of energy directly to your starter. They work well in low temperatures because they don't rely on a chemical reaction, and they can be cycled hundreds of thousands of times. They're what ensures that your car will start every time you turn the key.
 







 We all know the pain of leaving your lights on and waking up to a dead battery. Ohm’s built-in circuitry monitors the supercapacitor’s potential output; if it’s ever about to reach the point that it’ll no longer be able to start your car, it’ll just turn itself off. Once you turn the key, everything will spring right back to life, no jump start required.

 

 

Installing Ohm is easy. It goes in just like your old battery. Simply disconnect the terminals, drop in Ohm, and reconnect. Remember to connect the positive/red lead first to reduce the risk of sparking.



For our first production run, Ohm will be available in two sizes. The primary size will fit in vehicles capable of accepting group 35 batteries. This size will fit in most cars, including those that use a size other than group 35, but may require some extra fixturing in that case. The secondary size does not conform to a typical group size and can be used to fit in smaller battery wells, but also may need fixturing. You can use this tool to find out if Ohm will work with your car:



Once you become a backer, we will send you an email to get more information about your car, including if you need the larger or smaller size and if you need the polarity on the terminals reversed. If your vehicle requires side terminals, select the side terminal perk and we'll include adapters to use Ohm in a side terminal configuration.


Like all batteries, eventually Ohm will need to be replaced. Once it predicts the need for replacement, Ohm will give you notice a couple of days in advance by periodically beeping. This will give you an earlier and more accurate warning about Ohm's remaining lifetime than the dashboard battery light.
 



Traditional car batteries rely on a chemical reaction. When they're discharged, the reaction turns chemical energy into electricity. When they're charged, the reaction is reversed. In lead-acid batteries, this process eventually results in a buildup of gunk called sulfation which reduces the lifetime of the battery. Chemical reactions also depend on temperature, since a lower temperature means the reaction happens at a slower rate. Ohm uses supercapacitors rather than batteries to provide most of the starting current. Supercapacitors don't use a chemical reaction, but instead store energy in an electrostatic field. This allows supercapacitors to have a longer lifetime, lower weight, and better performance over temperature. Ohm also has a lithium iron phosphate battery (LiFePO4) that it uses to keep the supercapacitors charged. This battery does rely on a chemical reaction, but still has over twice the lifetime of lead-acid batteries.

Important Note: The specifications listed here are preliminary. We arrived at them through a combination of testing and calculating based on manufacturer specifications. As we continue to develop and test Ohm, some of these specifications may change. 



 

When we designed Ohm, we set out to not just rethink the functionality of car batteries, but also the design. Our goal was to create an elegant and distinct product that was also manufacturable and easy to scale to different battery sizes for manufacturing.




Current Status

Currently, we have tested Ohm in a variety of vehicles and Ohm has been driven on for thousands of miles. However, there is still a lot to do. Battery management  and safety circuitry has been designed, fabricated, and is in the early stages of testing. Early temperature and lifecycle testing has begun, but is not finished yet. Sensing and control for the auto shutdown and wake up process (eg preventing a dead battery)  is working on the bench for our primary test car, but still needs to be integrated to the rest of the design and tested on more cars. 



Early Prototypes







 


Alex and Hunter are both engineers from Georgia Tech. They have worked together on a variety of robotics and electronics projects. Alex was most recently designing algorithms for high frequency trading and Hunter was leading the electrical engineering on several products at Motorola Solutions.













What are Ohms core features?
Ohm's core features are its low weight, long lifetime, superior cold weather performance, and its environmentally friendly design. It weighs six pounds, lasts about twice as long as the average lead-acid car battery, works in temperatures as low as -30C, and contains no lead or acid.
How does Ohm work?
Ohm uses EDLC supercapacitors to supply a high burst of energy to the car's starter. It also uses a  small array of Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries to keep the supercapacitors charged when the car engine isn't running. These two systems are monitored and controlled by intelligent electronics  that ensure optimal performance over the lifetime of the device.
Will Ohm work with my car?
Ohm is available in two sizes. The larger size has dimensions of 9.0""x6.8""x7.5"", and will fit Group 35 batteries. It will also fit some additional group sizes, but may require some extra fixturing. The smaller size has dimensions of 9.0""x4.0""x7.5"" and does not correspond to a particular battery group size, but may instead be used for smaller battery wells and will also likely require fixturing. To determine if your car will work with Ohm, use this tool.
How do I install Ohm?
Ohm is a drop in replacement for your existing car battery, and it's installed in the same way. Simply remove the positive and negative leads from your old battery, drop in Ohm, and reattach the lead to Ohm (red/positive lead first to prevent sparking). Make sure to tighten the mounting harness to prevent Ohm from moving during normal use. 
Can I buy Ohm if I live outside the United States?
We ship to most countries for an additional shipping fee. There may be a delay for Ohm to ship to certain countries. Please consult your national customs office for specific duties and tax rates. Ohm is not responsible for any import taxes, duties, or brokerages fees which may be incurred on your international order shipment 
Isn't the 10 amp hours capacity of Ohm really small? Is that enough? 
Based on our experience and talking to people, we found that most people don't ever use the reserve capacity of their battery for more than a few minutes. So one of the trade offs of Ohm is that the reserve capacity is reduced from a normal battery. Since Ohm automatically saves a reserve amount of energy, you don't need to worry about accidentally draining it when using the reserve capacity like you would with your old battery. If you need to run electronics with your engine off for long periods of time, you're probably better off with a deep cycle lead acid battery.
How long can I run my stereo or lights on Ohm without running my engine?
Ohm's reserve capacity is 10 Amp hours. The amount of time Ohm can run your auxiliary electronics without running the engine depends on the amount of current your devices consume. The typical car stereo consumes about 2 amps of current at medium volume, which means that you could run it on Ohm with the engine off for hours without worry. Headlights draw about 15A and the battery will allow these to run for about 30 minutes before Ohm disconnects the battery to retain energy for cranking.
What if I my car needs a battery with the terminals reversed?
We'll send you an email after you become a backer and get some more information, including whether or not you need reversed terminals and ship you a version that will work for you.
What are the advantages of supercapacitors?
Supercapacitors are excellent at delivering energy very quickly. This is because, unlike batteries, they do not rely on a chemical reaction but instead store energy in an electrostatic field. This lets supercapacitors weigh less and perform better in colder temperatures than most batteries.
Can Ohm be jumped started if it needs to be?
Yes, you can jump start Ohm like you would a normal battery.
Can Ohm jump start other cars?
Yes. When you re jumping another car from yours, you should always have your engine running so that the alternator can assist in providing current, but in a pinch, Ohm should be able to jump a car by itself.
Can I use Ohm in my boat?
We aren't planning to rigorously test or certify Ohm for marine environments yet, so if you try it, it's at your own risk. However, there's no reason why it wouldn't work in principal assuming your engine has an alternator to recharge the battery. Note that Ohm has a 10 amp hour capacity, so if your boat requires a lot of reserve capacity (for running sonar or lights or a sound system all day on the water), you may be better off with a deep cycle marine battery, or perhaps an Ohm in parallel with a deep cycle battery, to prevent the need for jump starting on the water. 
Can I use Ohm with my trolling motor?
Ohm has a reserve capacity of 10 amp hours, which means it would probably not work well with a trolling motor. Trolling motors don't have an alternator, and would quickly deplete the energy within Ohm.  
Can I use Ohm in my airplane?
We aren't planning to rigorously test or certify Ohm for use in any aircraft, so we do not recommend it. If you do try it, it's at your own risk. 
I have a large audio system, will Ohm work with it?
We haven't tested Ohm with every possible combination of amplifier and speaker, but we believe Ohm should work well with aftermarket audio systems. The supercapacitors within Ohm can provide large current spikes needed to drive large amplifier and speaker loads. The reserve capacity is 10 amp hours, so we recommend running your engine while using your sound system.
Will you offer a smaller version of Ohm?
Ohm is available in two sizes, a larger group 35 compatible version and a smaller custom version. The guts of Ohm don't take up much space, so shifting to a smaller size shouldn't be too difficult, but right now we're focusing on getting the larger version for cars right before offering more sizes.
Will you offer a version of Ohm for motorcycles?
Right now, we do not offer a version for motorcycles. See the previous question for details.
Who is Ohm for?
Ohm is well suited for performance driving enthusiasts (autocross, track days, wheel to wheel, etc), people who live in cold climates, as well as people who are simply tired of getting stuck with a run down battery. 
How long can Ohm sit on a shelf?
Ohm has a shelf life of approximately 12 months.
How long can Ohm sit in my car without use?
Ohm can sit in most cars for about 3 months before needing to be recharged. It will remain in its normal state for approximately one month (depending on the idle current drawn by your particular car). At that point, it will go into hibernation to save enough reserve energy to still be able to crank the engine, reducing current draw to be only the battery's self discharge. It will remain in this state until you turn the key to wake Ohm up. After waiting about 30 seconds for the supercapacitors to recharge, you'll be able to turn the key and start your car.
What's the deal with the CCA rating?
It turns out that Cold Cranking Amps (CCA) aren't a very good measure of whether or not a battery will start a car. It's an old metric left over from when cars first started using lead acid batteries. Instead we use peak cold cranking amps, which is the amount of current that can be delivered by the both the supercapacitors and batteries over a period of a few seconds. 
Does Ohm work with diesel cars?
We're still testing Ohm with diesel cars, so we don't feel comfortable definitively saying it will work with them yet. Once we finish testing, we'll be able to say for sure.
Is Ohm safe?
Yes. The supercapacitors used in Ohm are mostly carbon and a few milliliters of electrolyte. The batteries are LiFePO4, which are  very stable and are used in some electric vehicles. We wouldn't ship anything we're not comfortable with our parents,  brothers, and sisters driving with.
What is your refund and cancellation policy?
You can cancel your order and get a full refund anytime before shipping. Ohm will likely change before its release as we improve performance and consider input from our first users. If Ohm isn't all you thought it would be when you get it, you have 30 days to return it. If you choose to do so, you'll be responsible for shipping fees.
What is your warranty policy?
Ohm's warranty will change as more testing is completed to determine the average lifetime. All customers will be automatically grandfathered in to any longer warranties issued after testing is complete. Initially, Ohm is warranted to be free from defects in materials or workmanship for one year from the date it is shipped. Within this period, Ohm will, at its sole option, repair or replace any components that fail in normal use. Such repairs or replacement will be made at no charge to the customer for parts or labor, provided that the customer shall be responsible for any transportation cost. This warranty does not apply to: (i) cosmetic damage, such as scratches, nicks and dents; (ii) damage caused by accident, abuse, misuse, water, flood, fire, or other acts of nature or external causes; (iii) damage caused by service performed by anyone who is not an authorized service provider of Ohm; (iv) damage to a product that has been modified or altered without the written permission of Ohm; or (vi) damage to a product that has been connected to vehicles or devices not supported by Ohm. In addition, Ohm reserves the right to refuse warranty claims against products or services that are obtained and/or used in contravention of the laws of any country.
When will I get my Ohm?
Ohm is currently planned to ship in early to mid 2016.

<p>Did you know how many disabled people are there in the world? Before starting the campaign, we didn’t know the exact number either. The answer, according to the UN, is 1 billion. It may be shocking to learn that around 15% of the world’s population experience some form of disability. But more unexpectedly to us was to discover that as many as 1/4th of people with disabilities reported that they often don’t have a choice and control over their daily lives.<br/></p>
<p>Here's how Microbot Push can help:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Easy plug &amp; play installation enables unparalleled remote control on every household appliance.</span><br/>

</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Or can be kept there permanently.</span><br/>

<p>When we imagined Microbot Push, we saw a general purpose tool that improves lives of thousands of people as it comes in handy in many common home improvement scenarios.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Moreover, as we went along with the project, we got surprised by how many small niches Push can cover. Many of these niches would be otherwise overlooked by big IoT companies.</p>
<p>As our fan suggests, Push could start an external car heater in Sweden! Deploy Microbots to help your loved one to recover from an unfortunate skiing trip.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 23px !important;"">From the outside, Microbot Push is aesthetically very simple, yet we have spent long hours engineering its internals. To efficiently perform the pushing action to real life use cases, we had to attain enough torque in such a small form factor. To do so we custom built our high-performance micro motor — still there are no existing market alternatives with just enough RPM.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 23px !important;"">Also, we had to create unique seven gear precision mechanism that would efficiently translate all this torque from the motor into a linear force applied to the buttons. We also used PC and ABS type materials to achieve the best wireless connectivity and to reduce Microbot’s weight.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 23px !important;"">Ultimately, we chose high capacity rechargeable batteries. From the point of usability, it is critical for Microbot Push to operate long enough on a single charge. We strive for six months of usage time (approx. 1-minute per day).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446203211/b5upf1pfpohy5do7omfs.png"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;height: auto;""/></p>
<p style=""margin-top:2.5em;"">
<span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;font-weight: bolder;font-weight: 900;""> Design</span></p>
<p>Microbot Push is designed to be as small as possible to fit practically on many legacy devices and walls. Its ascetic form is intentional. Push seamlessly blends with many interiors and at the same time it doesn't distract people from their typical usage patterns.</p>
<p>We created an ambient control experience where household gadgets and apps work in a stealth mode responding naturally to users' lives. That is also why Push has a capacitive button on its top: for convenience and common sense, users can always push manually if the button is within their hand's reach.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 23px !important;"">Connecting stuff to the Internet is valuable. It helps to save time, energy and it unlocks new features. Also it feels futuristic, most of us especially from the want to live in the future, right? But let’s look at average lifespans for home appliances.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446720907/cy4x1jtzlviteio1mgyj.png"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;height: auto;""/>

<p style=""line-height: 23px !important;"">The average refrigerator will last for 13-19 years depending on its type. Washers and dryers should work at least 10+ years while dishwashers tend to wear faster and hold up for about nine years. The list goes on. Despite the fact that product life cycles are getting shorter, <b>it is clearly not sustainable to change equipment frequently (most of the times perfectly well-working equipment)</b>. Don’t get us wrong. We believe in the Internet of things, and we think that most dumb items today will have a silicon chip in the future. But in the interim period the stage belongs to smart add-ons — such as Microbot Push.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 23px !important;"">Not only you can wise up and extend the lifetime of existing devices, but you can also experiment and find out new unique ways of using it. With Prota automation engine, the possibilities to experiment are nearly endless.</p>
<p style=""margin-top:2.5em;"">
<span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;font-weight: bolder;font-weight: 900;""> Future Microbots</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 23px !important;"">Push is just the beginning of the Microbot series. We already have clear plans for the next five Microbots in addition to Push: Microbot Twist, a wireless robotic hand than can twist knobs; IR bridge, an infrared control station; Microbot Sense, a multi-sensor station; Microbot View, a wireless camera; and Microbot Scan, a wireless fingerprint reader.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 23px !important;"">Our team began to develop an operating system for home entertainment and automation all the way back in 2009. The term Internet of Things did not even exist back then! With the support of Seoul City government, we had a cozy office and minimal funds to live in the city. We knew we needed more reserves to make what we imagined possible, so we immediately started looking for qualified investors. However, we failed. Startup ecosystem in Korea back then was almost non-existent. In order to adapt we changed the course of the company for a few years.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 23px !important;"">Naran started consulting big-name companies in Korea related to what we did, personal cloud computing and Internet of Things. Korea Telecom, KT R&amp;D Center and Korea Electric Power Corporation were our major customers. We developed and deployed many of their services, and one of them had about 10M registered users and is still running for well over three years.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 23px !important;"">After we stabilized the business, the whole team decided to stop accepting new contracts in 2012 and did not renew any of our existing ones. One year later we became completely free from big conglomerates, and the team could focus on solely on Prota. Finally doing what all of us believed lead us to meet great partners who later also turned out to be great investors. With their guidance, we were able to stay focused on our vision and arrived here where <b>we ask you to validate our idea and help to bring Microbots to mass production!</b></p>

<p style=""line-height: 23px !important;"">We are making a genuinely unique product from the ground up. Therefore, we are aware that there might be some production delays outside of our control. To dodge the risk as much as possible, we already identified an experienced producer in South Korea way prior to this campaign. This factory understands well what it takes to go from an ambitious concept to getting a real product into the hands of millions of happy customers. In fact, they are the same guys that one of the biggest electronics company relies on to produce their products.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 23px !important;"">The biggest challenge for us left is to be able to finish the software part on time. We comprise of a team of experienced software engineers that previously worked for Microsoft and Google. We believe that we have all things necessary to complete this project timely, however in an unlikely event that threatens the deadline we promise fast and transparent communication with our backers.</p>

<li style=""margin-bottom:1em;font-size: 14px !important;font-weight: bold;"">What is Prota Box?<div style=""font-size: 13px !important;line-height: 18px !important;font-weight: normal;color: #777 !important;"">Prota Box is a hub for Microbots. It is fundamentally a mini personal server computer where apps are being executed. Prota Box can manage and control multiple microbots at the same time, and users can access Prota Box anywhere, anytime through its web-based interface.</div>
</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom:1em;font-size: 14px !important;font-weight: bold;"">How does Microbot Push connect to Prota Box?<div style=""font-size: 13px !important;line-height: 18px !important;font-weight: normal;color: #777 !important;"">Prota Box has both WiFi &amp; Bluetooth. It uses Bluetooth LE to connect to multiple Microbots at once, and it uses WiFi to connect to your home WiFi network and your existing smart devices.</div>
</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom:1em;font-size: 14px !important;font-weight: bold;"">How do I operate my Prota Box?<div style=""font-size: 13px !important;line-height: 18px !important;font-weight: normal;color: #777 !important;"">Prota Box provides its native user interface via web. There's also a mobile app available for iOS and Android.</div>
</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom:1em;font-size: 14px !important;font-weight: bold;"">Why do I need Prota Box to automate my Microbots? Can I automate Push just with using my smartphone?<div style=""font-size: 13px !important;line-height: 18px !important;font-weight: normal;color: #777 !important;"">Imagine this. If you used your smartphone to run all the automation rules, those rules would stop functioning as soon as you would step out of your house. There must be a hub that always stays at your home or office and is connected both to the Internet and your smart devices at the same time.<br/><br/>If Microbots were controlled via some cloud services, it would be insecure and vulnerable as well as more power-hungry (Wi-Fi consumes a lot more power than Bluetooth Low Energy).</div>
</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom:1em;font-size: 14px !important;font-weight: bold;"">How does Prota integrate my existing smart devices?<div style=""font-size: 13px !important;line-height: 18px !important;font-weight: normal;color: #777 !important;"">We use open APIs to build Prota apps that link the functionality from your current smart gadgets to Prota. From there you can combine all these different devices, their features into powerful automation stories.</div>
</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom:1em;font-size: 14px !important;font-weight: bold;"">How does Prota get contextual information from web services (time of the day, weather conditions, etc.)?<div style=""font-size: 13px !important;line-height: 18px !important;font-weight: normal;color: #777 !important;"">We also use open APIs to link Prota popular web services, so you can use them in your automation stories. Such as Gmail, weather service, Volumio, etc.).</div>
</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom:1em;font-size: 14px !important;font-weight: bold;"">Can I get new apps for Prota?<div style=""font-size: 13px !important;line-height: 18px !important;font-weight: normal;color: #777 !important;"">Yes. We are continually publishing news apps on our Prota app repository.</div>
</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom:1em;font-size: 14px !important;font-weight: bold;"">How can I mirror my device's screen to an HDTV using Prota?<div style=""font-size: 13px !important;line-height: 18px !important;font-weight: normal;color: #777 !important;"">Screen mirroring can be roughly explained as HDMI over WiFi. Essentially this Prota app replaces cables that you would normally need to connect your smartphone, tablet or computer to your television set.<br/><br/>To use the mirroring feature you have to connect Prota to your TV using an HDMI cable, but once you did that, you can simply add your TV as a wireless display from your smartphone's, tablet's or computer's settings menu.<br/><br/>iOS, Windows 10 and Android devices use different protocols to connect to wireless displays. However, Prota Box supports both protocols: AirPlay for Apple &amp; Miracast for Android/ Windows 10. This way you can enjoy having a wireless screen for all your devices!</div>
</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom:1em;font-size: 14px !important;font-weight: bold;"">Can I develop on Prota?<div style=""font-size: 13px !important;line-height: 18px !important;font-weight: normal;color: #777 !important;"">Prota SDK early next year.

This way you’ll be able to automate at least one light switch and one other device. Also, you’ll be able to experiment and find new ways by placing microbots on new equipment. Think of this as a beginners smart home Lego kit.<br/><br/>For mansion/ estate/ large office, we recommend buying several Prota Boxes.</div>

Look around. Notice how many buttons surround you? You press them regularly: to turn something on or off, to play or pause, to send or receive, to answer or dismiss. Buttons and switches are the simplest forms of user interfaces. So simple that about every device will have one. We created Microbot Push to connect these buttons and switches to the Internet. We all know, once you connect something to the Internet — magic happens.
Microbot Push is a wireless robotic finger that can push most ordinary buttons just like a human finger does. The idea is simple: Microbot Push attaches on buttons that operate particular features on a device. Since then, you can control these functions remotely using your smartphone or computer.





Wirelessely
Push any button wirelessly from anywhere at anytime.
Or automate when they get pushed using our companion hub - Prota Box.




 Manually
Microbot also has a capacitive touch button, so you can always manually push it if it is within reach.



















Simply add Microbot on a legacy device with an adhesive foam tape that comes included with every unit.And don't worry if you want to reuse it later. You easily remove Push without damaging walls or appliances. Then attach it again on a different device.

Install easily on tumbler light switch.


Install easily on coffee maker's rocker switch.
Microbot Push, just like a human finger, can push various buttons in several spots & ways.

 We made a device for you to experiment with numerous different buttons, switches, & devices!







 Prota Specifications



 Control away from home
When Push connects to its companion hub, Prota Box, you will get the freedom to control multiple Microbots from anywhere. All you will need is an Internet-connected device with a web browser.
Microbots connect to Prota Box via Bluetooth, while Prota Box itself connects to your home network over WiFi.


 Create powerful home automation stories
Push to turns on a coffee maker just before you wake up or switches on the lights on sunset. These are just a few of many home automation stories when Push connects to Prota.



 Integrate with existing smart devices
Thanks to Prota you can merge features from your existing smart devices into a single automation story together with Push.
Let's look at what's possible:





 Use Prota apps
Hue, WeMo, Pebble, Netamo are just a handful of free apps available for Push on Prota Box. Plus we continuously expand our App Library.


 Connect to IFTTT
If you’re an IFTTT user, then you can combine Push with any IFTTT end point via the Maker channel.



 From day 1 automate like a pro!
Not sure where to start your automation story? Just start writing what your devices should do for you and the Prota web app will suggest you available opinions automatically.


 Prota Box is not an ordinary smart hub
Prota Box is a small personal server computer, a smart hub, that accompanies Microbot Push. Prota Box comes in handy if you have multiple Microbots, want to automate how do you use them together with other smart devices, and access your automation stories remotely.

 Prota TV cast app: use TV as a wireless display for all your mobile devices

With this additional Prota Box application you can wirelessly mirror the entire screen of your tablet or smartphone directly to your TV. You can watch Netflix, Hulu and Youtube without the trouble of using wires and adapters.
The app supports both AirPlay mirroring for iOS devices and Miracast for Android & Windows 10 users.
As this piece of software is enabled by one of our partners, please add $10 to your pledge, if you find it useful!
To learn more about Prota Box see FAQs at the bottom of the page.



Most of our devices, especially  appliances, lack the Internet connectivity or remote control interface. Simply adding Microbot Push opens remarkable home automation possibilities to everything you bought before. Bellow are just a handful of many feasible examples of how you can upgrade your appliances using Microbots. These examples also include our estimates how much  will save by upgrading & re-using your equipment instead of buying  new items to join the Internet of Things bandwagon, not to mention the sustainability aspect.Upgrade your light switches

Auto-prepare coffee before you wake up

Turn your kettle into a smart kettle

Control your air conditioner remotely from anywhere

Turn heat up your room automatically as temperature drops




 
Beyond being a fun and versatile home automation gadget for everyone, Microbot Push has a potential to do good for millions of people with special needs.
Did you know how many disabled people are there in the world? Before starting the campaign, we didn’t know the exact number either. The answer, according to the UN, is 1 billion. It may be shocking to learn that around 15% of the world’s population experience some form of disability. But more unexpectedly to us was to discover that as many as 1/4th of people with disabilities reported that they often don’t have a choice and control over their daily lives.
Here's how Microbot Push can help:



Easy plug & play installation enables unparalleled remote control on every household appliance.


Microbots can be placed on devices temporarily and removed when patient's condition improves.


Or can be kept there permanently.

Multi-user & multi-device support allows equipment to be controlled by both the patient and caregivers independently.

We are sincerely moved by all the messages and comments where people applaud our project saying that our product will improve their lives dramatically.




We have just partnered with the National Rehabilitation Center in Korea so that together we can explore and bring even more awesome home automation and remote control experiences especially to people with special needs.


When we imagined Microbot Push, we saw a general purpose tool that improves lives of thousands of people as it comes in handy in many common home improvement scenarios.


Moreover, as we went along with the project, we got surprised by how many small niches Push can cover. Many of these niches would be otherwise overlooked by big IoT companies.
As our fan suggests, Push could start an external car heater in Sweden! Deploy Microbots to help your loved one to recover from an unfortunate skiing trip.



We really need your support to cover tooling and initial manufacturing costs. With what’s left we will start making a brand new Microbot! Let’s make smarter smart homes that work as you want them to work!


At this point, we have already partnered with INTOPS, which is an experienced and high-quality hardware manufacturer in South Korea. In fact, those are the same guys who help one of the biggest electronics makers in South Korea to bring their products into the hands of millions of customers.



Our factory in Korea. Help us to make your Microbots here!



You’ll get your hands on Microbot Push & Prota Box ahead of anyone else.
You’ll explore what it means to live in the connected future by altering your items even before other startups, and established firms will make their versions commercially available.
You’ll be able to join an exclusive Slack channel where we will discuss how one can create mesmerizing smart home experiences.
Also, as we crossed $50,000 in pledges, Indiegogo supporters will be able to choose from two additional colors: candy red and fancy gold. Beautiful red and gold Microbots will be exclusively reserved to backers and won't show up in retail.





Here's a glimpse inside the box if you order Push without Prota Box:


Here's a glimpse inside the box if you order Push in combination with Prota Box:











We take privacy seriously. It is true that despite connected devices are pitched as good for consumers, a few companies exploit them for their benefit by tracking and infinitely accumulating your usage patterns.
It’s a rhetorical question, but do you want more targeted advertising based on your private data from a product that you already paid? For us it doesn’t feel like a fair tradeoff; that’s why we will never track where you attached your Microbots or how frequently do you use them.





 Innovations
From the outside, Microbot Push is aesthetically very simple, yet we have spent long hours engineering its internals. To efficiently perform the pushing action to real life use cases, we had to attain enough torque in such a small form factor. To do so we custom built our high-performance micro motor — still there are no existing market alternatives with just enough RPM.
Also, we had to create unique seven gear precision mechanism that would efficiently translate all this torque from the motor into a linear force applied to the buttons. We also used PC and ABS type materials to achieve the best wireless connectivity and to reduce Microbot’s weight.
Ultimately, we chose high capacity rechargeable batteries. From the point of usability, it is critical for Microbot Push to operate long enough on a single charge. We strive for six months of usage time (approx. 1-minute per day).


 Design
Microbot Push is designed to be as small as possible to fit practically on many legacy devices and walls. Its ascetic form is intentional. Push seamlessly blends with many interiors and at the same time it doesn't distract people from their typical usage patterns.
We created an ambient control experience where household gadgets and apps work in a stealth mode responding naturally to users' lives. That is also why Push has a capacitive button on its top: for convenience and common sense, users can always push manually if the button is within their hand's reach.


 Sustainability
Connecting stuff to the Internet is valuable. It helps to save time, energy and it unlocks new features. Also it feels futuristic, most of us especially from the want to live in the future, right? But let’s look at average lifespans for home appliances.


Ordinary home appliances can last for years. Wise up existing items with Push instead of buying new ones.

 Expected lifespan of home appliances

The average refrigerator will last for 13-19 years depending on its type. Washers and dryers should work at least 10+ years while dishwashers tend to wear faster and hold up for about nine years. The list goes on. Despite the fact that product life cycles are getting shorter, it is clearly not sustainable to change equipment frequently (most of the times perfectly well-working equipment). Don’t get us wrong. We believe in the Internet of things, and we think that most dumb items today will have a silicon chip in the future. But in the interim period the stage belongs to smart add-ons — such as Microbot Push.
Not only you can wise up and extend the lifetime of existing devices, but you can also experiment and find out new unique ways of using it. With Prota automation engine, the possibilities to experiment are nearly endless.

 Future Microbots
Push is just the beginning of the Microbot series. We already have clear plans for the next five Microbots in addition to Push: Microbot Twist, a wireless robotic hand than can twist knobs; IR bridge, an infrared control station; Microbot Sense, a multi-sensor station; Microbot View, a wireless camera; and Microbot Scan, a wireless fingerprint reader.



Our team began to develop an operating system for home entertainment and automation all the way back in 2009. The term Internet of Things did not even exist back then! With the support of Seoul City government, we had a cozy office and minimal funds to live in the city. We knew we needed more reserves to make what we imagined possible, so we immediately started looking for qualified investors. However, we failed. Startup ecosystem in Korea back then was almost non-existent. In order to adapt we changed the course of the company for a few years.
Naran started consulting big-name companies in Korea related to what we did, personal cloud computing and Internet of Things. Korea Telecom, KT R&D Center and Korea Electric Power Corporation were our major customers. We developed and deployed many of their services, and one of them had about 10M registered users and is still running for well over three years.
After we stabilized the business, the whole team decided to stop accepting new contracts in 2012 and did not renew any of our existing ones. One year later we became completely free from big conglomerates, and the team could focus on solely on Prota. Finally doing what all of us believed lead us to meet great partners who later also turned out to be great investors. With their guidance, we were able to stay focused on our vision and arrived here where we ask you to validate our idea and help to bring Microbots to mass production!

We've been through a lot together as a team. All these experiences and technologies we developed are ending up with Prota and Microbots!





Disclaimer: ‘Delivery of perks is subject to best efforts and not guaranteed.’
We are making a genuinely unique product from the ground up. Therefore, we are aware that there might be some production delays outside of our control. To dodge the risk as much as possible, we already identified an experienced producer in South Korea way prior to this campaign. This factory understands well what it takes to go from an ambitious concept to getting a real product into the hands of millions of happy customers. In fact, they are the same guys that one of the biggest electronics company relies on to produce their products.
The biggest challenge for us left is to be able to finish the software part on time. We comprise of a team of experienced software engineers that previously worked for Microsoft and Google. We believe that we have all things necessary to complete this project timely, however in an unlikely event that threatens the deadline we promise fast and transparent communication with our backers.

PROTA BOX
What is Prota Box?Prota Box is a hub for Microbots. It is fundamentally a mini personal server computer where apps are being executed. Prota Box can manage and control multiple microbots at the same time, and users can access Prota Box anywhere, anytime through its web-based interface.

How does Microbot Push connect to Prota Box?Prota Box has both WiFi & Bluetooth. It uses Bluetooth LE to connect to multiple Microbots at once, and it uses WiFi to connect to your home WiFi network and your existing smart devices.

How do I operate my Prota Box?Prota Box provides its native user interface via web. There's also a mobile app available for iOS and Android.

Why do I need Prota Box to automate my Microbots? Can I automate Push just with using my smartphone?Imagine this. If you used your smartphone to run all the automation rules, those rules would stop functioning as soon as you would step out of your house. There must be a hub that always stays at your home or office and is connected both to the Internet and your smart devices at the same time.If Microbots were controlled via some cloud services, it would be insecure and vulnerable as well as more power-hungry (Wi-Fi consumes a lot more power than Bluetooth Low Energy).

How does Prota integrate my existing smart devices?We use open APIs to build Prota apps that link the functionality from your current smart gadgets to Prota. From there you can combine all these different devices, their features into powerful automation stories.

How does Prota get contextual information from web services (time of the day, weather conditions, etc.)?We also use open APIs to link Prota popular web services, so you can use them in your automation stories. Such as Gmail, weather service, Volumio, etc.).

Can I get new apps for Prota?Yes. We are continually publishing news apps on our Prota app repository.

How can I mirror my device's screen to an HDTV using Prota?Screen mirroring can be roughly explained as HDMI over WiFi. Essentially this Prota app replaces cables that you would normally need to connect your smartphone, tablet or computer to your television set.To use the mirroring feature you have to connect Prota to your TV using an HDMI cable, but once you did that, you can simply add your TV as a wireless display from your smartphone's, tablet's or computer's settings menu.iOS, Windows 10 and Android devices use different protocols to connect to wireless displays. However, Prota Box supports both protocols: AirPlay for Apple & Miracast for Android/ Windows 10. This way you can enjoy having a wireless screen for all your devices!

Can I develop on Prota?Prota SDK early next year. If you want to participate in the program, please let us know here!



PURCHASING & SETUP
How many Microbot Push devices do I need at my home?For 1/2/3 bedroom apartments, we would recommend purchasing 1 Prota with 3 or 11 Microbots. This way you’ll be able to automate at least one light switch and one other device. Also, you’ll be able to experiment and find new ways by placing microbots on new equipment. Think of this as a beginners smart home Lego kit.For mansion/ estate/ large office, we recommend buying several Prota Boxes.

What is the maximum number of Microbots that I can connect at once?In theory hundreds, however, we tested 1 Prota with 20 Microbots at once, and it worked perfectly well.

Can I buy one for my office or my second home and still control all from the same smartphone (or computer)?Yes and Yes! You can access Prota using a web browser from any Internet-connected device that has a web browser (smartphones, computers, tablets).

What colors can I choose?For now Microbot Push comes in two colors: white and grey.

Will I need help installing Push? What about Prota.We hope you won’t need any help. Push and Prota Box are designed to be used straight out of the box.



BUYING & SHIPPING
What are the shipping costs?Shipping costs $30. Some extra fees may occur due to customs procedures that depend on your country.

What is the estimated delivery date?We will start shipping Microbots and Prota Box in March 2016. We already have our manufacturing partner lined up and prepared to scale production to meet any demand for Microbot Push and Prota Box.



SOME MORE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS
Can I control Microbots and Prota OS from multiple smartphones?Yes. Because Prota OS, and, therefore, the Push app within Prota OS, can be accessed via a web browser, multiple people in a household or an office simultaneously can be primary users on their devices.

How does Prota OS know when I leave or enter my home?If you have a smartphone with GPS capability once you enter or exit a particular area, your phone can notify Prota OS. You can also make use of IFTTT.

Can I still push my buttons manually or do I always have to use Push?Yes. Every Microbot Push has a capacitive button on its top that triggers the motor to activate manually when someone touches it.

When I push manually, does Prota advertise that event?Yes. Since it is important for your automation Stories to always know the exact status of a button (on or off).

How is Microbot Push powered? What happens if the power goes out?Microbot Push has a rechargeable battery, however if the power in your house or office out, Prota Box won’t be able to perform home automation tasks until the power is back.

What happens if the Internet goes down?If the Internet goes down, you won’t be able to access Prota Box outside of your home network. Home automation tasks that don’t require 3rd party information from the Internet will be working (e.g. pushing buttons on particular time would still work, but tasks based on weather conditions would not).

What voltage does Prota Box support?Prota Box comes with a standard AC power adapter plugs into 100V ~ 200V 50/60Hz power outlet.

Is there an SDK or API for developers?We are working on SDK and very soon 3rd party developers will be able to create new awesome apps for Prota OS.Prota already has the Webhook app that can be used to connect to open web APIs.



PRIVACY & SECURITY
How secure is Prota?Your data is kept locally. It means your personal information does not spill over to the cloud and is never accessible to third party companies.Also, Prota can only be accessed from a device that at least once accessed Prota from inside of your home network.

Is it connect to the cloud?No. Prota is a not a cloud-based operating system.

Will my private data will be available to anyone (including your company)?No. We are not accumulating your usage patterns or how many and what devices connect to Prota.



COMPATIBILITY
Will Microbot Push/ Prota OS work with my iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows, Mac?Yes. Prota OS is accessible via a web app. A native app for accessing Prota will be available for iOS and Android.

Will it work with my other smart devices (August, Philps Hue, etc.)?It depends. If your smart device has an open API, then you can use the Webhook app to use it with Prota OS. Alternatively, if your smart device has its IFTTT channel, you can connect it to Prota with maker.ifttt.com. Follow the instructions here Philips Hue has its Prota OS app and does not need any tinkering to be connected. We will keep adding more products and services that we like as we go.



USABILITY
Can I place Microbot Push on walls or ceiling?Yes. It is very easy to attach Push on flat surfaces like walls and ceiling using an included double sided foam tape. Watch here.

Can I use Microbot Push as a macro button since it has a capacitive touch sensor on its top?Yes, when you pair Microbot Push with Prota Box, you can determine what will happen once you touch the sensor in addition to pressing the button beneath the Microbot (e.g. “when Push sensor is touched, play music”).



OTHER
OK, so exactly on what kind of buttons can I attach Microbot Push?On buttons that have a travel distance of 6 mm or less (most buttons). If it happens to be more, it is always possible to add additional padding on the button, though it is probably less aesthetically pleasing, it will do the job.

I’m still unsure if I can use Push in my case. What can I do?Send us an email or tweet us here with a picture. We’ll answer shortly!",64.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>You like going places and listening to music. You pack
lightly when you travel, because it’s all about the experience and ease. You don't want to carry a
separate music player for two reasons -- first, they are expensive, and second, you already have your phone! So, you
load your music onto your phone, pack your favorite headphones and go!</p>
<p>But, something’s not right. The music sounds caged-in. It
lacks impact, clarity, and emotion. Your music doesn't sound alive. The
sound is not what you're used to because your phone is not an audiophile
device! It was designed with the average consumer in mind, so it includes mid-grade parts
to save costs. </p>
<p>Most people wouldn't hear the sonic difference because they grew up
listening to MP3s, and they don’t know any better. But you hear the difference, and this gets frustrating. Fortunately, there is an answer!</p>
<p>It’s called HiFi-Skÿn and it
comes from CEntrance, a leader in personal audio. For the last 15 years we've built equipment for recording studios, performance stages and broadcast facilities
worldwide. We've designed mixing consoles, recording equipment, and home stereo
systems for music professionals – the most demanding ears out there.</p>
<p>HiFi-Skÿn is the answer to the phone sound blues. We used our years of experience in designing quality audio products and packaged an awesome
playback system inside of a phone case! Now you can carry the phone with you, do

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">So why do I need a HiFi-Skÿn?</span><br/>
</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Problem 1: Your iPhone is no match for your cool headphones</h4>
The smartphone is a great digital music player, but its audio quality sucks! You may have awesome headphones, but your iPhone won’t get the best out of them—the sound will be muddy, lack clarity and punch, to say nothing about feeble bass.<br/>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1145602/files/20150112124812-Supported-headphones.jpg?1421095692"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
If you are into audio quality, these headphones are the real deal. Your iPhone doesn't support these headphones. That's the first problem we decided to solve.<br/>
<p></p>
<br/><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 24px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Problem 2: Audiophiles have to put up with an ugly setup </span><br/></p>
<p>Today's headphone enthusiasts have to carry several devices with them, because no one device does everything right. But given the choice, which option would you prefer—an ugly stack of boxes or a slick handheld? We think it's the slick handheld.</p>
<p></p>
<br/>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1107837/files/20141219173008-before-and-after.jpg?1419039008"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;""/><br/>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Experience the ""Before and after""! From an ugly stack of devices to an elegant phone case that does it all! </p>
<p>Who wants to carry several devices on a trip, on a long flight, or even on the commute to work? They can get lost, your luggage gets heavy, and what if one cable or component goes bad? You would  lose the entire setup!</p>
<p>Leave the component stereo system at home. The days of mixing and matching a portable amplifier to the DAC, to the battery, to the player are gone. We let you use what you already have in your pocket and add what's missing. Your iPhone offers a great, reliable user interface and what we add is a superb-sounding DAC and Amp. </p>
<p>Plus, we are adding an internal battery, which powers the DAC/Amp independently, but can also deliver power to your phone, if needed. We have engineered it all to fit inside the phone case, so you truly carry one device only -- no cables, no bulky pieces, no fuss!</p>
<br/><div><h4>We designed HiFi-Skÿn to solve all of these problems.</h4></div>
<p>We engineered HiFi-Skÿn to take the digital signal out of your phone, process it using the same technology found in our award-winning audiophile products, and amplify it to a powerful, crystal-clear signal that will drive any headphones, with pristine highs and powerful bass. With HiFi-Skÿn, you can have a world-class music player in your pocket, occupying little more space than your iPhone!</p>

<h3>A smart case for your smart phone</h3>

It delivers your music in pristine audio fidelity and on top of that, packs a long-lasting battery to charge your phone while playing!  Besides audiophile sound quality, it features a powerful amp that works with most sophisticated headphones on the market. HiFi-Skÿn is perfect for those extended shifts at work, on long flights, or at home, when you need some quality tunes but the phone's buzzy sound just wouldn't cut it. <br/>No more compromises. Leave your music player at home. Carry one device that's perfect for both music <b>and </b>communication—your phone wrapped in a HiFi-Skÿn.<br/>
<p>No bulk, no extra components, no unsightly rubber bands holding things together! Your phone will slide right into HiFi-Skÿn, and the built-in battery can recharge your phone, or allow you to listen for up to 10 hours! Besides that, HiFi-Skÿn acts as a shock-absorbing case for your valuable phone.</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">What does HiFi-Skÿn do?<br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>HiFi-Skÿn does three things:<p><br/></p>
<p><b>It plays hi-res music: </b>Your iPhone can store high-resolution music, but you won't hear it with the ear buds. To access your phone's true playback potential, you need an external DAC and a headphone amplifier. HiFi-Skÿn  supports asynchronous digital streaming and mastering-level sound up to 24-bit / 192 kHz resolution, dramatically improving sound quality compared to your iPhone's audio jack.</p>
<p><b>It charges your phone:</b> We've built in a powerful, 1-Amp charging circuit that will recharge your phone TWICE AS FAST as a typical USB port. When on the go, HiFi-Skÿn  can use its own battery to power-boost your phone, saving you in a bind.</p>
<p><b>It protects your investment:  </b>We've chosen attractive, impact-resistant poly-carbonate plastic to make a phone case that is both stylish and tough under everyday use. The elegant enclosure protects the battery, audio electronics and controls inside—and keeps your investment safe.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">HiFi-Skÿn features at a glance</span></h3>
<p>Borrowing from our <b>DACmini </b>Desktop DAC and <b>HiFi-M8</b> portable DAC, we used expensive, audiophile-grade components such as D/A converters, amplifiers and power supplies to dramatically raise the bar on sound quality. HiFi-Skÿn makes it possible to listen to hi-res files on your phone. Here are the main features:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1103284/files/20141217112329-HS-features-R1.jpg?1418844209"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 325.040590405904px;height: 318px;background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>
<p>Now your iPhone can play better, longer, while staying safer!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Impressions from CES 2015</h3>
<p>Several audio journalists and early adopters came up to our booth at CES 2015 to experience the product. Everyone loved the sound, portability and features of the HiFi-Skÿn. There was a lot of excitement in the air. People cannot wait to get this product!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1145764/files/20150112134635-early-customers.jpg?1421099195"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>

<p>You may have invested in awesome headphones, but when you plug them into the phone, something's missing from your music. It just doesn't sound the same as it does on your home system or your desktop system... It just isn't ALIVE. If this is painfully familiar, then HiFi-Skÿn is for you. It'll breathe LIFE into your music.</p>
<p>A quick checklist:</p>
<ul><li>Not ready to give up your iPhone 5 yet? Add hi-res sound and an extra battery, and get awesome audio playback quality that is future-proof with DSD support!</li></ul>
<ul><li>Planning to upgrade to iPhone 6? Your old iPhone 5 can now become a music player with extended battery life!</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Have an iPod Touch 5G with lots of music on it? HiFi-Skÿn will fit it perfectly, and is a great way to get a hi-res music player with a familiar interface, for less.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The HiFi-Skyn story</h3>
<div>
<p>HiFi-Skÿn has been in development for well over a year. The design goal was always simple -- improve sound quality of the most popular phones in the world. But making the product so small was a challenge: components reserved for audiophiles are typically larger than consumer-grade parts. But nevertheless, we kept trying. </p>
<p>First, we released <b>HiFi-M8</b>, a portable iPhone DAC/amp, which was extremely popular, but just a bit big. Then we released <b>Mini-M8</b>, which was 30% thinner, but STILL a little big for everyday use. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1169604/files/20150123110200-three-products-1.jpg?1422039720"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We kept pushing the boundaries and eventually packed all circuitry into something as tiny as a phone case. We are finally happy with what we've got and cannot wait to bring this product to you!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1109586/files/20141220235502-Capture-1-bright.jpg?1419148502"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Miniaturizing HiFi-Skÿn required modern SMT technology and precision assembly equipment. Today we already have a network of reliable production suppliers. When planning this project,  we worked to minimize any cost, logistics and quality risks. This reduces the ""gotchas"" and speeds up the delivery to you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1103323/files/20141217114236-at-SMT-1200.jpg?1418845356"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As of today, we have fully functional samples and design is ready for production. The technology used in HiFi-Skÿn is already proven -- it comes from our award-winning <b>HiFi-M8, Mini-M8</b> and other products.</p>
<p><i>We showed HiFi-Skÿn prototypes at the Rocky Mountain Audio Fest in Denver in October 2014, </i><i>and the hardcore headphone enthusiasts at CanJam loved it!  We made more tweaks and will be showing the updated product at CES, January 2015.</i></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What will I get?</h3>Until now, high-end sound carried a high price tag. We know—our own award-winning HiFi-M8 and Mini-M8 cost $700 each. That's because we make them in smaller quantities to satisfy the needs of audiophiles. This product is different. We are going to reduce the cost due to larger production volumes and pass the savings on to you.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>HiFi-Skÿn's retail price will be $399. But Indiegogo contributors such as yourself will have access to a limited number of attractive perks. These deals won't last, so act now to take advantage of exceptional savings! But it gets even better—you can make money by simply sharing this campaign with your friends  across all of your social media channels (facebook, twitter, instagram, reddit, head-fi, etc.)</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In many Scandinavian languages, the word <b>""Skyn""</b> means <b>""sensation""</b>. As audiophiles ourselves, we know what it feels like when the music fidelity is so good, it seems like the band is playing right in front of you in the room. That true sensation of ""being there"" is what this product is designed to deliver. Users of our products are amazed with the audio quality that lets them rediscover their entire music collections. We want you to have the same experience, on the go. Try it and you will be a believer. You won't go back to iPhone's headphone jack ever again!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Let's work together!</h3>
<p>We are obsessed with sound quality, but we don't develop products in isolation -- we prefer to include the user in the process. This is your chance to shape what's next. HiFi-Skÿn is our fourth crowd-sourcing effort. Previous projects, co-developed with the community went extremely well. We listen to your feedback, stay in a dialog, and implement your requests when selecting features and design.</p>
<p>By pledging your support, you can help us increase the amount of product we can order from the factory, as well as accelerate the speed, with which we can get it into your hands. This in turn lowers production costs and helps us make the product more affordable. Your support will be a vital spark in growing a company obsessed with creating the best sounding, most liberating audio devices in the world.</p>
<p>Please support us today and help us fight bad sound on this planet!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is not our first product. We already have many products on the market, so the risks are minimized due to our experience.</p>
<p>We have a goal of shipping units in March 2015. Your support will help us speed up mass-production, acquire parts and tooling, and hire additional manpower to get units shipping asap.  If we don't meet the funding goal, we will still continue with the project and will bring this revolutionary product to market. We believe in this product concept and will make it happen. We've done this on our own with DACport, DACmini, HiFi-M8, and  other products, but here we are looking to speed things up via crowd-funding. So speed the main risk, which you can help mitigate by contributing today. Help us deliver the product as fast as possible!</p>

With CEntrance, you can rely on audio quality, build quality and value. We've been profiled in numerous media publications. Here is a small sampling.</div>","Turn your phone into an awesome music player!
What's wrong with my phone?
You like going places and listening to music. You pack
lightly when you travel, because it’s all about the experience and ease. You don't want to carry a
separate music player for two reasons -- first, they are expensive, and second, you already have your phone! So, you
load your music onto your phone, pack your favorite headphones and go!
But, something’s not right. The music sounds caged-in. It
lacks impact, clarity, and emotion. Your music doesn't sound alive. The
sound is not what you're used to because your phone is not an audiophile
device! It was designed with the average consumer in mind, so it includes mid-grade parts
to save costs. 
Most people wouldn't hear the sonic difference because they grew up
listening to MP3s, and they don’t know any better. But you hear the difference, and this gets frustrating. Fortunately, there is an answer!
It’s called HiFi-Skÿn and it
comes from CEntrance, a leader in personal audio. For the last 15 years we've built equipment for recording studios, performance stages and broadcast facilities
worldwide. We've designed mixing consoles, recording equipment, and home stereo
systems for music professionals – the most demanding ears out there.
HiFi-Skÿn is the answer to the phone sound blues. We used our years of experience in designing quality audio products and packaged an awesome
playback system inside of a phone case! Now you can carry the phone with you, do
your work AND listen to music in a whole new way. Leave the expensive music player behind. You no longer
need it. Your iPhone is now a work-and-play device with great sound quality
and a longer battery life.

Thank you for helping us reach the stretch goals!You voted for these additions and we are working hard to make them happen. Thank you for helping us meet these goals and add to what's already shaping up to be and incredible product! Share this campaign with friends and family!We reached the first four goals and made tons of improvements. We redesigned HiFi-Skÿn's headphone amplifier. We redesigned the power supply and gave you an easier charging method -- use any USB charger (however iPad charger is preferred due to higher power.) We've worked hard to deliver even better sound quality via an upgraded D/A converter. We are giving you three colors to choose from! Next, we have a custom high-resolution playback app! Help us make these goals a success! Donate to the campaign now!Update: Editor's Choice Award!

Look what just happened! The Absolute Sound Magazine has given our HiFi-M8 the coveted editor's choice award for 2015! As some of you may know, HiFi-Skyn is largely based on HiFi-M8 design, which means that you will not be disappointed. We are planning to make HiFi-Skÿn sound even better than HiFi-M8! 





Update: Amp Extreme
Earlier on in the product design cycle, we felt that 130 mW of output power would be sufficient to drive the majority of headphones, so we designed that into the product. But during the campaign we got a lot of useful customer feedback, and one of the more persistent requests was for hotter output. So, we upgraded the Classic Amp to Super Amp, to deliver 210 mW of power. Yet, somehow that still didn't feel like a breakthrough, so we pushed further and also upgraded the power supply to deliver a total of over 300 mW! This covers pretty much all headphones on the market, making HiFi-Skyn an extremely versatile DAC/Amp that gives you extra dynamic range, lowers the distortion and helps control the noise floor, so that music is the only thing reaching your ears.  This new amp plus power supply combo is called ""Amp Extreme"". It will be standard on all units that will retail at $499




So why do I need a HiFi-Skÿn?



Problem 1: Your iPhone is no match for your cool headphones
The smartphone is a great digital music player, but its audio quality sucks! You may have awesome headphones, but your iPhone won’t get the best out of them—the sound will be muddy, lack clarity and punch, to say nothing about feeble bass.



If you are into audio quality, these headphones are the real deal. Your iPhone doesn't support these headphones. That's the first problem we decided to solve.

Problem 2: Audiophiles have to put up with an ugly setup 
Today's headphone enthusiasts have to carry several devices with them, because no one device does everything right. But given the choice, which option would you prefer—an ugly stack of boxes or a slick handheld? We think it's the slick handheld.





Experience the ""Before and after""! From an ugly stack of devices to an elegant phone case that does it all! 
Who wants to carry several devices on a trip, on a long flight, or even on the commute to work? They can get lost, your luggage gets heavy, and what if one cable or component goes bad? You would  lose the entire setup!
Leave the component stereo system at home. The days of mixing and matching a portable amplifier to the DAC, to the battery, to the player are gone. We let you use what you already have in your pocket and add what's missing. Your iPhone offers a great, reliable user interface and what we add is a superb-sounding DAC and Amp. 
Plus, we are adding an internal battery, which powers the DAC/Amp independently, but can also deliver power to your phone, if needed. We have engineered it all to fit inside the phone case, so you truly carry one device only -- no cables, no bulky pieces, no fuss!
We designed HiFi-Skÿn to solve all of these problems.
We engineered HiFi-Skÿn to take the digital signal out of your phone, process it using the same technology found in our award-winning audiophile products, and amplify it to a powerful, crystal-clear signal that will drive any headphones, with pristine highs and powerful bass. With HiFi-Skÿn, you can have a world-class music player in your pocket, occupying little more space than your iPhone!


A smart case for your smart phone
The CEntrance HiFi-Skÿn is a sound card inside the phone case. It delivers your music in pristine audio fidelity and on top of that, packs a long-lasting battery to charge your phone while playing!  Besides audiophile sound quality, it features a powerful amp that works with most sophisticated headphones on the market. HiFi-Skÿn is perfect for those extended shifts at work, on long flights, or at home, when you need some quality tunes but the phone's buzzy sound just wouldn't cut it. No more compromises. Leave your music player at home. Carry one device that's perfect for both music and communication—your phone wrapped in a HiFi-Skÿn.
No bulk, no extra components, no unsightly rubber bands holding things together! Your phone will slide right into HiFi-Skÿn, and the built-in battery can recharge your phone, or allow you to listen for up to 10 hours! Besides that, HiFi-Skÿn acts as a shock-absorbing case for your valuable phone.
Turn your iPhone into an audiophile music player—TODAY! 






Who we are
CEntrance owes its reputation to thousands of users and owners of our products, all around the world. Starting out as designers behind today's famous audio brands, CEntrance now  has many of its own products on the market. Our products are endorsed by Hollywood's famous producers, mastering engineers and musicians: people who demand quality— just like you do!—and whose livelihoods depend upon our products. 

Our list of endorsers includes Harry Shearer from This is Spinal Tap, John Kapelos from Law and Order, David Bryson from Counting Crows, Richard Fortus, who plays with Guns and Roses, Rihanna, and Britney Spears; David Hampton, recording engineer for Prince and many others!

CEntrance recording products are used by the following famous broadcasters: 




With CEntrance, you can rely on audio quality, build quality and value. 

CEntrance in the Media
We've been profiled in numerous media publications. Here is a small sampling.



Our motto is ""Making Audio Personal™"" and we believe that you don't need to pay thousands of dollars for a great sounding system.  Over the years we have perfected portable audio technology and learned how to shrink an audiophile system down in size. All these years spent refining portable audio gear resulted in the HiFi-Skÿn—the ultimate Audiophile System for your iPhone!

Proof of our quality
We're CEntrance:  A world leader in digital audio. You’ll see our professional products in recording and broadcast studios all over the world. Our personal audio products are killer, too: CNET called our HiFi-M8 “The best-sounding headphone amp ever tested.” 

Our DACmini was featured on the cover of Stereophile magazine!
Just look at the industry awards given to CEntrance over the years:
Industry Awards for CEntrance

Given our background, you wouldn't expect us to settle for mediocre sound quality—and we didn’t! We used our expertise with audiophile products to transform the audio system of your phone and dramatically improve you music enjoyment.




What does HiFi-Skÿn do?


HiFi-Skÿn does three things:
It plays hi-res music: Your iPhone can store high-resolution music, but you won't hear it with the ear buds. To access your phone's true playback potential, you need an external DAC and a headphone amplifier. HiFi-Skÿn  supports asynchronous digital streaming and mastering-level sound up to 24-bit / 192 kHz resolution, dramatically improving sound quality compared to your iPhone's audio jack.
It charges your phone: We've built in a powerful, 1-Amp charging circuit that will recharge your phone TWICE AS FAST as a typical USB port. When on the go, HiFi-Skÿn  can use its own battery to power-boost your phone, saving you in a bind.
It protects your investment:  We've chosen attractive, impact-resistant poly-carbonate plastic to make a phone case that is both stylish and tough under everyday use. The elegant enclosure protects the battery, audio electronics and controls inside—and keeps your investment safe.







HiFi-Skÿn features at a glance
Borrowing from our DACmini Desktop DAC and HiFi-M8 portable DAC, we used expensive, audiophile-grade components such as D/A converters, amplifiers and power supplies to dramatically raise the bar on sound quality. HiFi-Skÿn makes it possible to listen to hi-res files on your phone. Here are the main features:

Now your iPhone can play better, longer, while staying safer!

Impressions from CES 2015
Several audio journalists and early adopters came up to our booth at CES 2015 to experience the product. Everyone loved the sound, portability and features of the HiFi-Skÿn. There was a lot of excitement in the air. People cannot wait to get this product!


Who is HiFi-Skÿn for?
You may have invested in awesome headphones, but when you plug them into the phone, something's missing from your music. It just doesn't sound the same as it does on your home system or your desktop system... It just isn't ALIVE. If this is painfully familiar, then HiFi-Skÿn is for you. It'll breathe LIFE into your music.
A quick checklist:
Not ready to give up your iPhone 5 yet? Add hi-res sound and an extra battery, and get awesome audio playback quality that is future-proof with DSD support!
Planning to upgrade to iPhone 6? Your old iPhone 5 can now become a music player with extended battery life!

Have an iPod Touch 5G with lots of music on it? HiFi-Skÿn will fit it perfectly, and is a great way to get a hi-res music player with a familiar interface, for less.



The HiFi-Skyn story

HiFi-Skÿn has been in development for well over a year. The design goal was always simple -- improve sound quality of the most popular phones in the world. But making the product so small was a challenge: components reserved for audiophiles are typically larger than consumer-grade parts. But nevertheless, we kept trying. 
First, we released HiFi-M8, a portable iPhone DAC/amp, which was extremely popular, but just a bit big. Then we released Mini-M8, which was 30% thinner, but STILL a little big for everyday use. 




We kept pushing the boundaries and eventually packed all circuitry into something as tiny as a phone case. We are finally happy with what we've got and cannot wait to bring this product to you!



Miniaturizing HiFi-Skÿn required modern SMT technology and precision assembly equipment. Today we already have a network of reliable production suppliers. When planning this project,  we worked to minimize any cost, logistics and quality risks. This reduces the ""gotchas"" and speeds up the delivery to you.



As of today, we have fully functional samples and design is ready for production. The technology used in HiFi-Skÿn is already proven -- it comes from our award-winning HiFi-M8, Mini-M8 and other products.
We showed HiFi-Skÿn prototypes at the Rocky Mountain Audio Fest in Denver in October 2014, and the hardcore headphone enthusiasts at CanJam loved it!  We made more tweaks and will be showing the updated product at CES, January 2015.




What will I get?Until now, high-end sound carried a high price tag. We know—our own award-winning HiFi-M8 and Mini-M8 cost $700 each. That's because we make them in smaller quantities to satisfy the needs of audiophiles. This product is different. We are going to reduce the cost due to larger production volumes and pass the savings on to you.

HiFi-Skÿn's retail price will be $399. But Indiegogo contributors such as yourself will have access to a limited number of attractive perks. These deals won't last, so act now to take advantage of exceptional savings! But it gets even better—you can make money by simply sharing this campaign with your friends  across all of your social media channels (facebook, twitter, instagram, reddit, head-fi, etc.)

Why did we pick that name?



In many Scandinavian languages, the word ""Skyn"" means ""sensation"". As audiophiles ourselves, we know what it feels like when the music fidelity is so good, it seems like the band is playing right in front of you in the room. That true sensation of ""being there"" is what this product is designed to deliver. Users of our products are amazed with the audio quality that lets them rediscover their entire music collections. We want you to have the same experience, on the go. Try it and you will be a believer. You won't go back to iPhone's headphone jack ever again!

Let's work together!
We are obsessed with sound quality, but we don't develop products in isolation -- we prefer to include the user in the process. This is your chance to shape what's next. HiFi-Skÿn is our fourth crowd-sourcing effort. Previous projects, co-developed with the community went extremely well. We listen to your feedback, stay in a dialog, and implement your requests when selecting features and design.
By pledging your support, you can help us increase the amount of product we can order from the factory, as well as accelerate the speed, with which we can get it into your hands. This in turn lowers production costs and helps us make the product more affordable. Your support will be a vital spark in growing a company obsessed with creating the best sounding, most liberating audio devices in the world.
Please support us today and help us fight bad sound on this planet!

Risks & Challenges
This is not our first product. We already have many products on the market, so the risks are minimized due to our experience.
We have a goal of shipping units in March 2015. Your support will help us speed up mass-production, acquire parts and tooling, and hire additional manpower to get units shipping asap.  If we don't meet the funding goal, we will still continue with the project and will bring this revolutionary product to market. We believe in this product concept and will make it happen. We've done this on our own with DACport, DACmini, HiFi-M8, and  other products, but here we are looking to speed things up via crowd-funding. So speed the main risk, which you can help mitigate by contributing today. Help us deliver the product as fast as possible!

You love Edmonton. We love Edmonton. We also love emojis — so we wanted to make some inspired by the people, places and preferences of our city. 
We’ve already designed a bunch of EDMOjis — including the Talus Dome, green onion cakes, the Gretzky statue, sad Don Iveson — and a rough draft of our app. 
We’d like to bring more than 60 of them to life … and to your iPhones. We’re hoping to raise $1,000 to finish our designs and the app. Complete with keyboard. 
Our goal? To sell the app for a very affordable price. (As in less than three bucks.) With the possibility of free updates to add new EDMOjis, of course! We'd love to hear your suggestions.

Hi, we are team STATUS, and thanks for checking out our project. With your help, we would love to make our idea a reality and revolutionize social communication.

We have always been intrigued by the parallels between colors and relationship statuses, our goal is to bring this to your everyday life in a discreet, yet easily recognizable medium.



Status is a lifestyle brand that allows self-expression in a whole new way. Inspired by the social media phenomenon, Status is a range of products that communicates through color and a social awareness of what these colours indicate.

Statusâ€™ range of mobile phone cases for iPhone 4 and 4S allow users to express their relationship status through this everyday product. 

Since the introduction of social media our relationship status has become public information for all to see. Translating this into an accessory that you constantly flash, makes these products a fun way to communicate without speaking and more importantly a clever conversation starter.



The Impact
Our goal is take the self-expression that the glorious internet has enabled us with and apply it in an tangible manner that are also fashion accessories. Increasing the ability for one to self express though a medium where social understanding and awareness is essential for its success.

With many more products on the way, our goal is for people to showcase their personality and STATUS to the people around them with STATUS products. We want our range of lifestyle products to change the way social interaction takes place and essentially taking the guess work out of your night out.

How Does it Work?
STATUS keeps it simple, with three statuses to suit any individuals personal situation.

AVAILABLE â€“ this vibrant shade of green is for those who are single and looking for love.

TAKEN â€“ the strong red styling of the TAKEN indicates you are in a relationship, off bounds and happily taken.

UNDECIDED â€“ the zesty orange color is directed at those who are neither here nor there. Not sure of their own STATUS and could be up for anything!

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>HOW DOES THE ZEUZ WIRELESS CHARGING SYSTEM WORK?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>TRANSMITTER / RECEIVER</strong></p>
<p>THE ZEUZ TRANSMITTER EMITS OF RF SIGNALS DIRECTED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE RECEIVER HAS BEEN DETECTED IN ADVANCE, THESE RF SIGNALS ARE CAPTURED BY THE HUNDREDS OF MICRO RECTENNAS THAT ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE ZEUZ RECEIVER, THROUGH AN ADVANCED PROCESS, THE RECEIVER CONVERTS THESE SIGNALS INTO THE ENERGY THAT YOUR DEVICE WILL USE TO BE CHARGED.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://imageshack.com/a/img923/8669/d6V5ZZ.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://imageshack.com/a/img922/2082/KtWLdz.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>SIGNAL REPEATER</strong></p>
<p>SO THAT THE SIGNAL EMITTED BY THE TRANSMITTER, IS ALWAYS OPTIMAL AND THE RECEIVER IS ABLE TO DELIVER THE MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY OF ENERGY, DURING THE CHARGING PROCESS, UP TO DISTANCES OF 80 FEET OR THROUGH WALLS AND OBSTACLES, IT IS REQUIRED TO USE SIGNAL REPEATERS, HAVING THIS DEVICE 2 MAIN FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD BE: REGENERATE THE SIGNAL IF IT HAS WEAKENED AND AMPLIFY THE SIGNAL AGAIN.</p>
<p>IT IS RECOMMENDED TO HAVE A MINIMUM OF 3 REPEATERS IN ORDER TO ALWAYS OBTAIN THE HIGHEST EFFICIENCY OF SIGNAL RECEPTION AND THUS ACHIEVE A FAST AND EFFECTIVE CHARGE ON THE DEVICES YOU WANT TO CHARGE.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://imageshack.com/a/img923/4856/ebTbXb.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>THIS PROCESS IS A MUCH MORE COMPLEX CARRIES WITH IT A DELICATE SOFTWARE WITH VERY DETAILED ALGORITHMS, VERY COMPLICATED ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS AND NEW COMPONENTS THAT HAD TO BE CREATED BOTH FOR THE TRANSMITTER AND FOR THE RECEIVER, BEING IN THIS LAST WHERE MOST OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IS CONCENTRATED.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>DESCRIPTION AND COMPONENTS OF THE ZEUZ SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p>THE ZEUZ WIRELESS DISTANCE CHARGING SYSTEM HAS 2 VERSIONS:</p>
<p>THE FIXED BASE SYSTEM FOR HOME, OFFICE, WAREHOUSE, WORKSHOP, ETC.</p>
<p>THE PORTABLE WIRELESS CHARGING SYSTEM. FOR CARRY IT TO ANY ANYWHERE.</p>
<p>THE ZEUZ WIRELESS CHARGING FIXED BASE SYSTEM IS COMPOSED OF THREE DEVICES: 1 TRANSMITTER, 1 REPEATER AND 1 RECEIVER. </p>
<p>OF THE FIXED BASE SYSTEM THERE ARE 2 TRANSMITTERS MODELS: THE GL-1 MODEL WITH ITS POWER TRANSMISSION FUNCTION AND THE GL-2 MODEL WHICH HAS AN INTEGRATED UPS-APS TYPE SYSTEM, WITH 2 POWERFUL BATTERIES OF 36,000 mAh AUTO RECHARGEABLE FOR SUPPORT.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://imageshack.com/a/img924/3521/68Ayps.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>THE ZEUZ PORTABLE WIRELESS CHARGING SYSTEM IS COMPOSED ONLY BY 2 DEVICES: 1 TRANSMITTER AND 1 RECEIVER, ITS REACH IS UP TO 6.5 FEET AND LIKE THE FIXED BASE SYSTEM, IT CAN ALSO WIRELESSLY CHARGE ALL TYPES OF LOW CONSUMPTION DEVICES, HAVING THE ADDITIONAL FABULOUS ADVANTAGE OF BEING TOTALLY PORTABLE.</p>
<p>FOR ITS FUNCTIONING THE PORTABLE SYSTEM HAS A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY OF 30,000 mAh OF LONG DURATION.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522268154/ck5j2srjx0qnegp2c1ih.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>EFFICIENCY OF THE CHARGING SYSTEM WIRELESS</strong></p>
<p>THE CHARGING EFFICIENCY MAY VARY DUE TO THE OBSTACLES ENCOUNTERED BY THE SIGNAL OF THE ZEUZ TRANSMITTER, ON ITS WAY TO THE RECEIVER. GENERALLY IN CLEAR AREAS THE CHARGING EFFECTIVENESS IS EXPECTED TO BE UP TO 80%. THIS EFFICIENCY VARIES AS THE DISTANCE IS INCREASING BETWEEN THE TRANSMITTER-RECEIVER OR WHEN THE SIGNAL HAS TO PASS THROUGH SEVERAL WALLS TO ARRIVE TO THE RECEIVER. TO ACHIEVE THE MAXIMUM EFFECTIVENESS OF CHARGINGING AT DISTANCE OR THROUGH WALLS SIGNAL REPEATERS ARE REQUIRED, AS A BASIC RULE IF IT COUNTS WITH 3 OR MORE REPEATERS WITHIN THE RANGE OF THE TRANSMITTER (80 FEET OF RANK) IT WILL ALWAYS MAINTAIN THE MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY OF CHARGING.</p>

PORTABLE WIRELESS CHARGER


THE ZEUZ WIRELESS CHARGE SYSTEM ALLOWS YOU TO CHARGE UP TO 3 DEVICES AT THE SAME TIME 


SYSTEM OF CHARGING FOR ALL THE LIFE
WE HAVE DESIGNED BOTH TRANSMITTERS (SYSTEM PORTABLE OF  CHARGE WIRELESS, SYSTEM OF CHARGE WITH BACK UP BATTERY GL2) SO THAT THEY ARE NOT DISPOSABLE, LIKE ALL THE CHARGING DEVICES THAT USE BATTERIES AND ARE CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET, THE CHANGE OF BATTERIES CAN BE MADE IN THE EASIEST WAY.
 CHARGING SYSTEM INTELLIGENT

THE RECEIVERS HAVE AN INTELLIGENT CHARGING SYSTEM IN SUCH A WAY THAT AT THE TIME OF BATTERY CHARGING, THE CHARGING PROCESS IS CUT, PROTECTING AND EXTENDING THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE BATTERY.
THE CABLE CHARGERS AND THE CONTACT BASES CONSUME ENERGY CONTINUOUSLY AS THEY ARE PERMANENTLY CONNECTED. ZEUZ'S INTELLIGENT CHARGING SYSTEM HIBERNATES WHEN NOT IN USE.

THANKS TO THIS TRUE WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY, YOUR SMARTPHONE, TABLET OR OTHER DEVICE WILL START TO CHARGE IMMEDIATELY. IT IS NOT IMPORTANT WHERE OR TO WHAT DISTANCE HAS IT, WITH THE CHARGE SYSTEM ZEUZ WILL NOT NECESSARY PLACE’S YOUR DEVICE ON ANY CONTACT BASE, NOR WILL IT BE NECESSARY TO PUT A SPECIAL COVER FOR CHARGE AND MUCH LESS SPEND A FORTUNE ON BUYING DIFFERENT COVERS FOR EACH OF YOUR DEVICES, WITH THE WIRELESS CHARGING SYSTEM ZEUZ NOT NEED TO BE AT A DISTANCE NEAR THE TRANSMITTER, IT IS MORE NEITHER NECESSARY TO KNOW WHERE THE ENERGY TRANSMITTER IS. SIMPLY BY PLACING THE RECEIVER ON YOUR SMARTPHONE, TABLET OR ANY OTHER DEVICE, YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN CHARGING AND YOU CAN CONTINUE USING IT.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE, IT'S THAT EASY.
ZEUZ AT HOME
 
ZEUZ IN THE OFFICE  
IS IT POSSIBLE TO CHARGE A DEVICE THROUGH RF?
THE CHARGING OF OUR DEVICES WIRELESSLY AT LONG DISTANCE, IS NOT AND WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE, BY MEANS OF THE INDUCTIVE LOAD OR THE MAGNETIC RESONANCE. (CHARGING PADS, CONTACT BASES)
THERE ARE CURRENTLY 4 TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, WHICH ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY MARKET RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) TECHNOLOGY FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF ENERGY SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY, THESE COMPANIES ARE: ENERGOUS, OSSIA AND POWERCAST AND THE STARTUP ZEUZ AG.
SO REAL IS THIS TECHNOLOGY THAT SOME OF THESE COMPANIES ARE ALREADY LISTED ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE IN THE UNITED STATES.
THE FIRST COMPANIES, ITS COMMERCIAL FOCUS IS AIMED AT DEVICE MANUFACTURERS, ONLY THE STARTUP ZEUZ, IS ABOUT TO START COMMERCIALIZING, THE FIRST REMOTE WIRELESS CHARGING SYSTEM, DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMER.

COMPATIBILITY WITH MULTIPLE DEVICES
ZEUS IS REALLY THE ONLY WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY WITH WHICH YOU CAN CHARGE SMARTPHONES, TABLETS, ACTION CAMERAS, DRONES AND ANY OTHER DEVICE TO DISTANCE OF UP TO 80 FEET.
 


THE CONNECTORS THAT WILL BE INSTALLED IN THE RECEIVERS ARE THE MOST USED BY THE DEVICE MANUFACTURERS, WE ASK THAT AS SOON AS YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY, CONTACT US AT EMAIL: powerwirelesschargezeuz@gmail.comGIVE US YOUR SUPPORT DATA; TELL US WHAT REWARD YOU SUPPORTED AND WHAT KIND OF CONNECTOR OR CONNECTORS YOU NEED TO BE SENT. 



 
 




 
APPLICATION (APP)
WE THINK ABOUT MAKING AN APPLICATION TO COMPLETELY CONTROL THE ZEUZ SYSTEM, BUT WE QUITLY ASKED OURSELVES.
WHAT IF OUR SMARTPHONE OR TABLET DOES NOT HAVE A BATTERY?
¿HOW DO WE OPEN THE APPLICATION TO CHARGE OUR DEVICES?
¿HOW WILL WE CHARGE DEVICES TO WHICH THE APPLICATION CAN NOT BE DOWNLOADED, SUCH AS DRONES, CAMERAS, HEADPHONES, SPEAKERS, ETC, ETC?
ANALYZING THESE POINTS WE DECIDED THAT THE APPLICATION THAT WE WILL UPLOAD WILL BE ABLE TO ONLY GIVE INFORMATION OF THE CHARGING SYSTEM AND TO CONTROL CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS.
THE APP CAN BE DOWNLOADED IN SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS THAT HAVE ANDROID AND IOS OPERATIONAL SYSTEM.
WE WANT ZEUZ TO BE THE EASIEST TO USE… SIMPLY CONNECT IT TO YOUR DEVICE AND DONE.
 


 
TECHNOLOGY AND FEATURES
 
HOW DOES THE ZEUZ WIRELESS CHARGING SYSTEM WORK?
TRANSMITTER / RECEIVER
THE ZEUZ TRANSMITTER EMITS OF RF SIGNALS DIRECTED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE RECEIVER HAS BEEN DETECTED IN ADVANCE, THESE RF SIGNALS ARE CAPTURED BY THE HUNDREDS OF MICRO RECTENNAS THAT ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE ZEUZ RECEIVER, THROUGH AN ADVANCED PROCESS, THE RECEIVER CONVERTS THESE SIGNALS INTO THE ENERGY THAT YOUR DEVICE WILL USE TO BE CHARGED.


SIGNAL REPEATER
SO THAT THE SIGNAL EMITTED BY THE TRANSMITTER, IS ALWAYS OPTIMAL AND THE RECEIVER IS ABLE TO DELIVER THE MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY OF ENERGY, DURING THE CHARGING PROCESS, UP TO DISTANCES OF 80 FEET OR THROUGH WALLS AND OBSTACLES, IT IS REQUIRED TO USE SIGNAL REPEATERS, HAVING THIS DEVICE 2 MAIN FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD BE: REGENERATE THE SIGNAL IF IT HAS WEAKENED AND AMPLIFY THE SIGNAL AGAIN.
IT IS RECOMMENDED TO HAVE A MINIMUM OF 3 REPEATERS IN ORDER TO ALWAYS OBTAIN THE HIGHEST EFFICIENCY OF SIGNAL RECEPTION AND THUS ACHIEVE A FAST AND EFFECTIVE CHARGE ON THE DEVICES YOU WANT TO CHARGE.

THIS PROCESS IS A MUCH MORE COMPLEX CARRIES WITH IT A DELICATE SOFTWARE WITH VERY DETAILED ALGORITHMS, VERY COMPLICATED ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS AND NEW COMPONENTS THAT HAD TO BE CREATED BOTH FOR THE TRANSMITTER AND FOR THE RECEIVER, BEING IN THIS LAST WHERE MOST OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IS CONCENTRATED.
DESCRIPTION AND COMPONENTS OF THE ZEUZ SYSTEM
THE ZEUZ WIRELESS DISTANCE CHARGING SYSTEM HAS 2 VERSIONS:
THE FIXED BASE SYSTEM FOR HOME, OFFICE, WAREHOUSE, WORKSHOP, ETC.
THE PORTABLE WIRELESS CHARGING SYSTEM. FOR CARRY IT TO ANY ANYWHERE.
THE ZEUZ WIRELESS CHARGING FIXED BASE SYSTEM IS COMPOSED OF THREE DEVICES: 1 TRANSMITTER, 1 REPEATER AND 1 RECEIVER. 
OF THE FIXED BASE SYSTEM THERE ARE 2 TRANSMITTERS MODELS: THE GL-1 MODEL WITH ITS POWER TRANSMISSION FUNCTION AND THE GL-2 MODEL WHICH HAS AN INTEGRATED UPS-APS TYPE SYSTEM, WITH 2 POWERFUL BATTERIES OF 36,000 mAh AUTO RECHARGEABLE FOR SUPPORT.

THE ZEUZ PORTABLE WIRELESS CHARGING SYSTEM IS COMPOSED ONLY BY 2 DEVICES: 1 TRANSMITTER AND 1 RECEIVER, ITS REACH IS UP TO 6.5 FEET AND LIKE THE FIXED BASE SYSTEM, IT CAN ALSO WIRELESSLY CHARGE ALL TYPES OF LOW CONSUMPTION DEVICES, HAVING THE ADDITIONAL FABULOUS ADVANTAGE OF BEING TOTALLY PORTABLE.
FOR ITS FUNCTIONING THE PORTABLE SYSTEM HAS A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY OF 30,000 mAh OF LONG DURATION.

EFFICIENCY OF THE CHARGING SYSTEM WIRELESS
THE CHARGING EFFICIENCY MAY VARY DUE TO THE OBSTACLES ENCOUNTERED BY THE SIGNAL OF THE ZEUZ TRANSMITTER, ON ITS WAY TO THE RECEIVER. GENERALLY IN CLEAR AREAS THE CHARGING EFFECTIVENESS IS EXPECTED TO BE UP TO 80%. THIS EFFICIENCY VARIES AS THE DISTANCE IS INCREASING BETWEEN THE TRANSMITTER-RECEIVER OR WHEN THE SIGNAL HAS TO PASS THROUGH SEVERAL WALLS TO ARRIVE TO THE RECEIVER. TO ACHIEVE THE MAXIMUM EFFECTIVENESS OF CHARGINGING AT DISTANCE OR THROUGH WALLS SIGNAL REPEATERS ARE REQUIRED, AS A BASIC RULE IF IT COUNTS WITH 3 OR MORE REPEATERS WITHIN THE RANGE OF THE TRANSMITTER (80 FEET OF RANK) IT WILL ALWAYS MAINTAIN THE MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY OF CHARGING.

Why do I hear a noise when I use an encrypted call?When an encrypted call is initiated, if one of the parties does not push the encryption button on the earbuds, both parties' calls become noises. If you turn off encryption button, the call will change to normal mode. Both parties will turn on the encryption button to enter the standard confidential call. 4. The sound is abnormal when listening to radio and music.Please check whether the encryption button is turned on. After it is turned on, the voice you heard has been encrypted. Please turn off the encryption button. 5. How to charge the headset?Please refer to the product instruction manual. 6. What are operators supported when using encryption?In principle, the operators are not limited, but in the use of CDMA system, the effect will be slightly worse. 7. Why does the headset say ""Failed to enter advanced mode?""It may be due to bad mobile phone signals, unstable mobile network, and other reasons that cause encrypted communications to fail. First, you can press the encryption key again and test again, so that the other party can try to identify again. Before you try again, you can try to increase the volume of the local headset so that the headset can more easily recognize the encrypted signal. If the retry still fails, both parties can use the fixed-frequency encryption mode to talk, and the encrypted call can also be achieved. 8. In the advanced encryption mode, I heard a ""click"" sound.This is a process that enhances the strength of encryption. Calls can be performed normally, and they will not appear when fixed-frequency encryption is used.",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Bolt Survey is a smart phone app that
allows students to have a greater say in their schools and community. Bolt
Survey will be a user generated app in which users can post questions for other
Bolt Survey users to answer.</p>
<p>My name is Alex Ahn, and I am a rising
senior at Northfield Mount Hermon High School. I first came up with the concept
of this app when I saw how difficult it was to engage students in the important
issues of my school. I have watched my own school conduct countless surveys to
try to capture student feedback, but most of the time, the school had trouble
getting responses from a lot of students. I realized then this was part of a
bigger problem, where students have difficulty voicing their thoughts. Thus, I
wanted to create a simple survey App that made it easy and fun for students to share
their thoughts about everything from net neutrality to school uniforms. </p>
<p>In order to make my idea a reality, I
teamed up with K-Survey, a Korean-based app developer, during my summer
vacation. Together, we have designed an app that focuses on simplicity,
precision, and speed in collecting and processing answers to increase student participation.
In short, we believe Bolt Survey is a powerful tool that will bring students
closer to one another, their schools, and their communities. </p>
<p>We are running and IndieGoGo campaign
because we need your help to fund the remaining stages of development.</p>

answer and submit questions on a wide-range of issues that interest and affect
students.

<p>Once students answer a
question, they can immediately see how other students answered as well as links
to related questions and topics.</p>
<p>Our goal with Bolt Survey is
to motivate students to have a say in their school and the world around them.
To encourage participation, we have structured the app so that students gain
experience points by completing questions. These experience points can be traded in for incentives and prizes.</p>
<p>This IndieGoGo campaign will
fund the development of an early version of the app in which questions are open
to all student users. However, in later versions we plan to create
school-specific sections so that the app can be used within local communities
to increase student engagement. </p>

At GetNord, we pride ourselves as one of the leading pioneers in the rugged smartphone industry, and we’re here to bring you our latest smartphone - LYNX.After years of feedback and comments from our users, we’ve designed the most robust and durable phone for the most extreme. A no-nonsense smartphone to withstand the elements, a compact but extremely tough phone with the strongest screen on the market, long-lasting battery with no bells and whistles, clean Android interface with various accessories from our partners RAM Mounts.The ""No-worries"" Smartphone  Will LYNX work with my service provider?We’ve made several versions of LYNX with different sets of cellular frequencies for different locations across the world. Have a look below to see if our phones will work on your service, but if you’re still unsure email us at: support1@getnord.com . If your service provider gives you a working GSM SIM card (ask for Nano SIM size), we will ship you the right model according to your address. PRESS Here you can download Getnord Lynx press pack. Just click this link to receive (1GB) your press pack, including official press release, some imagery and video! MADE FOR WORK AND ADVENTURES  STRONGEST SCREENLYNX has the thicket screen on the market, our screens measure at 1.8mm in thickness. Built to last and withstand and unexpected drops and accidents. We don’t believe in any special technology when it comes to strength, the thickness is essential for an unbreakable screen. POWERED TO LASTThe LYNX battery capacity can last for days without charging with normal usage of the phone making it perfect to use for long journeys and for the times you have no access to electricity. With a 6000mAh battery, even the most consuming task will use the smallest amount of power. WIRELESS CHARGINGLike most modern smartphones, we’ve made the LYNX Qi certified and added the capability to wireless charge your device. Our magnetic mount works as a wireless charger. You can purchase genuine GetNord charging pad accessories from our campaign page or use a Qi-certified charging device with no less than a 2A output. TAP, PAY, DONE- NFCContactless payment makes purchases on the go easier. Paying in stores with Google Pay or any Bank application on your phone must work with NFC (Near-field communication) and software on your phone has to be Play Protect certified.But don’t worry, we’ve done both for you. CLEAN OSThe majority of manufacturers and carriers often load phones with their own apps. If you don’t use them, they clutter your system and can even drain your battery in the background.At GetNord, we know how to make phones, not apps. With LYNX you will get a virgin Android Oreo OS with basic applications and Google packages. Everything in Google Play is ready for download in a matter of seconds - Why should we push apps that the majority don’t need. LOCK & ROLL  / MAGNETIC MOUNT Wireless charging cradle with magnetic lock. Patented RAM ball and socket system.Tough and Waterproof. Can be used for offroad, ATV and UTV. DESIGNED IN BARCELONAWe believe that beauty and aesthetics are always relevant to people no matter whether for work or pleasure. Beautiful things make people happy.   Knowing the importance of aesthetics and understanding that we are just a pragmatic engineers we asked for a help from those who know the best.EUIPO Design Registration Certificate No 005802782-0001 Partnership with RAM MountsWe do what we do best so we’ve partnered up with those that know best, RAM mounts. RAM is the revolutionary and leading universal ball and socket mounting system that allows you to mount anything, anywhere. RAM’s family of more than 900 interchangeable accessories will no doubt have a solution to any problem. Recognized and accepted by the U.S. Patent Office, RAM is the only universal ball-and-socket SYSTEM that will hold tremendous amounts of weight in high vibration applications for military, commercial and private use. Just RAM It!Our perks will come with RAM Mounts so you can mount your LYNX and use it as a dash cam, sat nav, body camera and more. Perks Project timelineSpecifications Meet The Team

<p>You’ve got an iPad loaded with amazing synthesizer &amp; music creation apps, but connecting your controller creates a tangled mess and your mobile device isn't so mobile anymore.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><span class=""notranlsate""><h2>Thank you for checking out the launch of my very first skincare product, Cell Quench.</h2>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p><strong>My name is Mary Schook. Since 2005 I have been working as a licensed esthetician on lab rats, I mean clients, at my alternative anti-aging center in New York City, Beauty By Mary Schook, LLC. Prior to treating the countless faces that make pilgrimages to us from across the globe, I was one of the most sought after fashion makeup artists and image makers in the industry. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>I naturally gravitated toward skincare after pioneering lash extensions in the US because customers were going to professionals that would burn, heat and peel the skin. I noticed that initially they all looked great, but through time their skin looked thinner and older. It was important for me to figure out why and fix it!<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>I wasn't the only person to make this observation. In 2008 Estee Lauder's Chief Scientific Officer announced that we have been treating skin entirely wrong. Skincare of the future is about nurturing the skin and feeding the cells what they need, not creating damage to produce temporary effects and brittle collagen. <br/></strong></p>
<h2><strong>A NEW PRODUCT IS BORN</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Because I am also now one of the leaders in stem cell growth factors in the skincare industry, I was introduced to a very special plant stem cell culture by a raw materials company. I eventually tested it on hundreds of clients. EVERY single person reported satisfactory results with my formulation and told me their skin was hydrated, softer, firmer, brighter and overall happier! There is nothing they would change about the product and they all wanted it IMMEDIATELY. In all of my years as a skinspert and product tester I have never had a unanimous response quite like this. <br/></strong></p>
<h2><strong>INVESTMENT STORY<br/></strong></h2>
<p><strong>I decided to take Cell Quench to several investors (and was introduced to many others), but no one seemed to have the vision that I did. I didn't want to make a cream. The particles in creams are too big and they generally don't work. Others wanted me to put my name on it or create an entire line just to create a line, but for me the customer comes first and creating a product just to creat a product is silly. That's why there are so many lines out there with average products and one or two all-stars. Putting my name on something also just seems strange to me right now.  Other products will certainly follow, but for now dry skin has been our customer's #1 complaint aside from jowls and hyperpigmentation. Cell Quench seems to help alleviate the appearance of all of those things. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>I can't say for sure, but the second product I will most likely introduce will be an anti-acne product, which will help relieve the more that 80% of people that suffer with this problem at some point in their lives. For now I want to focus on what has been extensively tested and what works. <br/></strong></p>
<h2><strong>CELL QUENCH DETAILS<br/></strong></h2>
<h3><strong>WHAT IS CELL QUENCH? <br/></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Cell Quench is a light nourishing serum comprised of the most advanced plant stem cell culture technology available on the market. <br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK? </strong></h3>

<h3><strong><br/>ARE THERE CHEMICALS IN CELL QUENCH?<br/></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Cell Quench is ALL-NATURAL! We don't have to mix a bunch of preservatives in our products. One reason Cell Quench is well preserved is because it is packaged in Violet Glass. Violet glass not only protects ingredients, but enhances them as demonstrated in the tomato experiment in the video and the attached photos. <br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong><br/>AREN'T THERE ALREADY STEM CELL PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET?<br/></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Plant stem cells were first introduced around 2008 with the Swiss Apple Stem Cell. Cell Quench is the most effective plant stem cell technology available on the market. In addition many cosmetic companies will put ingredients in their products at super small percentages for marketing. I want the consumer to get the most bang for their buck!<br/></strong></p>
<h3>
<strong> </strong><strong>WHEN WILL I GET THE PRODUCT?</strong>
</h3>
<p><strong><strong>My goal is to get Cell Quench out to market as soon as possible once we reach our funding goal. It takes eight weeks to get the raw material upon ordering and another two to fill it and ship it. <br/></strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>HOW MUCH DO I GET AND HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?<br/></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Each full size serum is 10ml. Because the serum is packaged using a glass roller ball there is no excess or wasted serum. One can easily get 1-2 months use out of each bottle depending on your desired use and results. <br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong><br/>WHAT SKIN TYPES DOES CELL QUENCH WORK WITH?<br/></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Everyone! We've seen the most dramatic changes from people with sun damage and dehydration. What made me happiest is that it was also gentle on sensitive skin and even the dryest of clients that can't seem to get hydrated. <strong>Most testers reported that they didn't need a cream after using Cell Quench. </strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong><br/>A LITTLE SIDE NOTE<br/></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Remember there is no miracle in a bottle. Cell Quench is an amazing tool in the battle of aging, but anti-aging and age prevention begins from within. As I always say 'Eat a Cheeto, look like a Cheeto'.<br/></strong></p>

Who am I?
My name is Mary Schook. Since 2005 I have been working as a licensed esthetician on lab rats, I mean clients, at my alternative anti-aging center in New York City, Beauty By Mary Schook, LLC. Prior to treating the countless faces that make pilgrimages to us from across the globe, I was one of the most sought after fashion makeup artists and image makers in the industry. 
I naturally gravitated toward skincare after pioneering lash extensions in the US because customers were going to professionals that would burn, heat and peel the skin. I noticed that initially they all looked great, but through time their skin looked thinner and older. It was important for me to figure out why and fix it!
I wasn't the only person to make this observation. In 2008 Estee Lauder's Chief Scientific Officer announced that we have been treating skin entirely wrong. Skincare of the future is about nurturing the skin and feeding the cells what they need, not creating damage to produce temporary effects and brittle collagen. 
A NEW PRODUCT IS BORN
Because I am also now one of the leaders in stem cell growth factors in the skincare industry, I was introduced to a very special plant stem cell culture by a raw materials company. I eventually tested it on hundreds of clients. EVERY single person reported satisfactory results with my formulation and told me their skin was hydrated, softer, firmer, brighter and overall happier! There is nothing they would change about the product and they all wanted it IMMEDIATELY. In all of my years as a skinspert and product tester I have never had a unanimous response quite like this. 
INVESTMENT STORY
I decided to take Cell Quench to several investors (and was introduced to many others), but no one seemed to have the vision that I did. I didn't want to make a cream. The particles in creams are too big and they generally don't work. Others wanted me to put my name on it or create an entire line just to create a line, but for me the customer comes first and creating a product just to creat a product is silly. That's why there are so many lines out there with average products and one or two all-stars. Putting my name on something also just seems strange to me right now.  Other products will certainly follow, but for now dry skin has been our customer's #1 complaint aside from jowls and hyperpigmentation. Cell Quench seems to help alleviate the appearance of all of those things. 
I can't say for sure, but the second product I will most likely introduce will be an anti-acne product, which will help relieve the more that 80% of people that suffer with this problem at some point in their lives. For now I want to focus on what has been extensively tested and what works. 
CELL QUENCH DETAILS
WHAT IS CELL QUENCH? 
Cell Quench is a light nourishing serum comprised of the most advanced plant stem cell culture technology available on the market. 
HOW DOES IT WORK? 
The plant stem cell cultures boost the antioxidant levels in the cells, which helps to calm inflammation (a leading cause of aging) and protect the skin from free radicals, which can come from sun, pollution and many other sources.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>WHO AM I?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Tracey Rodriguez.  My background has been in business development, customer service, sales and the fitness industry for the past 15 years.  I trained and became a certified fitness trainer in 2003 and is certified through NESTA.  I Founded Fitness Lady 30 Minute Fitness Centers.  The first location opened in 2004 and a second location in 2005.  Both locations have since been sold to take the BOOT CAMPS to the next level.  I was a key note speaker for the City of Phoenix in health and fitness.   I am the author of 22 books in the health and fitness industry.  I am the founder and creator of the NEW 3 Phase dietDECK.  I am featured in Robert Kiyosaki's book ""Rich Dad Success Stories"" published in October of 2003.  A quote from this book says it all ""we never lost our dreams, we just found a way to make them come true"".  This is what I have done and the passion I have with all my business projects.  =))</p>
<p><strong>WHY HELP THIS PROJECT?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, I want to thank all of you for checking out my Indiegogo project! You have already contributed to the project just by visiting my page.</p>
3 Phase dietDECK is a current product that I had developed a few years back to help my clients signed up in my <a href=""http://www.ladiesfitnessbootcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ladies Fitness Boot Camp</a> classes have a easy &amp; fun diet plan.  I have sold over 4000 copies since September of 2008.In the intro video I have shared with you what the cards look like.  I now want to take this concept and make into a ""Online App"" to bring to the world!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p><strong>Here are a few testimonials from past clients:</strong></p>
<p><em>The Phase 3-Phase diet plan is great! .....  The plan is so easy to follow and takes the guesswork out of what I should be eating daily.  It provides you with just the right amount of food to keep you energized through-out the day and I can honestly say that I am never hungry.  All I do is design my meals around the list of foods provided in the plan, and there is such a variety of options, that I am never bored.  The best part of being on the 3-Phase diet plan ....is that when I put on my black suit in preparation for my interview last Friday, my pants slide on with ease.  I cannot tell you how thrilled I was because I really wanted to wear that suit and be comfortable in it.  I believe I was able to achieve this by sticking to the plan.  ----Margie W </em></p>
<p><em>I have been working out for the last several months and have seen results but not like I wanted.  I can tell you that without the help of the 3 Phase dietDECK I would not have been able to keep going.  I am now getting the results that I want and I do not have to think about it.  This plan has imprinted on my brain exaclty what I need to do each day.   ----- Nai</em></p>
<p><em>I have been in the boot camp program for 2 years now and have had amazing results. I was at a platue for a few months and decided to do the case study for the new 3 Phase dietDECK. In the 8 weeks I felt amazing and was never hungry. I ended up losing 13 inches and 9 pounds in the study. I am going to remain on the plan to finish reaching my fitness goals. I love this product. Very easy to use and I was never hungry, EVER. -------Sandy</em></p>

<p>When we developed the Python reinforced charging cables last year and backed it with a lifetime warranty, we had no idea that so many would copy our ideas  in their cables. But there is more to what makes Python the superior cable that it is. A lot more! We have also learned a lot in the past many months and have made great changes to the Python cable. The result is strength, resistance and durability in a charging cable to last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Python cables are the fastest cables ever and are the world’s longest MFi and USB-IF certified cables and all are backed with our stunning customer service too.</p>

<p>What makes Python so strong is the Reinforced braided PVC throughout the cable. What is Kevlar®? It's the stuff that bulletproof vests are made of. It is the most powerful and strongest material in the world.</p>

<p>We know you don’t always have a lot of time to charge your devices that’s why we engineered Python cables to charge your devices at the speed of light. It is up to twice as fast as regular charging cables, which allows you to top-off your battery quickly during those times you’re away from the wall.</p>
<p><strong>Twice the speed of a regular cable</strong></p>
<p>Many cheaper cables go with thinner wires to cut cost, and they can’t handle enough current to charge newer, power-hungry devices at full speed. A cheaply made cable can also hamper data-transfer speeds. The many leading brands cables we tested had 19% slower data-read speeds than Python, and the slowest-charging cable conducted 41% less current than the Python cable.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""349"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/vUHFF3yMRv4"" width=""620""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Buying after market USB cables will pretty much always result in getting cheap quality 30/30 cables and your device will barely break 500mAh when it charges, maybe even less. This isn't the only issue though. After you use a cable for a while it eventually stress near the plugs and causes poor connectivity between your device and the wire.</p>
<p>Python cables Use 18AWG silver-plated copper cables for lower resistance and faster charging than any other cable out there and offer high speed charging at 3.1A, 3.2v - 20v &amp; 18W and data sync up to 10Gbps and our new Python USB-IF Certified USB-C to USB-C Quick Charge 3.1 Generation 2 cable with up to 40 gigabits per second and 100 watts of power, gain support for Thunderbolt 3, and benefit from the ability to simultaneously connect to two 4K 60 Hertz display or one 5K 60 Hertz display. , which would save you a lot of time to do other things...</p>

<p>Python was born out of the necessity for a reliable and efficient charging solution, to de-clutter and to de-stress your life! The tough 3M braiding material keep the Python Cable inherently tangle-free. </p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>We’ve worked hard over the last year to get the Python cable to this point and we've successfully built and delivered beautiful, reliable fast cables to backers. We have also learnt a lot. Found mistakes, improved on all fronts and are proud to have delivered on our promises for reliable solid products and great customer service. As we continue this journey we are introducing new additions to the Python Family of Cables and we have completed critical milestones with the help of many knowledgeable people. We are continuing with our very reputable manufacturer who offers great engineering support and development tools. What remains is completing the manufacturing phase and so we're confident that manufacturing risk is at a minimum.</p>
<p>We are almost ready to push the green button and start production with our manufacturer. We have done our testing and certification and cannot wait to put it into your hands. We anticipate a manufacturing period of 6 weeks from the end of the campaign to start shipping Python to you. This is possible because we’ve already completed our R&amp;D, obtained our Apple MFi, USB-IF and Quick Charge certification, have a massive order of connectors on the way and the rest we can complete with your help and have the cables shipped to you 6 weeks after the end of this campaign and no later than October 30th, 2017.</p>

This Certified cable works with 99.999% of all devices
Last June, having been fed up with wasting money on weak flimsy and gimmicky uncertified cables that don’t last, we launched the Python cable, the world’s first charging cable with Tough Reinforced Braided PVC Skin for superior strength and backed it with a lifetime warranty.

Then we followed with the Python USB-C Quick Charge 3.1 IF-Certified with Thunderbolt-3 support cable to a rave review. 

USB-IF QC 3.1 Generation-2 USB-C cable with Thunderbolt 3 Support​
 
When we developed the Python reinforced charging cables last year and backed it with a lifetime warranty, we had no idea that so many would copy our ideas  in their cables. But there is more to what makes Python the superior cable that it is. A lot more! We have also learned a lot in the past many months and have made great changes to the Python cable. The result is strength, resistance and durability in a charging cable to last a lifetime.
Python cables are the fastest cables ever and are the world’s longest MFi and USB-IF certified cables and all are backed with our stunning customer service too.

What makes Python so strong is the Reinforced braided PVC throughout the cable. What is Kevlar®? It's the stuff that bulletproof vests are made of. It is the most powerful and strongest material in the world.


We know you don’t always have a lot of time to charge your devices that’s why we engineered Python cables to charge your devices at the speed of light. It is up to twice as fast as regular charging cables, which allows you to top-off your battery quickly during those times you’re away from the wall.
Twice the speed of a regular cable
Many cheaper cables go with thinner wires to cut cost, and they can’t handle enough current to charge newer, power-hungry devices at full speed. A cheaply made cable can also hamper data-transfer speeds. The many leading brands cables we tested had 19% slower data-read speeds than Python, and the slowest-charging cable conducted 41% less current than the Python cable.

Buying after market USB cables will pretty much always result in getting cheap quality 30/30 cables and your device will barely break 500mAh when it charges, maybe even less. This isn't the only issue though. After you use a cable for a while it eventually stress near the plugs and causes poor connectivity between your device and the wire.
Python cables Use 18AWG silver-plated copper cables for lower resistance and faster charging than any other cable out there and offer high speed charging at 3.1A, 3.2v - 20v & 18W and data sync up to 10Gbps and our new Python USB-IF Certified USB-C to USB-C Quick Charge 3.1 Generation 2 cable with up to 40 gigabits per second and 100 watts of power, gain support for Thunderbolt 3, and benefit from the ability to simultaneously connect to two 4K 60 Hertz display or one 5K 60 Hertz display. , which would save you a lot of time to do other things...

Python was born out of the necessity for a reliable and efficient charging solution, to de-clutter and to de-stress your life! The tough 3M braiding material keep the Python Cable inherently tangle-free.

Risks and challenges
We’ve worked hard over the last year to get the Python cable to this point and we've successfully built and delivered beautiful, reliable fast cables to backers. We have also learnt a lot. Found mistakes, improved on all fronts and are proud to have delivered on our promises for reliable solid products and great customer service. As we continue this journey we are introducing new additions to the Python Family of Cables and we have completed critical milestones with the help of many knowledgeable people. We are continuing with our very reputable manufacturer who offers great engineering support and development tools. What remains is completing the manufacturing phase and so we're confident that manufacturing risk is at a minimum.
We are almost ready to push the green button and start production with our manufacturer. We have done our testing and certification and cannot wait to put it into your hands. We anticipate a manufacturing period of 6 weeks from the end of the campaign to start shipping Python to you. This is possible because we’ve already completed our R&D, obtained our Apple MFi, USB-IF and Quick Charge certification, have a massive order of connectors on the way and the rest we can complete with your help and have the cables shipped to you 6 weeks after the end of this campaign and no later than October 30th, 2017.",25.0,2,"3 Campaigns

It allows you to be on top of your notifications with unique, lighting design, providing the possibilities to personalize your device according to your personality. Please, meet SPECTRE.• Italiano • 국어 • 中文 • Pyсский • 日本語 •Our Spectre line-up is available for the following iPhone models: iPhone 5/5S/SE/6/6S/7 and iPhone 6/6S/7 Plus. You can pre order SPECTRE now saving 50% its retail price.Imaginative and inspiring were our goals.​Our result: a new range of case designs that we’ve developed in partnership with industry giants Jean Baptiste and Jama Jurabaev.Introducing designs of Andrew Bond.All business and no frills. No messing around here. Simply put, what you see is what you get.Fierce, motivated and powerful. The dragon inspired this SPECTRE to breathe its fiery glow. Open up your imagination and attach a piece of the mysterious to your everyday life.Delicate, feminine and the embodiment of class. The organic nature of this case pays tribute to the natural beauty found on Earth, accented against the force that brings life to all: light. This SPECTRE will awaken your senses.Majestic, graceful and downright beautiful. Butterfly motifs dominate this design and are accented by the central feature of SPECTRE: light. Think reality with a dash of magic! Sincere sensuality is expressed through floral prints on the backs of butterfly wings. This combination creates a luminous touch and with raised metallic threads that contrast against stripes, triangles and geometric shapes, this SPECTRE gracefully flutters to life.Six sides of simplicity and genius. The high-tech world is chalk full of clean lines and perfectly crafted shapes, much like this Hexagon SPECTRE. Whether you’re in the tech industry or you’re someone who appreciates its beauty, this SPECTRE is for you.Noticeably unnoticeable. When you want to turn heads but don’t want anyone to see your phone. This SPECTRE is inspired by the rugged armour that protects servicemen and women around the world. Get tough and get camouflaged.Meet designs of Jean Baptiste PetricoulI.If you want to see what living and working in over a dozen different countries does to an artist’s influence, look no further than the designs of Jean Baptiste PetricoulI. This up and comer has some significant impact already under his belt and what you see is just the tip of the iceberg.This tropical treat is a super-sweet way to give your iPhone the Hawaiian experience. The classic pineapple is given a fresh look with contemporary lines and SPECTRE’s glow will have anyone and everyone nearby yearning for the tropics.Not everyone looks good in a pair of leather pants, but just about every iPhone looks better in a Prince SPECTRE. This SPECTRE pays homage to the great musician with a subdued yet stately design. Rock ‘n roll.Pop icon. Musical genius. The great, David Bowie. The signature Bowie shock of hair and strike of lightning will surge new life into your iPhone and is perfect for any lover of music.This SPECTRE is not your father but it is really cool nevertheless. Here, the Dark Side meets the light and when you attach SPECTRE to your iPhone, you’ll instantly know that the force is strong in this oneConcept artist. Illustrator. Matte painter.

The results will be incorporated into SBCL and released into Public Domain as usual.

anything.  The same lock is also used for some non-compiler activities

compilation. Even if you don't care about parallel compilation as
such, there are other unfortunate consequences: CLOS dispatch (before
caches settle down) can involve compiling code. Most of the time BCL
is a tiny annoyance, but sometimes it can be a real headache. Sometimes it is an insurmountable barrier.</span> )<br/>

I've been working on SBCL for about 8 years, and have around 1400 commits in the current tree.My goal is to make SBCL the number one open source Common Lisp implementation.Maybe 30% of my work on SBCL has been funded more-or-less-directly by my customers, and the rest I've essentially funded out of my own pocket. During the past couple of years -- since the mortgage crises, pretty much -- consulting gigs have been getting thinner on the ground, and I'm looking for a better way to fund future SBCL development.This is my first experiment in crowdfunding: if it succeeds, there are other SBCL projects that I plan to fund in the same way -- hopefully involving other SBCL developers as well.

Everyone Loves or Hates Threads
SBCL has native threads on several POSIX platforms, but they aren't quite as robust as they should be outside Linux, and even on Linux the threading API is few pieces short of what I'd like to see there.
Individual platforms have issues of their own, but the major problem shared by most non-Linux platforms is our implementation of mutexes, and their misbehaviour when it comes to interrupt safety. 

The API is missing timeout arguments from several functions, read/write locks, and notification objects on semaphores... to start with.

Introducing Fair Spinlocks
I plan to improve things on non-Linux platforms by:
Replacing SBCL's mutexes on non-Linux platforms with a ones based on fair spinlocks. My proof of concept implementation shows that this is viable: in my tests fair spinlocks incorporating a backoff consistently outperform POSIX mutexes on Darwin.
Implementing a userspace solution for semaphores and condition variables for non-Linux platforms.

Futexes will remain in use on Linux: while it would be nice to use identical code on both Linux and elsewhere, futexes are simply too good for our purposes to not to use them.The initial funding goal is enough to get this done. The results will be incorporated into SBCL and released into Public Domain as usual. (I have already developed the necessary extensions to ticket spinlock algorithm, allowing threads waiting for a spinlock to be interrupted without holding up the queue. What remains is integrating the work with SBCL, and dealing with semaphores and condition variables.)The Missing Bits and PiecesEven if you only use SBCL only on Linux, please consider participating. If I exceed the initial goal, I will also be able to work on:
At $4,000: adding timeout arguments to all blocking functions in the threading API.

At $5,000: implementing read/write locks.
At $6,000: implementing semaphore notification objects.
At $8,000: generally refactoring the threading API (while of course retaining backwards compatibility.)
At $12,000: new library called MADEIRA will be 
implemented, which is to be a compatibility library for Common Lisp 
implementations focused on threading and bits not covered by either CFFI
 or USOCKET. (Basic things like access to command-line arguments, environment, EXIT, etc. Bordeaux-Threads -like functionality, but better defined, with sharper edges. CAS. Remains to be seen how general I can make the support, though. Running external programs -- probably somewhere between TRIVIAL-SHELL and SBCL's RUN-PROGRAM in functionality.)

At $16,000: scope of the ""big compiler lock"" in SBCL will 
be curtailed, so that it will be possible to compile things in parallel. (What is the big compiler lock? SBCL grabs a lock when it compiles
anything.  The same lock is also used for some non-compiler activities
like modifying the class graph. This lock prevents parallel
compilation. Even if you don't care about parallel compilation as
such, there are other unfortunate consequences: CLOS dispatch (before
caches settle down) can involve compiling code. Most of the time BCL
is a tiny annoyance, but sometimes it can be a real headache. Sometimes it is an insurmountable barrier. )

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>My name is Adam Bond. I have been using computers for over 35 years, and during that time I have come across many programs which were difficult to use because of their interfaces. I decided to see if I could create something better.</p>
<p>
I invented Easy Function Keys to create an interface which would be much easier to learn for inexperienced computer users, but also much quicker to use for experienced users. It enables virtually all people to use their computer:</p>
<p>Disabled users no longer have to deal with multiple simultaneous key keyboard shortcuts, because in Easy Function Keys, you only press one key at a time.<br/> Stroke victims who only have the use of one arm can still use my interface.<br/> Disabled users who can't use a keyboard can still use it, because it works just as well with a mouse, touchscreen, eyetracking device, or any other pointing device, as with a keyboard.<br/>
Blind users can use my interface because it can be used with keyboard only, and a text to speech engine.<br/>
Laptop users can access commands more quickly with keyboard function keys, than with a trackpad (or mouse).
</p>
<p>There is no need to implement a different, or altered, interface, to accommodate all users, with Easy Function Keys.</p>

<p>Fly.js is a Javascript library. Simply, it’s a set of features destined to make the developing on applications easier which could be complex sometimes. To quote only theses, “Prototype” and “jQuery” are two of the most used library today.<br/><br/>Fly.js is a lightweight library. Its code is simple, within the reach of anyone, commented and structured. It’s cut in different modules : you take only what you need. Nothing superfluous. Each module is not required : when you download Fly.js, you just check those that will be useful, and let those you won’t need for your application.<br/><br/>What’s more, Fly.js is brought under GNU/GPL3 license. This license, known as “libre”, allows you to use Fly.js in all your project, to hack it, to redistribute it - under the only condition you keep this same license.</p>
<h2>Why another library ?</h2>
<p>This library was created for many reasons. First of all, the code quality of other libraries. By dint of getting always a more optimized code to decrease the file size and boost performance, the other libraries have tented to skimp on this point. I have wanted to know how worked some of their included features, and that took a long time. Everybody, especially if you're new in javascript programming, couldn't understand and use them<br/><br/>jQuery has recently launched a new version which don’t support Internet Explorer 6 anymore. Indeed, every navigator, through their updates, add some new fresh features, and by the way they don’t support others. Moreover, all the Javascript engines don’t do the same thing, with the same code.<br/>Mootools extends natives objects, which is not appreciated by the whole Javascript developers community.<br/>That’s why i wanted to create my own library, lightweight and easy to understand, and intended to be compatible with all browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, etc.).</p>
<h2><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.9108478613197803""><span>Who is concerned ?</span></strong></h2>
<p>For everybody ! For developers who want to progress in Javascript programming watching how do work some resources, for developers who need this library to their websites, and for the curious people who just want to test it. This libraries can also be used by the programmers who have no particular knowledge about Javascript but who want to develop in a easier way a website.</p>
<div>
<h2>In concrete terms, which are the advantages ? How could it effect my way of coding ?</h2>
<p>Obviously, there is a huge amount of available fonctions, of animations. Your code will be more concised and more explanatory : minimum of “magic” arguments (where the setting’s meaning is variable), a separation among the differents modules : getElementById foreshortening selector is $, and the quick way for CSS3 selector engine is $$ - Effects are seperated from DOM module (noticely for hide and show).<br/><br/>Fly.js remains a full librarie, lightweight and fun to use : chaining (avoidable), number of fonctions to improve developing...<br/>And, of course, a browser support (Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome, and Internet Explorer since the version 6).</p>
<h2>Exemples</h2>
<p>Here are some examples to show you how simple Flyjs is. This is an slider. It takes less than 15 lines of Javascript code. Isn't that awesome ?

<h2>Where the project is standing ?</h2>
<p>The project is much more in an advanced stage than an idea : a version more or less steady is upkeeping.

<h2 dir=""ltr"">Why should i be involved in such a project ?</h2>
<p>As you can notice, this project comprises almost 3000 code lines (excepted tiers libraries) and more of 100 functions. That is to say that the project makes progress. However, until nowadays, I focus on the developing part and not on the visibility (unless some posts on forums of developers) among people who is likely able to use it. The work is to write a very long documentation for each functions, thus its hosting and the code - in all its versions. As a result, i have to pay this hosting - which is not enable with my student spending limit.<br/><br/>I’m aware that my project can’t be compared with a report or with arts funding.

</div>
<div>
<h2>Other ways to help</h2>
<p>Of course, all of your comments are a precious help; even more if you are a developer : Fly.js is open-source. You can grab the code (in the actual version) and to take a look from top to bottom, test it, and if you want, use it for your next project. My benefit is to get back your impressions, comments and critics to balance my creator and developer point of view - which is everything but subjective. It allows me to offer you a more advanced and complete content in order to answer your expectations, as the whole users’ one. And obviously, you could talk about it to your friends.</p>

<span class=""notranlsate""></span>Hello, My name is Dr. <a href=""http://il.linkedin.com/in/elitalmor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eli Talmor</a>, I am co-founder and CEO of SentryCom.  After years of Research, Development, Testing and Market Validation - we are about to launch Sentrycs - our Software-as-a-Service. Sentrycs is an innovative Security Service for the masses! And as such- it is crucial that our early adopters will help us to spread the word… 
<p>Can we trust the Internet? Are we sure about the Identity of the people we are encountering on the Web? Are we sure that nobody is peeking into our secrets -confidential files we share with others? Are we sure that our credit-card transactions and third-party money transfers are safe? Of course – many people ask the same question – but we honestly believe that we’ve got the right answer: secure, inexpensive and easy to use. </p>
<p>Don't bet that bad guys are not after you... Better - think  what will happen to your Identity, your secrets and your reputation if they are...</p>
<p>With your contribution and your involvement – we hope to cross the chasm...This will allow us to scale up our Production Platform to serve more people. Thank you !</p>
<h1>Sentrycs for everybody</h1>
<p>Sentrycs is for ordinary folks who use their PCs and carry mobile phones. Almost daily they are prompted to prove their Identity online , either for social networking or opening business accounts. Almost daily they share something private with others  - document , picture , etc. Almost daily they do some sort of business  transactions that is potentially vulnerable to fraud. If you one of these folks - Sentrycs is designed for you.<br/></p>

Hello, My name is Dr. Eli Talmor, I am co-founder and CEO of SentryCom.  After years of Research, Development, Testing and Market Validation - we are about to launch Sentrycs - our Software-as-a-Service. Sentrycs is an innovative Security Service for the masses! And as such- it is crucial that our early adopters will help us to spread the word… 
Can we trust the Internet? Are we sure about the Identity of the people we are encountering on the Web? Are we sure that nobody is peeking into our secrets -confidential files we share with others? Are we sure that our credit-card transactions and third-party money transfers are safe? Of course – many people ask the same question – but we honestly believe that we’ve got the right answer: secure, inexpensive and easy to use. 
Don't bet that bad guys are not after you... Better - think  what will happen to your Identity, your secrets and your reputation if they are...
With your contribution and your involvement – we hope to cross the chasm...This will allow us to scale up our Production Platform to serve more people. Thank you !
Sentrycs for everybody
Sentrycs is for ordinary folks who use their PCs and carry mobile phones. Almost daily they are prompted to prove their Identity online , either for social networking or opening business accounts. Almost daily they share something private with others  - document , picture , etc. Almost daily they do some sort of business  transactions that is potentially vulnerable to fraud. If you one of these folks - Sentrycs is designed for you.

Electro Magnetic Fields (EMFs) may be one of the most pervasive ‘sleeping
giants’ of the 21st century. Unfortunately, we face a ‘Wild West’ situation
when it comes to wireless technology testing and standards. </p>
<p>Testing, which
was designed by the telecom industry, is grossly inadequate in proving the
safety of wireless technologies. Research shows that just exposing human cells
to these harmful radio frequencies (EMFs) causes an immediate biological
reaction.</p>
<p>There are more than six billion cell phones currently in use globally and that number continues to
grow each month....a technology that has only been in heavy use for the last
fifteen to twenty years.</p>
<p>Wireless
technologies are an everyday part of our lives: besides cell phones,
Bluetooth®, Wi-Fi, Wi-Max and cordless home/office phones are as ingrained in
our lifestyle today as is using a fork and a spoon. </p>
<p>We take for
granted that these technologies are adequately tested and safe. </p>
<p>But the truth is
that these wireless technologies (that produce harmful EMFs-non-ionizing
radiation) are not required to be tested for long term safety, and there are no
global, nor North American testing standards for any of these products that
adequately address the real risks! Additionally, the current testing protocol
does not differentiate between testing a child and an adult. Radiation goes
into the skull of a child three times deeper than an adult!</p>
<p>Wireless
technological science is the same worldwide, yet government standards for
allowable safe exposure differ widely from country to country. There is no
consensus on what constitutes safe, allowable exposure. </p>
<p>This alone
should cause pause for concern and catapult the world into adopting testing
protocol and allowable levels in devices immediately. </p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p>

<p></p></div>","The dangers of
Electro Magnetic Fields (EMFs) may be one of the most pervasive ‘sleeping
giants’ of the 21st century. Unfortunately, we face a ‘Wild West’ situation
when it comes to wireless technology testing and standards. 
Testing, which
was designed by the telecom industry, is grossly inadequate in proving the
safety of wireless technologies. Research shows that just exposing human cells
to these harmful radio frequencies (EMFs) causes an immediate biological
reaction.
There are more than six billion cell phones currently in use globally and that number continues to
grow each month....a technology that has only been in heavy use for the last
fifteen to twenty years.
Wireless
technologies are an everyday part of our lives: besides cell phones,
Bluetooth®, Wi-Fi, Wi-Max and cordless home/office phones are as ingrained in
our lifestyle today as is using a fork and a spoon. 
We take for
granted that these technologies are adequately tested and safe. 
But the truth is
that these wireless technologies (that produce harmful EMFs-non-ionizing
radiation) are not required to be tested for long term safety, and there are no
global, nor North American testing standards for any of these products that
adequately address the real risks! Additionally, the current testing protocol
does not differentiate between testing a child and an adult. Radiation goes
into the skull of a child three times deeper than an adult!
Wireless
technological science is the same worldwide, yet government standards for
allowable safe exposure differ widely from country to country. There is no
consensus on what constitutes safe, allowable exposure. 
This alone
should cause pause for concern and catapult the world into adopting testing
protocol and allowable levels in devices immediately.

Cell phone
technology has not been tested to determine the effects of long term
exposure- not only on human beings, but on the biodiversity of our planet.Trailer courtesy of James Russell's documentary ""Resonance Beings of Frequency""The Silvershield
project is about bringing wide spread awareness of the EMF issue as it relates
to wireless technology, and providing patented products featuring SILVER. It's
not about abandoning your smart phone, or wireless devices. 
                  Data used in the simulation courtesy of Cetecom USAThis brief simulation shows how radio frequency
radiation (EMF) spreads around a user’s head while using a cell phone. (This
simulation used data derived from actual testing and the lighter the color, the
higher the level of radiation.) Shockingly, in newer phones the signal is much
stronger; North America is allowed to have some of the strongest exposure levels
in the entire world when compared to other countries.Up until
recently it had been thought that the radiation produced by wireless
technologies, specifically cell phones and their assorted accessories, cause
absolutely no threat to human health.

For
instance, the test designed by the telecom industry has been shown to be
grossly inadequate in proving the safety of wireless technologies. Contrary to the standards used in Safety Code
6, determining if the flesh is heated or not does NOT determine safety.

independent, non-telecom industry funded testing shows that exposure can result
in single and double strand DNA breaks. While single strand DNA breaks are
repairable, double strand DNA breaks are usually a precursor for cancer. We now
know that just exposing human cells to these radio frequencies causes an
immediate biological reaction in the cells at the mitochondrial level.This remarkable
report aired on the Canadian Broadcast Corporation’s, The National.

 What are we fundraising?Robots, we all love robots. We want to help you start making budget Raspberry Pi robots using our kits for only £28.A fully assembled kit + Raspberry Pi Model B (Not Included) + Power Bank (Not Included)£28 Budget Robotics KitsWe are planning to make a £28 robotics kit for use with the Raspberry Pi, this includes:
One RTK-000-001 RPi Motor Controller Board Kit - This is our board we have designed to be able to drive motors using a Raspberry Pi
One Robot Kit - This is a laser cut out robot chassis including motors, wheels and screws. 
Wi-Fi Adapter - One USB Wi-Fi Adapter tested for the Raspberry Pi
Battery Box for the Robot - A 4xAA Battery holder that is used to power the motors.
Wires - 2 X 2 Wire cables, used to connect the motors to the RPi M.C.B
Documentation & Code - A set of online documentation and code that will guide you through making robots with the kit.
What you receive, electronics kit pre assembled only in the soldered version.You require:
Raspberry Pi Model A or B - The software works on both.
An SD Card - A SD card that you can install Raspbian or our own SD Image on.
Power source for your Pi - You will need to use your own power source for the Raspberry Pi
The idea of this is to promote the use of Raspberry pi in schools in a fun and enjoyable way while still learning and teaching programming.Why?I love robots, the first project I made with my Raspberry Pi was a robot but required lots of soldering, hacking and wires to make it work and cost me a lot of money to make. Now using the budget RTK-000-001 Motor controller board all that is required is now a budget robot to go along with it.Robots are one of the great things that everyone loves even if they are not fully interested in Raspberry Pi. They help teach the basic fundamentals of programming and can be extended by adding sensors on top or coding in extra functions or new software. Documentation & CodeOne of the things that we are doing is creating unique documentation and code samples to use with your budget 'bots. Documentation - 

Assembly guide - How to assemble the robot chassis, where best to position the Pi and wiring instructions.

Plug and Play guide -  How to setup and configure the Plug and Play robot software, to start controlling it straight away.

Python Guide - a step by step guide to programming your robot in python to make it move .
Spacebrew Guide Part 1* - Python, a step by step guide to then taking the python code and adding in Spacebrew on the python side.

Spacebrew Guide Part 2* - Javascript, a step by step guide on then creating a basic robot controller in Javascript and then communicate to the robot using Spacebrew.

Scratch GPIO Guide - A lesson on moving the robot around using scratch and input from the keyboard. Also includes setting up a VNC server on your Raspberry Pi to be able to use Scratch.

Adding sound  - Robots are even more awesome when they make noises. This guide will show you how to add sound with a pair of off the shelf budget speakers. 

* The out come of these two guides will be the same as the Plug and Play guide, this is from where we use these software and code for the core of the Plug and Play software.Do you have an idea for any documentation? Contact us @ Indiegogo@ryanteck.ltd.ukCode - 

Plug and Play Robot Code - The python and HTML5 & JS code will be provided as plug and play robot code. All that is required is to put the python onto a Raspberry Pi, Configure Wi-Fi and then launch the client on the Javascript Side.

Plug and Play SD card image - this is a downloadable SD card image for the Raspberry Pi where all is required is your Wi-Fi details. After just connect to the client and configure spacebrew.

Scratch Example - A downloadable scratch project that can be used to show off what the robot will do after the end of the tutorial.
