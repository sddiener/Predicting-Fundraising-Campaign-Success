Over the years, it gradually became a point of excellence for leather production in Italy, collaborating with some of the most prestigious Italian and foreign fashion brands. We're his smallest client by a huge margin, but not the least loved!
 

It took us multiple trials and errors before we settled with the current production. We weren't just looking for reliability, but also great quality and attention to details. Located in the capital of Renaissance, Florence, Italy, our handbag Factory has been hand-crafting bags with time-honoured techniques for over 40 years.

We work with a pattern maker who is an expert in making patterns with a good fit. She has worked for companies like ZARA, MANGO and other feminine fashion brands. With her expertise we have a beautiful fit for you in standard sizes.ORGANIC COTTONWe love ecological fabrics! Why? Because it’s healthy for you, the environment and the farmers.For the two-in-one pencilskirts we only work with organic cotton with a GOTS certification.This means you are sure you have real organic cotton and that the fabrics are dyed with low impact dyes.We have two kinds of fabrics derived from woodpulp, the linen kind and the silk kind. Because of the fruit pomegranate the fabric is available in Majith Red and Anar Green (raw pomegranate). This traditional dyeing method is in possession of the GOTS certificate.WOODPULP SILK BLOUSEWOODPULP LINEN BLOUSEThe woodpulp linen blouse is currently in the sketch  fase. The fabric is a little bit thicker than the silk fabric and has a subtle glance. The blouse has natural shell buttons in the color pearl. Also available in both colors: Anar Green and Majith Red. Our production facility is based in Eastern-Europe and is compliant with the EU and international labor standards.Thank you SO much for YOUR support! With each item we realise a more eco and social friendly fashion world. We can do this together!What is organic cotton?With Organic cotton the cottonfarmers don't use any chemicals and pesticides. So you won't have any harmful chemicals in your clothes. Healthy for your skin and healthy for the cottonfarmers.The certification criteria are in line with GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standards). Which is recognised all over the world by all certifying bodies and cultivation associations that work with a textile certification programme.""The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) was developed through collaboration by leading standard setters with the aim of defining requirements that are recognised world-wide and that ensure the organic status of textiles from harvesting of the raw materials through environmentally and socially responsible manufacturing all the way to labelling in order to provide credible assurance to the consumer.""WOODPULP FABRICWoodsilk is made of Bemberg cupro fiber to finish from Japan. It has a subtle luster, drapes beautifully and is extremely breathable. Clean the blouse at a non-toxic dry cleaner or hang the blouse in the fresh air. Herbal dying is one of the core businesses of our supplier in India (Herbal Fab).What is the difference between the woodpulp linen and silk? The linen fabric has a more subtile glance. The woodsilk exactly looks like conventional silk but is eco-friendly. Both of the fabrics are very suitable for spring and summer because of the light fabric.Where does the fabrics come from? The organic cotton is woven, dyed and printed in India and distributed from Germany. This organic cotton has a GOTS certificate. The woodpulp fabrics come from India and are traditionally dyed with the pomegranate fruit in India. For this herbal dye method our supplier has the GOTS certificate.What about the costs for shipping abroad?The shipping costs are for free within the Netherlands. For other destinations we have to charge transportation costs. Other EU countries EUR 5 and EUR 10 for countries outside the EU.What is the delivery term?Within 2 months after the ending of the campaign.What if the skirt doesn't fit? We understand that choosing the right size can be difficult and we will do our best to exchange every pencilskirt or blouse that you send back to us for another size. Because our margins are really tight we will have to charge you for the extra shipping costs. We don't refund for this crowdfunding campaign.Durable fashion tipsSee our blog: http://www.store-shekila.com/blog-durable-fashion-tips/blog-durable-fashion-tips/Please get in touch with us.

<h1><strong>The Story of Plex™ - Wallet?</strong></h1>
<p>My wife and I created the Plex™ - Wallet for people on the ""Go""!</p>
<p>We wanted to offer an honest design that would challenge the traditional ideas of what a wallet can be... that is able to carry all types of great stuff... while easily fitting in your pocket, purse, in a compartment or other place.</p>
<p>Plex™ is great as a primary wallet, for specific occassions or for storing all those extra cards in one place (grocery discount cards, incentive cards and such).</p>
<p>The Plex™ - Wallet aims for greater versatility, transportability and function.  It's very durable, easy-to-use and a cinch to clean!</p>

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>After working in the retail sunglass industry, we here at Calero Sunglasses decided to make some changes.</p>
<p>Quality Sunglasses: Expensive, Stylish, long lasting, quality materials, made in Italy or U.S.A.</p>
<p>Cheap Sunglasses: Lacking build quality, fall apart, saves $$$, made in China</p>
<p>After analyzing the gap between these two catagories, we decided to take the best from both worlds. It is also very important to us to support the local economy and so each Gator will be made right here in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p><strong>The Gator:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frames</strong> manufactured by heat injection molding of TR90 Grilamid Nylon, a durable material that provides comfort and the perfect flex pattern to sit on your head without squeezing your brains out! Made in U.S.A. </p>
<p>Just an example of the flex possible with TR90 Grilamid frames, that's a 90 degree bend without snapping!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/OqzUKd8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Polarized Lenses: </strong> The Gator's lenses are made from impact and scratch resistant polycarbonate that offers durability and style. The polarized lenses take out glare which restores image quality and protects your eyes! They block 100% of UVA, UVB, and UVC rays.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/dduP7zT.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>SnapLock Hinges</strong> have been designed to snap out under pressure instead of breaking.

Quality Sunglasses: Expensive, Stylish, long lasting, quality materials, made in Italy or U.S.A.
Cheap Sunglasses: Lacking build quality, fall apart, saves $$$, made in China
After analyzing the gap between these two catagories, we decided to take the best from both worlds. It is also very important to us to support the local economy and so each Gator will be made right here in Salt Lake City, Utah.
The Gator:

Polarized Lenses:  The Gator's lenses are made from impact and scratch resistant polycarbonate that offers durability and style. The polarized lenses take out glare which restores image quality and protects your eyes! They block 100% of UVA, UVB, and UVC rays.

I started Noir Rose Lingerie as I have been passionate for lingerie since I was 17, and I have been sewing  at home  since I was 6. The older I have gotten, the more I struggled to find a bra that fits me in the shops and something that is attractive to wear. Plus, with my own personal extensive collection, I’ve gotten to the point where I am now designing new pieces that I would not find in the shops.</p><p>Having discussed this with my social media followers (who I have gained through my bridal hair, make up and henna work) and clients, I realised there is a big market for bespoke as a lot of women would love to purchase something that they can have a creative input in and fits perfectly. BUT they want to see real female bodies advertising the range. </p><p>My aim is to create and build on a brand that is affordable luxury, ethically produced, good values that are based on traditional couture designs, that is advertised on real bodies that show cellulite, stretch marks and changes of the female form.  Most companies use airbrushed images but I want to show my range on real bodies to empower the everyday-woman-on-the-go looking at this. </p><h2><strong>Why bespoke, made to measure? </strong></h2><p>From recent studies, 87% of women are currently wearing the wrong size bra, and majority of those women do not get measured on a regular basis, as most high street shops do not offer bra fittings. A lot of these shops offer a standard range of sizes and do not cater for curvaceous or those who have petite backs and a large bust.</p><p>Noir Rose Lingerie is aimed at women who are busy, who want something comfortable to wear and aesthetically pleasing. Whether you are a young mum or a fashionable mature women, I cater for everyone with boobs and those who have undergone a mastectomy. The aim is to ensure women are wearing a product that doesn’t restrict their movement and daily activities.</p><p>By offering bespoke bras, we can eliminate these long-term health issues that ill-fitting bras are causing.</p><p>Bra fitting is a technical process using mathematical formulas. A shop sizing guides indicates you should measure under bust and full bust and then refer to the guide. For made to measure, at least 15 measurements are taken to ensure the bra and bottoms fit well.</p><p>Besides the personal interest in bespoke, commercially, it is more cost efficient way of doing business. We are only making garments that are paid for, we offer 1 free alteration. We are not producing or holding stock based on standard sizing that may result into having the price reduced in order to get rid of it. We are not wasting materials on unwanted products either. Therefore, I do not have the same overheads as a store or a large company that needs a warehouse.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580659113/a9vuyrmuxevjjan974oc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2><strong>Helping the World </strong></h2><p>I want Noir Rose Lingerie to be environment friendly and to be able to help others.</p><p>The fashion industry is known to produce a lot of material waste. In order to avoid this, I have been purchasing and will continue to do, a limited amount of fabrics. For the swimwear range, I have been using Econyl, which is a material made from plastics found in the sea. Even the packaging is going to be recyclable.</p><p>In regards to helping others, proceeds from the “Stacey” set will always go to Rape Crisis charity to help those who have been abused. Whilst most lingerie companies support breast related charities, I will be supporting those helping rape victims. It takes a lot of confidence and courage to wear lingerie that is deemed sexy. If I can help someone and help them gain their confidence back, it would mean a lot.</p><p>As I am producing the lingerie in the UK, I want to maintain British manufacturing standards, and be able to train the next generation in lingerie making and design skills, which have declined dramatically in the last 60 years. I also aim to open up summer pop up shops with lingerie ranges on show and ready made swimwear for instant sale; ideally at train stations if possible or in popular work areas around London and Birmingham. If this works well then I will consider opening a shop in those areas, creating jobs for locals.</p><p>If we expand globally, I will strongly consider opening local operational bases where there is demand. Within this in mind, the future possibilities are endless.</p><p>Also as the packaging, stickers, hang labels and garment care labels are all produced in the UK, I am ensuring our carbon footprint is low as possible.</p><h2><strong>Zero Waste Fabric </strong></h2><p>When producing any garment, there is always excess material that tends to go to waste. My aim is to have zero waste by using cut offs for stuffing for other products and donating it to those who need stuffing for children toys.</p><h2><strong>How you can help? </strong></h2><p>To kick start this venture, I set up an Etsy shop however, in order to reach more people, I aim to reach more women and clients by showcasing the lingerie range and what is on offer by attending wedding exhibitions, swimwear exhibitions and shows such as Paris Interfiliere and Miami Swimwear week.</p><p>To prepare for this, the samples for next collection need to be made, this involves designing, pattern making, sourcing new fabrics and making the garments. Then the garments need to be photographed, showcased on social media, our website and look books for the exhibitions to promote to the media and public.</p><p>As you can see we have so much to do and we really need your help. Your donations will be used for the following:</p><p>£3000 Exhibition Fees (Weddings UK / Paris / Miami)</p><p>£1000 Fabrics and hardware for garments for next range</p><p>£500 Showcase materials and crowdfunding fees</p><p>£400 Printed Advertising Materials – Media supplies, Press &amp; Sales Kits</p><p>£1200 Photoshoot for the new range</p><p>£1000 Website update</p><p>I am so excited to share this project with the crowdfunding community! I cannot wait to move forward with our brand and show you all the results!</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Why invest me? As well as the brand and idea itself? </strong></h2><p>If I manage to exceed my target expectations, then I will be able to</p><ul>
<li>hire to some freelancers on a part time basis</li>
<li>increase my marketing and PR</li>
<li>purchasing industrial sewing machines for longer and maximum use</li>
<li>to be able to exhibit at more shows</li>
</ul><h2><strong>Risks and challenges </strong></h2><p>The challenges I am currently facing are lack of funding and timing. I was recently made redundant and with Brexit, work has been slow and therefore my self-funding slowed down too.  The second challenge is time. As we are approaching wedding season and mid-year industry exhibitions, I need to ensure the range is ready to showcase. I am currently temping full time and working on this in my spare time.</p><p>I have invested not only my own money but countless days and nights to craft the current range and work on all the admin side of this business too.</p><p>I have planned out everything to ensure that all goals and targets are met, as I am highly motived and driven to succeed. I have been a PA and EA for 13 years, therefore I feel like my skills and experience will also help here.</p><p>I am adamant on keeping costs down and sourcing people and materials in the UK and Europe, when needed. This allows me to monitor quality, time and ensure there is less delays.</p><p>Fortunately, I am lucky to have a team of people who have a variety of skills and work experience that can help me.</p><p>If I am unable to secure funding, then I will not be able to attend these exhibitions this year, production will be delayed to when I can afford to do this all and I will not be able to hire other freelancers to assist in the various stages of making this all happen. I know this may be too much information but I want to be open and honest with my funders as I value your kind support.</p><p>Even if you are unable to help, I would be grateful if you could share this with your friends family and anyone you know, even on social media.  </p><p>If you have any questions about the campaign or my brand, I will be happy to answer them, please email or leave comments and I will get back to you as soon as possible.</p><h2><strong>Why invest me?

<p>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>-Marketing/PR/Sales agencies:</b></p><p><b>
</b></p><p>
</p>
At
this point our startup needs  the best fashion marketing and sales experts. Right now this is one of the most important things we need money
for! <br/>As
we are designers and not sales geniuses we need to stay focused as
much as possible on our creations and  of course the production, so we 
would like to give the best marketing professionals a free hand in doing 
their job.<p>
</p><p>
Therefore
we have contacted over 150 fashion agencies worldwide. We have had
many Skype interviews with professionals from Tokyo to New York and
the results are superb - we are negotiating now with agencies who have
10-30 years of experience in building up small brands like ours. With
the money raised with your help here on Indiegogo we could get a contract with one of these
big names in the fashion industry so our products could find the
right way to be sold worldwide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>-THE Product: </b><br/></p><p>We are full of plans of new prototypes. That's the 2nd most important thing we need money for right now! </p><p>
</p><p>
'To
keep growing our brand' means for
us to keep searching for the best sources and inspirations.<br/></p>
<p>Our vision is to make excellent quality, eternal fashion, using all the raw materials with  full consciousness and respect. Putting together the best 'puzzle-pieces' and unite them into sophisticated products you will love to wear for many seasons.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459010768/hmgbucxmlzfovze1dp2i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>-and of course the

entrepreneurial friends full of enthusiasm for making  our vision a reality:To keep growing our cool brand Back to the FOX





-Marketing/PR/Sales agencies:


At
this point our startup needs  the best fashion marketing and sales experts. Right now this is one of the most important things we need money
for! As
we are designers and not sales geniuses we need to stay focused as
much as possible on our creations and  of course the production, so we 
would like to give the best marketing professionals a free hand in doing 
their job.

Therefore
we have contacted over 150 fashion agencies worldwide. We have had
many Skype interviews with professionals from Tokyo to New York and
the results are superb - we are negotiating now with agencies who have
10-30 years of experience in building up small brands like ours. With
the money raised with your help here on Indiegogo we could get a contract with one of these
big names in the fashion industry so our products could find the
right way to be sold worldwide.


-THE Product: We are full of plans of new prototypes. That's the 2nd most important thing we need money for right now! 

'To
keep growing our brand' means for
us to keep searching for the best sources and inspirations.
Our vision is to make excellent quality, eternal fashion, using all the raw materials with  full consciousness and respect. Putting together the best 'puzzle-pieces' and unite them into sophisticated products you will love to wear for many seasons.-and of course the
FOXes :) FOXes are our labour of love.From every purchase we donate
$5 for WWF-Canada's 'Rescue the arctic FOXes' program to help this beautiful,
clever and mystical creature staying happy in the global warming times like ours! 













Beside
the refined design we also
did our homework on how to start mass production. 
 We
have identified and locked on the best 
people around with 30-40 years of experience in the field of production. These are 
local specialists, who have a great passion for their profession. We have made successful test runs with them, so we are eager to keep these great people busy.The fabrics we use are from local warehouses, easy to access in big amounts, so a quick production time is guaranteed. Slight variances in the color tones might be possible but we'll inform you in that case before the production.After the Indiegogo campaign has finished we are ready to ship your jacket within 4-6 weeks!(we are trying to make the production time even shorter, so there is a chance you get the jacket earlier then promised :))
What
happens after you contribute? We will collect your order information: size, color,wrist message, shipping details. After our Indiegogo campaign is finished, we start production right away. As soon as your jacket is ready, we'll ship it to you.

If you follow the sizing chart carefully, then the
jackets shall fit you just fine. Still, if you wish to exchange your
jacket for any reason, we will allow you to do that, but you’ll
have to pay for the two way shipping. As we are just starting up and
offering our jackets at highly discounted prices on Indiegogo, we
won’t be able to accept returns",57.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h2>About:</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Karri. I am just a normal person with a goal to help my community and eventually many other communities in keeping creativity and charity alive. By creating heART Designs, I am hoping to support many different causes and still bring unique designs to the world. My artist will be creating a variety of designs that will pertain to each cause that they support. Our main design, the heART will go to supporting art programs and events, including skill building workshops for school aged kids to attend. With schools cutting back on art programs and access to studio hours after school, I want to bring that opportunity back into the community. Creativity can help a kid in more ways than we could ever imagine. Having access to studio hours outside of class and being able to go to workshops and classes through my art teacher, I was able to get through a lot of difficult times and able to express my emotions in a very productive manner. I just want every kid to have that opportunity to work through their emotions and express themselves. Other causes will include causes that are also dear to me, yet supported and dear to the community as well. We will have a hive themed heART that a percentage of sales will be donated to saving the bees. There will be a paw print design that will support local shelters and rescues, with the hopes of supporting in a wider capacity. Other causes will be added over time with demand and design ideas. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To begin we need funding for the machines (screen printing, embroidery) that will help us print or embroider the designs on products. We will also need said products, such as: t-shirts, sweatshirts, bags, hats, stickers, and more. Funds will also go to supporting shipping operations and marketing for the brand. For all of this we are asking for $5,000. This will assure that we can produce quality products for consumers to purchase, and raise sizable amounts for each cause. </p>
<p>If you support our cause, you will have priority ordering, meaning we will produce any product you order before the general public, you will also receive a free product based on the size of your contribution. </p>
<p>If full funds are not raised, I will use what I can to start producing as best I can, the funds will not be used for anything outside of this project. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our challenges are going to stem from how small our operation is. Production times might take longer than expected just because we do not have a lot of man power. Another challenge will be the time it will take to build up the brand and sell the products, it is never guaranteed that it will take off right away. </p>
<p>Risks are that people may not purchase much or the project will fail, but in order to be successful that is a risk we have to take. I hope you see the potential in this project like I do.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute monitarily, we could still use your help spreading the word! Share us on social media, share us with friends you believe would be interested in supporting us. Just help us reach more people. :)</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time and support!</p>

</div></div>","What is AMOLEP?
AMOLEP is combination clothing.
AMOLEP-KTRX

AND AMOLEP-IKI






Material

AMOLEP-KTRX: 100% Trevira/Micro Polyester, manufactured in Germany

AMOLEP-IKI: 100% Cotton, manufactured in GermanyOur StoryWe are living in a world of mixed cultures and communities. People feel attached to more than one country.  Either they have mixed backgrounds, were born and raised in different countries, have visited another country and feel really attached  to it, or are just simply great fans of other countries. And AMOLEP embodies this mindset.  

AMOLEP-KTRX is really straight forward; one side of the jersey represents one country and the other side represents another country. You select and design your own jersey. 
These are the Jerseys that can be used for the combinations (Check out our Gallery for a closer look at all the available Jerseys)


Why do we need €20,000 (or more!)?
We intend to have the Kombitrix manufactured in Germany where top Quality is guaranteed because quality and the feel of our products are very important for us. Top quality has its price though and the €20,000 will mostly be used to manufacture the KTRX and Ikis.  

Over 80% of the earnings will be used for manufacturing and packaging.
15% of the earnings will be used to cover unforeseen costs.

The remaining 5% of the earnings and any extra money earned will be used to help fund our planned AMOLEP Beach Soccer Tournament in the summer of 2015. We also hope to use the extra money to fix up and run our website www.amolep.com








Please use our size table at the bottom to determine your KTRX and IKI size for your order.
International shipping is paid separately. Please take a look at our shipping costs table below for more details.

You can find out more about our straps from our Hidden Time campaign. The smart docking system allows for easy strap swaps.   Each TTT edition comes in unique packaging designed especially for the collaboration.The watch also comes with a limited edition collector's plaque.Packaging design for Order and Hidden Time. About The Trio of Time The Series 000, Series K452, Hidden Time, and Order watches from Anicorn. Through The Trio of Time, we have the privilege of collaborating with local designers from incredible cities around the world. Together, we create a unique timepiece and bring our story to Kickstarter, where backers then help us bring the project to life, and choose our next destination. The watch and strap combinations between Hidden Time and Order are endless.  In 2017, we began in Seoul with Korean designer Jiwoong Jung, who designed the first timepiece of the series, Hidden Time. The campaign was successfully funded within 48 hours from more than 2,000 backers worldwide.Order expands our vision to challenge the perceptions of time. The first edition of the Trio of Time, Hidden Time.  We're really excited to be launching this second edition in New York City—the destination our backers chose from the first TTT campaign. If Order is a success, you will help us choose our next stop on this journey!   Why Indiegogo? Kickstarter has allowed us to not only bring our timepieces to life, but also establish our business. Most importantly, it has gifted us with a strong community that supports the work we do. We are deeply humbled by your support, and we can't wait to keep bringing you exciting projects. Order's watchface is just the right size for wrists small and large. Your support will help us make Order a reality. After successful funding, you'll help us decide on our next city to visit. Anicorn's The Trio of Time will then collaborate with a new designer, in a new city, to tell a new story. Join us on our journey to complete The Trio of Time. Risks and challengesWe know there are always risks with production, but with our extensive experience we are confident we can get our watches out to you on time. We’ve learned about manufacturing and fulfillment from our three previous campaigns, and if we face any issues, we will be completely transparent and keep everyone updated on our progress.As always, communication is key for us! We will share any and all developments during manufacturing and beyond.",40.0,6,"3 Campaigns

<p><b>How many emails do you receive every day</b>? More than 10?<br/>Or <b>are you tired of continuously checking your mobile phone / tablet / pc, for that email you are waiting for</b>? <br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Then you will appreciate our <i><b>E-mail Watch!</b></i></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We found that of the many emails we receive, </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">only a few require our immediate attention, some can just be read later and some are really non-urgent notifications.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>So it would be nice if we could have a quick idea of the incoming emails just by giving a glance</i> to something somewhere around you, without the need of turning on any other device, just to check if there's anything new. No screens to read, no screens to touch, just a quick glance, without loosing the attention to what you are doing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">So we created the </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">E-mail Watch</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, a <b>small </b>(ca. 50x40x20mm), <b>3d printed</b>, <b>microUSB </b>powered, beautifully <b>LED </b>illuminated, stand alone, <b>Wi-Fi</b> connected box!<br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It features a total of 4 multicolor LEDs, each giving an easy and quick information about your inbox new messages (and you can customize it to receive any other sort of notifications!).</span></p>
<h4><span><span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">project is open-source</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, all the </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">code will be shared</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> so you can

</div><div> <p>We already have a few working prototypes currently in use, you can see one in the picture above. We are already refining the case design and we would like to improve the software behind it and make it even simpler to configure; then, once up and running, its operation requires no knowledge or control at all!</p>
<p>Fundings are mainly aimed at finalizing the new design, and buying components in larger quantities to keep the final product price as low as possible.<br/><b>That's why if we don't reach the objective no one will be charged and, unfortunately, no one will receive the perk</b>. :-(<br/>So please help us spread the word and make this project a success! :-)</p>
<p>With the full perks (kit or assembled) you will receive a fully functioning and final product, complete with all the required instructions to set it up in minutes.<br/>The <i>Custom Color</i> perk gives you the exclusive right of choosing a beautifully colored case (red, green or yellow).</p>
<p>We currently support Gmail and use the <b>Gmail labels</b> to differentiate the various categories of messages. For example you could consider 5 different Gmail labels:<br/></p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><i>Bank</i>: Credit card/ATM (urgent) notices ...</span></li>

</ol>
<p></p>
<p>Each label corresponds to a different color of the main multicolor indicator (e.g. <b>blue</b> for Bank, <b>green</b> for Personals, <b>purple</b> for Social, <b>cyan</b> for Notifications).<br/>The <i>Specials </i>category is indicated by the separate star-shaped, <b>yellow</b> indicator.</p>
<p>Or you may choose to use the <i><b>category labels </b></i>provided by Gmail to automatically filter messages:</p>

<p>In addition, the top multicolor indicator becomes <b>red</b> to notify you of problems with your Gmail account (like network issues, wrong password or other errors) and becomes <b>yellow</b> in case no information is received for some time (temporary warning sign).</p>

</div></div>","In short
How many emails do you receive every day? More than 10?Or are you tired of continuously checking your mobile phone / tablet / pc, for that email you are waiting for? Then you will appreciate our E-mail Watch!
We found that of the many emails we receive, only a few require our immediate attention, some can just be read later and some are really non-urgent notifications.
So it would be nice if we could have a quick idea of the incoming emails just by giving a glance to something somewhere around you, without the need of turning on any other device, just to check if there's anything new. No screens to read, no screens to touch, just a quick glance, without loosing the attention to what you are doing.
So we created the E-mail Watch, a small (ca. 50x40x20mm), 3d printed, microUSB powered, beautifully LED illuminated, stand alone, Wi-Fi connected box!It features a total of 4 multicolor LEDs, each giving an easy and quick information about your inbox new messages (and you can customize it to receive any other sort of notifications!).
This project is open-source, all the code will be shared so you can
improve it or change its behavior to your needs and preferences!
 What We Need & What You Get
 We already have a few working prototypes currently in use, you can see one in the picture above. We are already refining the case design and we would like to improve the software behind it and make it even simpler to configure; then, once up and running, its operation requires no knowledge or control at all!
Fundings are mainly aimed at finalizing the new design, and buying components in larger quantities to keep the final product price as low as possible.That's why if we don't reach the objective no one will be charged and, unfortunately, no one will receive the perk. :-(So please help us spread the word and make this project a success! :-)
With the full perks (kit or assembled) you will receive a fully functioning and final product, complete with all the required instructions to set it up in minutes.The Custom Color perk gives you the exclusive right of choosing a beautifully colored case (red, green or yellow).
We currently support Gmail and use the Gmail labels to differentiate the various categories of messages. For example you could consider 5 different Gmail labels:

Bank: Credit card/ATM (urgent) notices ...
Personal: Friends/Family (still important) messages...
Social: Facebook/Twitter (could wait a minute)...
Notifications: Advertisement/Discounts (uhm, read 'em later)...
Specials: Your beloved/Important messages (""Starred"" messages) 


Each label corresponds to a different color of the main multicolor indicator (e.g. blue for Bank, green for Personals, purple for Social, cyan for Notifications).The Specials category is indicated by the separate star-shaped, yellow indicator.
Or you may choose to use the category labels provided by Gmail to automatically filter messages:


The ""Starred"" messages have a dedicated star-shaped indicator:


In addition, the top multicolor indicator becomes red to notify you of problems with your Gmail account (like network issues, wrong password or other errors) and becomes yellow in case no information is received for some time (temporary warning sign).

The embedded blue LED (right side of the box) indicates the successfull cloud connection and the correct activity.
The pulsing (hidden under the cloud symbol) multicolor LED meaning is described on the Spark starting page and mainly provides network connection information.




Technical details and requirements


To make all this work fine you have a few options:




Run a simple (Linux) shell script (provided by us) on an ""always on"" PC (or a network server) or for example a Raspberry Pi, to check emails and send appropriate commands to the E-mail Watch. Of course you could have a single PC doing the job (somewhere in the cloud) for multiple Gmail accounts and E-mail Watch devices (anywhere you have a WiFi internet access).


Create a free account on pythonanywhere.com and run our Bash script there, so you don't need to have your own server online... it's the cloud!


Use any online service like Zapier, IFTTT, or many others to create your own rules and activate the E-mail Watch notifications at your own preference (based on email, or any other available source).


Build your own web page (or simple browser bookmarks) where you manually set notifications for someone else anywhere on earth (where a Wi-Fi connection to the Internet is available!).


Here is an exemplary architecture of the system using a free account on pythonanywhere.com (case 2):





Since all the code is open source, you will be able to modify it if you would like to change any behavior. Also the hardware allows for some customizations (like changing LED colors or adding a light sensor, for example!).This project full technical details and preview code are also available on the following: Hackster page.


Risks & Challenges
 The prototypes have been up and running continuously for a few months so we are really confident of their stability and reliability. The case design is nearly definitive, we may need to make one or two finalizing steps for optimum results. Each case will be 3d printed in Europe. The assembly will be (home) made in Italy by hand for maximum quality (and some cost saving!).
The electronic part is based on the very well known and greatly supported Spark Core, which is a former very succesfully crowd-funded project.
We are also working on the software side to make it easier and compatible with any (IMAP) email server, rather than just your Gmail account. Also, we plan to improve the software to provide real time notifications (current update time is 45 seconds on average).
We will keep you up to date on this page, so you know what you can expect and which features and improvements we will be adding to this project. Also, your feedback will be very much appreciated!


Given the very low consumption of the E-mail Watch, you could use a USB battery (commonly used to recharge mobile phones) to power it for several hours (depending on the battery capacity, a work day duration is easily reachable).
Other Ways You Can Help
 You think you personally don't need the E-mail Watch or you prefer to invest your financial resources in other projects? No problem! Please just make sure you share this project page with your friends, collegues or anyone you think could be interested in knowing more about it. That's the crowd-sourcing, help us reach the crowds out there!

West Virginia as a state is bonded by two things..... Blue and Gold.   They are a not just a fan base...but a large family base who supports those that support them.I have learned quickly that my bride to be bleeds blue and gold and wanted her own pair of West Virginia kicks, so I thought.. why not make this offering to everyone who shares her passion.For those who are reading this.  Welcome.   I am excited to provide this offering as I did market research on if this would be feasible and the feedback was overwhelming.  The first go around these had over 600 shares on Facebook in less than 5 days and inquiries on WHEN WILL THEY BE AVAILABLE!?!?!? This pre-sale will last exactly 3 days.  Those who purchased initially will not have their footwear delayed due to other's being late to the party.To those who take this opportunity, I thank you in advance.
What We Need & What You GetThere are future perks for WVU depending on the level of success of this project.
I am raising $15,000 which represents $5,000 for each color-way

<p>When Apple first made the announcement of the upcoming wireless earphones in late 2016, it came as a pleasant surprise for all the avid apple product users, including our product team.</p>
<p>However, when we saw the actual AirPods on display during the showcase by Apple’s CEO Tim Cook, we couldn’t help but question ourselves.Could these Airpods really adapt to any and all situations?

<div><p>Every year, 10 billion plants are thrown away all over the world because of a lack of proper care. In fact, many of us don't have plants because we feel frustated by them. Others don't have the time or the space to enjoy them. </p></div>

<p>At Citysens we want to solve these issues with a unique garden:</p>
<p>- It’s made of bioplastic, from renewable biomass.</p>
<p>- You save up to 50% in water and mineral salts compared to traditional systems.</p>
<p>- Power consumption of less than 3€/year (thanks to its low-consumption water pump which is automatically turned on for 15 min per day)</p>
<p>- Transforms not only our spaces but also our cities: enjoy a greener environment and cleaner air.</p>
<div></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Technology at your service</b></h3>
<p>Did you know that plants feed on various mineral salts that they absorb from soil? In soil, bacteria and worms transform organic matter into these mineral salts. <span><b>Citysens works without soil</b>. In this way, we avoid dirt and achieve a lighter vertical structure. Using the technology of hydroponics, we are able to deliver the optimal mixture of mineral salts that each family of plant needs using our automatic irrigation system. </span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/965525/files/20141028064426-gota.jpg?1414503866"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Instead of soil we use rockwool and peach pits. Our peach pits are recycled from the juice industry and they helps roots find the water, nutrients and oxygen they need.</p>
<p>Hydroponics have several advantatges:</p>
<p>- Less dirt</p>
<p>- Lighter structure</p>
<p>- Plants require less space</p>
<p>- Water and nutrients can be reused</p>

<p>Citysens began more than 2 years ago when Xavi first constructed a hydroponic vertical garden with tomatoes. At this time he was finishing his doctoral thesis in nanosensors at the Universitat Rovira i Virgili in Tarragona (Spain). </p>
<p>After finishing the doctoral thesis, Xavi teamed up with Francisco Andrade and Par Blanking (members at the Innovation Hub of the Universitat Rovira i Virgili) and together started exploring the opportunities behind the relationship between people and nature in the city. We discovered that the main barriers preventing people from enjoying nature in cities are time, space and expertise...so we started Citysens in order to solve that! </p>

<div>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">We want to secure the maximum quality of such an awesome product. Although we have experience in the product design and manufacturing, these are some of the risks we are exposed to:</span><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Manufacturing</b>: creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this size is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. Creating the best molds for a product of this size is vital and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility we're working with tooling manufacturers partners with a track record for prompt quality.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Product adjustments</b>: as Citysens gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes will be made to test and refine the product. These will always be for the benefit of you, the best clients ever. We will let you know exactly how the process is advancing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Fulfilment</b>: sometimes things go ugly and can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could happen. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will locate and contact at least one back-up supplier for each part of the process.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>FAQs</h3>
<div>
<p><b>- What happens when plants grow too big? </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The plants we have chosen for the Citysens garden are medium size plants that do not grow very large. Remember, that because we use hydroponics, the plant’s roots will always have water and nutrients readily available and so do not grow as big as in soil (where they need to search for water and nutrients). If you ever want to change a plant, you can do it easily: take the plant out and carefully transplant it to a pot with soil. Be aware, you'll have to water it daily then! </p>
<p><b>- Does the Citysens garden need to be plugged?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Citysens garden includes a small pump coupled to
a timer that needs to be plugged to a power source. Our aim is that you can
avoid the constant watering of plants. Be aware the power consumption of the
pump is very low, less than 3 €/year! If this small power consumption allows
you to have more beautiful plants at home, we believe that spending on
electricity is well justified! Besides, there are now companies that offer
electricity from renewable sources, did you know? </p>
<p><b>- Do you use a pump? Is it noisy?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes, we use a pump to automatically water and feed plants every day. We selected our pump from 8 different options and made sure to select the quietest one, which makes practically no noise.</p>
<p><b>- Can I choose the plants for my Citysens garden?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes, once the campaign is over we will send a form to all our backers so they can choose their desired plant family. Backers will choose among four plant families: life red, pure green, placid blue and green aromas. Choice will be made according to personal tastes and taking into acount the light requirements of the plant family. We are working to offer new plant families soon. </p>
<p><b>- What colours are available for the Citysens garden?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the campaign is over we will send a form to all our backers so they can choose their desired colour for the structure. The Citysens garden is available in ivory white and dark brown to best suit the décor of your space. </p>
<p><b>- What are Citysens nutrients made of?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The nutrients we use are simply various mineral salts, which are mixed up to provide the optimum food needed by each plant family. We use common salts such as calcium nitrate or potassium phosphate. The salt mixture does not contain synthetic compounds such as hormones. Different plant families have different needs, for example, did you know that plants which flower require a very different food from aromatic herbs? We'll provide you with the exact mixture of salts for your garden! </p>
<p><b>- What is the current Citysens garden made of?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are working on finding the most suitable material to create a quality product that respects the environment. We are evaluating the use of bioplastics made from renewable biomass. In the Citysens garden, plants grow on rockwool and peach pits. The peach pit is a waste of the juice industry, which we reuse to become an ideal medium for the roots to find the water and food that the plant needs. </p>
<p><b>- Is there a warranty?</b></p>
<p>Yes, all our products come with a 2 year warranty and we will pass CE and FCC certifications.<br/></p>
<p><b>- I have a shop where I want to sell Citysens'
gardens, who should I contact? </b></p>
<p>Brilliant! Lets talk: mail us at
hola@citysens.com or call us on +34 606197713</p>

<h3>Datos medioambientales</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>Cada año, 10.000 millones de plantas se tiran a la basura porque son muy bonitas cuando las compramos pero después no podemos cuidar de ellas. De hecho, mucha gente no tiene plantas porque se ha frustrado después de que se le mueran todas. Otros no tienen tiempo o espacio para disfrutar de ellas. <p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/935812/files/20141016095539-citysens_051_short.jpg?1413478539"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>Queremos solucionar estos problemas con una herramienta única: el jardín Citysens. </span></p>
<p><span>- Hecho con biopolímero</span></p>
<p><span>- Ahorra hasta un 50% en agua y nutrientes respecto al sistema tradicional</span></p>
<p><span>- Con un consumo eléctrico de menos de 3 euros/año (gracias a que la bomba de bajo consumo se conecta automáticamente solo 25 min al día)</span></p>
<p><span>- Transforma no solo el espacio pero también las ciudades, convirtiendo cada rincón, cada casa, cada oficina, en espacios más verdes y con aire más puro.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<div>
<h3><b>Tecnología al servicio de las personas</b></h3>
<p>¿Sabías que las plantas se nutren de sales minerales que absorben de la tierra? </p>
<p>En la tierra, bacterias y lombrices transforman la materia orgánica en sales minerales que es el alimento de las plantas. Citysens funciona sin tierra. Así evitas suciedad y ganas comodidad.Utilizando la tecnología llamada hidroponía somos capaces de aportar las sales minerales que cada planta necesita mediante el agua de riego. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/965525/files/20141028064426-gota.jpg?1414503866"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p></p>
<p>En vez de tierra, utilizamos lana de roca y huesos de melocotón. Los huesos de melocotón son un residuo de la industria del zumo que en nuestro jardines Citysens ayudan a las raíces a encontrar el agua, los nutrientes y el oxígeno que necesitan. La hidroponía tiene varias ventajas:</p>
<p>- Ensucia menos</p>
<p>- Las plantas necesitan menos espacio para crecer igual</p>
<p>- La estructura pesa menos</p>
<p>- El agua y los nutrientes pueden ser reutilizados </p>
<br/>

<h3>La historia compartida de Citysens</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Citysens nació hace más de 2 años, cuando Xavi Rius montó su primer jardín vertical hidropónico de tomates en su oficina. En este tiempo, Xavi estaba terminando su tesis doctoral en nanosensores en la Universitat Rovira i Virgili de Tarragona (España).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Después de terminar la tesis doctoral, Xavi se asoció con Francisco Andrade y Par (miembros del Innovation Hub de la Universitat Rovira i Virgili) para explorar las oportunidades detrás de la relación de personas y naturaleza en las ciudades. Descubrimos que las principales barreras para disfrutar de la naturaleza en las ciudades son el tiempo, el espacio y la experiencia ... así que empezamos Citysens para solucionar eso! </p>

Meet the new Citysens garden









Citysens helps you enjoy more plants with less hassle. Due to its modular design, you can personalise it to suit your own space. Its automatic irrigation system ensures your plants will survive the most careless of us. Now you can easily make your home, office or working space a greener place with the new Citysens garden.
Uniquely green


Enjoy more plants, worry less. Enjoy up to 8 plants in the space of 1. Citysens incorporates an automatic irrigation system that takes care of your plants on daily basis alowing them to grow healthy and look great. The system lasts for 1 to 2 months without needing to refill the base.







Affordable and customizable







Citysens is the perfect gift. Citysens can be assembled in just 5 minutes by any person. You can also personalise the height and the direction of the pods to fit your own style. 
It is affordable; once you have a Citysens garden you'll only need to fill the water reservoir with water and nutrients once every 40-60 days. The necessary power consumption to pump the water and nutrients upwards is less than 3€/year. We'll provide nutrients for your garden with an estimated price of 30€/year (37$/year). 





Rewards







                   - Shipment to Spain is for free - 
INTERNATIONAL GARDEN OFFER: 10 € EUshipment 


      - we'll send you the full vertical garden in a box! -




Your home, your garden








Its unique design
allows you to transform any spot. It's designed to surprise your visitors and
for you to experience the scent of a garden all year round. 







Personalize your garden according to your taste. You can choose colour and plant family. There are two available colours: ivory and dark brown.

We will contact you by the end of the campaign for the structure colour and plant family choice.
Choose from our variety of plant families, the one that best suits you and the light conditions of your space: each plant family creates a unique atmosphere! Placid Blue (indoors, mid light)
Vital Red (indoors, bright light)


Pure Green (indoors, low light)



Aromatic Green (outdoors, direct sun)




We will contact you by the end of the campaign for the structure colour and plant family choice.


Environmental facts


Every year, 10 billion plants are thrown away all over the world because of a lack of proper care. In fact, many of us don't have plants because we feel frustated by them. Others don't have the time or the space to enjoy them. 




At Citysens we want to solve these issues with a unique garden:
- It’s made of bioplastic, from renewable biomass.
- You save up to 50% in water and mineral salts compared to traditional systems.
- Power consumption of less than 3€/year (thanks to its low-consumption water pump which is automatically turned on for 15 min per day)
- Transforms not only our spaces but also our cities: enjoy a greener environment and cleaner air.




Technology at your service
Did you know that plants feed on various mineral salts that they absorb from soil? In soil, bacteria and worms transform organic matter into these mineral salts. Citysens works without soil. In this way, we avoid dirt and achieve a lighter vertical structure. Using the technology of hydroponics, we are able to deliver the optimal mixture of mineral salts that each family of plant needs using our automatic irrigation system. 

Instead of soil we use rockwool and peach pits. Our peach pits are recycled from the juice industry and they helps roots find the water, nutrients and oxygen they need.
Hydroponics have several advantatges:
- Less dirt
- Lighter structure
- Plants require less space
- Water and nutrients can be reused







Citysens' shared story




Citysens began more than 2 years ago when Xavi first constructed a hydroponic vertical garden with tomatoes. At this time he was finishing his doctoral thesis in nanosensors at the Universitat Rovira i Virgili in Tarragona (Spain). 
After finishing the doctoral thesis, Xavi teamed up with Francisco Andrade and Par Blanking (members at the Innovation Hub of the Universitat Rovira i Virgili) and together started exploring the opportunities behind the relationship between people and nature in the city. We discovered that the main barriers preventing people from enjoying nature in cities are time, space and expertise...so we started Citysens in order to solve that! 











After talking to more than 250 people and experimenting with 5 prototypes, we developed the first Citysens garden. The first viable Citysens design had an excelent feedback from our first 70 clients. Nowadays, these first clients are our friends, and together we have improved the design to what you can see today. 


The Citysens team has grown to continue to strive for excellence in our design: today the team is formed of Maria Rius (Nua Arquitectures), Blanca Serres, David Gironès, Par Blanking (Borders Crossing), Francisco Andrade (Innovation Hub) and Xavi Rius. We partnered up with Lucid Product Agency and Pixel Moreno to bring market the best Citysens experience.







Our name CITYSENS arises from the essence of our values: we want to improve citizens quality of life through the development of innovative solutions, making our cities a better place to live in. That is why we care about our environmental impact, work with special employment centers and produce our products in Europe.
Citysens is a new experience that allows the average person to be in close contact with nature in their own space. Now we need your support: collaborate with this crowdfunding campaign to make Citysens viable and transform our cities into greener spaces. 






Use of funds

Your contributions are vital for the future of the project. Without them, we won't be able to afford the costly initial investment to make the new Citysens garden a reality. The money of your contributions will be used in:


Design refinement (10% of the total amount) - we're listening to your opinion!
Injection Molds (60%)
Tooling Costs (20%)
FCC/CE Certification (10%)



For hardware products, the more we make, the cheaper the cost of the production setup and to the molds. Moreover, our suppliers apply minimum order quantities. The goal of this campaign is to secure 400 orders as the minimum amount of orders to start the production of Citysens. 






Timeline


We'll use the funds of this campaign to produce the best Citysens garden ever! This is our timeline:



November - Mid December: making lots of new Indiegogo friends
Mid December - January: design refinement and finalizing prototypes
February: manufacturing agreements and place the tooling orders 
March: quality assurance, product homologation and product validation
April: pre-production build and pilot production
May: begin manufacturing for the  bioplastic-based injection molded parts
June: finalise the assembly and shipment process


Team and partners

We are very proud that our team and partners have a vast experience in the design and development of new products and the development of new business models.













Risks and challenges


We want to secure the maximum quality of such an awesome product. Although we have experience in the product design and manufacturing, these are some of the risks we are exposed to:



Manufacturing: creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this size is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. Creating the best molds for a product of this size is vital and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility we're working with tooling manufacturers partners with a track record for prompt quality.


Product adjustments: as Citysens gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes will be made to test and refine the product. These will always be for the benefit of you, the best clients ever. We will let you know exactly how the process is advancing.


Fulfilment: sometimes things go ugly and can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could happen. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will locate and contact at least one back-up supplier for each part of the process.


FAQs

- What happens when plants grow too big? 

The plants we have chosen for the Citysens garden are medium size plants that do not grow very large. Remember, that because we use hydroponics, the plant’s roots will always have water and nutrients readily available and so do not grow as big as in soil (where they need to search for water and nutrients). If you ever want to change a plant, you can do it easily: take the plant out and carefully transplant it to a pot with soil. Be aware, you'll have to water it daily then! 
- Does the Citysens garden need to be plugged?
Yes. Citysens garden includes a small pump coupled to
a timer that needs to be plugged to a power source. Our aim is that you can
avoid the constant watering of plants. Be aware the power consumption of the
pump is very low, less than 3 €/year! If this small power consumption allows
you to have more beautiful plants at home, we believe that spending on
electricity is well justified! Besides, there are now companies that offer
electricity from renewable sources, did you know? 
- Do you use a pump? Is it noisy?

Yes, we use a pump to automatically water and feed plants every day. We selected our pump from 8 different options and made sure to select the quietest one, which makes practically no noise.
- Can I choose the plants for my Citysens garden?

Yes, once the campaign is over we will send a form to all our backers so they can choose their desired plant family. Backers will choose among four plant families: life red, pure green, placid blue and green aromas. Choice will be made according to personal tastes and taking into acount the light requirements of the plant family. We are working to offer new plant families soon. 
- What colours are available for the Citysens garden?

Once the campaign is over we will send a form to all our backers so they can choose their desired colour for the structure. The Citysens garden is available in ivory white and dark brown to best suit the décor of your space. 
- What are Citysens nutrients made of?

The nutrients we use are simply various mineral salts, which are mixed up to provide the optimum food needed by each plant family. We use common salts such as calcium nitrate or potassium phosphate. The salt mixture does not contain synthetic compounds such as hormones. Different plant families have different needs, for example, did you know that plants which flower require a very different food from aromatic herbs? We'll provide you with the exact mixture of salts for your garden! 
- What is the current Citysens garden made of?

We are working on finding the most suitable material to create a quality product that respects the environment. We are evaluating the use of bioplastics made from renewable biomass. In the Citysens garden, plants grow on rockwool and peach pits. The peach pit is a waste of the juice industry, which we reuse to become an ideal medium for the roots to find the water and food that the plant needs. 
- Is there a warranty?
Yes, all our products come with a 2 year warranty and we will pass CE and FCC certifications.
- I have a shop where I want to sell Citysens'
gardens, who should I contact? 
Brilliant! Lets talk: mail us at
hola@citysens.com or call us on +34 606197713

Datos medioambientales


Cada año, 10.000 millones de plantas se tiran a la basura porque son muy bonitas cuando las compramos pero después no podemos cuidar de ellas. De hecho, mucha gente no tiene plantas porque se ha frustrado después de que se le mueran todas. Otros no tienen tiempo o espacio para disfrutar de ellas. 

Queremos solucionar estos problemas con una herramienta única: el jardín Citysens. 
- Hecho con biopolímero
- Ahorra hasta un 50% en agua y nutrientes respecto al sistema tradicional
- Con un consumo eléctrico de menos de 3 euros/año (gracias a que la bomba de bajo consumo se conecta automáticamente solo 25 min al día)
- Transforma no solo el espacio pero también las ciudades, convirtiendo cada rincón, cada casa, cada oficina, en espacios más verdes y con aire más puro.


Tecnología al servicio de las personas
¿Sabías que las plantas se nutren de sales minerales que absorben de la tierra? 
En la tierra, bacterias y lombrices transforman la materia orgánica en sales minerales que es el alimento de las plantas. Citysens funciona sin tierra. Así evitas suciedad y ganas comodidad.Utilizando la tecnología llamada hidroponía somos capaces de aportar las sales minerales que cada planta necesita mediante el agua de riego. 
 
En vez de tierra, utilizamos lana de roca y huesos de melocotón. Los huesos de melocotón son un residuo de la industria del zumo que en nuestro jardines Citysens ayudan a las raíces a encontrar el agua, los nutrientes y el oxígeno que necesitan. La hidroponía tiene varias ventajas:
- Ensucia menos
- Las plantas necesitan menos espacio para crecer igual
- La estructura pesa menos
- El agua y los nutrientes pueden ser reutilizados 



La historia compartida de Citysens



Citysens nació hace más de 2 años, cuando Xavi Rius montó su primer jardín vertical hidropónico de tomates en su oficina. En este tiempo, Xavi estaba terminando su tesis doctoral en nanosensores en la Universitat Rovira i Virgili de Tarragona (España).

Después de terminar la tesis doctoral, Xavi se asoció con Francisco Andrade y Par (miembros del Innovation Hub de la Universitat Rovira i Virgili) para explorar las oportunidades detrás de la relación de personas y naturaleza en las ciudades. Descubrimos que las principales barreras para disfrutar de la naturaleza en las ciudades son el tiempo, el espacio y la experiencia ... así que empezamos Citysens para solucionar eso! 
   

Después de hablar con más de 250 personas y de iterar con 5 primeros prototipos, desarrollamos el primer jardín Citysens: un primer diseño viable de Citysens que ha tenido una excelente acogida por parte de los primeros 70 clientes. Hoy en día, estos primeros clientes son nuestros amigos ya que juntos hemos mejorado el diseño del nuevo jardín Citysens. 

El equipo de Citysens ha crecido para llevar al mercado la mejor experiencia Citysens: hoy el equipo está formado por Maria Rius (Nua Arquitecturas), Blanca Serres, David Gironès, Par Blanking (Borders Crossing), Francisco Andrade (Innovation Hub) y Xavi Rius. Hemos formado equipo también con la agencia de diseño de producto Lúcid y el estudio de fotografía Pixel Moreno.

Nuestro nombre CITYSENS surgió de la esencia de nuestros valores: queremos mejorar la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos de todo el mundo a través del desarrollo de soluciones innovadoras. Trabajamos para minimizar nuestro impacto medioambiental, colaboramos con centros especiales de trabajo y con escuelas, y producimos nuestros productos en España. 
Citysens es una nueva experiencia que nos permite estar en contacto con la naturaleza en la ciudad. 
Necesitamos su apoyo a esta campaña de micromecenazgo para hacer Citysens viable y transformar nuestras ciudades en espacios más verdes.

</div></div>","Important Update
We just moved our campaign to Kickstarter:
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/776610089/dlab-the-coolest-mobile-t-shirt-shop
It looks really unlikely that we can reach our goal by the end of the campaign on Indiegogo and we also believe Kickstarter has a more supportive community for project like ours. 
So we wanna try our luck on Kickstarter.
How about the money you already contributed?
The campaign is fixed funding one, which means the money you contributed will refund back to your bank account or Paypal when the campaign is failed. 
If you still want to support us, we welcome you come to our Kickstarter page :)

We often see lots of young artist share some really awesome art works or illustrations online, the first thing comes to our mind is why not help them turn those cool arts into t-shirts and let more people can see their efforts and talents. Those designs are way better than the most common logo tees or cartoon tees on the market. This is the reason why we launched our online t-shirt crowdfunding community – Dlab.so in 2015. But before that, we have spent one whole year to learn how to make a high quality t-shirt and to build partnerships with reliable suppliers and manufacturers. Besides a brilliant design, we also want to bring a quality product to our customers. As a young startup company full of young and brave minds, we always like to try something new and different. That’s why we decide to build the first mobile t-shirt shop in China, though we are taking some unknown policy risks doing so. But we are not afraid, we are young. And we believe the mobile shop will help us increase those artists’ publicity as we can carry their works around the city and more people will be aware of it. We want those young artists to succeed and live a decent life by doing what they love to do. If their dreams come true, our dream comes true. 
We have worked long and hard collaborating with dozens of young artists and selecting awesome designs during the past few months. We also spent lots of effort helping them modify the design and make it looks more suitable on a t-shirt. 














We only listed 10 out of 50 designs above.
Click crowdfunding.dlab.so to check the whole design collection in larger picture for this campaign. 
On that page, you can click through each design and remember to note down the design number you like when fill out the survey afterwards.






The  Shirts:We choose 100% ring-spun premium cotton as blanks to print on. It’s pre-shrunk, softy and comfy also with a slight better fit. It worth every penny you spend. Printing:And due to the big design pool, we using DTG (Direct to Garment) printing technique rather than traditional silk screen printing to meet the flexible production requirement. Sizing:We offer unisex crew-neck with sizes from XS to 2XL.Suggested Size:We will officially start to run our website www.dlab.so once the crowdfunding campaign is ended. We will keep improving website’s user experience for international users. 
Most importantly, we will continue to work with talented young artists and scout more awesome designs for you. 
Want to be one of the designers? Drop us an email at ""service@dlab.so"" or submit your design at our website directly. We will help you open the biggest the t-shirt market in the world - China.

Check the video below (from Chris Wells) of the Moganshan Rd art community.






We agreed to share 20% “sales revenue” of any copyrighted products sold with the artist, so this time we won't leave us much net profits.

Each and every piece in our line is printed by a woman who was once at risk, or exploited, in the commercial sex trade. We stand to strengthen the one-to-one connection between the consumer and the survivor. Printed inside each piece is the story of a survivor who had a hand in printing that actual item, through which we strive to empower you to share the journey of the women who made your garment.
We are planning to officially launch the Biographe brand this holiday season, when we will sell our garments in select boutique stores throughout New York City. In order to make that happen, we still need additional funding to continue to pay the women’s salaries, cover rent and utility costs, and purchase additional inventory for our official launch.
We have already set up our facility in Bangkok, trained our staff, and run a successful pilot program after bringing local New York artists into the mix. Now we turn to you to help push us over the edge and launch our brand by helping us reach our $30,000 goal!
Who are we?
The story of The Blind Project began with three New York City roommates and one book. After reading Gary Haugen's account on the rescue of young girls from Cambodian brothels in Haugen's book ""Terrify No More,"" Anthony, Chad, and Liem decided to get off their proverbial couch and 'do something.'
They quit their jobs to travel through Southeast Asia and document the issue first-hand, in search of ways to combat the problem. What they found ultimately changed their lives. Women and girls as young as ten years old were locked in brothels with no hope and no future. They were - and still are - sold and resold as meaningless commodities, carelessly passed from one owner to the next. Often times, even after women are rescued, many fall back into the sex trade because of their limited resources, scarce economic opportunities and/or negative social stigmas.So moved by what they saw, Anthony, Chad, and Liem returned to New York City determined to find a way to pool the unique talents of their friends and empower victims of the commercial sex trade. Since then, this collective of individuals has evolved into The Blind Project. Providing gainful employment to sex trade survivors is where our talents met her needs, and the idea for Biographe was born.
Biographe
In striving to apply for-profit market strategies to a non-profit social purpose, Biographe is our answer. By training survivors in marketable job skills (screenprinting and design) while maintaining a supportive, open environment where their stories are shared and embraced, we aim to break the vicious cycle that continues to fuel the sex trade around the world. We employ our staff at our Bangkok facility, which we have dubbed the 'Biographe Lab.' All of the proceeds from our apparel line will be reinvested into our partner organizations in Asia that provide rescue and aftercare efforts for survivors of the sex trade. Here in New York, our fashion designers have been developing custom-designed garments for the Biographe label, which will feature artwork created by select DACS (Designers Against Child Slavery) artists. This artwork will be silk-screened into our garments by survivors. 
A $50 pledge will give you a choice to receive either the women's draped tank or the men's henley before we even sell them in stores.


Building a Brand With Artists
Be a Biographer + Episodes Exhibition
We are also excited to offer a selection of original artwork that have and continue to impact the designs that will be printed into our Biographe garments. 
Artists submitted original designs during our 'Be A Biographer' design competition based upon one of three women's stories that we had posted online. Voting for this competition was crowdsourced online, where twenty designs below were voted in as the finalists. These prints were displayed in our Episodes Exhibition in downtown Manhattan last Fall.
 With a $75 pledge you will receive a 10"" x 10"" print of your choice.With a $250 pledge you will receive a 24"" x 36"" canvas print of one of the following designs displayed at the Episodes Exhibition by DACS artists. These artists are some of the very people who will be designing graphics for Biographe. This prize is VERY limited as we only have one print of each piece. (Please take a look at the Updates section to see which unique piece of artwork is left).
Biographe Beta
At the close of the 'Be a Biographer' competition, we used the three winning designs to build a pilot program in Bangkok, where we trained the Biographe Lab ladies how to silkscreen.
With a $100 pledge you will receive a 8"" x 10"" screen-pulled print of the winning design of your choice, framed and also signed by the women at the Biographe Lab.
 

 
When the ladies graduated to silkscreening designs onto stock shirts in Bangkok, we named our first-ever edition production run of tees 'Biographe Beta.' These tees from our original run are available for those who pledge $25 or more.A pledge of $15 you will get you a special 'Thank You' handkerchief, hand silkscreened by the women at our Biographe Lab.  
 
Our Biographe ID bracelets are made of a plaited, stainless steel metal chain with a clear, moulded plastic name plate. The clean slate of the name plate symbolizes the opportunity to start afresh for not only the women working in our Biographe lab, but all over the world. What would typically be a full circle of chain is interrupted by this clear space that breaks the vicious cycle which women in the sex trade have come to know as the norm. Likewise, we believe that each woman should be given the opportunity to be in control of her destiny. 
 
With a pledge of $35 you will have the choice to receive one of the below.

<h3>The Story of One Crafty Gamer Chick</h3>
<p>We all know how it goes. You bought a few sets of polyhedral dice, maybe a few blocks of d6's, and maybe even have a few things like fake gold coins or your homemade Deck of Many Things or Critical Hit Deck. You could keep them all in your pockets, but then there's so much fumbling when you need your phone or your keys. You could just use a bag from some booze or jelly beans, but those aren't always the highest quality. They were only meant to hold sweet, sweet liquor or candy. But what to do then?</p>
<p>Well, we have the answer! Why not get a bag from <em><strong>One Crafty Gamer Chick</strong></em>? In a variety of styles and formats, her bags will hold things. Your things specifically!</p>
<p>But if you want her bags to hold your things, well, you will need some help.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here's the skinny. The basic things we would need, and what we'd be buying with all this money: </p>
<ul>
<li>A new sewing machine that can handle the high volume of bags we'd be putting out. </li>
<li>The web domain and the wonderful web designer we have lined up to help us make this into the best bag site you'll ever see.</li>
<li>All the raw materials we can craft into your bags!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, as for what the resulting lines would be: </p>
<ul>
<li>Simple, for when you want to be bold, yet understated</li>
<li>Little Bits, a classic video game inspired line full of plumbers, invaders and monsters. It's dangerous to go alone; take a dice bag!</li>
<li>Quest, a fantasy inspired line, for all you Pathfinder, Arrowflight, D&amp;D and Warhammer players!</li>
<li>Crafty, for when you really want to think about hunting for diamonds and avoiding Creepers!</li>
<li>Royal, a line for the more feminine gamer, inspired by your favorite princesses. </li>
<li>Heroic, a comic inspired line for everyone, from Amazon princesses to alien refugees, orphaned billionaires to radioactive teenagers!</li>
<li>SPAAAAACE!, our science fiction inspired line of bags, for anyone who has ever wanted to hang with a Wookiee, a Klingon, a Cylon or a Time Lord to fight some Daleks, Sith or Xenomorphs. Or you could just go to a moon of Jupiter, but stay off Europa. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>And all lines will have bags in four different sizes: Mini, Standard, Deluxe and Premium! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, we would like to mention, this is one person making these, so if this totally explodes with people wanting our bags, we may end up a little behind on orders. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Yep, that was a Portal joke up there</h3>
<p>Sorry, using the Portal joke when the Portal-inspired bags are probably going to be in the Little Bits line.</p>
<p>Honestly, this whole idea was started with a bag that was made by the Crafty Gamer Chick for a birthday, and soon everyone wanted one. And so we thought, why not make these available for everyone? They make good gifts, and last for years. And table top gamers everywhere sure could use some more bags for all those dozens and dozens of dice they have.</p>

<li>Carmazzi 1bag can be a backpack, carry-on suitcase, messenger bag, briefcase, Duffle-bag or anything else that suits the occasion you have. As a customer, you do Not Need to Buy Everything, ONLY what suits your lifestyle and personal Needs... So you spend accordingly.</li>
<li>HOW IT WORKS<br/>There are three basic panels; the left panel, the central panel and the right panel. Each is independent to each other and each is reversible and can be used  with different pocket or no pockets. You can add accessories to the bag to create different types, styles, and shapes. You can combine with the straps which also double as expanders to make compartments bigger. add larger expanders to make it as big as you need (even packing for a full month trip) There are many 3rd party fashion and technical accessory developers also (hey, let us know if you are interested). Many specialty pockets are designed for different types of technology and convenience. See below. </li>

</h3><h3></h3><p></p>How it all started.<p>I started a brand called Nico Alexander back in 2009 out of a passion for just needing to create.  I worked hard and eventually around 2011 that idea turned into Alexander People a jewelry brand.  A brand that I envisioned to be the starting point of something much bigger.  I worked and worked from that time until 2012.  I had all the ideas, designs, concepts and passion to start it but I quickly realized that wasn't enough.  I felt like a kite that got a great gust of wind and was soaring then fell on flat air.  The reality is it takes money and money is the thing I was lacking, so I put my dreams on lay by.  Now I am at the place where I am dying to start this new Beloved Collection that I have envisioned, but Mr. Money keeps pounding on the door saying it will never happen but something within me cannot give up, this collection is too important to not try!  Then I had the idea to try to see if some of my friends, family, and indiegogo lovers that want to see this Beloved Collection happen as much as I do would rally in and support this vision and see this collection made... So I've come to this.  I have my 25th birthday coming in July and everyone asks me what I want to do or what I want for my birthday. I have thought long and hard and with everything in me this is what I want.  To see this dream become something tangible.  Not just a spark of a start up but a trailblazer that starts off with one thing then branches out.  Everyone has been asking me whats going on with Alexander People and when I am going to come out with more so lets see if I can get this show on the road!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>What is the Beloved Collection?</h3><p>The Beloved collection is something that came to me one day during some business planning and I think it was an idea that had been sitting inside waiting for the right time to come out.  The Beloved Collection will be a ring collection made entirely by hand.  It will be a collection that celebrates women's unique individuality and beauty.  Each ring made will have its own unique stone, so no two rings will be the same.  The stones will vary and the vision behind this is for each stone to represent each individual woman, some stones may be somewhat similar or completely different to all of the rest.  That is how I see women.  Although we may feel like we are just like everyone else and we sometimes feel like we don't stand out or if we feel so different from everyone else that we feel as though we don't fit, we are unique individuals and should celebrate our similarities and our differences.  We often times look at a gemstone and view it as precious, so as a women I thought how incredible it would be to flip the script and have a ring that is a reflection of being the precious and amazing women that we are.  In addition to the unique stone, each ring will be engraved inside with ""Beloved"" followed by their name.  For example: ""Beloved Nicole.""  This engraving is a statement.  Beloved, by definition is to be dearly loved, or a person who is loved dearly.  I believe that not enough women see themselves that way.  It is addressing each individual woman as someone who is dearly loved.  Whatever walk of life or place in life a woman may be I think there needs to be such importance placed on the fact that they are dearly loved.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/684210/files/20140630064332-IMG_7030.jpg?1404135812"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Why is the Beloved Collection so important?</span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>My passion is to help others so not only will I focus on the creative side in making beautiful jewelry, but I want to form a brand that honors women, that celebrates women for the unique individuals that they are.  I want to encourage and inspire women to be confident in their own skin and not compromise themselves for anything.  This is the passion behind the dream, to set a higher standard for women to see themselves with more value and to inspire them!  <br/></p><p>I think there is need right now in fashion for women to have something that is specifically for the individual.  Something affordable that doesn't required you to be a celebrity or have some sort of status to have something uniquely yours.    This line will make each individual customer unique.  </p><p>This line makes a bold statement: <b> ""You are you and that is something to be celebrated, you are a beautiful and precious individual who is dearly loved.""</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><br/><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">What I need funding for.</span><br/></p><p></p><p>I need funding for everything from tools to website updating.  The majority of the funding will go to jewelry supplies, as I want to source quality supplies.  As the jewelry I made before didn't require many tools, for this line I will basically have to start from scratch with the majority of the tools I will need.  I also want to have clear and cohesive branding so that means investing into business cards, tags, and general branding, I want to create beautiful branding and packaging that I would be proud to send out to customers.  Since business will mainly be e-commerce my old website has to go, also new domain, and new location...not WIX based...sorry wix.   I will be using shopify, this means I will have to create a new website from scratch and pay monthly for it.  </p><p><b>Cost Breakdown</b></p><p>Tools: $1515</p><p>Branding: $660</p><p>Packaging: $450 (boxes and jewelry bags)</p><p>Jewelry Supplies: $3550</p><p>New Website: $1162 (design + 1yr Shopify subscription + domain)</p><p>Product and Lookbook photoshoots: $250</p><p>Indiegogo 7% Fee: Roughly $600</p><p><b>Total : $8,200</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/684215/files/20140630064537-IMG_7163-2.jpg?1404135937"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><b><br/></b><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">What happens if it doesn't get funded?</span><br/></p><p>Well if unfortunately it doesn't get funded than this ""Beloved Collection"" dream will sadly have to get filed away to where dream go in waiting.  I don't want to do flexible funding which would allow me to keep whatever funds I raise because it's a project that requires all or nothing.  I don't think its fair for anyone if I keep the money but don't meet the goal because I honestly won't be able to produce and launch the collection if the goal isn't met I will still keep planning but I will just be in planning phase indefinitely.  However I am really believing that with your help this dream can move out of the planning phase!

It's kind of awkward.  I had this great idea to have an incredible pitch video made in the last week of June before I launched the campaign and then...I got the flu.  I currently still have the flu as I am writing this.  Not fun.  As it is just about to be July and I am determined to run this campaign through July I had to make the decision to not make you endure a two minute pitch video of my sickly self as I currently sound like a cross between a monotone frog and Bill Stein, so I decided to give you as much information as possible here and have the photos and video from my previous lookbooks showing unique women from all walks of life.  I will however upload one later in the campaign!   What happens if you go over the goal?If I reach the goal and over I will be able to do so much more than start!  I will be starting with the ""Beloved Collection"" so if I raise more than the goal it will allow me to work on more of the crazy projects and ideas I have in this crazy brain.  It will also mean I can launch sooner!  If I get way over my goal I might even be able to rent a studio to work out of instead of my house!  Trust me I need the extra room!So where do we go from here?You can contribute to seeing this happen!! Even if you are a guy and you feel like this doesn't relate to you, if you know a woman who doesn't think they fit in or standout please consider being a part of a campaign that celebrates these amazing women whether they are your mother, sister, wife, friend, etc!  Contributions big and small are what is going to get this dream moving forward but honestly if you are not able to financially contribute even getting the word out and making a bit of noise about the campaign could help. Let's see if I can celebrate 25 with a dream come true hey!!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Kevlar is the registered trademark for a para-aramid synthetic fiber, related to other aramids such as Nomex and Technora. Developed by Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont in 1965, this high-strength material was first commercially used in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires. Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components.</p>
<p>Currently, Kevlar has many applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to bulletproof vests, because of its high tensile strength-to-weight ratio; by this measure it is 5 times stronger than steel. It is also used to make modern drumheads that withstand high impact. When used as a woven material, it is suitable for mooring lines and other underwater applications.</p>

ALPHAGRID is a technical gear brand founded in 2017 by Sam Lee who worked as a bag designer about 10 years. 
The brand’s philosophy is focused on providing the highest quality high-end bag products. ALPHAGRID, This Korea-based brand, reinterprets its basic design concept and functional details from military luggage into modern technologies and usages. 
For the ultimate endurance and functions, all the products of ALPHAGRID are made of the finest nylon fabric mixed with DuPont™ Kevlar®, Fidlock® Magnetic Buckle, YKK® Waterproof Fastner, ITW NEXUS Plastic Parts etc. 
With uncompromising production control for its high quality, ALPHAGRID will never stop challenging to make the best technical bags.
 
 
MATERIAL
 
 

TERAMID® is a super tenacious fabric reinforced with DuPont™ KEVLAR® brand fiber.
 

Kevlar is the registered trademark for a para-aramid synthetic fiber, related to other aramids such as Nomex and Technora. Developed by Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont in 1965, this high-strength material was first commercially used in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires. Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components.
Currently, Kevlar has many applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to bulletproof vests, because of its high tensile strength-to-weight ratio; by this measure it is 5 times stronger than steel. It is also used to make modern drumheads that withstand high impact. When used as a woven material, it is suitable for mooring lines and other underwater applications.
 

Fidlock fastners are based on unique technology which has won numerous awards and which is revolutionizing conventional fastening systems.The Fidlock principle brings together the advantages of magnetic fastners and mechanical locks. The result is a new dimension in terms of functionality, safety, and fun.
 

Plastic buckles and closure components have been designed and manufactured for over 25 years by ITW Nexus. In fact, in 1977, we invented the original Side Release buckle that revolutionized the closure market. The following web catalog contains ITW Nexus’ standard plastic buckle and closure offerings of products that we have developed through the years. If you do not find a solution to your plastic hardware needs, please contact  ITW Nexus to review your exact closure demands.
All of our Military/Defense/MILSPEC hardware is 100% U.S. Berry Amendment Compliant. Proudly Made in the USA.

<h2>Roller Derby Patches </h2>
<p>When I set out to create a line of custom, high-quality roller derby patches, a fair number of people were probably more than a little confused. But they don't know what I know. Roller Derby has a long and colourful history, and because of technologies like social media and the Internet, the sport has experienced a renaissance in the last ten to twenty years.</p>
<p>Manufacturing good quality embroidery can be a challenge. When it's done right, nothing else can compare. I designed my patches to be show-pieces. They are suitable for anyone who wants to celebrate the great sport of roller derby with fellow fans, and they look spectacular on their own or affixed to team jackets, jerseys, hats, bags or any accessory. The quality of these patches is inspiring, and that is one of the chief reasons I'm starting a crowdfunding project and reaching out to my fellow fans and sports fashion enthusiasts.</p>
<p>I plan to start with an exciting and attractive line of custom patches and reward my most enthusiastic contributors with some unique and fun rewards for being a part of my campaign. I would be honoured if you would consider joining my project. With your generous support, I plan to build something unique and fun we can all share.</p>

When I set out to create a line of custom, high-quality roller derby patches, a fair number of people were probably more than a little confused. But they don't know what I know. Roller Derby has a long and colourful history, and because of technologies like social media and the Internet, the sport has experienced a renaissance in the last ten to twenty years.
Manufacturing good quality embroidery can be a challenge. When it's done right, nothing else can compare. I designed my patches to be show-pieces. They are suitable for anyone who wants to celebrate the great sport of roller derby with fellow fans, and they look spectacular on their own or affixed to team jackets, jerseys, hats, bags or any accessory. The quality of these patches is inspiring, and that is one of the chief reasons I'm starting a crowdfunding project and reaching out to my fellow fans and sports fashion enthusiasts.
I plan to start with an exciting and attractive line of custom patches and reward my most enthusiastic contributors with some unique and fun rewards for being a part of my campaign. I would be honoured if you would consider joining my project. With your generous support, I plan to build something unique and fun we can all share.

<p>I am excited to share my story with you!  In short: my battle with cancer has shaped me into the entrepreneur I am today. The therapeutic crafting activities that once served as a distraction from my illness have now given birth to a full-fledged business called Just Vicky Thingz. </p>
<p>Hi! I’m Vicky, the founder and designer of <a href=""https://justvickythingz.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Just Vicky Thingz. </a>I started this business in the bathroom of my college apartment at Virginia Tech my senior year of college. I am raising money to purchase an automatic Hotronix heat press machine and would love your support! Keep reading to learn more about the inspiration behind my brand.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.collegiatetimes.com/lifestyles/meet-the-hokie-behind-relay-s-acid-dyed-shirts/article_3f5906f8-40d9-11e8-bf72-0332dca5308b.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Background:</a></strong></p>
<p>When I was only 6 years old I was diagnosed with <a href=""http://www.collegiatetimes.com/lifestyles/meet-the-hokie-behind-relay-s-acid-dyed-shirts/article_3f5906f8-40d9-11e8-bf72-0332dca5308b.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A.L.L Leukemia</a> and underwent treatment for two and a half years. One of my strongest memories from my treatment was making wire and bead fairies with Margy the craft lady. During my treatment sessions, you could find me at the arts and crafts table in my doctors’ office. There I created tons of crafts, some of which I still have today. I believe that my experience with cancer helped develop my creative mind and passion for crafting.</p>
<p>As a college student, I continued to craft. I made a variety of pieces including wall hangings, signs, canvases and much more for my apartment. Aside from decorations, I also enjoyed making clothing. During my senior year at <a href=""http://www.collegiatetimes.com/lifestyles/meet-the-hokie-behind-relay-s-acid-dyed-shirts/article_3f5906f8-40d9-11e8-bf72-0332dca5308b.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Virginia Tech</a> and the fall 2017 football season I wanted to find something unique to wear to a game. So I decided to combine my love for Virginia Tech with my love for crafting. I tried something new and trendy and made an acid dye a gray T-shirt from a shirt that I bought at a thrift store.  When I shared a picture of the shirt I made on Snapchat, I was shocked by the number of people who asked me to make them one</p>
<p>After football season ended, I had about  30 pre-made shirts left over. In an effort to get rid of the extra shirts, I posted on my personal craft instagram, “<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/justvickythingz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@Justvickythingz</a>,” that I was going to conduct a flash sale. To my surprise, the shirts sold out within an hour. Not only did the shirts sell out, but I also received an excessive amount of orders. As I began to get overwhelmed, I turned to my family for assistance. I sold over  200 shirts in just two weeks.As the word got out about the shirts, I kept receiving more orders and messages.</p>
<p>In February, Valentine’s Day to be exact, I became a registered LLC and since then Just Vicky Thingz has been expanding rapidly. Now just 10 months after opening my business, I have expanded to selling licensed greekwear, licensed “Virginia Tech” college gear, fulfilling large group orders and fundraising events like <a href=""http://www.collegiatetimes.com/lifestyles/meet-the-hokie-behind-relay-s-acid-dyed-shirts/article_3f5906f8-40d9-11e8-bf72-0332dca5308b.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VT’s Relay for life</a>. I am currently working on launching more college collections. My goal for the company is to obtain more licenses for colleges across the country. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543281858/j9uvmucm4kcsb1qwwgc5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cancer has played a major role in the development of this business, as the disease is what developed my passion for crafting. My fond memories of working with the craft lady have always stuck with me. I am not sure that I would have ever become the creative business owner I am today if I was not given the chance to craft daily for two and a half years. One of my favorite quotes and personal motto states,  </p>
<p>“grow through what you go through.” I grew through my experience with cancer by using crafting as a steady hand to hold.  What once served as a distraction from my illness has now created a rapidly growing business. </p>
<p>Following my crowdfunding campaign, I will be working on replacing my broken machine, expanding to new customers, and purchasing more licenses for colleges. I am hopeful for what is to come. </p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://justvickythingz.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Why JVT?</a></strong></p>
<p>Every shirt is hand dyed and no two ever look the same. Just Vicky Thingz (JVT) shirts are unique and one-of-a-kind. When we ship a shirt to a new customer we are sending a message to them that they have a shirt no one else has.. We inspire our customers to be different and try new things. Every shirt is worn in a different way. From knotted to cut shirts we love seeing all the different fashion styles our customers come up with!</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/justvickythingz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">JustVICKYThingz</a> shirts incorporate the old tie-dye culture from the  70s that encouraged people to express their free-spirited nature. We market our hand-dyed shirts with one goal:to be unique.  At JVT, it is our hope that our hand-crafted gear will motivate our customers to make differences in their communities. </p>

<p><a href=""https://justvickythingz.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Here’s How You Can Help!</strong></a></p>
<p>With your support,  JVT will purchase a new Hotronix professional heat press machine, purchase more licenses for colleges, and do more fundraisers and partnerships for charities. Each college license is bought individually and grants you full access to use the official logo, mascot, and slogan for that specific university or college. Past partnerships include fundraising events for <a href=""http://www.collegiatetimes.com/lifestyles/meet-the-hokie-behind-relay-s-acid-dyed-shirts/article_3f5906f8-40d9-11e8-bf72-0332dca5308b.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VT’s Relay for life</a>, Maryland’s Relay for Life, Sigma Kappa’s walk to end Alzheimer’s, and Casey Shulman’s Shine On Swim-a-thon. </p>

I saw firsthand from age 6 to 8 how funding and research helps  pediatric cancer patients not only with treatment, but also in how it helps alleviate what the children are going through.  I was able to turn my sickness into a positive outlet for me to discover my passion for crafting. Because of this, JVT will donate 10% of the proceeds fundraised from this campaign to the art therapy program at my pediatric oncologist in Northern Virginia. </p>

I am raising money to purchase an automatic Hotronix heat press machine and would love your support! Keep reading to learn more about the inspiration behind my brand.
The Background:
When I was only 6 years old I was diagnosed with A.L.L Leukemia and underwent treatment for two and a half years. One of my strongest memories from my treatment was making wire and bead fairies with Margy the craft lady. During my treatment sessions, you could find me at the arts and crafts table in my doctors’ office. There I created tons of crafts, some of which I still have today. I believe that my experience with cancer helped develop my creative mind and passion for crafting.
As a college student, I continued to craft. I made a variety of pieces including wall hangings, signs, canvases and much more for my apartment. Aside from decorations, I also enjoyed making clothing. During my senior year at Virginia Tech and the fall 2017 football season I wanted to find something unique to wear to a game. So I decided to combine my love for Virginia Tech with my love for crafting. I tried something new and trendy and made an acid dye a gray T-shirt from a shirt that I bought at a thrift store.  When I shared a picture of the shirt I made on Snapchat, I was shocked by the number of people who asked me to make them one
After football season ended, I had about  30 pre-made shirts left over. In an effort to get rid of the extra shirts, I posted on my personal craft instagram, “@Justvickythingz,” that I was going to conduct a flash sale. To my surprise, the shirts sold out within an hour. Not only did the shirts sell out, but I also received an excessive amount of orders. As I began to get overwhelmed, I turned to my family for assistance. I sold over  200 shirts in just two weeks.As the word got out about the shirts, I kept receiving more orders and messages.
In February, Valentine’s Day to be exact, I became a registered LLC and since then Just Vicky Thingz has been expanding rapidly. Now just 10 months after opening my business, I have expanded to selling licensed greekwear, licensed “Virginia Tech” college gear, fulfilling large group orders and fundraising events like VT’s Relay for life. I am currently working on launching more college collections. My goal for the company is to obtain more licenses for colleges across the country. 

 
Cancer has played a major role in the development of this business, as the disease is what developed my passion for crafting. My fond memories of working with the craft lady have always stuck with me. I am not sure that I would have ever become the creative business owner I am today if I was not given the chance to craft daily for two and a half years. One of my favorite quotes and personal motto states,  
“grow through what you go through.” I grew through my experience with cancer by using crafting as a steady hand to hold.  What once served as a distraction from my illness has now created a rapidly growing business. 
Following my crowdfunding campaign, I will be working on replacing my broken machine, expanding to new customers, and purchasing more licenses for colleges. I am hopeful for what is to come. 
Why JVT?
Every shirt is hand dyed and no two ever look the same. Just Vicky Thingz (JVT) shirts are unique and one-of-a-kind. When we ship a shirt to a new customer we are sending a message to them that they have a shirt no one else has.. We inspire our customers to be different and try new things. Every shirt is worn in a different way. From knotted to cut shirts we love seeing all the different fashion styles our customers come up with!
JustVICKYThingz shirts incorporate the old tie-dye culture from the  70s that encouraged people to express their free-spirited nature. We market our hand-dyed shirts with one goal:to be unique.  At JVT, it is our hope that our hand-crafted gear will motivate our customers to make differences in their communities. 

Here’s How You Can Help!
With your support,  JVT will purchase a new Hotronix professional heat press machine, purchase more licenses for colleges, and do more fundraisers and partnerships for charities. Each college license is bought individually and grants you full access to use the official logo, mascot, and slogan for that specific university or college. Past partnerships include fundraising events for VT’s Relay for life, Maryland’s Relay for Life, Sigma Kappa’s walk to end Alzheimer’s, and Casey Shulman’s Shine On Swim-a-thon. 
As a cancer survivor, I feel inspired to give back to the community. I saw firsthand from age 6 to 8 how funding and research helps  pediatric cancer patients not only with treatment, but also in how it helps alleviate what the children are going through.  I was able to turn my sickness into a positive outlet for me to discover my passion for crafting. Because of this, JVT will donate 10% of the proceeds fundraised from this campaign to the art therapy program at my pediatric oncologist in Northern Virginia. 

Thank You!
Thank you SO MUCH for reading my story and learning more about how cancer inspired me to create my business. I hope my story will help others realize that no matter what they are going through, that they can overcome it and do things they want. I appreciate your consideration to share my campaign. All pledges are greatly appreciated.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are happy to inform you that we are starting a funding project we have worked on for six months!</p>
<p>Lives and norms in every place in the world have shifted dramatically in many ways from the beginning of the year 2020. We are confined to our home by the quarantine rules, work from home, and asked to wear a face mask every time we leave home. Fortunately, confirmed cases are going down, and some companies lifted their-work-from-home system. </p>
<p>In the midst of danger, there are heroes among us: they are volunteers from different sectors of society. They are showing courage and spreading love in helping the elderly and those who are in need. Especially, our healthcare workers, such as doctors, nurses, and emergency medical technicians.</p>
<p>It has drawn our attention that it is one of the most fundamental roles to appreciate their utmost effort in our community.</p>
<p>With our continued effort, we have created our own antibacterial fabric in hopes of contributing to our community. </p>
<p>DEAR MILER produced unique t-shirts made of antimicrobial fabrics along with symbolic messages about our sincere appreciation toward the heroes in our community. Our t-shirts are designed with different variations of symbolic shapes of hearts and New York landmarks such as the Empire State building. </p>

<p>Hi! It's nice to meet everyone! I'm Fish, the artist of <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/littlefishstickstudio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LittleFishStickStudio</a>. This is my first Indiegogo project I've ever created, so I'm excited to share it with everyone. This project, the Umbrella Ita Bag, has been in the works since June. </p>
<p>It began with the desire to do more for our community. The goal is to not only be able to produce this trans pride ita bag, but to raise funds for the Trans Women Of Color Collective (TWOCC). This campaign however is a fixed one, so it's all or nothing. If the goal is not met everyone who has contributed will be refunded. However If the goal is met, about 21% of each bag's total cost will go towards Trans Women of Color Collective (TWOCC).</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>The Bag:</strong></p>
<p>For those not familiar with an ita bag, it is a bag that has a clear window to display a person's favorite things. Whether it's pins, charms, or other forms of art, you can display them creatively! <br/><br/>This design is a representation that while we are all individually unique, we all are under the same umbrella within the lgbtqa+ community. <br/><br/>Made of faux(vegan) leather, the outside features four d-rings that convert it from a backpack into a cross body, giving it versatility to match your mood. Two outer zipper compartments; the windowed area, and the main compartment for holding daily necessities. While the inside features a small zippered pouch and two open pouches you can put easy to lose items in that need safe keeping.</p>
<p><strong>Measurements:</strong></p>
<p>Bag dimensions: 6 (L) x 12(W) x 4.5 (H)<br/>Window Space:  9½ (L) x 4  ¼ (H)<br/>Backpack Straps: 19"" -35 ½""<br/>Crossbody Strap: 27"" - 52 ½</p>

Hi! It's nice to meet everyone! I'm Fish, the artist of LittleFishStickStudio. This is my first Indiegogo project I've ever created, so I'm excited to share it with everyone. This project, the Umbrella Ita Bag, has been in the works since June. 
It began with the desire to do more for our community. The goal is to not only be able to produce this trans pride ita bag, but to raise funds for the Trans Women Of Color Collective (TWOCC). This campaign however is a fixed one, so it's all or nothing. If the goal is not met everyone who has contributed will be refunded. However If the goal is met, about 21% of each bag's total cost will go towards Trans Women of Color Collective (TWOCC).

The Bag:
For those not familiar with an ita bag, it is a bag that has a clear window to display a person's favorite things. Whether it's pins, charms, or other forms of art, you can display them creatively! This design is a representation that while we are all individually unique, we all are under the same umbrella within the lgbtqa+ community. Made of faux(vegan) leather, the outside features four d-rings that convert it from a backpack into a cross body, giving it versatility to match your mood. Two outer zipper compartments; the windowed area, and the main compartment for holding daily necessities. While the inside features a small zippered pouch and two open pouches you can put easy to lose items in that need safe keeping.
Measurements:
Bag dimensions: 6 (L) x 12(W) x 4.5 (H)Window Space:  9½ (L) x 4  ¼ (H)Backpack Straps: 19"" -35 ½""Crossbody Strap: 27"" - 52 ½


 

    If the initial goal is met, there are 7 more pride bag variations to unlock!


Pricing
Everything is priced in USD.

1 Umbrella ita bag is $50
For every 2 bags, there is a $5 discount.(Ex: 2 Umbrella ita bags are $95 and 4 are $190)
Removable Inserts - $5

 **Once the campaign is over, the Indiegogo rates will discontinue.**

The front and back of the watch are covered by scratch-resistant sapphire glass, an absolute necessity in a pilot's watch of this calibre. The watch's movement is installed from the top, creating unparalleled stability. The crown is screwed into the watch at a slight angle, making the piece water resistant up to 10 ATM. The face of the watch also indicates the date, with juxtaposing white digits on a black background. The 316L stainless steel case is partly polished partly matt brushed. Minor details such as the delicate screws which hold together the case are testament to the craftsmanship that goes into each watch.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480656943/gm2aqbfb4mwmtv3rtntr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480656966/oacdwahgf5skxjleto5i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Because we're convinced that a lot of Backers want to give this watch as a Christmas present to a friend or beloved one, we created a PDF RSC Mustang Christmas Voucher.

He studied photography and graphic design at the Royal Academy of Antwerp, Belgium. He is also the founder of the exclusive Swiss made brand STEFFEN (WWW.STEFFEN.BE). Passionate about aviation and specifically military aircraft, he designed the unique RSC (Ronald Steffen Creations) collection, with the aura of these nostalgic times. The result is this unique watch collection, designed with an eye for detail. The back of the watch is engraved with a beautiful etching of the airplane and presented in an original RSC box.Ronald Steffen Co-founder and designer of the Mustang watch. PRODUCTIONThe term 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts' certainly applies to the RSC P-51 Mustang Pilot Watch. The 20 separate parts that make up this unique timepiece are manually assembled to create a perfect wrist watch. The P-51 Mustang Pilot Watch also features a solid screwed case back with notches. The front and back of the watch are covered by scratch-resistant sapphire glass, an absolute necessity in a pilot's watch of this calibre. The watch's movement is installed from the top, creating unparalleled stability. The crown is screwed into the watch at a slight angle, making the piece water resistant up to 10 ATM. The face of the watch also indicates the date, with juxtaposing white digits on a black background. The 316L stainless steel case is partly polished partly matt brushed. Minor details such as the delicate screws which hold together the case are testament to the craftsmanship that goes into each watch. Because we're convinced that a lot of Backers want to give this watch as a Christmas present to a friend or beloved one, we created a PDF RSC Mustang Christmas Voucher. The moment you receive our survey with your choice of watch (beginning of December), we will send you a PDF file that you can print,  you can put in a nice envelop and hand it over as a present. • SWISS MADE• Automatic ETA movement 2824-2• ± 38 hours power reserve• Stainless steel 316L case• Multi-layered dial• Strong luminescence• See through case back with sapphire crystal• Every watch has a unique number• Date indication: at 6 o’clock• Strong leather strap assortment• Water resistant 10 ATM (100m / 33 ft) with double gasket screw down crownCase sizes:diameter: 44 mm - diameter + crown: 54 mm - thickness: 14 mmStrap:strap + watch length: 280mm - strap width: 22mm - buckle width: 30mmTotal weight watch + leather strap: 128 g Swiss movement manufacturer ETA SA has been developing and producing calibres for the watch industry since 1793.Screwed down crown in order to obtain water resistance of 10 ATM. • SWISS MADE• ETA 2824-2 movement• 28.800 bph / 25 jewels / 42h power reserve   Swiss movement manufacturer ETA SA has been developing and producing calibres for the watch industry since 1793.Precision, reliability and level of performance are the key features of their products.        Sapphire glass is created by crystallizing corundum, or aluminium oxide, at temperatures of 4000° F and then by moulding the mixture into clear disks. These disks are then machined to the proper crystal size, polished, and perfectly fit to the watch case. In fact, it has a hardness of 9 on the Mohs scale that ranges from 1 to 10, and is surpassed in hardness only by diamond. The major advantages of sapphire and the drawbacks of mineral crystals are summed up in the table above. The dials are dual layered with cut-outs, that give much more 3D feeling than a normal dial.

<p>In
early 2012 I was in a battle with myself trying to fine other things that I
though God wanted me to do with my life other than being a Graphic designer,  I
was always praying to God what is it that he wanted me to do.   I been doing graphic
design work for so long I just wanted to do more for him it took a lot
of time to figure out what it was but I came up with a
idea that I thought I would enjoy doing it is “fashion” I love all new fashion
that comes out and new trends and I have always stayed up to date with the latest fashion
well I hope so..lol.   So I decided to do that but I didn't have a name for the clothing line and how would I
do the designs.  Well it took some time to come up with a name in between that time I was batting with a disease called
gout.  Gout is a
disease in which defective metabolism of uric acid causes arthritis, especially
in the smaller bones of the feet, deposition of chalk stones and episodes of
acute pain. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I was having all kinds of attack that left me not being able to

to the doctors because I was having issues with breathing so I went to the ER
and they took me back and ran all kinds of test on me and they told me that my oxygen
levels are very low so I had to stay in there til my oxygen levels came back up,  while I was in there I was just thinking
about the clothing line and how long it would take and how I was
going to get the money to even start other business with all my health
issues I was having there would be no way for me to do it.  As months pasted by and it felt like I was going
through hell and my life wasn't right at all,  one thing after another,  I was so stress out I didn’t know want God wanted
me to do at the time I just knew I was suppose to keep on praying no matter
what was going on and keep my faith at a high.  </span></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/785032/files/20140813061702-Blog-Man-kneeling-Cross-8053908.jpg?1407935822"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>THE MAKING OF I'M A KINGS KID:</b></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I kept hearing this voice that was

up out that stress mode and started to believe more in myself and more into the

issues I was having there would be no way for me to do it.  As months pasted by and it felt like I was going
through hell and my life wasn't right at all,  one thing after another,  I was so stress out I didn’t know want God wanted
me to do at the time I just knew I was suppose to keep on praying no matter
what was going on and keep my faith at a high.  THE MAKING OF I'M A KINGS KID:I kept hearing this voice that was
telling me “I will be your provider” and I remember reading in Psalm 21  After reading that it woke me up I started realizing that I’m
killing myself by stressing out about things and worrying about things so I got
up out that stress mode and started to believe more in myself and more into the
clothing line so I started coming up with ideas for the line,   I was up day and night and so focus trying to design the right type of design and BINGO there it
was the first design for the line I knew it was right because it felt
right.    After that I was praying for all the things I would need and praying for the money for the shirts I was going to start off with But the design’s I came up with where really hot but
it needed a few more things to add to them.  I got on the internet and looked up  ""well know bible verses""  with my girl and I picked just 4 bible verses, one for each color it was 4 colors for each design and it was 4 meaning at
the bottom of each design and there
you go the first designs for I’m A Kings Kid clothing and I called it “The
Takeoff Collection” because it was the first that I wanted to push out and I
had to speak life into it and I knew this was the will of God and I remember
the feeling,  it felt
so right and it felt like the thing to do and I remember reading in Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.  SEEING THE BLESSING FACE 2 FACE:So God started sending me blessings because he seen me moving and staying focus on this and he seen how I really wanted to make this happen.  So he blessed me with all the money I
would need to open my new business,  so my first order was 280 t-shirts God was moving so fast through me I didn't know how to stop.   So then I designed the website, business cards and flyers and got all the things that I
would need to start off the business.  So on June 15th
2013 I launch my first online website and online store for I'M A KINGS KID and that was the beginning and once I opening the doors God open his doors wide open.  I couldn't believe it on Sunday June 23rd 2013 Bishop T.D. Jake's went on twitter and twitted out a picture of him wearing the t-shirt that I designed and came up with I almost died,  it was so unbelievable to really see that,  I still shed a tear when I see it.   He was the first big name to support I’M A KINGS KID that was mega for me.  Bishop is someone I have always looked up too because of his teaching & preaching and how he has been around me for so long with the power of the internet and TV,  after that there where a gang of other celebs that embrace brand and so many other around the world embraced it as well.   That was
so big for me and after that God continue to open more doors and more doors and
more doors for me, it open my eyes to so
many different things and brand new ideas I want to do with I’M A KINGS KID.  He gave me so many gifts and I love it so much I just want to take this brand to that next level so my haters can hate on me even more...lol  God is Good.  BISHOP T.D. JAKES

</div></div>","Introducing the PetSafe® rufferee™ system, a total home solution that enables your pet to learn what is off limits and help you monitor his behavior.
FEATURED IN:







With rufferee you can count, timestamp and monitor any interactions between your pet and various objects throughout your home.




The system includes a collar and three flags that work together to communicate with your pet and you.  Simply put the collar on your pet and place the flags on items you want to monitor. 

Using the free app, you can sync the collar to your smart device and each flag can be assigned as avoidance or monitor per pet. Flags are useful all over the home!



rufferee will work with both cats and dogs and can be used with multiple pets in the same home. When
programming each flag you can even designate different settings for each pet.



rufferee enables you to set your mind at ease and allow you to feel more comfortable, enabling you to give your pet(s) more freedom even when you are not home. 




















The rufferee system is highly customizable, since you can program a single flag to have different settings for each pet. Monitor one dog's food dish visits and keep the other dog out of it. Keep your cat from scratching the couch while letting the dog lay on it. The system can be customized to work with all your pets and a variety of needs.





Collect stats on your pet's actions throughout the day by setting your flags to monitor mode. See how many times your pet visited each flag, what time he was there and how long he stayed.  Adjust the range to match the approximate size area you want to monitor.  For example, you can set the range of the flag to near for a small water bowl. 






Teach your pet when he is out of bounds by setting your flags to avoidance mode. Place a flag on the object you want your pet to avoid, and set the range for the flag to tell the system how close the pet should be before he receives a warning. You can choose between two correction settings: vibration or non-harming static correction.  No matter which setting you choose, there will be a warning tone preceding the vibration or correction.  





rufferee can be used in a variety of ways to fit your lifestyle. From furniture to rooms and tables, you can customize where to put the flags and how your pet(s) interact with them.  Want to monitor how often the cat is using the litterbox while also keeping the dog out of it? ONE rufferee flag can accomplish both.







You can also use it indoors or outdoors to:
Protect your plantsKeep pets off the stairsKeep them out of the pantryKnow if they're in the garageKnow if they use the dog doorKeep pets off your deskKeep pets out of a flower bedHave them stay away from the grillAnd many more


Use the rufferee app to program any number of collars and an unlimited number of flags for each pet. Each flag can even have different settings for each pet in your home.























Buying gates, an activity monitor and deterrents could cost you hundreds of dollars! rufferee is discrete, versatile and fully programmable enabling you and your pet(s) to be on the same team, for a fraction of the cost.

How many collars can I use at one time?You can use as many collars as you need.  

Are static correction products harmful to my pet?
Static correction has been proven safe and will not harm your pet. It is a very mild electric stimulation that does not cause harm. The correction is designed to gently get your pet’s attention or interrupt undesirable behavior but never to harm them. Most PetSafe® static training products start with a warning beep, which is enough to remind most pets of what they’ve learned. When trained correctly, they rarely experience the electric stimulation again.


rufferee uses a progressive stimulation, where the closer the pet gets to the flag, the stronger the correction.  The collar has a safety feature where it will automatically time out after 15 seconds. 


Can the static correction be turned off?
Yes, we know all pets are different.  That is why we give you two different ways to help you teach your pet, vibration or static correction. 

How will I know if the flag and collar are connected?
When programming the collar and flags for the first time, they flash to signify that the app has recognized them.  You can then view everything in the app including activity and battery level. 

What if the ranges are not enough?

Because the flags use Bluetooth LE, the placement and orientation of the flags can impact the range.  We suggest you start with the flag in a range that most closely resembles the area you would like to either monitor or avoid.  Then if the detection range of the flag is too large or too small, try altering the orientation of the flag. This will modify the direction that the antenna is facing which will impact your range.


Why is there no International Shipping?
Developing a new product in the USA has a significant amount of regulation and testing and to include international quality and regulation standards, this would potentially expand our timeline even further..  In order to make sure we can hit our timeline, we are unable to offer rufferee internationally.",45.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Who’s never
experienced this situation when pockets are unpleasantly over stuffed?</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>Too much for the
pockets, not enough for a backpack, you sometimes insist not to bother our
girlfriend and finally realize that huge holes appeared in our pockets (made of
textile increasingly fragile and cheap), you can see the shape of our phone on
jeans (which pockets are increasingly tight), the inside pockets of this super
expensive but nice jacket deformed by our wallet. Or worse, you forget THE thing
that should not be forgotten at this very moment, and have this argument with
your girlfriend, because you asked her to carry your stuff for the fifteenth
time...</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Back in 2008, I was
spending time at my family house in Ain, France and decided to go through the
attic before its renovation. As I was going up there, I was sure to find
amazing things, treasures from my grand-parents’ past. I wasn't disappointed
when I ran into the small leather satchel, a “Baise-en-ville” model that my
great grand-father used to transport his small medical equipment during the
1940s. He had given it to my grand-father, and it seemed that he left it there
for me to find one day. </p>
<p>The satchel has
survived all this time and its robust leather carries the marks of the past and
the story of my family. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/684365/files/20140630074003-_MG_0177.JPG?1404139203"" src="""" style=""""/><i style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">My
great-grandfather's satchel.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>It was not long
before I realized how useful the satchel was. Its small size made it really
practical to handle and carry everywhere. It came in handy when I started
wearing suits, jackets and more elegant clothes. The problem is that your
pockets and the fabric wear out and you quickly feel uncomfortable when you
have to fill up your pockets with your wallet, smartphone… </p>
<p>The satchel provided
me with an elegant and practical solution to this problem!</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/684431/files/20140630080439-_MG_0173.JPG?1404140679"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic; background-color: initial;""/><i style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">With the old satchel
that inspired us.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>As you may see, I
fell in love with my great grand-father’s “BEV”, its history, its simplicity
and its usefulness, and I wanted to keep on writing the story of the
satchel. </p>
<p>To my big surprise,
the “BEV” had totally disappeared from man fashion but does bring a solution to
a lot of a man’s issues when he wants to dress sharply and elegantly and still
needs to carry some things around. That’s why I decided to gather a small
team of young and willing entrepreneurs to help me share my discovery and this
little piece of history I found and create this brand : De Rigueur.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/688934/files/20140702022637-10469588_10204359202678930_1534604879_n.jpg?1404293197"" src="""" style=""""/><i style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">From

Rigueur, now the team has grown up, with Alexandra and another Adrien!</i></p>
</div>
<div>
<br/><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, we worked on
the design of the BEV, so that it would fit the everyday needs of the modern
man : carrying an iPad, with an adjustable leather strap and an inside pocket
to put your flat documents (ID, credit cards...).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/689406/files/20140702070401-10524392_10204360132342171_1701676133_n.jpg?1404309841"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic; background-color: initial;""/><i style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">Working on the
technical drawings of the BEV.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once we had a
precise idea of what we wanted, we went to meet many and many stakeholders of
the leather industry : cutting tools manufacturers, metallic parts sellers,
tanneries, leather skins providers, craftsmen (and of course bankers, insurers,
accountants...). That's when the story of De Rigueur really began. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/689415/files/20140702071114-10514904_10204360115381747_1954557966_n.jpg?1404310274"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic; background-color: initial;""/><i style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">Some of our leather

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/688940/files/20140702023513-3_why.jpg?1404293713"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>De Rigueur refers
directly to the French sentence: “Tenue de rigueur”, the necessary outfit according
to the situation you're experiencing. The idea is to make our bag your
everyday's best friend, carrying what you need the most and becoming essential
to your style. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/684547/files/20140630084242-55.jpg?1404142962"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic; background-color: initial;""/><i style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">Paul, walking along
the Seine.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is also a tribute
to our craftsmen’s meticulous work which is at the very heart of the brand.
Indeed this work requires riguor and time to get to a beautiful handcrafted
product. In fact, all craftmen we work with have a real experience in the
handmade leather industry, with years of work with prestige luxury houses, like
Hermès. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/684430/files/20140630080249-Ateleir_Forella.jpg?1404140569"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic; background-color: initial;""/><i style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">Jacqueline and her
daughter, Maud, our amazing craftswomen. They worked for Hermès for a while,
and are now following projects for various young companies like De
Rigueur. </i></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>De Rigueur also felt
appropriate considering the economic environment: we are a startup of the
crisis, born in a world where governments are implementing austerity policies,
or “politique de rigueur” in French, instead of encouraging people to create
companies and jobs. And we know what we are talking about … as we are French!!
So De Rigueur is our way to tell them “Whatever!”.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/688926/files/20140702022059-Shooting_De_Rigueur_HD_2.jpg?1404292859"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic; width: 304.6623093681917px; height: 460px; background-color: initial;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/688927/files/20140702022255-Shooting_De_Rigueur_HD_10.jpg?1404292975"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic; width: 303.6774891774892px; height: 457px; background-color: initial;""/><i style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">Paul's French Touch.</i></p></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, the good
thing with ""De Rigueur"", is that this word is fully understandable in
English too, and means the same thing, like ""Déjà vu"",
""fiancé"" ...</p>

<p></p>
<p>As of today, we are
crowdfunding 20 000€ in order to reach a sufficient amount of handcrafted
production to bargain costs with our suppliers and craftsmen, so that we would
be able to finance our e-commerce website, that we will launch during the
Official Launch of the brand in September in Paris.</p>
<p>People supporting us
through this campaign will be the first ones to ever receive these beautiful
items into which we put so much love and energy to bring them to life. We
worked on a variety of products in order to satisfy everyone wanting to help us
in the development of this project, but in case you can't afford to pledge
here, we will be reeeeeaally grateful if you could share this project in your
circles!</p>

<p></p>
<p>The BEV, or
""Baise-En-Ville"", is a very old model of small French satchels made
of leather used in the 30's to carry one's personal belongings, while spending
a night in the city before going back to the countryside.</p>
<p>Re-designed with
full grain calfskin leather coming from Toscana, Italy, this high quality
leather is vegetable re-tanned in an eco-friendly way, which allows it to get a
very nice patina, without losing its quality and color.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/689422/files/20140702071433-10528148_10204360056260269_1654902883_n.jpg?1404310473"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic; background-color: initial;""/><i style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">Our full-grain leather
is called ""Galaxy"".</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>What is full-grain
leather? A cow's skin is about 2cm thick. The tannery can split a hide as many
as four times, but all splits are not equal. The ""grain"" is the
top/skin side of the hide and is the best and strongest part of the hide.
Full-grain leather is the very top split that has not been sanded or resurfaced
to hide or remove color variation, scars or blemishes. These marks are signs of
the cow’s life and, as  far as I’m concerned, not real imperfections,
because they add character to a bag. But in my opinion the character of your
bag must mostly come from the way it is living by your side, getting this nice
patina that only time and life can create.</p>
<p>We then sourced the
metallic parts, which come from France, Italy, or Germany. They are conceived
to resist the daily use for years :</p>

worked with craftswomen near Lyon, France (at Colombier-Saugnieu and
Challes-les-Eaux if you are curious). See the picture of Jacqueline and Maud
above!</p>
<p>We made
them big enough to carry your things around but not too big so you won't feel
hoarded. The BEV is  260mm x 200mm x 60mm. This is big enough to put
your wallet, smartphone, keys, a book and even your iPad! Indeed it was
designed so your tablet could fit inside (iPad 2, Air, Retina, Mini). </p>

<p>The Early
Adopter price we offer for a BEV during the Indiegogo campaign is about €220.
However, when the campaign is over, it will be available at €250. In
comparison, the retailing price of our BEV in shop would be aroud €480 in shop.
And we don't kid you, that's the price they told you they would sell it, at
least!</p>

<p></p>
<p>The whole project is
a challenge in itself: high-end, leather, handmade, French, affordable… none of
those words rhyme probably because no one ever thought of putting them back to
back in one sentence… That’s our challenge: offering you high-end leather
accessories handmade in France, at an affordable price.</p>

<p>If we fail at
reaching our €20 000 goal, the main risks is that we are not going to be able

it takes around 5 hours to create a single BEV. But producing them in large
amount is a way for us to offer you the best quality for a decent price.</p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>The leather we use on
ALL of our products (BEV, iPad sleeves and iPhone cases) comes from Toscana,
Italy. It is a full grain calfskin leather with a vegetable re-tanning. </p>
<p>It is then sent to

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>We will try to send
you the products as soon as possible. We are taking the risk to start the
production in July, before the campaign is over to be able to send you the
items in August, when our craftsmen are on vacation. The products we were not
able to deliver in August will be sent in September 2014.</p>

<p><b>How will you ship
them?</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>Our products can be
shipped worldwide, in our De Rigueur box which has been especially designed to
ship our BEV and iPad sleeve.</p>
<p>In order to reduce
the shipping fees, our smaller items (iPhone case and USB key) will not be
shipped in the box but carefully wrapped in bubble wrap and packed to be safely

quality leather bags for men, iPad sleeves and iPhone cases. Handmade in France
to preserve the legacy of an industry known for the quality of its arts and
crafts.




Who’s never
experienced this situation when pockets are unpleasantly over stuffed?

Too much for the
pockets, not enough for a backpack, you sometimes insist not to bother our
girlfriend and finally realize that huge holes appeared in our pockets (made of
textile increasingly fragile and cheap), you can see the shape of our phone on
jeans (which pockets are increasingly tight), the inside pockets of this super
expensive but nice jacket deformed by our wallet. Or worse, you forget THE thing
that should not be forgotten at this very moment, and have this argument with
your girlfriend, because you asked her to carry your stuff for the fifteenth
time...


Paul,
our model during the shooting.




Back in 2008, I was
spending time at my family house in Ain, France and decided to go through the
attic before its renovation. As I was going up there, I was sure to find
amazing things, treasures from my grand-parents’ past. I wasn't disappointed
when I ran into the small leather satchel, a “Baise-en-ville” model that my
great grand-father used to transport his small medical equipment during the
1940s. He had given it to my grand-father, and it seemed that he left it there
for me to find one day. 
The satchel has
survived all this time and its robust leather carries the marks of the past and
the story of my family. 


My
great-grandfather's satchel.



It was not long
before I realized how useful the satchel was. Its small size made it really
practical to handle and carry everywhere. It came in handy when I started
wearing suits, jackets and more elegant clothes. The problem is that your
pockets and the fabric wear out and you quickly feel uncomfortable when you
have to fill up your pockets with your wallet, smartphone… 
The satchel provided
me with an elegant and practical solution to this problem!


With the old satchel
that inspired us.



As you may see, I
fell in love with my great grand-father’s “BEV”, its history, its simplicity
and its usefulness, and I wanted to keep on writing the story of the
satchel. 
To my big surprise,
the “BEV” had totally disappeared from man fashion but does bring a solution to
a lot of a man’s issues when he wants to dress sharply and elegantly and still
needs to carry some things around. That’s why I decided to gather a small
team of young and willing entrepreneurs to help me share my discovery and this
little piece of history I found and create this brand : De Rigueur.


From
left to right : Jérôme, Manon, and me (Adrien), the founding team of De
Rigueur, now the team has grown up, with Alexandra and another Adrien!




Then, we worked on
the design of the BEV, so that it would fit the everyday needs of the modern
man : carrying an iPad, with an adjustable leather strap and an inside pocket
to put your flat documents (ID, credit cards...).
Working on the
technical drawings of the BEV.



Once we had a
precise idea of what we wanted, we went to meet many and many stakeholders of
the leather industry : cutting tools manufacturers, metallic parts sellers,
tanneries, leather skins providers, craftsmen (and of course bankers, insurers,
accountants...). That's when the story of De Rigueur really began. 
Some of our leather
cutting tools.




De Rigueur refers
directly to the French sentence: “Tenue de rigueur”, the necessary outfit according
to the situation you're experiencing. The idea is to make our bag your
everyday's best friend, carrying what you need the most and becoming essential
to your style. 
Paul, walking along
the Seine.



It is also a tribute
to our craftsmen’s meticulous work which is at the very heart of the brand.
Indeed this work requires riguor and time to get to a beautiful handcrafted
product. In fact, all craftmen we work with have a real experience in the
handmade leather industry, with years of work with prestige luxury houses, like
Hermès. 

Jacqueline and her
daughter, Maud, our amazing craftswomen. They worked for Hermès for a while,
and are now following projects for various young companies like De
Rigueur. 



De Rigueur also felt
appropriate considering the economic environment: we are a startup of the
crisis, born in a world where governments are implementing austerity policies,
or “politique de rigueur” in French, instead of encouraging people to create
companies and jobs. And we know what we are talking about … as we are French!!
So De Rigueur is our way to tell them “Whatever!”.
Paul's French Touch.

Finally, the good
thing with ""De Rigueur"", is that this word is fully understandable in
English too, and means the same thing, like ""Déjà vu"",
""fiancé"" ...
The first BEV ever
made.



We have been living
this project 1 000% for 10 months now, travelling across France to find the
best craftsmen, and Italy for the best materials, and are really, really happy,
to show you our very first collection !
The BEV enjoying the
sun at the sea.

As of today, we are
crowdfunding 20 000€ in order to reach a sufficient amount of handcrafted
production to bargain costs with our suppliers and craftsmen, so that we would
be able to finance our e-commerce website, that we will launch during the
Official Launch of the brand in September in Paris.
People supporting us
through this campaign will be the first ones to ever receive these beautiful
items into which we put so much love and energy to bring them to life. We
worked on a variety of products in order to satisfy everyone wanting to help us
in the development of this project, but in case you can't afford to pledge
here, we will be reeeeeaally grateful if you could share this project in your
circles!





Now, discover our
collection!




The BEV:

The BEV, or
""Baise-En-Ville"", is a very old model of small French satchels made
of leather used in the 30's to carry one's personal belongings, while spending
a night in the city before going back to the countryside.
Re-designed with
full grain calfskin leather coming from Toscana, Italy, this high quality
leather is vegetable re-tanned in an eco-friendly way, which allows it to get a
very nice patina, without losing its quality and color.

Our full-grain leather
is called ""Galaxy"".



What is full-grain
leather? A cow's skin is about 2cm thick. The tannery can split a hide as many
as four times, but all splits are not equal. The ""grain"" is the
top/skin side of the hide and is the best and strongest part of the hide.
Full-grain leather is the very top split that has not been sanded or resurfaced
to hide or remove color variation, scars or blemishes. These marks are signs of
the cow’s life and, as  far as I’m concerned, not real imperfections,
because they add character to a bag. But in my opinion the character of your
bag must mostly come from the way it is living by your side, getting this nice
patina that only time and life can create.
We then sourced the
metallic parts, which come from France, Italy, or Germany. They are conceived
to resist the daily use for years :

The 2 metallic
fasteners called ""tuck"".
The buckle of our
adjustable leather strap.


The lining
is a high quality fabric (called suedin), which matches the color of the bag.
Moreover, an inside pocket will allow you to quickly find your flat documents
(ID, credit card, parking ticket,...).



Finally, we
worked with craftswomen near Lyon, France (at Colombier-Saugnieu and
Challes-les-Eaux if you are curious). See the picture of Jacqueline and Maud
above!
We made
them big enough to carry your things around but not too big so you won't feel
hoarded. The BEV is  260mm x 200mm x 60mm. This is big enough to put
your wallet, smartphone, keys, a book and even your iPad! Indeed it was
designed so your tablet could fit inside (iPad 2, Air, Retina, Mini). 
Our four models :



The Early
Adopter price we offer for a BEV during the Indiegogo campaign is about €220.
However, when the campaign is over, it will be available at €250. In
comparison, the retailing price of our BEV in shop would be aroud €480 in shop.
And we don't kid you, that's the price they told you they would sell it, at
least!

brand's DNA, but it's not the only items we want to offer you. 

Freedom is one of our main values.

by our BEV's design, we wanted it simple but beautiful, elegant &

the same suedin as the BEV to perfectly protect your iPad from scratches and
dust.

Our BEVs fighting to
know who's the man!








The whole project is
a challenge in itself: high-end, leather, handmade, French, affordable… none of
those words rhyme probably because no one ever thought of putting them back to
back in one sentence… That’s our challenge: offering you high-end leather
accessories handmade in France, at an affordable price.

Our BEV comes in his
nice blue packaging.



If we fail at
reaching our €20 000 goal, the main risks is that we are not going to be able
to produce enough items to reduce our costs. Producing our bags is expensive as
it takes around 5 hours to create a single BEV. But producing them in large
amount is a way for us to offer you the best quality for a decent price.
You would surely
enjoy having your BEV at the beach!




Where do you get the
leather from?

The leather we use on
ALL of our products (BEV, iPad sleeves and iPhone cases) comes from Toscana,
Italy. It is a full grain calfskin leather with a vegetable re-tanning. 
It is then sent to
our manufacturers in France who work with this great material to make our
products.


When am I likely to
get it?

We will try to send
you the products as soon as possible. We are taking the risk to start the
production in July, before the campaign is over to be able to send you the
items in August, when our craftsmen are on vacation. The products we were not
able to deliver in August will be sent in September 2014.


How will you ship
them?

Our products can be
shipped worldwide, in our De Rigueur box which has been especially designed to
ship our BEV and iPad sleeve.
In order to reduce
the shipping fees, our smaller items (iPhone case and USB key) will not be
shipped in the box but carefully wrapped in bubble wrap and packed to be safely
delivered to your home.





How can I choose the
color I want?

We will contact you
via E-mail to ask you what color you want. Please let us contact you first, it
will be easier for us to collect and deliver your order.


Why is the BEV shown
with and without a strap in your photos?

As you may have seen
on the pictures, the BEV comes with a leather strap: it is detachable so that
you can carry it over your shoulder or simply choose to use the handle.





Thanks for
taking the time to check out our campaign! We'd hugely appreciate you sharing
it with your friends!

Rigueur's team.

</div>","Coen Anders is founded upon a love for fashion and an appreciation for life's unexpected adventures. Led by a keen eye on runway trends and contemporary lifestyle, each piece is created to complement any outfit or occasion seamlessly so that your look can truly be complete. 








COEN ANDERS… HERE’S WHY:

We know that watches have become more than just a way to tell time.
To some, they may be iconic accessories that define your personality; to most, they're companions that take you through your day with style.






From conceptualization to creation, we take inspiration from what's current in fashion and lifestyle so that our collections are stylishly executed with versatility and quality. This fresh approach has changed how watches are routinely designed – by considering these perspectives first, our design process is engineered by how you lead your life and how Coen Anders can pair with it. After all, fashion tells a story… and we want it to be your story.









 • Led by Fashion, Followed by Design• 4 Dial & Case Options: White (Rose Gold), White (Silver), Black (Rose Gold), Black (Silver)• 9 Interchangeable Straps: Calf Leather, Suede Leather, and Nylon NATO


Inspired by contemporary fashion, clean lines, and the natural colour palettes that surround us, we designed beautiful combinations to accentuate these moments in time. With an array of straps to choose from, Coen Anders is perfect for everyday use, with options for you to switch up your looks.
Choose Your Moment – A Coen Anders for any outfit, any occasion.

Coffee date with an old friend, Summer days by the beach,Weekend picnics in the park, Swanky Friday night wine & dine.






Our watches have been thoughtfully conceptualised based on elements and principles that are integral in design. By carefully considering what makes things visually appealing, Coen Anders watches are effortlessly chic and timeless.

​ProportionJust like how the right silhouette can turn you from drab to fab, your watch should flatter your wrist as well. Designed for both men and women, Coen Anders watches are assembled with cohesive components for a streamlined appearance that hugs your wrist naturally.TextureSuit up with leather, or party on with NATO – different straps were created to pair with different outfits harmoniously. Coen Anders is offered in varied options of 2 leather straps, 2 suede straps, and 5 NATO straps. Soft and durable, all of these look great and feel great on your wrist.







• Curvature of the watch case
Through meticulous research and prototyping, we’ve fine-tuned the curvature of the watch case so that it appears thinner and sleeker, while retaining optimal fit and comfort for everyday wear.• Curvature of the lugsWith angled lugs to provide a better fit to most wrists, Coen Anders watches fit comfortably with better alignment.

• Chronograph movement with refined hands and indicesThrough key layering on the dial, we’ve managed to strike a minimalist feel while having distinctive features, giving Coen Anders a unique identity that is distinguishable from other pieces on the market.• Dome glassUsing bespoke tapered edges and a blend of right angles, the smooth dome glass is scratch-resistant, while lending greater visibility with a sleek finish. 













Risks & Challenges

Coen Anders has gone through meticulous research, design, and prototyping, and we are now ready to share our watches with you.

The project could face possible challenges if the quality of the product does not meet our requirements after production; however, with our extensive experience and close relationship with our manufacturer, we will work with them to ensure that production goes smoothly. We aim to streamline the process and deliver our beautiful watches to you before the expected delivery dates.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Monique Siders (Nubia Sunshine) 41, Brooklyn NY, Reiki Practitioner, Life Coach, Fashion Designer, Stylist and Owner of KUSH Design. In designing I love creating garments that are uniquely designed to fit the customers personality and inner essence. Like taking the inner being and wearing their true self on the outside to share with the world. In my Reiki Healing practices, I learn and understand how to use universal love energy to heal the bodies mind. loving who the YOU, we BE</p>
<p>I began my career working as a Designer and a stylist in 1995. I was working for a small company Audrey Smaltz and the Ground Crew as a stylist for the Mercedes Benz Fashion week as well as for many well-known designers. For 7 years I styled for the industries top designers, making me a well-known fixture in mainstream top fashion brands. In 1998 I decided it was time for me to take my creative abilities and begin my own clothing line.</p>
<p> In 2001 I returned back to school to obtain a degree in fashion design, which I achieved in 2003. Since then I continued to freelance design, for many small companies in the fashion industry. I worked in all categories ranging from Childrenswear, Juniors, Missy, Lingerie, Young Mens , Mens and Big &amp; tall.  In 2006 I began working full time with Sean John as a technical designer. This is where I learned core principles in Production, sourcing, patternmaking and quality control. I began to quickly learn the core components of working for a large name design company with all the details needed to grow a strong quality brand.  </p>
<p>I continue to work full time freelancing for companies as I build a budget and brand recognition for KUSH designs. KUSH designs is currently incorporated as a LLC (legal liability corporation), but is in the stages of re-developing. I have partnered with Pharaonic Designs another company I co-own, more established as a brand, to set up a re-launch of KUSH designs. There are no set day-to-day operations as I am still working to re-create the brand. Currently I am the primary investor with gifts and donations given from  friends, private organizations, and family.</p>

We sell our handmade shoes in limited runs and carefully select each textile we use. Over half of the fabrics used in our first order are handwoven and sourced from weaving collectives around the world.</p><p>We believe in fair trade and supporting communities by promoting their local skills and traditions. By supporting this Kickstarter campaign, you will play a vital role in bringing Patara to life. We want to support the craftsmen who make our shoes and the weavers who make our fabric.</p><p>The money raised here will ensure that they are paid a fair wage and allow us to fund our first order and get them to San Diego. We understand that waste comes along with production. This is why we are committed to the use of as many sustainable materials as possible. Our shoes are made with organic cotton fibers, jute outsole bumpers, and insoles which are lined with a natural cork layer ensuring breathability in the warmest of climates.</p><p>We believe that many of life’s most valuable experiences are gained through travel. While exploring the globe, we have met some amazing people, discovered surreal landscapes, and most importantly, we have grown from these experiences. Often our most memorable and unexpected moments would happen while in the pursuit of another destination. As our buddy J.R.R Tolkien said:</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>“Not all those who wander are lost”</i></p><p>Patara doesn't directly translate into English, but roughly means auspicious or good fortune in Thai.

We sell our handmade shoes in limited runs and carefully select each textile we use. Over half of the fabrics used in our first order are handwoven and sourced from weaving collectives around the world.We believe in fair trade and supporting communities by promoting their local skills and traditions. By supporting this Kickstarter campaign, you will play a vital role in bringing Patara to life. We want to support the craftsmen who make our shoes and the weavers who make our fabric.The money raised here will ensure that they are paid a fair wage and allow us to fund our first order and get them to San Diego. We understand that waste comes along with production. This is why we are committed to the use of as many sustainable materials as possible. Our shoes are made with organic cotton fibers, jute outsole bumpers, and insoles which are lined with a natural cork layer ensuring breathability in the warmest of climates.We believe that many of life’s most valuable experiences are gained through travel. While exploring the globe, we have met some amazing people, discovered surreal landscapes, and most importantly, we have grown from these experiences. Often our most memorable and unexpected moments would happen while in the pursuit of another destination. As our buddy J.R.R Tolkien said:“Not all those who wander are lost”Patara doesn't directly translate into English, but roughly means auspicious or good fortune in Thai. Something we at Patara wish for everyone while traveling or in their everyday life.  Thanks for the support and wander on!Navy Mineral Wash Patara T-ShirtMen's Sizes XS – XXL20oz Mizu V6 Insulated Stainless Steel BottleKeeps drinks cold for 24 hours and hot for 12 hours   Risks and challengesFootwear production involves a lot of moving parts before we get a finished product.

</div><p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Sam and Dave are the
long-time friends who are behind Palm Shades. We met while doing volunteer work
in sunny Florida back in 2003, and developed a love for all things sunny and
warm! We started a business in 2008 and learned a lot of necessary lessons about
how we work together and about business in general. Sam has been in charge of
purchasing for a major corporation for the last few years and Dave has been an
owner in a few start-ups. All these experiences have lead us to walk down the
entrepreneur path together again. </p>
<p>We are very excited to
take our love of adventure and the outdoors and tie the Palm Shades brand into
that lifestyle. We have found the best quality sunglasses made with natural bamboo,
polarized lenses, great UV protection, and made sure it could fit Dave's big
head (and other big heads) using flexible arms. We want to share this product
with everyone!</p>
<p>We are looking to
raise money to purchase materials in bulk as we need to meet minimum order
quantities to get Palm Shades off the ground.  We also would like to purchase
enough inventory to cover the INDIEGOGO orders and have inventory left over for
the continuation of our business through our website and other online outlets.</p>
<p>We have passion for
providing a great looking product at an affordable price.  By purchasing
in bulk we keep our costs down and ensure that we can offer our sunglasses at a
lower price than most, if not all, of our competitors.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We have set a goal to
raise $7,000 during this campaign.  This
is the calculated amount that we need to cover the cost of minimum order
quantities of raw materials, freight, production, fulfillment, and have some
inventory left over to continue doing business through our website:
palmshadesco.com.</p>
<p>We have surveyed the
public and we are excited to offer the crowd favorites during this campaign as
perks: <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The AllNatural with its clean and unique look of all bamboo frames and t</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">he BlueSurf with the perfect contrast of bamboo arms and blue frames.  All of our styles include polarized lenses as
well.  We are also offering Palm Shades
branded hats and wooden carrying boxes as perks during this campaign. </span></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We have the details
worked out on the fulfillment piece of this project.  The only risk we see
in that area is if the production ends up being longer than we expect
or have conservatively planned for.  We have planned a buffer into our
fulfillment schedule in case we run into this problem, but we are confident
this will not be an issue.  Our plan is
to deliver to backers by the end of April/beginning of May.  </p>
<p>Another risk we face
has to do with minimum order quantities.  We have certain minimum order
quantities that we have to meet for each of our styles.  We are
structuring this project so that as long as we meet our fundraising goal we will cover the cost of the MOQ's.</p>

like to help us out, but cannot contribute financially at this time here are a

Nevertheless they make the case for a fair price.</p><p>A watchmaker colleague and myself will assemble the watches in this German workshop. That allows for an important benefit: I will be on top of the assembly process all the time, so there is continuous in-line Quality Assurance and speedy response to aberrations. In my humble opinion better than doing postproduction Quality Control on finished watches with the risk of having to rework faulty ones from scratch.</p><p>In the end I think I made it happen: a beautiful European built quality watch with a fair price tag.

That allows for an important benefit: I will be on top of the assembly process all the time, so there is continuous in-line Quality Assurance and speedy response to aberrations. In my humble opinion better than doing postproduction Quality Control on finished watches with the risk of having to rework faulty ones from scratch.In the end I think I made it happen: a beautiful European built quality watch with a fair price tag. By backing my project you will help me to fulfill my dream of creating and sharing my watch. For that gesture I will be very grateful.Perks
The limited series of The Porthole comes in one execution. The colors and materials are pretty well balanced and match the nautical theme wonderfully. Just as I envisioned it. Or... check the stretch goals.The limited edition watches will be numbered ""Ixxx of I300"" to show their Indiegogo origin. If we don't reach 300, then the actual number of pledges will determine the limited series length. After that the watches will be numbered sequentially.You will have a choice of 2 straps: brown leather or black silicone. You can let me know your selection during a survey after the project has been successfully funded.The shadowing effect of the luminova on the back of the hands is less strong on a glossy dial. Although the glossy finish resembles the sea surface as intended, a pearl finish will scatter the light better. You can choose your glossy or pearl finish for the dial in the post-campaign survey.Stretch target #1:I designed a custom made pin-buckle for the strap. The buckle echoes the shape of the lugs to form a perfect match with the watch. The standard pin-buckle is swapped with this buckle when we reach € 60,000.Stretch target #2:I will include a folding buckle with every watch when we reach € 120,000.Stretch target #3:I will include both straps with every watch when we reach € 180,000.Stretch target #4:reaching € 240,000 will open up a range of alternative materials and colors. I will offer the case in polished steel, the lugs in bronze and a green dial in both finishes. I might even offer a full brass version (case, lugs, dial, hands, markers). You will be offered a choice of metals and dial color in the post-campaign survey. Any combination is possible.Your watch has a warranty of 1 year starting on the first day of the month following the month of shipment. After that you can have your watch serviced at your local watchmaker. Spare parts will be available of course.Your pledge goes a long way on Indiegogo. Like any entrepreneur I would like to see my watches on the shelves of shops one day. By then the price will have tripled easily. Distribution channels and shops will take their share in revenue. So this is your chance to be among the first owners of a great watch for an affordable offer.N.B. for EU residents only: I have to pay your VAT for you. Your VAT is included in the shipping cost as a single amount when you pledge. So don't be startled when you see the shipping cost: it is € 12 shipping + 21% VAT.
Schedule
Right after the campaign I will order all parts. It will take anywhere between 3 and 5 month for these orders to fulfill. Most parts will take not much longer than 3 months, but the movements will take up to 4. And we need to account for summer closure of factories. As soon as parts arrive, we will check their quality, so we can act as soon as possible when necessary.We will start by mounting the glasses, which can be done before the movements arrive, gaining some time. We will also start shipping out the first watches made as soon as possible. We don’t have to wait to send you your perks until all watches are assembled.We will explore the possibility of having the parts shipped to us in a series of smaller batches. This will enable us to start assembling the watches earlier. There is room for a bit of slack, but we should all be realistic about unforeseen delays. We will do our best to ship your perk on time for the Gift season.Press kitYou can find a press kit here.Risks & Challenges
The greatest risk is for me to die during production ;-). I will see to proper contingency, so the project will generate and ship your perks with or without me.To build the prototype we had to make all of the parts, of course. Some turned out to be straightforward, some challenged even my well known and experienced suppliers, because it turned out some of my wishes were a first to them. In the end the devil has been driven out of every detail, so their is no longer any risk to encounter unforeseen construction challenges or unexpected production technique side effects.The limited series will be made first and the production schedule is based on the maximum lead-time of all suppliers and a bit to produce a total of 300 watches. Apart from acts of God, there is limited risk for delay.When the campaign is really successful, the delivery of the unlimited series of watches is based on available production capacity. No use to speculate before the end of the campaign.Everyone is ready and committed. Recently I checked lead-times and prices with my suppliers again to be sure. The production schedule is up-to-date and the pledge amounts optimized to the latest information.And then there are the Updates to keep you informed about any developments, good and bad. No risk that I will not inform you in time.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

HOW TO TRANSFORM THE MARI TOTE
  With an eye for high quality, all the leather we use is carefully selected and sourced from Italy and Spain. THE NORA BACKPACKWe only partner with manufacturers that maintain a high level of craftsmanship and subscribe to ethical practices.Over the last 2 years we’ve met with factories in different countries, including the US, South Korea and Vietnam, and tested to compare which is the right fit for our products. We decided on a manufacturer in Vietnam who produces high quality leather handbags for European and US brands.   Since leather is natural product, there are some parts that aren’t normally usable due to its irregular shape. The industry standard wastage of leather ranges from 20% - 50%, depending on the size of the leather piece.We tried to find a solution to this wasteful practice, and came up with an idea to make use of the scraps. After cutting the leather, all scrap pieces from the bags are gathered and reused to create the pouches. THE CLOUD POUCH IS MADE OF SCRAP LEATHER PIECES FROM THE CLOUD BAG THE CLOUD CROSSBODY BAG       COLOR: OCEAN BLUE COLOR: BLACK COLOR: LIGHT GREY THE REI - SHOULDER BAG VERSION THE REI - MESSENGER BAG VERSION​ COLOR: TAN  - The Rei bag transforms from a stylish shoulder bag to a messenger bag by simply closing zippers on the front and the back side.

</div>","The O-Rings, a toy for every kid!

At Increment we make toys for all kids, regardless of age or ability.
Our first toy is the O-Rings: sensory learning playthings that foster developmental skills. We need your help to bring them to market.



All kids learn through play, absorbing information through their senses. When they climb, build, push, pull, throw they are gaining the problem solving skills and interpersonal skills that we adults use in daily life.

Kids lose themselves in imaginative play, when they are engaging with new things and exploring the world around them ­ they are learning, but to them it is simply playing. Our toys foster open-ended play to build creativity in all kids.

Who We Are:
We are Maeve And Cynthia, Industrial Designers and Co-Founders of Increment. We met at Rhode Island School of Design and bonded over our shared interests in collaboration, accessibility, education, health, and play. We decided to form Increment after graduation,­ so we could make our projects a reality.
We believe that to create successful toys, you must play through your work, so that's what we do.


The Process:
We began designing accessible toys together in our senior at RISD. After working together for a semester, we decided to collaborate on our degree project to delve into the world of inclusive learning.



O-Rings Concept
Physical prototypes allow us to physically communicate the details of our concepts to the specialists we work with
Human Centered Design

As designers, we focus on creating products that are responsive to our users needs through research and collaboration. 
We worked with educators, specialists, parents, and kids, to understand what unmet needs existed for children both in play and development. We discovered that many toys and tools have to be adapted to be used by a child with disabilities, and saw an opportunity to create a product that could fulfill many roles in many environments. 



Along the way, we met Megan, who became our inspiration. Megan is blind and has other impairments including low muscle control, which severely affects her balance. Her parents told us that she didn’t like many toys and her teachers said that it was difficult to find toys that Megan could use with her friends. They challenged us to create a good looking toy that could be used at home, in school, and in therapy by any kid, regardless of ability, and the O-Rings came to life! 



Join us in making the toy industry more accessible, more social, and more creative!



Next Steps:


We have two other toys in development, but we need your help to launch our first product in what we want to build as an entire line of inclusive playthings.
Our goal of $30,000 will go straight to producing the first 150 sets of O-Rings.
It is important that our toys be safe and durable. The O-Rings are made with high-quality, certified non-toxic materials that are safe for use in schools. They are also manufactured in the U.S. This is why the price per set is so high, they are built to last. 


What Will Change:The textures and colors might change slightly, but they will remain high-quality materials and the same basic textures.

Our pattern has changed, and every seam with be double-stitched to be more uniform and prevent any spilled liquids or moisture into the interior.



Partnered With:
We have partnered up with The Grommet, a product launch platform, for an exclusive launch of the O-Rings in their online marketplace once our toys are in production.




International Shipping:
Right now, we can only ship the O-Rings within the U.S. If you are outside of the U.S., and want to pre-order a set, send us an email and we will be in touch and create a customized option for you. The two smallest options are available for international shipping (add $5.95). You can also choose to donate a set, or collaborate with us in creating our next product.

<p><strong><i>Why run an Indiegogo campaign for T-shirts - why not do a bulk print and sell them individually?</i></strong></p>
<p>Consumer clothing produces an incredible amount of waste, some of which ends up in our oceans. The global average consumption of textiles is around 13kg per person, per year. Along the production chain there can be negative effects from agricultural practices, emissions of chemicals and plastic micro-fibres, and poor working conditions in factories. It sounds unthinkable, but a large portion of the budget fashion produced every year never ends up being worn before it enters landfill.</p>

Illustrator Jo Brown produces incredible artworks that showcase animal life from around the world. We have been following Jo Brown's artworks since we came across her unique style of drawings several years ago. Recently we reached out to Jo with the idea of producing new artworks based on underwater photographs of our favourite ocean animals from around the world.

Jo has created some incredible concept pieces that we are hoping to print in a limited production of 25 t-shirts through this campaign. If successful, we will continue to work with Jo to think up and release new designs. 


Lets share Jo's artwork with the world and show people our passion for marine life whilst we're at it. Art isn't only to be admired on gallery walls - why not wear beautiful art on a hand printed, eco-friendly T-shirt!
How are the shirts eco friendly?
We've found a supplier of organic cotton T-shirts (free of plastic micro-fibres) produced using responsible social practices and renewable energy. The 'Earth Positive' T-shirts will be hand screen printed in Bristol, UK and shipped directly to you using as little plastic packaging as we can. 
How do I make sure that  I get the right size and colour?
At the end of the campaign we'll send you a survey asking for which cut (M/F), colour and size combination you would like. We will then send them out
Why run an Indiegogo campaign for T-shirts - why not do a bulk print and sell them individually?

We want to ensure that any T-shirts we get made have as positive an impact on the people and environment as possible. For this to work, we need them all to go on to a happy new owner, with none left unworn or discarded as 'fashion waste'. When they can be worn no longer we hope they can be donated, mended, up-cycled, or composted rather than discarded into landfill. This campaign can help us make this happen - and if you've read this and become a supporter, it's already working!

Where will our money go?
Most of the funding will go towards actually purchasing and printing the T-shirts, since this is a minimum run. About 30% of each shirt sale will go towards collaborating on the next set of commissioned artworks with Jo Brown.
If we exceed our initial goal of funding 25 shirts, the cost of printing begins to decrease.

But, they were responsible for starting a tradition.  We have not sought to improve it.  We have merely used their design elements.With the rapid expansion of the British Army in 1939, the MoD ordered military watches from various Swiss manufacturers.  The design of this, the ATP watch, was simply a 32mm metal cased white dial watch, with a railroad track minute marker chapter ring, very legible numbers, syringe hands, a sub seconds dial at 6 o'clock, and fixed bars.The manufacturers produced 20 similar designs which they believed met the MoD requirements.  Shown below, on A.F.0210.® straps are 4 of the 20 ATP designs by  Reconvilier, Lemania, Ebel and Enicar, most with a sterile dial, clockwise from top left.The various ATP watches on A.F.0210®. straps can be seen at :http://af0210strap.com/index.php/the-atp-watch-on-an-a-f-0210-strap/We have taken these manufacturers design themes and have emulated the design in a 36mm diameter stainless steel cased watch; our white, everyday, ATP A.F.0210. watch.     This has a sterile dial. It is shown middle below with 3 ATP watches, and a US military A-11 watch of the same era.  We could have pitched the A.F.0210. watch as a reinterpretation of the classic ATP watch, restyled using state of the art materials, updated with a modern movement from a leading Swiss watch movement maker, making a watch with low maintenance and giving it exceptional reliability, resulting in a truly timeless watch.     But, it is actually an affordable ATP type watch with a Japanese quartz movement, that will be comfortable to wear, will not cause despair if damaged, and will reliably tell you the time when you use it.The Generals got together again in 1944 and revised the ATP design.They could not do much better than reinforce the tradition they had started.   But, based on 4 years if experience, the white dial had proved to be unsatisfactory, and the watch was also a little small.So, they increased the diameter to 36mm, and made the dial black, incorporated both the manufacturers signature and a pheon on the dial, thus creating the WWW watch - Watch, Wrist, Waterproof.   12 manufacturers produced WWW watches in 1945 which they believed met the MoD requirements.  The hands and the sub seconds dials varied a little more in style than did the ATP designs.   The four example WWW watches below are signed, with a pheon, and are on A.F.0210.® straps.  The complete set of watches on A.F.0210.® straps can be seen at : https://thespringbar.com/blogs/guides/what-does-one-of-the-dirty-dozen-look-like-on-an-a-f-0210-strapWe have taken WWW watch design elements and have emulated the design in a 36mm diameter stainless steel cased watch, as our black, everyday, WWW A.F.0210. watch.     This is shown below in a gun metal case, but the production model will be polished silver.This is not an over the top campaign, pretending to reinvent the military watch as a modern interpretation with classical features.  This is a WWW type watch, a pleasure to wear on the comfortable A.F.0210.® strap, that will tell you the time when you use it daily. 


 

The Strap
This was also designed by the generals as a jungle warfare strap in late 1944.The strap is the AF0210®, a faithful remanufacture of the WW2 strap, which fits any wrist.  The strap is not hand tooled calf leather from an Italian workshop, but merely an authentic reproduction of a WW2 strap in cotton. The original strap complements the WW2 watches, and is very comfortable to wear. The strap length can be 250mm as was the original WW2 watch strap, or a 270mm long strap.    The Specification 
Timeline As you can see from the video below, we have the strap in production, and are at prototype stage with both the white ATP A.F.0210. watch, and the black WWW A.F.0210. watch.

 
We will convert to production in our crowdfunding as we progress. Packaging This watch does not come in a custom wooden crate, or a specially made tin box with dog tags.We simply ship it in the oil paper package as used in 1945, with the later NATO type numbering.    FundingWe have funded the prototype watch production, and already have a history of producing and selling the A.F.0210.® strap.The feedback from the A.F.0210.® strap supporters, has resulted in the A.F.0210. watch prototypes, and this campaign.We need your commitment as a crowd funding supporter to determine your dial colour preference, and our initial level of production. Risks and challengesWe know from our strap production experience that creating and delivering a product is a complicated process and often comes with unexpected hiccups.Just like the generals from 1939 onwards, we are prepared and can react to any situation.We will provide regular updates and photographs as often as possible, for example when the watch cases are finished, when the dials are printed, and during final assembly.TaxesThe watches will be shipped as a tracked package to your nominated address.You will be responsible for any customs duties and taxes.",14.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>The six of us pictured below (plus one more) have devoted our scarce cash resources since 2005 to successfully proving that our patented technology can enable <em>any</em> diesel engine to run on clean, safe, powerful and inexpensive 100% straight vegetable oil fuel.  That’s right – like the stuff you buy at the grocery store or that comes off a restaurant fryer!</p>
<p>The last step to this beneficial fuel’s going nationwide is a specialized, improved Filling Station, one that your support will allow us to build.  Then, we can replicate it around the country!</p>
<p>100% straight vegetable oil fuel is a true alternative to petroleum diesel that can play a significant role in alleviating global warming.  Our operation is lean because we are doing everything possible to help this fuel gain wide acceptance.  (Only three of the six of us are drawing even minimal wages.).</p>
<p>We are humbled and honored that you consider supporting our construction of an improved Filling Station for 100% vegetable oil fuel at our home in Albuquerque!  Any funding beyond this goal will enable us to build additional Stations.  If you will kindly fill out our online questionnaire to let us know where your funding is coming from, we can prioritize new Filling Stations to suit your geographic location!  Our updates will keep you posted!<strong> <br/></strong></p>

<p>How long do you think this <em>jatropha</em> seed will burn for?  When you watch this video, you may gain an appreciation for the viability of 100% plant oil fuel!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong>The Need for Funding to Build an Improved Filling Station</strong></h3>
<p>Our existing, prototype Filling Station pictured in the video above consists of a hodge-podge of components made for petroleum diesel.  In 2012, it gained the State of New Mexico's approval as being accurate for general, commercial use.</p>
<p>However, since vegetable oil has a higher viscosity, or thickness, than petroleum diesel, and it must remain warm to be fluid, we need to make adaptations if we are to be able to replicate this across the country:</p>
<p>- modify the nozzle and the fuel filtering mechanism, which will require custom fabrication.</p>
<p>- add electronic card-reading capability so that customers can serve themselves 24/7.</p>
<p>- steel, rather than sheet metal, housing for enhanced durability and security.</p>
<p>- more sensors on the storage tank to permit automated control.</p>
<p>- fully computerized controls to enable deployment of unit in unstaffed, remote locations.</p>
<p>We aim to complete the development of this model and win state certification of it within four months of attaining our $50,000 fundraising goal.  Then, thanks to your support, you may see 100% vegetable oil fuel coming to your home neighborhood!</p>

The six of us pictured below (plus one more) have devoted our scarce cash resources since 2005 to successfully proving that our patented technology can enable any diesel engine to run on clean, safe, powerful and inexpensive 100% straight vegetable oil fuel.  That’s right – like the stuff you buy at the grocery store or that comes off a restaurant fryer!
The last step to this beneficial fuel’s going nationwide is a specialized, improved Filling Station, one that your support will allow us to build.  Then, we can replicate it around the country!
100% straight vegetable oil fuel is a true alternative to petroleum diesel that can play a significant role in alleviating global warming.  Our operation is lean because we are doing everything possible to help this fuel gain wide acceptance.  (Only three of the six of us are drawing even minimal wages.).
We are humbled and honored that you consider supporting our construction of an improved Filling Station for 100% vegetable oil fuel at our home in Albuquerque!  Any funding beyond this goal will enable us to build additional Stations.  If you will kindly fill out our online questionnaire to let us know where your funding is coming from, we can prioritize new Filling Stations to suit your geographic location!  Our updates will keep you posted! 
 
Clean, Safe, Powerful and Inexpensive 100% Plant Oil Fuel

 
How long do you think this jatropha seed will burn for?  When you watch this video, you may gain an appreciation for the viability of 100% plant oil fuel!
 
The Need for Funding to Build an Improved Filling Station
Our existing, prototype Filling Station pictured in the video above consists of a hodge-podge of components made for petroleum diesel.  In 2012, it gained the State of New Mexico's approval as being accurate for general, commercial use.
However, since vegetable oil has a higher viscosity, or thickness, than petroleum diesel, and it must remain warm to be fluid, we need to make adaptations if we are to be able to replicate this across the country:
- modify the nozzle and the fuel filtering mechanism, which will require custom fabrication.
- add electronic card-reading capability so that customers can serve themselves 24/7.
- steel, rather than sheet metal, housing for enhanced durability and security.
- more sensors on the storage tank to permit automated control.
- fully computerized controls to enable deployment of unit in unstaffed, remote locations.
We aim to complete the development of this model and win state certification of it within four months of attaining our $50,000 fundraising goal.  Then, thanks to your support, you may see 100% vegetable oil fuel coming to your home neighborhood!
Improved Filling Station


 
            Proven Engine Technology
Since 2005, POP Diesel™ has successfully installed our equipment after-market on more than thirty different kinds of diesel engines, everything from a small Volkswagen TDI, to pick-up and semi trucks, to a stationary generator as big as your bedroom or kitchen.  Here is our latest configuration on a big rig:

<h2 style=""margin-left: 210px;"">Das Projekt</h2>
<p>UniversalToolBox ist das Projekt eines dreiköpfigen Teams von Handwerkern, die gemeinsam ein unschlagbares Werkzeugkoffersystem entwickelt haben.</p>
<p>Um den Handwerkern im Kundendiensteinsatz Zeit und den Kunden damit auch Geld zu sparen wurde das patentierte Multitool aus einem individuell einrichtbarem Werkzeugkoffer und einer Trittleiter erschaffen.</p>
<p>Die Toolstep ist, durch das Werkzeughalter-Stecksystem, nicht nur für jedes Gewerk einsetzbar, sondern jede Neuerung kann wie ein PC-Add-On dazugekauft und eingefügt werden. Dadurch bleibt die Toolstep immer auf dem neuesten Stand und kann bei kaputten Werkzeughaltern günstig repariert werden ohne sie einzuschicken!</p>
<p>Schnellere Abwicklung, zufriedenere Kunden, mehr Aufträge und eine wesentliche Arbeitserleichterung für den Handwerker. Das muss ein Werkzeugkoffer heute Leisten!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 210px;"">Die Toolstep</h2>
<p>Dies sind Bilder unseres ersten, von Hand gebauten Prototypen welche euch die Funktion der einzelnen Teile näher bringen sollen. Das Serienprodukt wird selbverständlich wesentlich ansprechender und hochwertiger aussehen! Ein Prototyp aus Orginalmaterial ist derzeit in Arbeit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 150px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.universaltoolbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_0672-b-2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Der Tritt</h3>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.universaltoolbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_0656-b-2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 300px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.universaltoolbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_0593-b-2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wenn man den Deckel der Toolstep abnimmt klappt er beim aufstellen auf den Boden zu einem vollwertigen Leitertritt mit Zwischenstufen auf.</p>
<p>Bei der Entwicklung wurde strengstens auf die von der Berufsgenossenschaft vorgeschriebenen Normen und Vorschriften für Leitern und Tritte geachtet und somit wird der Tritt auch eine berufsgenossenschaftliche Zulassung erhalten. Die hierfür benötigte Prüfung wird von Seiten der Berufsgenossenschaft allerdings erst am Serienprodukt vorgenommen.</p>
<p>Der Tritt kann, dank der besonderen Klapp- und Verriegelmechanik, einhändig transportiert werden und sogar über den Boden geschoben werden ohne zusammenzuklappen. Dies ist wichtig, da auf der Baustelle oftmals die Hände gerade dann nicht frei sind, wenn man den Tritt bewegen möchte.</p>
<p>Wird der Tritt im aufgeklappten zustand auf das Innenteil gesetzt, klappt er automatisch an den Führungsschienen zusammen und umschließt es komplett.</p>
<p>Die Trittstufen liegen in geschlossenem Zustand aber nicht am Innenteil an, sondern verriegeln sich gegenseitig durch die Klappmechanik. Das verhindert</p>
<p>ein Klappern der Trittstufen beim Transport.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Nicht nur Trittmöglichkeit</strong></p>
<p>sondern auch eine Arbeitsfläche zum Sägen und Bohren (letzteres dank dem mittigen Loch für den Griff) und eine Möglichkeit sich in der Pause hinzusetzen, und damit nicht genug! Das Innenteil kann auf den Tritt gestellt werden um eine ergonomische Arbeitshöhe herzustellen. Besonders bei der Schaltschrankverdrahtung und ähnlichen Aufgaben ist dies unerlässlich um die Gesundheit des Rückens zu wahren.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

Das Projekt
UniversalToolBox ist das Projekt eines dreiköpfigen Teams von Handwerkern, die gemeinsam ein unschlagbares Werkzeugkoffersystem entwickelt haben.
Um den Handwerkern im Kundendiensteinsatz Zeit und den Kunden damit auch Geld zu sparen wurde das patentierte Multitool aus einem individuell einrichtbarem Werkzeugkoffer und einer Trittleiter erschaffen.
Die Toolstep ist, durch das Werkzeughalter-Stecksystem, nicht nur für jedes Gewerk einsetzbar, sondern jede Neuerung kann wie ein PC-Add-On dazugekauft und eingefügt werden. Dadurch bleibt die Toolstep immer auf dem neuesten Stand und kann bei kaputten Werkzeughaltern günstig repariert werden ohne sie einzuschicken!
Schnellere Abwicklung, zufriedenere Kunden, mehr Aufträge und eine wesentliche Arbeitserleichterung für den Handwerker. Das muss ein Werkzeugkoffer heute Leisten!
 
 
Die Toolstep
Dies sind Bilder unseres ersten, von Hand gebauten Prototypen welche euch die Funktion der einzelnen Teile näher bringen sollen. Das Serienprodukt wird selbverständlich wesentlich ansprechender und hochwertiger aussehen! Ein Prototyp aus Orginalmaterial ist derzeit in Arbeit.
 

Der Tritt


 
Wenn man den Deckel der Toolstep abnimmt klappt er beim aufstellen auf den Boden zu einem vollwertigen Leitertritt mit Zwischenstufen auf.
Bei der Entwicklung wurde strengstens auf die von der Berufsgenossenschaft vorgeschriebenen Normen und Vorschriften für Leitern und Tritte geachtet und somit wird der Tritt auch eine berufsgenossenschaftliche Zulassung erhalten. Die hierfür benötigte Prüfung wird von Seiten der Berufsgenossenschaft allerdings erst am Serienprodukt vorgenommen.
Der Tritt kann, dank der besonderen Klapp- und Verriegelmechanik, einhändig transportiert werden und sogar über den Boden geschoben werden ohne zusammenzuklappen. Dies ist wichtig, da auf der Baustelle oftmals die Hände gerade dann nicht frei sind, wenn man den Tritt bewegen möchte.
Wird der Tritt im aufgeklappten zustand auf das Innenteil gesetzt, klappt er automatisch an den Führungsschienen zusammen und umschließt es komplett.
Die Trittstufen liegen in geschlossenem Zustand aber nicht am Innenteil an, sondern verriegeln sich gegenseitig durch die Klappmechanik. Das verhindert
ein Klappern der Trittstufen beim Transport.
 
Nicht nur Trittmöglichkeit
sondern auch eine Arbeitsfläche zum Sägen und Bohren (letzteres dank dem mittigen Loch für den Griff) und eine Möglichkeit sich in der Pause hinzusetzen, und damit nicht genug! Das Innenteil kann auf den Tritt gestellt werden um eine ergonomische Arbeitshöhe herzustellen. Besonders bei der Schaltschrankverdrahtung und ähnlichen Aufgaben ist dies unerlässlich um die Gesundheit des Rückens zu wahren.
 
 
 
Das Innenteil

Unsere Erfahrung Zeigt: kein Werkzeugsatz gleicht dem anderen. Daher bietet das Innenleben, auf Grund des Stecksystems, völlige Freiheit beim Einrichten auf das persönliche Werkzeug.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Die Werkzeugträger und Schubladenboxen werden Außen platziert, während  der klappbare Griff den Zugriff in den geräumigen Innenraum freigibt. hier Finden Maulschlüsselsätze, große Quetsch- und Rohrzangen, Messgeräte und kleine Maschinen, wie beispielsweise ein Mini-Akkuschrauber, Platz.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Alles hat seinen Platz. Somit lässt sich das Werkzeug auch problemlos im Dunkeln finden fehlendes Werkzeug fällt sofort auf.
 
 
 
Die Module
 
 
Schubladenbox (kurze Seite)

Eine Box mit 3 Schubladen für Kleinteile. Bis zu 4 dieser Boxen passen in eine Toolstep und jede Schublade hat die Möglichkeit noch einmal in einzelne Fächer unterteilt zu werden.
 
 
 
Die Werkzeughalter wurden so entworfen, dass auch isoliertes Werkzeug problemlos Platz findet!
 
Werkzeughalter 1 - Zangen (kurze Seite)

 
Der Zangenhalter ist so designt, dass Zangen jeglicher Art hineinpassen.
 

 
 
 
Werkzeughalter 2 - Verschiedenes, ohne Boden (kurze Seite)

Im Zusammenspiel mit Werkzeughalter 3 können hier viele Dinge ihren Platz finden, die man sonst nirgends unterbringen kann. Pinsel, Stahlbürsten, Klappmeter, Körner, hier ist Platz für das was euren Werkzeugsatz individuell macht.
 
 
Werkzeughalter 3 - Verschiedenes, mit Boden (kurze Seite)

Auch ohne Werkzeughalter 2 ist dieser Universalhalter vielseitig einsetzbar: Isolierband, Dichtungsband, kleine Bitsätze, usw.
 

 
 
 
Werkzeughalter 4 - Schraubendreher, Stemmeisen, Steckschlüssel (lange Seite)

Ob Elektriker, Schreiner oder Heizungsbauer; dieser Werkzeughalter bietet genug Platz für die berufsspezifischen Standardwerkzeuge.
 
 
 
 
Werkzeughalter 5 - Verschiedenes (lange Seite)

Hier ist Platz für große Werkzeuge wie Rohrzange, Hammer und Wasserwaage.

Wohin gegen die Gelder genau?
Etwa 250 000 Euro werden in die Konstruktion und Produktion der Spritzgussformen gehen.
Der Rest wird benötigt um in Vorleistung zu treten für :

Material zum Spritzgießen (von der BASF neu entwickelter Glasfaserkunststoff )
Lohnarbeit Spritzguss
Herstellung  der Aluminiumstufen und Aluminiumlaserteile für das Innenleben
Verpackung und Versand
sonstige laufende Kosten die die Serienproduktion mit sich trägt
Wenn das Crowdfunding-Ziel überschritten wird können wir schneller an neuen Werkzeughaltern und andern Add-Ons arbeiten und eventuell bereits in die Perks mit einfließen lassen. Eine zukaufbare Trollifunktion ist bereits in Planung.
Privat werden zunächst keine gelder entnommen da wir alle ein geregeltes einkommen haben.

<p>Possible risks identified for project LOPER include:</p>
<p>-Unforeseen delays affecting our sole manufacturer. <br/>-Unforeseen delays at our shoe factories</p>
<p>We strive to minimise the impact of these risks for our supporters and customers. Should anything disrupt our commitments, we will provide suitable solutions and compensation where necessary.</p>
<p>Project LOPER aims for full transparency at all levels. We will keep you informed during the production process and alert of any delay as soon as it is made known.</p>
</div></div>","Sure, there are lots of new styles and innovations from the big brands. But what about real change and innovation in terms of sustainability and worker well-being?
 -Did you know about the impossibility of shoe- recycling? 
 -Why should we claim new materials over and over again? 
 -Why should we ship materials all over the world and back? 
- Why should workers be exposed to huge quantities of toxic glue? 

Fabricating beautiful shoes is great. Fabricating beautiful shoes responsibly is even better!


Designs are basic & subtile, yet distinctive due to the twist of contrasting ropes.

Result; You will end up with a perfectly balanced style.



LOPER shoes are based on a glue-less principle. 

It's our goal to make an innovative change in existing production methods.

....where shoe factories are generally UNHEALTHY workplaces; mainly because of large quantities of toxic glue use.

By supporting LOPER you will help the industry become LESS HARMFUL.

No Glue , Lots of Glory!



Special feature of LOPER is the INTERCHANGEABILITY of the complete outsoles.

.......which are perforated to easy fasten the outsole to the upper part.

It enables you to either repair your shoes or making new exciting combinations!


So are you looking for Elegance, Innovation and Efficiency all in one shoe that still functions like it is supposed to? You definitely should try LOPER.

</h3>
<p>I am a graphic artist and a fashion designer (honors MFA degree in Wroclaw Academy of Fine Arts in Poland.)</p>
<p> My achievements include individual exhibitions in Sweden, China and Poland as well as individual fashion collection shows in Sweden.</p>

<h2><strong>My collection.</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>The <strong>“BLACK SHADOW OF COLOR”</strong> collection will be my debut for wider public viewing and also the beginning of the new “TATI BODUCH” brand.</p>
<p>This collection is addressed to women aged 25-55, who <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">appreciate elegance</span> and have a creative approach to their appearance. It is designed for women who like wearing original and slightly extravagant clothes and for whom the quality of materials, workmanship and comfort of wearing are of great importance.</p>
<p>As the dominant color of the collection I have chosen black. Not only is my choice of this color dictated by the fact that black is the favorite of the season or an “always fashionable” color. As a graphic artist I know how a black background makes other colors look stronger and more effective.</p>
<p>In contrast to my previous collection, which can be found on my website tatimode.com, this time my collection was limited to dresses only.</p>
<p>I will not reveal all secrets of the future collection. I will only say that many different techniques and inspirations from various trends will be used.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>""Collage"" of some sketches of my new collection:</em></strong><img alt=""sketches of new callection"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://images38.fotosik.pl/1897/9582454718675654.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""sketches of new callection""/></p>
<p class=""r"">My projects have been very positively evaluated by experts in the fashion industry, who appreciated the concept’s maturity, high workmanship and the fact that I do not copy other artists’ ideas – I just “transfer” my own ideas onto fabric.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe I am a mature enough personality in the fashion design industry to show my collections to the wider world and promote my own brand.</p>
<p>I already have a graphic sign (logo) of the prospective brand, as well as a designer nickname.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>
<strong> </strong><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong>
</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>The resources received from you are intended to be used for the preparation and presentation of my fashion collection at the largest fashion event in Poland – Poland Fashion Week, whose eighth edition will take place on the 17<sup>th</sup>-21<sup>st</sup> April 2013.</p>
<p>“Fashion Philosophy” – the Poland Fashion Week is the biggest fashion event in the East-Central Europe. The event takes place twice a year – the spring edition presenting Autumn/Winter trends scheduled for the 17<sup>th</sup>-21<sup>st</sup> April 2013, as well as the autumn edition presenting Spring/Summer trends. Each edition of the Fashion Week receives lots of attention from the media, which includes hundreds of publications in the press, on the Internet, and many reports on the radio and television. “Collezzioni Uomo” and “Collezioni Donna” also report about the Polish Fashion Week shows, along with other most prestigious fashion weeks in the world.</p>
<p>The total cost of the preparation and presentation of the collection amounts to over 15 000 USD but since a part of the collection has already been made and I do most of the work by myself, I need to collect just under half that amount.</p>

</tbody></table><p> If more money than I ask for is collected or if the OUT OFF SCHEDULE show committee exempts my collection from the participation costs, all extra money will be used for the expansion of the created collection, the creation of small accessories for clothes and additional promotion of the show.</p>
<p>All sponsors with links to their blogs or websites will be listed (if they do not have anything against it, of course) on my Funders page.</p>
<p>When my brand is already known around the world – and I strongly believe it will be, even those sponsors who donated the smallest amount of money will see their names on the Funders list among those who contributed to the collection’s creation and success.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>About me.</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>I was born in Russia. As a quite young person I “instinctively” set off in the footsteps of my parents and became an engineer but in spite of a successful student’s life and very good scientific and creative work I was not satisfied. I was attracted to art and design.</p>
<p>Family matters made me move to Poland. I enrolled into the Academy of Fine Arts in Wroclaw, where I defended my diploma paper with honors and graduated from two departments. In order to develop my artistic skills, I worked several times more than normally. I did it all so that I never had to struggle with technical problems while proceeding to the implementation of my ideas.</p>
<p>As an artist, I like fabric. I have been sewing and modeling clothes my entire life. However, artistic education gave me many more possibilities in this field. It also changed my perception of clothes as objects of design, in which the composition of colors, structures, textures and graphic curves create a unique whole.</p>
<p>I like color, beauty and elegance. In my projects I wish to show optimism, joy and beauty of the world. I cannot do anything without love and I put my love in my creative work, trying to improve the world around me and in this way I try to contribute to the overall harmony.</p>
<p>My first collection was presented in Scandinavia, mainly in Sweden, at small individual shows. It raised interest and lots of questions among the audience. The collection was also positively evaluated by a Swedish local newspaper reporting on fashion events. I presented my first collection under the name “Mosaic,” because it combined a wide range of colors, techniques and styles. That collection was inspired by retro and folk styles (patch work.) I produced all the clothes very carefully and it took a few months of hard work, but the result gave me great satisfaction.</p>

<p> </p></div>","My name is Tatiana Boduch.

I am a graphic artist and a fashion designer (honors MFA degree in Wroclaw Academy of Fine Arts in Poland.)
 My achievements include individual exhibitions in Sweden, China and Poland as well as individual fashion collection shows in Sweden.
 
 
 
I have two websites:
www.tatiboduch.com (art) i
www.tatimode.com (fashion.)
You can see movie about my arts in youtube:

My collection.
 The “BLACK SHADOW OF COLOR” collection will be my debut for wider public viewing and also the beginning of the new “TATI BODUCH” brand.
This collection is addressed to women aged 25-55, who appreciate elegance and have a creative approach to their appearance. It is designed for women who like wearing original and slightly extravagant clothes and for whom the quality of materials, workmanship and comfort of wearing are of great importance.
As the dominant color of the collection I have chosen black. Not only is my choice of this color dictated by the fact that black is the favorite of the season or an “always fashionable” color. As a graphic artist I know how a black background makes other colors look stronger and more effective.
In contrast to my previous collection, which can be found on my website tatimode.com, this time my collection was limited to dresses only.
I will not reveal all secrets of the future collection. I will only say that many different techniques and inspirations from various trends will be used.
 
""Collage"" of some sketches of my new collection:
My projects have been very positively evaluated by experts in the fashion industry, who appreciated the concept’s maturity, high workmanship and the fact that I do not copy other artists’ ideas – I just “transfer” my own ideas onto fabric.
Therefore, I believe I am a mature enough personality in the fashion design industry to show my collections to the wider world and promote my own brand.
I already have a graphic sign (logo) of the prospective brand, as well as a designer nickname.
 

 What We Need & What You Get

 The resources received from you are intended to be used for the preparation and presentation of my fashion collection at the largest fashion event in Poland – Poland Fashion Week, whose eighth edition will take place on the 17th-21st April 2013.
“Fashion Philosophy” – the Poland Fashion Week is the biggest fashion event in the East-Central Europe. The event takes place twice a year – the spring edition presenting Autumn/Winter trends scheduled for the 17th-21st April 2013, as well as the autumn edition presenting Spring/Summer trends. Each edition of the Fashion Week receives lots of attention from the media, which includes hundreds of publications in the press, on the Internet, and many reports on the radio and television. “Collezzioni Uomo” and “Collezioni Donna” also report about the Polish Fashion Week shows, along with other most prestigious fashion weeks in the world.
The total cost of the preparation and presentation of the collection amounts to over 15 000 USD but since a part of the collection has already been made and I do most of the work by myself, I need to collect just under half that amount.
 
Where your support will go:  



  3800 USD


the cost of the participation in the OUT OFF SCHEDULE shows on the FASHION WEEK Poland




  1000 USD


PR costs




    950 USD


the purchase of fabrics




    650 USD


the cost of models’ salaries and photo shoots in a studio




    600 USD


the trip to the FASHION WEEK, hotels and transport costs




     500 USD


other costs (including commission for INDIEGOGO)


 If more money than I ask for is collected or if the OUT OFF SCHEDULE show committee exempts my collection from the participation costs, all extra money will be used for the expansion of the created collection, the creation of small accessories for clothes and additional promotion of the show.
All sponsors with links to their blogs or websites will be listed (if they do not have anything against it, of course) on my Funders page.
When my brand is already known around the world – and I strongly believe it will be, even those sponsors who donated the smallest amount of money will see their names on the Funders list among those who contributed to the collection’s creation and success.
  
About me.
 I was born in Russia. As a quite young person I “instinctively” set off in the footsteps of my parents and became an engineer but in spite of a successful student’s life and very good scientific and creative work I was not satisfied. I was attracted to art and design.
Family matters made me move to Poland. I enrolled into the Academy of Fine Arts in Wroclaw, where I defended my diploma paper with honors and graduated from two departments. In order to develop my artistic skills, I worked several times more than normally. I did it all so that I never had to struggle with technical problems while proceeding to the implementation of my ideas.
As an artist, I like fabric. I have been sewing and modeling clothes my entire life. However, artistic education gave me many more possibilities in this field. It also changed my perception of clothes as objects of design, in which the composition of colors, structures, textures and graphic curves create a unique whole.
I like color, beauty and elegance. In my projects I wish to show optimism, joy and beauty of the world. I cannot do anything without love and I put my love in my creative work, trying to improve the world around me and in this way I try to contribute to the overall harmony.
My first collection was presented in Scandinavia, mainly in Sweden, at small individual shows. It raised interest and lots of questions among the audience. The collection was also positively evaluated by a Swedish local newspaper reporting on fashion events. I presented my first collection under the name “Mosaic,” because it combined a wide range of colors, techniques and styles. That collection was inspired by retro and folk styles (patch work.) I produced all the clothes very carefully and it took a few months of hard work, but the result gave me great satisfaction.

<p><i>Video coming soon!</i></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The inspiration for our VSRI Timepieces was sparked by the artistic designs we came in to contact with while living in Washington, D.C. and travelling to areas all around the world such as Europe, Tanzania, Peru, and the Far East. During these travels we found a strong interest in the intricacies we saw in the distinct architecture and tools of these regions from years passed. </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The name “VSRI” stems from the Italian painter, writer, and architect, Giorgio Vasari, of the Renaissance Era who was best known for infusing his creativity into architecture, which he absorbed as an apprentice under the famous Michelangelo. Vasari has been credited for bringing “style” into architecture.</p>
<p>Our goal is to use unique materials, starting with wood, to give you not only a finely tuned and precise timepiece, but also a product which can be seen as a piece of art. We are here to provide you with a watch that has a style that CANNOT BE REPLICATED. </p>
<p>We know you can find other wooden watches. And, we also know that some of them look great! We even own a few. But, we've yet to find a watch which pairs well with formal wear as well as casual wear. Our ""Arezzo"" model, named after Vasari's home town, is the first wooden watch that we feel is acceptable to wear not only to the pub down the street, but also to work every day. Whether your wearing a suit and tie or T and jeans, we know you will look great in any of our VSRI Timepieces.</p>
<p><b>We will try our very best to get these to you by Christmas! If for some reason we can't, we will send your friends and family cards, at your request, telling them their VSRI timepiece is on its way!</b><br/></p>
<p><strong>If we can manage to raise even more money than expected will we introduce even more wood combinations based upon input from our comments section! New woods can include Rosewood, Oak, Cherry, Koa, and more. Just let us know what you want and if we raise enough we'll see if we can supply you with even more styles and combinations!</strong></p>

The inspiration for our VSRI Timepieces was sparked by the artistic designs we came in to contact with while living in Washington, D.C. and travelling to areas all around the world such as Europe, Tanzania, Peru, and the Far East. During these travels we found a strong interest in the intricacies we saw in the distinct architecture and tools of these regions from years passed. 

The name “VSRI” stems from the Italian painter, writer, and architect, Giorgio Vasari, of the Renaissance Era who was best known for infusing his creativity into architecture, which he absorbed as an apprentice under the famous Michelangelo. Vasari has been credited for bringing “style” into architecture.
Our goal is to use unique materials, starting with wood, to give you not only a finely tuned and precise timepiece, but also a product which can be seen as a piece of art. We are here to provide you with a watch that has a style that CANNOT BE REPLICATED. 
We know you can find other wooden watches. And, we also know that some of them look great! We even own a few. But, we've yet to find a watch which pairs well with formal wear as well as casual wear. Our ""Arezzo"" model, named after Vasari's home town, is the first wooden watch that we feel is acceptable to wear not only to the pub down the street, but also to work every day. Whether your wearing a suit and tie or T and jeans, we know you will look great in any of our VSRI Timepieces.
We will try our very best to get these to you by Christmas! If for some reason we can't, we will send your friends and family cards, at your request, telling them their VSRI timepiece is on its way!
If we can manage to raise even more money than expected will we introduce even more wood combinations based upon input from our comments section! New woods can include Rosewood, Oak, Cherry, Koa, and more. Just let us know what you want and if we raise enough we'll see if we can supply you with even more styles and combinations!

It's like magic, we know!</p><p>With over 90% natural ingredients [that's practically unheard of in a mascara!] this is a mascara you, and your lashes, will love.</p><p><strong>THE LOOK</strong></p><p>This mascara offers a classic elegance; an enhanced, natural, everyday look. Ultimate length and definition, but never any spidery looking lashes (yikes). Just long, beautiful lash loveliness, here.</p><p><strong>THE BRUSH</strong></p><p>Our special lash-hugging brush ensures every little and long lash you have gets well coated, maximizing volume and length without sacrificing definition. Plus, its unique shape means your lashes automatically get extra lift and curl.  Good deal! And, so pretty.</p><p><strong>THE FORMULA</strong></p><p>Our proprietary formula is packed with natural ingredients, including the plant-based weightless moisturizer squalane.  Your lashes will love it! Plus, did we mention NO MORE CLUMPS. A dream come true,we get it.</p><p><strong>THE COLOR</strong></p><p>Can mascara ever be TOO black? We think not, but we gave it a go. Steering clear from potentially toxic dyes that you’ll still find in many commercial mascaras (we are looking at you, D&amp;C Black No. 2),  ours is what we call Luscious Black… because that is how your lashes will look. So luscious.</p><p><strong>LASTING LUSCIOUSNESS</strong></p><p>Let’s talk staying power. Our mascara is not waterproof. But,you might think it is because it will not flake, smudge, sweat or cry off. Even your post-massage face will be surprisingly put together.  It’s thanks to certain natural ingredients that we can provide this kind of coverage, but the flip side is that it can take an extra bit to remove at the sink. That’s why we also offer the perfect remover and eco-friendly eraser wipes. We’ve got you covered!</p><p>If you remove it in the shower it's super easy.  Just let warm water run over your face for about 10 seconds and gently massage your lashes. Your mascara will disappear - with no raccoon eyes left behind.</p><p><strong>AND OF COURSE</strong></p><p>All of our products are always: vegan, cruelty free, gluten free, paraben free, mineral oil free, beeswax free and paraffin free. That's a lot of free!</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592959369/nopbpt4w8nmb5in55nwi.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>FAQ</h2><p><strong>WHY LITTLE MASCARA?</strong></p><p>Two reasons, really.</p><p>1) We ALL know it’s unhealthy to keep a mascara around for too long but often simply forget to buy a new one. Even the FDA recommends you toss your mascara after 3 months. A little bottle provides the right amount needed so you always have fresh, safe mascara to use – and none goes to waste.</p><p>2) Shorter wands are SO much easier to use. Once you try it you’ll never want to go back to long mascara wands.  Not only do you have better dexterity since your hand is closer to where you are applying, but you can also get better angles for thicker applications that result in more volume.</p><p>Yay for fresh, easier to use and bigger lashes!</p><p><strong>IS THIS VEGAN + CRUELTY-FREE?</strong></p><p>Yes! ? All of our products are always: vegan, cruelty free, gluten free, paraben free, mineral oil free, beeswax free and paraffin free.</p><p><strong>HOW CAN YOU SHIP SO FAST?</strong></p><p>Elves!  JK. We only hire those in December. </p><p>We have been at this a LOOOONG time. We waited to launch our indiegogo until we were 100% sure of dates for all products. Our indiegogo is short and sweet.  Just like us.</p><p><strong>WHY ARE YOU A CLUB?</strong></p><p>Because we plan to offer a subscription – we’ll make it easy to have fresh, awesome mascara on hand exactly when you need it.  *All indiegogo purchases are a one-time purchase, not a subscription. You can sign up for a subscription later, if you want.</p><p><strong>HOW OFTEN SHOULD I CHANGE MY MASCARA?</strong></p><p>The FDA recommends you <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/resources-consumers-cosmetics/cosmetics-safety-qa-shelf-life"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">toss your mascara after 3 months</a>.</p><p>We’ve all been culprit to keeping a mascara around WAY too long. ? And, we all know it’s easy for bacteria to accumulate and the mascara to get clumpy and gross. Then comes the fiasco of trying to remember to pick one up at the store.  This is why we will offer memberships!</p><p>On average, our “little” mascara lasts 6 weeks with daily use. Those who don’t use it daily can see it lasting much longer.

   ABOUT THE MASCARAOur original LENGTH + DEFINITION mascara formula has incredible staying power [it is smear proof, sweat proof, smudge proof and budge proof] yet removes with just water. It's like magic, we know!With over 90% natural ingredients [that's practically unheard of in a mascara!] this is a mascara you, and your lashes, will love.THE LOOKThis mascara offers a classic elegance; an enhanced, natural, everyday look. Ultimate length and definition, but never any spidery looking lashes (yikes). Just long, beautiful lash loveliness, here.THE BRUSHOur special lash-hugging brush ensures every little and long lash you have gets well coated, maximizing volume and length without sacrificing definition. Plus, its unique shape means your lashes automatically get extra lift and curl.  Good deal! And, so pretty.THE FORMULAOur proprietary formula is packed with natural ingredients, including the plant-based weightless moisturizer squalane.  Your lashes will love it! Plus, did we mention NO MORE CLUMPS. A dream come true,we get it.THE COLORCan mascara ever be TOO black? We think not, but we gave it a go. Steering clear from potentially toxic dyes that you’ll still find in many commercial mascaras (we are looking at you, D&C Black No. 2),  ours is what we call Luscious Black… because that is how your lashes will look. So luscious.LASTING LUSCIOUSNESSLet’s talk staying power. Our mascara is not waterproof. But,you might think it is because it will not flake, smudge, sweat or cry off. Even your post-massage face will be surprisingly put together.  It’s thanks to certain natural ingredients that we can provide this kind of coverage, but the flip side is that it can take an extra bit to remove at the sink. That’s why we also offer the perfect remover and eco-friendly eraser wipes. We’ve got you covered!If you remove it in the shower it's super easy.  Just let warm water run over your face for about 10 seconds and gently massage your lashes. Your mascara will disappear - with no raccoon eyes left behind.AND OF COURSEAll of our products are always: vegan, cruelty free, gluten free, paraben free, mineral oil free, beeswax free and paraffin free. That's a lot of free!  FAQWHY LITTLE MASCARA?Two reasons, really.1) We ALL know it’s unhealthy to keep a mascara around for too long but often simply forget to buy a new one. Even the FDA recommends you toss your mascara after 3 months. A little bottle provides the right amount needed so you always have fresh, safe mascara to use – and none goes to waste.2) Shorter wands are SO much easier to use. Once you try it you’ll never want to go back to long mascara wands.  Not only do you have better dexterity since your hand is closer to where you are applying, but you can also get better angles for thicker applications that result in more volume.Yay for fresh, easier to use and bigger lashes!IS THIS VEGAN + CRUELTY-FREE?Yes! ? All of our products are always: vegan, cruelty free, gluten free, paraben free, mineral oil free, beeswax free and paraffin free.HOW CAN YOU SHIP SO FAST?Elves!  JK. We only hire those in December. We have been at this a LOOOONG time. We waited to launch our indiegogo until we were 100% sure of dates for all products. Our indiegogo is short and sweet.  Just like us.WHY ARE YOU A CLUB?Because we plan to offer a subscription – we’ll make it easy to have fresh, awesome mascara on hand exactly when you need it.  *All indiegogo purchases are a one-time purchase, not a subscription. You can sign up for a subscription later, if you want.HOW OFTEN SHOULD I CHANGE MY MASCARA?The FDA recommends you toss your mascara after 3 months.We’ve all been culprit to keeping a mascara around WAY too long. ? And, we all know it’s easy for bacteria to accumulate and the mascara to get clumpy and gross. Then comes the fiasco of trying to remember to pick one up at the store.  This is why we will offer memberships!On average, our “little” mascara lasts 6 weeks with daily use. Those who don’t use it daily can see it lasting much longer. However, we never recommend keeping any mascara for more than a few months – give yourself a fresh, sanitary one!  Your eyes will thank you.WHY REUSABLE REMOVER WIPES?Did you know that over 20 million make-up wipes a day are thrown in the trash?

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>When we created the Ring Clock concept, we suspected that this product would not be just a unique timepiece that makes the jewelry industry more colorful, but it would be capable of breaking the ice at the beginning of a conversation too.</p>
<p>We were very happy when the first evidences arrived from our kind customers - „it is definitely a conversation starter, and I get a lot of attention when I wear it…”, „… my ring clock has been a huge HIT!!!. definitely a conversation ice breaker!”, „It's always a conversation opener everywhere I go …”, and a kind story from our team - Sandor showed the Ring Clock to his friend in a pizzeria. After the dinner, the waitress kindly apologized for interrupting the conversation and wanted to know more about the Ring Clock. When Sandor left the restaurant, the very nice waitress had new questions again and they talked on the street for a few minutes.</p>
<p>The examples show that a small, crazy product can awaken our curiosity and sometimes it allows us to become a bit more open and friendly.</p>
<p>We know that more people would wear Ring Clock if it were thinner or if there is another wearing option. We are manufacturing on the border of technology capabilities, therefore we cannot reduce the thickness yet. For this reason, we have come back with a bracelet concept now, in order to give a new wearing dimension to Ring Clock.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512161119/az4ffleypsqn4leiza9e.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>WristSet</strong> is designed for those:</p>
<p>- who love unique, sometimes crazy timepieces or jewels and prefer to wear them on their wrist rather than their fingers,</p>
<p>- and it is useful for ring fans too, when they want to hold their gadget on a safe base until their fingers need more freedom (e.g. gardening, typing etc.).</p>
<p>We would like to give the magic of Ring Clock for more people, so we hope that our concept will receive your support and we can develop a wider Ring Clock collection.</p>
<h3>The WristSet</h3>
<p>WristSet is a bracelet accessory of Ring Clock with unique look and function - it enables you to wear the ring engine on your wrist too.</p>

<p>- when it doesn’t need to hold Ring Clock, it is in closed state, and it does not do anything, just looks nice :)</p>
<p>- when you want to wear your Ring Clock on your wrist, then you can fix it on the bracelet easily by the WristSet dial rotation - fixed state.</p>

<p>There is one collection for men and one for women, both of them with 4 models, so that everyone can find the one they love best.</p>
<p>We use standard 20mm and 16mm strap pin connections, so if you have a special favorite strap, you can attach it to the WristSet.</p>

PVD covered Black and Gold color versions were announced and Ring Clock was a highlighted brand on the Hong Kong Watch &amp; Clock Fair in 2016.</p>
<p>Nowadays you can find only 6000 pieces Ring Clocks all around the world and you can meet them in some offline shops in Hong Kong or Kyoto.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our custom metal parts are not easy tasks for a manufacturer. We have contacted more than 40 potential manufacturers (watch parts, CNC milling, powder metallurgy, jewelry suppliers) in order to find the best technology for our purpose.</p>
<p>After testing of the samples, we plan to start the finalization work with the best potential supplier, but if our effort won’t be successful with them within 2 months, we will continue the work with the next manufacturer of the short list. We calculated the delivery time with the best case, therefore if we have to change our supplier, please note that it may cause some delay in the delivery.</p>
<p>Updates: We will regularly inform you about the project progress in every month by Indiegogo updates. They will be transparent with all of the results, unexpected issues and how we plan to solve them as we did it in the Ring Clock project earlier.</p>
<p>Please support our new project and we will reward you with a unique bracelet and timepiece - THANK YOU!</p>

Our custom metal parts are not easy tasks for a manufacturer. We have contacted more than 40 potential manufacturers (watch parts, CNC milling, powder metallurgy, jewelry suppliers) in order to find the best technology for our purpose.
After testing of the samples, we plan to start the finalization work with the best potential supplier, but if our effort won’t be successful with them within 2 months, we will continue the work with the next manufacturer of the short list. We calculated the delivery time with the best case, therefore if we have to change our supplier, please note that it may cause some delay in the delivery.
Updates: We will regularly inform you about the project progress in every month by Indiegogo updates. They will be transparent with all of the results, unexpected issues and how we plan to solve them as we did it in the Ring Clock project earlier.
Please support our new project and we will reward you with a unique bracelet and timepiece - THANK YOU!

<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>This campaign is called ""Pick A Pile - Bag In Style"". Our purpose is to make the tedious job of leaf pickup a thing of style and good backyard fun and fasion.  We think that operating the Leaf Picker Upper will make leaf pickup mor fun and very easy as compared to what is presently available.  The goal is to make the Picker Upper as common as a rake or the use of your two hands.  The good thing is it only takes one hand.  This will revolusionize the job of leaaf pickup for everyone who gives it a try.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>We are lookiing for funding to perfect and streamline the product (make it a little more slimline if possible).  We are also exploring research and development of PVC vs. light grade metal.  We have not begun our marketing campaign yet but we would like to kick it into high gear so that people like you can get thier hands on a Leaf picker Upper sooner rather than later; although later is also good just as long as you get yours.  We have plans to take care of the expenses related to presenting the picker Upper in home, garden and trade shows.  Finally one of our goals is to look into professional video and graphics to help promote our products and accessories.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>One of the great perks that we have for this campaign is another newly invented product. Our plastic Foldup Bag funnel.  The bag funnel is also a revolusionary product that is going to speed up the leaf pickup process.  It is just that a funnel. It allows you to pick up a large pile of leaves drop it into the leaf bag and not worry about dropping outside of the bag continuously and consistantly.  The funnel provides a 4"" tapered shield on all sides of the bag.  That means you have almost 2 times the area of the original bag size.  The bag size is (14"" x 11"" = 154) sqin.  With the funnel, the opening is increased to (18"" x 15"" = 270) sqin.  Almost twice the opening size to drop your leaf pile from your picker upper into.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>When it is all said and done I am a homeowner with a pile of leaves to be raked and picked up to be bagged just like the next guy.  I found a way to make it aeasier and more efficient.  This will save you time and reove the bordom assocciated with the task.  It will make it a fun experience.  ""Pick A Pile - Bag In Style"".  Thanks for now.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Stay tuned, we have accessory attachments that work in place of the leaf scoops for picking up other things besides leaves; such as doggy litter, kitty litter and an attachment to help reove a light bulb in high unreachable places.  This was too much for one campaign so look for a follow up in the future.</strong></h3>

<p> After launching the MOTION V1 last year, we are on Kickstarter this time again to introduce our new MOTION V2 series. Watches are part of our daily routine, but there were none that aroused emotions in us. That was the foundation of MANYEARS. Our watch isn't just a watch of displaying time, it also reminds us to use every second in our lives useful. </p>

<p> Time. Everyone knows how fast it goes, but only a few of use it properly. Life is constantly in MOTION. The years pass, the pointer turns, time flies. Our life is like an hourglass, every hour you spend is like a grain of sand, once it falls, it never returns. </p>
<p>The hour you've spent is now in the past and it won't turn back. MOTION is not just a watch, MOTION is an emotion.</p>

<p>  It was important to us that the MOTION V2 is not just a conventional watch. We wanted to introduce a watch to the community – modern, a bit futuristic and timeless.

</div></div>","After launching the MOTION V1 last year, we are on Kickstarter this time again to introduce our new MOTION V2 series. Watches are part of our daily routine, but there were none that aroused emotions in us. That was the foundation of MANYEARS. Our watch isn't just a watch of displaying time, it also reminds us to use every second in our lives useful. 

 Time. Everyone knows how fast it goes, but only a few of use it properly. Life is constantly in MOTION. The years pass, the pointer turns, time flies. Our life is like an hourglass, every hour you spend is like a grain of sand, once it falls, it never returns. 
The hour you've spent is now in the past and it won't turn back. MOTION is not just a watch, MOTION is an emotion.


 You've got the chance to choose from the following options before we ship them to you. We offer 4 different variations and 8 different straps as you can (read below – ""The Straps"") 



 
Every watch features a 316L Stainless Steel Case, Sapphire Crystal and is 50 M Water Resistant. 



The MOTION V2 is assembled in Pforzheim, Germany. Each component in this watch is crafted with extreme caution and workmanship. Our goal was creating the perfect quality timepiece.


  It was important to us that the MOTION V2 is not just a conventional watch. We wanted to introduce a watch to the community – modern, a bit futuristic and timeless. We chose a circle as an hour hand and a semicircle for the minute hand. The red crown sets a minimalistic accent that gives the watch a sporty touch. 




we worked 10-16 hours a day for the MOTION V1, 2 years ago. We made the design of the watch, the video, the photo, the website and all other stuff all by our own. We used my sleeping room to pack all the watches. It was the first launch of our MOTION V1 and it was awesome! This time we will improve our quality and get new team members to manage the work even better. 


 Our watch is 5 ATM water resistant and can be worn during swimming without jumping from a diving board. It is not qualified to snorkel or dive. 


 The first 2000 pieces of the MOTION V2 will be limited and individually numbered. First backed, first served, meaning the earlier you back us, the lower number you will get. 

MOTION V2 watches produced after the first 2,000 watches will not be individually numbered anymore.

<p>Modify's tagline is ""Show Your Colors"". We started as a project in 2010, and have grown into a brand with over 75,000 passionate fans on social media, and hundreds-of-thousands of watches sold through <a href=""http://modifywatches.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">modifywatches.com</a>. See some examples of our handiwork below:</p>

<p>The ""ModiFamily"" (our loyal customer base) has always been part of creating our products. They've named products, informed the launch of our 2nd style, and a few hundred have even contributed designs that we sell on on our site.</p>
<p>With your help, we can launch our first Round, fully-custom watches: the <strong>30mm Rose Gold </strong>finish and the <strong>40mm Gunmetal</strong> finish<b> </b>styles.</p>

<p>Through surveys, social media, and phone calls, they've asked for new styles and features: bigger <i>and</i> smaller; Gunmetal <i>and </i>Rose Gold finishes; square <i>and</i> round form factors. And of course, thinner, water-resistant, etc. We didn't think we could deliver one design that hit everyone's needs, which is why we are planning to launch <u>TWO</u> new styles if this Indiegogo campaign is successful!</p>

<p>To make this happen, we need <u><strong>$15,000</strong></u>. The number is actually a lot lower than any other production we've done because, well, this isn't our first rodeo. Did we mention we've been in business since 2010?</p>

<p>$15,000 will help fund</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Tooling:</strong> the equipment on which our watches are made</li>
<li>
<strong>Inventory:</strong> we need to buy a few thousand watches to get going</li>
<li>
<strong>Customization Software:</strong> the DIY tool on our site so you can get any photo / design on your personalized watch. You can customize 3 styles on <a href=""http://modifywatches.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">modifywatches.com/custom</a> currently. If we hit our goal you'll be able to do it on the new round styles too!</li>
<li>
<strong>Job Creation</strong>: This isn't a direct cost, but just know that you're helping to create jobs in San Francisco.</li>

<p>Also, this is a ""Fixed Funding"" project. <strong>If we don't hit $15,000, we're not taking a cent. </strong>We cannot launch these styles without your support. And folks might never be able to swap strap colors daily on round watches :)</p>

<p>The 30mm and 40mm watches will be the 5th and 6th lines that we've launched (old fans will remember the ""Classic"" size). We've already worked with our factory to create prototypes, determine the cost of tooling, and understand pricing-per-watch.</p>
<p>We decided to do a fixed funding campaign because we know that $15,000 will enable us to launch these two products. Hopefully, from reading reviews of our company and seeing the passion from our community, you'll know that we're not just fundraising to ""launch a new product""; we're WAY more invested in maintaining the love from our fans. </p>
<p>The one significant risk we foresee is that our timeline to deliver might lag (most perks have a June, July or August delivery). Our internal goal is to deliver all watches by May, but we wanted to account for shipping delays. Turns out that there is a *bit* of news on the trade front, if you haven't seen the press lately ...</p>

<p>We are not a charity, and are not asking for donations. We know that not everyone can afford to support - and that some of you just don't want a sweet custom watch. </p>
<p>Our hope, though, is that you'll share our story with friends, family and coworkers who *might* be interested. </p>
<p>Folks who wear a watch check it 10+ times / day ... we hope that they'll be extremely happy when they do so.</p>

<strong>Where is Modify located?</strong> San Francisco</li>
<li>
<strong>When were you founded?</strong> 2010!</li>
<li>
<strong>What do you mean ""CUSTOM""? </strong>Thanks for asking! In the same way that you can put pretty much anything on a t-shirt, we believe that you should be able to wear a timepiece that has <i>exactly</i> what you want on it. So we offer custom watches where you can upload a photo or any art you want.</li>
<li>
<strong>Are these gold?</strong> No, the watches aren't gold! The Rose Gold is a finish, not the full material. We wanted to make sure that you could get a great custom watch at a price you can afford.</li>
<li>
<strong>What if I'm not creative?</strong> We also have thousands (seriously) of designs from the Modify Creative Team as well as hundreds of artists. Check out <a href=""http://modifywatches.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">modifywatches.com</a> to see more. For this campaign, you can simply choose one of our best-sellers instead of a custom design.</li>

</div></div>","Meet the coolest watches on the block
 


 

 
Help us launch TWO styles of custom watches to be hand-assembled in San Francisco with your photos, logos or art! 

Modify's tagline is ""Show Your Colors"". We started as a project in 2010, and have grown into a brand with over 75,000 passionate fans on social media, and hundreds-of-thousands of watches sold through modifywatches.com. See some examples of our handiwork below:

The ""ModiFamily"" (our loyal customer base) has always been part of creating our products. They've named products, informed the launch of our 2nd style, and a few hundred have even contributed designs that we sell on on our site.
With your help, we can launch our first Round, fully-custom watches: the 30mm Rose Gold finish and the 40mm Gunmetal finish styles.

Through surveys, social media, and phone calls, they've asked for new styles and features: bigger and smaller; Gunmetal and Rose Gold finishes; square and round form factors. And of course, thinner, water-resistant, etc. We didn't think we could deliver one design that hit everyone's needs, which is why we are planning to launch TWO new styles if this Indiegogo campaign is successful!

Both styles, like all Modify Watches, will be available for 100% custom designs

images of kids and grandkids and cool cousins
photos of pets
company swag
designs from the nearly 1,000 artists and brands on our site
official watches from Major League Baseball, NHL, Foo Fighters, deadmau5 and more!

When funded, you'll be able to wear your passion on your wrist, no matter what you love.

There's a lot to love about these new styles

30mm Rose Gold Finish: Straps are 16mm wide and 8.75 inches long
40mm Gunmetal Finish: Straps are 20mm wide and 8.75 inches long
5ATM water-resistant (Go swimming!)
High-Quality Japan Movement
Interchangeable straps. Like all Modify Watches, you can mix-and-match to get different looks

Hand-assembled in San Francisco




Supporters will receive some pre-tty great perks

Significant discounts (up to 70% off!)
Some perks offer the opportunity to work with our Creative Team on unique designs. Most folks are not designers. Luckily Modify's Creative Team can help you bring your idea to life.
Hopefully a bit of happiness knowing that you're supporting job creation in a small business :)


 
 

 

 

 

To make this happen, we need $15,000. The number is actually a lot lower than any other production we've done because, well, this isn't our first rodeo. Did we mention we've been in business since 2010?

$15,000 will help fund


Tooling: the equipment on which our watches are made

Inventory: we need to buy a few thousand watches to get going

Customization Software: the DIY tool on our site so you can get any photo / design on your personalized watch. You can customize 3 styles on modifywatches.com/custom currently. If we hit our goal you'll be able to do it on the new round styles too!

Job Creation: This isn't a direct cost, but just know that you're helping to create jobs in San Francisco.



 
Also, this is a ""Fixed Funding"" project. If we don't hit $15,000, we're not taking a cent. We cannot launch these styles without your support. And folks might never be able to swap strap colors daily on round watches :)



Modify is a member of SFMade, and proud to hand-assemble our watches in San Francisco. With your support we'll be able to continue creating local jobs.
We also have partnered with nearly 1,000 artists, nonprofits, athletes, musicians, brands and other influencers. They sell their designs on our watches, and make money from this. By backing this campaign you also will be helping a bunch of nonprofits and other individuals. Below are just a sampling of our great partners. 

You can find all of our partners at modifywatches.com/collabs.

We've been running this company since 2010, with the goal of bringing joy to our customers. Our Net Promoter Score consistently hovers around 70 (that's really good), and you can see over 1,500 reviews of our service on our WOW wall. 
Point is, it's not just our families who trust us. If you're still not sure, check out our Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter communities. Or Google us and see some of the press we've had, and the huge brands that have chosen to work with us!




The 30mm and 40mm watches will be the 5th and 6th lines that we've launched (old fans will remember the ""Classic"" size). We've already worked with our factory to create prototypes, determine the cost of tooling, and understand pricing-per-watch.
We decided to do a fixed funding campaign because we know that $15,000 will enable us to launch these two products. Hopefully, from reading reviews of our company and seeing the passion from our community, you'll know that we're not just fundraising to ""launch a new product""; we're WAY more invested in maintaining the love from our fans. 
The one significant risk we foresee is that our timeline to deliver might lag (most perks have a June, July or August delivery). Our internal goal is to deliver all watches by May, but we wanted to account for shipping delays. Turns out that there is a *bit* of news on the trade front, if you haven't seen the press lately ...


We are not a charity, and are not asking for donations. We know that not everyone can afford to support - and that some of you just don't want a sweet custom watch. 
Our hope, though, is that you'll share our story with friends, family and coworkers who *might* be interested. 
Folks who wear a watch check it 10+ times / day ... we hope that they'll be extremely happy when they do so.
Please Share!




Where is Modify located? San Francisco

When were you founded? 2010!

What do you mean ""CUSTOM""? Thanks for asking! In the same way that you can put pretty much anything on a t-shirt, we believe that you should be able to wear a timepiece that has exactly what you want on it. So we offer custom watches where you can upload a photo or any art you want.

Are these gold? No, the watches aren't gold! The Rose Gold is a finish, not the full material. We wanted to make sure that you could get a great custom watch at a price you can afford.

What if I'm not creative? We also have thousands (seriously) of designs from the Modify Creative Team as well as hundreds of artists. Check out modifywatches.com to see more. For this campaign, you can simply choose one of our best-sellers instead of a custom design.",34.0,0,"2 Campaigns

   My name is <a href=""http://www.peggy-martinez.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peggy Martinez</a> and I'm the founder of Lit-CUBE. Lit-CUBE was an idea born out of mine &amp; my  14 year old son's love of monthly subscription boxes. We love getting our ""surprise"" packages each month, the anticipation is almost unbearable as we open them up to see what awesome (&amp; usually geeky) haul we get! We get gamer gear, nerd gear, horror gear, and super cool fandom items each and every month, BUT one thing we don't get and we wanted to add to our obsessions is BOOK gear! Sadly, we couldn't find a monthly book subscription box that made us want to do the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS1cLOIxsQ8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carlton</a>. :( <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1138503/files/20150108122011-carlton.gif?1420748411"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Thus was born Lit-CUBE, the only box of its kind. A subscription box for the reader and writer in all of us!<br/>   As a hybrid author (indie &amp; traditionally published) &amp; as the founder of <a href=""http://www.indiebookfestcon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Indie Bookfest</a>, I have made a lot of contacts in the Indie author &amp; book community. More importantly, I have made a lot of true friends &amp; I have learned a LOT about doing what it takes to make my dreams a reality. One of those dreams is to see people fall in love with Lit-CUBE &amp; as a result fall even more in love with reading and writing. (Is that even possible?!?) I've already made contact with some AMAZING artists, authors, &amp; entrepreneurs who will be partnering with Lit-CUBE to make our reader subscription boxes the envy of every book lover out there. I want to keep all the products a surprise, but I will give you this little tid-bit of info: We already have a book picked &amp; negotiated for the first Lit-CUBE... not only that, but we have all the products chosen and ready to be purchased and it is going to ROCK your SOCKS! <br/>   I'm hoping that everyone will read about this campaign and just get that warm and fuzzy feeling that *I* get when I think about it. One &lt;or&gt; TWO surprise books in each and every Cube, each and every month. WHAT!?! A themed cube each month. That's right! You'll know what the theme is each month before they are launched into the world, but waiting until they arrive and you get to open the cube without having *any* clue about what you'll find inside?!? THAT'S the fun part! <br/><br/>

Lit-CUBE was an idea born out of mine & my  14 year old son's love of monthly subscription boxes. We love getting our ""surprise"" packages each month, the anticipation is almost unbearable as we open them up to see what awesome (& usually geeky) haul we get! We get gamer gear, nerd gear, horror gear, and super cool fandom items each and every month, BUT one thing we don't get and we wanted to add to our obsessions is BOOK gear! Sadly, we couldn't find a monthly book subscription box that made us want to do the Carlton. :( 
Thus was born Lit-CUBE, the only box of its kind. A subscription box for the reader and writer in all of us!   As a hybrid author (indie & traditionally published) & as the founder of Indie Bookfest, I have made a lot of contacts in the Indie author & book community. More importantly, I have made a lot of true friends & I have learned a LOT about doing what it takes to make my dreams a reality. One of those dreams is to see people fall in love with Lit-CUBE & as a result fall even more in love with reading and writing. (Is that even possible?!?) I've already made contact with some AMAZING artists, authors, & entrepreneurs who will be partnering with Lit-CUBE to make our reader subscription boxes the envy of every book lover out there. I want to keep all the products a surprise, but I will give you this little tid-bit of info: We already have a book picked & negotiated for the first Lit-CUBE... not only that, but we have all the products chosen and ready to be purchased and it is going to ROCK your SOCKS!    I'm hoping that everyone will read about this campaign and just get that warm and fuzzy feeling that *I* get when I think about it. One <or> TWO surprise books in each and every Cube, each and every month. WHAT!?! A themed cube each month. That's right! You'll know what the theme is each month before they are launched into the world, but waiting until they arrive and you get to open the cube without having *any* clue about what you'll find inside?!? THAT'S the fun part! 

So, how does Lit-CUBE work?
Easy Peasy, Lemon Squeezy! Check it out:
1. Join Lit-Cube by subscribing! 

2. Wait while we fill your CUBE with all sorts of awesome, reader-inspired products. Every Lit-CUBE is guaranteed to include TWO books & other high quality items, hand-picked to delight your inner bookworm. Every subscriber will get $40+ worth of great products at a low price of $25. ($18/Cube + $7 s/h)


3. Try not to stalk your mail man while your Lit-CUBE is on its way. Once it gets there, jump up & down in book-geekery delight & then enjoy your bounty!

<p><strong>   What is Kombinova? : Kombinova is a fashion platform that's mostly appealing to women who is indecisive when it comes to buying clothes, accessories or cosmetics and aims to fix this problem.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>   For example;  a friend of yours has entered to a mall and she will buy a dress but she is torn between 3 different choices.Even though she has some friends with her, she can't get enough suggestions. Our friend vacillates. </strong></p>

<p><strong>   She can take pictures of those 3 different clothes and upload them on Kombinova with a  message. Within a couple of minutes, hundreds of people vote for it  and they can also comment on it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>    Thus our friend's problem of indecision would be fixed.</strong></p>

<p><strong>   In Kombinova  you may get folowers and you can  interact with other members.  You gain Fashion Point by voting photos on the platform or commenting on them.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>   You get your access to VIP rooms like Bronze, Silver, Golden and Dimond depending on your membership level.

<h2>Once you use LACED 4 GOOD™ on
your shoes, you will discover a new twist…(pun intended) in your daily routine.</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We don’t have any famous celebrity
endorsements (YET) but are fairly certain most of them wear shoes and would
benefit tremendously from LACED 4 GOOD™.  The
endorsements we do have are from family and friends that have tried LACED
4 GOOD™ and found them to do everything and even more than what they
expected.  Everyone is amazed at how such a simple device can perform the
way it does.</p>
<p>  Shoes are an essential part of our daily
lives.  On a typical day we put on a pair
of shoes in the morning: tie them.  Untie
the shoes and take them off after work or school.  Put on another pair of more comfortable shoes
(tie them) to run, play or exercise in during the afternoon.  Untie the shoes to take them off when we come
in for dinner.  Put on shoes (and tie
them) after dinner to go for a walk. 
Stop at a neighbor’s house to visit and take the shoes off (untie them
first of course) when you enter their home. 
Put the shoes back on (tie them again) when you are ready to go
home.  Untie and take the shoes off again
when you return home for the evening. 
The point is that we spend a lot of time putting on and tying shoes and
then untying and taking off the very same shoes each and every day.  </p>
<p>The process of sitting or bending
and fumbling around with laces to tie or untie shoes is a routine that is
uncomfortable for many and actually painful for some.  There are a few products on the market that
do a pretty good job of securing shoes or shoe laces but they do it in a way
that always keeps the shoes tight.  You
need to use a shoe horn to forcibly put on shoes that are tied tight and even
with the help of a shoe horn it is sometimes very difficult to get them on.  Tightly laced shoes are also very hard to get
off.  </p>
<p>Fortunately for all of us there
is a brand new product that will save us time &amp; effort and make routine tying
and untying shoes a thing of the past. LACED
4 GOOD™ is simply designed to be simple to use.</p>
<p></p>

<p>
</p>
<p>I am honored to present to the Indiegogo
community, LACED 4 GOOD™ which will tie (tighten) and untie (loosen) the laces
on almost any shoe with a simple pull and twist action.  LACED 4 GOOD™ is a single piece patent
pending system that simply slips over the laces on each shoe and provides full tension
adjustment from loose to snug and gives you total control of the tightness and
comfort settings you desire.  There are
no tools needed to adjust the fit.</p>
<p>If you wish to use the loop style
configuration, you will need to prepare your shoes to accept the LACED 4 GOOD™
lace link.  First you will need to
slightly rearrange the laces on your shoes. 
Pull the lace back out of the top two eyelets (two on each side of the
tongue).  Then reinsert the lace from the
underside of the second eyelet up through and into the top side of the first
eyelet.  Pull the lace down through the
first eyelet and pull it snug.  Do the
same thing with the lace and the eyelets on the other side of the tongue.  This new lace arrangement makes a very
convenient loop between the first and second eyelets that we will use later.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/7dCpak2urkI?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>The
loop style configuration is just one of many ways your shoe and shoe laces can
be arranged to work with LACED 4 GOOD™.<span> 
In most cases LACED 4 GOOD™ will even work with existing shoe lace
configurations so you won’t need to change a thing.  </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/162501/files/20131029172352-DSC02133.JPG?1383092632"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>There are no limits to the shoe
lacing variations that will work with LACED 4 GOOD™.  You can use your own style of creativity to
design functional and attractive shoe lace works of art.</p>
<p>To install LACED 4 GOOD™, simply
loosen your shoe laces to a comfortable setting that allows you to easily
remove and put on the shoe.  Then feed
the lace ends through the corresponding holes on each end of the LACED 4 GOOD™
lace link and slide it over the laces down to the shoe until it rests on the
eyelets near the tongue of the shoe.  You
may want to leave a little slack in the laces at this point but you can always
go back and re-adjust the lace link later. 
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/162504/files/20131029172522-DSC02146.JPG?1383092722"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link has
multiple holes in it to permit adjustment to the range of tightness you would
like on the shoe and to determine if you want to use conventional bows or go
with a bowless look.  You can weave the
lace through all the holes on each side of the lace link or decide what
combination of laces and holes works best for you.  If the laces are placed in the outer holes
first, there will be a greater amount of “take-up” on the laces and the shoe laces
will stay tighter after the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link is turned into place.  The
outside holes give the greatest variation from loose to tight and many people
prefer this type of fit style.  If the
holes closer to the middle of the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link are used, there will
be slightly less “take-up” on the laces and the shoe will be a little less snug
when the LACED 4 GOOD™ is turned into
place. </p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5oL7d7MX7ik?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>With the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link fully
laced, the laces can then be tied together with a double knot bow (for the very
last time) if you wish to give the shoes a traditional bow look on top of the
lace link. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/162505/files/20131029172900-Cropped_shoe2.jpg?1383092940"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Or the laces can be inserted down
into the center set of holes on the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link and be knotted
together on the underside to give the shoe a clean sleek look with no bow.  A few drops of glue on the knot will
guarantee it will never come loose.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/162507/files/20131029172959-DSC01804.JPG?1383092999"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You may have to tweak the tension
a time or two to get the comfortable fit you want but in the end it will be
worth it. Also, the ends of the LACED 4
GOOD™ lace link are intentionally left a little long to allow you to trim them
to a convenient, comfortable length. 
Simply cut off the excess with a pair of scissors if you wish. </p>
<p>To “tie” your shoes simply grip
the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link, pull out/up from the shoe and you will see and
feel the laces begin to tighten.  Twist 180
degrees (a half circle either way) to take up the slack in the laces and then slip
each end of the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link into the loops previously made with the
shoe laces. Or if you want the lace link to be hidden, slide the LACED 4 GOOD™
lace link under the laces on top of the shoe tongue.  This process takes about two seconds.</p>
<p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPw7_gSfk6I?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>

<p><br/><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To “untie” your shoe simply grip
the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link, apply a little pressure (force) either right or
left and one end of the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link will come out of the shoe lace
loop or out from under the laces.  Pull
the other side free and let the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link “untwist” and your shoe
will be loose enough to easily take off. 
This process also takes about two seconds.</p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEXs-xDCkWY?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For shoes and boots higher than
dress shoes, an easy and effective way to achieve the comfortable fit you want
is to use more than one set of LACED 4 GOOD™ lace links.  Each set will tighten and loosen the lace
area directly in the part of the shoe where it is placed.  We recommend two sets of LACED 4 GOOD™ for ankle high shoes, three sets of LACED 4
GOOD™ for 8” boots and four or more sets
of LACED 4 GOOD™ for boots 10”  or higher. 
Multiple sets of LACED 4 GOOD™ lace links are installed in the same
manner as described above by unlacing and making shoe lace loops for the LACED
4 GOOD™ lace links to be inserted into. 
In some cases, the existing shoe laces may be a little too short.  You may wish to use several lengths of
shorter laces to allow the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace links to work by tightening the
boot in independent segments.  For
example an 8” boot would have three shoe lace segments which would be tightened
or loosened independent of the others. 
You can choose the best arrangement that works on your shoes or boots.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/162518/files/20131029173733-DSC02247.JPG?1383093453"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Bow or No Bow?  Many people like the traditional look of
shoes with a properly tied bow and LACED 4 GOOD™ can provide this traditional
look while remaining fully functional. 
There has also been a trend lately to eliminate the traditional bow and
go with a No Bow sleek looking shoe and LACED 4 GOOD™ can provide this new look also.  LACED 4 GOOD™ can provide the No Bow look but
with many more interesting options.  A child’s
name, shoe charm, team logo, product logo, company name, bright color, flashing
lights or any other decoration that the creative LACED 4 GOOD™ owner can dream up, can be easily applied to LACED
4 GOOD™.  We don’t currently produce any
decorations for or customization of LACED 4 GOOD™ but we do encourage inspired
designers and artists to think of all the possibilities and perhaps even launch
a campaign using creative designs, artwork and decorations using LACED 4 GOOD™ as
the foundation or “canvas” for their creative expressions.  We will be producing a page on our website ( <a href=""http://www.laced4good.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.laced4good.com</a> ) dedicated to showing
off the creativity of LACED 4 GOOD™ users. 
Please visit the site and share your ideas.</p>

</p>
<p>We think you will be pleased and
impressed at how easily and quickly LACED 4 GOOD™ works for you.  It has never been easier to get in and out of
your shoes.</p>
<p><b>WE ARE NOT DONE YET!</b></p>
<p>As we have demonstrated, LACED 4
GOOD™ does a fantastic job of tying (tightening) and untying (loosening) your
shoes.  But did you notice that your
shoes can be tied and untied USING ONLY ONE HAND?  This feature alone makes LACED 4 GOOD™ one of
the most useful tools ever designed.  For
many people, the act of tying shoes is difficult and in some cases downright
painful.  The simple pull and twist
motion of LACED 4 GOOD™ could make starting the day for some people just a
little easier.</p>
<p><b>YES, THERE IS EVEN
MORE!</b></p>
<p>The simple pull and twist motion
of LACED 4 GOOD™ motivated us to use this convenient feature to help even more
people.  We have designed a very simple
accessory that can be used with LACED 4 GOOD™ to allow the user to operate the
pull and twist motions from a distance! 
Yes, that means by installing LACED 4 GOOD™ on your shoes and when using
this accessory, you can tie and untie your shoes WITHOUT BENDING OVER!!  This accessory is approximately 36” long and
permits you to simply grip the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link securely, pull, twist
and slide it into the loops on your shoe while standing or sitting upright. At this stage of development, it is not the
most glamorous tool or accessory, but it does work and work well.  It will take a little practice to get really
good at tying (tightening) your shoes from a distance but when you get it, you
will be doing something nobody else has done before.  With a little more practice, you will even be
able to use this accessory with one hand. 
We make the handles one length (long) and for now, the user can use this
tool as is or cut the handles shorter to a more convenient length.  After this Indiegogo project is completed, we
intend to enhance the design and performance of this unique tool so stay in
touch.</p>

</b></p>
<p><b><b>What we need the money for:</b> 
We will use the funds to pay for the injection molding tooling that will
allow us to produce enough LACED 4 GOOD™ for everyone.</b></p>
<b>





Challenges:</b><span> 
</span>The challenge will be getting the word out about our innovative new product
and convincing the Indiegogo community to participate. I have seen a lot of really
incredible projects here and getting the attention needed for a successful
campaign will be challenging, so I'm asking everyone, from family, old friends,
new friends, the Indiegogo community and “American Dreamers” everywhere to
spread the word. If you tell ten friends and they each tell ten friends and so
on, this project will be a huge success. <p></p>
<p>When it comes to fulfillment, every project
has potential obstacles and challenges. Obtaining materials, getting the
injection molding dies built and delivered on schedule are among them.<span>  We will be using a local manufacturer that we
have worked with for many years and he has been extremely reliable and
cooperative and always produces high quality parts so the risk is minimal.  Some projects are sent “offshore” from the
moment of conception but our  project was
imagined, designed, tested and will be made right here in the Great Lakes Bay area
of Michigan, U.S.A.  </span>We have a wide variety of first
class Manufactures in our area.<span>  Their
vast knowledge and experience makes it easy to turn a dream into a reality.</span></p>
<p>Another challenge is the high cost of
shipping LACED 4 GOOD™ to you.<span>  Our
product is designed to be economical, efficient and effective and as a result
of these efforts has a very low price. The packaging and shipping cost is often
more expensive than the product itself. 
We will do our best to find a way to get LACED 4 GOOD™ to you using the
most affordable method.</span></p>
<p>LACED 4 GOOD™ works on most laced shoes with eyelets
on either side of the shoe tongue up to 3” apart. Some styles of track shoes and boots are much
wider than regular shoes and for this start up we don’t currently plan to make
a version to fit exceptionally wide shoes.</p>

The LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link has
multiple holes in it to permit adjustment to the range of tightness you would
like on the shoe and to determine if you want to use conventional bows or go
with a bowless look.  You can weave the
lace through all the holes on each side of the lace link or decide what
combination of laces and holes works best for you.  If the laces are placed in the outer holes
first, there will be a greater amount of “take-up” on the laces and the shoe laces
will stay tighter after the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link is turned into place.  The
outside holes give the greatest variation from loose to tight and many people
prefer this type of fit style.  If the
holes closer to the middle of the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link are used, there will
be slightly less “take-up” on the laces and the shoe will be a little less snug
when the LACED 4 GOOD™ is turned into
place. 



With the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link fully
laced, the laces can then be tied together with a double knot bow (for the very
last time) if you wish to give the shoes a traditional bow look on top of the
lace link. 

Or the laces can be inserted down
into the center set of holes on the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link and be knotted
together on the underside to give the shoe a clean sleek look with no bow.  A few drops of glue on the knot will
guarantee it will never come loose.

You may have to tweak the tension
a time or two to get the comfortable fit you want but in the end it will be
worth it. Also, the ends of the LACED 4
GOOD™ lace link are intentionally left a little long to allow you to trim them
to a convenient, comfortable length. 
Simply cut off the excess with a pair of scissors if you wish. 
To “tie” your shoes simply grip
the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link, pull out/up from the shoe and you will see and
feel the laces begin to tighten.  Twist 180
degrees (a half circle either way) to take up the slack in the laces and then slip
each end of the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link into the loops previously made with the
shoe laces. Or if you want the lace link to be hidden, slide the LACED 4 GOOD™
lace link under the laces on top of the shoe tongue.  This process takes about two seconds.





To “untie” your shoe simply grip
the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link, apply a little pressure (force) either right or
left and one end of the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link will come out of the shoe lace
loop or out from under the laces.  Pull
the other side free and let the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link “untwist” and your shoe
will be loose enough to easily take off. 
This process also takes about two seconds.



For shoes and boots higher than
dress shoes, an easy and effective way to achieve the comfortable fit you want
is to use more than one set of LACED 4 GOOD™ lace links.  Each set will tighten and loosen the lace
area directly in the part of the shoe where it is placed.  We recommend two sets of LACED 4 GOOD™ for ankle high shoes, three sets of LACED 4
GOOD™ for 8” boots and four or more sets
of LACED 4 GOOD™ for boots 10”  or higher. 
Multiple sets of LACED 4 GOOD™ lace links are installed in the same
manner as described above by unlacing and making shoe lace loops for the LACED
4 GOOD™ lace links to be inserted into. 
In some cases, the existing shoe laces may be a little too short.  You may wish to use several lengths of
shorter laces to allow the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace links to work by tightening the
boot in independent segments.  For
example an 8” boot would have three shoe lace segments which would be tightened
or loosened independent of the others. 
You can choose the best arrangement that works on your shoes or boots.

Bow or No Bow?  Many people like the traditional look of
shoes with a properly tied bow and LACED 4 GOOD™ can provide this traditional
look while remaining fully functional. 
There has also been a trend lately to eliminate the traditional bow and
go with a No Bow sleek looking shoe and LACED 4 GOOD™ can provide this new look also.  LACED 4 GOOD™ can provide the No Bow look but
with many more interesting options.  A child’s
name, shoe charm, team logo, product logo, company name, bright color, flashing
lights or any other decoration that the creative LACED 4 GOOD™ owner can dream up, can be easily applied to LACED
4 GOOD™.  We don’t currently produce any
decorations for or customization of LACED 4 GOOD™ but we do encourage inspired
designers and artists to think of all the possibilities and perhaps even launch
a campaign using creative designs, artwork and decorations using LACED 4 GOOD™ as
the foundation or “canvas” for their creative expressions.  We will be producing a page on our website ( www.laced4good.com ) dedicated to showing
off the creativity of LACED 4 GOOD™ users. 
Please visit the site and share your ideas.



We think you will be pleased and
impressed at how easily and quickly LACED 4 GOOD™ works for you.  It has never been easier to get in and out of
your shoes.
WE ARE NOT DONE YET!
As we have demonstrated, LACED 4
GOOD™ does a fantastic job of tying (tightening) and untying (loosening) your
shoes.  But did you notice that your
shoes can be tied and untied USING ONLY ONE HAND?  This feature alone makes LACED 4 GOOD™ one of
the most useful tools ever designed.  For
many people, the act of tying shoes is difficult and in some cases downright
painful.  The simple pull and twist
motion of LACED 4 GOOD™ could make starting the day for some people just a
little easier.
YES, THERE IS EVEN
MORE!
The simple pull and twist motion
of LACED 4 GOOD™ motivated us to use this convenient feature to help even more
people.  We have designed a very simple
accessory that can be used with LACED 4 GOOD™ to allow the user to operate the
pull and twist motions from a distance! 
Yes, that means by installing LACED 4 GOOD™ on your shoes and when using
this accessory, you can tie and untie your shoes WITHOUT BENDING OVER!!  This accessory is approximately 36” long and
permits you to simply grip the LACED 4 GOOD™ lace link securely, pull, twist
and slide it into the loops on your shoe while standing or sitting upright. At this stage of development, it is not the
most glamorous tool or accessory, but it does work and work well.  It will take a little practice to get really
good at tying (tightening) your shoes from a distance but when you get it, you
will be doing something nobody else has done before.  With a little more practice, you will even be
able to use this accessory with one hand. 
We make the handles one length (long) and for now, the user can use this
tool as is or cut the handles shorter to a more convenient length.  After this Indiegogo project is completed, we
intend to enhance the design and performance of this unique tool so stay in
touch.





What we need the money for: 
We will use the funds to pay for the injection molding tooling that will
allow us to produce enough LACED 4 GOOD™ for everyone.






Challenges: 
The challenge will be getting the word out about our innovative new product
and convincing the Indiegogo community to participate. I have seen a lot of really
incredible projects here and getting the attention needed for a successful
campaign will be challenging, so I'm asking everyone, from family, old friends,
new friends, the Indiegogo community and “American Dreamers” everywhere to
spread the word. If you tell ten friends and they each tell ten friends and so
on, this project will be a huge success. 
When it comes to fulfillment, every project
has potential obstacles and challenges. Obtaining materials, getting the
injection molding dies built and delivered on schedule are among them.  We will be using a local manufacturer that we
have worked with for many years and he has been extremely reliable and
cooperative and always produces high quality parts so the risk is minimal.  Some projects are sent “offshore” from the
moment of conception but our  project was
imagined, designed, tested and will be made right here in the Great Lakes Bay area
of Michigan, U.S.A.  We have a wide variety of first
class Manufactures in our area.  Their
vast knowledge and experience makes it easy to turn a dream into a reality.
Another challenge is the high cost of
shipping LACED 4 GOOD™ to you.  Our
product is designed to be economical, efficient and effective and as a result
of these efforts has a very low price. The packaging and shipping cost is often
more expensive than the product itself. 
We will do our best to find a way to get LACED 4 GOOD™ to you using the
most affordable method.
LACED 4 GOOD™ works on most laced shoes with eyelets
on either side of the shoe tongue up to 3” apart. Some styles of track shoes and boots are much
wider than regular shoes and for this start up we don’t currently plan to make
a version to fit exceptionally wide shoes.
