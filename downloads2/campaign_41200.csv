<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi Everybody,</p>
<p>we are people who cares about the environment and we are very sensible about the problem of plastic in our oceans and as one of the most source of waste.</p>
<p>One day during a typical dinner with friends we asked us a question:</p>
<p>what if a lot of people avoid single-use plastic for one week? how much plastic we can save?</p>
<p>From it the distance of 'No Plastic Game' challenge is very short</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need money to found the legal society, make a website and do some marketing to increase our visibility. More people join our movement, more plastic we can save!!</li>
<li>We want to create a strong global community, all the decision will be made together. </li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will use the money reached for the original intent and we'll add extra work to implement where we failed  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of our campaign is very simple:</p>
<p>solve one of the most dangerous problem of the last years!</p>
<ul>
<li>our project is valuable  to you  and to the world because the problem of the waste is global. Some cities and government are studying some law to delete the disposable plastic from the daily life. Don't get caught unprepared</li>
<li>With all the contributors and participants we can see our dream come true</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We don't have critical risks, because at this stage we don't sel nothing and we don't have manufacturing process.</p>
<p>We have a 9 am-18pm office work, we'll implement all the data in our free time, maybe we'll go long to give back to the participants the results! It depends from how many challenger we'll have. </p>
<p>We are happy if there is a lot of work to do, it means that many will have decided to participate !!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, no problem, we appreciate the time you've spent with us and maybe you can talk about it  to your friends, family or office if you know someone who can be interested!!</p>

We need money to found the legal society, make a website and do some marketing to increase our visibility. More people join our movement, more plastic we can save!!
We want to create a strong global community, all the decision will be made together. 
If we don't reach our entire goal, we will use the money reached for the original intent and we'll add extra work to implement where we failed  


The Impact
The impact of our campaign is very simple:
solve one of the most dangerous problem of the last years!

our project is valuable  to you  and to the world because the problem of the waste is global. Some cities and government are studying some law to delete the disposable plastic from the daily life. Don't get caught unprepared
With all the contributors and participants we can see our dream come true


Risks & Challenges

A part of our business is ocean awareness by getting people involved in scuba diving. Scuba divers are the ones who make a difference for our oceans. We not only get to see amazingly wonderful things underwater, but we also get to see some problems there too. Trash and conservation issues can be corrected by scuba divers since it is the divers who get to see first hand what is happening beneath the surface. Scuba certification costs are typically around $350-$500 dollars. Not everyone can afford this, which is why we are running this campaign. We believe that teaching people how to scuba dive helps our oceans and we want to be able to get more people involved in scuba diving for FREE. No one gets to see and contribute more to our oceans than scuba divers. Since it is the scuba divers who can make the biggest difference, we feel it is necessary to get more people into this amazing sport. When trash gets picked up underneath the water, it is by scuba divers. When animals are rescued from trash, debris, and structure beneath the water, it is by scuba divers. Donate today and when we meet our goal you will be able to try scuba diving for free anytime for the whole year of 2015. This means you will go on a guided scuba diving tour and learn to dive with a certified instructor for FREE while learning about Ocean Awareness.</span></span><br/>
</h3>
<div>We need to raise $225,000 to be able to conduct guided scuba diving tours for FREE for a whole year, teach ocean awareness, and conduct/teach/conduct underwater clean ups. If we do not meet our goal, ALL of the funds will be donated to the non profit Ocean Awareness.</div>
</div><div>We took over 700 people diving last year. Check out some of our pictures and videos of our diving and our operations of saving sea animals at DivingPCB.com. We hope you will donate and we also hope that we will see you this year, ready to scuba dive.</div><div>Our oceans are in trouble, whether people want to believe it or not. If we don't act now, our future generations will not be happy with us. I always think to myself, what will our future generations think of us when they realize that our ocean is dying and it was all caused by our generation not caring, or acting (doing nothing). I hope that our people in the future can enjoy the oceans as we have. The more people we get involved in scuba diving, the better chance our ocean will have at surviving continued generations.</div><div>Hope to see you soon.</div><div>Mike Luttrell<br/>DivingPCB.com<br/>

We believe that teaching people how to scuba dive helps our oceans and we want to be able to get more people involved in scuba diving for FREE. No one gets to see and contribute more to our oceans than scuba divers. Since it is the scuba divers who can make the biggest difference, we feel it is necessary to get more people into this amazing sport. When trash gets picked up underneath the water, it is by scuba divers. When animals are rescued from trash, debris, and structure beneath the water, it is by scuba divers. Donate today and when we meet our goal you will be able to try scuba diving for free anytime for the whole year of 2015. This means you will go on a guided scuba diving tour and learn to dive with a certified instructor for FREE while learning about Ocean Awareness.

We need to raise $225,000 to be able to conduct guided scuba diving tours for FREE for a whole year, teach ocean awareness, and conduct/teach/conduct underwater clean ups. If we do not meet our goal, ALL of the funds will be donated to the non profit Ocean Awareness.
We took over 700 people diving last year. Check out some of our pictures and videos of our diving and our operations of saving sea animals at DivingPCB.com. We hope you will donate and we also hope that we will see you this year, ready to scuba dive.Our oceans are in trouble, whether people want to believe it or not. If we don't act now, our future generations will not be happy with us. I always think to myself, what will our future generations think of us when they realize that our ocean is dying and it was all caused by our generation not caring, or acting (doing nothing). I hope that our people in the future can enjoy the oceans as we have. The more people we get involved in scuba diving, the better chance our ocean will have at surviving continued generations.Hope to see you soon.Mike LuttrellDivingPCB.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Sea pollution occurs when harmful effects result from the entry into the ocean of chemicals, particles, industrial, agricultural, and residential waste, noise, or the spread of invasive organisms. Eighty percent of sea pollution comes from land. Air pollution is also a contributing factor by carrying off pesticides or dirt into the ocean. Land and air pollution have proven to be harmful to marine life and its habitats.</p>
<p>The pollution often comes from nonpoint sources such as agricultural runoff, wind-blown debris, and dust. Nutrient pollution, a form of water pollution, refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients. It is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters, in which excess nutrients, usually nitrates or phosphates, stimulate algae growth. Many potentially toxic chemicals adhere to tiny particles which are then taken up by plankton and benthic animals, most of which are either deposit feeders or filter feeders. In this way, the toxins are concentrated upward within ocean food chains. Many particles combine chemically in a manner highly depletive of oxygen, causing estuaries to become anoxic.</p>
<p>When pesticides are incorporated into the marine ecosystem, they quickly become absorbed into marine food webs. Once in the food webs, these pesticides can cause mutations, as well as diseases, which can be harmful to humans as well as the entire food web. Toxic metals can also be introduced into marine food webs. These can cause a change to tissue matter, biochemistry, behaviour, reproduction, and suppress growth in marine life. Also, many animal feeds have a high fish meal or fish hydrolysatecontent. In this way, marine toxins can be transferred to land animals, and appear later in meat and dairy products.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Oakheart Farm, a sustainable intentional community in Virginia, has been selected as a Glass Explorer. We want to use Glass to educate people about permaculture and sustainability, as we take an old, neglected family farm and revitalize it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to use Glass:</p>
<ul>
<li>to live-stream when we're shearing our alpacas, harvesting our crops, and working the farm</li>
<li>to show our successes and our failures so that eeryone can learn from our experience</li>
<li>to fulfill our goal of becoming an educational organization and freely share what we've learned</li>
</ul>
<p>We need $5000 to pay for the Google Glass device, and to make the trip to New York to the Google service center to pick it up and get trained in its use. This funding will cover the actual cost of the device and the travel expenses for two of our people to drive to New York and back, which we project to take three days, two for the travel and one for the Google service center visit.</p>
<p>We're using the Fixed Funding model, so if we don't get fully funded, all contributions will be returned and we get nothing. If we go over our funding goal, we'll add stretch items!</p>
<p>See the Perks for the rewards at each level of funding contribution. We will be sending out farm products, one of a kind custom made items, and providing an onsite experience as part of the reward structure. </p>
<p>Each level of reward includes all the levels below, with the exception of the sample kit, which already has everything in it.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our goal is to show people that you can remain connected to the world and still walk lightly on the Earth. We're going forward into a sustainable future, not back into a pre-Internet past.</p>
<p>Imagine watching over a farmer's shoulder in real time as livestock are tended. Do you want to know that the animals are being cared for humanely? Do you want to know that the chickens really are free range? Imagine a live camera on the farm, and the transparency that results.</p>
<p>Imagine joining a CSA, a Community Supported Agriculture food distribution. Once a month you get a box containing what the farm is currently harvesting. What's in it? It's a surprise. With Glass, we can show you what we're harvesting, show you the boxes as we're packing them, so you can do your menu planning before the box arrives.</p>
<p>Imagine going to the farmers' market and knowing what's going to be available before you get there.</p>
<p>You don't have to imagine. We're going to make it real.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that the economy is tight. We're farmers. But there's stuff you can do besides contribute to this funding campaign.</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy your produce at your local farmers' market. It doesn't have to be from us. Every purchase you make from a local farmer, anywhere, helps support community agriculture.</li>
<li>Find out more about permaculture at <a href=""http://permacultureprinciples.com/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://permacultureprinciples.com/index.php</a>.</li>
<li>Look into urban gardening. You can grow your own vegetables, compost your kitchen trash, and in some communities raise your own chickens.</li>
<li>Read Toby Hemenway's book <em>Gaia's Garden</em>, about how to set up a permaculture garden in your back yard.</li>
<li>Spread the word about our campaign. Tell people about our farm. The more the word gets out, the better a chance we'll have not only of funding this campaign, but of getting out our message, that it's possible to live in a sustainable way and still be part of the modern world.</li>

</div></div>","Introducing ACT ACT is a shopping app that advises you about the environmental and workers rights impact of products so that you can make the right decision for the planet and its people ACT helps you shop efficiently with regards to brand, location and price and if you want to it also gives you the full opportunity to choose the products that are sustainable for the environment and for human rights.A wealth of filters will allow you to search for certified organic, non-certified organic, non-GMO, nutritional information etc.    From your tomatoes to your apples, beer, meat - everything you need is categorized and information (certifications, reviews, ratings) is gathered for each brand.A bit like a review site, but with more science behind. This way a wealth of information is gathered in one place for your information, and for a global audience so you know you are not ACTing alone. In fact your actions together with 1000s of ACT users will make a big difference. Together we gather the data, we supply the science and your make the purchasing desision. This is possibly the first time a service connects and helps consumers globally know how their day-to-day grocery shopping affects the planet & the people and where the only metric for driving change is shown in real-time:""How much money is flowing to the sustainable companies through our combined purchasing power of sustainable products.""We assume that since you are visiting this campaign (thank you for that), you are already very well aware that our environment and equality has never been harder pressed with 4 out of 9 planetary boundaries already crossed - climate change is just one of them. If you are not aware of this please take a look at our Facebook page for inputs on this. See under ""About"" in the top for links.We have a vision and a goal to put all of us in the driver’s seat for shaping a sustainable future for us and our kids and as fast as we want to see that happen.We are now 3 months away from our first pilot and we ask for your help so that we can develop the last parts of our software and get to the market.With your help, our team will be able to finish development of the platform and get through our first pilot, granting you access to the best shopping tool, so that we can start buying back our future! We have been working with the ACT project for more than 2 years now and a lot of things have been accomplished including partnerships, testing and surveying of end users and retailers. The main milestones include:- Patent pending on our scalable rating system - Rating of 30.000 grocery products- Design of 2 apps that are now in development - Creation of possibly the biggest grocery category structure in the world - Signed letters of agreement with potential pilots. Our focus is on finishing the development of the shopping list app (shown in the videos) and to make sure it is an effective shopping tool that gives you a free and informed choice whether you are shopping for price, location, sustainability, transparency or a mix of these.We are also building a smart checkout app that can be used by small stores for handling your checkouts.With your help we will get faster to market and increase the quality of the product so that our first pilot becomes as solid as possible. Once we get to the pilot we will be fundraising again to fuel our growth phase so we can get out to as many as possible.We want to bring ACTion to you and the planet as fast as we can. To give you an idea about how much we can achieve in the near future, consider this : Our funding goal is 24,000 USD. Together with investors that can take us through our pilot and onto launch.Unfortunately, in our society today, one of the main drivers for change is money! How much is shifted, how fast and in what direction. ACT puts you and all the other ACT users in the driver’s seat for shifting money towards a sustainable future.The aim of this app is to create a GLOBAL collaboration platform around sustainable shopping to help solve some of the biggest problems facing the people and the planet today.Because this is a big task, the more money we have available the faster we will be able to reach that goal, and the less money we will need to take from investors, which in turn will give us more momentum.Our society is coming to a historic turning point in time. We cannot continue in the way we have previously.Help us make ACT possible, so we can buy back our future.Thank you for your help!   We are passionate about transparency and environmental sustainability. The majority of us are working on this project alongside our full time jobs, often working late into the evenings and into weekends because we believe in this project’s huge potential for creating a better world.The team is international, with more than 10 nationalities represented and expertise in a wide range of disciplines. We know each other well through working together on this project. The structure is flat which allows us to disagree openly about the direction of our project and we do not have any problems telling our Danish CEO when he is too crazy.  ACT exists as a Cooperative/Limited Company hybrid in Norway to make sure ACT is never distracted from its important work. This draws on the democratic strengths of being an employee-controlled organisation, but also benefits from the corporate advantages of a limited liability company Other ways you can helpIf you can’t contribute financially you can still help!- You can always spread the word and make some noise about our campaign.- Use the Indiegogo Share tools above to promote our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, etc.We deeply appreciate your support. Shout Out - 5 USDBe a part of ACT Hall of Fame in the App with a special mention thanking you.

<p><b>The specific objective of this campaign is to raise the initial funds to build and test the new 450hp HISCORE Engine which has been upscale designed from a lower powered engine model a proven technology concept. This funding will enable us to reach the pre-production milestone.</b></p>

The Introduction of our innovative HISCORE Engine will start the reverse of global pollution being caused by the internal combustion engine in all types of vehicles around the world. Particularly by heavy truck transport, a major global polluter  - we are starting our technology application roll-out in the heavy vehicle industry sector. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">With Earth's growing population consequently requiring the growth of the number of vehicles on roads therefore consequently increasing pollution - and with vehicle CO2 exhaust emissions highly contributing to global warming and climate change - <b>the HISCORE is an engine whose time has come = it effectively is a global pollution solution. </b></span></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">THE TECHNOLOGY</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The HiSCOrE, formost, is a ""High Torque, Silent, Closed-Cycle, Orbital Engine'. Unique steam-powered rotary engine technology. A new fuel-efficient and low-emissions technology = a climate friendly green engine.</span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""> </i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">I</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">t can be simply described as a closed-cycle external combustion engine with water as the working fluid. Being an external combustion engine (ECE) it is flexi-fuel, that is it can burn any fuel in its power plant (prime-power unit), liquid or gaseous, or a combination of both (dual fuel). The  external combustion engine is not a new technology concept, it is a long-proven and acceptable technology that has been around for a long time with applications in steam locomotives, steam turbine ship propulsion and steam turbine power generation. The HISCORE engine system is a micro-sized version with the difference that the efficient HISCORE engine (the prime-mover unit component) replaces the turbine component. It is scalable from palm size 8hp up to thousands of horsepower. <i>It can also uniquely function as an open-cycle high pressure direct injection (HPDI) engine with other than steam expansion fuels.</i></span></span></p>

<p>The HISCORE is a global impacting power and propulsion system for a diverse range of global market applications across land-based, maritime and aviation industries.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The purpose-designed HISCORE-1600 450hp engine is a generic power model that can be aftermarket (after purchase) retrofitted into the millions of heavy articulated trucks (these are the trucks that tow trailers, see photo below) now on the roads around the world (Internal combustion taken engine out, HISCORE Engine put in). <br/></p>

Being a silent running engine, 100% noise pollution reduction. The significant fuel cost savings make retrofitting a compelling investment take-up by truck owners = expedient implementation of HISCORE engines around the world. Fuel consumption savings of 60% = fuel cost savings 60% (dollar amount variable on pump fuel price) = HISCORE engine demand = emissions saving = healthier environment = smiley planet. For every litre of diesel fuel burn saved by HISCORE = a saving of 2.67kg or 22.2lbs per US gallon, of CO2, significant pollution savings when you apply 60% emissions savings to the amount of diesel consumed by the number of heavy trucks around the world. </span></p>

</div></div>","My name is Alan Thom. I am the co-founder and managing partner of the 'HISCORE Engine Project'. Walter Reed, my American partner, is co-founder and the owner of the HISCORE Engine intellectual property. Walter and I are the Principals of the Project. My role is Corporate and Commercial Affairs responsible for funding, and Walter is the Technical Director. The Project is a joint Australian-American partnership. I am the Creator and Owner of this Campaign.



THE HISCORE ENGINE PROJECT
The Project has been established for the development and global comercialization of the unique HISCORE Engine technology. A game changing  green, climate friendly, technology that will help make a greener Earth and preserve our planet for future generations. The HISCORE will be the future of engines with applications in all classes of vehicles.
The specific objective of this campaign is to raise the initial funds to build and test the new 450hp HISCORE Engine which has been upscale designed from a lower powered engine model a proven technology concept. This funding will enable us to reach the pre-production milestone.
OUR TECHNOLOGY OBJECTIVE AND IMPACT
Our aim is for our efficient low or zero emissions ""green"" HISCORE Engine technology to supersede the inefficient highly polluting internal combustion engine (ICE) in vehicles. The introduction will impact positively and beneficially on climate change. The Introduction of our innovative HISCORE Engine will start the reverse of global pollution being caused by the internal combustion engine in all types of vehicles around the world. Particularly by heavy truck transport, a major global polluter  - we are starting our technology application roll-out in the heavy vehicle industry sector. 
With Earth's growing population consequently requiring the growth of the number of vehicles on roads therefore consequently increasing pollution - and with vehicle CO2 exhaust emissions highly contributing to global warming and climate change - the HISCORE is an engine whose time has come = it effectively is a global pollution solution. 
THE TECHNOLOGY
The HiSCOrE, formost, is a ""High Torque, Silent, Closed-Cycle, Orbital Engine'. Unique steam-powered rotary engine technology. A new fuel-efficient and low-emissions technology = a climate friendly green engine. It can be simply described as a closed-cycle external combustion engine with water as the working fluid. Being an external combustion engine (ECE) it is flexi-fuel, that is it can burn any fuel in its power plant (prime-power unit), liquid or gaseous, or a combination of both (dual fuel). The  external combustion engine is not a new technology concept, it is a long-proven and acceptable technology that has been around for a long time with applications in steam locomotives, steam turbine ship propulsion and steam turbine power generation. The HISCORE engine system is a micro-sized version with the difference that the efficient HISCORE engine (the prime-mover unit component) replaces the turbine component. It is scalable from palm size 8hp up to thousands of horsepower. It can also uniquely function as an open-cycle high pressure direct injection (HPDI) engine with other than steam expansion fuels.

The HISCORE is a global impacting power and propulsion system for a diverse range of global market applications across land-based, maritime and aviation industries.


The purpose-designed HISCORE-1600 450hp engine is a generic power model that can be aftermarket (after purchase) retrofitted into the millions of heavy articulated trucks (these are the trucks that tow trailers, see photo below) now on the roads around the world (Internal combustion taken engine out, HISCORE Engine put in). 


In comparison with a 450hp ICE over the same route distance, the HISCORE-1600  will indicatively reduce diesel fuel consumption and therefore GHG/CO2 exhaust emissions reduction by better than 60%, better again with natural gas fuel, around +10%. Being a silent running engine, 100% noise pollution reduction. The significant fuel cost savings make retrofitting a compelling investment take-up by truck owners = expedient implementation of HISCORE engines around the world. Fuel consumption savings of 60% = fuel cost savings 60% (dollar amount variable on pump fuel price) = HISCORE engine demand = emissions saving = healthier environment = smiley planet. For every litre of diesel fuel burn saved by HISCORE = a saving of 2.67kg or 22.2lbs per US gallon, of CO2, significant pollution savings when you apply 60% emissions savings to the amount of diesel consumed by the number of heavy trucks around the world. 
Why Steam Power
When boiling water reaches 100C boiling point it turns into steam and expands 1600 times, the most of any medium known to man. The grandfather of thermodynamics, Carnot, proposed six conditions for a practical engine...he did not include efficiency. They were: (1) Safety (2) Solidity (3) DurabiIity (4) Compact (5) Low Cost (6) Fuel Economy. In today's world of harmful emissions, threat of runaway green house gas effect and finite reserves of fuel oil, we could change condition (6), surely with Carnot's approval, to Fuel Economy with Zero Emissions. For our ideal (HISCORE) engine in the 21st century, we could add a condition (7) Silent!
= The HISCORE Steam driven rotary piston displacement engine
Under our fuel development program we are working on both compressed air and liquid-air as a sustainable renewable energy fuel for HISCORE engine applications to deliver zero polluting exhaust emissions, only air. The HISCORE will also be tested with this expansion fuel power. The recent UN IPCC Report warned that we have to be weaned off fossil fuels by century end. The HISCORE air-fueled (gas or liquid) engine will contribute greatly to this and play its part for greening the Earth.



Key Attributes are:


Fuel consumption economy 
Emissions reduction (up to 100% - depending on fuel type)
Fuel cost economy
Flexi-Fuel capability

Silent running (like an electric vehicle)

<p></p><p></p></div>","Help everyone to play their part in tackling global warmingBe part of this important initiativeDo you know how much carbon the food you eat or grow captures?
The Problem
The world is heating up. The gas Carbon Dioxide is a
main contributor to global warming. 
Capturing carbon
reduces the thickening of the atmosphere, this helps reduce global warming.  Massive numbers of decisions are being made everyday in relation to food grown and eaten. (Approximately 40% of the world's population are farmers and all of the world's population eat food).The decisions about what is grown have an impact on the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and so impact global warming.Most people, however, are unable to access information on how much carbon fruits and vegetables emit, store & capture.Farmers, food gardeners and consumers are making decisions about fruits & vegetables every day.Various types of fruits and vegetables emit, capture & store carbon differently. The Solution 
The Allripe team is creating a free web-based Application that can calculate the amount of carbon captured by
growing fruits and vegetables. We call this the Carbon Capture Calculator. This
will enable growers to measure exactly how much carbon their produce is capturing & storing. Growers can more easily calculate which fruits & vegetables are capturing carbon the most effectively.We believe this is a great tool to empower anyone to create
positive changes for the environment.
You will be helping
many growers as well as the environment by supporting the Carbon Capture
Calculator.The Allripe team is creating a
carbon capture calculator that allows anyone growing food to measure how much
they are capturing and aggregate their capturing with others. This will enable
them to see exactly how they are helping the environment. This can also be used
as the basis of a database to help gain greater recognition of small scale
producers who are often overlooked in carbon capture. To accurately calculate the amount of carbon that is
captured, stored & emitted by fruit and vegetable producers, the calculator will need to consider over
50 factors.These factors will be
tied together by an algorithm developed by the Allripe team, which will then
produce an exact measure of the amount of carbon captured, emitted & stored. It is critical that growers understand the impact of the types of fruits & vegetables they are growing as well as the impact of their methods of growing.
This application will
allow you to share your progress with a group or a community. You can aggregate your “captured carbon” to see how much you and your group have captured. You can also set
targets and goals. You can also see how
people from different parts of the world are doing their part in reversing
their carbon footprint. This will provide meaningful data to growers and also to the wider community.
We
want to make this calculator as effective and easy to use as possible. This
should support & encourage people to make good decisions about growing fruits and vegetables. You can make a
difference
You can support this
campaign with contributions and we would also appreciate if you can get the
word out. The more people aware of what they can do to capture carbon the
better. We need $15,000 to
complete the work on the Carbon Capture Calculator. We have already developed
part of it and now need support to develop the rest so that it is ready to use.
So far our work has included: research, databases, modelling and coding. We
need additional funds to help make the Carbon Capture Calculator for Food Growers happen. Your support will be used for:* further modelling & database development * coding * rigorous testing* improving the user experienceGet recognition as a

I’m a social-entrepreneur who is risking it all to help the manifestation of a Revolutionary Project with altruistic purposes that does not overlook self-success.
Born in Colombia. Lived in the U.S. for 12 years during which I was able to experience many facets ~ from student, to corporate professional, to self-exploration.
Situation: Living out of credit-cards, staying at a Chez JJ - a camaraderie and idea-swapping hostel in Silicon Valley.
Challenge: Either make it OR go bankrupt.
Vision: A conglomerate non-profit business model that aims promote social-entrepreneurial solutions to the world’s greatest challenges.
Campaign’s brief description:  This campaign aims to be a catalytic agent for new ideals and impulses that once synthesize will empower each other mutually there by generating creative solutions to the world’s problems.
I feel this campaign to be my duty, I feel an urge to convey what I have seen as one of the most feasible opportunities to Unite and Change / Save the World.
By supporting this initial stage you would help me validate the acceptance hypothesis as well as giving us (you and me) the opportunity to share this common vision, get together and make it work!
You would also help me with my basic living expenses, minor technical support and to empower my enthusiasm by allowing me witness this seed grow.
Before you continue...
Given the multidimensional aspects of this project, please take a moment to watch the video :)
 
What We Need & What You Get
Given the magnitude of this project as well as its abstract concept I opted for dividing it in 3 stages:

Stage 1 Acceptance & Survival $10,000: Hypothesis testing, vision acceptance, survive, share, help volunteers and minor tech support investments. Fixed Funding (If goal is not met - money is returned) 
Stage 2 Materialization $30,000:  Team gathering, construct democratic online platform, drafting company laws, form non-profit corporation , real cost structure, official website and tech support.
Stage 3 Concrete Start $40,000:  Concrete plans and fundraising for starting partners.
This Stage Approach will allow you and me to validate the perpetuating effect that this company aims to cause. 
 
This is Stage 1 ~ A breaking point - The Chasm ~ Either the vision is understood, replicates and grows or it will help me to Get Real!
This is why it is a Fixed Campaign (If goal is Not met - Money is returned)
 
Detail - Stage Funding:
Since this is the First Stage, the Hypothesis Validation Stage, if $10,000 dollars are collected in 60 days, this would mean that people have understood the vision. It will mean that there is a replicating effect, that there is trust and hope. The money will be used as follows: 50% will be allocated towards survival expenses that I have and will incur by dedicating my entire energy to convey and spread this vision, 30% will be allocated to help reimburse expenses of people who decide to take part in this vision, and the remaining 20% of those funds will allow the project to pay for minor technical support like: web designer, and other methods to spread of our vision.
By the Second Stage 90 days, I envision that the company will have a small team of collaborators (All of you who resonate with the vision). At this point we will plead for an estimate of $30,000 that will go mainly toward paying for a physical location, all expenses that may be involved in the drafting of the laws of the corporation through an online democratic platform and legally forming the corporation. it will also try to alleviate as much as possible expenses incurred by people that is already part of the corporation as well as new comers. Another significant part of this capital will go to the development of an official website and other technical development.
By the Third Stage 120 days, there will be a concrete plan, detail cost structure, and great awareness about the project. By this time the company will be formed and a great collective energy as well as many possibilities will open up...  I estimated for this stage $40,000 but it might be less or not even necessary :)
 
Perks:
If you contributed, that means that something in you resonated with this vision. 
Your contributions will count as credits when you decide to jump aboard or you can support someone else's idea by donating your credits. 
You may or not have a business idea yet, but now you know that there will be a matrix that will be able support your business ideas through this empowering circle of capital. So get ready, get involved so that once this project materializes, you can use those credits, create your own company and change the world doing what you like doing.

Broad View's prairie garden is a garden space free without cost for GLBT members.  The garden area serves a threefold purpose:
1)To provide outdoor opportunities of a recreational nature in an atmosphere where friendships can develop and mature, and where our sense of self acceptance and dignity is affirmed,
2) To provide a nature experience for good mental and physical health (note:  for liabiltiy reasons a visit must be scheduled in advance), and
3) To find within ourselves a place to feel free:  free from fear of discrimination, free from shame, and free from judgment.  Therefore, a place to celebrate our own selves admist the bright rays of sun, many wildflowers and fluttering butterflies.
What We Need & What You Get

We need $3200 dollars.  It goes to buy 10 truck loads of gravel to make a lane allowing access to the praire garden by June of 2014.
What are the benefits of donating?

You provide a solution so LGBT can reach the garden area.
You are seen to be doing it.  That's your name posted on a sign at the garden. 
Your name given a 'shout out' on a web page on Broad View Wildflower Seed.
A set of four photos taken at the prairie garden are emailed to you with our thanks for your support.

Where do funds go if we don’t reach our entire goal?  No funds are spent; no money is collected at all.  The entire project does not occur; I can't do it without this funding project.  It is all or nothing; it is up to you.

Young LGBT have a unique place to romp, meditate; and/or study various prairie plants and prairie life forms.
A new place for LGBT to sing; play warrior Xexia or if you're into a him, a Hercules; and enjoy a wild prairie environment.

Watch the movie.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3><p>It’s really simple. We have X amount of years to completely rid ourselves of greenhouse gas emissions (Nobody knows exactly how few years X is). If we fail to do so our climate will set off on a path towards an earth that will become increasingly more hostile to the majority of the current lifeforms on this planet. This path will be irreversible. Our civilization will eventually come to an end. The vast majority of our great grandchildren will most probably die. Right now we, a supposedly intelligent species, are failing to prevent this cataclysmic future from happening. Watch the movie and you will understand.</p><p>The majority of us are “blissfully” uninformed about what is happening to the climate. And the ones who are actually informed, are tired and angry. It seems that no matter what we do we cannot invoke the needed changes fast enough from our society, a society that is largely driven by capital. It seems that all the climate action out there is shaped to influence politicians to make changes, and those changes either do not happen, or do not happen fast enough. Trying to influence others to discuss, to invoke change, to legislate, in order to somewhere down the line curb greenhouse gases, is proving to be a very time-consuming effort for the climate advocates around the world. And normally this is fine, it’s the way democracy works and sways over time. But the dark shadow of the climate threat has put us in a context that is anything but normal, and we are fresh out of the luxurious good called time. These darkening circumstances call for a new type of climate action, a more direct type of climate action.</p><p>The Atlas Clan and Helios Initiative were founded to facilitate the most direct climate action possible; There are billions of people on earth and we have the capital to accomplish anything if we do it together. If millions of us back the Helios Initiative and contribute to this massive cause - the building of thousands of solar plants for the greater good of future generations - we can rid ourselves of greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production. It’s direct, it’s simple. And yes, it's very, very, very big. But ultimately we are the people on this earth, and if we do not get our act together, then who?</p><p> </p><h3><strong>The idea behind the Helios Initiative</strong></h3><p>We want humanity to wake up, and to jointly invest in our planet, climate and future, by building thousands of solar power plants across the globe. We want this to happen in a relatively short time span so that we can bring down greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production ASAP.</p><p>This campaign gathers funds for the first of these solar plants.</p><p>We want to build the solar plants in succeeding iterations, where each iteration will build more plants than the previous one, and where the profit from existing plants will be invested into building the next iteration of plants.</p><p>We want this to be an effort by humanity, for humanity, that belongs to all of us regardless of who we are.</p><p>We want this solar plant and all future plants to contribute to equality amongst all humans on earth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Why we need $100 million</h3><p>We want to build a large solar plant, with a capacity of approximately 100MW which will cost around $100 million (slightly less, please see below). We have chosen a fixed campaign goal so that you can feel safe that your money will actually build a solar plant, or you get your money back (had we chosen flexible funding and only reached and kept a lesser amount kept than we need, then we would not be able to build the solar plant, which is the entire purpose of this initiative)</p><p> </p><h3><strong>What the money will be spent on</strong></h3><p>As much as possible of the money that backs this campaign will build the first solar plant. We will of course have to cover costs that are associated with setting up an operating solar plant, such as, but not limited to the design of the plant, country and land selection and acquisition, legal fees (including Solar Power Purchase Agreement), consulting fees (including due diligence and selection of contractor to build the plant). We will also have to cover the transaction costs of running this crowdfunding campaign. Finally, we will need to save a small reserve in cash to pay for the operation and maintenance of the plant before we see the first cash flow from electricity sales.</p><p>We do not have the technical knowledge on how to build a solar plant within our organization. We will hire all necessary knowledge. When this campaign gains momentum we will reach out to people and organizations who can give a more detailed picture of the cost distribution.</p><p>We will keep updating our backers about how exactly the money will be distributed. But to recap, we want as much of the money as possible to go into building the first solar plant.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>The timeline</strong></h3><p>We have chosen to try to raise the funds in 2 months because that is the maximum available on Indiegogo. Given the share size of our goal we would probably have needed a few more months, but two it is. We need this time to get the momentum for the campaign up, to get news outlets curious, to get people sharing on social media, to get people engaged in the initiative. Plus, we need the time to add more details about the Helios Initiative as more and more people join our cause, not just by backing our us, but by joining the Atlas Clan and contributing with knowledge, know-how, passion and skills.</p><p>You can really help this Initiative by sharing this page on social media.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Regarding perks</strong></h3><p>By now, campaign backers across the globe are used to obtaining perks when backing campaigns – a shout out, a vlog thank you that you look at once, a t-shirt that you will never wear, your name on a solar panel in a distant place that you will never visit…</p><p>Let’s not do that. All perks would be a project on their own, and frankly, we are still a very small organization. We want as much of your money as possible to go into the construction of the first solar plant. Our priority is not to give you gifts, but to keep your great grandkids alive.</p><p>So far, gratitude is all we can do. Everything else would be a waste of your time and money.</p><p>Besides, for anyone investing in this initiative, the greatest perk ever is that we actually build the first solar plant.</p><p>So, select a backing level that you feel comfortable with. Whatever you can give, no matter how small is still a big deal to us.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>About the Atlas Clan</strong></h3><p>The Atlas Clan is a Swedish non-profit association founded by Rafael Arelin in 2016. Our humble aim is to gather as much of humanity as possible to jointly build assets and companies that will directly lower the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by humanity. We acknowledge that this is a gargantuan prospect, but the circumstances leave us with few options. The entire human race needs to get engaged for this initiative to work, and the resulting network of assets and companies to belong to humanity. We believe that it will lead to a more equal and better society.  Thus, the assets and companies will be owned by the Atlas Clan, and anyone on earth can join the Atlas Clan as a member and vote in matters concerning the Atlas Clan and the future assets and companies that will be held by the association. The assets and companies held by the Atlas Clan will belong to all adults aged 18 living on earth, regardless if they are members or not. When greenhouse gas emissions are subdued and our climate no longer poses a threat to us, the earnings can be divided evenly among all adults living on earth on a monthly or yearly basis.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>About the Helios Initiative</strong></h3><p>Since our politicians and the corporations will not build the full amount of needed solar plants (or other clean power plants) in time to prevent our climate from turning against us, we will need to close the gap by building our own solar plants.</p><p>The Helios Initiative is an initiative by the Atlas Clan to gather funds via crowdfunding to build solar plants across the globe to off-set greenhouse gas emissions from coal plants and gas plants. Once we have raised funds for the first solar plant we will create the Helios Initiative company, which will own the first solar plant, and all future plants. All the company’s stock will be owned by the Atlas Clan Association. All the earnings will be reinvested into new solar plants.</p><p>Anyone who joins the Atlas Clan as a member will be able to influence the activity of the Helios Initiative company.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Join the Clan</strong></h3><p>We are at the start of our journey. We have an organization, we have our statutes, we have an initiative and a crowdfunding campaign. Most importantly, we have an idea; that together we, the humans on this earth, can rid ourselves of greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production, and by doing so we create an asset that benefits the entire human race.</p><p>Back us and change the course of history.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>What you can do</strong></h3><p><strong>1)</strong> First of all, invest 20 minutes to watch the movie if you already haven’t.</p><p><strong>2)</strong> Then BACK THIS CAMPAIGN. It’s very simple. When enough people back us this idea will gain momentum. This will give us the necessary clout to speak with all the necessary organisations out there that we need as partners to buld the solar plant. When they are on board, more people will feel confident in backing this project, and it will fly. When it does and when we reach our goal, we will build humanity's first large solar plant, built by all of us. That is massive!

Watch the movie. Why?It’s really simple. We have X amount of years to completely rid ourselves of greenhouse gas emissions (Nobody knows exactly how few years X is). If we fail to do so our climate will set off on a path towards an earth that will become increasingly more hostile to the majority of the current lifeforms on this planet. This path will be irreversible. Our civilization will eventually come to an end. The vast majority of our great grandchildren will most probably die. Right now we, a supposedly intelligent species, are failing to prevent this cataclysmic future from happening. Watch the movie and you will understand.The majority of us are “blissfully” uninformed about what is happening to the climate. And the ones who are actually informed, are tired and angry. It seems that no matter what we do we cannot invoke the needed changes fast enough from our society, a society that is largely driven by capital. It seems that all the climate action out there is shaped to influence politicians to make changes, and those changes either do not happen, or do not happen fast enough. Trying to influence others to discuss, to invoke change, to legislate, in order to somewhere down the line curb greenhouse gases, is proving to be a very time-consuming effort for the climate advocates around the world. And normally this is fine, it’s the way democracy works and sways over time. But the dark shadow of the climate threat has put us in a context that is anything but normal, and we are fresh out of the luxurious good called time. These darkening circumstances call for a new type of climate action, a more direct type of climate action.The Atlas Clan and Helios Initiative were founded to facilitate the most direct climate action possible; There are billions of people on earth and we have the capital to accomplish anything if we do it together. If millions of us back the Helios Initiative and contribute to this massive cause - the building of thousands of solar plants for the greater good of future generations - we can rid ourselves of greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production. It’s direct, it’s simple. And yes, it's very, very, very big. But ultimately we are the people on this earth, and if we do not get our act together, then who? The idea behind the Helios InitiativeWe want humanity to wake up, and to jointly invest in our planet, climate and future, by building thousands of solar power plants across the globe. We want this to happen in a relatively short time span so that we can bring down greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production ASAP.This campaign gathers funds for the first of these solar plants.We want to build the solar plants in succeeding iterations, where each iteration will build more plants than the previous one, and where the profit from existing plants will be invested into building the next iteration of plants.We want this to be an effort by humanity, for humanity, that belongs to all of us regardless of who we are.We want this solar plant and all future plants to contribute to equality amongst all humans on earth.  Why we need $100 millionWe want to build a large solar plant, with a capacity of approximately 100MW which will cost around $100 million (slightly less, please see below). We have chosen a fixed campaign goal so that you can feel safe that your money will actually build a solar plant, or you get your money back (had we chosen flexible funding and only reached and kept a lesser amount kept than we need, then we would not be able to build the solar plant, which is the entire purpose of this initiative) What the money will be spent onAs much as possible of the money that backs this campaign will build the first solar plant. We will of course have to cover costs that are associated with setting up an operating solar plant, such as, but not limited to the design of the plant, country and land selection and acquisition, legal fees (including Solar Power Purchase Agreement), consulting fees (including due diligence and selection of contractor to build the plant). We will also have to cover the transaction costs of running this crowdfunding campaign. Finally, we will need to save a small reserve in cash to pay for the operation and maintenance of the plant before we see the first cash flow from electricity sales.We do not have the technical knowledge on how to build a solar plant within our organization. We will hire all necessary knowledge. When this campaign gains momentum we will reach out to people and organizations who can give a more detailed picture of the cost distribution.We will keep updating our backers about how exactly the money will be distributed. But to recap, we want as much of the money as possible to go into building the first solar plant. The timelineWe have chosen to try to raise the funds in 2 months because that is the maximum available on Indiegogo. Given the share size of our goal we would probably have needed a few more months, but two it is. We need this time to get the momentum for the campaign up, to get news outlets curious, to get people sharing on social media, to get people engaged in the initiative. Plus, we need the time to add more details about the Helios Initiative as more and more people join our cause, not just by backing our us, but by joining the Atlas Clan and contributing with knowledge, know-how, passion and skills.You can really help this Initiative by sharing this page on social media. Regarding perksBy now, campaign backers across the globe are used to obtaining perks when backing campaigns – a shout out, a vlog thank you that you look at once, a t-shirt that you will never wear, your name on a solar panel in a distant place that you will never visit…Let’s not do that. All perks would be a project on their own, and frankly, we are still a very small organization. We want as much of your money as possible to go into the construction of the first solar plant. Our priority is not to give you gifts, but to keep your great grandkids alive.So far, gratitude is all we can do. Everything else would be a waste of your time and money.Besides, for anyone investing in this initiative, the greatest perk ever is that we actually build the first solar plant.So, select a backing level that you feel comfortable with. Whatever you can give, no matter how small is still a big deal to us. About the Atlas ClanThe Atlas Clan is a Swedish non-profit association founded by Rafael Arelin in 2016. Our humble aim is to gather as much of humanity as possible to jointly build assets and companies that will directly lower the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by humanity. We acknowledge that this is a gargantuan prospect, but the circumstances leave us with few options. The entire human race needs to get engaged for this initiative to work, and the resulting network of assets and companies to belong to humanity. We believe that it will lead to a more equal and better society.  Thus, the assets and companies will be owned by the Atlas Clan, and anyone on earth can join the Atlas Clan as a member and vote in matters concerning the Atlas Clan and the future assets and companies that will be held by the association. The assets and companies held by the Atlas Clan will belong to all adults aged 18 living on earth, regardless if they are members or not. When greenhouse gas emissions are subdued and our climate no longer poses a threat to us, the earnings can be divided evenly among all adults living on earth on a monthly or yearly basis. About the Helios InitiativeSince our politicians and the corporations will not build the full amount of needed solar plants (or other clean power plants) in time to prevent our climate from turning against us, we will need to close the gap by building our own solar plants.The Helios Initiative is an initiative by the Atlas Clan to gather funds via crowdfunding to build solar plants across the globe to off-set greenhouse gas emissions from coal plants and gas plants. Once we have raised funds for the first solar plant we will create the Helios Initiative company, which will own the first solar plant, and all future plants. All the company’s stock will be owned by the Atlas Clan Association. All the earnings will be reinvested into new solar plants.Anyone who joins the Atlas Clan as a member will be able to influence the activity of the Helios Initiative company. Join the ClanWe are at the start of our journey. We have an organization, we have our statutes, we have an initiative and a crowdfunding campaign. Most importantly, we have an idea; that together we, the humans on this earth, can rid ourselves of greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production, and by doing so we create an asset that benefits the entire human race.Back us and change the course of history. What you can do1) First of all, invest 20 minutes to watch the movie if you already haven’t.2) Then BACK THIS CAMPAIGN. It’s very simple. When enough people back us this idea will gain momentum. This will give us the necessary clout to speak with all the necessary organisations out there that we need as partners to buld the solar plant. When they are on board, more people will feel confident in backing this project, and it will fly. When it does and when we reach our goal, we will build humanity's first large solar plant, built by all of us. That is massive! Directly after that we will launch a new campaign to build two more solar plants, followed by more campaigns and more solar plants.3) Share our movie and share our campaign with everyone you are connected to on social media4) Finally, get engaged.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><b><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"">Why do you call yourselves the Solar Joulers?</span></font></b></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">A “Joule” is a scientific unit of energy. We harvest
    and store “Joules.” We like to think of it as harvesting “jewels” of solar
    energy.</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><b><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"">How do Solar Joulers’ (SJI) collectors work?</span></font></b></span><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt;"">Our modules use heat pipes (HP) to transport the heat from
    the black collector surface into a concealed heat exchanger at the top of the
    collector where it is transferred to the heating system fluid. There are no
    mechanical moving parts to break. </span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt;"">Please watch the video or refer to our web site for more
    information.</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><b><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"">How are SJI systems different?</span></font></b></span><span><font size=""3""></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Traditional panels circulate fluid into a bottom
    header (large pipe) and up through many smaller pipes (risers) attached to the
    black collector. The Sun’s energy is transferred into the risers. The heated
    fluid exits the risers into a top header and is pumped back to the storage
    tank. </span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">In solar thermal collectors that use glass vacuum
    tubes, the internal heat pipes may operate at very high temperatures.  They are prone to overheating reliability
    problems.  The vacuum tubes plug into a
    heat exchanger above them—a rather unsightly arrangement. </span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">In SJI collectors, the heat transferring fluid only
    flows through a heat exchanger at the top—there are no risers. The heat
    exchanger sits behind the black solar surface, so no solar-collecting-area is
    wasted and the collectors look very attractive. Aluminum and polycarbonate
    plastic are used, which makes the assembled array virtually unbreakable yet
    lightweight.</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><b><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"">How is solar thermal (ST) different than photovoltaic (PV)?</span></font></b></span><span><font size=""3""></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">ST collects the sun’s energy as heat. PV converts it
    into electricity. ST is about 500% more efficient than PV, and takes up only
    1/5 the collector mount area as PV. The installed cost per Watt of ST is about
    half the cost of PV. PV works well for generating electricity, but ST is the
    best solution for heating applications.</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><b><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"">Why should we consider doing this?</span></font></b></span><span><font size=""3""></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Many SJI installations will save you money from
    day one... Your average utility savings will be more than your monthly system
    payment. You become more energy independent; immune from rising energy costs,
    and when the system is paid off, you have a perpetual abundance of free energy
    for decades—see Time to Free Energy TTFE chart. </span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">You can play an important role in reducing greenhouse
    gases too... Heating hot water plus your house can reduce your carbon emissions
    by 25-60%. Reduced pollution translates to healthier lives. You are also
    contributing to better national energy security. </span></font></span><span><font size=""3""></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><b><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"">Why is overall system cost lower with Solar Jouler
    systems?</span></font></b></span><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt;"">The total cost of the installed system (design services +
    components + shipping + installation + maintenance) is lower. If one of our
    pre-designed systems does not meet your needs, at no extra cost—we will design
    one for you that will. We sell direct to you or through certified specialists.</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Traditional panels typically weigh 150 lbs, or more,
    and must be shipped by freight and require insurance. Our modules weigh
    approximately 20 lbs each; ship by UPS or FedEx without insurance; do not
    require a crane to lift them onto a roof, and are easily assembled on-site. Roof-mounted
    systems already include the cost of the mounting tracks. No soldering is
    required. </span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">In short, installation takes less time and is ideal
    for do-it-yourself people. Professional installation costs less too because it
    takes less time. Replacing parts (if ever needed) takes little time. Our high
    reliability assures low maintenance costs. All this adds up to lower system
    cost. </span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><b><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"">What happens to Solar Jouler collectors during stagnation?</span></font></b></span><span><font size=""3""></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Nothing!</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Stagnation
    is the condition where the pump is off while the sun is shining. This causes
    the collectors to overheat and expand, and may result in emergency repairs in
    current systems. It is an industry-wide problem.</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Solar
    Jouler collectors are designed to tolerate overheating and keep internal
    temperatures within reasonable levels.<font color=""blue""></font></span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><b><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"">Why are Solar Joulers Collectors more reliable?</span></font></b></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">The heated fluid only flows through a thick-walled
    heat exchanger. The heat exchanger modules connect with ultra-reliable flange
    joints. </span></font></span><span><font size=""3""></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Traditional panels have many weld joints, which
    increases their probability of a leak. A leak becomes an emergency!  SJI systems have no weld joints other than
    the ultra-reliable fusion of the flange to the heat exchanger. </span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">SJI
    collectors tolerate stagnation without damage. They mount on tracks that allow
    thermal expansion and contraction. The heat transport system has built-in
    redundancy. <span class=""GramE"">I<font color=""black""><span style=""color: black;"">f a
    SJI system has 96 heat pipes (4 per heat pipe module) and one fails, 95 will
    still continue working full-strength; allowing its neighbors to pick up the
    slack.</span></font></span> Because this synergistic cooperation is ultra
    reliable, our overall reliability is governed by the thick walls of our heat
    exchangers and their fused flanges. Our chance of a fluid leak is simply a lot
    lower. </span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt;"">Our systems contain no glass. </span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><b><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"">What about maintenance?</span></font></b></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt;"">SJI modules are designed to last and have built in
    redundancy. If ever needed, repairs are simple and quick. It takes 15 minutes
    to hot-swap a module without shutting down the system.  If a “riser” leaks on a traditional panel, it causes
    an emergency and the whole system must be shut down until it is fixed. For
    economic reasons, these risers must be thin-walled; therefore they are more
    prone to leaking. </span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt;"">SJI recommends basic system check and service at 5 year
    intervals.</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><b><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"">How long will SJ collectors last?</span></font></b></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">SJ
    collectors are designed and built to operate for decades.  Main aluminum components may last for up to
    99 years or more. The polycarbonate plastic window is impregnated with UV
    protection. The manufacturer specifies a 20-year life. In ten years, the top
    glazing may be less efficient by up to 10% (and then it stays at that level).
    At the owner’s option, it could be replaced. It’s a 5-minute job to replace an
    inexpensive window.</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><b><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"">What about warranty of the components?</span></font></b></span><span><font size=""3""></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">We warrant the HPM portion of the collector for 10
    years. We warrant the heat exchanger portion of the collector for 10 years as
    well, provided non-corrosive fluids are used. With proper attention to the type
    of fluids used in the heat exchanger, a SJI collector should operate for many decades.</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><b><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"">Is Solar right for my location?</span></font></b></span><span><font size=""3""></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Solar
    thermal works well in most geographic locations that receive adequate
    sunshine. Collectors should face a
    southerly direction (SE-S-SW optimal) in areas free of shade. Please point towards NE-N-NW if
    you reside in the southern hemisphere.</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Other cost benefit factors include your fuel type, cost and usage. Please refer to the Time to Free Energy (TTFE) table for an estimate in years for your location. Our smart App, once
    implemented, will quickly show you the expected payback time for
    various configurations for your location. You can be involved in choosing your
    optimal system. </span></font></span></p>

<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt;"">Using your smart device, the App helps you position your
    portable collector for optimum performance. Simply place your smart device on
    the collector surface and the App directs you to the optimal tilt position and
    compass orientation for your location and time of year.  This takes the
    guesswork out of collector positioning.</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Based
    on your location, fuel type, fuel cost, fuel usage and expected inflation rate,
    the App looks up historical solar data and calculates your estimated payback
    time and how many tons of CO2 is kept from spewing into the air<font color=""black""><span style=""color: black;"">. </span></font></span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt;"">Future updates include GPS and satellite mapping with remote design capabilities, as well as measuring and reporting the energy
    collected, money saved, and carbon offset in easy to understand graphs. </span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><b><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"">I am handy with tools, can I install it myself or must I use a professional?</span></font></b></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Our
    systems are designed for a simple, quick installation. They require only a
    handful of ordinary tools. No soldering is required. The heaviest component
    only weighs 20 lbs so an adult can easily carry them to the installation site.
    Each module is secured to the mounting track with a metal “key.” A three-wide array
    (SJ-3)</span></font></span><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> should only take about 15
    minutes to install onto the track. Track mounting time depends on the site.
    Mounting to a roof or a wall should only take a short time.</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">If you roof-mount, you may elect to have a licensed
    person do this part of the job.  An
    unlicensed person making “roof penetrations” may void the part of your
    insurance covering roof leaks. </span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font size=""3""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">We recommend that you (1) use a local professional
    installer, or (2) consult with your local building department if you plan to
    install a system yourself. </span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><b><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"">What ways can I mount Solar Jouler collectors?</span></font></b></span><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt;"">They can be mounted flush with the roof, on struts, on a
    wall or on ground supports.  Strut mounts
    are the most solar-efficient, but they require extra hardware and they usually
    require engineering.  Flush roof mounts
    are simpler, but may be less solar efficient.  However, adding a few more collectors to a
    flush-mounted system may cost no more when considering that the track-mounting
    hardware cost is already included—and they are more attractive. Mounting to a
    south-facing wall is a good option for space heating because it optimizes
    winter sun.</span></font></span></p>

<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt;"">You may build arrays up to 30 modules wide. However,
    multiple arrays can operate in parallel, so there is really no limit to the
    size of a properly designed system.</span></font></span></p>

<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt;"">Yes—a hot water system can be expanded to include space
    heating. It works best with baseboard radiators or radiant heating
    systems.  A SJI system can also be used
    to assist a forced air heat-pump-based system to heat your whole house.</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span><font color=""black"" size=""3""><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt;"">We also have a space-heating application note that shows
    how to incorporate a simple radiator. Solar panels are installed on a
    south-facing wall with radiator(s) on the opposite side of the wall. This is
    ideal for multi-storey buildings. It will still heat during power outages and
    during the aftermath of a “super storm.”</span></font></span></p>

You already know that the sun is the ultimate source of all forms of energy on our planet. Solar Joulers has developed new technology to help you tap more directly into that infinite source. Solar thermal heat can help you save money, improve your life, and reduce your carbon footprint.  
Solar Joulers' products capture the sun's free energy directly in the form of heat, and help eliminate our dependence on fossil fuel. Nearly half of all global energy use, and 2/3 of U.S. household energy, is for heating processes. We at Solar Joulers believe we can help free people from the shackles of burning fossil fuel for heat.

Consider:

≈ $250,000,000,000 ($250 Billion) spent annually in the US to purchase fossil fuels for heating processes.
≈ $1,000,000,000,000 ($1 Trillion) spent globally to purchase fossil fuels for heating each year.
Over 10,000,000,000 (Ten Billion) tons of pollutants, CO2, and other greenhouse gases emitted into our environment each year, just for heating.
1,000,000,000+ (1 Billion) of our fellow human beings consume biologically contaminated water every day!
Our Goal is to help everyone become more energy independent, and promote a more sustainable future, while reducing our impact on the planet.Our World Vision includes the belief that together, we can also help provide relief to the billions of residents of our planet that lack access to safe drinking water. Solar Thermal can help provide the solution.

Where We Are Now
The Solar Joulers Team has spent 7 years preparing for this product launch.  We have built, tested, learned, re-designed, tested, demonstrated and proved the technology, materials and supply chain. Solar Jouler modules are the lightest, easiest-to-install, most reliable, and the lowest dollar-per-watt installed cost available. Easiest to install, great durability, light weight, high performance, lowest installed cost, and fast payback. We now have our ducks lined up and are ready to go to the next level.
What We Need to Reach the Next Level
To achieve our goals we need to implement the following tasks, designed to scale our company up from an R&D facility to full scale production:

Purchase, install and train workers on the use of large capacity automation equipment.
Factory upgrades.
Hiring and training production workers.
Large scale procurement of raw materials.
Form Business Development and Customer Experience team.
More Testing, and Certification which qualifies our customers for government and utility rebates.
See our Launch Schedule below for a time line to implement these steps after we achieve funding.

Time To Free Energy
If you live between the green and orange areas of the solar map below, you can find your time to payback (before gov't and utility rebates) depending on the fuel you are currently using.  From then on, you get Free Energy!




Frequently Asked Questions
Why do you call yourselves the Solar Joulers?
A “Joule” is a scientific unit of energy. We harvest
    and store “Joules.” We like to think of it as harvesting “jewels” of solar
    energy.
How do Solar Joulers’ (SJI) collectors work?
Our modules use heat pipes (HP) to transport the heat from
    the black collector surface into a concealed heat exchanger at the top of the
    collector where it is transferred to the heating system fluid. There are no
    mechanical moving parts to break. 
Please watch the video or refer to our web site for more
    information.
How are SJI systems different?
Traditional panels circulate fluid into a bottom
    header (large pipe) and up through many smaller pipes (risers) attached to the
    black collector. The Sun’s energy is transferred into the risers. The heated
    fluid exits the risers into a top header and is pumped back to the storage
    tank. 
In solar thermal collectors that use glass vacuum
    tubes, the internal heat pipes may operate at very high temperatures.  They are prone to overheating reliability
    problems.  The vacuum tubes plug into a
    heat exchanger above them—a rather unsightly arrangement. 
In SJI collectors, the heat transferring fluid only
    flows through a heat exchanger at the top—there are no risers. The heat
    exchanger sits behind the black solar surface, so no solar-collecting-area is
    wasted and the collectors look very attractive. Aluminum and polycarbonate
    plastic are used, which makes the assembled array virtually unbreakable yet
    lightweight.
How is solar thermal (ST) different than photovoltaic (PV)?
ST collects the sun’s energy as heat. PV converts it
    into electricity. ST is about 500% more efficient than PV, and takes up only
    1/5 the collector mount area as PV. The installed cost per Watt of ST is about
    half the cost of PV. PV works well for generating electricity, but ST is the
    best solution for heating applications.
Why should we consider doing this?
Many SJI installations will save you money from
    day one... Your average utility savings will be more than your monthly system
    payment. You become more energy independent; immune from rising energy costs,
    and when the system is paid off, you have a perpetual abundance of free energy
    for decades—see Time to Free Energy TTFE chart. 
You can play an important role in reducing greenhouse
    gases too... Heating hot water plus your house can reduce your carbon emissions
    by 25-60%. Reduced pollution translates to healthier lives. You are also
    contributing to better national energy security. 
Why is overall system cost lower with Solar Jouler
    systems?
The total cost of the installed system (design services +
    components + shipping + installation + maintenance) is lower. If one of our
    pre-designed systems does not meet your needs, at no extra cost—we will design
    one for you that will. We sell direct to you or through certified specialists.
Traditional panels typically weigh 150 lbs, or more,
    and must be shipped by freight and require insurance. Our modules weigh
    approximately 20 lbs each; ship by UPS or FedEx without insurance; do not
    require a crane to lift them onto a roof, and are easily assembled on-site. Roof-mounted
    systems already include the cost of the mounting tracks. No soldering is
    required. 
In short, installation takes less time and is ideal
    for do-it-yourself people. Professional installation costs less too because it
    takes less time. Replacing parts (if ever needed) takes little time. Our high
    reliability assures low maintenance costs. All this adds up to lower system
    cost. 
What happens to Solar Jouler collectors during stagnation?
Nothing!
Stagnation
    is the condition where the pump is off while the sun is shining. This causes
    the collectors to overheat and expand, and may result in emergency repairs in
    current systems. It is an industry-wide problem.
Solar
    Jouler collectors are designed to tolerate overheating and keep internal
    temperatures within reasonable levels.
Why are Solar Joulers Collectors more reliable?
The heated fluid only flows through a thick-walled
    heat exchanger. The heat exchanger modules connect with ultra-reliable flange
    joints. 
Traditional panels have many weld joints, which
    increases their probability of a leak. A leak becomes an emergency!  SJI systems have no weld joints other than
    the ultra-reliable fusion of the flange to the heat exchanger. 
SJI
    collectors tolerate stagnation without damage. They mount on tracks that allow
    thermal expansion and contraction. The heat transport system has built-in
    redundancy. If a
    SJI system has 96 heat pipes (4 per heat pipe module) and one fails, 95 will
    still continue working full-strength; allowing its neighbors to pick up the
    slack. Because this synergistic cooperation is ultra
    reliable, our overall reliability is governed by the thick walls of our heat
    exchangers and their fused flanges. Our chance of a fluid leak is simply a lot
    lower. 
Our systems contain no glass. 
What about maintenance?
SJI modules are designed to last and have built in
    redundancy. If ever needed, repairs are simple and quick. It takes 15 minutes
    to hot-swap a module without shutting down the system.  If a “riser” leaks on a traditional panel, it causes
    an emergency and the whole system must be shut down until it is fixed. For
    economic reasons, these risers must be thin-walled; therefore they are more
    prone to leaking. 
SJI recommends basic system check and service at 5 year
    intervals.
How long will SJ collectors last?
SJ
    collectors are designed and built to operate for decades.  Main aluminum components may last for up to
    99 years or more. The polycarbonate plastic window is impregnated with UV
    protection. The manufacturer specifies a 20-year life. In ten years, the top
    glazing may be less efficient by up to 10% (and then it stays at that level).
    At the owner’s option, it could be replaced. It’s a 5-minute job to replace an
    inexpensive window.
What about warranty of the components?
We warrant the HPM portion of the collector for 10
    years. We warrant the heat exchanger portion of the collector for 10 years as
    well, provided non-corrosive fluids are used. With proper attention to the type
    of fluids used in the heat exchanger, a SJI collector should operate for many decades.
Is Solar right for my location?
Solar
    thermal works well in most geographic locations that receive adequate
    sunshine. Collectors should face a
    southerly direction (SE-S-SW optimal) in areas free of shade. Please point towards NE-N-NW if
    you reside in the southern hemisphere.
Other cost benefit factors include your fuel type, cost and usage. Please refer to the Time to Free Energy (TTFE) table for an estimate in years for your location. Our smart App, once
    implemented, will quickly show you the expected payback time for
    various configurations for your location. You can be involved in choosing your
    optimal system. 
How does the Solar Jouler App work? What can I do
    with it?
Using your smart device, the App helps you position your
    portable collector for optimum performance. Simply place your smart device on
    the collector surface and the App directs you to the optimal tilt position and
    compass orientation for your location and time of year.  This takes the
    guesswork out of collector positioning.
Based
    on your location, fuel type, fuel cost, fuel usage and expected inflation rate,
    the App looks up historical solar data and calculates your estimated payback
    time and how many tons of CO2 is kept from spewing into the air. 
Future updates include GPS and satellite mapping with remote design capabilities, as well as measuring and reporting the energy
    collected, money saved, and carbon offset in easy to understand graphs. 
I am handy with tools, can I install it myself or must I use a professional?
Our
    systems are designed for a simple, quick installation. They require only a
    handful of ordinary tools. No soldering is required. The heaviest component
    only weighs 20 lbs so an adult can easily carry them to the installation site.
    Each module is secured to the mounting track with a metal “key.” A three-wide array
    (SJ-3) should only take about 15
    minutes to install onto the track. Track mounting time depends on the site.
    Mounting to a roof or a wall should only take a short time.
If you roof-mount, you may elect to have a licensed
    person do this part of the job.  An
    unlicensed person making “roof penetrations” may void the part of your
    insurance covering roof leaks. 
We recommend that you (1) use a local professional
    installer, or (2) consult with your local building department if you plan to
    install a system yourself. 
What ways can I mount Solar Jouler collectors?
They can be mounted flush with the roof, on struts, on a
    wall or on ground supports.  Strut mounts
    are the most solar-efficient, but they require extra hardware and they usually
    require engineering.  Flush roof mounts
    are simpler, but may be less solar efficient.  However, adding a few more collectors to a
    flush-mounted system may cost no more when considering that the track-mounting
    hardware cost is already included—and they are more attractive. Mounting to a
    south-facing wall is a good option for space heating because it optimizes
    winter sun.
How many solar modules can be connected together?
You may build arrays up to 30 modules wide. However,
    multiple arrays can operate in parallel, so there is really no limit to the
    size of a properly designed system.
Can I use Solar Jouler collectors to heat my home?
Yes—a hot water system can be expanded to include space
    heating. It works best with baseboard radiators or radiant heating
    systems.  A SJI system can also be used
    to assist a forced air heat-pump-based system to heat your whole house.
We also have a space-heating application note that shows
    how to incorporate a simple radiator. Solar panels are installed on a
    south-facing wall with radiator(s) on the opposite side of the wall. This is
    ideal for multi-storey buildings. It will still heat during power outages and
    during the aftermath of a “super storm.”
What can I use a portable solar collector for?
Our portable systems create new plug-and-play markets used
    for: RV’s, camping, picnics, tailgating, ice fishing, or anywhere and
    everywhere.  Potential uses include portable
    showers, cleaning dishes and utensils, washing clothes, washing hands, heating beverages and food, hot tubs, pasteurizing
    water, and space heating small rooms, sheds, greenhouses, playhouses,
    doghouses, etc.  There may be many other
    uses you can envision! 
Why will it take 9 to 12 months to get my product delivered?
We presently manufacture units in low volume with a small
    staff. Our initial focus will be on manufacturing staffing and tooling. We need
    additional skilled staff to streamline and further improve our manufacturing
    processes.  The tooling lets us build
    product cost effectively. We will continue to do extensive reliability testing
    to confirm the quality and long life of our products.
We estimate that in less than 6-months, key manufacturing
    and business functions will be operational. Once we’ve thoroughly tested newly
    manufactured units for quality and performance, we will submit our panels for
    SRCC certification (which is required for tax rebates and other incentives). We
    expect to begin delivery of small systems within 9-months from funding completion.
    Larger systems will take a few months longer.
Why might I want to
    invest in SJI?
We have several patents pending, and the
    product design is complete and tested. With our revolutionary collector designs
    we expect to transform global energy markets, for a better tomorrow, starting
    today. The market potential for our solution is compelling because the payback
    is quick and the lifetime cost savings are enormous.  Our ability to reduce the use of fossil fuels
    and carbon footprint is real. By investing in SJI you help make our shared vision
    a reality.

<h3>Figueirinha Ecotourism, Southwest Alentejo, Portugal</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Figueirinha Ecoturismo is a small venture of little less than 2 hectares (or 5 acres) with olive trees, organic farming, a main house with a central kitchen and living room, an outbuilding and a natural swimming pool.</p>
<p>In the main house there is the ""<em>Forno""</em> (oven) room, sharing its thick walls with the traditional wooden oven, and in the ""C<em>asa Nova""</em> (new house) outbuilding you find the ""<em>Serra""</em> (hill) and the ""<em>Ribeira""</em> (brook) rooms.</p>
<p>Thanks to its location within the borders of the National Ecological Reserve, Figueirinha is granted the silence and tranquillity of an off the beaten track refuge, even in the busy summer months of July and August. Still, it’s only 25 minutes away from the most beautiful and unspoilt beaches of the Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park.</p>
<p>Despite of behind rural, all needs are fulfilled and comfort was not left aside. Our solar panels assure complete energy self-sufficiency. Room kitchens are equipped with fridge, microwave oven and electric water heater.</p>
<p>You may ride our mountain bikes for free, hike on trails close by, swim in our natural pool or use our volleyball field. The nearest hamlet, Monte da Estrada, is a half hour walk away. There, the audacious can try the typical ""<em>café com cheirinho</em>"" (espresso coffee with a sip of ""<em>aguardente</em>"", a kind of pomace brandy). Other typical villages, such as São Luís, Vila Nova de Milfontes and Odemira, are easily reached by car.</p>
<p>Figueirinha is a perfect spot for those who want a restorative retreat to clean both body and soul. Yet, there’s also room for gastronomic gatherings based on Mediterranean food.</p>
<p>We produce our own vegetables and buy our other food items in local markets or from fair trade organizations. The same principles were applied on our furniture, fixtures or bedlinen.</p>
<p>Come visit us and meet the simplicity of Alentejo’s nature with a familiar and friendly touch.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need funds to build a prototype of the Glampp Ecosystem 40 at Figueirinha Ecoturismo in southwest Portugal.  We have already contacted suppliers and received offers. The funding goal isn't sufficient to cover the total costs of the project, but together with private funding it is enough to build the wooden platform structure, the wooden deck, and manufacture the tent which is the minimum to have glamping operational at Figueirinha. If we get over the funding goal we will continue to cover the material costs in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wooden bungalow;</li>
<li>Technical textile membrane (2nd layer with anti-fungi, UV-filter and fire retardant coatings)</li>
<li>Technical material (electrical installation, pipework, water tank, compost toilet, solar heater)</li>
<li>Automation and control equipment</li>

<br/><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The fast development in the tourism industry specifically in southern Europe has been responsible for the disorganised expansion of agglomerations and construction in sensitive areas exhausting natural resources such as water and being the cause for desertification of land. This has been specially critical in the coastal regions of western Mediterranean countries such as Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece.</p>
<p>""If you look at the Mediterranean, it's unsustainable,"" said Walter Kreiken, a researcher for the Coastal &amp; Marine Union (EUCC), an association based in the Netherlands which promotes coastal conservation and research into coastal issues.</p>
<p>The European Union (EU) has put ""integrated coastal-zone management"" guidelines into place, making coastal conservation a top priority for the 28-member bloc. Yet the EU can only do so much. While individual countries such as Britain and Sweden have taken the lead in conserving their coastlines, that's not happening everywhere, Kreiken said. In southern Europe, developers continue to push for golf courses and large hotels in areas where there simply isn't enough water.</p>
<p>According to the European Environment Agency, <a href=""http://www.dw.de/europes-coastlines-under-threat/a-2997510"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Portugal has one of the fastest rates of coastal development in Europe</a>.</p>
<p>The Glampp at Figueirinha project can serve as example and give a message to the local authorities that the future and development of tourism can be in small-scale and low impact sustainable tourism. Figueirinha is  gorgeously located on the border of Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park, which is still one of the most well preserved and unspoilt stretches of coastline in Europe.</p>
<p>The threats of the continuing pressure from mass-scale tourism industry are present today and in future projects putting at risk the preservation of the coastline, its biodiversity and the authenticity of the region. This is evidenced by a recently approved mass-scale project within 25km from Figueirinha Ecotourism and inside the borders of the Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park, which was recently the object of a <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-quercus-protect-one-of-europe-s-best-preserved-coastline-areas/x/3809746"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">crowdfunding campaign</a> to support legal action against the approving authorities.</p>
<p>We hope that with your help the success of this campaign can help us in preserving the beautiful and unspoilt southwest coastline through the practice and promotion of sustainable practices of tourism!</p>

The Glampp at Figueirinha crowdfunding campaign has 3 main objectives:


Build a prototype of the Glampp Ecosystem 40, a sustainable glamping module for ecotourism.

Implement Glamping at Figueirinha, an ecotourism venture in south-west Portugal. Glamping provides an unique outdoors experience with the luxury of a city accommodation.

Promote the conservation of the southwest coast of Portugal through sustainable practices of tourism.

You can contribute to the above by participating to a surf camp, to workshops, cycling along the one of the most well preserved coastlines in Europe or just relax in our Glampp or countryside rooms and enjoy the local food.

 






 
The Glampp Ecosystem 40
The Glampp Ecosystem 40 is a glamping module for sustainable tourism.

The Glampp Ecosystem 40 has been designed to use less materials and resources than conventional tourism ventures, making it a more sustainable tourism product;
There are no permanent installations, meaning that the site will be conserved and maintained to the original after removing the module.
It uses recyclable materials and either local sustainable wood or FSC certified wood.
It relies fully on 100% renewable energy through the use of solar panels, being thus energetically self-sufficient.
It uses elements from solar passive and permaculture design, such as the solar water heating system and the compost toilet.
It is smart: email reports and alarms can be sent to the site manager providing the status of the technical systems, such as the charging state of the solar battery array or water supply level.
You are closer to nature while enjoying the comfort from home!

</h3> <p>I'm your stereotypical Millennial, trying to figure out what to do with my life. I've been in the environmental field for three years now, working as a Field Teacher/Naturalist and serving with AmeriCorps Cape Cod (more info here: <a href=""http://www.americorpscapecod.org)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.americorpscapecod.org</a>). Because nature has always played such a major role in my life, for my next step I really want to get people excited about nature and help them to see it as valuable. I believe that once people are invested in nature and the natural spaces around them, they'll be more inclined to take action to care for these spaces.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

<p></p>
<h3>But How Will You Do This?</h3>My first step will be to find out what would actually get people excited about nature. Do they want to read a book or a blog, or listen to a podcast, or is social media the key? What types of social media? And what kind of information should I share? I will be able to research all this through a fantastic program called the Millennial Trains Project.  (<a href=""http://www.millennialtrain.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.millennialtrain.co</a>) If I earn a spot in this program, I'll spend a week in August traveling across the country by train with other Millennials pursuing their own exciting projects. We'll be joined along the way by mentors looking to share their knowledge with us, and we'll be stopping in a new city each day, where I will interview people about the best approach to my nature campaign. Once this journey is over, I'll use my findings to figure out the best method to spread the word about nature, and then I'll undertake an even bigger project to do just that. <br/><p>While on the train I will also be asking people whether or not nature is important to them. If they answer yes, I'll ask why, and I'll use those stories in my later project. If the answer is no, I'll ask them why not, and how I might be able to change that. Once I start my larger project, I hope to continue traveling so I can incorporate more stories from people across the country and ultimately around the world about why nature is important to them.</p>

</h3> <p style=""text-align: center;"">Here's the thing about the Millennial Trains Project (MTP): my project has been officially approved, but more projects are approved than there are spaces available, so I have to race to crowdfund the money I need to get on the train. <b>There are only a few spots left, so please help me reach my goal as fast as possible! </b>No contribution is too small, I appreciate any help. And if you can't contribute financially, please help spread the word about my campaign.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">As far as where that $5000 actually goes, if I reach my goal fast enough, all contributions will go directly to MTP to help underwrite 
expenses associated with the journey (on-train accommodation, meals, and
 all MTP-related programming activities). And good news! It's tax-deductible, because MTP is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">If I don't reach my goal in time, and I don't make it on the train, none of you wonderful supporters will be charged, and you will keep your money. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In addition to a tax deduction, depending on how much you are able to contribute, I have some pretty sweet perks available! They're over there on the right, so be sure to check them out.</p>

<h3>Why Is This Important?<br/>
</h3>Nature is a valuable resource for a endless number of reasons, and it's a resource that is constantly threatened. I hope that by making nature ""cool"", I can get people around the world excited to do their part to help conserve and preserve new areas of natural space and to be better stewards of the areas that already exist.<br/><br/>Another big reason I'm pursuing this project is that we as a society are spending less and less time outside, which is problematic for many reasons. I hope that by getting people, especially younger generations, excited about nature, they will be inclined to spend more time outdoors.<br/> <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463620879/4_f0gi0x.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 422.341px;height: 281px;""/></p>

</h3> <p style=""text-align: center;"">If you just can't contribute, or if you can but are looking for other ways to help, I still need you! Please spread the word about my Indiegogo campaign to as many people as you can. Indiegogo has great share tools for sharing this campaign on your social media platforms of choice, but any way that you can tell more people increases the chances that I'll make my goal in time to earn a spot on MTP's 2016 journeys. <br/></p>

</div></div>","So What's the Deal?
 I'm your stereotypical Millennial, trying to figure out what to do with my life. I've been in the environmental field for three years now, working as a Field Teacher/Naturalist and serving with AmeriCorps Cape Cod (more info here: www.americorpscapecod.org). Because nature has always played such a major role in my life, for my next step I really want to get people excited about nature and help them to see it as valuable. I believe that once people are invested in nature and the natural spaces around them, they'll be more inclined to take action to care for these spaces.




But How Will You Do This?My first step will be to find out what would actually get people excited about nature. Do they want to read a book or a blog, or listen to a podcast, or is social media the key? What types of social media? And what kind of information should I share? I will be able to research all this through a fantastic program called the Millennial Trains Project.  (www.millennialtrain.co) If I earn a spot in this program, I'll spend a week in August traveling across the country by train with other Millennials pursuing their own exciting projects. We'll be joined along the way by mentors looking to share their knowledge with us, and we'll be stopping in a new city each day, where I will interview people about the best approach to my nature campaign. Once this journey is over, I'll use my findings to figure out the best method to spread the word about nature, and then I'll undertake an even bigger project to do just that. While on the train I will also be asking people whether or not nature is important to them. If they answer yes, I'll ask why, and I'll use those stories in my later project. If the answer is no, I'll ask them why not, and how I might be able to change that. Once I start my larger project, I hope to continue traveling so I can incorporate more stories from people across the country and ultimately around the world about why nature is important to them.


  Why Do You Need My Money and What's In It For Me?
 Here's the thing about the Millennial Trains Project (MTP): my project has been officially approved, but more projects are approved than there are spaces available, so I have to race to crowdfund the money I need to get on the train. There are only a few spots left, so please help me reach my goal as fast as possible! No contribution is too small, I appreciate any help. And if you can't contribute financially, please help spread the word about my campaign.
As far as where that $5000 actually goes, if I reach my goal fast enough, all contributions will go directly to MTP to help underwrite 
expenses associated with the journey (on-train accommodation, meals, and
 all MTP-related programming activities). And good news! It's tax-deductible, because MTP is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization.
If I don't reach my goal in time, and I don't make it on the train, none of you wonderful supporters will be charged, and you will keep your money. 
In addition to a tax deduction, depending on how much you are able to contribute, I have some pretty sweet perks available! They're over there on the right, so be sure to check them out.



 
Why Is This Important?
Nature is a valuable resource for a endless number of reasons, and it's a resource that is constantly threatened. I hope that by making nature ""cool"", I can get people around the world excited to do their part to help conserve and preserve new areas of natural space and to be better stewards of the areas that already exist.Another big reason I'm pursuing this project is that we as a society are spending less and less time outside, which is problematic for many reasons. I hope that by getting people, especially younger generations, excited about nature, they will be inclined to spend more time outdoors. 
 Are There Any Other Ways I Can Help?
 If you just can't contribute, or if you can but are looking for other ways to help, I still need you! Please spread the word about my Indiegogo campaign to as many people as you can. Indiegogo has great share tools for sharing this campaign on your social media platforms of choice, but any way that you can tell more people increases the chances that I'll make my goal in time to earn a spot on MTP's 2016 journeys.

<p>Roof Mirror is basically a mirror that extends 1-2 ft from the edge of your roof and reflects otherwise lost sunlight back into your room.  This does many things: 1.

<p>The patent-pending initial model of the Roof Mirror is a mirror extending slightly more than a foot off the edge of the roof by means of two supports arms attached to the rafters under the eave.  It is extremely light, does not put any significant pressure to the rafters, very easy to install, and can be customized.  The angle of the mirror can be adjusted by using bolts of different lenghts to attach it on the support arms.  The arms are made from steel tubes welded together and powder-coated.</p>
<p>The mirror is plexiglas that can be coated with two kinds of special coatings. The first kind is transparent when there is no sun (i.e. early morning or evenings), and acts like a regular flat mirror when the sun shines on it. The second kind is a metallic-coating that diffuses the light and illuminates a larger area.</p>
<p>The patent-pending second model of the Roof Mirror is a slightly modified version of the first with an adjustable set of joints between the support arms and the mirror.  This allows easy setup and later easy adjustment.  The third model includes a remote control to actually adjust the mirror's angle, from the comfort of your room.  Finally, the fourth model includes a remote control and a solar-powered sun-tracking system.  We are also contemplating a satellite system that will focus the light from space onto the Roof Mirror (okay, that was a joke).  Eventually, your visitors will not be able to tell which side is South and which side North!</p>

<p>The biggest challenges we came across while developing this product were determining the optimum angles, the materials, and stress-strain calculations.  For the angles, we had to revisit our high-school physics knowledge on mirrors and sun's position.  It turns out there are several different optimum angles, depending on which season you want the maximum exposure.  We figured winter would be the season when the sun's rays would be most welcome into the homes, so our basic model is based on an incident angle of 25-35.  The best results for this angle are obtained at 90 degrees mirror angle.  However, you have the flexibility of changing the angle to anything you like by using longer bolts to attach the mirror.  In the second  generation Roof Mirror, adjusting the mirror angle is much easier, and in the third generation it is a matter of pressing the buttons on the remote control.</p>
<p>For the calculations of the static and active loads along with the stress tensors we worked with Bias Engineering, an engineering company specialising in such calculations.  Although the mirror is extremely light, a safety factor of 4 was applied so that the mirror and support arms can withstand hurricane-level winds.</p>
<p>As far as manufacturing goes, we are happily partnered with Premier Finishing, a California-based All-American manufacturer with decades of experience in high-tech manufacturing.  They make the support arms and mirror of the Roof Mirror from steel tubes and plexiglas. Future improvements will also be done with the collaboration of Bias Eng. and Premier Finishing. </p>
<p>There are a lot of challenges in starting-up production, and that is why we are here.  First, we want to see that there is a need for this product.  That way we know it is worthwhile for us to put time and effort into the demanding work of supply, production, and distribution setup.  Second, we want to prove to possible investors that there is interest in this product so that they will give us the funds necessary to setup production and finalize legal work.  This will also pave the way for the research and development efforts for the fourth generation Roof Mirror, which will take in the order of million dollars. </p>
<p>Since our biggest challenge is working with a limited marketting budget, your help in getting our voice out there by liking us on Facebook, tweeting, blogging, or chatting about us during coffee breaks would be highly appreciated!  We look forward to delivering a bombastic product that will brighten rooms up. </p>
<p>After the initial fundings we will also spend more money to make a much cooler product video!

The Project
Sun Giant Energy is a social enterprise that will operate in Liberia to bring safe, affordable, and reliable solar energy solutions to the region. With less than 1% of Liberians having access to grid electricity, the vast majority rely on dirty, gas-fueled generators and kerosene lamps. Aside from being a serious hazard to both personal and environmental health, the generators and lamps are inefficient and incredibly expensive -- Liberians spend up to 80% of their income on energy! Can you imagine spending up to 8 out of every 10 dollars you earn to power your lights and charge your electronics?
By distributing and maintaining the highest quality solar lanterns and plug-and-play off grid solar systems, we aim to eliminate the need for gasoline and kerosene in households, businesses, schools, and health facilities across Liberia.  Sun Giant Energy will provide financing packages that will save our customers money from day one and allow them to buy and own their system over the course of one to two years.  Once the system is paid for, the energy it produces is free for the lifetime of the product.  Harnessing the power of the sun, we are working with Liberians to create increased financial freedom and energy independence. Our mission is based on the simple but powerful idea that access to reliable, clean energy sources is the steppingstone needed for Liberia to succeed in creating innovative, community-driven development. We’re ready to hit the ground running with a full scale pilot program in January, but we cannot do it without you.
 
Why Solar?
Every day, enough solar energy hits the earth to power all of humanity for an entire year. What if we could take that energy and use it to power positive change in the world?  (We can.) Put simply, solar photovoltaics use sunlight to make electrical current. This technology is safe, reliable, and can power anything from a single lightbulb to an entire building. In Liberia, harvesting one’s own solar fueled electricity means a brighter future for: students who can read and do homework into the night, business owners who can stay open longer, healthcare practitioners who can reliably store vaccines, the millions of people who suffer from respitory diseases caused by indoor air pollution from fossil fuels, and countless others.

Why you? (Yes, YOU!)
We envision a Liberia that will be celebrated for its restored vibrant culture, growing economy and for its access to clean energy, education and healthcare for all citizens. But we need YOUR help to get started. You, right here, right now, have the opportunity to be a part of large-scale systemic change. By backing our pilot, you are igniting the critical step of testing our model and our hypotheses on the ground in Liberia. This will enable us to tweak and adapt our approach to best serve the specific needs of millions of Liberians. Your impact starts now as we prepare for the full scale pilot program this January where we will deliver solar power to a school and a home in Liberia’s capital Monrovia, and to 100 individuals in surrounding villages!Oh, you also get the sweet rewards listed on the side. And our eternal thanks.
 
Okay, you’re into it... but where exactly is your money going? What does Sun Giant need?
100% of the money we raise from this campaign will go to buying as much solar equipment as we can, to shipping, logistical, installation and maintenance costs, to covering the costs of our awesome backer perks, and to partially subsidizing getting our team to Liberia.  Any additional funding we receive beyond our funding goal will go only to buying more solar equipment and increasing our impact on the ground.
 
Love what Sun Giant is doing, but can’t offer any funding?
As students and former students ourselves, we understand that sometimes funding just is not an option.You can help us out in other ways: Roar with the Giant and MAKE SOME NOISE. Help us spread the word. Share our campaign on facebook, twitter, email, tumblr, blogs, reddit, any other social media, with a good old fashioned phone call, and in real life conversations!
 
THANK YOU!
Thanks for reading through, all the way to the bottom, and thanks for your support! If you’d like to learn more about us we encourage you to visit our site and to contact us.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My proposal is simple.  I would like to raise money to provide those children that are forced to spend the holidays in a hospital with some Christmas cheer.  Every penny would go towards Christmas gifts for as many children as we can reach with the money we raise.  All gifts would be anonymous as the only thing we are looking to do is to help these financially burdened parents provide their children with a wonderful Christmas.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Lilla, I'm an environmentalist, artist and completely passionate about the forests of Brazil, regeneration of Earth systems and how collective actions can turn problems into opportunities. My main area of knowledge is Human Ecology, Botanics, Ecological Restoration, Forest Seed Production and, Ecological Food Systems.<br/><br/>The 5 years of undergraduate studies in Environmental Management gave me a good understanding of conventional science, which is clearly important, but not enough to face the complexity of the environmental crisis we are currently facing. <br/><br/>Now, I want to go beyond and join the master programme in Holistic Science at Schumacher College. The MSc will allow me to explore new scientific methodologies and deeply understand the complex dynamics of a living  Earth. For a whole year, I will dive deep into the understanding of the relationship between culture and nature, integrating qualitative and quantitative aspects of the phenomenon.  It's a science that goes beyond science and this holistic approach brings to light a new paradigm, inspiring hope and action to solve the pressing challenges we face.<br/>I want to make all this knowledge accessible for everyone. Therefore, I will make a series of 7 videos titled ""In Service to the Earth"", a learning journey divided into 7 episodes in which I will try to answer ""how can we regenerate the Earth?"". I want to spread hope and sparkle inspiration to shift our culture. </p>
<p>This campaign is an opportunity to do good in the world and start a regenerative culture, it will result in a lot of trees being planted and plastic being collected from the ocean/and land. Little actions can have a huge impact. Find out below.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project has three levels of impact.</p>
<p>1st level of impact - direct impact on ecosystems. </p>
<p>Taking out plastic from the oceans have a direct positive effect on marine ecosystems as plastic is extremely harmful to marine wildlife. Even if I can't take alone all plastic from the oceans alone, I can collect a good amount, and this ""small"" amount can make all the difference at an individual level. I'm already collecting plastic from the ocean and I will keep doing it no matter what, but the campaign will set goals for bigger amounts.</p>
<p>The trees will also have a direct impact on ecosystems, but for a long-term. I want to choose species that can support the wildlife and I will prioritize locations where the trees are needed. Not all trees will survive, but each tree that can grow healthy is worth a lot to ecosystems.</p>
<p>2nd level of impact - hopefully, the series of videos will reach a wide public, inspiring people to take action for the regeneration of the Earth and help to shift to a new paradigm. The knowledge should be available to all.</p>
<p>3rd level of impact - this masters will change my world and inspire a deep level of understanding. I will be able to develop skills to be in service to the Earth, create new solutions for the environmental challenges and in future become an educator for transformative learning.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is an All or Nothing Campaign, which means if I don't reach my goal, all your donation will come back to you.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Why donate to my project so I can pay for my Graduate Degree at Columbia?  </p>
<p>Because by investing in my high education, you are sponsoring one of the future environmental world leaders who will help us navigate the challenges of climate change.  </p>
<p>Which a more worthwhile investment of your money: green technology or my tuition? </p>
<p>Investing and providing funds for green technology is important and a necessary means of jump-starting a new economy and our efforts to change our ways. However, investing in a person like me who has the dedication and motivation as I do for environmental issues is like giving donations to alternative energy projects, restoration projects, conservation projects, and environmental projects.   You get a high rate of return for each dollar donated. During my career, I will be an integral part of 100's if not 1000's of environmental, energy, restoration, and conservation projects.  </p>
<p>Will your donation contribute to a better world? </p>
<p>Yes!  If you think we need the natural world in order to survice as a species and you believe that climate change is a very real and potentially destructive human caused phenomena then this is a project that you can confidently say your money was an investment in your future, your children's future, and their children's future.  </p>
<h3>My Passion</h3>
<p>Knowledge about Climate Change has always been my greatest passion in life.  After a great deal of reflection, I have realized that my dream job would be helping to create the foundations and infrastructure for a mountain of resources and innovation that will help the US adapt to the changes in our climate that will be happening in the next 50 years.  I believe that it will not be just one solution or change, but an entire frame shift of thought.  Such a change would be most effective and timely by creating an Institute for the Education of Environmental Innovators.  We already have many of the proven clean tech solutions — wind, solar, biofuel, geothermal, electric cars, green buildings, smart grid and energy efficiency technologies — we need to do is replicate and scale these solutions through proven green economy companies, projects and substantial investment capital.  I have been accepted to the Earth Institute and Columbia University where I will collaborate, learn, grow, and begin to work with others to create the innovative technologies and knowledge that will create a sustainable future. </p>

<h3>Long Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! Please help me fund my graduate degree so I can help others. I am about to begin a program at Columbia University that is going to give me the skills, knowledge, and connections to create and change environmental/climate initiatives and laws. I have devoted my life to helping other people and making the world a better place and now I am taking the steps to make large scale changes. However, I am still tens of thousands of $ short of the amount of tuition. For me and maybe for our future ability to adapt to climate change, this needs to happen. I work extremely hard and am dedicated to creating a better, more sustainable future that will strengthen our economy and GDP.</p>
<p>It is a year long accelerated program starting May 27 so by May 2014, I will have my Masters of Public Administration in Environmental Science and Policy. It is through the School of International and Public Affairs at CU and they have a 98% job placement within a year of graduating. A year from now, I will already be making a difference because you were gracious enough to believe in me.</p>
<p>I applied to ESP because over the past 5 years, no matter what I've been teaching my kids, I have always found myself connecting it to environmental science, climate change, policy, and social responsibility. I've dreamed about being able to do the kinds of stuff we'll be doing since I was a kid, I just never thought I'd be able to go to school for it or get a high demand/high paying job for it. I found out this past fall that I was wrong and immediate starting applying. I think it's the right time and good things are happening in the world. This is why I know I will find the funding for the program one way or another.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Environmentalism (knowledge of, protection of, use of, and restoration of, etc) is my greatest passion and by joining the program at Columbia, it is now becoming my most dedicated life-long pursuit.</span></p>
<p>My goal is to fund $10,000 from 5 difference sources. Anything you are able to donate will help me reach my goal with this one. If you are feeling particularly generous, visit my other fundraising sites and donote there as well.  Thank you!!!</p>

It is through the School of International and Public Affairs at CU and they have a 98% job placement within a year of graduating. A year from now, I will already be making a difference because you were gracious enough to believe in me.
I applied to ESP because over the past 5 years, no matter what I've been teaching my kids, I have always found myself connecting it to environmental science, climate change, policy, and social responsibility. I've dreamed about being able to do the kinds of stuff we'll be doing since I was a kid, I just never thought I'd be able to go to school for it or get a high demand/high paying job for it. I found out this past fall that I was wrong and immediate starting applying. I think it's the right time and good things are happening in the world. This is why I know I will find the funding for the program one way or another.
Environmentalism (knowledge of, protection of, use of, and restoration of, etc) is my greatest passion and by joining the program at Columbia, it is now becoming my most dedicated life-long pursuit.
My goal is to fund $10,000 from 5 difference sources. Anything you are able to donate will help me reach my goal with this one. If you are feeling particularly generous, visit my other fundraising sites and donote there as well.  Thank you!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p>
<b>This could be the last opportunity to save the nationally known and Historic US 30 dragstrip in Hobart, Indiana (formerly addressed in Gary)</b><br/><br/>I have a signed agreement with the owner to purchase a large section of the US 30 Dragstrip property. Enough land to have a 1/8th mile dragstrip with approximately a 1,400 shut down area.  This area includes the old Tower area, pit area, parking area and grandstands.<br/><br/>US 30 Drag strip has always been a family oriented facility.
A place where Fathers and Mothers worked side by side with their children, where friends bonded working on each others cars in the pits. A place where people came on
dates to watch the races. There are probably millions of people who have
fond memories of their times at US 30 Dragstrip. <br/><br/>
<p>The current property owner has been entertaining offers from developers for residential and industrial usage, which made me realize I had to step in and do everything possible to save the Dragstrip from being destroyed forever.</p>
<p>Please not this campaign ends on July 30th, 2016.<br/></p>
<br/><p>
</p>
<h3>What will be proposed to the City for approval: </h3>
<p>The following will be included in the Proposal to the
City of Hobart (again it is our proposal and has not been approved).</p>
<p>The standard elements of our proposal are:</p>
<p><span>A.<span> 
</span></span>A 1/8<sup>th</sup> mile track</p>
<p><span>B.<span>  </span></span>One weekend day for open racing</p>
<p><span>C.<span> 
</span></span>Friday evening open Test and Tune times</p>
<p>D. Large open sided shelters with picnic tables to give relief from the hot sun with misting stations.<br/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>Our proposal also consists of 3 unprecedented elements in
Drag Racing.</b></p>
<p><b><span>1.<span> 
</span></span>Garage Condominiums</b> from oversized 1 ½ car and larger in
an enclosed secure area next to the pits with a keypad to open the driveway
gate and secured wrought iron type of fencing. They could be heated and air
conditioned with a lift. It is a great opportunity to have some place to store
your race car, work on it 365 days a year in a temperature controlled
environment. There is also over 2 blocks of land the owner wants to sell as light industrial which will mean 20' to 25' tall concrete block constrution buildings for blocks between the track and the houses at the west end. Concrete buildings make a great sound barrier. <br/></p>
<b>2.<span> 
</span>Exclusive Memberships for weekday Test
and Tune</b> (proposed 4pm to 8pm) Numerous other sports have country club membership which allow
its members special exclusive benefits, such as Golf Course Country Clubs, so
why not for Drag Racing? We will propose Test and Tune days on Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday.  Individuals can
purchase memberships for any of the three days which will provide them access
to the dragstrip on that weekday every week the tract is open. We will only
offer a limited number of memberships to allow each racer to have an estimated
6 runs each day. <br/><br/><p><b><span>3.<span> 
</span></span>League Team Racing on One weekend day.</b> Get a group of 5
racers and form your own Drag Racing Team. Team racing will race against other
teams with each winner advancing to the next run. It will be run based on
selected ET with standard rules for red lighting and break outs, there will be
no buy buys in League Racing. Winning Teams will receive weekly Trophies with
an end of the year Banquet. You can design your own Team Shirts, car decals,
logos, etc. There will be a limited number of Teams spots available. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>
<b>What I am Not Proposing:</b><br/>
</h3>
<p><b>I am not proposing</b> Top Fuel Dragstrers/Funny Cars with over 9,000 
horsepower (that's 10 times the horse power of most of the bracket race 
cars we expect at the dragstrip) and they are much, much louder. This 
will eliminate a lot of the noise issues homeowners might be concerned 
about.</p>
<p><b>I am not proposing</b> national events that will attract Tens of Thousands of spectators. I am proposing a local dragstrip where people can have fun with their family and friends. This will also eliminate and/or greatly reduce potential traffic congestion that homeowners might be worried about.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need/What You Get
</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
</div><div>
<p>There are 3 aspects to this project. <br/></p>
<p>1. Raising the money to purchase the land</p>
<p>2. Getting an acceptable approval from the City of Hobart</p>
<p>3. Raising the money to complete the reopening of the dragstrip</p>
<p>I am implementing an unprecedented Perk for the donations one that can be used or given away as a gift. <br/></p>
<p>In turn for a donation we are offering an unprecedented Perk (gift) with a value far beyond what is being donated. We are offering 3 Day / 2 Night Vacations at your choice of over 50 cities around the country or a 8 Day / 7 Night Condominium Vacations at our choice of over 65 locations. These are NOT time share promos they are actual vacations.  The individual is responsible for room tax and a small fee ($12 for the 3 Day/2 Night vacation voucher) See below for more details. <br/></p>
<p>This project will have to reach far beyond the US30 Dragstrip supporters which is why the Vacation vouchers have been selected as a Perk. Who wouldn't be willing to donate $30 for a 3 Day/2 Night Vacation voucher? So please consider placing a link for this project on your facebook page and tell your friends and family. It doesn't matter where they live or if they support Dragracing or not, the vacation locations cover cities throughout the country. The name on the vacation vouchers will be left blank so you can give them away as gifts. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we do not raise enough money to purchase the parcel of land under contract or if acceptable terms can not be reached with the City  there is Plan B: <br/></p>
<p>While this will not allow anyone to race on the property I have discussed the ability of purchasing the front 10 acres fronting on Clay Street which would include the starting line, pit and tower area, etc. There is no way that 10 acres is sufficient to ever race on, but it provides the ability of saving the most important part of the land.. If the amount raised doesn't meet the requirement for Plan B, then Plan C is to have a Documentary produced on the History of US 30 Dragstrip with video interviews with as many of the top names and popular racers from it's Glory days as possible if there is enough money raised to cover it. <br/></p>
<p>Whether you are someone that would like to see the track reopened or someone who just wants it to remain as it is a memory that you can drive by and look down the track remember, this could be the last chance to save the property from becoming another industrial or residential development. With the track torn up and warehouses, office buildings or homes built on the land US 30 Dragstrip could be another racetrack that died in the name of progress.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

This could be the last opportunity to save the nationally known and Historic US 30 dragstrip in Hobart, Indiana (formerly addressed in Gary)I have a signed agreement with the owner to purchase a large section of the US 30 Dragstrip property.

The current property owner has been entertaining offers from developers for residential and industrial usage, which made me realize I had to step in and do everything possible to save the Dragstrip from being destroyed forever.
Please not this campaign ends on July 30th, 2016.


What will be proposed to the City for approval: 
The following will be included in the Proposal to the
City of Hobart (again it is our proposal and has not been approved).
The standard elements of our proposal are:
A. 
A 1/8th mile track
B.  One weekend day for open racing
C. 
Friday evening open Test and Tune times
D. Large open sided shelters with picnic tables to give relief from the hot sun with misting stations.

Our proposal also consists of 3 unprecedented elements in
Drag Racing.

<h3>The 70% Vegan ""V-Shirt""</h3>
<p>Finally, an environmental campaign we can all participate in!</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to judge your friends and family for their dietary choices, but been unable to because you weren't a 100% vegan? Well, the 70% Vegan v-shirt changes all that! With this v-shirt you too will be able to preach to others about saving the environment, while hardly having to change your diet at all. And you'll still be 70% as good as the real thing!</p>
<p>By funding this project you'll not only be helping us to fund our dream, but will also receive kudos for donating to an ""environmental"" cause - allowing you to tell all your friends and become as insufferable as that vegan niece of yours who went vegan that one summer during her first year of college. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585657464/nabquipvwsivdjuvruuv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Why 70%</h3>
<p>Because we love animals. Consider if all the world adopted a 100% vegan lifestyle, and the impact and strain this would have on our precious Earth. Conceivably, greedy humans would keep all the plant-based food for themselves, which would leave nothing for the animals - in turn, animals would resort to survival instincts; reproducing more and looking at humans as a food source. The prospect of carnivorous bunny rabbits, with giant front teeth, was the impetus for our venture - we hope you share our vision for the future.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Due to all of the research and development fees, as well as the stringent prototyping protocols required to print a t-shirt with text across its front, we only need $100,000 from you in order to help us make this a reality. </p>
<p>We thank you in advance for all of your generous donations!</p>

<p>With wings of brilliant hues plying the breezes on a sunny day, butterflies are an ultimate expression of nature's beauty and strength. Like the multitudes of insects species and other creatures, each kind of butterfly fills a unique role in the Web of Life, but butterflies are endangered by environmental change with numerous species suffering drastic recent declines. This project will use kites as a novel medium to teach people about the diversity of our native North American butterflies and ways to get involved in their appreciation and conservation.    </p>
<strong>Why kites?</strong><p>We should seek avenues, new and old, for people to experience, enjoy and learn about nature. The kite line provides the flier with a responsive, direct connection with the same forces and processes that sustain life on earth, while the sail provides a uniquely expressive artistic canvas. Kites bring people outside to see the real world! In Western Society, kites are usually thought of simply as toys, but through play they can stir the imagination for the flyer. As an invention appreciated almost everywhere, the kite can work as a compelling medium for communicating the wonder and beauty of our natural heritage, especially less conspicuous animals such as butterflies. Like the butterflies themselves, the kite designs in this project will cast intricate, captivating butterfly wing patterns against the blue sky.</p>
<p><strong>The Edo Kite</strong><br/>Edo was the former name of present-day Tokyo in the Edo Period (1603-1867) and it was during this time that craftspeople there developed the world’s most refined kite. The Edo is unique among kites for its numerous and very long bridle lines. Other kite designs lend aerodynamic stability with tails, vents or engineered contours, but the Edo flies straight with a different principle: the bridle lines’ mass shifts the kite’s center of gravity several meters forward of the sail. A mathematically-described shape, the bridle catenary forms a graceful, dancing arch between the kite and the kite line tow point. As it sways to and fro, the Edo bridle catenary corrects for shifting breezes to keep the kite steady in the sky. In Japan, the <i>washi</i> mulberry paper sails are sometimes decorated with rich, narrative illustrations that reflect both a reverence for tradition and individual creativity. In a singular way, the Edo kite draws together the love of nature with the power of human imagination.</p>

<p><strong>Specifics</strong><br/>This campaign will support the purchase of <u>kitebuilding materials,</u> an <u>action camera</u> and <u>greeting card custom printing</u>. Photoshop sketches (see images) have resolved kite designs honoring two endangered butterfly species, while I will complete four more to assemble a complete series of project kites. The sail designs are rendered in reverse appliqué, a sewing technique that creates a striking stained glass effect with bright sunshine illuminating the radiant colors of the kites in flight.</p>
<p>After building the kites, we will make use of them in these ways to communicate appreciation and conservation of endangered butterflies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Event flights</u> - the kites will fly at local environmental education events, as well as public kite festivals. A printed 1/2-sheet flyer will convey details on the butterfly species and their conservation, as well as the unique history and construction of the Edo kite.     </li>
<li>
<u>Gallery shows</u> - two local organizations have expressed interest in showing the  kite series in their gallery spaces. The luminous quality of the reverse appliqué sails and the elegant Edo kite spar &amp; bridle configuration also lend themselves to appealing indoor display.</li>
<li>
<u>Video production</u> - we will use video clips of kite flights and wild butterflies in their habitats to produce a video for online publication. This video can also play as a loop on a monitor set up with the gallery show. </li>
<li>
<u>Greeting cards</u> - we will select three of our best photographs of flying kites to print as folded greeting cards.  These cards will include a printed message on the back cover describing the kite, the butterfly species and species conservation. Greeting card sets are listed as one of the campaign perk options.</li>
</ul>
<p>The kite sail designs will use the wing patterns of these six butterfly species:</p>

<li>Early Hairstreak (<i>Erora laeta</i>)</li>
<li>Frosted Elfin (<i>Callophrys irus</i>)</li>

<p>All of these butterflies occur in our area, the Upper Midwest, USA. The Karner Blue kite is already built (see photos and campaign video). The first five species are protected with the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) and/or state endangered species listings. The Monarch—once North America's most abundant butterfly—has suffered precipitous declines in recent years and its legal status with possible ESA listing is currently in review by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service.  While most people are familiar with the Monarch, the other butterflies are less conspicuous animals that live in more specialized and endangered habitats. This project provides a new way for people to find out about these lesser-known butterflies.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong><br/>There is great urgency for the task of teaching people about these butterflies and other endangered species. The pressures that have led to their declines, such as habitat destruction, pesticide use and climate change have continued or accelerated.  Legal protections that have saved these species and many others, including the ESA and state endangered resources authorities, are themselves gravely imperiled by recent political changes. These kites will present the beauty of these animals along with a few scientific details in a memorable, uplifting way and encourage people to learn more about butterflies and participate in their conservation—the overarching goal for this project.</p>
<p>We hope that this project will also promote interest in kitebuilding, kite flying and single-line kites. There are few activities more restorative and fun than going outside to fly a kite on a beautiful day. The campaign backer perks include handmade kites of original design and a few other items to use for flying kites. </p>

<p><strong>Campaign Backer Perks</strong><br/>Scroll down to see pictures of these items. Look in the page margin to click the backer perk links.</p>
<p>For the most basic backer level ($7+) I will shoot the best photograph of one of the new kites in flight that I can for printing as a (<u>Thank You!</u>) postcard and mail it to you. Backers contributing at this level and higher will also receive a personal thank you on the Moonwort Studio Website project page.</p>
<p>The <u>Washi &amp; Bamboo Kite Kit</u> ($19) includes all of the materials you need to build a mini (11"" X 8"") butterfly kite. The washi mulberrry paper sheet is printed with the kite pattern and a complete instruction sheet is also included. This kite is pretty easy to build, but requires some detailed work to attach the spars and bridle. For ages 12-adult.      </p>
<p>The <u>Kite Line Winder</u> ($16) and <u>Larger Kite Line Winder</u> ($21) will work well with any homemade or commercial kite. Use the former with 20-50 lb. kite line and small (&lt;36"") kites and use the latter with larger (&gt;36"") kites and 20-150 lb. kite line. These plywood winders are more enjoyable to use in comparison with the common plastic hoop winders.</p>
<p>We will gather three of our best kite photographs to custom print three unique 5.5"" X 4"" folded <u>Greeting Cards</u> with envelopes and pack these as a set of fifteen to ship to you at the $20 level. The card inside folded spaces will be blank for your personalized messages, but the back covers will include notes describing the endangered butterfly species and the kite.</p>
<p>The <u>Smaller Handmade Kite</u> ($180) will use one of the project butterfly motifs to sew a sail for a kite finished and bridled as a 22"" X 33"" Ohashi Variant Edo. This kind of kite has just three spars and a 2-leg bridle, so it is much easier to assemble and fly in comparison with a traditional Edo. I will also pack one of the plywood kite line winders, 250' of 20 lb. kite line, a carrying bag and a repair kit with the Smaller Handmade Kite.</p>
<p>The <u>Handmade Kite</u> ($350) will use one of the butterfly motifs to sew an additional sail for a kite finished and bridled as an Ohashi Variant Edo with the same dimensions (34"" X 52"") as the project kites. This kind of kite has just three spars and a 2-leg bridle, so it is much easier to assemble and fly in comparison with a traditional Edo. I will also pack one of the plywood kite line winders, 500' of 50 lb. kite line and a repair kit with the Handmade Kite.</p>

Like the multitudes of insects species and other creatures, each kind of butterfly fills a unique role in the Web of Life, but butterflies are endangered by environmental change with numerous species suffering drastic recent declines. This project will use kites as a novel medium to teach people about the diversity of our native North American butterflies and ways to get involved in their appreciation and conservation.    
Why kites?We should seek avenues, new and old, for people to experience, enjoy and learn about nature. The kite line provides the flier with a responsive, direct connection with the same forces and processes that sustain life on earth, while the sail provides a uniquely expressive artistic canvas. Kites bring people outside to see the real world! In Western Society, kites are usually thought of simply as toys, but through play they can stir the imagination for the flyer. As an invention appreciated almost everywhere, the kite can work as a compelling medium for communicating the wonder and beauty of our natural heritage, especially less conspicuous animals such as butterflies. Like the butterflies themselves, the kite designs in this project will cast intricate, captivating butterfly wing patterns against the blue sky.
The Edo KiteEdo was the former name of present-day Tokyo in the Edo Period (1603-1867) and it was during this time that craftspeople there developed the world’s most refined kite. The Edo is unique among kites for its numerous and very long bridle lines. Other kite designs lend aerodynamic stability with tails, vents or engineered contours, but the Edo flies straight with a different principle: the bridle lines’ mass shifts the kite’s center of gravity several meters forward of the sail. A mathematically-described shape, the bridle catenary forms a graceful, dancing arch between the kite and the kite line tow point. As it sways to and fro, the Edo bridle catenary corrects for shifting breezes to keep the kite steady in the sky. In Japan, the washi mulberry paper sails are sometimes decorated with rich, narrative illustrations that reflect both a reverence for tradition and individual creativity. In a singular way, the Edo kite draws together the love of nature with the power of human imagination.
Below, a wild Karner Blue (top), sail design drawing from Karner Blue hindwing pattern (left) and completed Edo kite on the flying field (right).


SpecificsThis campaign will support the purchase of kitebuilding materials, an action camera and greeting card custom printing. Photoshop sketches (see images) have resolved kite designs honoring two endangered butterfly species, while I will complete four more to assemble a complete series of project kites. The sail designs are rendered in reverse appliqué, a sewing technique that creates a striking stained glass effect with bright sunshine illuminating the radiant colors of the kites in flight.
After building the kites, we will make use of them in these ways to communicate appreciation and conservation of endangered butterflies:


Event flights - the kites will fly at local environmental education events, as well as public kite festivals. A printed 1/2-sheet flyer will convey details on the butterfly species and their conservation, as well as the unique history and construction of the Edo kite.     

Gallery shows - two local organizations have expressed interest in showing the  kite series in their gallery spaces. The luminous quality of the reverse appliqué sails and the elegant Edo kite spar & bridle configuration also lend themselves to appealing indoor display.

Video production - we will use video clips of kite flights and wild butterflies in their habitats to produce a video for online publication. This video can also play as a loop on a monitor set up with the gallery show. 

Greeting cards - we will select three of our best photographs of flying kites to print as folded greeting cards.  These cards will include a printed message on the back cover describing the kite, the butterfly species and species conservation. Greeting card sets are listed as one of the campaign perk options.

The kite sail designs will use the wing patterns of these six butterfly species:

Early Hairstreak (Erora laeta)
Frosted Elfin (Callophrys irus)
Karner Blue (Plebejus melissa samuelis)
Poweshiek Skipperling (Oarisma poweshiek)
Regal Fritillary (Speyeria adalia)
Monarch (Danaus plexipus)

All of these butterflies occur in our area, the Upper Midwest, USA. The Karner Blue kite is already built (see photos and campaign video). The first five species are protected with the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) and/or state endangered species listings. The Monarch—once North America's most abundant butterfly—has suffered precipitous declines in recent years and its legal status with possible ESA listing is currently in review by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.  While most people are familiar with the Monarch, the other butterflies are less conspicuous animals that live in more specialized and endangered habitats.

But I have also accepted that certain realities make it impossible to live utterly plastic free. It is useful stuff, you have to admit. So from that; the only logical conclusion is to promote reduced consumption!</p>
<p>And that is exactly what we intend to do.</p>

I came here for the ski-ing and stayed (it is that good). I've started and run language schools, real-estate offices and built houses. I've designed packages for unique frozen food products and marketed a unique freezing technology used for medical cryo-preservation. My passion has always been design and manufacturing. It is simply the most gratifying thing on the world. Now that I am a Father, the second most gratifying thing. I have 2 boys now, and I really want to create something that will ensure that the world they grow up in will be just that little bit better. </p>

Well, more of a guerilla insurgency. Sun Tsu said ""When faced with overwhelming odds never attack head on"". Our goal is not to eliminate PET bottle sales, but to chip away at them. Each WaterPill represents 280 bottles NOT polluting our environment. It also represents 280 bottles not being produced and 280 bottles worth of profit not reaching corporate pockets.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Use of funds</h2>
<p>We'll be using the funds for purchasing the steel injection molds, finalizing packaging design, funding a minimum first order from the manufacturer, paying the PR people to spread the word and the numerous other small expenses incurred by start-ups. I know what I'm doing when it comes to manufacturing. I've been involved in designing and manufacturing numerous products ranging from sea urchin freezer packs to a patented micro wave frozen sushi tray (no kidding!!!! I'm a co-patent holder on that).</p>
<h2>Is it easy to make this product?</h2>
<p>Oh yes it is. A BIC pen, a symbol of mass produced simplicity, has 9 components. This product has 4. It couldn't get any simpler. It was also designed in conjunction with a manufacturer of injection molded water filtration devices. Essntially there should be no surprises as after we get funded we work out a minimum order, agree on terms, and away we go.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p> </p>
<h2>How long can I use it for?</h2>
<p>It depends on the quality of the water you use, but for average low quality city water you can expect 2 to 3 months of brilliant clean and odor free water.</p>
<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<p>Fill your bottle. Shake for 5 seconds then gently swirl the water.</p>
<h2>How long does it take to clean water?</h2>
<p>Time depends on the quality of water being used. Trust your taste buds.</p>
<h2>Why do I have to swirl the water?</h2>
<p>You don’t have to swirl the water. Natural convection will do the job.  But swirling the water forces it through the specially designed intake vents and forces it over the activated carbon filter.  The more you swirl the water the cleaner it becomes.</p>
<h2>Is there a benefit to swirling?</h2>
<p>Yes! Swirling the water is a form of exercise.  Rotating your wrist is an effective exercise against carpal tunnel syndrome and reduces neck stress. It is recommended for computer users, racquet sports and golf. It is also a Yoga exercise. You get brilliant clean water and mind.</p>

<h2>What does Magnesium do for me?</h2>
<p>Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the human body and an essential mineral playing a key role in many biological processes through its function in enzyme activities. It also creates great tasting mineral water. Up to 70% of people are magnesium deficient according to the World health Organization.</p>
<h2>How do I replace the filters?</h2>
<p>Simply pop off the cover plates, replace the old filter bags and snap the cover plates back on.  And you have another 2 to 3 months of brilliant clean and delicious tap water.</p>
<h2>What does theWaterBean™ contain?</h2>
<p>theWaterBean contains granulated all natural activated coconut carbon, the best quality carbon available and totally safe if ingested. Magnesium calcite, essentially granulated shells, is also added to slowly release minerals and improve the flavor of tap water. This is also completely safe if accidentally ingested.</p>
<h2>Can I use it for drinking from rivers and lakes?</h2>
<p>No! theWaterBean is for removing the bad taste and odors from tap water. It is for saving the world from being polluted by PET bottles and is not a survival tool for the zombie apocalypse.</p>
<h2>Environmental impact of this product?</h2>
<p>Your waterpill filter can replace 140 liters of bottled water or 280 bottles. That’s two large shopping carts full of plastic bottles. Our product is manufactured from BPA free materials.</p>
<h2>Can I compost the filter bags when I am finished with them?</h2>
<p>Absolutely! Carbon and Calcium make excellent compost materials. Cut open the bag and empty the contents on your favorite patch.</p>

read what makes us unique 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Why?
I have always been passionate about the environment and have always been amazed and terrified at how much plastic waste we generate daily. But I have also accepted that certain realities make it impossible to live utterly plastic free. It is useful stuff, you have to admit. So from that; the only logical conclusion is to promote reduced consumption!
And that is exactly what we intend to do.
Who am I?
I'm a Scottish / Canadian serial entrepreneur living in Hokkaido, Japan. I came here for the ski-ing and stayed (it is that good). I've started and run language schools, real-estate offices and built houses. I've designed packages for unique frozen food products and marketed a unique freezing technology used for medical cryo-preservation. My passion has always been design and manufacturing. It is simply the most gratifying thing on the world. Now that I am a Father, the second most gratifying thing. I have 2 boys now, and I really want to create something that will ensure that the world they grow up in will be just that little bit better. 
 
Plastic PET bottles!
We are declaring war on PET bottles. Well, more of a guerilla insurgency. Sun Tsu said ""When faced with overwhelming odds never attack head on"". Our goal is not to eliminate PET bottle sales, but to chip away at them. Each WaterPill represents 280 bottles NOT polluting our environment. It also represents 280 bottles not being produced and 280 bottles worth of profit not reaching corporate pockets.
 
 
Use of funds
We'll be using the funds for purchasing the steel injection molds, finalizing packaging design, funding a minimum first order from the manufacturer, paying the PR people to spread the word and the numerous other small expenses incurred by start-ups. I know what I'm doing when it comes to manufacturing. I've been involved in designing and manufacturing numerous products ranging from sea urchin freezer packs to a patented micro wave frozen sushi tray (no kidding!!!! I'm a co-patent holder on that).
Is it easy to make this product?
Oh yes it is. A BIC pen, a symbol of mass produced simplicity, has 9 components. This product has 4. It couldn't get any simpler. It was also designed in conjunction with a manufacturer of injection molded water filtration devices. Essntially there should be no surprises as after we get funded we work out a minimum order, agree on terms, and away we go.
 
 
FAQs
 
How long can I use it for?
It depends on the quality of the water you use, but for average low quality city water you can expect 2 to 3 months of brilliant clean and odor free water.
How do I use it?
Fill your bottle. Shake for 5 seconds then gently swirl the water.
How long does it take to clean water?
Time depends on the quality of water being used. Trust your taste buds.
Why do I have to swirl the water?
You don’t have to swirl the water. Natural convection will do the job.  But swirling the water forces it through the specially designed intake vents and forces it over the activated carbon filter.  The more you swirl the water the cleaner it becomes.

In 1933, he created the revolutionary 8-directional railway map of the transport lines in London. At a glance, it was no more than a simple 2D drawing made of straight lines, sharp angles, and tiny spheres. There were virtually no geographic elements. Most of the stations were spaced equally apart despite this being far from representative of the varying distances over London’s landscape. What it did display clearly though was each railway line and where they intersected, layering one upon the other in an easy to read manner.</p><p>Beck’s superiors were not impressed. This was not standard protocol for the engineering minds behind the original maps. His idea was too phenomenal. Beck persisted, however, and samples hit the streets. Its popularity grew exponentially and within the month, a large copy was requested and printed.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622538896/wyzwrjoiofylalqev4no.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Check out more about Harry Beck and his concept.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Beck"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Beck</a></p><p> </p><p>Nowadays, this template is so widely recognized, distributed and reworked that it has become the norm. Close to every railway map of our modern world is produced in some variation of Beck’s original. He created a legend and we are experiencing the life-changing effects of his design here and now.</p><p>Inspired by Beck’s story, Chan decided to embark on a journey to create an equally radical masterpiece of his own. A mechanism that would change the very essence of telling time.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622538965/iofjv7ojptxxcuditlyr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>LS01 is the product of this journey. Deeply inspired by Beck’s legacy, Chan reinterpreted his map into the form of a tasteful timepiece. Eight directional lines and circles ripple out from the centre of the LS01. Weaving, layering, and intersecting in a topological fashion, they are the tracks on a railway map. These, in turn, span several vertical levels as the tunnels do underground. A ‘station’ in the form of two rotating discs sits on top. Chan finishes this rendition of mechanical beauty with the exposing of the inner gears.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622539011/k26dkvxxie9nqwcfqj2o.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>This is a watch like no other. The design combines the 2D view of a map with the 3D elements of a cross-section. Paired with an entirely new time telling system, it has no parallel. The moment the watch is wound, this sensation is brought to life. The gears grind, discs turn, and the railway system operates full steam ahead. Close and intimate is the best way to admire the spectacle and wonder of this piece.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622539043/y5eqsyllink3kc3p9zut.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>When Harry Beck created his map, he was working from an electrical schematic. With the smarts of an engineer and the creativity of a designing mind, the product was both aesthetically pleasing and useful. LORESUM’s first watch, the LS01 is based on the same concept. Combining the modern (3D) with the classic (2D) along with the artistry of a graphic designer, we developed the masterpiece Chan envisioned.</p><p> </p><h3>Unique: Made from Scratch</h3><p>Unique and original. Those are the two qualities LORESUM wanted to achieve. Every part of Chan’s watches is made from scratch. They are custom made and specifically manufactured for his designs. There are no premade parts used at any point in the watchmaking process. For this reason, the development time takes more than 3 times that of a normal watch. The number of testing models, CNC testing parts as well as molding fees used are countless and costly. We left no room for compromise, spending days and nights on end to make this watch come true. Our only goal was to create something perfectly original.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622539094/qckejfxxeo2pvnjo0uzd.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>The Movement: Slim and Powerful</h3><p>The heart of a watch lies in its movement. And, in turn, the quality of the heart dictates the same of the timepiece.</p><p>LORESUM wants to give only the best. We are backed by a factory with more than 10 years of experience in watchmaking. They’ve produced a variety of both Swiss and Japanese movements throughout their history. For the LS01, we chose to use the Miyota 9015.</p><p>This Japanese movement is slim but high performing. Despite it being only 3.9mm in thickness and 26mm in diameter, it contains 24 jewels and boasts a frequency of 4Hz (28, 800 A/h). It also has a 42 hour power reserve, automatic winding, and sweep second movement. Not to be deterred by its many functions, the Miyota 9015 is stable and reliable. It’s a first-rate movement limited to elite watches that LORESUM is willing to pay for.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622539121/qlqpbpgcundkngv78ua8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>The Module: a new Time Telling Experience</h3><p>Our watch uses a distinct in-house module made of 26 unique parts. It sits on top of the movement and each piece was developed by the same team behind Behrens Original’s watches. They are a group of talented individuals well versed in making innovative yet reliable mechanisms.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622539197/lajhoih6cgwpmdozfkll.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Our goal was to invent a time-telling experience exclusive to our watches. So we started from the basics and separated the hour and minute hands from the centre axis. Replacing the hands with sapphire crystal discs, we placed the hour indicator on the left and the minute on the right.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622539216/pqejpsq3al4lpaaf63ho.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622539235/uimv2fa9hgeazkjadxeh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The exact minute and hour is indicated by a dotted marker on the perimeter of both discs.

<li>Unique designed bearing is used. The whole weight of the mechanism is hung onto the bearing system developed by us, and thus, very little turning force is needed to turn the whole mechanism.</li>
<li>The turning force is very little and the accuracy of the watch will not be affected. It is as normal as pushing normal watch hands.</li>
<li>Gravitation will not affect the accuracy of the movement as our whole system is hung onto the bearing system, mounted directly onto the dial.</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>Sapphire Crystal: High Scratch Resistance</h3><p>To preserve and prolong the life of our watches, we chose to use sapphire crystals to protect both the front and back of the LS01. This crystal is known for its scratch resistant properties. On the Mohs scale, it reaches a score of 9 in hardness, making it more than ideal for our purposes. To optimize the durability of our watch, the minute and hour discs are made of sapphire as well.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622539304/a4k9tsj5r7eukpnmwtjb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>The Case: Multi-polishing</h3><p>Nothing introduces an excellent watch better than its case. One look over can tell a watch expert a lot about its quality. The LS01 comes in a 316L stainless steel case, a material commonly used in high-end watches. Our rose gold models are plated using a 4-8㎛ ion plating (IP) process for a more durable yet affordable coating.</p><p>We finish our watch cases using multi-polishing techniques to give you the best results we can. The bezel and 45-degree diamond edge on the LS01 are applied with mirror finishing while the rest of the watch is finished with vertical and circular brushes. These two techniques combined bring out the layers in our timepiece. Although the process is costly and time-consuming, the results are worth it.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622539331/eoawqpyc58clibx1l2ln.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>The Strap: Top-Notch Luxury Leather and Interchanging Pin</h3><p>Perfection demands the best and LORESUM won’t settle for less. To match the excellence of our watches, we offer 2 options for comfortable wear. The standard strap we provide is made from Italian calf leather. This is a high-grade leather that is both soft and durable, making it a perfect match for our timepiece. Each strap is exquisitely crafted and pleasing to the touch.</p><p>Our second option is made by American company, Horween Leather Co. With more than 100 years of history, they are seasoned veterans in leather manufacturing and a well-known name in the watch strap industry. Unlike the Italian calf strap, the Horween leather strap has a more oily texture with an aniline finish.</p><p>All of our straps are made with an interchanging pin that allows for easy removal and replacement. Simply push and hold the pin in the unlock position, remove and/or insert the strap into the lugs of the watches, and release. No extra tools are necessary.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622539370/jfpiqpkmlozp2rdamtob.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622539402/f7d1bdjxla7zdd3xslqv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Accuracy: Staying On Time</h3><p>LORESUM specializes in watch modification and movement tuning. Many things can be lost in such processes and accuracy is one of them. To prevent such losses, the parts are put through rigorous testing before each stage of assembly. The whole procedure takes a full week per watch.</p><p>Day 1</p><ul>
<li>The movement is wound to its full capacity</li>
<li>5 positions are tested: crown left, crown up, crown down, dial up, dial down</li>
<li>After a 24 hour rest period, the movement is retested in the same positions<br/> </li>
</ul><p>Day 3</p><ul>
<li>The watch is assembled and put into an auto-winding machine</li>
<li>In its fully wound state, the watch is tested like the movement was in its 5 positions</li>
<li>The watch is set aside for a 24 hour rest period<br/> </li>
</ul><p>Day 5</p><ul><li>Day 3 procedures are repeated<br/> </li></ul><p>Day 7</p><ul><li>The watch is wound and tested one last time before packaging<br/> </li></ul><p>This procedure is not an industry standard. Where other companies stopped at 3 position testing, LORESUM raised the bar up 2 notches. We keep our watch accuracy within the range of -20 to +20 seconds/day. To maintain this standard, the extra testing time is necessary. The LS01 design samples endured an additional 9 month period of on-wrist testing prior to this launch.</p><p>All of our efforts were made to guarantee that an original and perfect watch makes it to your door. One that is durable, stable, reliable, and accurate.

He specializes in the watchmaking process along with the development and design of unique time-telling systems.In December 2017, Chan’s very first brand JW Watch made its debut. Through his efforts the company grew, firmly establishing its place in the watchmaking industry. His iconic models JW-01 and JW-02 are still out of stock to this day. Following this endeavour, he joined the Behrens Original team as a designer for several of their watches. Learning from a mature development team, Jason further expanded his knowledge of watch mechanics and in particular his experience working with high-quality modules.“I want LORESUM to be designer oriented,” said Jason. “As many companies think in a business way, I want mine to be real creative. Not only playing around with the dials colours, materials, but also going for an innovative wristwatch experience.”In tandem with creativity, LORESUM upholds a cost efficient, affordable, and reliable mindset. This is the least we hope to achieve as a professional watchmaking company. Combined with our expertise in design and mechanics, we want to bring you something original. Design Concept: the Harry Beck SensationIf you are a graphic designer then you’ve heard of Harry Beck. In 1933, he created the revolutionary 8-directional railway map of the transport lines in London. At a glance, it was no more than a simple 2D drawing made of straight lines, sharp angles, and tiny spheres. There were virtually no geographic elements. Most of the stations were spaced equally apart despite this being far from representative of the varying distances over London’s landscape. What it did display clearly though was each railway line and where they intersected, layering one upon the other in an easy to read manner.Beck’s superiors were not impressed. This was not standard protocol for the engineering minds behind the original maps. His idea was too phenomenal. Beck persisted, however, and samples hit the streets. Its popularity grew exponentially and within the month, a large copy was requested and printed.Check out more about Harry Beck and his concept.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Beck Nowadays, this template is so widely recognized, distributed and reworked that it has become the norm. Close to every railway map of our modern world is produced in some variation of Beck’s original. He created a legend and we are experiencing the life-changing effects of his design here and now.Inspired by Beck’s story, Chan decided to embark on a journey to create an equally radical masterpiece of his own. A mechanism that would change the very essence of telling time.LS01 is the product of this journey. Deeply inspired by Beck’s legacy, Chan reinterpreted his map into the form of a tasteful timepiece. Eight directional lines and circles ripple out from the centre of the LS01. Weaving, layering, and intersecting in a topological fashion, they are the tracks on a railway map. These, in turn, span several vertical levels as the tunnels do underground. A ‘station’ in the form of two rotating discs sits on top. Chan finishes this rendition of mechanical beauty with the exposing of the inner gears.This is a watch like no other. The design combines the 2D view of a map with the 3D elements of a cross-section. Paired with an entirely new time telling system, it has no parallel. The moment the watch is wound, this sensation is brought to life. The gears grind, discs turn, and the railway system operates full steam ahead. Close and intimate is the best way to admire the spectacle and wonder of this piece.When Harry Beck created his map, he was working from an electrical schematic. With the smarts of an engineer and the creativity of a designing mind, the product was both aesthetically pleasing and useful. LORESUM’s first watch, the LS01 is based on the same concept. Combining the modern (3D) with the classic (2D) along with the artistry of a graphic designer, we developed the masterpiece Chan envisioned. Unique: Made from ScratchUnique and original. Those are the two qualities LORESUM wanted to achieve. Every part of Chan’s watches is made from scratch. They are custom made and specifically manufactured for his designs. There are no premade parts used at any point in the watchmaking process. For this reason, the development time takes more than 3 times that of a normal watch. The number of testing models, CNC testing parts as well as molding fees used are countless and costly. We left no room for compromise, spending days and nights on end to make this watch come true. Our only goal was to create something perfectly original. The Movement: Slim and PowerfulThe heart of a watch lies in its movement. And, in turn, the quality of the heart dictates the same of the timepiece.LORESUM wants to give only the best. We are backed by a factory with more than 10 years of experience in watchmaking. They’ve produced a variety of both Swiss and Japanese movements throughout their history. For the LS01, we chose to use the Miyota 9015.This Japanese movement is slim but high performing. Despite it being only 3.9mm in thickness and 26mm in diameter, it contains 24 jewels and boasts a frequency of 4Hz (28, 800 A/h). It also has a 42 hour power reserve, automatic winding, and sweep second movement. Not to be deterred by its many functions, the Miyota 9015 is stable and reliable. It’s a first-rate movement limited to elite watches that LORESUM is willing to pay for. The Module: a new Time Telling ExperienceOur watch uses a distinct in-house module made of 26 unique parts. It sits on top of the movement and each piece was developed by the same team behind Behrens Original’s watches. They are a group of talented individuals well versed in making innovative yet reliable mechanisms.Our goal was to invent a time-telling experience exclusive to our watches. So we started from the basics and separated the hour and minute hands from the centre axis. Replacing the hands with sapphire crystal discs, we placed the hour indicator on the left and the minute on the right.The exact minute and hour is indicated by a dotted marker on the perimeter of both discs. At night, the space beneath this area glows to illuminate the time. The nook is filled with Swiss Super-LumiNova® BGW9 to ensure maximum visibility even in the dark. The Turning Force
Unique designed bearing is used. The whole weight of the mechanism is hung onto the bearing system developed by us, and thus, very little turning force is needed to turn the whole mechanism.
The turning force is very little and the accuracy of the watch will not be affected. It is as normal as pushing normal watch hands.
Gravitation will not affect the accuracy of the movement as our whole system is hung onto the bearing system, mounted directly onto the dial.
 Sapphire Crystal: High Scratch ResistanceTo preserve and prolong the life of our watches, we chose to use sapphire crystals to protect both the front and back of the LS01. This crystal is known for its scratch resistant properties. On the Mohs scale, it reaches a score of 9 in hardness, making it more than ideal for our purposes. To optimize the durability of our watch, the minute and hour discs are made of sapphire as well. The Case: Multi-polishingNothing introduces an excellent watch better than its case. One look over can tell a watch expert a lot about its quality. The LS01 comes in a 316L stainless steel case, a material commonly used in high-end watches. Our rose gold models are plated using a 4-8㎛ ion plating (IP) process for a more durable yet affordable coating.We finish our watch cases using multi-polishing techniques to give you the best results we can. The bezel and 45-degree diamond edge on the LS01 are applied with mirror finishing while the rest of the watch is finished with vertical and circular brushes. These two techniques combined bring out the layers in our timepiece. Although the process is costly and time-consuming, the results are worth it. The Strap: Top-Notch Luxury Leather and Interchanging PinPerfection demands the best and LORESUM won’t settle for less. To match the excellence of our watches, we offer 2 options for comfortable wear. The standard strap we provide is made from Italian calf leather. This is a high-grade leather that is both soft and durable, making it a perfect match for our timepiece. Each strap is exquisitely crafted and pleasing to the touch.Our second option is made by American company, Horween Leather Co. With more than 100 years of history, they are seasoned veterans in leather manufacturing and a well-known name in the watch strap industry. Unlike the Italian calf strap, the Horween leather strap has a more oily texture with an aniline finish.All of our straps are made with an interchanging pin that allows for easy removal and replacement. Simply push and hold the pin in the unlock position, remove and/or insert the strap into the lugs of the watches, and release. No extra tools are necessary. Accuracy: Staying On TimeLORESUM specializes in watch modification and movement tuning. Many things can be lost in such processes and accuracy is one of them. To prevent such losses, the parts are put through rigorous testing before each stage of assembly. The whole procedure takes a full week per watch.Day 1
The movement is wound to its full capacity
5 positions are tested: crown left, crown up, crown down, dial up, dial down
After a 24 hour rest period, the movement is retested in the same positions 
Day 3
The watch is assembled and put into an auto-winding machine
In its fully wound state, the watch is tested like the movement was in its 5 positions
The watch is set aside for a 24 hour rest period 
Day 5Day 3 procedures are repeated Day 7The watch is wound and tested one last time before packaging This procedure is not an industry standard. Where other companies stopped at 3 position testing, LORESUM raised the bar up 2 notches. We keep our watch accuracy within the range of -20 to +20 seconds/day. To maintain this standard, the extra testing time is necessary. The LS01 design samples endured an additional 9 month period of on-wrist testing prior to this launch.All of our efforts were made to guarantee that an original and perfect watch makes it to your door. One that is durable, stable, reliable, and accurate. This is what LORESUM watches are. WarrantyLORESUM employs watch masters that perform and monitor quality checks in our factory every day. None of our watches are shipped without passing through all procedures. That being said, we do include a 2-year warranty for your assurance.

It is therefore a robust and reliable movement. Being a ""strong and very reliable movement"", it has no finishes or aspects aimed at particularly increasing its prestige, compared to the high-end movements. This movement guarantees great reliability and good precision at a competitive price. Nevertheless, in our case, the caliber has been embellished with a specific customization that includes an ""IP Yellow Gold"" plating for the rotor, and a laser engraving on the visible part of the oscillating weight.</p><p>The diameter is 27.4 mm and the thickness is 5.32 mm. The rotor charges bidirectionally and the power reserve is 41 hours. It features a date at 3 o'clock, machine stop and the ability to wind it manually, unlike the 7s26 caliber which does not provide the possibility of manual winding.</p><p>The claimed accuracy stands at an error of -35/+ 40 seconds per day; however, when properly tuned, its performance is usually closer to -15/+ 15 seconds per day. It operates at a frequency of 21600 oscillations per hour, therefore an average frequency. The shock protection system is the Diashock, which is the standard shock protection system adopted by Seiko.

A limited and numbered collection: for each series we propose 11 chronograph models and 11 automatic models. A total of 300 numbered pieces with chrono movements and 300 numbered pieces with automatic movements.

Years 40's: an icon of watchmaking was born. Year 2020: the legend reinvents itself in a contemporary fashion. We were inspired by an icon of the past, a model of the 30's - 40's that is still among the most sought after by collectors all over the world. A timepiece that has made the history of watchmaking, a timeless, legendary icon. We transported it into the 21st century, modernizing it just enough to make it even more immortal in the memory of all those who have seen, worn or even dreamed of it. From unattainable, we will make it available to all those who have always wanted it. Its shape, style and charisma are now featuring in this new model. We developed two models, a chronograph with a hybrid mechanical quartz movement, and an automatic custom movement only time. A product conceived, designed and created with passion, and to which we dedicated a refined attention to detail. Discover with us this new Italian proposal that revives, updating it, a timeless icon of wrist watchmaking. A ""must have"" within everyone's reach. We restyled its external layout, blending it with an iconic new brand that is meant to be a tribute to the millennial history of the amazing Italian city of Verona.

 
   The movement Seiko NH35 (or NH35A) is a 24-jewel automatic caliber based on the 7s26. It is therefore a robust and reliable movement. Being a ""strong and very reliable movement"", it has no finishes or aspects aimed at particularly increasing its prestige, compared to the high-end movements. This movement guarantees great reliability and good precision at a competitive price. Nevertheless, in our case, the caliber has been embellished with a specific customization that includes an ""IP Yellow Gold"" plating for the rotor, and a laser engraving on the visible part of the oscillating weight.The diameter is 27.4 mm and the thickness is 5.32 mm. The rotor charges bidirectionally and the power reserve is 41 hours. It features a date at 3 o'clock, machine stop and the ability to wind it manually, unlike the 7s26 caliber which does not provide the possibility of manual winding.The claimed accuracy stands at an error of -35/+ 40 seconds per day; however, when properly tuned, its performance is usually closer to -15/+ 15 seconds per day. It operates at a frequency of 21600 oscillations per hour, therefore an average frequency. The shock protection system is the Diashock, which is the standard shock protection system adopted by Seiko. The customized rotor, although it may seem a ""trivial"" thing, is actually synonymous with great attention to detail, reflected in all the technical and construction details of ours watches. The movement of the Chronograph models, is a Miyota Cal. OS21-10Z by Citizen Balance Weight  Minute 0.40 μN.m  /  Second 0.11 μN.m  /  Small 0.02 μN.mBattery Life  5 yearsAccuracy  ±20 sec per monthHeight   5.10mmSize   13 1/2’’’Function  Chrono min/sec, 24 hour / DateBasic Steel finishing & Black dial with silver color indexIPGold Steel finishing & Blue dial with gold plating color indexBi-colors IPGold - Steel finishing & Blue dial with gold plating color indexIPRose Gold Steel finishing & Brown dial with Rose gold plating color indexBi-colors IPRose Gold - Steel finishing & Brown dial with Rose gold plating color indexIPGold Steel finishing & Ivory dial with gold plating color indexBasic Steel finishing & Ivory dial with gold plating color indexIPRose Gold Steel finishing & White dial with Rose gold plating color indexBi-colors IPRose Gold - Steel finishing & White dial with Rose gold plating color indexBi-colors IPGold - Steel finishing & Black dial with gold plating color indexBasic Steel finishing & Black dial with gold plating color indexOur First 8 Official AmbassadorsThe ""Pulsometric Scale"" on the dials This is our tribute to all the doctors, nurses and medical staff for this particular and difficult moment, but also a way of reminding everyone how important our health is. Each watch is numbered. Furthermore, we wish to dedicate an even more exclusive and special treat to the most rigorous and detail looking collectors, with the two initial references and the two final references, the two numbers 1 of 300 and the two numbers 300 of 300. This project is truly ItalianVerona is one of the most visited art cities in Italy.

Wandering hour complications are the most sophisticated and intriguing time display in watchmaking. Often reserved for high-end luxury watches, the complexity involved in creating this dedicated movement and its time indicating system easily pushes the price to an unattainable level (most are over $10k). To make wandering hour watches accessible to more people, we have devoted several years of development to create our own exclusive custom movement and now, we are proud to present it in Ettore!Ettore’s appearance impresses all from very first sight. The streamlined glass presents a breathtaking racing track while the case is inspired by the supercar iconic hood design, evoking a feeling of supercar racing and a vision of speed on your wrist.Time reading in Ettore is intuitive yet eye-catching, 4-arm wandering hour hands each with 3 numbered indicators rotating in perfect precision to simultaneously show the Hour and Minute as it sweeps across a numbered indicator.  Combined with the supercar-inspired shell, Ettore is a guaranteed conversation starter!Finished with a Swiss Super-LumiNova coating, Ettore’s curved lines and the numerals on the dial shine distinctively in the dark, which allows you to read the time easily and gives the watch a stylish standout appearance in low lighting.Ettore’s dial and hands are crafted from 3D-printed copper and aviation-grade aluminum. The 3D printing process ensures consistency and superior fitment. The surfaces are covered with Swiss Super-LumiNova coating that enables easy time reading in low light conditions. For those who prefer retrograde style time reading, ATOWAK Ettore Lite is a great choice that retains all the symbolic supercar elements. Its movement is redesigned based on the original MIYOTA 8215 movement.ETTORE LITE  has the same material and strap as Ettore Drift (which means all 6 optional straps can be used in Ettore Lite) and the same functions such as 3ATM waterproof and super luminova coating. But its price is almost half!Super- luminova coating makes ETTORE LITE shine through the dark. Durable 316L stainless steel, which is created through a series of 20 separate pressings and over 50 fine processing steps. Every part of the surface is delicately polished to highlight each stunning facet.

It's a man's most elegant garment when worn right. But I just couldn't find 'the perfect blazer' that I could wear anywhere. The Wool/Polyester-wool blazers looked too overdressed, hot & suffocating. The Linen blazers are breathable but shrink & wrinkle even with the slightest touch. The Cotton blazers, well, they are heavy, stiff, hot, wrinkle easily & are just ugly. So, I dreamt:What if a blazer breathes like no other blazer in human history? What if a blazer doesn't shrink & is so lightweight that it feels like a flower petal? And what if it still has a stunning luxury wool appearance? That would be the most revolutionary & magical blazer that can be worn by everyone, everywhere! Introducing the magnificent MAXIM AIR.You can even choose a perk with a matching set of pants in the same fabric and solid color as your blazer to complete the suit. Naturally better for the environment, our fabric is sustainably made from Austrian beech trees, giving it a smooth texture that is more breathable than cotton and 66% lighter. Heavy cotton and itchy wool suits don't even compare to the comfort of the Maxim Air. Our fabric is naturally porous at a molecular level, which allows for free air flow making it 50% more breathable than cotton. Using a special weaving technique, the fabric itself contains micro-gaps creating an air permeability of 6000 units, resulting in a supreme breathability for the ultimate in comfort.  The Maxim Air is reversible with two stylish looks in one. Our 360˚ lapels and patented, futuristic magnetic enclosure helps transform one look to the other and takes you from the office to the club in seconds. We’ve even included an elegant monogram as a designer finishing touch on your look. Every detail of our blazer has been perfectly designed, even down to the lapels. Our patented 360-degree rotational lapels perfectly conceal the reversible nature of the garment. Because we use a special micro-coil single needle chain stitch, no one will know that it's secretly two blazers in one. The futuristic magnetic closure not only gives your blazer a clean, smooth line, it's also quick and easy to use and aids in the reversibility of your garment.   Our fabric is infused with pliable elastane providing an optimum three dimensional stretch and giving you the ultimate in freedom of flexibility. Maxim Air's Modal fibers are harmoniously blended with Microfiber to enhance wrinkle resistance. Perfect for commuters, travellers, or those who work hard and play hard, our wrinkle-resistant fabric makes sure you look clean and polished no matter what the day brings. We haven't compromised aesthetic for breathability. Our fabric is specially engineered and brushed to have the appearance of luxury wool, but with the breathability of a cotton shirt.  Check out how the liquid just runs down the material and cannot penetrate.Maxim Air is infused with advanced stain repellent nano technology.  By increasing the liquid contact angle of the garment to greater than 90 degrees, any liquid spilled on your blazer forms round droplets that stay “suspended” and roll off the garment instead of getting absorbed into the fabric, keeping you clean and dry. Because we know you need to stay odor-free all day, we've infused our fabric with antibacterial silver ions. The silver ions disrupt the cell division process of bacteria and destroy it, keeping your blazer smelling fresh.   Your style is uniquely your own and we let you customize your blazer with your own initials stitched in elegant Mulberry Silk to be picked in a survey after the campaign is over. Our uniquely blended fabric wicks moisture and sweat away from the body, keeping the wearer cool and dry while feeling soothing against the skin. Because we know that the modern man needs to look great and feel great, we've re-invented the blazer and designed a garment that looks good on most body types and includes modern features with classic elegance.  Our custom blended materials feel buttery and silky smooth on the skin for the ultimate in all-day comfort.   Carefully handpicked, elegant, exotic colors! After carefully and closely studying several high quality suit brands size charts, practically stitching the blazers and pants for 3 different sized male models in our video and extrapolating all this data - resulted in the above size chart.

Because it takes longer to tan the leather with natural tannins it has been replaced by chromium tanning at the turn of the century. We get our leather from a small valley in Tuscany, Italy, one of the handful of places in the world where this is still done. It's much more resilient that normal leather, it's all natural, eco friendly and really smells good too. It will come with a certificate of authenticity and a serial number. </p><p>   THE SMART BELT UNIVERSAL is made out of leather that is dyed structurally, inside, as opposed to painting the top layer.

My wife thinks this belt is brilliant but a bit manly (obviously lol)</p><p>Thank you again! It’s the last belt I’ll buy, except another from you when you do this again lol”</p><p>”Arrived in Melbourne, Australia. Looks great, easy to use once I realised that loosening works by first pulling to tighten and while doing that pushing the button is effortless since holding to tighten it releases the pressure on the button from the ratchet mechanism. ”</p><p>”the smart belt was fantastic good! very convenient. is there any chance i could buy another one? or u guys making 4.0 soon? ”</p><p>”Hi I received my belt and it's perfect !

All perfect. My husband and sons love them! ”</p><p>”Received my belts and buckles yesterday. Fantastic product. Would like to see more buckle designs in future. 4.0? How about a titanium buckle? Would solve the allergy issue perhaps. ”</p><p>”Thanks for sorting out the issue with my order - the buckle was missing from my package but after mentioning that on here you corrected the issue and got the buckle a few days a go. Belt is great and your communication and handling of issues was awesome! ”</p><p> SMART BELT 1.0 &amp; 2.0:</p><p>Kickstarter, Backer #10833,  comment:</p><p>“Got my belt and love it!

Everything about the belts are simply amazing. ????????”</p><p>Kickstarter, Backer #10475,  comment:</p><p>“The belt is tightened by pulling it through the buckle and the ratchet tightens in small steps. To release the belt, pull the end that pokes out of the buckle whilst pushing the buckle release knob and push the belt back through the buckle. Once you’ve done it a couple of times it becomes second nature. When you get the belt, the leather part is long enough to fit the widest waist (within reason). Wrap the belt around you and cut to length so what the middle of the ratchet on the front end of the belt meets the cut end of the belt. Best to cut longer and then fit the buckle. You can always trim a bit more so that it eventually it is cut to your size. There is a small cream leaflet that comes with the belt and buckle that shows all this. That’s how I did it, and it’s the most comfortable belt I have ever owned.”</p><p>Kickstarter, Backer #159634,  comment:</p><p>“I have just received my belts. Superior quality and excellent design.

With a track record spanning 6 years and 7 Campaigns with over 60 000 backers in crowdfunding overall, it's safe to say we have done this before.       This year, as before, we have improved  upon our innovative belt to make it even better. We've done it with your help and feedback and are grateful, sincerely and extremely grateful to the Kickstarter Community  for providing us with a home and a place of learning. This year, THE SMART BELT UNIVERSAL is renewed with wider textile straps for the many backers that specifically insisted that they must have wider and more casual looking straps on their Smart Belts. Well, here they are.                  We have unlocked a whole new level of comfort by replacing the 5 hole system with 32 adjustments. This system brings  a whole new dimension of adjustability. Not many people think about it or realize it but, our waist changes as we go about our business throughout the day. A classic belt does not adjust correctly because holes are too far apart.                Forget feeling tight or loose, you'll forget you have a belt on but your pants will stay exactly where they're supposed to.    The Leather we use is the most exclusive leather anywhere in the world. Vegetable Tanning is almost a lost art. Because it takes longer to tan the leather with natural tannins it has been replaced by chromium tanning at the turn of the century. We get our leather from a small valley in Tuscany, Italy, one of the handful of places in the world where this is still done. It's much more resilient that normal leather, it's all natural, eco friendly and really smells good too. It will come with a certificate of authenticity and a serial number.    THE SMART BELT UNIVERSAL is made out of leather that is dyed structurally, inside, as opposed to painting the top layer. By doing this, we made sure that scratches can be reabsorbed inside the leather itself, a kind of self healing.          Have you ever had a problem with a wrong size or buying a present for someone, ever been in between sizes? Not our Smart Belt Universal. You will get to make your own size, so no chance of getting it wrong.          Our Kevlar® Core built with Kevlar® fibres is our staple innovation. Belts wear out because the leather flexes longitudinally and loses structure. Our Kevlar® Core prevents that from happening by reinforcing the whole structure like nothing else. It makes the whole thing highly durable yet light and comfortable.  We are the only licensee authorized by DuPont to make belts using the Kevlar® brand.     DuPont™ and Kevlar® are trademarks or registered trademarks of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company used under license by Harmattan Design LLC  (Project Creators). THE CASUAL STRAPS These straps are Polyester and are wider than our leather straps. They are 40 mm wide (1.6"") and have a more casual look. These straps do not have a Kevlar Core as we do not think it to be necessary as these Polyester straps are strong enough without it.          THE LEATHER STRAPS         These straps are our regular Vegetable Tanned Italian Leather straps with a Kevlar Core. They are dyed through so the color will not fade and will last much much longer than anything else.  They will cover a max. waist size of 115 cm / 45"" (not pants size, actual measured waist size). For longer straps please get in touch with us by clicking on our name on the right and then ""Contact Me"". THE BUCKLES                   We've been spoiled by support and trust of so many backers, so, thank you very much.If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask in the comments or by direct message by clicking on our name, as creators, in the upper left corner of the page. REVIEWS OF SMART BELT CAMPAIGNSSOME OF OUR BACKERS THAT SENT VIDEOS:  COMMENTS FROM THE SMART BELT ULTIMATE & OTHER SMART BELT CAMPAIGNS:(WE COULD NOT POST THEM ALL HERE, THE SPACE IS AUTOMATICALLY LIMITED) Kickstarter Backers, Smart Belt Ultimate comments:“Just wanted to post a quick Thank You to the Harmattan team.

And I love the new minimal buckle, it's much more comfortable while sitting. Thanks! ””GuysThis belt is amazing! Truly! No more holes that get destroyed by normal use, making it so easy to change between trousers ! And the micro adjustment from the ratchet system is genius.My suggestions for mk4 are the following:-A wider belt and buckle for jeans.A complete woman’s range with colours and buckles tailored to the female of the species. My wife thinks this belt is brilliant but a bit manly (obviously lol)Thank you again! It’s the last belt I’ll buy, except another from you when you do this again lol””Arrived in Melbourne, Australia. Looks great, easy to use once I realised that loosening works by first pulling to tighten and while doing that pushing the button is effortless since holding to tighten it releases the pressure on the button from the ratchet mechanism. ””the smart belt was fantastic good! very convenient. is there any chance i could buy another one? or u guys making 4.0 soon? ””Hi I received my belt and it's perfect ! How can I purchase another one ? ””Best belt ever so far. Have 4 of them plus some more as gift. Can’t wait for more colors such as burgundy. Make sure the color stays on.

All perfect. My husband and sons love them! ””Received my belts and buckles yesterday. Fantastic product. Would like to see more buckle designs in future. 4.0? How about a titanium buckle?

Everything about the belts are simply amazing. ????????”Kickstarter, Backer #10475,  comment:“The belt is tightened by pulling it through the buckle and the ratchet tightens in small steps. To release the belt, pull the end that pokes out of the buckle whilst pushing the buckle release knob and push the belt back through the buckle. Once you’ve done it a couple of times it becomes second nature. When you get the belt, the leather part is long enough to fit the widest waist (within reason). Wrap the belt around you and cut to length so what the middle of the ratchet on the front end of the belt meets the cut end of the belt. Best to cut longer and then fit the buckle. You can always trim a bit more so that it eventually it is cut to your size. There is a small cream leaflet that comes with the belt and buckle that shows all this. That’s how I did it, and it’s the most comfortable belt I have ever owned.”Kickstarter, Backer #159634,  comment:“I have just received my belts. Superior quality and excellent design. I would definitely order again. Many thanks!”Kickstarter, Backer #10455,  Bricks comment:“I received my belt yesterday. What a great design.

It absorbs the impact and protects the four vital areas of the upper body: the neck, back, abdomen and thorax. Specially designed for bikes and electric bikes, the Cirrus jacket offers protection all year round for everyday travel, weekend trips and outdoor adventures.  Pre-order today and find out why CIRRUS is the only jacket you need to cycle in cities and the countryside with complete peace of mind.   More and more of us cycle in cities and on country roads on a daily basis, which is great news!  ? There were 12% more cyclists in France in 2020 and 67% more traffic on Paris’ cycle paths. Bike sales have gone through the roof in the US and Canada, with sales of classic bikes rising by 65% and electric bikes by 165% between 2019 and 2020!  And yet we all have to share the road with motorized vehicles that make us vulnerable:And we are exposed to numerous hazards that increase the risk of falls and accidents and therefore injury:And if we do have an accident, the only think that will protect us is the equipment we are wearing. Helmets are a key essential, but they’re not enough for more serious accidents:  We believe it is possible to reduce this vulnerability. That’s why we decided to create CIRRUS, the first airbag jacket for cyclists.   CIRRUS is a smart airbag jacket designed for everyday use on bikes and electric bikes. The airbag is released automatically in the event of an accident or fall, inflating in 0.08 seconds to provide maximum protection to the vital parts of the upper body.    Cirrus analyzes the cyclist’s movements in real time. The system captures and analyzes their position over 100 times a second—that’s every 0.01 seconds! If it detects a fall or accident, the airbag inflates within 0.08 seconds. So, in the event of a fall or accident, the airbag will be operational in under 0.09 seconds—literally in the blink of an eye!  That speed ensures the airbag is released and operational before your body comes into contact with any external elements such as the ground, an obstacle or a car, offering you immediate protection, no matter how fast the accident happens.  Bike accidents and falls can happen quickly and without warning, leaving cyclists no time to react. CIRRUS detects falls and accidents completely autonomously and automatically. 1/ The system senses the cyclist’s movementsAccidents and falls are detected thanks to 2 built-in movement sensors, one on the bike and the other on the jacket:  These two sensors communicate via a radio proprietary protocole. They uses accelerometers and gyroscopes to track 400 times per secondes the movements and position of the system. 2/ The system analyzes the cyclist’s movementsThe system uses a proprietary algorithm that identifies specific movements associated with cycling accidents and falls which took over two years to develop. Our design engineers studied hundreds of bicycle falls in simulations and crash tests and collected a vast amount of data.  Once complete, the entire system was trialled in crash-tests and real-life conditions by beta tester cyclists for several months.The system was then certified in Europe (CE PPI Category II) and in the United States (FCCC, UL and IEC 62368-1). 3/ A system that detects ALL cycling falls and accidentsThe algorithm identifies specific movements from the cyclist during all types of accidents and falls: . collision with a vehicle: whether from the front (car door or head-on collision), the side (failure to give way) and behind (sudden stop),. collision between the bike and an urban hazard causing the cyclist to fall,. loss of control of the bike (skids, uncontrolled braking, loss of balance, sun, etc.). From all directions, from the side, front or back. Whatever direction the bike falls in, whether in the same direction as the cyclist, in the opposite direction, with the cyclist still seated or if they become separated from the bike. Whether or not the cyclist is moving, at both high speeds and a complete standstill. Finally, because the algorithm was developed specifically to identify accidents and falls while on a bike, the airbag cannot be accidentally triggered by any other movement. It will not, for example, be triggered by movements of the body like bending over to pick up keys!  CIRRUS is designed to protect you from serious injuries that could put your life in danger and therefore offers maximum protection for the vital organs located in your chest:   To ensure maximum protection, the CIRRUS airbag offers a large volume: . 17 litres / 4,4 gallons for XS to L models. 28 litres / 6,5 gallons for XL to XXL modelsThis means the entire back is covered, from the back of the skull to the coccyx, and the entire chest area.  The elasticated side straps ensure comfort and security when the airbag is inflated, without compressing the thorax.  CIRRUS can be turned on and off in a single click:CIRRUS couldn’t be easier to use. Simply press the only button inside the jacket three times and a green light will go on. Zip the jacket up to chest height and you’re ready to go! To switch it off, simply press the same button three more times. CIRRUS goes into standby mode automatically: To conserve battery power, CIRRUS automatically goes into standby mode after 30 seconds of inactivity. It reactivates automatically at the slightest movement. CIRRUS communicates with you: . The light turns orange when only two hours of batter power remain.. If the system has not been properly reconnected after washing or if the cartridge has not been replaced after being triggered, the light will turn red and a beeping sound will indicate that the airbag is not operational.   The airbag for the CIRRUS jacket is reusable. If the airbag has been deployed, simply wait ten minutes for it to naturally deflate. Then replace the used gas cartridge with a new one. The gas cartridge is easy to reach via the side zip opening inside the jacket.CIRRUS was made to come with you day after day, during all your rides and to help you overcome any obstacle.   CIRRUS lasts approximately 25 hours between charges, the equivalent of one week’s use on average.The light turns orange when only two hours of batter power remain.  Then simply remove the sensor from the jacket via the inside side zip and recharge it using the charger provided. The battery will be fully charged in just three hours.    CIRRUS is equipped with reflective, stretchy Rainbow Impact® fabric: That technology-infused fabric features an iridescent coating of glass micro-beads that reflect light from sources up to 500 feet away (150 m). This fabric uses millions of glace beads 65 micron in diameter backed by a vaporized aluminium coating. The net effect of the beads is that regardless of where you are in relation to the light source, a number of glace spheres are pointed at it and will reflect its light.  When you wear this jacket, you will be visible at night to anyone with a source of light. Because it’s so stretchy, the airbag can deploy, and the fabric will shrink back to its original shape once it deflates.Rainbow Impact® fabric is iridescent, producing an array of shades from blue to violet that make every Cirrus jacket unique.  CIRRUS was designed to protect you even in bad weather, meaning you can still cycle in the depths of winter and heavy rain. . 10,000 mm Schmerber waterproof and windproof membrane CIRRUS is equipped with a micro-perforated membrane that creates a waterproof barrier to rain and wind. It offers optimum waterproofing of 10,000 mm Schmerber (ISO 811 standard). . Durable water-repellent treatmentThis water-resistant treatment creates a protective layer preventing water from penetrating fibres, causing it to slide off the surface of the fabric without being absorbed. It performs at level 4 out of 5 in the Spray Test (NF EN ISO 4920 standard). . Thermofused stitchingSeams can create breaks in the membrane’s waterproof barrier, that’s why all the seams in the CIRRUS jacket have been heat-sealed. This involves placing heat-activated waterproof tape over the seam, before heating it between two rollers. Once cooled, a solid bond forms between the tape and the seams, prevented water from entering. . Waterproof zippers   CIRRUS is designed for everyday cycling, especially the daily commute. That’s why it needed to be breathable and well-ventilated. . Breathable membrane:CIRRUS fabric allows water vapour to be evacuated while remaining waterproof, meaning you’ll never be left damp by transpiration while cycling. The micro-perforated membrane allows water to pass through at a moisture vapour transmission rate (MVTR) of 5,000 g/m²/day. . Three venting zips:Depending on the size and number of hills on your route, these can help increase the ability to evacuate the moisture released by the body.CIRRUS is equipped with four zip openings so you can choose your preferred level of ventilation. CIRRUS is so versatile it can be used both in the depths of winter and the hottest parts of autumn and spring.  CIRRUS offers comfort and protection in every situation you might face as a frequent cyclist: 1/ SMART POCKETSCarry all your essentials with you, keeping them within easy reach thanks to the 5 specialized pockets: .

You’ll never want to take them off! Use them on rainy days or take them to the snow. Vtex V20 with 20 advanced features & triple odor protection will keep your feet comfortable, fresh and protected no matter where you go, any time of the year!                             Do you remember puddle hopping in the rain - only to wear those cold, wet sneakers all day long in grade school? Now you can relive those childhood memories and get to your destination with your feet as dry as when you left your home. Our fabric is designed to block water while letting air still pass through, keeping you extra dry and comfortable.  

                                                                                  We added Silver coated fibers to the Vtex V20 inner layer. Silver is used by healthcare facilities and even NASA. Silver fiber keeps the area around your feet sterile, keeping the cause of bad odor away. Vtex Nanotech membrane uses advanced patented technology to prevent dampness and has been tested and proven to block 99.9% of the cause of the bad odor. We also added our new Bamboo insoles with cushiony memory foam. The bamboo sucks moisture and bad smell away while keeping you dry and fresh. The cushiony memory foam provides support and comfort. It's like having high-quality mattresses inside your shoes. To perfect the odor protection, we have integrated a  long-lasting deodorant technology to the Vtex V20 fabric.  Your Vtex V20 will keep your feet dry and fresh even without socks thanks to the replaceable bamboo insole covers. They release heat and absorb moisture, keeping you fresh.Simply change the bamboo insole covers to get that fresh feeling. Pretty neat! *IMPORTANT NOTEAll V20 perks come with Bamboo Insoles. The Bamboo Insole Covers are NOT included. You can get yours as an add-on once you start the purchase process.- Check the FAQ section to learn how to get add-ons. Vtex is ultra hygienic, ensuring optimal freshness and cleanliness. Vtex fabric uses a self sterilizing technology which is also used by NASA and medical facilities. We tested the efficiency of our technology and Vtex scored a grade of ‘surgical level’. There is no better way to protect your feet than with the Vtex V20. Ultra-BreathableVtex’s advanced nanotech efficiently blocks outside elements from infiltrating your shoes while still being ultra-breathable. The breathability allows air and humidity to get out of your shoes to prevent dampness and heat and provide maximal comfort.Moisture-WickingVtex shoes are made of moisture-wicking materials ensuring that humidity will always find its way away from your feet. Say goodbye to damp, humid shoes that make you feel uncomfortable, and enjoy feeling dry and fresh with Vtex. The new Vtex V20 are cold-resistant for up to - 20 degrees. Don’t worry about cold rain, arctic winds, or even snow, our patented nanotech will stop the cold from infiltrating your shoes. Vtex keeps you at a perfectly comfortable temperature at all times. * The Vtex V20 triple odor protection effect can vary from one person to another.                                                    

 
* Price does not include possible tax/duty/service feeThe sweat and humidity inside your shoes act as a nursery for odor-causing bacteria, helping them grow bigger and stronger colonies. That’s not all; nasty fungus also like to join the party! That’s why you need silver fiber; none of these can survive, grow, and reproduce on Silver. Silver ions attract these pathogens and shatter their DNA, killing them before they get a chance to reproduce. NASA, Olympic athletes, and most military forces are using silver fiber to protect themselves against harmful odor-causing bacteria. Learn more in these scientific studies: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC22...https://www.silversafeproducts.com/# We lined the inner layer of Vtex using SILVERPLUS; the advanced silver fiber technology from the world leaders in the field, Rudolf Group. Their advanced process transforms pure silver into a silver compound that releases a perfect amount of silver ions when moisture is detected. We then use the silver compound to coat the fibers of the shoes. This technology has been proven to stop odor-causing bacteria.  See how our backer, Sylvain Caron, enjoyed his Vtex 12 features shoes that include waterproof, sand-proof, and cold-resistant, and others in his outdoor activities. Extra: He also tried out his new V-Tex shoes in the sand and in the snow. Check it out.

SELTEN is the German word for “rare”—due to our utmost respect for German watchmaking.
 
We are a contemporary microbrand watch company that opens to different ideas, creative thinking, unique materials, and an overall fresh approach to making timepieces. These watches will capture your attention immediately and refuse to let it go.
 
SERIES 00.00A defining feature of SELTEN watches is the use of intriguing materials that offer unique finishes. Whether Meteorite or Aventurine, the theme that binds these materials together is that the final executions of the same raw material are never exactly the same. Therefore, every SELTEN watch offers its own distinct design touches and no two watches are identical.  SERIES 01.13  The main difference between SERIES 00 & SERIES 01 is the Day And Night Indicator Living up to our motto, “A Rare Kind, Not a Stereotype”, each watch that bears the SELTEN name is fundamentally unique.  We source them directly from Meteorite Hunter. Period.  The amazing thing about automatic watches is that they do not require a battery inside the watch in order to work.Instead of using a battery, our watches have a weighted rotor on the back of the movement that will rotate whenever you’re wearing or shaking the watch.  What this means is that whenever you’re moving about, you’re generating energy to power your watch – how cool is that?  We offer 4 colors for our meteorite dials.The pattern of the meteorite dial is first brought out by etching it in the acid bath, and we rinse it with alcohol to remove any water residue on it, and in this stage, the dial is in Natural color.For the Natural color dial, it will be coated with a transparent protective layer to isolate it from moisture. While the Anthracite, Black, and Midnight Blue colors are achieved by ion-plating which is the same method done by the other microbrand watches. In the watch world, a lot of intriguing substances are used for dial making.Aventurine is a part of the quartz family. It is translucent in appearance but is most known for its many mineral inclusions that give the material a shimmering effect.The Aventurine we use here is the Dark Blue Aventurine which is a rather uncommon color among its type.Typically, when you search for an Aventurine watch, you'd probably see that the Aventurine is in a rather Blue-ish color. However, we prefer a more subtle one, so we spent a lot of time searching for a supplier who does this Dark Blue Aventurine.Aventurine on a dial does a wonderful imitation of a starry sky. The flashes of light bouncing off spangles that appear to be floating inside the dial.Combining with our watches, like the night sky, Dark Blue Aventurine bears a subtle twinkling, attracting us to seek poetic ways to read the time.There is the option of the traditional Pontife style hands, characterised by large circular accents, in heated blue steel.An increasing number of watch brands choose to chemically treat watch hands to achieve a blue colour. The outcome is a homogeneous shade of blue which is devoid of any personality. In line with our “A Rare Kind, Not a Stereotype” philosophy, we thermally blue watch hands by hand, carefully subjecting the steel to high temperatures to achieve the most exquisite blue tone. Thermal bluing requires a deft hand and is time-consuming, but the result is that each watch hand is bestowed with its own unique shade, featuring a fusion of blue and purple hues. We offer two types of colorway for our heated blue steel hands.The option is based on its legibility. Type I is with the Blue Hour & Min Hand and Silver Second Hand.Type II is with the Silver Hour & Min Hand and Blue Second Hand.  Lance Hands is available for all dial options.Alternatively, there is the choice of the sleek Lance style hands coated with Swiss Super-Luminova for optimal legibility in low light.Our Lance Hands option has equipped with Swiss Super-LumiNova BGW9 on it and also we’ve added Super-LumiNova C3 in our black pigment to make the index glow.*Lume only applies for Lance HandsSERIES 00 utilise two meteorite slices on the Day & Night Indicator.A pair of meteorite slices are used on the SERIES 00 watches for the Day & Night (also known as A.M./P.M. display) indicator.They are placed inside the subsidiary dial at 6 o’clock where a bright-coloured piece of meteorite represents day and a darker-coloured piece of meteorite represents night. Due to the nature of the Widmanstätten pattern, no meteorites are the same. Therefore each subsidiary dial of a SERIES 00 watch will stand out by having different meteorite finishes. SERIES 00 & SERIES 01 both come with custom rotors.SERIES 00SERIES 01 Every movement sourced for SELTEN watches is fitted with a custom rotor, which is visible through the watches’ exhibition casebacks. The design of our custom rotor is based on the Triple Horn of Odin emblem from Norse mythology.  
 Double FinishIn all its versions, SERIES 00 & SERIES 01 radiates its status as an art.  Our watch is done with contrasting finishes to give the watch an interesting and sophisticated look and create extra depth to the look of the watch from many angles.
 
 Our buckle also features a double finish, a polished finish on the top, and a brushed finish on the side.
Applied baton indices with a polished finish on topApplied logo plate with a circular brushed finish The serial number for each watch will be randomly distributed to backers.If you wish to reserve your preferred number,  you can select the customised serial number service in the add-on section. The first 1000 pieces of each SERIES will be individually numbered.Sapphire crystal rates a full 9 on the Mohs scale. The Mohs scale is used to measure the relative mineral hardness of materials, with diamond being a 10 on the Mohs scale as one of the hardest materials. This is why we chose this for both SERIES 00 & SERIES 01. Our sapphire crystal has also applied 5 layers of Anti-Reflective Coating on the underside to improve legibility.Double lug holes have been retained to accommodate both straight and curved straps.
 
We are proud to announce our collaboration with HAS NO BOUNDS, a newly established brand, who focuses on premium handcrafted leather goods. They will be crafting the leather straps for SELTEN watches!
Apparently, HAS NO BOUNDS shares the same vision with us of creating unique products with unparalleled value for money.
Every watch will come with a leather strap as the default option.We’ve specially chosen these luxury Italian leather for our watches.  Meteorite dial to pair with Museum Calf leather from Ilcea Tannery  
Museum Calf is made famous by John Lobb Pairs for their luxury leather shoes. Each leather hide is hand-dyed featuring a glossy sheen with a unique marble-like effect.   Aventurine dial to pair with Maine Liscio leather from Tempesti Tannery 
Maine Liscio is a pure vegetable tanned leather in aniline-dyed, featuring a natural surface with a pleasant hand touch. Over wear, it will become silky smooth and age beautifully.Our straps come with the Quick Release Spring Bar which allows you to switch straps easily.
 Our butterfly deployant clasp bracelet is made of 316L Stainless Steel.Our bracelets are with solid end links that fit the wrist better and are more comfortable than hollow end links. It comes with screw-in links which makes it the simplest bracelet to resize. It’s also very reliable. The butterfly deployant clasp is completely invisible when you’re wearing the watch. It makes the band look seamless like the watch is magically staying buckled without the clasp. It’s perhaps the most elegant type of watch clasp that you will encounter. The bracelet is tapered to 16mm.It is for those looking for a secure and inconspicuous type of clasp – it closes on the wrist, so the mechanism will not be seen on the outer strap. It also equips with Quick Release Mechanism to allow you to change it to leather strap in a flash.We also offer an extra 1.25x link for the micro adjustment needs.
 
 
 
 
 Our first collection offers two different models, the SERIES 00 and the SERIES 01, each with its own signature dial layout.  SERIES 00 includes a subsidiary dial at 6 o’clock, complete with a pair of meteorite discs to indicate day and night.  On the other hand, the absence of the subdial on SERIES 01 allows the striking Meteorite/Aventurine Dial to take center stage.

My parents had always dreamed of owning their own watch brand. After working for JP Morgan since I graduated, I decided to continue the family legacy and build something exceptional. Thus, SELTEN was born. If you’re new to the name, get ready for timepieces that are truly unique. They’re built to the highest standards and feature designs that captivate the imagination and maintain spectacular levels of accuracy. While traditional watch brands are often confined to one location and thus rooted in one particular way of thinking, as a modern watch brand, we have the privilege of looking to all corners of the globe for inspiration.  The quality, craftsmanship, and beauty of German watches, as well as the resilience of the German watchmaking industry, serve as inspiration to SELTEN and me.

All our watches come with a Certificate of Authenticity and a one-year international warranty against manufacturing or movement defects.  SERIES 00.00

 We have worked very hard over the past 4 years to reach this stage. We don't have big money to spend on PR/Marketing, as a result, we could keep our cost even lower to offer you such affordable prices for our watches.We hope that you could share our project with the world, letting more people know about us!",108.0,0,"1 Campaign

As with any challenge there are risks involved. Even with manufacturing prices agreed upon, prices of raw materials can fluctuate or new trade tariffs can be introduced. As an entrepreneur I am used to carrying those risks, so please do not worry about this. Another type of risk involves potential delays. If the production schedule changes due to unforeseen circumstances, delays can occur. Logistical hiccups are another source of potential delays. From my past projects I have also learned to not skip steps like quality control to rush things. In my experience these types of delays are not uncommon, so I have already incorporated some extra time in the schedule. Together we will have to accept the risk of any further delays. When pursuing a new design, a manufacturer's technical capabilities can be pushed to the limit. This is surely the case here. But after having seen dozens of samples, I have confidence that the manufacturer of the tungsten carbide is able to repeat the same quality that you can see in the images. Something to be aware of as a backer is that this is a tool, made by a tool manufacturer in a very limited production run. The price is about what you would expect to pay for a tool like this. It should tell you that it is not a custom handmade knife and also not a piece of jewelry, so please do not expect that level of finesse at this cost. I will try my very best to get the manufacturers to deliver the best quality possible, but there is always the risk of minor cosmetic flaws inherent to the production process chosen. To give a specific example: From the tool manufacturers perspective, the black nitride coating is a functional coating, but from our perspective it is an aestetic choice. A minor flaw in the coating will have a different meaning from those two different perspectives. I consider it my job to bring those two perspectives closer to each other, without losing track of cost. (anything can be executed to perfection if your pockets are deep enough). For the production of the stands I am relying on a manufacturer I have worked with for years. They have always delivered excellent quality. In addition, aluminum processing is relatively simple compared to tungsten carbide processing. For that reason I am not expecting too many issues here. For the silicone, small pouch and cords I am again relying on manufacturers that I have already worked with for years, so no problems expected there either. I chose a company with a stellar reputation to make the hard cases. They build cases for many reputable brands like Bose and Beats. Finally there is always a risk of a manufacturer going out of business. I have never experienced that, but it would involve trying to recoup funds and finding a new manufacturer causing major delays. I chose to work with large established manufacturers, reducing the risk of them bailing on you. A separate potential issue that anyone outside of the U.S. should be aware of is that this is a knife, albeit a small one with a short edge. In some countries carrying a knife, no matter how small, is prohibited. Be aware of your local laws. Related to this is the shipping of the Cizor outside of the US. For customs it will be marked as the glass cutting tool that it is. The declared value will most likely be above the duty threshold. This means that you will have to pay some duties when you receive your items. Here in the US we are used to paying our sales taxes separately, but for many people outside the US this can come as a surprise. In order to lessen the burden on you, I will minimize the declared value on the package within legal limits, but it will most likely still be above the threshold. I hope to hereby have given you full transparency about the risks involved. It is not the same as buying a product off the (virtual) shelf. But let's not forget the reason why all of us are involved in crowdfunding. It is exciting to be involved in creating a new product, especially when you share that experience with many likeminded people.

For example, the aluminum and steel parts of your Apple products are most likely cut with tungsten carbide tools.Larger and sharper than its predecessors Break Glass in EmergenciesCar windows are notoriously hard to break, and for good reason.  But tempered glass does not stand a chance against the conical back tip of the solid tungsten carbide Cizor. Obviously, this particular use of the Cizor is intended for emergency situations only.  Heavy StoneTungsten translates to “heavy stone” in Swedish. Its density is close to that of gold. And like gold, tungsten carbide has found its way into some amazing jewelry. Although I would not categorize the Cizor knives as jewelry, I have spent quite some time on the appearance. Natural or BlackIn addition to the grey luster of raw tungsten carbide, both sizes of the Cizor are available in a black finish as well. Through a vapor depositing technique, a thin layer of deep black aluminum titanium nitride is applied before the final bevel is cut. This creates a nice contrast between the polished edge and the black shaft. In this case the finish is just for looks, but in the machining industry this particular coating is known for its extreme resistance to heat and friction. In the survey you will be able to pick and choose the colors of your knife, stand, and cap. Anodized Aluminum Stands tip up or tip down, the stand can be used both waysBoth the small and the large Cizor are available with a 6061 aluminum desk stand, anodized in red, black, blue or natural. The design of the stand is very utilitarian; just a straight forward chunk of machined metal, yet still mimicking the exact angles of the conical design of the back of the Cizor knife itself.The tip of the Cizor is perfect for penetrating and cutting a wide variety of packaging materials. The polished cutting edge is ruthlessly sharp and will stay that way unless you absolutely abuse the blade. It would be a misconception to compare this cutting edge to an average steel blade, it is a completely different animal. The scientific name of tungsten is wolfram, and the tip of the knife looks and functions a bit like a canine incisor. It did not take long to arrive at Cizor as a fitting name.The complete Small Cizor KitI also designed a custom zippered hard case for each knife and its accessories. The exterior is made from robust 1680D ballistic cordura nylon. A removable EVA foam insert keeps the knife securely in place during transport. The Small Cizor kit and the Large Cizor kitExceptionally HardDelving a little deeper into the details of the design, you may wonder how such a hard material can be manipulated into the shape I designed. The basic shape of the Cizor knives is formed out of a powdered state of the material, often consisting of pulverized recycled carbide tools. The finer details of the design are cut by diamond encrusted wheels. Diamond is one of the few materials in existence harder than tungsten carbide, and thus able to cut it.DimensionsTungsten carbide is much harder than steel, but therefore also less flexible. For that reason the tip design of the Cizor has seen many iterations to optimize its strength.  A hardened steel blade might lose its tip when accidentally dropped. This would also be the case when you drop the Cizor, so be careful.The conical backExtra Safety FeatureBecause the back of the portable Cizor was designed to break glass, a tough 6061 aluminum barrier prevents the sharp tip of the blade from being forced into the cap during an impact. This safety feature was designed to prevent damage to the cap (or worse). During my tests of breaking glass, I found the barrier to be overkill, but nonetheless comforting to have. The glass hardly provides any resistance and falls away like sugar. The silicone cap bisected to show the aluminum impact barrierIf you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to use the Cizor in this way, I do want to stress that you protect your and any bystanders' eyes and limbs from the shattering glass. In addition you should be aware of your local laws regarding damaging other people’s property in emergency situations. (California recently passed a law that allows you to break a car window to rescue an animal in distress.) A collage of blue and natural colored metalThe Cizor is a very unique every day cutting tool, and it has been a challenge to find the right manufacturer to help me realize this long standing design idea. There are very few other EDC tungsten carbide knives available in the world, and the prices are often quite high. This is due to the difficulty that manufacturers encounter when trying to shape this material. For the same reason, a simple tungsten carbide wedding ring can be a serious investment too. I am glad to be able to keep the cost of the Cizor very reasonable, considering these factors.Thank you for reading all the way to the end, and I hope to have sparked your interest in this unique project. If you have any questions, please feel free to message me or post them publicly in the comment section, which I will be monitoring.Cheers,Sander Pledge LevelsBelow you will find a schematic summary of what is included in each pledge level. I am showing only a sampling of available color combinations. The NATURAL COLOR CIZOR package is limited to a single color. Your will make your final color selection in the survey which will be issued after the campaign closes. In the survey you will also be able to add extra caps, cords, stands and possibly other accessories.If you would like to pledge for multiple rewards, you can adjust your pledge amount to reflect the additional cost. In the survey you will be able to allocate those extra funds to whatever extra rewards you would like to purchase. NATURAL SMALL CIZOR: fixed color scheme SMALL CIZOR: Pick any color cap, cord and small Cizor. SMALL CIZOR KIT: Pick any color cap, cord, small stand and small Cizor. LARGE CIZOR KIT: Pick any color large stand and Cizor. COMBO: LARGE KIT + SMALL KIT: Pick any color small stand, large stand, caps, small Cizor and large Cizor. Risks and challengesAlthough I have done it several times now, creating a new product from scratch is always challenging. As with any challenge there are risks involved. Even with manufacturing prices agreed upon, prices of raw materials can fluctuate or new trade tariffs can be introduced. As an entrepreneur I am used to carrying those risks, so please do not worry about this. Another type of risk involves potential delays. If the production schedule changes due to unforeseen circumstances, delays can occur. Logistical hiccups are another source of potential delays. From my past projects I have also learned to not skip steps like quality control to rush things. In my experience these types of delays are not uncommon, so I have already incorporated some extra time in the schedule. Together we will have to accept the risk of any further delays. When pursuing a new design, a manufacturer's technical capabilities can be pushed to the limit. This is surely the case here. But after having seen dozens of samples, I have confidence that the manufacturer of the tungsten carbide is able to repeat the same quality that you can see in the images. Something to be aware of as a backer is that this is a tool, made by a tool manufacturer in a very limited production run. The price is about what you would expect to pay for a tool like this. It should tell you that it is not a custom handmade knife and also not a piece of jewelry, so please do not expect that level of finesse at this cost. I will try my very best to get the manufacturers to deliver the best quality possible, but there is always the risk of minor cosmetic flaws inherent to the production process chosen. To give a specific example: From the tool manufacturers perspective, the black nitride coating is a functional coating, but from our perspective it is an aestetic choice. A minor flaw in the coating will have a different meaning from those two different perspectives. I consider it my job to bring those two perspectives closer to each other, without losing track of cost. (anything can be executed to perfection if your pockets are deep enough). For the production of the stands I am relying on a manufacturer I have worked with for years. They have always delivered excellent quality. In addition, aluminum processing is relatively simple compared to tungsten carbide processing. For that reason I am not expecting too many issues here. For the silicone, small pouch and cords I am again relying on manufacturers that I have already worked with for years, so no problems expected there either. I chose a company with a stellar reputation to make the hard cases. They build cases for many reputable brands like Bose and Beats. Finally there is always a risk of a manufacturer going out of business. I have never experienced that, but it would involve trying to recoup funds and finding a new manufacturer causing major delays. I chose to work with large established manufacturers, reducing the risk of them bailing on you. A separate potential issue that anyone outside of the U.S. should be aware of is that this is a knife, albeit a small one with a short edge. In some countries carrying a knife, no matter how small, is prohibited. Be aware of your local laws. Related to this is the shipping of the Cizor outside of the US. For customs it will be marked as the glass cutting tool that it is. The declared value will most likely be above the duty threshold. This means that you will have to pay some duties when you receive your items. Here in the US we are used to paying our sales taxes separately, but for many people outside the US this can come as a surprise. In order to lessen the burden on you, I will minimize the declared value on the package within legal limits, but it will most likely still be above the threshold. I hope to hereby have given you full transparency about the risks involved. It is not the same as buying a product off the (virtual) shelf. But let's not forget the reason why all of us are involved in crowdfunding. It is exciting to be involved in creating a new product, especially when you share that experience with many likeminded people. S",34.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>The idea of a powered mask was brought to us by our backer community during the original purME campaign. Back then some of our backers suggested adding a fan to increase the airflow. We embraced this idea but after extensive evaluation had to decide against it as our technology was still immature.</p>
<p>The breakthrough happened when we came across a prototype mini air purifier: the device was not only small and light enough to be pocketed, but also very quiet and powerful enough to purify the surrounding air. We quickly acquired the technology and the first purME Air was born.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615925340/yvu2djtlawf4sv5b545n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our design is complete and prototypes have undergone trials. Once the funding goal is reached, we will purchase raw materials and prepare assembly lines to start the production on time.</p>
<p>Even though purME Air is completely different from our original purME mask, we are going to use our previous manufacturing and delivery experience to ensure the highest quality and smooth production. Some materials are already certified for safety and durability. Also, we have contacted SGS and applied for safety and quality testing.</p>

</div></div>","The original purME mask was a great success. So we took into account all the feedback from our backer community, and built an improved second product — purME Air, the wearable air purifier!    Breathe Easier & Safer With purME Air, breathing through a mask is easy!Featuring twin innovative turbines, the mask constantly supplies you with filtered air. Go running, cycling, work out in a gym or just walk in the street wearing your fresh air!What’s more, you can always adjust the airflow to your needs with the 3 power levels: You decide how much pure air is enough for you.    Ultralight Weighing at just 80g, purME Air is one of the lightest powered twin-turbine masks. Go hiking, cycle to work, exercise at the gym or just take to the streets with maximum protection and almost no-mask feel!  REWARDS   ADD-ONS     How It Works           1. Choose one of the 3 power levels to supply sufficient filtered air to you depending on your activity, both indoors or in crowded places.2. A pair of identical, silent microturbines will draw exactly the same amount of air in and out of your mask, continuously providing you fresh air.3. Breathe in, breathe out! You’re ready to face the world. DEMO VIDEO Working Prototype Demo One-way Airflow & Constant Pressure Demo
 



 
 
Media About Us


 
 
Ergonomic Design
 

 
Perfect Fit
 

The silicone facepiece of purME Air that contacts your face is designed to deliver unrivaled comfort while keeping you safe.
Made of firm yet supple LFGB food grade silicone—free of organic vapor, heavy metals, and harmful residues—the silicone face mask not only ensures a perfect airtight fit to minimize air leakage but also seals tightly against your nose while you’re on the move.
 
 
Super Comfortable Feel
 

 
We’ve created purME Air with your comfort in mind. 
Made of firm yet supple LFGB food grade silicone—free of organic vapor, heavy metals, and harmful residues—the silicone face mask  will never cause any allergic reactions nor leave marks on it, even after hours of use.
With its folded-over seamless ergonomic design, the flexible silicone edge of the mask will sit comfortably on your face, and never leave marks on it, even after hours of use.
 
 
Full-Day Protection
 

purME Air is powered by a rechargeable battery stored inside. It offers 6-8 hours of operation, which is more than enough to protect you for the whole day. 
Need longer protection? No probs! Even if your mask’s battery is low, you can still wear it as the filters will continue to protect you. To bring back the full protection powers of purME Air, you’ll need only 2 hours and any USB cable to recharge it. 
 

 

Most people now breathe air containing high levels of pollution. Wearing a mask can help you filter the air from air pollutants, pollen, tobacco, wildfire smoke, and dust, which are mostly within the PM2.5 range.
 
Two-Sizes Fit All
 

purME Air is now available in 2 sizes—both Standard and Large!
Considering the feedback from our backers, we have decided to also add a Large size silicone facepiece.
It’s approximately 15% larger and is recommended for backers with larger face or taller nose
 
You will be able to select your size in the shipping survey, which we’ll send to you after the campaign ends. Note that the sizes come at no extra cost!

Technical Specifications
 

 

 

 

 
 
Lab Certified
 
All components of purME Air have been tested by independent labs to be safe for your wear.

Electronic Device: purME Air has been certified by SGS to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and regulations, and is safe for wearing.
Silicone Facepiece: The silicone part of purME Air that contacts your skin is made with food grade silicone and certified by SGS to LFGB standard. The design ensures you feel comfortable even when you wear it for hours.
And on top of that, purME Air fulfills most common regulations by health and safety authorities.
 
 
Stretch Goals
 
 

 
Our First Generation Was a Big Hit!

 
 
Production Stage
 

The idea of a powered mask was brought to us by our backer community during the original purME campaign. Back then some of our backers suggested adding a fan to increase the airflow. We embraced this idea but after extensive evaluation had to decide against it as our technology was still immature.
The breakthrough happened when we came across a prototype mini air purifier: the device was not only small and light enough to be pocketed, but also very quiet and powerful enough to purify the surrounding air. We quickly acquired the technology and the first purME Air was born.

Our design is complete and prototypes have undergone trials. Once the funding goal is reached, we will purchase raw materials and prepare assembly lines to start the production on time.
Even though purME Air is completely different from our original purME mask, we are going to use our previous manufacturing and delivery experience to ensure the highest quality and smooth production. Some materials are already certified for safety and durability. Also, we have contacted SGS and applied for safety and quality testing.

Choosing between design and comfort has never been an option for us. Lance combines its ergonomic designs with latest generation materials.  We’ve created timeless, light designs, suitable for wearing every day, all day long without feeling any discomfort: no margins, no harmful blue light, no eye-strain. Lance’s belief is that glasses are an extension of your body, not a bothering issue that needs to be hidden.  Flexible - Smart Metal - Say goodbye to easily breakable, heavy, uncomfortable frames.     An inventive approach is essential for the identity of the Lance brand.  We always try to search beyond the traditional limits of the eyewear industry, looking for new and relevant technologies in different fields and incorporating them into our system.    The Lance Air frames offer unparalleled comfort. Your long moments in front of the screen are now ideally taken care of. That’s not all, though! Our designs will look remarkable on your face, as invisible as you wish them to be, depending on your lens and frame colour preferences.      All of our frames’ arms are made of flexible beta-titanium. Two of our designs, Monceau & Nouvel, are entirely made of beta-titanium, ensuring total flexibility, even for the bridge.    Our team, along with the best opticians, have selected and implemented the finest lens features for your eyes.  Using advanced optical software and industry-leading machinery, Lance can handle the most complicated corrections with an extraordinary level of accuracy and optical clarity, including digital free-form lenses.      You don’t have to pay excessive amounts of money for your prescription. After the completion of the campaign, through our Survey, you’ll be able to fill in your prescription and choose your desired lenses, either Sharp or Fade. Our prescriptions cover values from 0 to +/-8 as well as progressive lenses.   The nanotechnology coatings are acting as a shield against blue light coming from your daily exposure to screens. The main source of HEV light in our lives is the harmful blue-violet light emitted by our digital screens. From TVs to tablets, computers to phones, we’re constantly exposing ourselves to the unnatural blue light. Having Sharp Lenses on your Lance Glasses will limit the amount of blue light that enters your eyes, making your screen time more pleasant.   The nanotechnology coatings are acting as a shield against blue light coming from your daily exposure to screens.

Check out our Instagram and try your favourite frames through our Virtual Try Mirror. You’ll definitely find the one that suits you best. If you’re still not confident enough, we’re constantly posting new Lance Air material on our Insta, so follow us for more fresh news!       The story of our designs started in Morez (Jura Valley) considered the Silicon Valley of glasses - the perfect place to create lasting eyeglasses and provide a first-hand experience to our clients. Later, Lance moved to Lille, France as part of the Euratechnologies Startups Incubator.    Lance Glasses started as a small crowdfunding project that soon took off and grew bigger and bigger. This could have never been possible without the support of our amazing community of 15 000 backers & growing from over 110 different countries. The amazing people who back us, along with their constructive opinions and feedback, constantly help us to improve our products and services    Each pair is made of first-rate materials. We believe that quality isn’t optional or just too expensive. The high-quality metal and polycarbonate lenses make Lance Air frames special and desirable. Wearing them will make you feel comfortable and offer your eyes the much needed focus for a productive day.  Our unique designs are specially created for you, based on a thorough research about face anatomy and current trends, so that you can feel and look perfect everyday, all day long.  Gold Glossy - Nouvel Silver Glossy, Silver Matte, Gold Glossy, Gold Matte Gold Matte - Nouvel The Environmental ImpactLance is a new age company that aims to do things the right way and create a business model based on a circular economy, both for our products and for the reusable packaging. At Lance, you buy a personalized product, made especially for you. Therefore, our lenses are produced on request. No dead stocks, no recycled waste from lens cutting. At the same time, our company works with small batches for frames, buying only the necessary raw material that will be transformed, upon request, into the finished product. Unlike in our previous campaigns, this time we decided to only use metal, leading to the reduction of a massive, up to 80% acetate waste we previously faced. To reduce the impact of transport with CO2 emissions, we centralize and realize everything in our laboratory, unlike traditional opticians.Here you can see the Lance Air prototyping in various stages of the project, as well as various metal textures and colours. Quality, convenience and design: a unique experience for all eyeglasses wearers.  Directly To You!All our efforts are channelled into creating luxury glasses that are affordable for everyone, combined with transparency and openness towards clients!  In order to do so, we’ve implemented an innovative business model, using top materials, directly from the factory. By removing the intermediaries, we are able to offer high-end products three times cheaper than the store pricing and suppress all the disproportionate margins that wholesalers and resellers usually take. We enjoy personally supervising each and every step of the production chain, from mood boards until the end product. Moreover, all of our frames are designed from scratch by our design team in France.  Our FactoriesWe only work with factories that share our values ​​of quality and integrity. We use the finest materials from leading suppliers in the industry. We consider that it is important to manufacture our glasses ethically and, at the same time, to offer a fair price, without sacrificing quality. Our CraftWhen creative concepts meet technical expertise & specialized craftsmanship combine with advanced technologies, the Lance Glasses Air frames are born. Our passionate designers invested many hours of workmanship in every single piece, meticulously made using only the finest components, materials, lenses and assembled by the Lance skilled artisans.  These are not the final lenses shades, but we added them to show you the variety of lenses colours you’ll be able to choose from - a more accurate selection will be provided upon purchase.        Lance Air - Black Matte / Beta Titanium Lance Air - Shiny Gold / Beta Titanium Lance Air - Matte Silver / Beta Titanium Lance Air - Matte Gold / Beta Titanium Lance Air - Shiny Silver / Beta Titanium  How do I configure my glasses?The following four weeks after the campaign’s termination, each of our backers will receive our Survey.

The technology is voice-activated, features camera, dual speakers, and a head-up display (HUD). Imagine the possibilities of being able to take pictures, record videos, make phone calls, or even watch videos, without having to pull out your phone. All components are embedded discreetly inside the frame, people around you won't be able to tell any technology is present. Norm Glasses can be hung on your shirt or blouse when not in use, just like normal sunglasses. The sleek design also folds up into a standard eyeglass case. </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/AwkxzaO6kK4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><div data-id=""25914513""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1566933871/nnnmi4lftz73uawqkcyi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

This direction changed a little in early 2015, when we heard that Google Glass Explorer edition stopped. We were tempted to see if we can add head-up display to our audio sunglasses, so that the potential customer population is much larger, and earnings can be used to subside the cost for blind edition. Another thought was, if we could put the heads-up display inside the glasses instead of protruding outside as on Google Glass, we would get a better looking smart glass and it may help to make it prevail.</p><p>After about one and a half years of R&amp;D, we got enough confidence on its feasibility.

The technology is voice-activated, features camera, dual speakers, and a head-up display (HUD). Imagine the possibilities of being able to take pictures, record videos, make phone calls, or even watch videos, without having to pull out your phone. All components are embedded discreetly inside the frame, people around you won't be able to tell any technology is present. Norm Glasses can be hung on your shirt or blouse when not in use, just like normal sunglasses. The sleek design also folds up into a standard eyeglass case.

 Our headquarters are located in South Florida, with remote team members in India and China.  We come from diverse industries with strong backgrounds in information technologies. We have a balanced blend of hardware and software engineers, some with as many as 20+ years in the industry.  We also have business and development seasoned professionals that serve in various capacities within our organization, including international manufacturing, governance, quality assurance.  Back in 2014, we were trying to produce audio sunglasses for blind people to interact with web pages etc using voice. This direction changed a little in early 2015, when we heard that Google Glass Explorer edition stopped. We were tempted to see if we can add head-up display to our audio sunglasses, so that the potential customer population is much larger, and earnings can be used to subside the cost for blind edition. Another thought was, if we could put the heads-up display inside the glasses instead of protruding outside as on Google Glass, we would get a better looking smart glass and it may help to make it prevail.After about one and a half years of R&D, we got enough confidence on its feasibility. Shortly after, Human Capable Inc was formed in Dec 2016.Since then, we've gone through hundreds of iterations on optical design and mechanical design. Following picture shows some of the frames that we had worked on. These are not all of them, we didn't keep them in the early days. There are no duplicates in the picture, each one is different from others, it may be created due to some changes on optical side, or some changes on the electronic side, or combination of both. On electronic side, we modulized the boards based on functionality so that we can change part of the hardware without impacting other parts of the system; even so, we had gone through over 20 iterations; the highly modulized mainboard of the mini-computer went through 5 iterations.

The combination boasts a real theatrical immersive experience with fantastic video and audio quality, making the device a true mobile cinema. It invigorates your movie, TV, or gaming experience, and escalates your daily entertainment to a new level.  Cinera Edge is using the latest technology -- micro OLED. With micro OLED, we managed to dramatically reduce the form factor while packing the same amount of pixels as in Cinera v1. Cinera Edge unlocks over the predecessor multiple significant advancements: integrated headphones, true mobility, and long-session comfortableness, etc.   Dual 2560x1440​Each of the two Cinera Edge’s screens delivers the astonishing 2560x1440 pixels, which is significantly higher than most other products in the market. Higher-resolution brings a sharper image with more details.   DCI-P3Its screen is using the same DCI-P3 color standard that is widely adopted by the projection systems used in movie theaters. DCI-P3 color space has a much more full gamut of color than the conventional sRGB so that Cinera Edge can reproduce more colors with more accuracy. Think about an Apple Pro Display (Cinera Edge) vs. a regular monitor in your office (Others). 3515 PPI Each screen packs 3.6 million (2560x1440) pixels into a 0.83’’(2cm) area, giving it seven times more dense image than the iPhone 11 Pro’s display. Cinera Edge’s micro OLED screen is the critical breakthrough of Cinera Edge’s new screen technology, as it makes ultra-high resolution possible in a goggle. Thanks to it, we can reduce Cinera’s form factor without sacrificing image quality. 500,000: 1 Contrast Ratio​The micro-OLED technology used in Cinera Edge delivers an ultra-high contrast ratio of 500,000:1 while not causing eye strain or fatigue. On our screens, colors are more vibrant and brighter. Your eyes will appreciate a broader differentiation between multiple shades of grey.  0.000001s​An OLED screen responds super fast. As a result, motion blur is mostly eliminated when displaying fast-moving objects. It also helps reduce motion sickness when watching VR content. Cinera Edge makes you feel like you’re IN the movie!Imagine when watching a thriller movie, your heart beats a little faster, and the action encapsulates you. Rather than just watching a movie, you are LIVING in it. You are part of the action and fully immersed in the movie plot! That’s what you get when watching a movie or playing a video game using Cinera Edge. With the latest advanced technology, we’ve recreated and even surpassed the immersive experience of watching a movie in a theater with:   66° Wide, 1200’’ Diagonally Cinera Edge screen is equivalent to 1200’’ from a 20m distance or 66° wide left-to-right. That is wider than the 54° screens in most cinemas and almost as big as IMAX®’s signature 70° screen.​ 38 PPD It is the only HMD that can achieve both a wide FOV and satisfy the PPD (Pixel per Degree) standard for movie theaters. Normally, one has to compromise between image quality and image size. With Cinera Edge, you can have them both! No Latticing Cinera Edge doesn’t have the latticing issues as with other low-resolution HMDs. The image is sharp and smooth. Different from 3D in cinemas where wearing 3D glasses is a must, Cinera Edge is a native 3D display that no glasses are needed. Left & Right images are displayed and transmitted to the two eyes without any overlapping or being filtered by glasses. Therefore, Cinera Edge’s 3D image is much brighter than you’ll find in cinemas.    Support Blu-ray 3D​Cinera Edge also supports 3D Blu-ray as well, so you can enjoy a vast library of high-quality 3D titles with Cinera Edge’s cinematic screen. Sound is also a key factor in delivering a cinematic experience; therefore, we add to Cinera Edge a high-quality headphone with cinema-grade configurations. Dolby Digital® Certified  Cinera Edge is Dolby Digital® certified so it can flawlessly decode the high-quality soundtracks from Blu-rays and video streaming platforms.  5.1Ch Surround Sound​With four drivers on each side, Cinera Edge simulates cinematic 5.1 surround sound and delivers straight into your ears.  Enhanced for MoviesCinera Edge’s audio is fine-tuned to modulate clear human voice, high spatial accuracy, and ample bass.  The ergonomics of Cinera Edge smartly shift more weight to its sides, taking the pressure off the front part. This makes long sessions of wearing effortless.     Inter-Pupillary Distance Adjustment ​ Eyeglasses FreeCinera Edge has a diopter adjustment so that you don’t need to wear glasses when enjoying it. The adjustment range is -8D to +3D.  With a built-in Android OS, Cinera Edge is as easy to use as your mobile phone. You can instantly stream from content services like Netflix or HBO through Wi-Fi, or play local content using a USB drive or micro SD card. Cinera Edge’s touchpad on the right-hand side allows you to swipe through the menus quickly.    Android EcosystemRunning on a full Android OS, Cinera Edge supports most content apps.​  Micro SD Card​SD card connectivity means great expandability. You will never run out of storage.  HDMI 2.0bCinera Edge also has an HDCP-supported HDMI 2.0b port. It is a shout out for an upgraded Blu-ray, gaming console, or drone experience.       HDMI Cable (type-A to type-D)Gold-plated, suitable for high bandwidth transmission up to 2160p@60Hz. Cinera Edge Carrying CaseBring Cinera Edge wherever you with this premium feeling case.  TF CardMicroSDXC UHS-I Memory Card - U3, V30, A2. Who We AreCinera was founded in 2016 by a group of movie fans who are passionate about movies, technology, and elegant product design.

The result is something you won't leave your house without in the winter. Whether you're braving the cold or walking your dog, it's engineered to keep you toasty while looking trendy. The Commuter is the obvious choice when it comes to winter accessories to keep you warm. Info graphic lovers rejoice - here's a lovely table to show you why The Commuter outperforms every - single - winter face protector out there. For those who have looked at the winter garment options out there for keeping your face and ears warm, here's what you're faced with (pun intended).Your current options fall in one of two categories: fashion or function, never both.    *Ear Band is optional.         So many products out there claim that they don't fog your glasses, however, if you're someone who's tried the options out there, chances are you know they still do. In order to prevent glasses from fogging up, your winter face garment must follow this formula.  The Commuter incorporates 4 design features  to minimize your glasses from fogging up. Allow us to show you some of the hidden features.  Disclaimer: The Commuter works best with glasses / sunglasses with nose pads that have pad arms. We're about to hit you with some science facts so grab your notebook. Did you know that your face, neck, and ears are some of the areas on your body that are the most sensitive to temperature changes?Cool and warm sensitivities are seen to vary widely by body part. The foot, lower leg and upper chest are much less sensitive than average; in comparison, the cheek, neck, back, and seat area are 2–3 times as sensitive to both cooling and warming stimuli. Every body part exhibits stronger sensitivity to cooling (1.3–1.6 times stronger) than to warming. SourceHumor us and close your eyes and picture someone placing their freezing hands around your forearm. Cold but tolerable right? Now imagine someone wrapping their freezing hands around your neck. You'd probably jump or at least flinch!Your body's reaction to feeling the cold is due to the high concentration of thermoreceptors in these areas on your body too. In addition, cold thermoreceptors are 3.5 times more common than heat thermoreceptors, making humans having a greater ability to detect the cold more than heat. SourceNext time, bundle up to cover these areas and feel the world of difference it makes. Science class dismissed. Have you ever caught yourself hunched over, shoulders tense, walking straight into the frigid wind, trying to expose as little as possible to the winter elements? You try zipping your jacket all the way up, or popping your jacket collar, or even wrapping your scarf around your ears, but they are never enough. With The Commuter, you can stand up straight, keep your chin up, and face winter head on. Oh and for all the single people out there ready to mingle, PRO TIP: Body language is one of the most influential factors to pay attention to when you want to appear more confident and attractive. So stop slouching!The Commuter is optimal in temperatures 41°F / 5°C to -13°F / -25°C. The Commuter goes on in four easy steps. Every face is unique (unless you're an identical twin), that's why we offer The Commuter in 2 sizes with 5 points of adjustability so that you can get the best fit possible. Adjust once, and don't have to adjust it again What kind of fashion brand would we be without mentioning the materials we used to make The Commuter? We hand-picked every material used, paying attention to the breathability, how it feels, and even how it handles microbials. Through the entire design process, we asked so many people this simple question:""You wear a jacket to keep your body warm in the winter, but why don't you wear something to cover your face?"" We got a wide range of answers, such as ""scarves are too bulky"", ""neck gaiters fog my glasses"", ""I'm too lazy to carry all this stuff"", just to name a few.This gave us a nice long laundry list of challenges we needed to solve. Thanks to you, our winter warriors, we've been able to create a winter product that works. But don't take our word for it; here's what our prototype testers have to say:  Conquer winter while also supporting our InDemand campaign by selecting a pledge reward below, and as a thank you, we're offering InDemand pricing.A few weeks after your order, we'll send you an email to get your head measurements, confirm your shipping address, and color.Note: US prices are approximates based on exchange rates on the day of our InDemand launch date and may vary at time of your pledge. Although we've built The Commuter using materials that are anti-microbial and odor resistant, like any garment, we still recommend that it be washed from time to time. Prototype washbag depicted in this photo.We offer a washbag as an add-on that protects and increases the longevity of your Commuter from the rough cycles of your washing machine, all while making it a no hassle process to wash your Commuter.

We’ve taken our signature sustainable coffee material and 100% waterproof protection and combined them with performance features to unlock your full athletic potential. The World runs on coffee. Now, so can you.      NOMAD features our new AquaScreen™  3.0 technology. Along with our 100% waterproof guarantee, this new dedicated membrane is lighter, twice as breathable, and built for any activity.   Made from recycled plastic bottles, this new barrier offers you the freedom to run, hike and explore—in any weather conditions. Puddles beware. NOMAD features our newest innovation, the SkyStep™ Performance Midsole. Precision air intakes placed at the heel and sole increase ventilation and breathability while maintaining total waterproof protection. Specially engineered channels flush out hot air on the downstep, and pull in cool air on the way up. This creates a lighter sneaker with increased flex and more responsive cushioning.    ClimatePartner guarantees that all climate emissions of the product will be calculated, reduced and offset via recognized carbon offset projects.

Together they created the brand LaFlore, which stands for luxury and sustainability, so women never again have to choose between style and ethics.A year of research and dozens of prototypes later, bobobark was born. Now, LaFlore is excited to welcome bebebark to the family, continuing the tradition of creating backpacks for women that merge ethics & aesthetics. You can be confident that a handbag from LaFlore is versatile, comfortable, eco-friendly, and completes any outfit with classic elegance.  Thanks to the success of our first campaign, we renovated our Parisian boutique. It’s located in the heart of le Marais and it’s now LaFlore’s flagship store. We invite you to come and meet us so we can show you the bebebark prototype in person.

Our goal is to avoid accidental breakage, whether you are chilling with your friends or hiking the highest mountain. Our hinge is EFFICIENT: it’s steady and firm like any other pair of sunglasses, but it detaches when you put high pressure that would otherwise result in breakage. Reassembling is fun and EASY. You can now live your adventures CAREFREE.             You might be thinking “The magnets will annoyingly attach to my keys or other objects.” Well, not with our sunglasses because after careful research we have included shielded magnets, which minimize the magnetic field outside the hinges.    Fashionable as luxury brands, durable as sports brands, affordable as low-priced brands.Our goal as a company is to give you the strongest, most long-lasting eyewear you'll ever need and we have followed that same philosophy for every part of the eyewear.           The lenses are produced by Carl Zeiss Vision, one of the world's leading manufacturers of eyewear lenses.Made of a transparent polyamide that is ultra-light but offers great impact resistance. The pureness of the material gives high optical quality, while naturally filtering the entire range of UV rays.Scratch-resistant, oleophobic and hydrophobic treatments seal the deal! We also give the option to have polarized lenses.*Polarized lenses are optional and can be added as ADD-ON.One of our goals was to reduce the waste of broken sunglasses plastic, so it was important to us not to increase pollution with our product. We looked for suppliers for months until we found the perfect match. A polymer mostly made of castor oil and produced with biomass energy.Don't be fooled, even though we use renewable, biomass-derived materials in our frame, our sunglasses are extremely durable. In fact, our objective is for them to be the last pair of sunglasses you'll ever buy!              We believe so much in our glasses that we backed them with a lifetime guarantee! We have a great product, using green materials, but is there something else we can do to help our planet? That’s what we said a couple of months ago when we decided that one tree will be planted for each pair of sunglasses purchased.We partnered with OneTreePlanted, a non-profit organization dedicated to global reforestation, to whom we will donate $1 to plant one tree for every pair of sunglasses purchased. We chose to support their Amazon rainforest project in Latin America. This area has been identified as a high-risk zone for deforestation and degradation due to unsustainable agricultural practices in the region. Planting trees there will help conserve habitat for jaguars and hundreds of other species living in protected areas, while providing sustainable livelihoods to local people.For more information: www.onetreeplanted.orgFrancis Pike is made for everyone in any situation. Thanks to their unique features, our sunglasses are great for sports and hobbies, but also for your daily life.With our sunglasses every backer will receive a cloth and a pouch that are both made of recycled materials.

We successfully secured contracts with companies that we source from. In fact, we flew to Turkey, Italy, and India to meet them in person to plan our entire process and we are on track for our delivery date.</p><p>2) We created our Indiegogo budget so that...<br/>a) it covers all our marketing, production, shipping and travel expenses<br/>b) leaves us enough funds in profit to help grow our company into new product lines.</p><p>We are not looking to get rich from this campaign. We want your support to help us build our brand.</p><p>3) Some asked us how we got our prices so low, they seem too low. That's simple. Our fabric Manufacturers and our Tailors know this is an Indiegogo campaign and arranged lower prices to support us. This is only helpful for them in the long terms as we will send all future orders to them. They help us now and they see more business from us in the future.</p><p>4) Some of our backers asked about sizing concerns. Gurri or his design team will be available on video chat to help you through the process (free).</p><p>Our suits are sold on Indiegogo at very low-profit margins. As you can know this suit sells in stores for over $3600 and you are buying it at $499 (75% off when you buy three or more).

while eliminating the middlemen and offering the suits at 80% below markup.""This project has been a dream of mine since I ventured into men's fashion""- Gurri Kahlon (Men's Fashion Designer)      The Billionaire Suit collection consists of all the essential colors which complete every man's wardrobe.  The essential colors (in order of importance) are:  Navy, Black, Greys and a Navy Stripe Power Suit.  You will get personalised attention from Gurri Kahlon. After your order, we will schedule your sizing call with Gurri Kahlon, where he will get your measurements and discuss the right suit and cut based on your physique and complexion.Your suit will be made according to your unique body.  You must understand that you will receive a true bespoke experience in the comfort of your own home. We will schedule a video, sizing call between you and the designer himself, Gurri Kahlon. Gurri will get your measurements and suggest the best cut, color and design suitable for your complexion and physique.   


If your suit does not fit with perfection, we will make another one and another one and another one until it fits like a glove and until you have a BIG Smile on your face.    
We are in this together, for the long haul.  ""I'm in this for the long haul with my clients, I value the relationship more than any profit"" - Gurri Kahlon 
For minor alterations, (such as hems, etc.) we will likely refer you to local alterations but in the rare case that your suit is a misfit, we will surely replace it for you.  No questions asked.  
Minor alteration costs:  To keep things simple, we request that our clients pay their local facility for minor alterations if required.  As a reimbursement and a token of our appreciation, you will receive a free designer shirt worth $400 plus $150 in credit on any future orders.  
Point by point, we are going to walk you through the five main reasons that make the Billionaire Suit a must have for every man's wardrobe. There are five key factors which require a microscopic level of attention towards detail which set apart a luxury suit like the Billionaire Suit from the average suits that are typically found on the rack We use only natural and eco-friendly fabric.  The production of luxury items is known to leave a heavy footprint on our planet; our fabric is a blend of low emissions production fabric comprised of Virgin Wool, Tencil and Lycra for ultra comfort and flexibility.We are producing some of the world's most advanced fabric which leaves a near zero footprint on our planet.  Your Billionaire Suit Fabric is proprietary blend of Natural and Tech fibers consisting of Wool, Tencil and Lycra.   The Billionaire Articles Fabric is a luxury fabric which is made from 100% virgin Australian lamb’s wool with a quality standard of 16 microns.  Due to unique weaving technology and micron count, the wool fabric stays cool during summer and keeps you warm in the winter.   

Gurri Kahlon explains the post production phase of the Billionaire Articles Luxury Fabric which is being prepared for The Billionaire Suit. 
Your suit will be made using our Signature Cross-Ply, Traveller fabric which is a luxury, wrinkle-resistant, blended-wool fabric.  This high-twist, super 140's fabric holds a crease well, wrinkles less, drops wrinkles quickly and has a natural stretch making it ideal for the modern traveler.
 Bespoke, Artisan construction, is the epitome of a Billionaire Suit and we have teamed up with the masters of this art.
A great amount of attention towards detail is absorbed by each and every suit.  Each suit is carefully handcrafted by skilled, Italian Artisans who have been making luxury suits for decades as their primary profession.  
You can count every stitch on your lapel and feel how well the suit will mould to your body as if it were chiseled to perfection.  It is only fair to say that these Artisans pour their heart and soul into their workmanship and exercise their craft purely out of passion.
 
Firstly, No Horse is harmed in this process.  In the good old days, suits were made using horse canvas in the interlining of the jacket; the purpose behind this practice is, that the natural elasticity of horse hair, allows the jacket to slowly mould to your body, it accentuates your masculinity while creating a perfect fit as you wear it.  and the best part is: this a completely harmless process, the horsehair is simply from the brushings of the horse.

This process is quite tedious and labor intense and as you can imagine, it is not a common practice in current times. You'll be glad to know that each of these limited 1500 suits will be constructed using horsehair canvas and will last for a lifetime. Luxury suits of this caliber are never mass produced.  A Billionaire suit should be exclusive not only in its fabric and design but also in its scarce nature, therefore, to maintain exclusivity, we will hand embroider your name on your suit.  The Gurri Kahlon label is a growing brand in today's fashion industry and his recent designs for one of England's oldest brands have gained a great deal of recognition over the past year.  Gurri Kahlon has designed a variety of unique garments for celebrities, politicians and royalty on a global scale. Typically, the average cost of a Gurri Kahlon designer garment is priced in the thousands but Gurri wants to desgin for the many, not just the few; it is now his goal to design garments without compromising on his vision of elaborate runway fashion and make them affordable for the modern gentleman. Although, your suit will be completely customisable; these two cuts are the most popular and never go out of style so you can feel confident wearing your suit to the office, a formal event or an evening cocktail with friends.   THE MODERNO DESIGN:The Moderno Design is inspired by the Colonial English era. The wide peak lapels and tapered cut make this design a truly unique and modern hi-fashion power suit. THE CLASSICO DESIGN:The Classico design is inspired by the traditional Italian Power Suit.  The risen notch lapel and a tapered cut give this design a unique appeal.Dress it down: You can wear your suit in a formal dressed up fashion or you can wear it in a more casual environment without a tie or collared shirt. We teamed up with a fourth generation tailoring facility. This family of tailors and their ancestors have been producing artisan, bespoke suits since the late 17th Century. By teaming up directly with this tailoring facility, we are able to shave thousands off our production costs which allows us to make these suits of the highest quality for an unheard-of price.  Once you have selected the package of your choice and your order is placed, we will send you a unique link which will take you to our internal order details page.  On this page, you will select the design and color of your suit(s) along with selecting your fit and size or even submitting some measurements if required.  If at any point you require assistance, you will get to speak with someone or even the designer Gurri Kahlon for sizing and fitting help.  Our goal is to make sure that you walk away with a Billionaire Suit that you can be proud to wear for a lifetime.
Delivery Time Table: 
Fabric Sourcing Period:2-3 weeks 
Production Period:3-4 weeks 
Estimated Delivery:Estimated 4- 6 weeks after sizing call 

 Luxury brands markup their costs by a minimum of 600% due to middlemen and overhead expenses.  We made it our mission to get past all of it and figured out a way to offer these suits to you at a fair and affordable price. By reaching out directly to the fine mills of fashion powerhouses and teaming up directly with an artisan tailoring house, we were able to source the fabric and stitch the suits for a very impressive price.

In February, 2018... We embarked on a journey and faced many challenges to bring our vision of the Billionaire suit to life.  Our Mission was to make a luxury, designer suit affordable for the modern man.  Today, we are proud to announce that For the First Time Ever, a designer collection of Billionaire quality fabric suits, with original tags, is offered - Without the Luxury Markup.In our journey, We faced many challenges created by upset middlemen and even from pioneers within the fashion industry who tried relentlessly to stop us from gaining any kind of traction. But every-time they tried to knock us down, we got back up.  In the end, after months of hard work and dedication, we succeeded in what may be one of the first steps towards reforming the designer fashion industry forever...Gurri Kahlon- Founder and Chief DesignerSince childhood, tirelessly listening to the tales of his ancestors, Gurri has been mesmerised by the ""Gentlemen Suit and Boot Era"". Gurri's family has a legacy of associating with Indian and European royalty dating back to the era of the British India Empire. His Great Grandfather was a renowned Polo Athlete and, a Friend of Kings.Today, Gurri owns  his own Designer Label (Gurri Kahlon), a men's luxury garment line where he designs a variety of bespoke items for his clients. Lloyd Jacob- CMOLloyd has over 14 years of experience in leading companies to success. His past companies have been part of Silicon Valley's 'Y Combinator' and he is a respected figure in the entrepreneurial community of the Valley. Lloyd is a philanthropist who devotes a significant amount of his time mentoring college students and aspiring entrepreneurs of the Silicon Valley. Similar to Gurri, Lloyd has a fine taste in clothing and is using his passion to grow Gurri Kahlon clothing.  Thank you for your support Indiegogo community!Risks and challengesWe've taken steps to ensure our Indiegogo campaign is a success and that we successfully deliver the suits to our backers.1) We started first with the two most important elements: Fabric and the Tailors. We successfully secured contracts with companies that we source from. In fact, we flew to Turkey, Italy, and India to meet them in person to plan our entire process and we are on track for our delivery date.2) We created our Indiegogo budget so that...a) it covers all our marketing, production, shipping and travel expensesb) leaves us enough funds in profit to help grow our company into new product lines.We are not looking to get rich from this campaign. We want your support to help us build our brand.3) Some asked us how we got our prices so low, they seem too low. That's simple. Our fabric Manufacturers and our Tailors know this is an Indiegogo campaign and arranged lower prices to support us. This is only helpful for them in the long terms as we will send all future orders to them. They help us now and they see more business from us in the future.4) Some of our backers asked about sizing concerns. Gurri or his design team will be available on video chat to help you through the process (free).Our suits are sold on Indiegogo at very low-profit margins. As you can know this suit sells in stores for over $3600 and you are buying it at $499 (75% off when you buy three or more). That being the case, if by any chance you need minor alternations, you may incur some costs from your local tailor (typically $20-60). We won't be able to refund this costs, as you are saving over $3000 on this suit. Lastly, since each suit is custom made, we do not offer any refunds or returns. We will do our best to make sure the suit looks great on you- thats why we are willing to get on video calls with you and help you measure- no matter where you are in the world!If you have any other concerns, feel free to reach out to us directly:Email: Gurri@GurriKahlon.com, Gurri@BillionaireArticles.comWhatsapp / Telegram: +91 9814111562Thank you!",114.0,4,"1 Campaign

<p><strong><i>Pitot Watches - F/A-18 Super Hornet Inspired Pilot Watch</i></strong></p>
<p>Since 1886, the time when Carl Benz applied for a patent for his vehicle powered by a gas engine, the birth certificate of the modern-day automobile, humanity has been obsessed with going faster. First, it was the automobile, then our obsession evolved into aircraft with Wilbur and Orville Wright making their first four brief flights at Kitty Hawk. From speed on the ground to speed in the air, we’ve constantly challenged ourselves to push through to new levels. Even with all of humanity's past technological ingenuity, we sometimes come to points in time where even we ourselves are taken aback by our own designs. That feeling of shock, awe, excitement, and sheer power all in one—is something most of us feel when we hear or see a F/A-18 Super Hornet streaking through the skies. An aircraft built for speed, agility, and multi-role capabilities, it truly is a Swiss Army knife of the skies… So it only seemed fitting that we designed a Swiss-powered wristwatch inspired by the one and only—F/A-18 Super Hornet.</p>
<p><strong><i>Introducing Pitot Watches’ F/A-18 Super Hornet inspired wristwatch</i></strong></p>
<p>My name is Thomas, a former RDAF aircraft mechanic. I’ve been around incredible pieces of engineering in the form of aircraft all of my life, and with this watch, I’ve taken inspiration from the things I love to create a watch designed to make you feel the way you feel watching a fighter jet fly through the skies. Inspired by the wing profile, foldable wings, square air-intake, jettison button, and 2x exhausts this watch - like the F/A-18-is something to look at.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<p>-Powered by a Swiss Ronda Quartz movement with Chronograph and Tachymeter complications</p>
<p>-Titanium case for lightweight, strength, and scratch-resistant durability<br/>-Durable rubber strap with secure fold-over clasp<br/>-F/A-18 silhouette etched rear case back</p>
<p><strong>Three Editions:</strong></p>
<p>-Green edition inspired by cockpit digital displays<br/>-Light blue edition to pay tribute to the upcoming Top Gun Maverick movie<br/>-Blue to pay homage to the legendary Blue Angels</p>
<p>Help me bring this fantastic watch that pays homage to a fantastic flying machine in the F/A-18 into a reality! Any support is much appreciated, I’m positive you’ll love the watch!</p>

<p>I use crowdfunding to help watches become a reality. After my years in the airforce, I became a product developer in the civil and now building up a new watch brand with fighter jets inspired watches.</p>
<p>Our first watches are the F-14 Tomcat-inspired ones, which we just recently delivered with help from backers on both Indiegogo and Kickstarter. </p>
<p>Our second watch is the F/A-18 Super Hornet-inspired watch, which we now seek funds for to help with prototype production, so we can launch the big Kickstarter with the prototypes ready later in early 2022.</p>

<p><strong><i><i>F/A-18 Super Hornet history</i></i></strong></p>
<div>
<p>The Boeing F / A-18E / F Super Hornet is a US 4.5. generation jet fighters are available in two versions: F / A-18E with one seat and F / A-18F with two seats.</p>
<p>The Super Hornet first flew in 1995 and was put into production in 1997 after Boeing took over McDonnell Douglas in July of that year. The aircraft has replaced the Grumman F-14 Tomcat as the U.S. Navy's air superiority fighter. It can be used from land as well as from aircraft carriers and on its first voyage in 2002 it was used for the first time in combat.</p>
<p>The Super Hornet is also used by the Australian Air Force (RAAF), which has ordered 24 two-seater aircraft to replace the F-111.</p>
<p>Some of the inspiration for our new F/A-18 Super Hornet inspired watch come from the new Top Gun:Maverick movie where they fly the Super Hornet.<br/><br/>There were three painted Super Hornet to assist on the shooting. After the filming, one of the Super Hornet was transferred to the US Navy demo team Blue Angels and now flying as the first F/A-18 Super Hornet delivered in the Blue Angels paintscheme.</p>

Since 1886, the time when Carl Benz applied for a patent for his vehicle powered by a gas engine, the birth certificate of the modern-day automobile, humanity has been obsessed with going faster. First, it was the automobile, then our obsession evolved into aircraft with Wilbur and Orville Wright making their first four brief flights at Kitty Hawk. From speed on the ground to speed in the air, we’ve constantly challenged ourselves to push through to new levels. Even with all of humanity's past technological ingenuity, we sometimes come to points in time where even we ourselves are taken aback by our own designs. That feeling of shock, awe, excitement, and sheer power all in one—is something most of us feel when we hear or see a F/A-18 Super Hornet streaking through the skies. An aircraft built for speed, agility, and multi-role capabilities, it truly is a Swiss Army knife of the skies… So it only seemed fitting that we designed a Swiss-powered wristwatch inspired by the one and only—F/A-18 Super Hornet.
Introducing Pitot Watches’ F/A-18 Super Hornet inspired wristwatch
My name is Thomas, a former RDAF aircraft mechanic. I’ve been around incredible pieces of engineering in the form of aircraft all of my life, and with this watch, I’ve taken inspiration from the things I love to create a watch designed to make you feel the way you feel watching a fighter jet fly through the skies. Inspired by the wing profile, foldable wings, square air-intake, jettison button, and 2x exhausts this watch - like the F/A-18-is something to look at.
Features:
-Powered by a Swiss Ronda Quartz movement with Chronograph and Tachymeter complications
-Titanium case for lightweight, strength, and scratch-resistant durability-Durable rubber strap with secure fold-over clasp-F/A-18 silhouette etched rear case back
Three Editions:
-Green edition inspired by cockpit digital displays-Light blue edition to pay tribute to the upcoming Top Gun Maverick movie-Blue to pay homage to the legendary Blue Angels
Help me bring this fantastic watch that pays homage to a fantastic flying machine in the F/A-18 into a reality! Any support is much appreciated, I’m positive you’ll love the watch!

HUD display added - Second hand updated

HUD display added, inspired from a carrier landing with ILS and approach distance and height - Second hand added pattern from the canopy ejection handle

 

We are applying to use the Blue Angels logo and hopefully, we will be approved for this design.
 
The watch is inspired by key features from the F/A-18 Super Hornet and incorporated into the watch case, subdial buttons, crown, and dial.

We are using aircraft titanium material for the watch case and a lightweight smart rubber strap with a smart and practical fold-over clasp.

I use crowdfunding to help watches become a reality. After my years in the airforce, I became a product developer in the civil and now building up a new watch brand with fighter jets inspired watches.
Our first watches are the F-14 Tomcat-inspired ones, which we just recently delivered with help from backers on both Indiegogo and Kickstarter. 
Our second watch is the F/A-18 Super Hornet-inspired watch, which we now seek funds for to help with prototype production, so we can launch the big Kickstarter with the prototypes ready later in early 2022.

F/A-18 Super Hornet history

The Boeing F / A-18E / F Super Hornet is a US 4.5. generation jet fighters are available in two versions: F / A-18E with one seat and F / A-18F with two seats.
The Super Hornet first flew in 1995 and was put into production in 1997 after Boeing took over McDonnell Douglas in July of that year. The aircraft has replaced the Grumman F-14 Tomcat as the U.S. Navy's air superiority fighter. It can be used from land as well as from aircraft carriers and on its first voyage in 2002 it was used for the first time in combat.
The Super Hornet is also used by the Australian Air Force (RAAF), which has ordered 24 two-seater aircraft to replace the F-111.
Some of the inspiration for our new F/A-18 Super Hornet inspired watch come from the new Top Gun:Maverick movie where they fly the Super Hornet.There were three painted Super Hornet to assist on the shooting. After the filming, one of the Super Hornet was transferred to the US Navy demo team Blue Angels and now flying as the first F/A-18 Super Hornet delivered in the Blue Angels paintscheme.

Long-awaited Top Gun: Maverick

 


What We Need & What You Get
We seek funding to produce a minimum of three prototypes or more and marketing the Kickstarter campaign. The prototypes take 55 days to produce (after releasing the funding from IGG and the invoice to production being verified).
The F/A-18 Super Hornet watch itself comes in three different color editions. The watch is inspired by the wings profile, foldable wingtips, engine exhaust, cockpit button, and digital displays.

The green dial editions are inspired by the digital displays in the cockpit.
The blue/yellow is inspired by the Blue Angels.
The light blue is inspired by the new Top Gun: Maverick movie


We offer these watches for only €225 for 15 backers since the help we are getting by having funds this early makes the project possible, and we want to reward that with a low price for the backers who help with this to become a reality!

 

 

 


 
The funding we reach goes to the production of the prototypes and marketing of the Kickstarter campaign (I have run 5 campaigns already and tried this before, so I'm sure we will reach the funding with help from new and previous backers).
You can check out our previous F-14 campaigns, both here on Indiegogo and on Kickstarter.  I started with prototype funding, then made the prototypes, launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund for production, made the production, and then delivered the watches to all over the world.

Risks & Challenges
With the experience from previous campaigns in the time of a pandemic, we learned a lot, and know what it takes to deliver a watch, all the way from the first sketches, production and to carefully pack the watches and ship them out.
From previous funding results, we managed to get an investor on board to help grow the company in the direction we want, and we are now a company with 4 owners and a board of directors, and an advisory board.
Our goal is not to stay a microbrand, and I have dedicated my life to build up this watch company, I take it very seriously and we already came far in this our fourth year now as a company.

A broad concept that can be described as a product that has ""aged"". A product that has improved over time, like some cigars for example.Patina has many functions, like being a kind of ""seal"" on metal for example, but for us, the most important seems to be that it represents the relationship between the object and its owner.The common history they will have written together, day after day, month after month, year after year. The patina is easily removed, but if you let it grow, the PUNCH BRACELET will have changes in color that will make it unique.There lies all the beauty of the patina.⁠⁠ 316L Stainless Steel body, the inalterableSometimes refered as Marine Grade Stainless Steel, used in a variety of fields such as the petrochemical industry, water treatment, medical implants, or high-end diving watches, 316L is the superior choice for high corrosion and high temperature applications. Combining beads and body materials, the PUNCH BRACELET by LES FINES LAMES exists in 10 versions.Each version of the PUNCH BRACELET by LES FINES LAMES is available as :

<h3>Full Skeleton Tourbillon watch - A passion to create a watch that has never been created</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>""Why hide the magical movement of the Tourbillon?""</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627826752/edc5lcdlmw6hatjsujvp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The project to create THE ARCHER series started when the chief designer of ZEROOTIME, SYUU, asked himself this question. In common mechanical watches, a plate is imbedded to fix the complex nature of the movement. Because of this plate, the majority of the movement itself is often hidden away. There are some designs such as the Open Heart model with a hole in the dial, still only a small section of the movement can be seen. We cannot let the beautiful mechanics of the watch go to waste. For all watch enthusiasts to enjoy the beauty of the Tourbillon movement, ZEROOTIME was determined to find a solution. After years of research and development, the T1 &amp; T2 THE ARCHER series, ZEROOTIME's completely original full skeleton tourbillon wristwatch was born.</p>

<p><strong>An innovative skeleton frame</strong></p>
<p>ZEROO developed an innovative skeleton frame by removing the plate which fixes the movement of the watch. A perfect balance between firmly stabilizing the movement and enjoying the full view of the movement has been achieved.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Complicated tourbillon movement</strong></p>
<p>The movement, which is the heart of the watch, was created especially for the ZEROO full skeleton tourbillon in collaboration with tourbillon specialist manufacturers.</p>
<p>The markers around the 45 minutes indicator on the T1's inner bezel have been removed, to enjoy viewing the rotation of the Tourbillon from all angles.</p>

<p><strong>The leather strap with a convenient D-Buckle</strong></p>
<p>The case-back engraving is placed along the edge, forming a gentle curve to match the round form of the case. The strap is made out of black leather with a D-Buckle (the D of the D-Buckle comes from the initial letter of deployment). Perlage, a traditional and popular type of finishing used in many luxury brand watches, is applied on the inside.</p>

<p><strong>360° full skeleton watch design</strong></p>
<p>Due to the exposed skeleton movement, the watch case too had to be made into a skeleton structure. Much focus was given on being able to enjoy the view of the movement from the side exterior. ZEROOTIME also developed in-house a full skeleton exclusive case. The frame case is made out of 316L stainless steel which is the same material used in luxury watch brands. Crystal glass which has high durability and transparency is used for the watch casing, for increased visibility of the inner mechanism from the side exterior of the watch. By achieving a high level of transparency, the precise movement of the carriage can be enjoyed looking at.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627827673/gqcsfhy56dbkek5idlro.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Highly transparent crystal glass case middle</strong></p>
<p>The square case allows a better view of the entire movement. The side view of the T2 is already beautiful, but its rear view is exceptional. The movement looks as if it is floating, amidst the robust but highly transparent crystal glass case middle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628516113/hlpei8meq5sdz7dvlwbx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>An exclusive strap perfectly matches the T2 square case</strong></p>
<p>The 1 inch (25 mm) width strap firmly supports the watch case. The leather strap is made out of alligator leather and has a pin buckle. The strap has a classy look which is a perfect match with the case and watch face. A rubber ring has been added to the crown, not only to enhance its usability but to add some charm in the watch's design.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Utilizing crystal glass on case middle</h3>
<p><strong>The T1 round case - specially developed to enjoy the best view of the tourbillon movement from all angles</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627827847/e90xe43xizzwcarxtbze.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The T2 square case - removing all parts that obstruct the view of the movement just as transparent and luminous as the T1, and the gentle arc shape of the case back fits comfortably around your wrist</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627827873/wy2qgtpyxmxrcvwxhxuj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although crystal glass and sapphire crystal have the same degree of transparency, the cost of crystal glass is about half of that of sapphire crystal, making it an effective material. Crystal glass has a hardness of 7 Mohs, which is more than enough to be used as a material for the case middle.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Hand-wind Tourbillon movement</h3> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/i/Nichikura/_.gif"" src=""""/><p> </p>
<p>The ZEROO T1 &amp; T2 are manual winding timepieces. You can wind the spring by turning the crown clockwise. Since the crown is the part which is most often used, a lot of consideration has been given to create it in the best size and usability.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Luminova® luminous on the hands and index</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627828591/sgjd2jsm2krryg2fncvl.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>To let the wearer enjoy the movement as well as easily tell the time, a considerable amount of time was spent studying the optimal hand thickness and luminous surface area and to realize the transparency of the clock hands. LumiNova® makes the hands and index luminous, allowing you to instantly know the time even in the dark.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Dial and case back using scratch-resistant sapphire crystal</h3>

<p>By mounting 1st grade sapphire glass on the top and bottom of the case, the beautiful movement of the Tourbillon can be appreciated from all angles with its high transparency and trusted durability.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The double mainspring mechanism allows up to 70 hours of power reserve</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631196546/oyo9xb89rmhzwwngjmj4.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You can also enjoy viewing the beauty and precision of the springs winding-up.</p>
<p>*Due to the delicate nature of the watch, we recommend no more than 30 rotations at a time </p>
<p>*To avoid overwind the watch, please pay attention to winding and stop winding if you feel resistance from the crown</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The watch strap really matters to us </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629436280/ngaakam7sodjradmwmct.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The ZEROO straps offers black, Blue and Green alligator leather, polished to perfectly complement the transparency of the timepiece. Stitched by hand, it has been scrupulously designed down to the pitch on the back. The easy-click spring bar allows for easy replacement and change of watch straps.</p>

<p>The world's three grand complications are the tourbillon, the minute repeater, and the perpetual calendar, and wristwatches containing any one of these are sold by luxury watch brands for hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br/>By relying on crowdfunding (where we circumvent barriers like retail costs, brand markups, showroom fees, expensive exhibitions) and delivering to-order watches directly to passionate consumers, we have been able to make and sell watches at their ‘true cost’.</p>

<h3>THE MAKING OF ZEROO FULL SKELETON TOURBILLON</h3>
<div> </div>
<p>We created a simple video to show you the design process of the full skeleton case. The ZEROOTIME staff became so excited when watching this 3D modeling. It was a decisive moment which reassured the possibility to create a watch that has never been made before.</p>

<h3>An original case to suit the beauty of the tourbillon movement</h3>

<p>The team was very particular on creating an outstanding case that rightfully showcased the craftsmanship of the movement, as its beauty could only be fully appreciated with a full skeleton design. Light needs to reach all angles in order to appreciate the beauty of the movement: in order to achieve this concept, there was a need to develop an entirely transparent case from scratch. In order to let the slightest of more light, the lug pieces are also made in skeleton. It was especially difficult to realize the skeleton design for the side exterior, which resulted in many trials until reaching a convincing quality.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3yzegK34aU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>It is common in a Tourbillon design to mount the carriage on the 6 o'clock mark, however as the watch strap needs to be attached in this area, light cannot be captured into the watch body. Hence, the carriage in the ZEROO T1 &amp; T2 was moved to the 9 o'clock mark to realize the beautiful and transparent full skeleton tourbillon.</p>
<p>Clock hands are also crafted in a skeleton design. Countless revisions and fine adjustments were made so that the clock hands do not get in the way of viewing the movement, as well as to serve its main functionality to read time with ease.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Package</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A suitable watch case for the ZEROO T1 &amp; T2 THE ARCHER has been developed with extra consideration. Each watch even comes with a 2-year warranty and sits upon a leather cushion inside its premium wooden case (with beautiful Rolls-Royce-inspired doors) that also doubles as the warranty certificate.</p>

<p>ZEROO T1 &amp; T2 THE ARCHER are manufactured in China. Manufacturing of watch parts used by watchmakers all over the world, including luxury Swiss watch brands, can hardly be discussed without taking into account Chinese manufacturing technology.</p>
<p>All products by ZEROOTIME are originally designed at the company's Tokyo Studio. To realize ZEROOTIME's policy - to provide high quality products affordably - a lot of thought is put into product development on a daily basis. Once mock-ups are created in-house, thorough communication is made with watch parts manufacturers. Multiple test runs are repeated under rigorous quality check whether it is the manufacturing of the parts or creating a sample product.</p>

</div></div>","A Full Skeleton Tourbillon watch full of light and transparency
 

 
 
An innovative Full Skeleton Tourbillon watch with the scratch-resistant sapphire glass
 

 
An ultimate form of transparency realized by merging the luxuriousness of tourbillon watches, one of the world's three grand complications, with a full skeleton body to allow a 360-degree view of the elegant and beautiful inner structure.
 
The tourbillon movement, which is the heart of the watch, dazzles all who see it
 
 
Original full skeleton case developed in-house. The frame case is made out of 316L stainless steel which is the same material used in luxury watch brands. The case that brings out the transparency and clearness of the watch utilizes crystal glass. A truly unique and special wristwatch - a tourbillon which is one of the most complex of mechanical complications - has been created.

Full Skeleton Tourbillon watch - A passion to create a watch that has never been created
 
""Why hide the magical movement of the Tourbillon?""
 

 
The project to create THE ARCHER series started when the chief designer of ZEROOTIME, SYUU, asked himself this question. In common mechanical watches, a plate is imbedded to fix the complex nature of the movement. Because of this plate, the majority of the movement itself is often hidden away. There are some designs such as the Open Heart model with a hole in the dial, still only a small section of the movement can be seen. We cannot let the beautiful mechanics of the watch go to waste. For all watch enthusiasts to enjoy the beauty of the Tourbillon movement, ZEROOTIME was determined to find a solution. After years of research and development, the T1 & T2 THE ARCHER series, ZEROOTIME's completely original full skeleton tourbillon wristwatch was born.
 

ZEROO T1 THE ARCHER FULL SKELETON TOURBILLON ROUND - a shimmering transparency that brightens your day

 
T1 Watch case diameter: 43mm
Available in 6 colors:

A Full Skeleton Tourbillon that seeks for the ""ultimate form of transparency""

An innovative skeleton frame
ZEROO developed an innovative skeleton frame by removing the plate which fixes the movement of the watch. A perfect balance between firmly stabilizing the movement and enjoying the full view of the movement has been achieved.
 

Complicated tourbillon movement
The movement, which is the heart of the watch, was created especially for the ZEROO full skeleton tourbillon in collaboration with tourbillon specialist manufacturers.
The markers around the 45 minutes indicator on the T1's inner bezel have been removed, to enjoy viewing the rotation of the Tourbillon from all angles.
 

The leather strap with a convenient D-Buckle
The case-back engraving is placed along the edge, forming a gentle curve to match the round form of the case. The strap is made out of black leather with a D-Buckle (the D of the D-Buckle comes from the initial letter of deployment). Perlage, a traditional and popular type of finishing used in many luxury brand watches, is applied on the inside.
 

ZEROO T2 THE ARCHER FULL SKELETON TOURBILLON SQUARE - like a jewel that adds a special color to your everyday life

T2 Watch case diameter: 39mm
Available in 6 colors:

A Full Skeleton Tourbillon that seeks for the ""ultimate form of transparency""

360° full skeleton watch design
Due to the exposed skeleton movement, the watch case too had to be made into a skeleton structure. Much focus was given on being able to enjoy the view of the movement from the side exterior. ZEROOTIME also developed in-house a full skeleton exclusive case. The frame case is made out of 316L stainless steel which is the same material used in luxury watch brands. Crystal glass which has high durability and transparency is used for the watch casing, for increased visibility of the inner mechanism from the side exterior of the watch. By achieving a high level of transparency, the precise movement of the carriage can be enjoyed looking at.
 

Highly transparent crystal glass case middle
The square case allows a better view of the entire movement. The side view of the T2 is already beautiful, but its rear view is exceptional. The movement looks as if it is floating, amidst the robust but highly transparent crystal glass case middle.
 

An exclusive strap perfectly matches the T2 square case
The 1 inch (25 mm) width strap firmly supports the watch case. The leather strap is made out of alligator leather and has a pin buckle. The strap has a classy look which is a perfect match with the case and watch face. A rubber ring has been added to the crown, not only to enhance its usability but to add some charm in the watch's design.
 
Utilizing crystal glass on case middle
The T1 round case - specially developed to enjoy the best view of the tourbillon movement from all angles

 
The T2 square case - removing all parts that obstruct the view of the movement just as transparent and luminous as the T1, and the gentle arc shape of the case back fits comfortably around your wrist

 
Although crystal glass and sapphire crystal have the same degree of transparency, the cost of crystal glass is about half of that of sapphire crystal, making it an effective material. Crystal glass has a hardness of 7 Mohs, which is more than enough to be used as a material for the case middle.
 
Hand-wind Tourbillon movement  
The ZEROO T1 & T2 are manual winding timepieces. You can wind the spring by turning the crown clockwise. Since the crown is the part which is most often used, a lot of consideration has been given to create it in the best size and usability.
 
Luminova® luminous on the hands and index

To let the wearer enjoy the movement as well as easily tell the time, a considerable amount of time was spent studying the optimal hand thickness and luminous surface area and to realize the transparency of the clock hands. LumiNova® makes the hands and index luminous, allowing you to instantly know the time even in the dark.
 
Dial and case back using scratch-resistant sapphire crystal
 

By mounting 1st grade sapphire glass on the top and bottom of the case, the beautiful movement of the Tourbillon can be appreciated from all angles with its high transparency and trusted durability.
 
The double mainspring mechanism allows up to 70 hours of power reserve

You can also enjoy viewing the beauty and precision of the springs winding-up.
*Due to the delicate nature of the watch, we recommend no more than 30 rotations at a time 
*To avoid overwind the watch, please pay attention to winding and stop winding if you feel resistance from the crown
 
The watch strap really matters to us 

The ZEROO straps offers black, Blue and Green alligator leather, polished to perfectly complement the transparency of the timepiece. Stitched by hand, it has been scrupulously designed down to the pitch on the back. The easy-click spring bar allows for easy replacement and change of watch straps.
 
Comparison of tourbillon's value to the price of ZEROO T1 & T2

 
The world's three grand complications are the tourbillon, the minute repeater, and the perpetual calendar, and wristwatches containing any one of these are sold by luxury watch brands for hundreds of thousands of dollars.By relying on crowdfunding (where we circumvent barriers like retail costs, brand markups, showroom fees, expensive exhibitions) and delivering to-order watches directly to passionate consumers, we have been able to make and sell watches at their ‘true cost’.

THE MAKING OF ZEROO FULL SKELETON TOURBILLON
 
We created a simple video to show you the design process of the full skeleton case. The ZEROOTIME staff became so excited when watching this 3D modeling. It was a decisive moment which reassured the possibility to create a watch that has never been made before.


 

 
An original case to suit the beauty of the tourbillon movement

The team was very particular on creating an outstanding case that rightfully showcased the craftsmanship of the movement, as its beauty could only be fully appreciated with a full skeleton design. Light needs to reach all angles in order to appreciate the beauty of the movement: in order to achieve this concept, there was a need to develop an entirely transparent case from scratch. In order to let the slightest of more light, the lug pieces are also made in skeleton. It was especially difficult to realize the skeleton design for the side exterior, which resulted in many trials until reaching a convincing quality.

 
It is common in a Tourbillon design to mount the carriage on the 6 o'clock mark, however as the watch strap needs to be attached in this area, light cannot be captured into the watch body. Hence, the carriage in the ZEROO T1 & T2 was moved to the 9 o'clock mark to realize the beautiful and transparent full skeleton tourbillon.
Clock hands are also crafted in a skeleton design. Countless revisions and fine adjustments were made so that the clock hands do not get in the way of viewing the movement, as well as to serve its main functionality to read time with ease.
 
Package
 
A suitable watch case for the ZEROO T1 & T2 THE ARCHER has been developed with extra consideration. Each watch even comes with a 2-year warranty and sits upon a leather cushion inside its premium wooden case (with beautiful Rolls-Royce-inspired doors) that also doubles as the warranty certificate.

 
JAPAN Quality

ZEROO T1 & T2 THE ARCHER are manufactured in China. Manufacturing of watch parts used by watchmakers all over the world, including luxury Swiss watch brands, can hardly be discussed without taking into account Chinese manufacturing technology.
All products by ZEROOTIME are originally designed at the company's Tokyo Studio. To realize ZEROOTIME's policy - to provide high quality products affordably - a lot of thought is put into product development on a daily basis. Once mock-ups are created in-house, thorough communication is made with watch parts manufacturers. Multiple test runs are repeated under rigorous quality check whether it is the manufacturing of the parts or creating a sample product.
By managing such processes internally instead of outsourcing, speedy product development, reliable quality and cost reduction has been realized.
Final inspection and quality control of all products are conducted at the Tokyo Studio.
If there are any products that don't meet the required standard, they are disassembled to be adjusted and reconstructed, then undergo a final checking process such as water resistance test to ensure that only finished products with guaranteed quality are shipped.

It is the key ingredient to making ATTENU8™ a success and frankly, we know we cannot do it without you.</p><p><br/>We want to set the gold standard of ear plugs and more importantly, rid the notion that ear plugs are ‘uncool’ and encourage the use of hearing protection in our daily lives. This starts with encouraging the use of ear plugs and education on how to attain the correct fit to maximise sound attenuation.</p><p><br/>We believe in continuous reiteration to give our end users the ideal experience.

 Issues with other ear plugs#1 Foam ear plugs are difficult to fit:When we set out to create ATTENU8™, we talked to many ear plug users. Majority who used foam ear plugs found it wasteful to regularly throw them away. They also struggled to attain the right fit which affected sound reduction. Does this look familiar to you? A research participant trying to fit foam ear plugsIn 2013, a research investigated the relationship between depth of insertion and sound reduction with foam ear plugs. Even with instructions provided, the subjects could not achieve the standard insertion of 50%-60% but only a 15%-20% fit. (Berger, 2013). Foam ear plugs are malleable, making it harder to achieve a deeper fit in our ear canals.  #2 Bulky metal-bodied ear plugs with 'melting' foam tips:Those who have used other metal-bodied ear plugs for sleeping, feedback that they were too big and uncomfortable. They wanted something smaller. They also complained that the foam tips were not durable and 'melts' onto the metal stem - making it a hassle to clean off and replace:'Melted' foam tips#3 Improper usage of ear plugs:Lastly, with the COVID-19 outbreak, many were forced to work from home. This may be the new normal - yay or nay? But regardless, users started using their sleeping ear plugs during the day, and their day ear plugs for sleeping at night - sometimes this worked out, but sometimes it didn't. Our SolutionSimply introducing another ear plug that claims to be 'more effective or comfortable' won't cut it because that's what users already expect.When you least expect it, you can count on ATTENU8™ to reduce that sudden f.r.u.s.t.r.a.t.i.n.g.l.y noisy situation. So not only is ATTENU8™ effective, comfortable and durable - it will be at your corner when the time comes.  Delivering the peace you deserve The case for an aluminium bodyWith the aluminium body, it is easier to fit ATTENU8™ properly into the ear canal, offering better sound reduction. Other than an easier fit, an aluminium body helps in the following ways:1. Density: By using a denser material like aluminium, increases mass per unit area which then increases transmission loss. That being said, ATTENU8™ is still lightweight and comfortable.ATTENU8™ - as light as a paper clip2. Structure & rigidity between materials:By combining aluminium with a polyurethane (PU) foam tip, increases sound attenuation as PU is a good sound absorber. With this combination, sound energy is lost through different materials with varying densities. 3. Barrier against stubborn lower frequencies:Low-frequency sound waves are harder to absorb as it has longer wavelengths that reach greater distances; passing through without much vibration. Because of the mass and density of aluminium, the aluminium body is able to de-couple lower frequency sound waves before reaching the ear, offering more attenuation. Memory foam tip experimentWe conducted an experiment with 4 brands of foam tips: Brand I, Brand T, Brand M and our foam tips (Brand A) to test the durability of our foam tips.Experiment details ATTENU8™ and Brand M emerged at the top while the others disintegrated. Results here: Experiment results with hand sanitizerExperiment results with H2O*Please do not use any harsh chemicals to clean your ear plugs. The purpose of the experiment was to intentionally test the ear plugs with harsh conditions to test for durability. Do follow the care instructions provided. EfficacyATTENU8™ ear plugs have a rating of SNR32. To derive this rating, a test was conducted in an acoustic test chamber with specialised equipment. SNR rating aside, attaining the correct fit is crucial for optimal sound reduction. We decided to conduct 2 rounds of interviews with users across different age groups with varying needs. Round 1 of customer interviewsWe played a series of noise clips and asked participants to rate how effective ATTENU8™ and Brand M ear plugs were in reducing noise. They were also provided fitting instructions prior to fitting the ear plugs.Round 2 of customer interviewsA summary of the results: 92% of participants could NOT attain the proper fit with traditional foam ear plugs. Many struggled to insert them properly, citing it was ‘too soft and malleable'. When the foam ear plugs expanded within the ear canal, it occasionally caused the tips to ‘retract’ out of their ear canal.Traditional foam ear plugs fitted wrongly
On average, users rated ATTENU8™ 22% more effective than foam ear plugs.
In cases where users did not know how to fit the foam ear plugs, ratings varied with ATTENU8™ being up to 85% more effective than foam ear plugs.

Since then, we've had feedback + frequently asked questions from customers on some of the products sold and we wanted to address those gaps. We wouldn't call ourselves 'revolutionary' or 'game-changing', neither are we the 'world's first'. But it was important that we tried to close the gaps that our customers faced and make improvements to something as simple as a 'ear plug'.  ""Sometimes, little things make a big difference""- Nino Varsimashvili We didn't reinvent the wheel but rather, designed with intent - making the tweaks that matter. After which, it is crucial to follow through with educating our users on the importance on 'fit'. We have included step-by-step instructions, a fitting instruction demo video and an email address to address questions relating to 'fit'. It is the key ingredient to making ATTENU8™ a success and frankly, we know we cannot do it without you.We want to set the gold standard of ear plugs and more importantly, rid the notion that ear plugs are ‘uncool’ and encourage the use of hearing protection in our daily lives. This starts with encouraging the use of ear plugs and education on how to attain the correct fit to maximise sound attenuation.We believe in continuous reiteration to give our end users the ideal experience. After some concepts, prototypes, user testing and refinement, we created ATTENU8™. About The Founder  The team of advisors consists of entrepreneurs, designers and marketers who've worked together since 2020 to overcome painstaking obstacles to bring to life the vision of ATTENU8™. Bringing The Project To Life With: Importantly, we have a big team of product designers whom we’d like to thank - our research participants. Here’s a big, ‘THANK YOU!’ for being part of our journey.  We hope you see your feedback incorporated in some way or another. We raise our glasses and tips our hats off to you.###Effective, comfortable, durable ear plugs that are an easier fit and a better fix.

Another thing that goes over these bumps is the back end of your wrist. Yes, the wrist can bend more than 90 degrees backwards when pressed against a wall or desk—in my case, 105 degrees. This creates a chunk of skin and muscle on the back of the wrist tacked onto the bottom part of the hand.</p><p align=""left"">So logically, a traditionally designed watch worn at this position will collide with the bottom part of the back of the hand.</p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628018707/rmygdvsyurz8m3sfdsyb.png"" src=""""/></p><p align=""left"">(A watch with two crowns: one at 3 o'clock, one at 4.5 o'clock; both crowns are against the back of the hand so intensely, you can't even realize that there is a 3 o'clock crown.

Because you shouldn't pull the crown while you wear a watch on your wrist. This is because you might pull the crown at an angle and break the stem. Also, with the accuracy of modern wrist watches, you don't need to correct the time everyday.</p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628018744/tkq3hlo5hali1herk2fl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p align=""left"">This is a simple push-pull crown.

But, there is a big difference underneath the design process and in why both watches are off-centered.</p><p align=""left"">I would assume that the Mach 2000's off-center dial design is more to do with having these big eye-catching pushers. And the dial being left-sided is due to the exaggerated pushers restricting user's wrist movement restricted. So the off-centered dial is the result of a design choice of the pushers. (There are some LIP Mach 2000 models with centered dial and rectangular case with only one “ball,” which has a shorter crown stem and therefore the dial didn't have to move off the center.)</p><p align=""left"">My watch design is off-centered is solely because I wanted the wearer's wrist movement not to be interfered with the watch case and its crown. The left side of the case is round, because at first I wanted to make the case as small as possible; and the right side of the case is more square, because there was a need to attach the straps.</p><p align=""left""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628168190/qg9xymkbpczamis9yygu.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628018862/aixbirxgqsl0zzysureo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p align=""left"">The original reason behind the lowered rounded center of the dial is because I wanted the hour-indicating indexes to be placed inside of a cut-out.

But I designed this as the exhibition back with the mineral crystal, for two reasons.</p><ol>
<li>Some might refer to the simplicity of this watch as characteristic of  Nordic / Scandinavian design, Deutscher Werkbund, Bauhaus. These styles and movements have similarities in their simplicity born of the function and beauty emerging from the functionality.<br/><br/>NH36 (and its brother NH35) also bear these elements. It is not the lack of decoration nor the lack of an overly complicated mechanism, but the form created purely from its functions—from the pursuit of the efficiency. Also, the fact that NH35/36 is one of the most widely used automatic movements in the world tells much about this movement's superiority and beauty subjectively.<br/><br/>Those who only seek superficial beauty might not realize the true beauty in this movement. But microbrand enthusiasts and design enthusiasts would understand this beauty.<br/> </li>
<li>The NH36/NH35 movement is known for its affordability, sturdiness, trustworthiness, and beauty. No decoration, but otherwise seemingly impeccable design. But as far as I know, there is one weakness: its Magic Lever system. Seiko developed the Magic Lever so the movement can wind when the rotor moves in either direction. It's a clever system, using fewer parts compared to the Swiss competitors while keeping the cost of the movement low.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628019635/uj7subf6cshonhdo4zoy.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>(Image of another brand's watch, showing the NH35A's chipped transmission wheel)<br/><br/>The weakness is that the small teeth of the transmission wheel (which is a wheel pushed by the Magic Lever) tend to chip. While a few missing teeth don't cause any malfunction, when many teeth are chipped, it affects the winding efficiency.<br/><br/>By having the clear exhibition back, you can easily check the condition of the transmission wheel without opening the case back.</li>
</ol><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628019680/rylxl8fymqi2yjwwlbkm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p align=""left"">If you ever have to fix the movement, it will be much easier if the watch movement has no unique parts, such as an original engraved rotor. You can just pop out the movement by using a precision driver, remove the stem and hands, then put a new movement back in.</p><p align=""left"">The reasons for this crystal being mineral is that a case back faces less opportunity to be scratched, unlike the top crystal. And also a mineral crystal is more affordable compare to the scratch-resistant sapphire crystal, which is used on the A-1's top for protection.</p><p align=""left"">As for the reasons why this watch uses a mechanical movement, instead of a quartz one, are:</p><ol>
<li>That nice feeling that your movement is powering your watch</li>
<li>If you have many watches to wear, you don't have to change the battery</li>
<li>You don't have to change the battery every few years</li>
<li>There is no battery leak even if you forget about the existence of the watch and kept it in a drawer for a decade</li>
<li>It's fun to look at the exhibition back to see tiny parts moving</li>
<li>The comforting ticking sound when placing your hand near your ear</li>
<li>The sweeping second hand is nice to look at</li>
</ol><p align=""left"">So the reasons are more or less emotional-oriented rather than functionality.</p><p align=""left"">However, if there are enough people who would like to have this watch with a quartz movement, I would consider designing a quartz model (which would be designed anew, and surely thinner than the A-1 Automatic). </p><p align=""left""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628168267/nyubvdznbj8y0hcxisd2.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628019736/ozvfx0l3smdlxmenzega.png"" src=""""/></p><p align=""left"">I believe hands are one of the most difficult parts of the watch design.

<li align=""left"">My wrist measurement if 16.5 cm (6.49 inch) and the third smallest strap hole fits well.</li>

</ul><p align=""left"">(If you have wrist measurements greater than 19.8 cm / 7.79 inch, you can purchase an extra-long strap separately on shops such as <a href=""https://www.hirschstraps.com/collections/xtra-long-straps"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hirsch Straps</a>)</p><p align=""left"">The lugs of the watch are 20 mm, a very common width.

So there is no need to use any tool when removing or attaching the watch strap.</p><p align=""left"">This is one of the reasons I didn't produce any variant for the strap. If you are someone who would back a campaign like this, an unknown microbrand's crowdfunding campaign, there is a high probability that you already have several watches, and therefore several straps.</p><p align=""left"">So if you have your favorite pair of 20 mm straps, you can easily swap them. And if you haven't tried strap-swapping, believe me, it is fun—it gives a new look to the watch you know!

----UPDATE August 19th----A very influential blogger in Japan, Mr. Masaki Ishitani, has written about this campaign on his blog! (It's written in Japanese, but if you are interested, I would recommend you to read it using DeepL.com, it's like Google Translator but can produce much more natural AI translator!)日本の著名ブロガー、いしたにまさき様が当キャンペーンに関してブログ『みたいもん』にて記事を執筆してくださいました！どうもありがとうございます！----UPDATE August 18th----The most known watch reviewer in Finland, Ranteessa reviewed the prototypes models of the A-1 Automatic!Now, you might be unfamiliar with the Finnish language, but in the video you will be able to see prototypes of all models. So please check it out!--------------------A-1 is an automatic watch from a Finnish-Japanese design company AndoAndoAndo/AAA. Its founder is a Japanese designer Yu Ando.Who is this watch for?
People who love a good design
People who like a watch with style and practicality
People who want a comfortable watch that doesn't hurt the back of the hand
People with relatively small wrists


Original: Other than the movement and its discs, every part of the watch is uniquely designed.

Simple: No unnecessary decoration.

Small: 37 mm x 42 mm x 11 mm. Perfect for people who have a wrist size of 15 cm to 18.5 cm. Watch body weight 59.6 g (2.1 oz), straps 8.8 g (0.31 oz).

Ergonomic Design: The crown will never poke the back of your hand.

Unisex: But maybe not for people with big wrists.

Unique 2-Piece Case Design: Partially inspired by Étienne-Louis Boullée's architecture Cénotaphe à Newton (1784). Made with 316L Stainless Steel.

Time & Day-Date (EN/JP): All the necessary information on your wrist. Hands and hourly indexes lumed with SuperLuminova C1.

Seiko Instruments (SII) NH36A: One of the most trusted robust Japanese automatic movements available.

Sapphire Crystal: Scratch-resistant sapphire crystal is used for the top crystal to prevent scratches. Case-back crystal is a mineral crystal.

5 BAR Water Resistant: Enough to get through daily wetness, sweat, and tears. Just don't scuba-dive with it.

Limited Editions: Each color variant is limited to 100, each engraved with the serial number, so you can be proud of having a rare watch.

Also, as the combination of silver case and white dial is fairly common in wristwatches, this watch can pretend that it's not a special watch.*Lumed indexes will be white (Super Luminova C1) and crown will be changed in the production model. I was always interested in creating things and designing things. Although I have majored in a design-related field at university (Environmental Design), I've spent just over a decade in writing jobs (You can check my LinkedIn page for the details). At the same time, I got myself involved in several design-related projects, both in Japan and in Finland (though unfortunately not as a designer). But looking at great designs and how designers shaped their works firsthand, my passion for designing started to burn again.That was 3 years ago. I made a rough design for this watch (more details on its design process later on Details section), proceeded to build several prototypes, updated the design, and built more prototypes.Then finally, last year, I launched my own company: AndoAndoAndo, and decided to go into production.The first collection, ""A-1,"" was designed with the principle of simplicity, ergonomy, and functionality.

Simplicity: There should be no exaggerated decorations. The shape should be integrated with the function and the ergonomics.

Ergonomy: The crown should never hit the back of the hand. The watch should be able to tell time, while not covering up one's wrist even for a small wrist.

Functionality: It has to be entirely functional as a watch. It has to show the time, day and date.
 Here are some testimonials from the people who bought the 1st functional prototypes:Jyrki - ""I like your watch design a lot; stylish design, comfortable, quality in parts and size is proper, not too big or small.""Jaska - ""Was lucky to get an AndoAndoAndo watch among the first ones. What inspires me in this watch was the minimalistic design combined with the lightness. Every time you check the time you must feel a joy in the watch you carry in your wrist. Simplicity, lightness and accuracy. AAA design has fulfilled my desires in having a perfect timekeeper.""Petra - ""Beautiful, and practical. Fits to a small wrist.""Vauva Ando - ""Kello!"" (A watch!)I have already spent a lot of money and time on prototypes. But to complete the prototyping and mass-produce this watch, I need to meet the minimum order quantity (MoQ)—300 pcs—of the factory. To do that, I need more than € 44,000, and an advance payment of 30% of the production cost (which is around € 8,900) is needed.While I don't believe that I could raise € 44,000 in funding as the first time crowdfunding campaigner (without expensive promotional photos and videos), if I could gather at least € 8,900, or hopefully more, I could feel comfortable that there's enough potential in this design and begin the production. (How would I pay back the rest of the production cost? I will do my very best selling the manufactured watches.)Early Bird: € 196 Limited to 20Get one A-1 Automatic of your favorite color for 30% OFF the future retail price (€ 280)!€ 10 Shipping feeEstimated shipping time: December 2021 IGG Special Price - BBBB: € 224 IGG Special Price - BWBS: € 224IGG Special Price - WBSB: € 224IGG Special Price - WWBB: € 224Each limited to roughly 70 each.

So far, it's functioned with no problems, and I am confident that it would for at least the next 6 months.The reason I made sure that it's specifically 1-Year warranty for ""Manufacturing Defects"" is that I believe that most of the people who have never utilized the warranty of a product don't realize that the warranty only covers Manufacturing Defects. Some watch brands offer a longer warranty, such as 5 years or 10 years—but by then, how would you know that your broken watch suffered a manufacturing defect, or normal wear-and-tear? And would you ever be able to convince the brand's customer service that it was indeed a manufacturing defect?Their warranty doesn't cover wear-and-tear, or user error, and neither does this warranty. But I do think it is important to clarify that it is a warrant for manufacturing defects, instead of just issuing that it is a vaguely worded ""warranty"" which sounds like something that might cover something more than manufacturing defects. And 1 year is enough time to warrant manufacturing defects.60-Days 100% / 90% / 70% Return PolicyIf you wish to return the watch, you can absolutely do that within 60 days of purchase. You have to take several photographs of the watch and send an email to me before shipping it back.

But here comes the real explanations.If you don't like reading long texts, you don't have to read the below—you can go ahead and back the campaign right now!If you want to know about the design and the watch's details, before you back the campaign (or after you back the campaign), please go ahead and read through the long explanatory texts and the design sketches. :)(The design process of the watch case is messily shown in this picture. Isn't it refreshing to see actual design sketches rather than rendering-based, fake sketches on a campaign page?)It started from a simple round and a rectangular shape combined—from the left page's left top, to the final design on the right bottom.A watch movement is circular, and watch hands rotate. Plus, I wanted this watch to be small, so naturally, the dial should be round. But the placement of that round ""core"" part of the watch doesn't necessarily have to be in the center of the watch.Where should it be then? I designed the placement of the watch core on the left. But why left? Is this placement important? Why can't the watch core be in the center, like most of other watches? (A-1 Automatic's crown barely touches the back of wrist)It's because, this way, the watch will not prevent the wearer's wrist movement (if the watch is worn on the left wrist), and so neither the watch case nor its crown will not hit the back of the hand. To make sure the crown doesn't hit the back of the hand, the crown is placed on the dimple of the case.I make things a lot using my hands, I draw, sculpt, and design, while wearing a watch. Most of the watches I have used had one problem in common. The crown of the watch hits the back of my hand. This problem can be easily solved, by moving the watch core to the left side. But most of the watches available on the market today aren't designed that way, possibly so both left-handed and right-handed people can wear them.To me this seem like a flaw of the traditional wrist-watch design  (in which the case is wider than the strap width, and the crown is bumping out from one side of the case).If you are like me, wearing a watch not too loosely, and below your ""styloid processes of Radius and Ulna"" (the pointy part of the lower arm bones at your wrist), then the straps prevents the watch from sliding on to the wrist at these bones, while the watch is prevented from going the other way as this part is the thinnest part of the forearm.  (I understand there are other ways of wearing a watch, but I believe this is the most common way of wearing a watch.)(Other brand's watch, with its crown buried into back of hand)But while the strap stops at the bumpy part of the bones, the watch case and the crown will go over these bumpy bones. Another thing that goes over these bumps is the back end of your wrist. Yes, the wrist can bend more than 90 degrees backwards when pressed against a wall or desk—in my case, 105 degrees. This creates a chunk of skin and muscle on the back of the wrist tacked onto the bottom part of the hand.So logically, a traditionally designed watch worn at this position will collide with the bottom part of the back of the hand.(A watch with two crowns: one at 3 o'clock, one at 4.5 o'clock; both crowns are against the back of the hand so intensely, you can't even realize that there is a 3 o'clock crown. I don't want to climb a mountain with this one.)The same design flaw exists in watches with the crown placed at 4 o'clock position. If the designer claims that the 4 o'clock placement was intended to prevent the crown from poking the back of the hand, you should doubt it. Because that part of the back of the hand is highest when bent backwards.Besides, the placement of the crown at the right side of the watch (considering that the watch is designed to be worn on your left wrist) doesn't really make sense.Why? Because you shouldn't pull the crown while you wear a watch on your wrist. This is because you might pull the crown at an angle and break the stem. Also, with the accuracy of modern wrist watches, you don't need to correct the time everyday.This is a simple push-pull crown. With this design, a screw-in crown is overkill, as it only has 5 ATM water resistance, and the crown is already difficult to pull out accidentally.You can simply pull the crown after removing the watch from your wrist (and appreciate the movement and the case back while doing so), holding the crown from the top of the watch with your index finger and from the bottom with your thumb, and then safely pull the crown and change the time/date/day.You don't expect a professional diver to pull the screw-down crown while diving, right? Then why do most of the diver watches place the crown onto a place where it might hurt the divers during their missions? Do they have such a horrible movement inside that they have to adjust it every hour? Maybe the mysteries of the sea dwellers are deeper than I can imagine.(MAS Watches' The Irukandji solved the crown problem by providing four different placements for the crowns. At the same time, this allows both right-handed and left-handed people to enjoy the watch crown-poking free.)Oh, and the case is sandblasted so a small scratch won't be the focus of attention (which it often is if a watch case had polished finish). I sometimes get to be asked, ""Were you inspired by LIP Mach 2000 by Roger Tallon?""Indeed I knew the existence and the look of Mach 2000, so I cannot completely disregard the idea of my design's being inspired by it unconsciously. But, there is a big difference underneath the design process and in why both watches are off-centered.I would assume that the Mach 2000's off-center dial design is more to do with having these big eye-catching pushers. And the dial being left-sided is due to the exaggerated pushers restricting user's wrist movement restricted. So the off-centered dial is the result of a design choice of the pushers. (There are some LIP Mach 2000 models with centered dial and rectangular case with only one “ball,” which has a shorter crown stem and therefore the dial didn't have to move off the center.)My watch design is off-centered is solely because I wanted the wearer's wrist movement not to be interfered with the watch case and its crown. The left side of the case is round, because at first I wanted to make the case as small as possible; and the right side of the case is more square, because there was a need to attach the straps.The original reason behind the lowered rounded center of the dial is because I wanted the hour-indicating indexes to be placed inside of a cut-out. This was because I originally planned to make this watch by 3D printing, and hand paint or rather pour the lume (Stuart Semple's LIT) onto the index-cut-out.But if I just raise the dial to make enough space to pour the lume, at least on the very first 3D-printed prototypes, the hour hand touches the dial (mostly due to the minimum printable thickness restriction of the 3D printing service). So I lowered the center to make enough space for the hour hand to be able to move.The lowered rounded center has the same radius as the hour hand, and its round shape resonates with the ""bezel"" part of the case, as well as the inner edge of the bezel, which supports the sapphire crystal.There is also a subtle element you can see in the dial (A bit too subtle probably no one would notice nor care though).Usually below the crystal you will see the inside of the watch case, going directly below from the edge, or there might be a chapter ring making the dial surface smaller than the actual dial radius. But in this design the inner edge of the bezel supporting the crystal is overhung.(Above image: I designed this watch with Fusion 360)Meaning there is a 0.5 mm setback, which provides more space for the dial surface, 1 mm in total, compared to a traditional watch with the same crystal diameter. So the indices have more visibility, more sunlight can hit the lumed indexes, and the shadow from the overhang adds the additional depth in this seemingly simple small dial.This also means that you cannot see the surface of the dial in full from any angle, unless opening up the watch and taking the dial out.And of course this watch's dial and hands glow in the dark.Most of the photographs in this page are prototypes with SuperLuminova C3, but the production model would use SuperLuminova C1, which would look whiter when under the light, and slightly brighter when glowing.Rough dial surface makes the time easy to read, contrasting with the polished hands.I understand that some would prefer to have minute markers on the dial. But I believe adding each minute mark on this design was not necessary for this particular watch.To know the exact time might be important in some situations. But then you would probably have a quartz watch or an automatic watch with much higher precision. Considering that, and that the hour indexes can indicate the passage of time every 5 minutes, I decided that minute markers were not necessary for this watch.  Also it wouldn't be impossible to guess the right minute without the markers, by dividing the space between hourly indexes by 5.I would also like to mention that my grandfather was a very strict person, and he was never late for a meeting. He always told me to arrive at the location 5 minutes prior to your meeting. ;)If you look at the watch from the top, you can see that the rightmost part of the crown is at almost the same level as the case's rightmost edge. This way, the crown would not hurt the back of the hand, and it also it prevents the crown from being pulled out by mistake.Earlier functional prototype (above picture) had a crown with two sections separated by a gutter. Both sections had the gear-edge. The gutter is there so one could pull out the crown by pinching the gutter part with fingernails.The second functional prototype had a similar construction, but the outer section had no texture, while the inner section had the gear-edge. I thought that this way there was much less chance for things to be stuck on the crown, as the outermost section has no place for things (lints, etc) to stick on.I was right. A bit too spot-on right. The outer section was so smooth,  there would be no lint sticking, but it was also too difficult for my fingertips to rotate the crown.The final production would have the outer section gear-edged, and the inner section smoothed, like in the above sketch.The crown also has the AndoAndoAndo logo engraved on the crown top.If there are enough people—more than 200 to be specific—who would like to have A-1 Automatic for wearing on the right hand, I would produce it.(The case back engraving will change in the production model)I understand that some watch enthusiasts would prefer the case back covered, especially on a generic movement with no decoration, and I didn't even put an original rotor. But I designed this as the exhibition back with the mineral crystal, for two reasons.
Some might refer to the simplicity of this watch as characteristic of  Nordic / Scandinavian design, Deutscher Werkbund, Bauhaus. These styles and movements have similarities in their simplicity born of the function and beauty emerging from the functionality.NH36 (and its brother NH35) also bear these elements. It is not the lack of decoration nor the lack of an overly complicated mechanism, but the form created purely from its functions—from the pursuit of the efficiency. Also, the fact that NH35/36 is one of the most widely used automatic movements in the world tells much about this movement's superiority and beauty subjectively.Those who only seek superficial beauty might not realize the true beauty in this movement. But microbrand enthusiasts and design enthusiasts would understand this beauty. 
The NH36/NH35 movement is known for its affordability, sturdiness, trustworthiness, and beauty. No decoration, but otherwise seemingly impeccable design. But as far as I know, there is one weakness: its Magic Lever system. Seiko developed the Magic Lever so the movement can wind when the rotor moves in either direction. It's a clever system, using fewer parts compared to the Swiss competitors while keeping the cost of the movement low.(Image of another brand's watch, showing the NH35A's chipped transmission wheel)The weakness is that the small teeth of the transmission wheel (which is a wheel pushed by the Magic Lever) tend to chip. While a few missing teeth don't cause any malfunction, when many teeth are chipped, it affects the winding efficiency.By having the clear exhibition back, you can easily check the condition of the transmission wheel without opening the case back.
If you ever have to fix the movement, it will be much easier if the watch movement has no unique parts, such as an original engraved rotor. You can just pop out the movement by using a precision driver, remove the stem and hands, then put a new movement back in.The reasons for this crystal being mineral is that a case back faces less opportunity to be scratched, unlike the top crystal. And also a mineral crystal is more affordable compare to the scratch-resistant sapphire crystal, which is used on the A-1's top for protection.As for the reasons why this watch uses a mechanical movement, instead of a quartz one, are:
That nice feeling that your movement is powering your watch
If you have many watches to wear, you don't have to change the battery
You don't have to change the battery every few years
There is no battery leak even if you forget about the existence of the watch and kept it in a drawer for a decade
It's fun to look at the exhibition back to see tiny parts moving
The comforting ticking sound when placing your hand near your ear
The sweeping second hand is nice to look at
So the reasons are more or less emotional-oriented rather than functionality.However, if there are enough people who would like to have this watch with a quartz movement, I would consider designing a quartz model (which would be designed anew, and surely thinner than the A-1 Automatic). I believe hands are one of the most difficult parts of the watch design. If you pursue visibility, you might want to make it big so it would stand out in the dial, but at the same time big hands would obscure the dial too much.Also, the length of both hands is an important consideration when thinking about the readability of the time.I designed these hands to be straight hands with no decoration, and polished, so they would reflect light—and there is a contrast between the grainy dials diffusing the lights.(The first functional prototype having counter-balance on hands on left / The second prototype with no counter-balance on right)The production model will have no counter-balance. Often watch hands have a counter-balance part coming out from the opposite end. Although in some hand-design a counter-balance is necessary but at the same time it could be a distracting  element when checking the time.Adding the visibility to the hour and minute hands are SuperLuminova C1.The needle-thin second-hand is visibly different from both hour—and minute—hands, so it would be easy to check the time even at a very brief glance of the dial.The length of the strap is a very common one—the part with the buckle is 75 mm from one end of leather to the other end of leather, and the other half is 114 mm.Although the strap is in a common size, it would fit well on a small sized wrist compared to a ""men's"" wrist watch with an average case size, such as around 40 mm (and lug-to-lug is 45 mm). This is because the case size (from left to right) is 35 mm, and the lug-to-lug (a lug is the part where a strap is attached) is 42 mm.Also, a common strap has 8 strap holes, but this one has 9 holes. An extra sizing flexibility!Theoretically, a combination of this watch and its strap would allow a wrist measurement of 15.5 cm (6.1 inch) to 21.3 cm (8.38 inch). But probably the most comfortable measurement are 14.5 cm (5.7 inch) to 19.8 cm (7.79 inch).Here are some examples:
My wrist measurement if 16.5 cm (6.49 inch) and the third smallest strap hole fits well.
My wife has a wrist measurement of 15 cm (5.9 inch), and the smallest strap hole is slightly tight, and the second smallest strap hole is comfortably fitting.
(If you have wrist measurements greater than 19.8 cm / 7.79 inch, you can purchase an extra-long strap separately on shops such as Hirsch Straps)The lugs of the watch are 20 mm, a very common width. This means when you want to buy a new strap for this watch, you should chose the one that says ""20 mm"".The strap that come with the watch have a quick-release system. So there is no need to use any tool when removing or attaching the watch strap.This is one of the reasons I didn't produce any variant for the strap. If you are someone who would back a campaign like this, an unknown microbrand's crowdfunding campaign, there is a high probability that you already have several watches, and therefore several straps.So if you have your favorite pair of 20 mm straps, you can easily swap them. And if you haven't tried strap-swapping, believe me, it is fun—it gives a new look to the watch you know! If you don't have any other strap, companies like VARIO offer good selection of quality straps at affordable prices.One of the things I disliked about the traditional triangular shape of the strap-end is that the end part peeks at me (almost like a conehead hiding behind my wrist).I don't understand the reason the strap-end usually look like this.Because, if both straps are fixed to the lugs of the watch when placing the straps around your wrist, straps align naturally. While this pointy end design implies that it must be so difficult to put this part into the strap belt, it isn't.(This image is of a prototype strap; the product version will have an 11 mm shorter strap end, so you wouldn't see a squarehead like this if you wore it with the 4th-smallest strap hole.)So I designed the strap-end slightly shorter, and flat.The package of the watch is also as simple as the watch itself. I understand that a fun or luxurious unboxing experience could make a product more satisfying. But at the same time, an oversized box or overpacking is just a waste of materials, as well as it requiring more energy to manufacture, more fuel to deliver, and more space to store at your home.So the package I designed is minimalistic and environmentally friendly.Some might think it is risky to have a hole on the front, but considering that the scratch-resistant sapphire crystal is covered with a protective plastic sheet, I feel confident that the package would protect the watch during the shipment. AndoAndoAndo is a small family company. Consisting of two and a half Andos.Yu Ando - Founder and DesignerVaimo Ando -  Advisor ""This watch is heavy, do people buy this?""Vauva Ando - Durability TesterWhile I have a lot of experience as a backer of crowdfunding campaigns (I have backed more than 200 campaigns on Kickstarter, 28 on Indiegogo), this is my first campaign.It takes up to 15 days for Indiegogo to transfer the funds to my bank account. Then, the manufacturer says the production will take up to 55 days. The shipping to a facility in Finland takes up to 7 days, then packing, and shipping again to the backers might take another week or two.This means that the reward would arrive about 80 days after the campaign ends, and that's the fastest estimate.  So, it would take at least three months for the watches to arrive to you. But this is if everything goes smoothly. There might be some unpredictable natural disasters, or manufacturing or transportation problems.Considering that there is always the possibility of manufacturing delay, as well as shipping delays—especially now as many countries are facing the pandemic—it would be safe to assume that it might take 100 days or a bit more. Therefore the estimated shipping is set to December, but I hope it will arrive to your door much earlier than that!Either way, I will communicate with supporters of this campaign, and show the progress in each step. While there are always those risks, my experience of supporting 200+ fundraising campaigns would help me to get through these problems. I have seen many sad campaigns that just disappeared without a trace, leaving their backers without a word.But first of all, I will try my very best not to fail in this campaign, and secondly, even if this project faces some serious problems, I will reach out to the backers and tell you. I have invested my time, effort and money into this watch—I will not fail those who supported me.*Although I am from Japan and this watch indeed shares the Japanese soul with me, I will not do seppuku upon failing... Just so you know.If you are interested in this design, please spread the word!

Ours is one of engineering feats, defying gravity, and victory.When you see the Fleet of Apache-64s over the horizon, you know they are coming in guns blazing.The Apache has nothing to hide. The barebones dial looks at you head on with the same face as the attack helicopter, the sweeping tail is captured in the flexiglass plate — all captured inside the vibrant hardline case.What does it take to power such a machine? Just like the Attack Helicopter’s BulletProof T700 Turboshaft engine, the Apache utilizes a powerful 28,880vph mechanical movement for high accuracy.You need something that can keep up with you. While typical mechanical watches tap out of power in 2 days, the Apache holds an exceptional 80 hours of precise power in its reserve. Your timepiece is powered with your movement, no winding necessary.Milled from military grade 316L steel, you get impenetrable protection, Anti-Fingerprint Coating for a clean finish, and Sapphire Crystal Anti-Glare Lens so everything is crystal clear in any environment.Timeless Swiss Tritec RC Luminous hands keep the Apache illuminated for clear readings.How will you wear a piece of aviation history?Suit up with the Pilot Designed Leather Strap to look fly anywhere or take it to the next level with the IP treated scratch resistant stainless steel bracelet.All of Astronic’s straps are interchangeable with a quick release system.Be Bold. What will you take off in?It took decades to perfect the F-117 Stealth Fighter.It took centuries to perfect the Tourbillon.Now these two gravity defying legends come together in one luxurious timepiece, handcrafted for all who appreciate engineering marvels.Conquer the Skies and Time with Nighthawk by Astronic - the Gravity Defying Flying Tourbillon.When French-Swiss watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet created the Tourbillon 200 years ago, he created the most sophisticated mechanism ever seen in the watchmaking world.  Lockheed shook the world when the first jet designed for stealth defied radar and changed the skies forever.  Now you can bring home the first gravity defying flying tourbillon designed with the same sophistication as the legacies before it.  Astronic developed it’s custom in-house 3D co-axial flying Tourbillon to defy gravity just like the Stealth Fighter did in 1983. Using over 20 years of experience in the Swiss watchmaking industry, we matched the power of the Stealth Fighter’s silent engine with our 21,600 vibrations per hour movement.  Some of the most high end tourbillons have around 40 intricate pieces. Astronic has pushed the limits of the craft with developing a more sophisticated tourbillon with more than 76 pieces weighing less than half a gram — on average, each precisely hand-finished piece weighs less than a tiny grain of sand!A timepiece like this requires the most delicate of care. Wind the Nighthawk’s mighty tourbillon manually once every 42 hours and monitor your power on the 240°  gauge taken right from the Nighthawk’s cockpit.Each case is precision milled one piece at a time from military-grade 316L stainless steel. The precise, streamlined edges of the case of the Nighthawk mimic the Stealth Fighter’s aggressive silhouette.Second only to diamond, nothing offers you protection and a clearer view better than Sapphire Crystal. Wear a lens so translucent you can almost reach through and capture the Stealth Fighter soaring through the sky.  With its special anti-reflection coating, no glare or scratches can come between you and your timepiece.The Stealth Fighter is the first jet to defy radar, setting the new standard for stealth and clean escapes.  Stay clear from dirt and smudges with Astronic’s multi-layer Anti-Fingerprint Coating that keeps your timepiece’s pristine shine. Swiss Tritec RC Luminous hands light up in the dark so you can see all.Your ultimate timepiece needs to last. Astronic Steel Bracelets are IP-plated by the latest in vacuum ion plating technology. Leaving your wrist scratch resistant and safe from allergic reactions other metals can cause.  The Pilot Design Leather Straps come with a special pilot trim to perfectly compliment your timepiece.  Want to switch straps?

Now. it's time to say goodbye to the old days!    LinkLens uses an innovative technology called Open Air Audio that keeps you immersed in your music without shutting out the world. The sound ports are designed with an intentional space in front of the ears to allow in a small amount of environmental sound that keeps you aware of your surroundings. Unlike other in-ear headphones, this system puts no pressure on the ears, is helmet and hat compatible, and provides comfortable performance for all-day use.    LinkLens was created to elevate your audio experience and add a soundtrack to your adventures. With custom-built speakers and a specially engineered dual-chamber acoustic cavity that maintains separation of mids & highs in the front and rich, powerful bass in the back, LinkLens rocks your world. The embedded Bluetooth chip solution powers the audio processing for premium audio performance, along with battery life optimization and extension.   Always missing calls when fully enjoy the skiing? Not a problem for LinkLens! No need to remove your gloves or stop skiing, LinkLens allows you to answer or decline a call with just a single press and stay connected even while in motion! Fully enjoy your journey and never miss out on your calls!   Winter weather and snow sports present special challenges for gear. LinkLens has a unique Dual-mic Noise Cancellation that helps you hear clearly in windy conditions.  The integrated dual-microphone is aligned with your mouth (triple-points-in-line design) to screen out wind noise and ensure clear and crisp sound for calls and voice commands.   Ask your voice assistant (Siri, Google Voice or any other built-in voice assistant) for helpful information such as weather, set a reminder, or play music hands-free. LinkLens keeps you connected and in-touch anytime you need it.  For times when you need to better hear what is happening around you for safety, LinkLens has a special Single Ear Mode that lets you remain alert to your surroundings all the time or speak with someone nearby and hear them clearly without interrupting your audio experience. LinkLens features a quick one-button press that is gloves and mitten friendly for convenience, you can easily switch to Left/Right-ear mode to talk with others, or loop back to resume your adventure!   Featuring a large spherical lens (184.8mm*73.2 mm), LinkLens provides a wider unobstructed & crystal clear view with a super-wide horizon. Enjoy the scenery with a 170° horizontal FOV as well as a 90° FOV in the vertical plane. With LinkLens you see more and avoid unexpected conditions.  Nothing is worse than trying to see through a set of steamed up goggles. LinkLens utilizes a double-walled, anti-fog lens design for a clear, safe view even in humid conditions.     For any ski goggles, comfort and performance under varying conditions is essential. LinkLens gets the job done with an ultra-lightweight design and triple-layer high-density foam that perfectly forms to the face for all-day comfort. When things get heated, the anti-fog lens and sweatproof side fur help keep the view clear and wicks away moisture. LinkLens is built to go as far as you want.      LinkLens smart audio goggles feature with glove-friendly buttons to control your phone even wearing gloves or mitten. When pressing the buttons under the goggles, the vibration motor will vibrate and the built-in LED light will on for intuitive feedback even on the fly! *For more details, please refer to the user manual.   LinkLens can handle anything that comes its way, reliable operating in temps from -20℃ - 60℃. It delivers unparalleled music time for up to 21 hours and phone calling time for over 23 hours during your whole adventure. LinkLens automatically activates the low-consumption mode if the audio is stopped for a while, which enables it 186 standby hours. You will never worry about the low battery dilemma anytime!  LinkLens uses a uni-body design with IPX4 snow/waterproof that keeps out snow or water through your adventure, bringing immersive audio with a carefree experience!  With an eight-point magnetic layout on the goggle frame, you can switch your lens in a fast and easy way. No more hassles of setting up the lens on the slope!  Look as good as you feel and let your individual style show through. LinkLens is available in an Arctic Vision Series, you can choose from Aurora Blue, Arctic Silver and Sunrise Pink to fit your style to let you stand out from the crowd with an expanded view.    LinkLens provides 3 different day-time lens with different VLT (Visible Light Transmission) for different weather conditions.

<p>GripBeats® isn't just any ordinary musical instrument; it's wearable. And because it's wearable, it uses your hands' movements and touch to make music. Everything you thought you could do with an instrument before you can do now, but without it!</p>

<p>The term 'wearable technology' doesn't even scratch the surface. GripBeats® was made to be a fashion accessory as much as a musical instrument. Take it anywhere, enjoy it anywhere.  </p>

<p>At GripBeats® we wanted to make something versatile and that meant not needing to have to continuously put it back and take it out of your bag every time you wanted to use it. The rotational strap design allows you to wear GripBeats® as a standalone bracelet, otherwise called 'Wrist Mode'. When extended to fit around the palm of your hand in a double loop fashion, 'Grip Mode', GripBeats® allows the full interactivity and sensitivity of your fingers' and palms' touch as well as your wrists' motion. Finally, 'Surface Mode' is your traditional piano or drum pad layout that allows you to play flat out on any surface. A fourth option allows you to use GripBeats® however you want! </p>

<p>GripBeats® is tri-functional as i) an everyday bracelet (with a unique, slick, spiral design) in ""Wrist Mode"", ii) an extendable Grip controller for the hand in ""Grip Mode"" and iii) a drum pad or surface-piano device in ""Surface Mode"". </p>

<p>If you've ever tapped a rhythm, waved your hand or bopped your head to music then you're halfway to making music - you just didn't know it! GripBeats® allows you to transform these movements and gestures into music that you now can control and understand. </p>

<p>Yes! Not only can you use GripBeats® but you can dive straight into some of the more advanced ways of using GripBeats®. Since you already know about making melodies, chords and rhythms, how about you design your own movements for controlling these? Better yet, why not add some levels of intricacy so that perhaps: the faster you accelerate your hand, the more complex your rhythms are, or by squeezing multiple fingers each one triggers a different interval of the chord you're playing, or even by reaching out in front of you at different angles you activate a preset series of melodic patterns? The possibilities really are endless as we continue to expand in-app features and work with musicians to best simulate their ideal music experience.</p>

<p>Tapping on your body, the air or a surface has never been so underrated! Now you've got yourself a virtual music controller for translating these body drum techniques into actual drum sounds! </p>

<p>Wondering how much freedom the GripBeats® motion sensors have to offer? The answer is a 9-axis motion sensor that gives you a full 360 degrees of movement in every direction as well as detects how fast you're going. </p>
<div data-id=""27082726""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1575311337/gsmryyfjdk8jahx2i3qk.jpg"" src=""""/></p></figure></div>

<p>Wondering if GripBeats® is too advance for your kids? It's not! GripBeats® is intuitive enough for even the simplest entry-level musician, even if that means just tapping on 1 of 32 individual pressure sensors to make different sounds before gradually learning more complex functions such as chords and motion control.</p>

<p>GripBeats® is about making music through movement hence it's all about personal expression. If you're a dancer, now you have the perfect opportunity to finally translate your dance language into music. How, you say? Well, that's up to you! (see The Art of Making Music below).</p>

<p>The Art of Making Music through Movement and Touch didn't just come about overnight. GripBeats®' library of configurations of gestures-to-music combined with the added haptic feedback of the technical components are the culmination of over three years of creative genius and inspiration by some of the finest musicians.</p>

<p>GripBeats® originally began in London but as David sought out other markets and research expertise, soon hired developers from the US, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China. This diversity in culture, skillset, and access to some of the most extensive networks provided GripBeats® with the opportunity to take its product from concept to an actual viable and tested product in less than 18 months. Between us, we share cutting edge knowledge in the development of hardware, software, logistics, design and experience running our own businesses in the past. Of course, we all love making music too!</p>

<p>We're launching GripBeats® on Indiegogo because we love what we're doing. It also brings us great pleasure to see so many people empowered by finally being able to make music, even if it's through the most simple of controls. To innovate an industry that has used more or less the same musical instruments for centuries is mind-blowing for us and our current users, and we want to share this realization with the rest of the world. We look forward to launching GripBeats® and the list of future products we already have lined up to show. By joining us now you're not simply buying your first GripBeats® and catalyzing a new era of music creativity, you'll be joining us on our journey of continuing to innovate the world of music-creativity and revealing the talents people didn't even realize they had! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After raising $178,284 on Kickstarter we decided on continuing our crowdfund here on Indiegogo.</p>

Use GripBeats® in multiple ways; as an extended controller for each hand, the wrist, or even on a flat surface.
Our patent-pending adaptable multi-instrument design makes use of 3-dimensional space, acceleration, and direction for making music.
Make use of your hands' motion and touch contrsols with over 100s of apps like Garageband or Ableton using BLE MIDI (100% wireless).
The GripBeats® App (iOS/Android) allows growing gestures-to-music configurations and lessons on how to play music virtually, through movement.
Design new instruments and configurations for making music in your own way as well as with over a dozen preconfigured modes in the GripBeats® App.
A collaboration of designers and engineers by musicians from the Royal Academy of Music in London and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

GripBeats® isn't just any ordinary musical instrument; it's wearable. And because it's wearable, it uses your hands' movements and touch to make music. Everything you thought you could do with an instrument before you can do now, but without it!


The term 'wearable technology' doesn't even scratch the surface. GripBeats® was made to be a fashion accessory as much as a musical instrument. Take it anywhere, enjoy it anywhere.  


At GripBeats® we wanted to make something versatile and that meant not needing to have to continuously put it back and take it out of your bag every time you wanted to use it. The rotational strap design allows you to wear GripBeats® as a standalone bracelet, otherwise called 'Wrist Mode'. When extended to fit around the palm of your hand in a double loop fashion, 'Grip Mode', GripBeats® allows the full interactivity and sensitivity of your fingers' and palms' touch as well as your wrists' motion. Finally, 'Surface Mode' is your traditional piano or drum pad layout that allows you to play flat out on any surface. A fourth option allows you to use GripBeats® however you want! 



GripBeats® is tri-functional as i) an everyday bracelet (with a unique, slick, spiral design) in ""Wrist Mode"", ii) an extendable Grip controller for the hand in ""Grip Mode"" and iii) a drum pad or surface-piano device in ""Surface Mode"". 


If you've ever tapped a rhythm, waved your hand or bopped your head to music then you're halfway to making music - you just didn't know it! GripBeats® allows you to transform these movements and gestures into music that you now can control and understand. 


Yes! Not only can you use GripBeats® but you can dive straight into some of the more advanced ways of using GripBeats®. Since you already know about making melodies, chords and rhythms, how about you design your own movements for controlling these? Better yet, why not add some levels of intricacy so that perhaps: the faster you accelerate your hand, the more complex your rhythms are, or by squeezing multiple fingers each one triggers a different interval of the chord you're playing, or even by reaching out in front of you at different angles you activate a preset series of melodic patterns? The possibilities really are endless as we continue to expand in-app features and work with musicians to best simulate their ideal music experience.

Play with a friend or as many as 4 GripBeats® users all connected to one or more GripBeats® App devices.  Play in your own style and musical instrument. Jam wirelessly on separate devices, save and share what you create.



Tapping on your body, the air or a surface has never been so underrated! Now you've got yourself a virtual music controller for translating these body drum techniques into actual drum sounds! 


Wondering how much freedom the GripBeats® motion sensors have to offer? The answer is a 9-axis motion sensor that gives you a full 360 degrees of movement in every direction as well as detects how fast you're going. 


Wondering if GripBeats® is too advance for your kids? It's not! GripBeats® is intuitive enough for even the simplest entry-level musician, even if that means just tapping on 1 of 32 individual pressure sensors to make different sounds before gradually learning more complex functions such as chords and motion control.


Virtual drums!? That's right! In fact, ever since we could detect motion and acceleration, it was a simple process to configure these specific movements to actual drum sounds. 

 

Multiple modes mean you might enjoy playing beats in Grip Mode while your buddy plays synths in Surface Mode. This versatility allows you and your friends to simulate the feel and sounds of every instrument to make an actual soundtrack together, or by yourself.


 



 

 




 



 


 
Connect GripBeats® to your favorite DAW such as Ableton, Logic, Garageband or 100s of other MIDI-compatible apps all over Bluetooth MIDI. 


GripBeats® is about making music through movement hence it's all about personal expression. If you're a dancer, now you have the perfect opportunity to finally translate your dance language into music. How, you say? Well, that's up to you! (see The Art of Making Music below).





The Art of Making Music through Movement and Touch didn't just come about overnight. GripBeats®' library of configurations of gestures-to-music combined with the added haptic feedback of the technical components are the culmination of over three years of creative genius and inspiration by some of the finest musicians.


 


The GripBeats® App - once a concept, now a reality.

The GripBeats® App combines the fundamental controls of a DAW with all its commands specially designed for control over by using GripBeats®' motion and touch. The in-app sequencer allows recording and looping of 3 tracks in its simplest mode with the option to overwrite, adjust and post-produce in live and rested sessions.  



A quick-release mechanism means you can quickly and effortlessly detach and reattach GripBeats® whenever you want.
An LED ring that encompasses the core allows for visual feedback during music-making, adding to the performing and learning experience. 
A vibration motor will be embedded (since we soared past our $20K stretch goal) now providing additional haptic feedback but through feeling your music! 
GripBeats® is compact, portable, rechargeable and best of all, is customized by you.



We designed and developed our own electronics in-house. In turn, this has helped us reduce development costs which instead have been invested in the more innovative parts of development for e.g. the Art of Making Music through Movement and Touch. 

The PCB casing is robust yet can be rotated to fit whichever orientation or position that your playing mode requires. 

We couldn't find the right size and length of sensors to fit on our 32 sensor strip so we made our own. Each black sensor square has its own sensitivity range of at least 0-100.


Although bulky at the core, our old designs were our first examples of what GripBeats® was capable of. Other than functionality, we validated a range of colors, mechanisms, and designs to best suit users' needs in comfort, ergonomy, and fit. 
 


Our ultimate design for GripBeats® saw a size reduction of the core by over 250%, along with a substantially more streamline strip and user-friendly wrist attachment. You'll notice the integrated semi-transparent screen with embedded LEDs and (now that we met the $20K stretch goal) a vibration motor for motion feedback. 


 


 






 



 

 

The GripBeats® team boasts experience and communication within the hub of the world's majority supply of electronic components and hardware. The expected delivery/shipping times for Christmas 2020 are modest but are put in place in lieu of whatever slight delays we have prepared for. 

 



 

Wondering how you can use GripBeats® to play with a friend? One example is this: player 1 plays a chord progression which he changes through rotation while player 2 improvises using a scale of that key.
 




GripBeats® was invited to give a pitch at the IVS Convention in Japan in July 2019. Watch the full video @grip_beats on Instagram. They loved it!


GripBeats® originally began in London but as David sought out other markets and research expertise, soon hired developers from the US, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China. This diversity in culture, skillset, and access to some of the most extensive networks provided GripBeats® with the opportunity to take its product from concept to an actual viable and tested product in less than 18 months. Between us, we share cutting edge knowledge in the development of hardware, software, logistics, design and experience running our own businesses in the past. Of course, we all love making music too!


A CrowdOX survey will be sent out to all backers on a regular basis beginning in February 2020 where backers may choose which color they'd like their GripBeats® to be in.





 
We're launching GripBeats® on Indiegogo because we love what we're doing. It also brings us great pleasure to see so many people empowered by finally being able to make music, even if it's through the most simple of controls. To innovate an industry that has used more or less the same musical instruments for centuries is mind-blowing for us and our current users, and we want to share this realization with the rest of the world. We look forward to launching GripBeats® and the list of future products we already have lined up to show. By joining us now you're not simply buying your first GripBeats® and catalyzing a new era of music creativity, you'll be joining us on our journey of continuing to innovate the world of music-creativity and revealing the talents people didn't even realize they had! 
 
After raising $178,284 on Kickstarter we decided on continuing our crowdfund here on Indiegogo.

<h2>Become The One Behind The Mask</h2>
<p>You know that feeling when you put sunglasses on? When no one can see where you’re looking?</p>
<p>Whether you are saving the world, delivering packages, out shopping, on your commute, partying with your friends, going on a blind date, you can be certain that all eyes are on the mask, not your face.</p>

<h2>USE CASES</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a solution to take style, privacy to new heights, Blanc Mask is tailored to you! As technology continues to improve, the way we equip ourselves for the day to day should improve as well.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610747372/zuvm23p6xbdsjkc4zk4p.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>Full-Facial Protection 24/7</h2>
<p>Are regular masks just not cutting it for you? Changing them every 4 hours? Constantly buying new ones?<br/><br/>This may be an adequate short-term solution, but when you start adding up the cost of wearing disposable masks every day, changing them 4 times a day as recommended… you’ll end up spending over $500 a year!<br/><br/>Blanc is the<strong> full-facial protection</strong> you can wear and forget about. There’s no danger of touching your face, or of the mask’s HEPA filters wearing out over the course of the day.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610747429/cugdzo1quun0tgh2hqqj.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>Walk Around In A Bubble Of Fresh Air</h2>
<p>High-Efficiency Particulate Air filters have been used for years to clean and purify the air in interior spaces. From bedrooms to factory floors, indoor air quality is assured through these durable filters.<br/><br/>Now, Blanc brings that same high indoor air quality to your face. The SGS-tested HEPA filters trap all particles, creating a safe breathing environment around your nose, eyes and mouth.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>180-Degree Airtight Seal</h2>
<p>Everyone knows they need to be wearing masks. But it’s hard to argue their effectiveness when you see their flimsy material and poor fit. The huge gaps around the edges let a stream of unfiltered air in every time you breathe.<br/><br/>Blanc isn’t just a piece of cloth loosely draped across your mouth. Blanc mask is designed to ergonomically fit against your face, creating an airtight enclosure, and only feeding you air filtered through its high-efficiency HEPA filters.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610747502/voyhu6giprb5m0qg16jb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>All-Day Comfort</h2>
<p>Regular masks’ thin straps dig into your skin, and are constantly slipping down, making you touch them and reposition them — a big no no according to the authorities!<br/><br/>With Blanc, there’s no need for readjustments throughout the day. The interior chamber of Blanc is crafted to <strong>ergonomically adjust to your face</strong>. And its super-comfortable wide headband perfectly locks the mask in place, without stretching your ears or squeezing your head.<br/><br/>Whether you are taking a subway to work, on a long flight, or going out to a cyber-punk underground party with friends — regardless of what you’re doing, you can rest assured that Blanc is kept firmly in place.</p>

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>

In case we have delays for whatever reason, we'll immediately update you on it.</p>

Its modular design allows you to customize your own Blanc to your style and break free from the mundane.*Add-on module voice modulation will be released shortly after the campaign, and will be fully functional with your Kickstarter Blanc mask.**Add-on modules climate control and Bluetooth will be released shortly after the campaign, and will be fully functional with your Kickstarter Blanc mask.***. Guaranteed delivery by Blanc: the only full face modular maskWhy Now...?We survived 2020, everything is permissible now. You do not have to wait anymore to dress however you want, wear a futuristic mask, live the cyberpunk dream! Before you know it everyone will be rocking their own cool mask.Protection in StyleBlanc is more than just a cool face mask. Thanks to its comfortable air-tight fit, every breath you take is filtered through an SGS-tested replaceable HEPA filter.Blanc also offers exhalation filters as an optional feature to purify and clean not only your inhales, but also your exhales, keeping the environment clean for those around you.Get to Know BlancWe've designed Blanc Mask with your privacy and your desire for individuality in mind. It is easy to wear, remove, and put away. Thanks to the perfect seal it stays securely in place, rests on your face comfortably, and forms a protective barrier around your face.Blanc is a high-quality accessory that offers you a comfortable breathing experience when worn. Each mask comes with a HEPA filter that delivers you clean and purified air for up to 14 days (on average).We all understand the benefits of wearing face masks, but not all masks are created equal. Regular masks offer a less-than-adequate fit, allowing air to spill through the gaps.So, how is Blanc different? HEPA filters, or high-efficiency particulate air filters, are a special form of mechanical air filters that force air through a multi-layered fine mesh of angled micro-fibers. This traps harmful particles such as pollen, pet dander, tobacco smoke, pollution and dust mites.For PR inquiries contact david@blancmasks.comBlanc disrupts the new normal in fashion and safety, with a mask that not only protects your health but sets you apart from the crowd.Express your creativity whether you are taking a walk in the park, sitting in front of your computer at the office, or enjoying your evening with friends at a club.
Never settle for the ordinary. With its interchangeable magnetic panels, you can easily customize your Blanc’s front panel with different materials, textures, and colors to express yourself.Put on your best look. Make every outfit count. This is your mask. This is you.
 
 
Become The One Behind The Mask
You know that feeling when you put sunglasses on? When no one can see where you’re looking?
Whether you are saving the world, delivering packages, out shopping, on your commute, partying with your friends, going on a blind date, you can be certain that all eyes are on the mask, not your face.
Regular masks only cover part of what matters, Blanc is not only a cool full face mask with a HEPA filter— It protects your identity.

 
We live in a world where surveillance cameras lurk on every street corner, in every office building, and now on every front door. With the advancement of facial recognition systems, protecting your identity is more important than ever. 
With Blanc’s full-facial opaque protection, you decide when, where, and with whom you share your personal facial information.
 


The anonymous hero. Or the secret villain. Everyone wants to know who the man behind the mask is. Be bold, shroud yourself in mystery, and show the world you don't follow the status quo.

 


 
USE CASES
If you are looking for a solution to take style, privacy to new heights, Blanc Mask is tailored to you! As technology continues to improve, the way we equip ourselves for the day to day should improve as well.

 
Full-Facial Protection 24/7
Are regular masks just not cutting it for you? Changing them every 4 hours? Constantly buying new ones?This may be an adequate short-term solution, but when you start adding up the cost of wearing disposable masks every day, changing them 4 times a day as recommended… you’ll end up spending over $500 a year!Blanc is the full-facial protection you can wear and forget about. There’s no danger of touching your face, or of the mask’s HEPA filters wearing out over the course of the day.

 
Walk Around In A Bubble Of Fresh Air
High-Efficiency Particulate Air filters have been used for years to clean and purify the air in interior spaces. From bedrooms to factory floors, indoor air quality is assured through these durable filters.Now, Blanc brings that same high indoor air quality to your face. The SGS-tested HEPA filters trap all particles, creating a safe breathing environment around your nose, eyes and mouth.
 
180-Degree Airtight Seal
Everyone knows they need to be wearing masks. But it’s hard to argue their effectiveness when you see their flimsy material and poor fit. The huge gaps around the edges let a stream of unfiltered air in every time you breathe.Blanc isn’t just a piece of cloth loosely draped across your mouth. Blanc mask is designed to ergonomically fit against your face, creating an airtight enclosure, and only feeding you air filtered through its high-efficiency HEPA filters.

 
All-Day Comfort
Regular masks’ thin straps dig into your skin, and are constantly slipping down, making you touch them and reposition them — a big no no according to the authorities!With Blanc, there’s no need for readjustments throughout the day. The interior chamber of Blanc is crafted to ergonomically adjust to your face. And its super-comfortable wide headband perfectly locks the mask in place, without stretching your ears or squeezing your head.Whether you are taking a subway to work, on a long flight, or going out to a cyber-punk underground party with friends — regardless of what you’re doing, you can rest assured that Blanc is kept firmly in place.

 
Unmask Blanc

To enjoy your Blanc mask, you need only these three accessories, that comes inside the box:

1x Blanc Mask (see #1)
2x Magnetic front panels of your choice (see #2)
1 Replaceable and reusable HEPA filter (see #3)

A Mask That Evolves With You
Wearing a mask shouldn’t be an annoyance. It should be a possibility!Blanc is here to revolutionize the way we see masks, opening the doors to practical and cool everyday add-ons that make your life easier and more fun.By open-sourcing aspects of Blanc’s design, we’re developing an ecosystem of mask upgrades, from voice modulators to Bluetooth headsets, HUDs and augmented reality systems. You will be able to upgrade your mask with Blanc’s add-ons in the near future.

For centuries, face masks have been used during parties to let the wearer have a little bit of fun without showing who they actually were. Blanc goes beyond that!You won't find anything like this in the world. Its full-face form covers your whole face and allows you to regain control of your visual identity, emotions, and expressions anywhere you have it on.Change the way you see the world. Change the way the world sees you.
 


Get to Know Blanc
We've designed Blanc Mask with your privacy and your desire for individuality in mind. It consists of two vertical symmetrical parts which fold together. Using a simple “face wash” gesture with the palms of your hands, you can lock the two sides of your mask together at the midline of your face.

Thanks to its ergonomic design, it easily adjusts to your anatomical features, making for a supremely comfortable fit.

That means getting rid of heavy, restrictive standard pants, and replacing them with one pant that's ultra-lightweight, supremely comfortable, extremely durable and styled for versatility. We built The Territory Pant to have your back(side) in every environment- work, travel, and play. Just Added!A do-it-all short tailored for everyday wear, engineered for any adventure. Ultra-light, ruggedly durable, and swim-ready. Go from beach to BBQ in style.Built from the same Future-Twill™ as our Territory Pant, the shorts feature flow-through mesh pockets, quick dry C6 finish, a hidden paracord drawstring, snap pocket closure, and  zippered EDC pocket. With a choice between an 8 or 10 inch inseam.We didn't stop there...With our laboratory-proven Cellbloc™ media shield option, the Territory Pants and Shorts shield you from cellphone radiation without interfering with reception or battery life.(Claim as an ADD-ON by increasing your pledge level by $19 for each Cellbloc™ or add on in survey at end of campaign ) 16 Essential Features. No Gimmicks. Future-Twill™ stretches to move with your body, for superior comfort and capability. A C6 environmentally friendly Durable Water Repellent finish keeps you clean and dry when you're on the move. Future-Twill™ fabric repels moisture. Your perspiration evaporates through the breathable fabric leaving your clothes smelling fresh even after vigorous activity.Coming in at 12 oz. the Territory Pant packs up smaller than a T-shirt. With more airline restrictions on baggage weight, it's more important than ever to cut weight and save space. Safely and discretely stow your essentials when you're on the move.  The optional Cellbloc™ media shield protects you from harmful cellphone radiation when carrying your mobile technology in any pocket. A modern, tailored fit through waist, seat, and thigh, with a mellow taper through the knee and leg opening. We know that men have butts too, so we created a form-factor taper that maintains a  flattering slim silhouette without flattening the goods. Classic 5-Pocket design for ultimate Versatility. 21st Century fabric technology meets the timeless style first debuted in 1901.As adventurers and designers, we asked ourselves, why does hiking and skiing gear always get the best of apparel innovation--making it stronger, lighter, dryer, and more comfortable for the long-haul?The Territory Pant is our dream of integrating cutting-edge outdoor fabric technology with the look, feel, and style of a pant you can truly wear everyday for pretty much any situation--on the trail, at a nice restaurant, around the office.  Available in...

Accuracy, reliability, beauty and brawn infuse the great locomotive and her sister timepiece. It's about much more than just getting there on time. It's about getting there in style. The Pramzius Gauge Master watches bring you both in one unexpectedly unique package.Hello everyone!My name is Craig Hester and I am the co-founder and chief designer at Pramzius watches. Our team wants you to know up front that The Pramzius watch company has successfully launched three previous watches on Kickstarter — The Trans Siberian pocket watch for the wrist, the Fall of the Berlin Wall watches, which have actual pieces of the Berlin Wall in the crown, and the Iron Wolf watches. See our website for details.That's me, Craig Hester (in the hoodie) with my friends at VVT in Switzerland So we have a history in watches you can trust! Reach out to any of the previous backers of our watches and they will tell you we not only delivered the watches we promised but most owners of our watches say we met their expectations and then some.The Gauge Master watches will be the same. Well-built, delivered and backed by our 2-year warranty. So pledge with confidence!  Click here to read the article in Steampunk Explorer  With genuine metal from 1800s and 1900s locomotives constructing the outer dial, put the Gauge Master watches on your wrist and bring the locomotive with you wherever you may roam. You'll feel the steam, hear the whistle and swear that ""all aboard"" is about to ring throughout the station.  Photo by Ty Alexander The watches' inner dial is inspired by a manometer gauge from one of the painstakingly restored engines run by the VVT train museum — Vapeur Val-de-Travers — of St-Sulpice Switzerland. As the museum's official timepiece, every aspect of the Gauge Master watches speak to a component of trains or train lore. The German heritage of a 150 ton beauty of an engine that took 15 years for the tireless volunteers of the VVT museum to restore — keeps the Pramzius watches connection to the Baltic along with a custom bund strap from Sweden.      From Wrist Game by Philip Dashiell       The Gauge Master brings together an eclectic mix of timekeeping elements to create watches that looks like nothing else out there. While inspired by the manometer gauge, the elements of the watches go far beyond a simple repeat of the gauge's appearance. Another signature element of the Gauge Master watches is the askew dial. Photo by Beau Hudspeth  - The WatchTographer This configuration, seen in other train watches (we didn't invent this wheel) is designed for engineers who use levers and pulleys rather than a steering wheel. This allows them to quickly glance at the time without having to move their wrist and risk inadvertently moving a lever in the process. We tested the watches and had shared them with more than one watch expert. The consensus is that, while it may take a little getting used to, in literally minutes you are reading the watches without any difficulty. The red twelve and the crown position help to orient the eye so you can tell the time with ease.  We look forward to hearing back from you about how easy the watch is to read once you get it on your wrist.  Photo by Beau Hudspeth - The WatchTographer The exterior screws on the watches case are reminiscent of the mounting screws of gauges in the locomotive's engine compartment. The sub-second hand of the watches is directly inspired by the valve control wheels also found in the engine compartments. Two of the executions of the watches come with fully luminous dials that will split the dark even on the foggiest of adventures. We use only Swiss Superluminova brand lume in 15 individual silk screen layers to truly split the dark. The tumbled stainless steel case offers a look as if the watches come directly from the past.    Photo by Ty Alexander Photo by Beau Hudspeth - The WatchTographer And the exhibition caseback highlights the mechanics of the watches and is historical inspirations. The logo of the VVT train museum is also proudly etched on the exhibition caseback of the watches, which displays the Miyota 82S5 sub second automatic movement, which powers the Gauge Master watches. The crystal is sapphire and the watches are rated to 10 ATM water resistance, which is unusual for train-related watches. We wanted the quality of construction that comes along with that level of water resistance. Put the Gauge Master on your wrist and step back in time. Metal holder for the movement inside the watch (as opposed to plastic).Quality you can't see but will be happy to know is there.   Check out our article in Steampunk Explorer! Wikipedia defines Steampunk as a retro-futuristic subgenre of science fiction that incorporates technology and aesthetic designs inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery.While we can’t argue with that definition, the fact that it is missing the words “so cool” means it doesn’t really capture steampunk to us.

The snaps at the bottom are always bulky, uncomfortable, and tend to unsnap at the most inconvenient times...and choosing options without snaps makes it difficult to use the bathroom. Not to mention most bodysuits are produced with cheap fabrics that make them feel thin and irritate the skin, too!We knew there had to be one suit that reflected ALL of our wants. We needed one basic that we’d never want to take off.    No matter what your day has in store, Wantsuit is perfect for any day-to-night look. It’s ultra-comfortable, functional, practical, and trendy.    Both Wantsuit styles are available with or without snaps!Our snaps are super slim and come in various lengths — you’ll barely be able to feel them. Plus, you’ll be able to adjust the snaps to perfectly fit your body. They can be adjusted to three different lengths: short, regular, and long!  No more awkward lines and uncomfortable layers — with Wantsuit, you can leave your undergarments behind.The Wantsuit features a built-in cotton panty liner and non-removable bra cups for extreme comfort, support, and versatility.  Wantsuit is designed to look and feel good, so we chose to craft the Wantsuit with high-quality Micro Modal fabric.This ultra-comfortable fabric is:
Stretchy so you can move freely.
Moisture-wicking, absorbent, and quick-drying.
Breathable to keep you cool.
Odor-resistant — no more worrying about sweat!
Wrinkle-free so you will always look put-together.
Our fabric also features a shimmer for an elevated look.   We utilize a laser-cutting technology for our fabric to achieve a smooth, clean finish and create a garment that’s so seamless you can wear it under any garment.Wantsuit is also tailored for maximum sculpting and smoothing, so you can always look and feel your best.  We wanted to create a garment that’s good for you, and for the planet. Every element of the Wantsuit ensures longevity — its timeless design and high-quality fabric make it the opposite of fast fashion.Micro Modal is a green fabric that is quick-drying and cuts down on water consumption. We opted for a simple, printed label to make Wantsuit tagless! Additionally, all of our packaging is 100% biodegradable.        As one of the first crowdfunding marketing agencies, Enventys Partners has brought more than 750 crowdfunding projects to life through lead generation, campaign page creation, public relations, email marketing, Facebook Advertising, campaign management and more.  Wantsuit is created by a woman for women. The first goal was comfort and functionality without compromising on style.Tekye Pettie Chong, the founder and the inventor of Wantsuit, was inspired to create the perfect bodysuit after struggling to find one that kept up with her busy lifestyle.She spent thousands of dollars in the pursuit of the perfect bodysuit.

<h2 align=""center""><strong>Introducing the new YES WorldWatch V7 with wireless induction charging.</strong></h2>
<p>After a lengthy process of development and testing the wireless charging system has proven flawless. Getting it manufactured is proving to be a financial challenge. </p>
<p>To put watches into production we need to raise an additional $10,000 plus quickly, and to that end we are re-opening our existing Indiegogo crowd funding campaign offering 5 unique perks at great pricing. </p>
<p>Just remember, this current fund raising tally started at $147,085. We’ll reach this new and expanded goal when hopefully we get to $157,085.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Building a business.</h2>
<p>In business since 1999, we set out to build a unique time piece that would connect the natural  cycles of the sun and the moon with the constant ticking of hours, minutes and seconds. You may ask why would we want to do that? Connecting the dots surely proved much more complex and intriguing than imagined, but the simple reason is that it helps to manage time with greater accuracy and timing in order to get the most out of it. Whether you are a slow going seeker or an extreme sports enthusiast it would be naive to think that the day and night, the sun and moon, has nothing to do with the experience. </p>
<p>Check out this interview. It is from a long time ago, but it  does cover some of the highlights on how we got started:  <strong> <a href=""http://www.yeswatch.com/pdf/2004-insync.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">An Interview with the Founder! </a></strong></p>

<p><i>          Hey Björn,</i></p>
<p><i>My World Watch has arrived.</i></p>
<p><i>I am really so impressed... the blue hand and silver case, the colors of the display- definitely the most beautiful watch you have ever made! Also love the ratcheted bezel ring, moveable in 12-minute steps. Of course I noticed that the serial number on the back plate is actually ONE. How cool is that? I feel very honored! </i></p>
<p><i>The WW is really such a big step forward, though it is essentially the EQ combined with advantages of the older versions. The solar and lunar rings, also the moon not visibly divided into segments- looks better, day/night division of the whole watch face. There are so many little things: the light stays on just a little bit longer, the alarm sound seems just a little bit louder, the buttons will not be activated involuntarily and most importantly: the hand is now thinner and the digits bigger, so the hand will no more interfere with readability. 13:00? 13:06? 13:08?</i></p>
<p><i>I would say this watch is really your masterpiece. Finally I found the watch I had dreamed of... and it did NOT cost 20,000 as expected. Thank you so much!</i></p>

Introducing the new YES WorldWatch V7 with wireless induction charging.
After a lengthy process of development and testing the wireless charging system has proven flawless. Getting it manufactured is proving to be a financial challenge. 
To put watches into production we need to raise an additional $10,000 plus quickly, and to that end we are re-opening our existing Indiegogo crowd funding campaign offering 5 unique perks at great pricing. 
Just remember, this current fund raising tally started at $147,085. We’ll reach this new and expanded goal when hopefully we get to $157,085.

A custom made charging bed, which will be made black in production, allows the watch to be charged with bracelet and straps attached to the watch. The battery icon in watch read charging level. On a full night of charging you’ll get about 3 months of battery life.

Many of us wear our YES watches with the digits turned off. To make the reading of time more accurate in this mode, we added the option to set the outer yellow dial to show 60 minutes. Combined with a 60 minutes bezel, it will give an accurate hour and minute read without turning on the digits.

The back plate will have a golden crystal that covers the interior charging coil. This solution will allow for a very speedy charging process and it will look much cooler than it does in this rendering

  Across the planet there are upwards of 20 different Daylight Saving Time systems. The WorldWatch incorporates all of them in the programming for the relevant cities and automatically adjusts for them. If need be, DST can also be turned ON and OFF manually. Check out this video to see what happens at the time of DST change.

 
In video clip below you can see how the WorldWatch switches time between your HOME and AWAY city.

 
This clip shows you how to set the WorldWatch to one of the 7 languages.

 
This video shows you how to set the outer yellow LCD ring to show times for either MOONRISE/MOONSET or SUNRISE/SUNSET for the alternate city.

In today’s world of over connecting the WorldWatch offers a fresh perspective on being completely independent. It doesn’t need a signal, it doesn’t need a phone, cannot be tracked and doesn’t need to be charged every day. It focuses solely on your time, like a personal time keeper that travels incognito.
 

 

 
Building a business.
In business since 1999, we set out to build a unique time piece that would connect the natural  cycles of the sun and the moon with the constant ticking of hours, minutes and seconds. You may ask why would we want to do that? Connecting the dots surely proved much more complex and intriguing than imagined, but the simple reason is that it helps to manage time with greater accuracy and timing in order to get the most out of it. Whether you are a slow going seeker or an extreme sports enthusiast it would be naive to think that the day and night, the sun and moon, has nothing to do with the experience. 
Check out this interview. It is from a long time ago, but it  does cover some of the highlights on how we got started:   An Interview with the Founder!

I came at the watch business as a total rookie, with an idea only, just wanted a watch that could tell me times for sunrise.  Couldn't be that hard, right? 20 years later I feel like a graduate whose wings have been carefully clipped. We couldn't have done it without the  caring involvement and expertise of our manufacturing partners. The WorldWatch V7 is the best timepiece we have ever put together.

Peterson, a dear friend, a bon vivant, angel investor, pilot, farmer and a loving dad sent me this video. He was one of the earliest adopters of the classic WorldWatch, almost 20 years ago. It made a most beautiful cameo in this video. California Flight

 
Karl is a true early adaptor, but not one of those who talks about it. So I will do it for him. He was the 4th to contribute to our EQ campaign and he bought the first WorldWatch V7 prototype off my hands just a couple of weeks ago. It arrived in Germany a few days ago and this is what he had to say:
          Hey Björn,
My World Watch has arrived.
I am really so impressed... the blue hand and silver case, the colors of the display- definitely the most beautiful watch you have ever made! Also love the ratcheted bezel ring, moveable in 12-minute steps. Of course I noticed that the serial number on the back plate is actually ONE. How cool is that? I feel very honored! 
The WW is really such a big step forward, though it is essentially the EQ combined with advantages of the older versions. The solar and lunar rings, also the moon not visibly divided into segments- looks better, day/night division of the whole watch face. There are so many little things: the light stays on just a little bit longer, the alarm sound seems just a little bit louder, the buttons will not be activated involuntarily and most importantly: the hand is now thinner and the digits bigger, so the hand will no more interfere with readability. 13:00? 13:06? 13:08?
I would say this watch is really your masterpiece. Finally I found the watch I had dreamed of... and it did NOT cost 20,000 as expected. Thank you so much!

While maintaining the popular ""¼-Inch (6mm) thinness"", the appearance has evolved with a leather material suitable for a wide range of situations. The innovative ""Hidden Pocket 2.0"" has been added for higher storage capacity. It is ½-Inch(12mm) thick while it can hold 8 cards, 10 bills, and 18 coins.We are on an affiliate program!https://tenuis3-leather-tl-the-thin.kickbooster... Tenuis3 Leather TL on Campfire crowdfunding in Japan.Raised more than US$200,000 from 2400 backers.https://camp-fire.jp/projects/view/413255 Tenuis3 (Canvas version) on Campfire crowdfunding in Japan.Raised more than US$400,000 from 4600 backers.https://camp-fire.jp/projects/view/185652 Thinness that doesn't change even if you put things inTenuis3 Leather TL is a thin wallet that is only ¼-Inch (6mm) thin. However, it's not just a thin wallet, it's a wallet that can be filled with cards and coins and still remain thin.In recent years, we have seen a lot of wallets with thin designs. However, a common problem with these thin wallets is that the wallet itself is thin, but when you actually put bills, coins, and cards in it, it becomes thick. Needless to say, the thinness of the wallet itself is important, but we think it is equally important to be able to keep it thin even when carrying things.Tenuis3 Leather TL we are introducing here is not only thin in material, but also incorporates a number of innovations that allow the wallet to remain thin in actual use.  Industry's thinnest class, 0.03-Inch (0.8mm) surface leatherIn producing an extremely thin wallet, it is important to use thin materials.The surface leather of Tenuis3 Leather TL is Toscano Liscio, a cowhide leather produced by the Italian company Conceria 800. Through the process of straining (shaving thick leather into thin layers), we have achieved a thickness of 0.03-Inch (0.8mm), which is just enough to maintain strength. It is one of the thinnest leather materials in the industry.We pursued not only thinness but also attractiveness as a leather material. The leather is processed using the traditional Italian vachetta oil method. The process of vegetable tanning takes time to soak into the leather, resulting in a very soft and supple leather material. This vachetta leather is soaked with plenty of oil, so you can enjoy the color and luster deepening with aging.The inside of Tenuis3 Leather TL is made of 0.019-Inch (0.5mm) goat leather. Goat leather is an unfamiliar material in Japan, but it is a leather material that is lightweight, durable, thin, and stretchable. It is also known for its fine and beautiful wrinkles called ""grain patterns"". The industry's first ""twin card pocket"" that thoroughly eliminates wasteThe card slots of Tenuis3 Leather TL are designed as ""twin card pockets"" for easy access and storage. The card pockets are arranged parallel to each other to distribute the thickness, making it easy to see and insert and remove cards. The size of the two card pockets is almost the same as that of the entire wallet, leaving no wasted space.The recommended storage capacity is four cards in each pocket, for a total of eight cards, which is sufficient for daily use. Since it is made of leather, it may feel tight at first to put about three cards in, but after a week or so, the elastic leather will become accustomed to it and you will be able to store them smoothly.Also, the twin card pockets are capable of keeping the overall thickness of the wallet even, so it won't get bumpy even if you have a lot of cards in it. This feature allows the wallet to maintain its smart appearance even after several years of use. A divider to eliminate uneven coin distributionEven if your wallet is thin, the coin pocket will bulge out as you use it. The coin pocket of Tenuis3 Leather TL is equipped with ""a divider"". Even if you carry coins in it, they are less likely to be unevenly distributed in one place and the thickness is distributed. The zipper is a ""thin zipper"" with few bumps. Not only is it thin but easy to use. Advanced ""Hidden Pocket 2.0"" for additional storage of cards and keysSince the release of our previous model, Tenuis3, we have been extremely grateful for feedback from our users. Among them, was a great demand for carrying more cards and valuables other than money. That’s why we greatly enhanced the functionality of the pockets inside the wallet, which were introduced as ""hidden pockets"" in the previous product. This time, a new pocket for card storage has been added, for a total of two pockets that can hold two cards. This means that together with the aforementioned number of twin card pockets (8 cards), a total of 10 cards can be stored. In addition, this advanced ""hidden pocket"" has four key pockets that can hold most common types of keys, allowing you to keep a spare key in your wallet in case of emergency. Available in 9 colorsThe bottom of each picture shows the approximate color change after about 6 months to a year of use.※The actual color and dying condition of the leather may change depending on a production lot.Jet BlackDark GreenIndigo BlueBright GreenVermilion RedGolden YellowSmog BrownRusty BrownOlive Brown New colors added on May 27th, 2021!Three brownish colors, which are standard for leather products, have been added. From left to right: Smog Brown, Olive Brown, Rusty BrownSmog Brown is a brownish color, but it is close to gray or black, and depending on the brightness and environment, it may not look brownish leaving a hint of coolness.Olive Brown is an olive-type color, but it is more yellow than green, and a calming color that is closer to brown, which may catch people's attention.Rusty Brown is a standard brown color, not too dark, not too light, but in the middle, which is probably the easiest color to imagine the leather changing over time. Specifications of Tenuis3 Leather TLMaterial:Cowhide leather, goat leather, polypropylene sheet (PP), rigid vinyl chloride sheet (PVC), thin zipper for walletsManufacturing:Cowhide leather: Tanned, traditional Italian vachetta oil processGoat leather: chrome tannedDimensions:Width 3.5-Inch (90mm) x Length 4.3-Inch (110mm) x Thickness 1/4-Inch(6mm) (when not stored)　Weight:Approx. 50g (1.76oz)Storage (recommended capacity):8 cards + 2 cards (8 twin card pockets, one in each hidden pocket), up to 10 bills, 15 coins, up to 4 keys, small items, etc.Approx. 0.47-Inch (12mm) thick when holding 8 cards + 10 bills + 18 coinsTenuis3 Leather TL is a thin wallet, but it does not strictly limit the amount of contents.

After the campaign is over, we are planning to sell it for $118, which is lower than the average price of similar products from other manufacturers. The reason for this is that we do most of the operations in the development stage, such as prototyping and sample making, directly with overseas factories without any intermediaries, and do not go through unnecessary intermediaries when we sell our products to the public after the crowdfunding campaign is over. Basically, we take a direct business-to-consumer approach. This is how the lower costs are realized.In addition, we procure all materials directly from the manufacturers in each country. This also prevents unnecessary middlemen from raising costs and prices.Because SOLAHANPU began with the concept of a travel enthusiast, we have the advantage of being able to work as a team using our experiences and languages learned from around the world.In addition to product design, we also aim to keep prices and profits minimal. Not only do we aim for minimalism in terms of price and profit., we will continue to make products that are sustainable. Tenuis3 Leather TL has been featured.

With its extra-wide curved display, the Amazfit X fits more of the important stuff on your wrist, without all the scrolling to find it. It applies the continuous heart rate monitoring system to help reach your fitness goals and monitor your health effectively, wherever your day takes you. And with a lithium battery that can run for 7 days on a single charge, the Amazfit X has the power to get you through your whole week worry-free. Even when you’re living around-the-clock.Move more. Stressless. Monitor your health. And go all week on a single charge. The Amazfit X has all the right curves to keep you comfortable, and all the right data to keep you motivated. All on a large color-rich display.The new standard in smartwatches has arrived.  Intricate in its design, Amazfit X exemplifies the clarity with a 326 PPI HD resolution and enhances its expression through a 400 NIT high-brightness display. Enjoy sharp and bright display even under direct light with Amazfit X.The Amazfit X is all curves, so it fits your wrist whether you’re shaking hands in the boardroom or crushing goals in the gym. It’s designed with a 92° curvature that helps the Amazfit X rest comfortably on your wrist. Falling asleep wearing the Amazfit X is no problem — with all these curves, it’s designed with “Do Not Disturb” in mind.How do we get that perfect curve?The Amazfit X was made with a level of precision you’d expect from a finely crafted watch. First, our engineers heat the glass cover to over 700°C. Then they use a 6-step bending process until the Amazfit X reaches a 92° super arc that wraps comfortably around your wrist. Even the 7-day lithium battery is curved for your comfort.How many brands are willing to go this far for your comfort? Your time is valuable, so why waste it scrolling through endless menus? The Amazfit X shows you more of what you need in a single glance, as it surpasses a 6% display area of the smartwatch industry leader. With a color-rich 2.07” curved display, the Amazfit X fits more on your wrist than most smartwatches. That means more room for apps to track your health and organize your day. And less time spent scrolling to find what you need. Additionally, a titanium alloy uni-body makes the watch extremely lightweight and the design super sleek. Your phone is button-free, so why not your watch? More of our devices are ditching bulky buttons for a more integrated approach. The Amazfit X features a minimalistic design that does away with buttons and crowns that can dig on your wrist. Instead, this watch stays sleek with a pressure-sensitive sensor that helps you access everything with a press of your finger. So much more battery life. And so much less to worry about.With the Amazfit X, our engineers wanted to deliver a full 7-day battery life without sacrificing features like professional level heart rate monitoring, round the clock text and call notifications, and tracking for your weekly workouts.The challenge? It takes a lot to power a watch this smart and packed with features.So our engineers actually came up with the idea of curving the high-powered lithium battery. It allows them to fit more battery power into the Amazfit X, all while maintaining its futuristic curved design. No fuzz, at your convenience. Charging has never been easier with an utterly effortless experience.Heading out of town? Leave your charger and your worries at home. Amazfit X gives you plenty more run-time than other smartwatches. So it will keep going while you’re out conquering the business world. Or off conquering the beach.All-day. Everyday. 7 days a week.We gave you the best smartwatch battery performance we could. Because… well, why wouldn’t we?  Amazfit X always has your heart in mind. It monitors your heart rate 24 hours a day, continuously and uninterruptedly, for a more comprehensive fitness data on a glance.The result: the Amazfit X is setting a new standard for heart rate monitoring in smartwatches. Amazfit X keeps an eye on your cardiovascular health and your fitness with a bigger sensor. Effectively. Remotely. Even when you’re pushing for that extra mile. Find your way around all life’s corners. With the Amazfit X, you’ve got two of the world’s top Geo-tracking systems on your side: GPS and GLONASS.That means if one system has trouble finding you, the other one will jump in to help. So you can have peace of mind even when you travel abroad, knowing you’ve got both satellite systems lighting your way.Sticking closer to home? Track your running course, speed, and distance in real-time with spot-on accuracy. And no more chasing your location as it drunkenly floats across the screen when the signal gets weak.The Amazfit X will give you pinpoint accuracy even on your most unfamiliar routes. So you can run further than ever. With Confidence. Get the most out of every workout. Whether you’re open water swimming or cycling in the gym, the Amazfit X will track your progress and help you reach your fitness goals. With 9 versatile sports modes, it offers customizable tracking and coaching for every activity. It’s the coach on your wrist giving you the stats and the motivation you need to level up. Take your Amazfit X in the pool without worry. Or play at the beach till sunset without losing track of the time. With water resistance up to 50 meters, this watch will help push you through your laps and improve your personal best time.*Remember to remove the Amazfit X before you hit the shower or a trip to the sauna, since all that steam can affect the seal and make it less water-resistant next time.  A 100-point scoring system to make healthier living simple and fun. The better you move, the higher your score. Count your steps each day. Measure your calories. Get reminders when you’re sitting too much. And let the Amazfit X nudge you towards a higher score for your health.Amazfit X uses big data to know the leading predictors of longevity and good health. Its *Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) gives you easy to understand assessments, helping you set and then crush your fitness goals. Over time the Amazfit X can help you raise your score, helping you create a healthier, more active life.And the large 2.07-inch AMOLED screen lets you get a quick read on your heart rate and activity levels all in one glance, without scrolling. Because your health deserves to be front and center. Your blood cells need the right balance of oxygen to keep you healthy. And to keep your mind sharp and alert. The Amazfit X uses an infrared light test to measure your *blood oxygen levels without pricking fingers. Your day started last night. The Amazfit X can help you get the most out of your day with a great night’s sleep. With its curved design, you’ll barely notice the Amazfit X on your wrist as it follows you through the 4 stages of sleep: Light Sleep (Stages 1 and 2), Deep Sleep, and REM. It tracks you 24/7 to give you accurate, insightful data to help you understand and improve your sleeping patterns. The Amazfit X can even monitor your napping so that you can find the best time and length for that midday recharge.Sleep better, improve performance, and be ready for your next big moment with Amazfit X. The Amazfit X helps you stay stress-free. It monitors your heart rate throughout the day and will give you updates on where your stress levels are: Relaxed, Normal, Medium, and High. When stress levels are on the rise, the Amazfit X will be your hands-on indicator.  The watch takes on the responsibilities of a butler, proficiently handling your personal agendas, such as notifying incoming calls or messages and reminding you of sitting too long, not to mention calling for events and schedules. Feel a world of smart design just below the surface. The Amazfit X responds to your touch with textured, natural vibrations, so your fingertips know they’re in control. It’s built with quality and precision from the inside out, like a finely crafted watch should be. Your fingertips will feel the difference. On top of the smart control, the watch is incorporated with multiple handy settings such as Do Not Disturb, nap mode, timer, stopwatch, wake-up alarms, and weather forecast. Your outings will be hassle-free and very well established. With Amazfit X, your wrist becomes another canvas to express yourself.

We are glad to invite Eddy, a gadget enthusiast to visit Rokid's headquarters in Hangzhou and try Rokid Air. Let's see how he uses Rokid Air to connect with an Android phone & MacBook and enjoys the immersive screen.

Connect with an Android phone and MacBook:

 What you'll see on Rokid Air:


 


 Always Stay Hands-Free 
Thanks to the noise-canceling microphone and voice recognition technology, Rokid Air can clearly pick up your voice commands. This built-in smart assistant is always ready to help and is highly capable of performing tasks. Ask Rokid Air to play videos, open installed applications, control volume and brightness, and more. 

No Wake Word, No Waiting
Ever find yourself wanting to replay an important movie scene or fast forward through a commercial but the remote isn’t at hand? With Rokid Air's voice detection you are in total control. Best of all, commands and responses are practically instant without the need to wait for a wake word. Nothing could be easier! 


 

Rokid Air is perfect for people who wear glasses. By turning the focus adjustment knobs, nearsighted users (myopia of -5.00 D or less) can achieve perfect vision. You don’t have to wear your prescription lenses or contacts anymore!

 

Turn Your Phone into a Touchpad
Unlike VR sets, Rokid Air has a new and powerful way for you to interact with its virtual screen. You don’t have to buy extra controllers to move the pointer. Your phone becomes a versatile touchpad after connecting with Rokid Air.

How to Use?
Tap to click, slide to control the pointer...It's as easy as operating your laptop's trackpad.


Touchpad Gestures - Beginner's Guide:

 

High Resolution
The 1920*1080*2 resolution that Rokid Air produces results in crisp details, vivid colors, and stunning visuals. You can run native resolution on most of your devices without any difficulty and with excellent display quality.

High Refresh Rate & Brightness
Rokid Air's 75Hz refresh rate means more information reaches your eyes in the same amount of time, leading to smoother-looking motion. It can indeed do wonders for gamers. Meanwhile, with the BirdBath optical engine, the brightness is up to 1800 nits, which allows Rokid Air to look bright and clear even on the sunniest of days.


Immersive 120'' Display
Rokid Air offers crisp images with a large FoV. It’s like watching a 120'' screen from just a few feet away! You will be impressed by the experience, especially as it overlays onto your real-world surroundings, allowing you to see both the real and virtual worlds while playing a video or viewing other content at the same time.

Immersive, But Private
Rokid Air lets you enjoy entertainment in your own private world anywhere and anytime. Anything on the screen is completely private and invisible to others from any angle so you can discretely enjoy your content in total privacy.

 


 

Rokid Air is super lightweight and extremely comfortable, enabling you to wear it for long periods of time. It's like a huge monitor that fits in your pocket and goes anywhere with you!

 

Rokid Air doesn’t need charging. The device to which it is tethered supplies the power so you can enjoy more content, games, movies and fun. It is widely compatible with all devices: Android & IOS phones, desktop computers & laptops, PS4, Xbox and Switch. Simply plug & play to see apps, videos and games in front of you rather than having to struggle to view them on a small device screen.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Brand : FULLALOVE </strong></p>
<p>Fullalove Clothing Limited </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.fullaloveclothing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.fullaloveclothing.com</a></p>
<p>We are a young entrepreneurial 100% sustainable ethical fashion brand based in Leicester U.K. founded by the incredibly talented, smart, driven and resilient 27-year old Millie Fullalove.</p>
<p>PROLOGUE : Fast fashion is a terrible polluter with non-biodegradable oil-based synthetic textiles that get burnt or stuck in landfills polluting our planet and fast fashion often takes advantage of workers with criminally low pay levels and appalling working conditions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620661801/nqpsp1ixztblpkhmryxk.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BRAND FULLALOVE</strong> : Fullalove is the antithesis of fast fashion; we are slow fashion.  We value craftmanship; we use only organic sustainable fabrics and we treat workers with respect and dignity and pay them properly. We are totally transparent in all our operations and dealings. We design and construct on-trend beautiful fashion apparel which lasts for years and never goes out of fashion as great looks and styles don't! </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/547452137?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>We have traded for just one year now; we started trading May 2020 as the pandemic gripped the world.</p>
<p>We have successfully raised GBP 150,000 to date via a mix of grants, debt and equity to launch the business which started to trade just 12 months ago.</p>
<p>We have definitely proven concept as we now trade over 100 orders per month comprising the sale of circa 200 wonderfully-styled and constructed  organic fashion apparel garments each month.</p>
<p>We have secured our ethical supply line which is our Sedex-registered UK-based factory which we visit every week and we know it treats its workforce with respect and dignity and pays a good fair weekly wage</p>
<p>We now need scale to get to profitability and to grow our trading volumes, we need additional funding to finance our working capital needs.</p>
<p><strong>Our USPs </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exquisite bold unique designs : Millie’ handwriting is highly distinctive and appealing </li>
<li>On-trend styles and bold exotic patterns</li>
<li>Co-brand collaborations with shared-value artists : a significant driver of our sales success </li>
<li>Luxurious fabrics : origins fully traceable </li>
<li>High quality construction in our adjacent ethical Sedex-registered factory </li>
<li>Affordable customer prices </li>
<li>E-commerce super savvy </li>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Current Performance</strong></h3>
<p>We are now e-selling in excess of 100 orders each month, north of 250 garments each month, and growing our audiences of engaged followers and transacting shoppers. </p>
<p>We have our own Sedex-registered cut, make and trim [CMT] factory also based in Leicester. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620666710/vyznqwqjy7hkjgrdu6a4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Next Steps to Success</strong></h3>
<p>We now need to scale up to reach economic cash-flow profitability levels. </p>
<p>Extra funding is required to widen the currently  narrow range of each of our amazing collections, we are forced to limit the number of styles per collection today due to our limited financial resources.</p>
<p>We must also widen our product distribution channels.</p>
<p>We need to invest further in brand-building marketing and sales campaigns on social media and search engines such a Google.</p>
<p>We have a small highly competent leadership team supporting our mega-talented creative designer and founder <strong>Millie Fullalove</strong>.  Millie has had a burning passion for fashion since she was 8 years old and deeply cares for people and our planet. Brand Fullalove is everything she lives and breaths for. She is incredibly talented and the kindest soul ever. We have pledged our lives on supporting her to help her realize her life' ambition. She is a rare talent with a wonderful human cause backed by raw unbridled passion, a deep care for people and steely determination to succeed and to make a difference to the lives of others and our beloved planet.</p>
<p>She also really loves styling too!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Funding Target</strong></h3>
<p>GBP 225,000 is our required funding for growth.</p>
<p>We need to raise GBP 225,000 in cash to fund our increased working capital needs to get business scale. Today we have circa 100 monthly orders and this number has to increase to close to 400 to get to profitability. We know we can do it but we need extra funds for  the following :-</p>

</div><div>
<p>Yes, there are challenges and risks that lay ahead but we are quietly confident we can overcome these. </p>

<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>If you are not able to make a financial contribution, no worries. Please instead, get the word out  about brand <strong>Fullalove</strong>. Please spread the word as far and wide as you can. Use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
</div><p>Thank you so very much for reading this, our story and our mission in life. </p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>FOOTNOTE : a terrible experience and near-miss</strong></h3><p>Back in February this year, we were approached by an octogenarian Thai philanthropist and environmentalist who expressed his desire to invest in such benevolent sustainable causes as ours as part of his life legacy. He expressed fine ethical values and a genuine desire to now give back to others the wealth he had earned and accumulated during his long and successful life.  After almost three months of relationship building, information sharing, discussions and negotiations, we finally reached an agreement for him to invest a significant six figure amount into brand Fullalove. Millie and I were absolutely elated, really on cloud 9!</p><p>Then, right at the very last minute with agreements signed, bank of Thailand approvals obtained for overseas funds investments and with the said funds ready to be transferred to us, the truth became apparent. This entire interaction spanning three months  was actually a highly professional cyber scam. They went for the ""sting"" telling us that to get the funds released from Thailand, we would have to pay a GBP 25,000 fee into to Thailand. At that moment, the alarm bells rang and we realized the sad truth. We were about to be the victim of a highly professional cyber crime. Luckily, we avoided being stung but we had lost almost 90 days on this fallacious endeavor. </p><p>It was a horrible experience for Millie and me both, but we learned from it and here we are now fully recovered and excited to be live with our very first crowdfunding campaign. </p><p>We are hopeful for a positive outcome...please. </p></div>","Summary

We are a young entrepreneurial 100% sustainable ethical fashion brand based in Leicester U.K. founded by the incredibly talented, smart, driven and resilient 27-year old Millie Fullalove.
PROLOGUE : Fast fashion is a terrible polluter with non-biodegradable oil-based synthetic textiles that get burnt or stuck in landfills polluting our planet and fast fashion often takes advantage of workers with criminally low pay levels and appalling working conditions. 
 

 
BRAND FULLALOVE : Fullalove is the antithesis of fast fashion; we are slow fashion.  We value craftmanship; we use only organic sustainable fabrics and we treat workers with respect and dignity and pay them properly. We are totally transparent in all our operations and dealings. We design and construct on-trend beautiful fashion apparel which lasts for years and never goes out of fashion as great looks and styles don't! 

We have traded for just one year now; we started trading May 2020 as the pandemic gripped the world.
We have successfully raised GBP 150,000 to date via a mix of grants, debt and equity to launch the business which started to trade just 12 months ago.
We have definitely proven concept as we now trade over 100 orders per month comprising the sale of circa 200 wonderfully-styled and constructed  organic fashion apparel garments each month.
We have secured our ethical supply line which is our Sedex-registered UK-based factory which we visit every week and we know it treats its workforce with respect and dignity and pays a good fair weekly wage
We now need scale to get to profitability and to grow our trading volumes, we need additional funding to finance our working capital needs.
Our USPs 

Exquisite bold unique designs : Millie’ handwriting is highly distinctive and appealing 
On-trend styles and bold exotic patterns
Co-brand collaborations with shared-value artists : a significant driver of our sales success 
Luxurious fabrics : origins fully traceable 
High quality construction in our adjacent ethical Sedex-registered factory 
Affordable customer prices 
E-commerce super savvy 


 
Current Performance
We are now e-selling in excess of 100 orders each month, north of 250 garments each month, and growing our audiences of engaged followers and transacting shoppers. 
We have our own Sedex-registered cut, make and trim [CMT] factory also based in Leicester. 

 
Next Steps to Success
We now need to scale up to reach economic cash-flow profitability levels. 
Extra funding is required to widen the currently  narrow range of each of our amazing collections, we are forced to limit the number of styles per collection today due to our limited financial resources.
We must also widen our product distribution channels.
We need to invest further in brand-building marketing and sales campaigns on social media and search engines such a Google.
We have a small highly competent leadership team supporting our mega-talented creative designer and founder Millie Fullalove.  Millie has had a burning passion for fashion since she was 8 years old and deeply cares for people and our planet. Brand Fullalove is everything she lives and breaths for. She is incredibly talented and the kindest soul ever. We have pledged our lives on supporting her to help her realize her life' ambition. She is a rare talent with a wonderful human cause backed by raw unbridled passion, a deep care for people and steely determination to succeed and to make a difference to the lives of others and our beloved planet.
She also really loves styling too!

 
I, the author of this story, am Millie' business partner; I have worked for 35 years in business with American Express and then in the SME sector across SE Asia. Millie and I make for a perfect complementary partnership of exuberant talented youth and seasoned experience.
We are now attempting crowdfunding to secure the finances required to fuel our next stage growth.  Your contribution no matter how large or small, will help Millie realize her life' ambition. 
 
Funding Target
GBP 225,000 is our required funding for growth.
We need to raise GBP 225,000 in cash to fund our increased working capital needs to get business scale. Today we have circa 100 monthly orders and this number has to increase to close to 400 to get to profitability. We know we can do it but we need extra funds for  the following :-

In descriptive terms :-
•Finance our growth plans to get scale
•Fund expansion of product range; more styles per collection
•Build brand awareness; increase our social following and foster deep engagement
•Continue to invest in consultative experts to master all aspects of e-commerce especially addressing the needs of visitors to our virtual store along every step and stage of their initial discovery, learning, trust-gaining, value-based engagement  and then finally online shopping.
•Further expand our sales and distribution channels
•Fund 3 key new personnel hires : design + logistics + grading specialist
•Fund the purchase of a grading machine system - Vetigraph : GBP 20,000
•Secure a 2nd Sedex-registered ethical factory outlet

 
In precise financial terms:-


 
The Resultant Impact
The business will get to cash-flow breakeven at GBP 20,000 sales revenue per month and we will achieve that and then move beyond.
On a personal note, Millie' life  is 100% committed to make a positive difference to other people and our planet; she lives and breaths these genuine intentions and possesses a deep desire to make a positive difference and to create and develop a successful fashion business brand
She is a wonderful human being with a caring soul and a massive commitment to people and our planet.   She is an incredibly talented fashion apparel designer.
She is a becoming a savvy young entrepreneur who understands that no one individual can do it alone and has surrounded herself with winning team of fine complimentary talents.
I have backed Millie for the last 12 month. I have worked every day on brand Fullalove all pro bono [no monetary compensation]  as I want to help her realize her life' ambitions. She is a rare talent and she is determined and these two factors taken together with financial resources will lead to success. 
I have put my money where my mouth is with a GBP 50,000 cash commitment from me into the business. Please now join me and make your contribution too.
No amount is too large or too small.
I have total belief in Millie and brand Fullalove ; both will succeed. 

 
Risks & Challenges

Yes, there are challenges and risks that lay ahead but we are quietly confident we can overcome these. 
We can grow our loyal followers to the size they need to be. Six months ago, we had 2000 store visitors each month and now we have 8000. We are growing our transacting customers by a minimum of 80 per month. We have 25% repeat shoppers.  Millie can design hundreds of eye-catching beautiful designs. We are becoming smarter by the day in all matters e-commerce from organic SEO to Google Paid ads and social media marketing. We are expanding our distribution channels beyond just the UK and presently display our products in NYC Manhattan in-store and online and similarly across Spain too.

We know there are risks; but, we can meet them head-on and overcome them.
We have rich experience in successfully dealing with problems and solving them, with our never-say-can't attitude and perseverance.

Thank you so very much for reading this, our story and our mission in life.  FOOTNOTE : a terrible experience and near-missBack in February this year, we were approached by an octogenarian Thai philanthropist and environmentalist who expressed his desire to invest in such benevolent sustainable causes as ours as part of his life legacy. He expressed fine ethical values and a genuine desire to now give back to others the wealth he had earned and accumulated during his long and successful life.  After almost three months of relationship building, information sharing, discussions and negotiations, we finally reached an agreement for him to invest a significant six figure amount into brand Fullalove. Millie and I were absolutely elated, really on cloud 9!Then, right at the very last minute with agreements signed, bank of Thailand approvals obtained for overseas funds investments and with the said funds ready to be transferred to us, the truth became apparent. This entire interaction spanning three months  was actually a highly professional cyber scam. They went for the ""sting"" telling us that to get the funds released from Thailand, we would have to pay a GBP 25,000 fee into to Thailand. At that moment, the alarm bells rang and we realized the sad truth. We were about to be the victim of a highly professional cyber crime. Luckily, we avoided being stung but we had lost almost 90 days on this fallacious endeavor. It was a horrible experience for Millie and me both, but we learned from it and here we are now fully recovered and excited to be live with our very first crowdfunding campaign. We are hopeful for a positive outcome...please.",8.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>purME has undergone various design stages until it is finalized for prototyping.</strong></p>
<p>It all started out as drawings on paper. It has taken us numerous conceptual and technical drawings before we settled on the current design. Our mask combined the strength of various designs, put together as one mask that provides all-around comfort and protection.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594785847/xjbw23qxgp57pk1hm790.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Once the basic design has been completed, we convert the design into 3D CAD graphic for further editing. Several prototypes have been produced, so we can put them on face and do necessary fine-tuning. Other parts such as filter pod and strap have also undergone adjustments for ultimate comfort.</p>
<p>This is why purME will fit everyone comfortably for all-day wear!</p>

<p>purME was conceived by our team when we started to wear mask ourselves to protect against air pollution and other harmful particles.</p>
<p>We soon found out that none of the existing designs can provide the protection, comfort and convenience that we demanded. Most reusable masks only stop a limited type of pollutants, while the higher rated ones are way too bulky or uneconomical to use regularly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594627386/es37jzcwnga3nyb4hbms.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After months of work, we have finalized the design and fabricated several prototypes that are good enough for daily testing.</p>
<p>But to initialize mass production, we would need your help by pledging. We need to make mass-production tooling for the main silicone polymer face piece and plastic components, which are rather expensive. In addition, we would have to source material for the straps and accessories.</p>
<p>By pledging purME, you will fund our production and related costs. In return, you will receive the best daily mask before everybody else at <strong>over 60% off retail price!</strong> We may also include exclusive features and accessories for backers.</p>

<p>purME is the creation of a group of designers and engineers interested in making better reusable mask. Adopting unconventional designs with existing materials, we aim to create a reusable respirator with excellent protection, comfort and value for immediate use against air pollution and other threats. Through campaigning on Indiegogo, we wish to raise sufficient fund for testing, certification and production or purME. We have already secured production arrangements to fulfill at scheduled time.</p>

<p>We aim to raise concern about the invisible dangers of air pollution and air-transmitted threats, and to help people protect themselves with our affordable respirator product. By adopting common components and standards, owner of purME will be able to use other filtration devices for purME, directly or with minimal modification. So even in the worse case of disaster, owner will be able to keep it operational.</p>

  Taking the best features from a variety of designs, purME provides the protection of industrial respirator while retains the portability and comfort of lightweight pollution mask. Airflow valves are incorporated for extra seal and comfort. N95 level HEPA filters are included for daily use, with upgrade to P100 level (99.8%) extra protection available through an included adapter.  This is made possible only because purME is designed from scratch. Everything is designed ground-up by our team, so the end product suits your needs perfectly. The shape is crafted to make comfortable fit to people of all facial profiles. This makes purME a highly protective respirator with unrivaled comfort!               What Can it Protect Against?  Who Would Benefit From Wearing purME?            The protection level of purME has been tested and certified by a third-party testing lab for FDA and SAWS Standard GB 2626-2006. All purME filters will be manufactured to exact standards as the sample undertaken the test.The GB 2626-2006 KN95 (NIOSH N95 or EU FFP2 equivalent) test confirms that our filter has a 0.3um particles filtration efficiency of over 95%. This means the filter of purME will keep out the majority of harmful particles in the air. The flow rate also exceeds 85L/min, ensuring breathability under normal use. The silicone polymer material of the facepiece has been certified by LFGB of Germany to be free of organic vapor, heavy metals and harmful residues. The mask will be able to sustain long-term use and washing under suggested temperatures without degrading or releasing harmful substances. By design, the non-premeable silicone will stop 99.99% of harmful droplets.      purME is designed for a wide variety of users. You can order a number of filters according to your wearing need and pattern! Here is a reference for you: While purME is splash-proof, the filter is the only component that is not water proof and should avoid handling. Please replace filter as following:     
 

purME has undergone various design stages until it is finalized for prototyping.
It all started out as drawings on paper. It has taken us numerous conceptual and technical drawings before we settled on the current design. Our mask combined the strength of various designs, put together as one mask that provides all-around comfort and protection.

Once the basic design has been completed, we convert the design into 3D CAD graphic for further editing. Several prototypes have been produced, so we can put them on face and do necessary fine-tuning. Other parts such as filter pod and strap have also undergone adjustments for ultimate comfort.
This is why purME will fit everyone comfortably for all-day wear!
 
 

 

We are ready to get purME into mass production and the tooling is well completed. Once we reach our goal on Indiegogo, we will rapidly delivery this purME to you as soon as possible.
For the best possible quality, we have partnered with a manufacturer experienced in  producing medical supplies. With their expertise and certifications, we put trust in our partner for the production of high quality product according to our needs and demand.
Here is our completed tooling for the main silicone facepiece:

 


 


 
This is the pilot production of our KN95 filters:

 
 


 
 

 

 
Get 20 extra KN95 filters, offering up to 1000hrs of additional filtration protection. Add $15 (free shipping) to your total pledge for each additional set of 20 filters. 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 

purME was conceived by our team when we started to wear mask ourselves to protect against air pollution and other harmful particles.
We soon found out that none of the existing designs can provide the protection, comfort and convenience that we demanded. Most reusable masks only stop a limited type of pollutants, while the higher rated ones are way too bulky or uneconomical to use regularly.
 

 
After months of work, we have finalized the design and fabricated several prototypes that are good enough for daily testing.
But to initialize mass production, we would need your help by pledging. We need to make mass-production tooling for the main silicone polymer face piece and plastic components, which are rather expensive. In addition, we would have to source material for the straps and accessories.
By pledging purME, you will fund our production and related costs. In return, you will receive the best daily mask before everybody else at over 60% off retail price! We may also include exclusive features and accessories for backers.
 

 


 
 


purME is the creation of a group of designers and engineers interested in making better reusable mask. Adopting unconventional designs with existing materials, we aim to create a reusable respirator with excellent protection, comfort and value for immediate use against air pollution and other threats. Through campaigning on Indiegogo, we wish to raise sufficient fund for testing, certification and production or purME. We have already secured production arrangements to fulfill at scheduled time.
 
 

 

We aim to raise concern about the invisible dangers of air pollution and air-transmitted threats, and to help people protect themselves with our affordable respirator product. By adopting common components and standards, owner of purME will be able to use other filtration devices for purME, directly or with minimal modification. So even in the worse case of disaster, owner will be able to keep it operational.",82.0,1,"2 Campaigns

The effect of the natural element silver is exclusively based on free silver ions. Due to a triple effect mechanism, silver ions with a positive charge have odor protection effects.SILVERPLUS®is, therefore, capable of contributing to stopping odor-causing elements.Comfort finish against perspiration odorHygiene, protection and freshness for tomorrow‘s textiles - longer use, and less water consumption.THE PROBLEMAfter only a short period of use underwear made of synthetic fibers develop odors. One feels uncomfortable and no longer ready for the rest of the day. This unpleasant, but unfortunately common problem is well known. The clean and often washed underwear starts developing odors after only a short period of use. Although not dirty, it will be washed again.Further  30° - 40 °C / 86° - 104° F wash cycles will not improve this; quite the contrary,  constant wash cycles affect the underwear and finally, it will be thrown  away.THE REASONSOdor-causing elements, require certain pre-conditions, temperature and above all, moisture. This is why textiles worn next to the skin are especially ideal for odor-causing elements. Due to low washing temperatures odor-causing elements in the textile cannot be controlled; therefore, they continue to cause increasingly unpleasant odors in the textile.THE REMEDIESSILVERPLUS® is the most intelligent and innovative manner for your textiles to economically and ecologically enter new fresh dimensions. The SILVERPLUS® finish protects your textiles from unpleasant body odors, even at low washing temperatures. The need to wash a textile due to unpleasant body odors, will disappear. This also prolongs its life span. This is why SILVERPLUS® is not only economical, but has direct ecological effects during wearing, washing, drying and storing. Freshness and moisture managementPerfect synergism of freshness and optimized moisture transportGood moisture management is indispensible for comfortable freshness.The hydrophilic finishing agents transport body moisture and the  odour-causing elements away from the body into the textile where it is  dispersed; SILVERPLUS® then suppresses the formation of odours.              1 ...Perspiration-absorbing textile with SILVERPLUS® protective system, optimum moisture evaporation on the textile‘s face              2 ...Moisture evaporation between skin/textile              3 ...Perspiration-producing skinSave The Planet. Wash Less. Apixt underwear stay fresh even at low-temperature washes—you won’t  need high-temperature washes and strong detergents to wash them off.  Aside from cutting your consumption on water and detergent, you also  help in conserving our natural resources while reducing our carbon  footprint. Our Factory""Our factory environment adheres to the highest standards of eco-friendliness, and maintain membership in the Global Eco-Initiative Detox.

When you are back in range and your phone reconnects with your Accent, you can make it ring to find it.   RECHARGEABLE BATTERY - The Accent has a long battery life that lasts at least 6 months, so you only need to charge it twice a year! A completely drained Accent takes only 2 hours to be fully charged, so it can get right back to work. The Innway app will notify you when your battery is low to remind you to charge the Accent.   CARD RELEASE - Pull the quick-release trigger to pop your cards out. Our patented release mechanism is almost instantaneous but holds the card firmly so they won’t fall out, even if you hold the Accent upside down. The cards only come out when you pull the out by hand, and they just slide out.In fact, you don't even have to take your cards out. Why take them out and risk misplacing the cards? Scan with your card without having to take it out of the Accent, and then push it back when you're done.   CASH QUICK DRAW - Our innovative design lets you take cash out of the Accent without having to fully open it. Count the cash with ease and pull out the notes you need.   RFID SECURITY - The card holder is RFID/NFC protected to block any malicious attempts to skim your cards.   ULTRA SLIM STYLISH - Some wallets and cardholders sacrifice durability in their pursuit of ultra-slim form factor. Accent uses smart design to achieve maximum durability and usability while staying slim.   PREMIUM ARTISAN QUALITY - We handcraft the Accent using the highest quality genuine leather that age well with use. The more you handle the leather, the more pronounced the character it acquires.       We are introducing two colors during Kickstarter: the Classic Black in nappa leather and Vintage Brown in crazy horse leather.Nothing says classic and style like black. The Classic Black edition is made with premium nappa leather that ages well and takes on a shiny look from daily handling.Crazy horse leather has been very popular in recent years. Our Vintage Brown edition is made with crazy horse leather that takes on unique characteristics by wearing the scratches and marks proudly. Perfect for those of you who love patina and wabi sabi.     We have over thousands of users who love our Innway family. It humbles us to be able to grow with our users and improve both the software and hardware with your feedback.To show our gratitude, we are bundling our popular Innway products with the Innway Accent at special Kickstarter prices.  The Innway Card turns traditional wallets into smart wallets, and many users have been asking for a wallet that comes with Innway tech built in.    Instead of just making a smart wallet that comes with built-in Innway finder function, we created a smart wallet with a smart design.        We recently upgraded the charging cable for our Innway Card and Chip. With the feedback from our users and tests done by our engineers, we gained a lot of insight on about how to improving the charging clip. With the Accent, we designed a new clip to with the added thickness of leather so the charging pins fit snugly on the contact points.    1. Built-in Bluetooth finderThe Accent comes with our Innway Bluetooth finder technology built directly in the wallet. Other brands in the market partner with third party solution so they have less control over the app, and often need to make compromises to make the hardware fit in their product. We designed the hardware together with the wallet for maximum performance and compatibility.2. Rechargeable batteryUnlike other wallets in the market that require you to remove the finder to charge it, the Accent is has a rechargeable battery that lasts at least 6 months, so you only need to charge it twice a year. It takes a mere 2 hours to get a full charge. The Innway app will remind you when the battery is running low, so you can ensure the Accent is always juiced up.3. Innway expertiseThe Innway team consists of experts with years of experience in both Bluetooth finder hardware and software. Our intimate knowledge of the industry empowers us to create products that address the shortcoming of the offerings available in the market, while removing superfluous features that are more marketing gimmicks than practical functions. Since the Innway tech is an in-house solution, we are in full control over the features and direction of the product.4. Affordable priceIf you buy an Innway Card and a wallet separately, you'll end up spending a lot more than getting just the Innway Accent that is a wallet and has the Innway tech built-in. A retail price of USD 99 is very affordable for a premium artisanal leather that comes with the Innway function built in. The Innway Card alone retails for USD 39. We are offering the Accent at 55% off retail price only during our Kickstarter!5. Proven track recordWe have been selling the Innway Card on Amazon for over a year and we have thousands of happy users who often tell us how thankful they are because our product helped them time and again. It is very humbling for us as a small startup and it pushes us to keep improving our products and creating more innovative ideas.             Innway = Innovative WayInnway strives to use technology through innovative ways to help you find things that matter to you.We believe in using technology to help people locate things that matter to them most.
