<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> <strong>Become a ""Friend of Frankincense"" </strong></p>
<p>We're creating a small eco-preserve to grow endangered Frankincense (and other Torchwood) trees. It's <strong>Frankincense and Myrrh</strong>, the trees that produce fragrant, oily resins, and key medicinals spoken of in the Bible... along with another of the precious holy oils like <strong>Balm of Gilead</strong> (commiphora gileadensis known as <strong>""Gold""</strong> in antiquities,) and also Agarwood trees (aquilaria) the source of Oudh, one of the most heavenly perfume scents on earth.  </p>
<p><strong>All are endangered,</strong> some critically so, or increasingly found only in specimen gardens. Pure biblical Frankincense, Boswellia<em> Sacra</em>, the source of royal hougari comes from Oman. Those groves are environmentally threatened by climate change and human conflict. The hundred year old trees are stressed, over - tapped, abused, poisoned, poached, and trafficked... And what we do to the Frankincense, we do to children. </p>
<p>But in this garden and SAFE haven, we will PROTECT and NURTURE both. We'll propagate, and proliferate the Frankincense and other Torchwoods to share with all. Once secured and abundantly propagated, we will use the mature trees to help secure an inheritance and brighter future for children ...especially endangered, trafficked, and orphaned children. </p>
<p>One of the best places we can help each other reconnect, and open our hearts to childlike awe and wonder again, and renewed sense of innocence is in the midst of nature.  </p>
<p><strong>What do we need?  To put down roots - literally.</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Frankincense seedlings, from a rare collection, are ready and waiting to be sent. Yet, we need all the accoutrements necessary for gardening and experimental agronomy in order to properly and safely receive them.   </li>
<li>We need a larger space; land, a greenhouse, water, a classroom, the trees themselves, container pots in various sizes and kinds (clay, plastic, smart pots, etc) for cultivation and for growth. We need to move some dirt around, so we need all gardening tools, other implements, and equipment, hardscape/ softscape elements, grow-lights, bees, butterflies, worms, seeds, companioning trees, and other biblical plants and herbs, electronic equipment, and education materials.</li>
<li>If you would like a complete garden list, I've made one. If you want to see a business plan, I've written one, with a projected three-year budget. </li>
<li>If you'd like to donate land itself, we’d be grateful for 1-5 acres which numerically, means: ""a certain small something, not much but enough to build on"" or upwards to 50.  </li>
</ul><p><a href=""http://hometribe.blogspot.com/2012/08/47-acres.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""""><strong>Why Frankincense?</strong></span></a></p>
<ul>
<li>We're focused on Frankincense, pure biblical Frankincense - Boswellia <em>Sacra </em>(not b. Carteri from Somalia, or b. Serrata from India) - because of its history, and universal importance.  Frankincense is universally recognized around the globe as beneficial and valuable by all cultures and traditions for its spiritual, natural, and medicinal qualities, as an expression of good will, and source of wellbeing, peace, and enlightenment.</li>
<li>Frankincense being so universally loved and in demand gave rise and cause of the world's first global economy, and was the reason for our first peaceful trade routes and treaties. For those reasons, Frankincense sets an important, even priceless precedence. </li>
<li>Frankincense is a banner tree for all humanity: A tree of abundance, good health, peace, and unity - symbolizing the best of human endeavors.</li>
<li>Frankincense has historically been the gift of royalty-acceptable in every realm, and it is still a fitting gift to royal houses, or heads of state, popes, ambassadors, and other world dignitaries.  </li>
<li>The wise men carried Frankincense to the baby Jesus in his Nativity, because they believed him to be the King of kings. Yet, it transcends borders, barriers, and ranks of all kinds. We must not let this bridge-builder go on being endangered. </li>
<li>If the above isn’t cause enough, Scientific research is now re-discovering how Frankincense works at the DNA level to accomplish its good work.  Researchers believe it may be an effective treatment for some cancers. </li>
<li>Frankincense is part of the new post 2012 paradigm - One word for a newly awakened and aware human race and its Economy of Grace: Frankincense.  It is a priceless gift placed here for all God's children.</li>
<li><strong><em>""The leaves of the trees are for the healing of the nations.""</em></strong></li>
</ul><p><strong>What will it look like?</strong>      </p>
<ul>
<li>We'll begin<em> with the preservation of Frankincense</em> as our most immediate focal point and purpose. We'll add the other torchwood trees, and beyond the greenhouse nursery, we'll cultivate the outdoor biblical garden, and a small companion grove of fruiting and nutting trees, fragrant and flowering bushes, and other precious biblical herbs and rare medicinal plants.  Ultimately, with our 30,000 organic, non-hybrid heirloom seeds we purchased, we'll put in a permaculture food-forest to mature and bring forth their produce.</li>
<li>We need to locate near a natural water source (a spring, river, or irrigateable land) and for sustainability, build a water reclamation tower with friends who know how from recycled (local-sourcing) materials. We'll create a water feature with flowing water: a fountain or pool.</li>
<li> </li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Find someone who's doing something right, and help them do it faster, better, and more efficiently.""</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>YOU:  I can't do it alone - How can you help?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A<em>s Helen Keller once said, “ I am only one person, and alone I can do nothing, but together, we can do something, so I will not refuse to do the one thing that I can do.”</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Saving these precious trees on the planet would be enough, but the garden preserve will act as a retreat, and outdoor classroom, to interact with students and adults. It will be a living library and visible index of love and wisdom descending out of heaven and taking shape in the world around us.  </li>
<li>We will create curriculum and an educational program to raise awareness, using an open-sourced educational platform. We’ll start immediately raising awareness, designing, planting, educating, and continue networking and collaborating. </li>
<li>This is a<em> sustainable</em> plan to make the dream of helping orphaned children a tangible and lasting reality. Once secured, and abundantly propagated, the sales from the mature trees, valuable seedlings, saplings, oil, and derived botanical products will help secure a better future and inheritance for all children.</li>
<li>We'll begin immediately working with cultural exchange and youth organizations, and ecology, environmental, and preservation groups to increase the worldwide presence, and availability of Frankincense trees. We'll create educational curriculum about all the Torchwood trees, their history, and use. </li>
<li>With this fundraiser, if you elect to donat just a small portion of the $144,000 goal, we will be on our way, and I will make it my work to<strong><em> multiply your giving. </em></strong>I invite anyone, and everyone, to be a part of helping restore a little innocence to the earth by <em>making a place of belonging and safety for two very precious <strong>""least of these"" </strong></em>which we've left endangered, and all but abandoned.  Please don’t let ""no room at the Inn"" be our problem!  </li>
</ul><p><strong>WHO: Who is organizing this? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are a small but growing global network of indiviuals (""HomeTribe"") concerned about the plight of children and the condition of the planet. ""HomeTribe"" pledging to help this cause evolve from its first inkling: “To protect innocence and help provide for a more sustainable future and a thriving humanity.”  They're individuals who have been steadily offering support; their skills, interest, and hard work as needed.</li>
<li>I myself (Carla), am a Christian minister ordained in an ecumenical tradition (M Div) and an educator (BS in Early Childhood Education) awaiting my teacher certification status, by the Arizona Board of Education (my ""Bread &amp; Butter"")  </li>
<li>I’m a theologian with a ministry in eco-justice, focusing in sustainability: *Sustainable Earth (care of creation) *Sustainable Structures (Architecture, and Educational platforms) &amp; *Sustainable Lives (children and community.) My project draws these three areas together. </li>
<li>I've been searching for a catalyst to springboard support to the care for orphaned and endangered children. I belive this is it. </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW: Proven Track record </strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Welsh Frankincense Tree Project (<a href=""http://www.frankincensetree.com/#!project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.frankincensetree.com/#!project</a>) has shown the trees can be carefully cultivated and propagated.  This took 6-8 years of careful cultivation.  They should now however be moved out of isolation and private collections and given worldwide distribution, if their full protection and benefit for mankind is to be realized.</li>
<li>We've done a similar large-scale garden project in San Diego, where we restored an historic garden, involved lots of people and groups, master gardeners, various community groups, neighbors, and local businesses. Once to a certain stage, we opened its beauty and peace up to wider enjoyment which is still going on today. It was a success and good training ground, for this project of worldwide importance.  </li>
<li>Here in Arizona, we are uniquely situated in the perfect climate to ensure future success and survival of the trees. The tree is non-invasive and in fact, it’s nearly impossible to grow them from seed. Few can, even fewer have done so, and yet it has been accomplished for this project.  </li>
<li>Many individuals and groups will be involved in this project: Nature and Youth organizations, scouting, adventure, conservation, environmental, and ecological groups. We will also lobby the World Parliament of Religions, to adopt Frankincense as a Tree of great importance and common global interest. </li>
<li>We’re following in the footsteps of others in the Swedenborgian ecological tradition: Naturalists John (Appleseed) Chapman, John Muir (Sierra Club) George Innes (Landscape painter) and Eliza Lovell Tibbets (experimental agronomist, abolitionist, grower of the seedless navel orange and Mother of the Citrus industry) who were also considered spiritual entrepreneurs.</li>
<li>This protective Oasis, is to become a place of peace, meditation, beauty, and good uses.  No matter what though, even if we don't reach our goal, the nursery can go forward with whatever funds and means are received, just at a slower pace.  If we exceed our donation goals, we'll accelerate our plans and help to the children.  </li>
</ul><p><strong>IF you've learned all you need to GO FUND, then GREAT! Be an angel and check out the 12 PERKS to see which level suits you!  </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>If you want to learn more, please feel free to read on... </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>What's happened so far? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have starter trees, of rare and incomparable value; they exist nowhere else on the planet in this plentiful way. They will be a gift from The Welsh Frankincense Tree Project (WFTP.) They are ready and waiting to be shipped.  <a href=""http://www.frankincensetree.com/#!project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.frankincensetree.com/#!project</a>.</li>
<li>Stateside, we have appropriate mentoring from my close minister-colleague, the grower and horticulturist at the WFTP.  I've been under tutelage for almost two years, but now need to be in receipt of the seedlings. We have a reliable, reputable resource for how to grow and care for the Frankincense.</li>
<li>HomeTribe also has 30,000 organic, non-hybrid, non-GMO seeds for fruits and herbs. We're already creating energy for the project and community involvement until we have our own land. We've begun one beautiful community garden, and will help facilitate more.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>THE CHILDREN:  Not sure what is the connection is between the trees and children? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is an attack on innocence. </li>
<li>The Frankincense trees are endangered through climate change and environmental destruction, and human conflict. The groves are further abused, by being over-tapped abused, plundered, poached, and their resin and oil trafficked.  </li>
<li><strong><em>Like a canary in the mines, the trees are a litmus test on how we're doing as a humanity. What we do to the earth, we do to children. </em></strong></li>
<li>We are experiencing worldwide devastation of the earth, its flora and fauna (by the most conservative estimates, 27,000 species go extinct every year), and its natural resources. The United Nations’ biodiversity chief in 2010 warned that nations risk economic collapse and loss of culture if we do not protect the natural world and its biodiversity. Humankind is faring no better.</li>
<li>The abolitionist movement estimates 27 million individuals trafficked worldwide—mostly women and children, enslaved in forced labor or outright captivity.</li>
<li>And if that wasn’t enough, there are between 143 and 210 million orphans worldwide with 2.1 million in the United States, and 10 million in Mexico (UNICEF, 2009). There is an ongoing and sustained attack on innocence that must be countered.</li>
<li>Perhaps you have a desire similar to ours, to help restore endangered, at-risk children to a level of renewed hope, health, safety, and happiness, playful joy, belonging, and a regained sense of innocence.  </li>
</ul><p>One of the best places we can help each other reconnect, and open our hearts to that childlike awe and wonder, and renewed sense of innocence is in the midst of nature. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>AND: Other Ways You Can Help - Please Share &amp; Get the word out. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even if you can't contribute a whole heap of dollar$ or even a few, we still need you. We need your awareness, your well wishes, <strong>your prayers</strong> and help talking it up. We ask that you share this extremely important project with nature enthusiasts, gardening friends, spiritual folks who love peace, AND good health, lovers and caretakers of the earth, and anyone who cares about a future for children. </li>

All are endangered, some critically so, or increasingly found only in specimen gardens. Pure biblical Frankincense, Boswellia Sacra, the source of royal hougari comes from Oman. Those groves are environmentally threatened by climate change and human conflict. The hundred year old trees are stressed, over - tapped, abused, poisoned, poached, and trafficked... And what we do to the Frankincense, we do to children. 
But in this garden and SAFE haven, we will PROTECT and NURTURE both. We'll propagate, and proliferate the Frankincense and other Torchwoods to share with all. Once secured and abundantly propagated, we will use the mature trees to help secure an inheritance and brighter future for children ...especially endangered, trafficked, and orphaned children. 
One of the best places we can help each other reconnect, and open our hearts to childlike awe and wonder again, and renewed sense of innocence is in the midst of nature.  
What do we need?  To put down roots - literally. 

Frankincense seedlings, from a rare collection, are ready and waiting to be sent. Yet, we need all the accoutrements necessary for gardening and experimental agronomy in order to properly and safely receive them.   
We need a larger space; land, a greenhouse, water, a classroom, the trees themselves, container pots in various sizes and kinds (clay, plastic, smart pots, etc) for cultivation and for growth. We need to move some dirt around, so we need all gardening tools, other implements, and equipment, hardscape/ softscape elements, grow-lights, bees, butterflies, worms, seeds, companioning trees, and other biblical plants and herbs, electronic equipment, and education materials.
If you would like a complete garden list, I've made one. If you want to see a business plan, I've written one, with a projected three-year budget. 
If you'd like to donate land itself, we’d be grateful for 1-5 acres which numerically, means: ""a certain small something, not much but enough to build on"" or upwards to 50.  
Why Frankincense?

We're focused on Frankincense, pure biblical Frankincense - Boswellia Sacra (not b. Carteri from Somalia, or b. Serrata from India) - because of its history, and universal importance.  Frankincense is universally recognized around the globe as beneficial and valuable by all cultures and traditions for its spiritual, natural, and medicinal qualities, as an expression of good will, and source of wellbeing, peace, and enlightenment.
Frankincense being so universally loved and in demand gave rise and cause of the world's first global economy, and was the reason for our first peaceful trade routes and treaties. For those reasons, Frankincense sets an important, even priceless precedence. 
Frankincense is a banner tree for all humanity: A tree of abundance, good health, peace, and unity - symbolizing the best of human endeavors.
Frankincense has historically been the gift of royalty-acceptable in every realm, and it is still a fitting gift to royal houses, or heads of state, popes, ambassadors, and other world dignitaries.  
The wise men carried Frankincense to the baby Jesus in his Nativity, because they believed him to be the King of kings. Yet, it transcends borders, barriers, and ranks of all kinds. We must not let this bridge-builder go on being endangered. 
If the above isn’t cause enough, Scientific research is now re-discovering how Frankincense works at the DNA level to accomplish its good work.  Researchers believe it may be an effective treatment for some cancers. 
Frankincense is part of the new post 2012 paradigm - One word for a newly awakened and aware human race and its Economy of Grace: Frankincense.  It is a priceless gift placed here for all God's children.
""The leaves of the trees are for the healing of the nations.""
What will it look like?      

We'll begin with the preservation of Frankincense as our most immediate focal point and purpose. We'll add the other torchwood trees, and beyond the greenhouse nursery, we'll cultivate the outdoor biblical garden, and a small companion grove of fruiting and nutting trees, fragrant and flowering bushes, and other precious biblical herbs and rare medicinal plants.  Ultimately, with our 30,000 organic, non-hybrid heirloom seeds we purchased, we'll put in a permaculture food-forest to mature and bring forth their produce.
We need to locate near a natural water source (a spring, river, or irrigateable land) and for sustainability, build a water reclamation tower with friends who know how from recycled (local-sourcing) materials. We'll create a water feature with flowing water: a fountain or pool.
 
Find someone who's doing something right, and help them do it faster, better, and more efficiently.""
YOU:  I can't do it alone - How can you help?
As Helen Keller once said, “ I am only one person, and alone I can do nothing, but together, we can do something, so I will not refuse to do the one thing that I can do.”

Saving these precious trees on the planet would be enough, but the garden preserve will act as a retreat, and outdoor classroom, to interact with students and adults. It will be a living library and visible index of love and wisdom descending out of heaven and taking shape in the world around us.  
We will create curriculum and an educational program to raise awareness, using an open-sourced educational platform. We’ll start immediately raising awareness, designing, planting, educating, and continue networking and collaborating. 
This is a sustainable plan to make the dream of helping orphaned children a tangible and lasting reality. Once secured, and abundantly propagated, the sales from the mature trees, valuable seedlings, saplings, oil, and derived botanical products will help secure a better future and inheritance for all children.
We'll begin immediately working with cultural exchange and youth organizations, and ecology, environmental, and preservation groups to increase the worldwide presence, and availability of Frankincense trees. We'll create educational curriculum about all the Torchwood trees, their history, and use. 
With this fundraiser, if you elect to donat just a small portion of the $144,000 goal, we will be on our way, and I will make it my work to multiply your giving. I invite anyone, and everyone, to be a part of helping restore a little innocence to the earth by making a place of belonging and safety for two very precious ""least of these"" which we've left endangered, and all but abandoned.  Please don’t let ""no room at the Inn"" be our problem!  
WHO: Who is organizing this? 

We are a small but growing global network of indiviuals (""HomeTribe"") concerned about the plight of children and the condition of the planet. ""HomeTribe"" pledging to help this cause evolve from its first inkling: “To protect innocence and help provide for a more sustainable future and a thriving humanity.”  They're individuals who have been steadily offering support; their skills, interest, and hard work as needed.
I myself (Carla), am a Christian minister ordained in an ecumenical tradition (M Div) and an educator (BS in Early Childhood Education) awaiting my teacher certification status, by the Arizona Board of Education (my ""Bread & Butter"")  
I’m a theologian with a ministry in eco-justice, focusing in sustainability: *Sustainable Earth (care of creation) *Sustainable Structures (Architecture, and Educational platforms) & *Sustainable Lives (children and community.) My project draws these three areas together. 
I've been searching for a catalyst to springboard support to the care for orphaned and endangered children. I belive this is it. 
 
HOW: Proven Track record 

 Welsh Frankincense Tree Project (http://www.frankincensetree.com/#!project) has shown the trees can be carefully cultivated and propagated.  This took 6-8 years of careful cultivation.  They should now however be moved out of isolation and private collections and given worldwide distribution, if their full protection and benefit for mankind is to be realized.
We've done a similar large-scale garden project in San Diego, where we restored an historic garden, involved lots of people and groups, master gardeners, various community groups, neighbors, and local businesses. Once to a certain stage, we opened its beauty and peace up to wider enjoyment which is still going on today. It was a success and good training ground, for this project of worldwide importance.  
Here in Arizona, we are uniquely situated in the perfect climate to ensure future success and survival of the trees. The tree is non-invasive and in fact, it’s nearly impossible to grow them from seed. Few can, even fewer have done so, and yet it has been accomplished for this project.  
Many individuals and groups will be involved in this project: Nature and Youth organizations, scouting, adventure, conservation, environmental, and ecological groups. We will also lobby the World Parliament of Religions, to adopt Frankincense as a Tree of great importance and common global interest. 
We’re following in the footsteps of others in the Swedenborgian ecological tradition: Naturalists John (Appleseed) Chapman, John Muir (Sierra Club) George Innes (Landscape painter) and Eliza Lovell Tibbets (experimental agronomist, abolitionist, grower of the seedless navel orange and Mother of the Citrus industry) who were also considered spiritual entrepreneurs.
This protective Oasis, is to become a place of peace, meditation, beauty, and good uses.  No matter what though, even if we don't reach our goal, the nursery can go forward with whatever funds and means are received, just at a slower pace.  If we exceed our donation goals, we'll accelerate our plans and help to the children.  
IF you've learned all you need to GO FUND, then GREAT! Be an angel and check out the 12 PERKS to see which level suits you!  
 
If you want to learn more, please feel free to read on... 
What's happened so far? 

We have starter trees, of rare and incomparable value; they exist nowhere else on the planet in this plentiful way. They will be a gift from The Welsh Frankincense Tree Project (WFTP.) They are ready and waiting to be shipped.  http://www.frankincensetree.com/#!project.
Stateside, we have appropriate mentoring from my close minister-colleague, the grower and horticulturist at the WFTP.  I've been under tutelage for almost two years, but now need to be in receipt of the seedlings. We have a reliable, reputable resource for how to grow and care for the Frankincense.
HomeTribe also has 30,000 organic, non-hybrid, non-GMO seeds for fruits and herbs. We're already creating energy for the project and community involvement until we have our own land. We've begun one beautiful community garden, and will help facilitate more.
 
THE CHILDREN:  Not sure what is the connection is between the trees and children? 

There is an attack on innocence. 
The Frankincense trees are endangered through climate change and environmental destruction, and human conflict. The groves are further abused, by being over-tapped abused, plundered, poached, and their resin and oil trafficked.  
Like a canary in the mines, the trees are a litmus test on how we're doing as a humanity. What we do to the earth, we do to children. 
We are experiencing worldwide devastation of the earth, its flora and fauna (by the most conservative estimates, 27,000 species go extinct every year), and its natural resources. The United Nations’ biodiversity chief in 2010 warned that nations risk economic collapse and loss of culture if we do not protect the natural world and its biodiversity. Humankind is faring no better.
The abolitionist movement estimates 27 million individuals trafficked worldwide—mostly women and children, enslaved in forced labor or outright captivity.
And if that wasn’t enough, there are between 143 and 210 million orphans worldwide with 2.1 million in the United States, and 10 million in Mexico (UNICEF, 2009). There is an ongoing and sustained attack on innocence that must be countered.
Perhaps you have a desire similar to ours, to help restore endangered, at-risk children to a level of renewed hope, health, safety, and happiness, playful joy, belonging, and a regained sense of innocence.  
One of the best places we can help each other reconnect, and open our hearts to that childlike awe and wonder, and renewed sense of innocence is in the midst of nature.

<p>Just like the canvas shopping bags and metal water bottles everyone now carries, PeopleTowels are designed for portability. The custom-made fabric is absorbent, yet it dries quickly for on-the-go use. The winning art is expected to be a fun, whimsical design that will be printed with eco-friendly dyes, to encourage the B.Y.O.Towel™ habit.  Convenient hangtags even allow kids to clip or loop PeopleTowels to a backpack or tuck into lunch bags or bento boxes.</p>

<p><strong>Every September 1st, an annual hunt beings; a hunt for wild dolphins.</strong> From September to March, wild dolphins are hunted and driven into a natural cove of water along the shores of Taiji, Japan. Some are sold into captivity, most are slaughtered for human consumption.</p>
<p>In November 2010, I went to the Cove as a volunteer for one week. At the end of that week, I extended my stay to three weeks. At the end of three weeks, I extended my stay in Japan to four months. For 110 days I stood on the rocky shores of the Cove and watched, helplessly, while the lives of dolphins were shattered by my own species. The only way I could fight was via my photography and writing. So I wrote and I photographed and I sent those words and pictures around the world.</p>
<p>I left Japan in March of 2011 and now, finally, it's time to go back. <strong>This coming September I will travel to Japan for the third time</strong> and stand with Ric O'Barry (star of the Academy Award winning documentary, The Cove) and the incredible people of Save Japan Dolphins. The purpose of our being there is not to encourage anti-Japan feelings and actions, but to work with the local people and raise awareness about the importance of cetaceans and the dangers of consuming their mercury-laden meat.</p>
<p>In order to make this odyssy possible for me,<strong> I need to fundraise a minimum of $3,000</strong> to cover airfare ($1,500), train travel within Japan, rental car in Taiji, food, accommodation, International driver's license and any emergency needs that arise while overseas.</p>
<p>During the week I am in Japan, I will be video blogging so that you can follow, should you choose, the work we are doing at the Cove. These video blogs will show exactly what we do while at the Cove, how we interact with local people and the behind-the-scenes work that happens when involved with an International campaign. <strong>Diplomacy and respect are key</strong> and are two aspects of my work in Japan that mean the most to me as a person and as a conservationist.</p>
<p>In addition to standing with Ric O'Barry and supporting Save Japan Dolphins, I will also be representing my own marine conservation non-profit, Blue Ocean Foundation. <strong>All donations to this campaign are tax-deductable due to my 501c3 status.</strong></p>

<p>My name is Danais and I was reared on the island of <strong>Vieques, Puerto</strong> <strong>Rico</strong>.

<p>Residents of the island are either sick or have friends or relatives who are ill as a consequence of contaminants deployed by the U.S. Navy.

Without this instrumental piece of evidence, their case and lawsuit will most likely be dismissed.

<h2>Skip To Renew: Going Beyond Bike Lube</h2>
<p>Hey Everyone! At Skip To Renew we make machine lubricants out of plant and algae oils. In order to scale-up our algae growing operation, we need $4,020 for growth equipment and $4,090 to run all the neccesary tests for getting our product into trucks. We thank you for helping us build the post-petroleum economy by sharing our link and making a contribution! </p>
<h3>Our Mission, Progress, and Impact</h3>
<p>Our mission <span>is to provide high-quality renewable, non-toxic, biodegradable industrial lubricants made from sustainably-sourced plant and algae oils to help transition to a clean, post-petroleum economy. E<em>very unit of bio-based product that we sell is a vote for petroleum independence and a cleaner, more resilient economy.</em></span></p>
<p>We are a team of Dominican University greenMBAs, a Biochemist, a former Air Force Flight Engineer, a 10 year sales veteran, and 1 UC Berkeley Business School grad...all working for sweat-equity (<em>aka free</em>) to make Skip To Renew happen.</p>

<li>The Mexican government has spent aproximatly 30 million dollars over the last 10 years on Vaquita conservation. Much of that money was unwisely spent. Vaquita are on the brink of extinction. Due to the highly endangered status (Around 60) of the small Vaquita porpoise in the northern gulf region of the Sea of Cortes WorldsAquarium (WA) is funding an independent observer program to monitor the newly enacted governmental ban on gill net fishing with in Vaquita habitat. The Mexican government in conjunction with the international committee for the <a href=""http://worldsaquarium.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CIRVA-VI-Draft-Report-5-29-2015-no-annex-2-REV-2-FINAL-for-IWC.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #0000FF;"">Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA) have welcomed the participation of non governmental organizations (NGO) </span></a>to actively engage in the observation of the recently installed total gill net ban within the habitat range of the Vaquita.</li>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 24px;"">Where the money goes</span></strong></p>
<p>The goal is to fund a multi month observation program within the Vaquita range of habitat starting around at the end of November with the goal of extending the program indefinitely, <b>since Vaquita conservation will be a decades long process. </b>WorldsAquarium has two vessels that would work well in the area. One vessel is a shallow drafted 40 foot double A cutter rigged trimaran capable of heavy weather sailing and extended time at sea. The other is a very fast 25 foot super panga with twin 115 horse power four stroke engines. Both these vessels will patrol the Vaquita habitat and be in constant communication with each other.</p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 24px;"">The Impact</span></strong></p>
<p>WorldsAquarium has battled the illegal dorado fishery in Mexico for many years now and is intimately familiar with the nature of illegal fishing in the Sea of Cortes. Our determined commitment to conservation over the last decade is well documented.</p>
<p>By funding this campaign you are greatly increasing transparency on the part of the Mexican government and the chances that Mexico will indeed finally take the necessary actions in Vaquita conservation seriously as well as directly aiding in Vaquita recovery in the northern gulf region of the Sea of Cortes.</p>
<p>After 10 years of concentrated conservation effort and approximately 30 million dollars spent the desert porpoise refereed to as La Vaquita is on the brink of extinction. One of the biggest causes of Vaquita mortality is incidental by catch from gill net fishing. There exist several gill net fisheries, legal and illegal, within the habitat range of Vaquita. Shrimp is perhaps the most lucrative of all the legal fisheries but according to many experts it is the illegal totoaba fishery that is driving the Vaquita to the brink of extinction. Totoaba is a fish of the croaker family and it is highly prized for its air bladder which is smuggled to the United States and then shipped to markets in China. It is common knowledge that drug cartels have become involved in this illegal fishery.</p>

<p>Drug cartels are better funded than we are and the strong northwesterly winds of winter make for huge challenges for protecting Vaquita.<br/>
Illegal drug cartel sponsored totoaba fisherman set their nets quickly under the cover of darkness, mark the position with GPS and then rapidly exit the area. These illegal gill nets will stay in the water up to 48 hours or longer. Illegal fisherman will, again under the cover of darkness retrieve their nets. The governmental agency of PROFEPA, Mexico’s version of the Environmental Protection Agency has not only been proven incapable of protecting Vaquita but also accused of taking bribes and regulating illegal fishing within Vaquita habitat. This means that the Mexican navy will now take on a greater role in patrolling the Vaquita Refuge.<br/>
Since 2006 the Mexican military has been mandated to take a greater role in combating drug cartels and drug trafficking. The Mexican military has been called open to do a job it is not trained for. The military has also come under increased criticism for corruption and violation of human rights. Recent revelations show that the military has been mandated to “Bring Down Criminals in Hours of Darkness”. It is also been shown that ex members of the military have been lured into working with drug cartels. It is under this back drop that the small solitary desert porpoise makes its last stand where the once great colorado river now trickles into the Sea of Cortes. The Mexican navy has also come under criticism for allowing illegal fishing practices to take place in marine protected areas. It is crucial that independent non governmental organizations monitor the Mexican navy while it takes on the huge task of protecting Vaquita habitat, which is a huge area that stretches from San Felipe in Baja Norte all the way to Puerto Penasco on the main land in the state of Sonora.<br/>
This drug cartel sponsored illegal fishery is one of the greatest threats to the survival of Vaquita as a species. It will be this activity specifically what WA will be on the look out for. Our 25 years of living in the Sea of Cortes and our past committment to conservation mean we are up to the challenge of patrolling and observing within the Vaquita range of habitat. Please help us make this campaign a reality!</p>

</div>","Short Summary
 

My name is Vince Radice and I am the executive director of the newly formed 501 c3 non profit based in San Carlos, Sonora Mexio called WorldsAqaurium. For the last 15 years we have fought for the protection of marine turtles, whales, dolphins sea lions and sustainable fishing practices in the Sea of Cortes. Our ground breaking documentary “El Oro de Cortes” and the Thallasa TV3 French documentary on our efforts showed government complicity in the illegal dorado fishery in Mexico. 


 

The Mexican government has spent aproximatly 30 million dollars over the last 10 years on Vaquita conservation. Much of that money was unwisely spent. Vaquita are on the brink of extinction. Due to the highly endangered status (Around 60) of the small Vaquita porpoise in the northern gulf region of the Sea of Cortes WorldsAquarium (WA) is funding an independent observer program to monitor the newly enacted governmental ban on gill net fishing with in Vaquita habitat. The Mexican government in conjunction with the international committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA) have welcomed the participation of non governmental organizations (NGO) to actively engage in the observation of the recently installed total gill net ban within the habitat range of the Vaquita.


Where the money goes
The goal is to fund a multi month observation program within the Vaquita range of habitat starting around at the end of November with the goal of extending the program indefinitely, since Vaquita conservation will be a decades long process. WorldsAquarium has two vessels that would work well in the area. One vessel is a shallow drafted 40 foot double A cutter rigged trimaran capable of heavy weather sailing and extended time at sea. The other is a very fast 25 foot super panga with twin 115 horse power four stroke engines. Both these vessels will patrol the Vaquita habitat and be in constant communication with each other.


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Two pairs of night vision googles: one for each vessel: $2000

Two radar units: $5000

Two smart cell phones: $250

One Sat phone: $2500

Four staff members: Two per vessel: Salaries for hired boat hands 10,000 pesos per month for boat hands for two months total of 40,000 pesos or @ $3000 dollars.
100 gallons of gasoline per week for the 25 foot speed boat for 8 weeks for a total of 800 gallons of fuel for a two month observer program. $3000 at 14 pesos per liter.
100 gallons of diesel fuel for our 36 foot Trimaran for two month program $2000 dollars at 30 pesos per gallon.
Provisioning of boats, food and drink $2000

Accommodations in San Felipe. House, apartment or hotel rentals. $1000

Haul out and bottom job for 40 foot trimaran: $1000

Insurance for crew and boats $5000 

miscellaneous expensives spare boat parts oil mechanics fees $2500


Total; $28,700.00 dollars
The Impact
WorldsAquarium has battled the illegal dorado fishery in Mexico for many years now and is intimately familiar with the nature of illegal fishing in the Sea of Cortes. Our determined commitment to conservation over the last decade is well documented.
By funding this campaign you are greatly increasing transparency on the part of the Mexican government and the chances that Mexico will indeed finally take the necessary actions in Vaquita conservation seriously as well as directly aiding in Vaquita recovery in the northern gulf region of the Sea of Cortes.
After 10 years of concentrated conservation effort and approximately 30 million dollars spent the desert porpoise refereed to as La Vaquita is on the brink of extinction. One of the biggest causes of Vaquita mortality is incidental by catch from gill net fishing. There exist several gill net fisheries, legal and illegal, within the habitat range of Vaquita. Shrimp is perhaps the most lucrative of all the legal fisheries but according to many experts it is the illegal totoaba fishery that is driving the Vaquita to the brink of extinction. Totoaba is a fish of the croaker family and it is highly prized for its air bladder which is smuggled to the United States and then shipped to markets in China. It is common knowledge that drug cartels have become involved in this illegal fishery.
Risks & challenges
Drug cartels are better funded than we are and the strong northwesterly winds of winter make for huge challenges for protecting Vaquita.
Illegal drug cartel sponsored totoaba fisherman set their nets quickly under the cover of darkness, mark the position with GPS and then rapidly exit the area. These illegal gill nets will stay in the water up to 48 hours or longer. Illegal fisherman will, again under the cover of darkness retrieve their nets. The governmental agency of PROFEPA, Mexico’s version of the Environmental Protection Agency has not only been proven incapable of protecting Vaquita but also accused of taking bribes and regulating illegal fishing within Vaquita habitat. This means that the Mexican navy will now take on a greater role in patrolling the Vaquita Refuge.
Since 2006 the Mexican military has been mandated to take a greater role in combating drug cartels and drug trafficking. The Mexican military has been called open to do a job it is not trained for. The military has also come under increased criticism for corruption and violation of human rights. Recent revelations show that the military has been mandated to “Bring Down Criminals in Hours of Darkness”. It is also been shown that ex members of the military have been lured into working with drug cartels. It is under this back drop that the small solitary desert porpoise makes its last stand where the once great colorado river now trickles into the Sea of Cortes. The Mexican navy has also come under criticism for allowing illegal fishing practices to take place in marine protected areas. It is crucial that independent non governmental organizations monitor the Mexican navy while it takes on the huge task of protecting Vaquita habitat, which is a huge area that stretches from San Felipe in Baja Norte all the way to Puerto Penasco on the main land in the state of Sonora.
This drug cartel sponsored illegal fishery is one of the greatest threats to the survival of Vaquita as a species. It will be this activity specifically what WA will be on the look out for. Our 25 years of living in the Sea of Cortes and our past committment to conservation mean we are up to the challenge of patrolling and observing within the Vaquita range of habitat. Please help us make this campaign a reality!

I'm a hairstylist by trade and Christophe is the Harbour Master of a small Marina, working in a remote island community near Bella Bella, B.C.  Here is my story!</p><p>Behold, Moonlight Gambler!  </p><p></p><div><div><div><div>
<p>This home built steel boat was the pride and joy of it's creator, Paul Wyatt. He lived on it for years, putting over 40,000 miles of blue water sailing beneath her keels. One of his main goals was to be the oldest man to sail solo and non-stop around the world! As he was preparing for his voyage, a man just a few years older than he had completed the very same dream and had broken the record. Paul took it surprisingly well, biding his time until he was old enough to be the oldest man to circumnavigate. Unfortunately that dream would never be fulfilled. He was diagnosed with cancer and died quite suddenly, so Moonlight Gambler drifted in limbo.  </p>
<p>The rest, I'm afraid, does not get much better. The two step sons inherited the vessel by default, in spite of the fact that they had little desire to sail. It was not longer than a month before she would be hauled out and left to rust in a storage yard. Shortly after that, the brothers began to post ads on various websites in an attempt to sell the boat out from under each other, but due to Moonlight Gambler's strange one-of-a-kind build, there was either little interest or the sellers would not respond to the inquirers.</p>
<p>  My partner and I have been trying to buy this boat for a long time. We tried our best to reach the brothers any time we saw a new ad posted, each time the photos and description of the boat in the ad would give us a false sense of hope. After many attempts to purchase, we were disheartened and finally gave up.</p>
<p>Moonlight Gambler came back into my mind on August 7th. I decided to do a quick Google search to see if anything new came up. I was wide-eyed and had to pick my jaw up from the floor when I read that the boat had been seized by the boatyard and was put up for auction last September. So we called the boat yard where she lies, collecting dust, and spoke to the harbormaster. Moonlight Gambler was still there! When we mentioned her name we could hear a 'groan' over the phone. He went on to explain that the storage payments had stopped and that the yard now had possession. We are working out a reasonable price, though the boat is no longer as sea worthy as she once was. Somebody had broken in to the yard and began to ""part her out"". We called just in time, as the boatyard had been left with no choice but to schedule a demolition date for Moonlight Gambler.  Despite the fact that she is not in top condition, we are still highly motivated to take on this project. Every dollar we procure will go towards restoring what was lost/stolen/neglected. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>She will need many things replaced, as she has been left alone for 7 years and has had all of her gear stripped. Her mast and rudder are missing, and who knows what other ocean-going gear from inside. We hope to head down to where she lies to assess the damage ourselves in the fall. Please help us raise some money to bring her back to the sea where she belongs. When that dream is a reality, we will then live on the boat and sail it up to the central coast of B.C. for yet another working season before we head out into the big blue!</p>
<p> Thank you for reading my story!</p>

So we called the boat yard where she lies, collecting dust, and spoke to the harbormaster. Moonlight Gambler was still there! When we mentioned her name we could hear a 'groan' over the phone. He went on to explain that the storage payments had stopped and that the yard now had possession. We are working out a reasonable price, though the boat is no longer as sea worthy as she once was. Somebody had broken in to the yard and began to ""part her out"". We called just in time, as the boatyard had been left with no choice but to schedule a demolition date for Moonlight Gambler.  Despite the fact that she is not in top condition, we are still highly motivated to take on this project. Every dollar we procure will go towards restoring what was lost/stolen/neglected. 

She will need many things replaced, as she has been left alone for 7 years and has had all of her gear stripped. Her mast and rudder are missing, and who knows what other ocean-going gear from inside. We hope to head down to where she lies to assess the damage ourselves in the fall. Please help us raise some money to bring her back to the sea where she belongs. When that dream is a reality, we will then live on the boat and sail it up to the central coast of B.C. for yet another working season before we head out into the big blue!

<p>In the fall of 2013, I, along with eight other people, will embark on and film a three month long canoe journey down the Mississippi River from the headwaters in Lake Itasca, Minnesota, to New Orleans. As we paddle, we will engage communities in an ongoing dialogue about their relationships to and interactions with this watertrail to give voice to the Mississippi River, its inhabitants, and the many perspectives we encounter along the way. Upon completion of the trip, we will produce a documentary of this journey so that these vital conversations can continue with others beyond the flow of the river.</p>
<p>From my early days as a Clearwater Camper paddling in the Boundary Waters and leading Camp Manito-wish YMCA trips in the Quetico, to extended expeditions on the Yukon and Missinaibi Rivers and guiding inner-city youth in BWCA through Big City Mountaineers, paddling and portaging a canoe is something I love to do. More importantly, though, I strive to expose others to the outdoors in order to build pivotal connections to our natural environment. Through my experiences on rivers and lakes, I've developed a humble appreciation for my dependence on these natural resources. As a Geology student at Colorado College, I took numerous field-based geology courses and wrote grants for independent reseach projets and wilderness trips. I am thrilled to venture down the Mississippi River, engaging with communities who depend on this great resource and educating myself and others about the dependence this river has on us to protect it.</p>
<p>I need your support in order to make this educational adventure a reality!</p>
<h3>
<strong>Why Paddle the Mississippi?</strong> </h3>
<p><span>As the climate debate comes to a head in the United States, it’s easy to get caught up in abstract political jargon and lose sight of the everyday people whose lives revolve around the health of a natural resource. Getting to know community members and share these interactions through the documentary we are making will allow others to get involved in our story.</span></p>
<p>I have always aspired to canoe the entire Mississippi River. At this stage of my life I feel fortunate to be able to seek opportunities like this, and I will work hard to continue inspiring others to strive for similar goals.</p>

<h3>
<strong> </strong><strong>The Impact</strong>
</h3>
<p>Upon returning, we will have the incredible opportunity to construct a local, regional, and national dialogue about the Mississippi River by creating a documentary of our experiences.  This documentary will spark conversations about our natural resources, water usage, the meaning of community, and the very nature of what it means to be ""in nature.""  I will connect with people, share stories, and inspire others to continue spending time outdoors.</p>

<h3> </h3></div>","About the Trip (And Me!)
In the fall of 2013, I, along with eight other people, will embark on and film a three month long canoe journey down the Mississippi River from the headwaters in Lake Itasca, Minnesota, to New Orleans. As we paddle, we will engage communities in an ongoing dialogue about their relationships to and interactions with this watertrail to give voice to the Mississippi River, its inhabitants, and the many perspectives we encounter along the way. Upon completion of the trip, we will produce a documentary of this journey so that these vital conversations can continue with others beyond the flow of the river.
From my early days as a Clearwater Camper paddling in the Boundary Waters and leading Camp Manito-wish YMCA trips in the Quetico, to extended expeditions on the Yukon and Missinaibi Rivers and guiding inner-city youth in BWCA through Big City Mountaineers, paddling and portaging a canoe is something I love to do. More importantly, though, I strive to expose others to the outdoors in order to build pivotal connections to our natural environment. Through my experiences on rivers and lakes, I've developed a humble appreciation for my dependence on these natural resources. As a Geology student at Colorado College, I took numerous field-based geology courses and wrote grants for independent reseach projets and wilderness trips. I am thrilled to venture down the Mississippi River, engaging with communities who depend on this great resource and educating myself and others about the dependence this river has on us to protect it.
I need your support in order to make this educational adventure a reality!

Why Paddle the Mississippi? 
As the climate debate comes to a head in the United States, it’s easy to get caught up in abstract political jargon and lose sight of the everyday people whose lives revolve around the health of a natural resource. Getting to know community members and share these interactions through the documentary we are making will allow others to get involved in our story.
I have always aspired to canoe the entire Mississippi River. At this stage of my life I feel fortunate to be able to seek opportunities like this, and I will work hard to continue inspiring others to strive for similar goals.
What I Need:
food:



Food for one day:


$11

What Do You Get If You Help Fund My Campaign?
$25 – A postcard from the river and big bear hugs.
$100 – Your name featured in the credits of our documentary, a postcard and huge bear hugs.
$500 – A shout-out to you or your organization on our twitter and facebook with a picture of me featuring your name or company, your name featured in the credits of our documentary, a postcard, and polar bear hugs.
$1,000 – A Paddle Forward T-Shirt, photo shout-out, your name in the credits, a copy of the documentary, several postcards from the river, biggest hugs ever, and my eternal gratitude.
$1,500 – A handmade knitted hat with a design of your choice, a Paddle Forward T-Shirt, photo shout-out, your name in the credits, a copy of the documentary, several postcards from the river, most ginormous hugs ever, and my eternal gratitude.

 The Impact

Upon returning, we will have the incredible opportunity to construct a local, regional, and national dialogue about the Mississippi River by creating a documentary of our experiences.  This documentary will spark conversations about our natural resources, water usage, the meaning of community, and the very nature of what it means to be ""in nature.""  I will connect with people, share stories, and inspire others to continue spending time outdoors.

<p><em><strong>In the written words of: </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tony Cerda, Chairman of The Costanoan Rumsen Carmel Tribe of California</strong></em></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 13px;"">
<strong>The Mission of the Costanoan Rumsen Carmel Tribe of California, is to make people around the world aware of the lost Ohlone culture. We propose to do that with the purchase of sacred land of our ancestors at Monterey, California. Once the land is purchased and a model village is built we will extend an invitiation to everyone to come and experience the lost culture of our Ohlone ancestors through story, song, and dance.

<h2><strong><em>OUR GOAL</em></strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>In the written words of: </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tony Cerda, Chairman of The Costanoan Rumsen Tribe of California</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>It has always been the goal of the Costanoan Rumsen Carmel Tribe to return to the sacred land of our Ohlone ancestors and build the first village of the Ohlone. Our ancestors were not as fortunate as other Indigenous people in the rest of the United States who maintained their culture into the early 1900’s. Our culture became extinct when the Spaniards arrived on the shores of California in 1769. I have spent a lifetime researching the village sites of our people. Over the years I would be asked:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>“Why do you spend so much time gathering the history of the Ohlone?”</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>I always tell them: </strong></p>
<p><strong>""To let the world know that at one time a peaceful loving group of Indigenous people lived along the coast of San Francisco Bay through Monterey Bay to the lower Salinas Valley. </strong><strong>Our people had no enemies.""</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHEN THE CONQUERING SPANIARDS ARRIVED WITH A DOCUMENT </strong><strong>(PAPAL BULL) SIGNED BY THE POPE IN ROME, DECLARING THAT ALL NEWLY DISCOVERED LANDS WERE INHABITED BY HEATHENS, THE OHLONE CULTURE CEASE TO EXIST.

<p><strong>You could say: </strong></p>
<h2><strong><em>“That was a long time ago, does it really matter?</em> ""</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>The answer is a resounding YES! </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Yes because it was the Ohlone who contributed their labor and creativity to the advancement of the great state of California. </strong></h3>

<p><em>THE OHLONE WERE MARCHED OFF TO BUILD THE MISSIONS FROM SAN FRANCISCO BAY THROUGH MONTEREY BAY TO THE LOWER SALINAS VALLEY.</em></p>
<h3><strong><em>THE HISTORY</em></strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Ohlone people, also known as Costanoan, are a Native American people of the central and northern California coast. When the Spanish explorers and missionaries arrived in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century, the Ohlone inhabited the area along the coast from San Francisco Bay through Monterey Bay to the lower Salinas Valley. At that time they spoke a variety of languages, the Ohlone languages, belonging to the Costanoan sub-family of the Utian language family, which itself belongs to the proposed Penutian language phylum or stock. The term “Ohlone” has been used in place of “Costanoan” since the 1970’s by some descendant groups and by most ethnographers, historians, and writers of popular literature. Before the Spanish came, the Ohlone lived in more than 50 distinct landholding groups, and did not view themselves as a distinct group.</strong></p>
<p><strong>They survived by hunting, fishing, and gathering, the typical ethnographic California pattern. Originally, the Ohlone religion was Kuksu, but in the years 1769 to 1833, the Spanish Missions in California had a devastating effect on the Ohlone culture. The Ohlone population declined steeply during this period, when the Ohlone were marched off by the Spaniards to build the California missions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ohlone living today belong to one or another of a number of geographically distinct groups, most, but not all, in their original home territory. The Muwekma Ohlone Tribe has members from around the San Francisco Bay area, and is composed of descendants of the Ohlones/Costanoans from the San Jose, Santa Clara, and San Francisco missions. The Ohlone/Costanoan Esselen Nation, consisting of decendants of intermarried Rumsen Costanoan and Esselen speakers of Mission San Carlos Borromeo, are centered at Monterey. The Amah-Mutsun Tribe are decendants of Mutsun Costanoan speakers of mission San Juan Bautista, inland from Monterey Bay. Most members of another group of Rumsen language, decendants from Mission San Carlos, the Costanoan Rumsen Carmel Tribe of Pomona/Chino now living in Southern California. Many of the members have relocated to their ancestral roots in the Monterey Bay area of California.</strong></p>

In the written words of: 
Tony Cerda, Chairman of The Costanoan Rumsen Carmel Tribe of California

The Mission of the Costanoan Rumsen Carmel Tribe of California, is to make people around the world aware of the lost Ohlone culture. We propose to do that with the purchase of sacred land of our ancestors at Monterey, California. Once the land is purchased and a model village is built we will extend an invitiation to everyone to come and experience the lost culture of our Ohlone ancestors through story, song, and dance. The village of the Ohlone will be built the way it was when the Spaniards arrived in 1769. We will build a modern facility that will appear to be an Indigenous dwelling. There we will provide a historical profile of the Ohlone through video, audio, and books. The Redwood sign as you enter the village will forever memorialize the names of the Indiegogo contributors who made it possible to PURCHASE THE LAND AND BUILD THE FIRST OHLONE VILLAGE!

<p><strong>Boodaville started in 2008</strong> with the purchase of 1.5 hectares of olive terraces and pine forests in a stunning, tranquil location. Over the years, many people in an ever-growing international community have become involved and we've learned about, and applied, permaculture design during the development of the site. </p>
<p><strong>The long term goal</strong> is to create a working example of permaculture principles in action, including food production, comfortable rooms for guests and plenty of space for workshops and courses. In a nutshell, permaculture means that we will plan carefully to design hyper-efficient systems which make the most of natural processes, use few external resources, generate very little waste and are considerate of the local and global community. It will be a constantly evolving project as we move as close as possible to being truly sustainable while enabling others to change their own lifestyles and opening minds to alternative ways of seeing the world and relating to it. We see Boodaville as a pilot project to be replicated on small plots of land around the world, and are aware that, especially in Spain since the economic crisis, permaculture is becoming more and more popular.</p>
<p>The initial steps on this journey have already been taken, but ""Think Like a Forest"" will be our first intensive, full-length course. This crowdfunding campaign is designed to raise the funds necessary to fully prepare for the course, move the project forward more quickly and increase our capacity to share ideas and experience with others.</p>
<p><strong>The specific funding aims are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>buy decent tools (including battery power tools, which can be charged on site with solar energy) so volunteers and course participants can work on the site infrastructure efficiently and quickly - £900 apx</li>
<li>buy the materials needed to undergo a practical project during our first full length course in August (the project will either be related to water collection or composting and improving soil quality) £300 apx</li>
<li>develop the infrastructure on site to be able to host 25 people for 7 days. Work includes improving bathrooms and toilets, building more furniture, improving the shade and indoor spaces, extending the range of kitchen equipment (£1000 approx)</li>
</ul>
<div> </div>
<p>(NB - the rest of the 3000 goes towards fees, and the costs involved in providing the perks)</p>

<p>If we pass our funding goal all the extra money will be used towards the longer term goals of the project. Here are some more ways in which we will spend money as soon as we have some!</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay for the environmental impact assessment, which is the next vital step in applying for planning permission for the large building we have planned, where guests will have rooms, bathrooms and an indoor workshop/classroom space. (£700)</li>

<h2>Where we are at now:</h2>
<p>We have really moved forward in the process of preparing for this beautifying, educational and healthy environmental project. Students have spent laborious hours clearing the space and preparing it for the removal of the asphalt.

The soil quality was not up to standards to operate an in ground garden. However, all the positive environmental outcomes of asphalt removal will be met and the PNL 2.0 team is happy with the new plan. We are going back to planters (we will make them out of sustainably harvested cedar wood…) and above ground urban agriculture.  We will still produce high quality food, organic, and local. We will also close the ecosystem loop by producing compost and using it on our beds.</p>

<h3>Why the Indiegogo Campaign?</h3>
<p>The PNL 2.0 team has given itself the goal to have this project completed by September 2013. To do so, we have gathered significant support from the school community and have the benefit of the expertise and help of the professionals at Action Communiterre.</p>
<p>Our base goal is to raise 2500$ with this Indiegogo initiative. However, our total needs have been budgeted at 16500$ of which we have already raised 7000$. We are still expecting to receive answers from a few grant applications we have made (EMSB Green Policy Grant, WWF, Home Depot) and students are hard at work fundraising:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selling raffle tickets for a pair of day passes to Osheaga</li>
<li>Selling PNL Project pins</li>
<li>Offering baked goods and cooked meals for donations at the Green Bean Café</li>
<li>Organizing a clothing exchange and sale “Friperie” style.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your help would top it all up !!</p>
<p><strong>Reaching the 2500$ goal would allow for the following to happen with the help of many volunteer students, parents and neighbours:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Removing, repairing and relocating of the raised planters currently on the space.</li>
<li>Removing of the asphalt and gravel filling underneath by a contractor.</li>
<li>Replacing of the asphalt with organic rich topsoil.</li>
<li>Shaping of the garden beds following permaculture principles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pushing to 3500$ would further the project by allowing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Planting of fruit trees and vines to complement our already existing orchard.</li>
<li>Seeding and planting of edible garden plants (vegetables of all kinds, rice paddies, herb garden, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4500$ is getting us very close to our dream design by allowing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The creation of an outdoor classroom space with flat rock seating and a pergola.</li>
<li>The creation of a landscaped bleachers area where students will be able to enjoy the space and be in contact with nature.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Finally, 5500$ would allow us to reach the final objective:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using the space as a tool for an environmental education program which will include topics such as health education, science, arts, social sciences and extracurricular activities.</li>
<li>Hiring a horticulture expert from Action communiterre to offer animation in the garden for students and community alike.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution would be awesome but it is just one of so many ways you could help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help us get the word out about this campaign. Send this to anyone you know who may be interested in supporting us and local sustainable living. </li>
<li>Join us in the garden as we build our dream (contact us for more details)</li>
<li>Join Action communiterre's membership and start gardening</li>
<li>Donate trees and plants, organic seeds or gardening material</li>
<li>Donate patio furniture for the space</li>
<li>Organize community oriented activites at the PNL</li>
<li>Discuss greening, gardening, food security, health and other issues related to the mission of the PNL project.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Bigger Picture</h3>
<p>The project has multiple environmental, social and educational impacts.</p>
<p>Removing asphalt and replacing it with permeable food production beds will decrease the urban heat island effect, increase water retention and drainage, increase biodiversity, reduce food millage, chemical fertilizers and pesticide use and capture carbon.</p>
<p>Cities are known to be hotter than natural settings because heat radiation becomes particularly intense when the sun’s energy hits the dark bitumen. Also, rain water that falls directly on asphalt rushes down directly to the city’s sewer system. This water sometimes collects chemical pollutants that either have to be treated or are directly dumped into the St-Lawrence river system. Moreover, this causes strain on the water treatment infrastructure, costing the city financial resources. Fostering biodiversity in the city is crucial to the well-being of nature and humans. Having a garden and green space instead of a bitumen desert provides a habitat for species, purifies water and air, controls pests and invasive species and helps attract pollinating insects and birds such as butterflies and hummingbirds. These are very important, free, ecosystem services.</p>
<p>The collective garden network Park n’ Lot is a part of an incredible social experiment. Providing an opportunity for people from the surrounding community to engage in urban agriculture, while working collaboratively with each other and sharing harvested food, the Victory garden network of Action communiterre has proven time and time again that people and plants can help make a community. Targeting people in a situation of food insecurity, using the tools of intergenerational and socio-economic mixity, the Park n’ Lot garden seeks to connect the school with the greater community in one space. Students, adults and elders all worked the raised beds in the past, sharing stories, gardening tips, languages, culture and experiences. The relationship between neighbours and the school has never been as good as it is now, thanks to Park n’ Lot.</p>

<p>Learn, Grow, Share</p>
<p> Action Communiterre is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1997. We are dedicated to raising public awareness about food security and urban agriculture, while improving the community’s access to healthy organic produce through collectively-managed vegetable gardens and other urban agricultural projects in the Montreal area.</p>
<p>Cultivated by a diversity of neighbours, friends and gardening enthusiasts, the Victory Garden Network is a place where people come to learn, grow and share with one another. Gardeners use organic practices, divide the harvest among themselves and share a portion with other neighbourhood groups.</p>
<p>We invite you to come join us in the garden, or start something growing where you live. Together, we can build healthier neighbourhoods and more equitable, sustainable food systems.</p>
<p>Known as the Victory Garden Network in the NDG area, our 10 organic gardens bring local residents of diverse social and economic backgrounds together to garden, learn about food issues and share a portion of their harvest with the community. Five of our collective gardens are animated by knowledgeable staff that provide a variety of activities and workshops on subjects such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organic gardening</li>
<li>Preserving and increasing biodiversity</li>
<li>Recycling &amp; composting</li>
<li>Seed-saving</li>
<li>Balcony gardening</li>
<li>Nutrition</li>
<li>Medicinal plants</li>
<li>Environmental protection and empowerment in food security</li>
<li>Democratic life</li>
<li>Community involvement and the politics of food</li>
</ul>
<p>To raise additional funds, Action Communiterre also offers its expertise to various organizations, businesses and individuals, and sells a large variety of unique heirloom and organic seeds, seedlings and plants.</p>
<p>Most of our gardens offer nature-based activities for children. Fun and educational for the whole family!</p>

Our base goal is to raise 2500$ with this Indiegogo initiative. However, our total needs have been budgeted at 16500$ of which we have already raised 7000$. We are still expecting to receive answers from a few grant applications we have made (EMSB Green Policy Grant, WWF, Home Depot) and students are hard at work fundraising:

Selling raffle tickets for a pair of day passes to Osheaga
Selling PNL Project pins
Offering baked goods and cooked meals for donations at the Green Bean Café
Organizing a clothing exchange and sale “Friperie” style.

Your help would top it all up !!
Reaching the 2500$ goal would allow for the following to happen with the help of many volunteer students, parents and neighbours:

Removing, repairing and relocating of the raised planters currently on the space.
Removing of the asphalt and gravel filling underneath by a contractor.
Replacing of the asphalt with organic rich topsoil.
Shaping of the garden beds following permaculture principles.

Pushing to 3500$ would further the project by allowing:

Planting of fruit trees and vines to complement our already existing orchard.
Seeding and planting of edible garden plants (vegetables of all kinds, rice paddies, herb garden, etc.)

4500$ is getting us very close to our dream design by allowing:

The creation of an outdoor classroom space with flat rock seating and a pergola.
The creation of a landscaped bleachers area where students will be able to enjoy the space and be in contact with nature.

Finally, 5500$ would allow us to reach the final objective:

Using the space as a tool for an environmental education program which will include topics such as health education, science, arts, social sciences and extracurricular activities.
Hiring a horticulture expert from Action communiterre to offer animation in the garden for students and community alike.


 Other Ways You Can Help
Your contribution would be awesome but it is just one of so many ways you could help:

Help us get the word out about this campaign. Send this to anyone you know who may be interested in supporting us and local sustainable living. 
Join us in the garden as we build our dream (contact us for more details)
Join Action communiterre's membership and start gardening
Donate trees and plants, organic seeds or gardening material
Donate patio furniture for the space
Organize community oriented activites at the PNL
Discuss greening, gardening, food security, health and other issues related to the mission of the PNL project.



The Bigger Picture
The project has multiple environmental, social and educational impacts.
Removing asphalt and replacing it with permeable food production beds will decrease the urban heat island effect, increase water retention and drainage, increase biodiversity, reduce food millage, chemical fertilizers and pesticide use and capture carbon.
Cities are known to be hotter than natural settings because heat radiation becomes particularly intense when the sun’s energy hits the dark bitumen. Also, rain water that falls directly on asphalt rushes down directly to the city’s sewer system. This water sometimes collects chemical pollutants that either have to be treated or are directly dumped into the St-Lawrence river system. Moreover, this causes strain on the water treatment infrastructure, costing the city financial resources. Fostering biodiversity in the city is crucial to the well-being of nature and humans. Having a garden and green space instead of a bitumen desert provides a habitat for species, purifies water and air, controls pests and invasive species and helps attract pollinating insects and birds such as butterflies and hummingbirds. These are very important, free, ecosystem services.
The collective garden network Park n’ Lot is a part of an incredible social experiment. Providing an opportunity for people from the surrounding community to engage in urban agriculture, while working collaboratively with each other and sharing harvested food, the Victory garden network of Action communiterre has proven time and time again that people and plants can help make a community. Targeting people in a situation of food insecurity, using the tools of intergenerational and socio-economic mixity, the Park n’ Lot garden seeks to connect the school with the greater community in one space. Students, adults and elders all worked the raised beds in the past, sharing stories, gardening tips, languages, culture and experiences. The relationship between neighbours and the school has never been as good as it is now, thanks to Park n’ Lot.

Action communiterre:

(view website)
Learn, Grow, Share
 Action Communiterre is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1997. We are dedicated to raising public awareness about food security and urban agriculture, while improving the community’s access to healthy organic produce through collectively-managed vegetable gardens and other urban agricultural projects in the Montreal area.
Cultivated by a diversity of neighbours, friends and gardening enthusiasts, the Victory Garden Network is a place where people come to learn, grow and share with one another. Gardeners use organic practices, divide the harvest among themselves and share a portion with other neighbourhood groups.
We invite you to come join us in the garden, or start something growing where you live. Together, we can build healthier neighbourhoods and more equitable, sustainable food systems.
Known as the Victory Garden Network in the NDG area, our 10 organic gardens bring local residents of diverse social and economic backgrounds together to garden, learn about food issues and share a portion of their harvest with the community. Five of our collective gardens are animated by knowledgeable staff that provide a variety of activities and workshops on subjects such as:

Organic gardening
Preserving and increasing biodiversity
Recycling & composting
Seed-saving
Balcony gardening
Nutrition
Medicinal plants
Environmental protection and empowerment in food security
Democratic life
Community involvement and the politics of food

To raise additional funds, Action Communiterre also offers its expertise to various organizations, businesses and individuals, and sells a large variety of unique heirloom and organic seeds, seedlings and plants.
Most of our gardens offer nature-based activities for children. Fun and educational for the whole family!

<p>- to promote Cyprus for overall global recognition, and to be one of the most visited &amp; famous country in Europe;</p>
<p>- to reconnect the modern world with the wonderful aspects of ancient history, focusing primarily on Greek mythology. Visitors will have the opportunity to walk back in time, and learn more about Cyprus history and ancient Greek beliefs and ideals;</p>
<p>- to increase the flow of tourists, which will contribute to the development of such industries as hotel business, tourism, aviation, transport and sea transportation (cruises);</p>
<p>- to provide an opportunity to improve the quality of life of local population, especially in the villages such as Dora, Fasoula, Mamonia, Maronas, Kidasi, in the result improving their nearby environment, and providing more job opportunities.</p>
<p>- to give back to the environment by increasing more green parks and develop undeveloped secluded areas.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We are going to build a statue of Zeus, the father of Gods and king of all Gods in the Greek mythology, thereby we will recover the legendary statue of Zeus, which one was one of the wonders of the ancient world. The wonderful statue was devastated and robbed. To preserve the integrity of the statue, it was transported to Constantinople, where in the V century AD it was finally destroyed during a fire.</p>
<p>The park will also feature a well structured maze for visitors to walk through, where the visitors will have opportunity to see an amazing thing in the centre of the maze.</p>

</h3><p>The <a href=""http://www.lobsterboatblockade.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lobster Boat Blockade</a> has provided an incredible opportunity for the climate movement to pursue a new legal tactic in our effort to push for immediate and dramatic emissions reductions. Ken and Jay are preparing to mount a ""necessity defense"" - potentially the first ever in the US climate movement. This is a powerful opportunity to showcase the seriousness of the climate crisis in a court of law, and put climate change on trial. </p><ul>
<li>
<p>
</p>
<p>Ken and Jay choose to
take this action because they see no alternative - in both practical
political terms and as a moral obligation. Ken
has worked on climate change since 1989, as both a professional
environmentalists and climate activist, and Jay has been an active citizen organizer working on climate since 2008. Neither have been arrested or charged with any crime before, and are good candidates for a watershed trial. </p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making a necessity defense means they admit their action and
argue that the threat of passing the climate change point of no
return is evident and immediate, the contribution of coal burning is
clear-cut, available legal avenues for averting the crisis have been
tried and are inadequate, and therefore, they were justified in taking
action to directly prevent further injury.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Our expert witnesses include Dr. James Hansen, Bill McKibben, and Peter Parenteau and our legal team is headed by accomplished criminal attorney Joan M. Fund and climate legal expert Matt Pawa.</p></li>
<li>This could be the first time that a climate necessity defense is launched in the United States, providing a legal background and encouragement for a renewed wave of direct action around the country.</li>
</ul><p>Could you step in to help this trial succeed as a model for the climate movement around the country?</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fg6-_LtXPaS4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dg6-_LtXPaS4&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fg6-_LtXPaS4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We need to raise $10,000 to ensure that this trial is put to its best use.</p><ul>
<li>Money will be used to pay travel and other expenses for experts testifying at the trial, for communication and documentation of the trial, banners and art supplies for trial festivities, and as a fund to help defray court costs and any fines that are levied.</li>
<li>Check out the awesome perks we have: custom art, dinner with Ken and Jay... or an awesome Life Raft!</li>
<li>In the event that the prosecutors drop the charges, funds will be used to further other climate legal defense work.<br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>
</p><p>
There
are substantial obstacles to presenting a necessity defense, but figuring out how to overcome them is important part of a national
climate strategy. Merely advancing the argument in court will be a
substantial achievement, paving the way for other cases, and provided
a roadmap for use in other trials.</p>
<p>Unlike most attempts to mount necessity
defenses, Ken and Jay have a very strong case. First, there is no question
that we are facing real and imminent danger, with the world's most
credible climate scientist, Jim Hansen to explain, and the recent
report of the UN sanctioned Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
as evidence. 
</p>
<p>
Second, the action was taken with the explicit objective of launching a
regional protest movement aimed at pressing Brayton Point owners and
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to shut the plant down immediately.
The Lobster Boat action did jumpstart a regional protest movement and five months
later, plant owners announced a shutdown. </p><p>Finally, as individuals and
supporters within a broader movement, Ken and Jay have pursued every legal

The Lobster Boat Blockade has provided an incredible opportunity for the climate movement to pursue a new legal tactic in our effort to push for immediate and dramatic emissions reductions. Ken and Jay are preparing to mount a ""necessity defense"" - potentially the first ever in the US climate movement. This is a powerful opportunity to showcase the seriousness of the climate crisis in a court of law, and put climate change on trial. 



Ken and Jay choose to
take this action because they see no alternative - in both practical
political terms and as a moral obligation. Ken
has worked on climate change since 1989, as both a professional
environmentalists and climate activist, and Jay has been an active citizen organizer working on climate since 2008. Neither have been arrested or charged with any crime before, and are good candidates for a watershed trial. 



Making a necessity defense means they admit their action and
argue that the threat of passing the climate change point of no
return is evident and immediate, the contribution of coal burning is
clear-cut, available legal avenues for averting the crisis have been
tried and are inadequate, and therefore, they were justified in taking
action to directly prevent further injury.

Our expert witnesses include Dr. James Hansen, Bill McKibben, and Peter Parenteau and our legal team is headed by accomplished criminal attorney Joan M. Fund and climate legal expert Matt Pawa.
This could be the first time that a climate necessity defense is launched in the United States, providing a legal background and encouragement for a renewed wave of direct action around the country.
Could you step in to help this trial succeed as a model for the climate movement around the country?What We Need & What You GetWe need to raise $10,000 to ensure that this trial is put to its best use.
Money will be used to pay travel and other expenses for experts testifying at the trial, for communication and documentation of the trial, banners and art supplies for trial festivities, and as a fund to help defray court costs and any fines that are levied.
Check out the awesome perks we have: custom art, dinner with Ken and Jay... or an awesome Life Raft!
In the event that the prosecutors drop the charges, funds will be used to further other climate legal defense work.

The Impact

There
are substantial obstacles to presenting a necessity defense, but figuring out how to overcome them is important part of a national
climate strategy. Merely advancing the argument in court will be a
substantial achievement, paving the way for other cases, and provided
a roadmap for use in other trials.
Unlike most attempts to mount necessity
defenses, Ken and Jay have a very strong case. First, there is no question
that we are facing real and imminent danger, with the world's most
credible climate scientist, Jim Hansen to explain, and the recent
report of the UN sanctioned Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
as evidence. 


Second, the action was taken with the explicit objective of launching a
regional protest movement aimed at pressing Brayton Point owners and
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to shut the plant down immediately.
The Lobster Boat action did jumpstart a regional protest movement and five months
later, plant owners announced a shutdown. Finally, as individuals and
supporters within a broader movement, Ken and Jay have pursued every legal
avenue open to them to avert this crisis. They have lobbied, litigated, organized, campaigned, raised the issue in
the electoral arena, promoted alternatives, educated the public and
taken other actions to zero effect. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute money, that doesn’t mean you can’t help:

<h3>Why we need your support</h3>
<p>The regulator has released the Bermuda Better Energy Plan for public consultation. <strong>This may be the only chance</strong> to show that it is supported by the people of Bermuda. We have already invested considerable resources into developing the Better Energy Plan. We need your help so we can continue to: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Develop the technical and economic feasibility</strong> - there are opportunities to make elements of the plan even more robust. Estimated budget: $4,000</li>
<li>
<strong>Promote the plan in Bermuda</strong> to ensure the consultation gets widespread support. Estimated budget: $2,500</li>
<li>
<strong>Answer technical questions and explain the plan in person </strong>- we would like to engage with the regulator, the energy company and the community to make sure the plan works for everyone. Estimated budget: $3,500</li>
<li>
<strong>Bring technical experts to Bermuda</strong> - we would like to bring experts in offshore wind and energy storage from abroad. Estimated budget: $7,000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your help could change the direction of Bermudian energy generation forever</strong>. This is a unique opportunity to help Bermuda use her own energy resources, drastically cut carbon emissions, and make electricity more affordable.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Bermuda's energy regulator has asked the island's power company, BELCO, to submit a plan for the future of electricity generation on the island. The plan that has been released proposes continuing to generate electricity primarily from expensive and polluting imported fossil fuels. Fortunately, Bermuda's laws provide an important opportunity to influence BELCO's plan by allowing other organisations to submit alternative plans.</p>
<p>Bermuda Engineering Company Limited (BE Solar) commissioned UK sustainability firm Etude to prepare a more sustainable plan: the <strong>Bermuda Better Energy Plan</strong>. This plan maximises use of Bermuda's own abundant renewable energy rather than imported fossil fuel. Your support will greatly increase the chance that the energy regulator asks BELCO to update their original plan to include aspects of the Bermuda Better Energy Plan, by enabling us to continue our work to develop, communicate and promote the plan. If we are successful this will lead to a fantastic change through which <strong>energy efficiency</strong>, <strong>solar panels</strong>, <strong>offshore wind</strong> and <strong>energy storage</strong> all contribute to a <strong>massive reduction in CO2 emissions of more than 60% by 2038</strong>.</p>
<p>This would also result in less money being spent on energy imports, more local jobs in renewable energy and more money for Bermuda’s local economy. It is preparing the island for the future and will help to produce more affordable clean electricity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we can offer</h3>

Kersey Lawrence and Lee Gutteridge make a dynamic and knowledgeable team and will guide us through our exploration and the many regions of South Africa that they call home.  Lee is the author of six South African natural history books to date and is one of only 10 FGASA Scout Guides (the highest qualification that can be earned). Kersey, a PhD candidate at UCONN and an award-winning educator, is the only female Senior Tracker in the world.Our group will be focused on wildlife ecology, tracking, and human culture in Southern Africa. This adventure will last for 15 days/14 nights, from August 3rd to the 17th. Our group will be staying in two locations within Kruger National Park. Each one a special environment different than the other.  Our daily activities will include GIS mapping, data collection, track casting, track and sign evaluation, camera trapping, presentations, night drives, astronomy sessions, journaling, and SO much more.  Because our camps are immersed within the South African wildlife we will be highly exposed to all it has to offer. With Safari experiences both in vehicles and on foot, we will be able to apply our learned field techniques in action.

Ils sont coûteux, encombrants, énergivores, souvent superflus, très partiellement triés et recyclés, et même ceux qui le sont, redeviennent pour beaucoup des déchets problématiques à la fin de leur cycle de vie. Seuls le verre et les métaux se recyclent à l'infini, avec un coût économique et environnemental que l'on oublie trop facilement.

En Méditerranée, on estime à </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">115 000 particules par km2 les déchets qui la contaminent(1).

J'ai fondé l'association <a href=""http://legerlocal.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2L Léger&amp;Local</a> en 2010, avec un petit groupe de convaincus, et l'objectif principal d'accompagner les producteurs, distributeurs et commerçants dans la réduction des déchets à la source, et en particulier des emballages jetables. Dans ce cadre, j'ai travaillé tous les aspects de la vente en vrac et en consigné : réglementaire, technique, logistique, marketing, y compris le design de solutions de distribution de produits liquides. Après plusieurs années au service des professionnels, nous avons fait plusieurs constats:</div><div><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">un panel important de citoyen-ne-s consommateur-rice-s est prêt et même en attente d'une offre de produits courants sans emballages jetables;</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">ce type d'offre implique un changement conséquent dans la gestion d'un commerce, et donc un investissement que les commerces déjà en place n'ont pas forcément la possibilité ou craignent de faire dans le contexte précaire actuel; </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">les producteurs et distributeurs sont eux-mêmes soumis aux standards des commerces existants et ne peuvent investir dans une offre vrac et/ou consignée tant qu'il n'y a pas suffisamment de demandes.</span>
</li>
</ul></div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><b>En conclusion, il est apparu qu'à ce stade, pour faire avancer notre cause, il fallait choisir L'EXEMPLARITÉ. Faire nous-mêmes la démonstration de la faisabilité de ce mode de consommation.

LE PREMIER COMMERCE 100% SANS EMBALLAGES JETABLES EN PROVENCE... où vous trouverez DES PRODUITS LOCAUX DE QUALITÉ - produits alimentaires, d'hygiène et d'entretien - À DES PRIX ACCESSIBLES, vendus AU POIDS DANS DES CONTENANTS RÉUTILISABLES CONSIGNÉS, ou dans ceux que vous apporterez avec vous... 




 

LE PREMIER BAR/ÉPICERIE EN FRANCE OU VOUS POURREZ FAIRE REMPLIR VOS BOUTEILLES AU COMPTOIR de vins, de jus, mais aussi de sodas et de bières fraîches... 







UN LIEU CONVIVIAL OÙ FAIRE SES COURSES AVEC PLAISIR, au milieu des couleurs, des saveurs et des matières brutes... Un lieu lumineux et chaleureux en centre ville OÙ S'ARRÊTER, SE RETROUVER, DISCUTER autour d'un verre et de gourmandises, EN FRANÇAIS, MAIS AUSSI EN ANGLAIS, EN ESPAGNOL, plus autres langues marseillaises que vous y apporterez. Un lieu au-delà des étiquettes,  ouvert au mélange des genres. 









L'INNOVATION, L'UTILITÉ SOCIALE ET ENVIRONNEMENTALE, mais aussi LE GOÛT, LE PLAISIR, LA CULTURE DU QUOTIDIEN... En bref, UNE SENSIBILISATION JOYEUSE.






Les déchets d'emballages, y en a marre


Les emballages débordent... Ils sont coûteux, encombrants, énergivores, souvent superflus, très partiellement triés et recyclés, et même ceux qui le sont, redeviennent pour beaucoup des déchets problématiques à la fin de leur cycle de vie. Seuls le verre et les métaux se recyclent à l'infini, avec un coût économique et environnemental que l'on oublie trop facilement. Partout, dans le monde se répandent les débris de nos emballages plastique, polluant les espaces naturels, terre et mer, jusqu'aux océans. En Méditerranée, on estime à 115 000 particules par km2 les déchets qui la contaminent(1). Or la Région Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur fait figure de cancre du tri et du recyclage, bien en-dessous de la moyenne nationale, les chiffres les plus bas revenant au département des Bouches du Rhône. A Marseille même, il suffit de se promener dans le centre ville pour constater l'incroyable quantité de bouteilles, canettes, pots et autres emballages qui débordent des poubelles destinées à l'incinération, et même des caniveaux ! 

C'est dire l'urgence d'agir, ici, dans ce département et cette région, pour changer les comportements.

Le pari du Bar à Vrac : innovation écologique et création d'emplois durables
Selon l'adage ""le meilleur déchet est sans conteste celui qui n'est pas produit"", et les constats listés ci-dessus, incluant les spécificités locales, le Bar à Vrac relève ainsi le défi de sensibiliser un éventail le plus large possible de marseillais-e-s et par extension de producteurs, distributeurs et commerçants de la région - à la consommation de produits locaux sans emballages jetables.
Nous n'inventons rien mais proposons de remettre au centre la valeur
fondamentale du produit et en périphérie de celui-ci la
valeur d'usage des emballages. La réutilisation des emballages est
le seul moyen au coût énergétique le plus faible, de rallonger le
cycle de vie de quantité de matières dont très peu sont
effectivement recyclées.

De l'association     au Bar à Vrac




J'ai fondé l'association 2L Léger&Local en 2010, avec un petit groupe de convaincus, et l'objectif principal d'accompagner les producteurs, distributeurs et commerçants dans la réduction des déchets à la source, et en particulier des emballages jetables. Dans ce cadre, j'ai travaillé tous les aspects de la vente en vrac et en consigné : réglementaire, technique, logistique, marketing, y compris le design de solutions de distribution de produits liquides. Après plusieurs années au service des professionnels, nous avons fait plusieurs constats:

un panel important de citoyen-ne-s consommateur-rice-s est prêt et même en attente d'une offre de produits courants sans emballages jetables;


ce type d'offre implique un changement conséquent dans la gestion d'un commerce, et donc un investissement que les commerces déjà en place n'ont pas forcément la possibilité ou craignent de faire dans le contexte précaire actuel; 


les producteurs et distributeurs sont eux-mêmes soumis aux standards des commerces existants et ne peuvent investir dans une offre vrac et/ou consignée tant qu'il n'y a pas suffisamment de demandes.

En conclusion, il est apparu qu'à ce stade, pour faire avancer notre cause, il fallait choisir L'EXEMPLARITÉ. Faire nous-mêmes la démonstration de la faisabilité de ce mode de consommation. Nous possédons le savoir, mettons le au service direct des citoyen-ne-s :  ainsi est née l'idée du Bar à Vrac.


Seulement, cette nouvelle aventure ayant une dimension économique et commerciale bien plus poussée que la mission d'origine de l'association, le CA de 2L m'a encouragée à m'y lancer seule, en créant une société. 
Portrait 
Mon nom est Nathalie Boudé. Je vis à Marseille et vais fêter mes 50 ans dans quelques jours. Je suis divorcée, j'ai trois enfants, et j'élève encore le plus jeune - 11 ans. J'ai toujours travaillé sur ou autour d'initiatives citoyennes qui me paraissaient importantes et qui me donnaient envie de me battre pour elles, D'abord comme journaliste et photographe, ensuite comme chargée de projets / missions. Au fil des années, j'ai créé trois associations, j'ai été élue municipale, et je suis l'auteure de l'ouvrage Les Bâtisseurs de la Marge. Ayant consacré ces dernières années à 2L Léger&Local, passant de salariée à bénévole à temps plein, selon les ressources de l'association, je suis aujourd'hui demandeure d'emploi non rémunérée.
Le Bar à Vrac représente, pour moi, à la fois une mission d'utilité sociale et environnementale, un beau challenge, la valorisation de l'expertise acquise à travers les années investies dans 2L, sans compter mon temps, mon énergie et mes revenus, mais aussi la création d'emplois durables. Création d'emplois directe au sein de ce commerce, mais aussi indirecte via l'effet boule de neige que notre initative devrait provoquer : soutien de producteurs, reproduction du modèle !!! 
       

Pourquoi j'ai besoin de vous et ce que je peux vous offrir

J'ai besoin de 20 000 € pour constituer un apport personnel suffisant à hauteur de 30% du montant des besoins en investissement et en trésorerie de démarrage, afin que les organismes et une banque me suivent. Les besoins au démarrage s'élèvent à plus de 60 000€ en comptant un droit au bail moyen de 25 000€. Sans cet apport personnel, aucun des trois types de prêt d'investissement que je m'apprête à solliciter - prêt d'honneur, Nacre, bancaire - ni aucune garantie - Fonds de Garantie à l'Initiative des Femmes - ne me seront attribués pour monter ce commerce. 
Etant donné ma situation personnelle, j'ai besoin de vous pour faire levier sur les financements classiques. 
Je peux vous offrir en contrepartie :

Un immense merci;
la satisfaction de contribuer à un projet écologiquement et socialement très utile et d'avoir votre nom inscrit en toutes lettres sur le mur du Bar en Vrac;
un gros bisou de la créatrice;
votre nom sur le mur du Bar en Vrac;
Un café ou un verre avec le sourire;
De 1 à 4 contenants réutilisables;
Un kit complet découverte du Bar à Vrac rempli de bons produits;
Des bons de réduction de 10 à 20% sur vos premiers achats;
Un photo-tour découverte de Marseille en compagnie d'un photographe professionel;
Un repas sur l'une des bonnes terrasses marseillaises;
Une nuit ou un week-end complet dans un charmant 3 pièces avec terrasse dans le ciel et vue sur le port de Marseille, pour vous, en couple, en famille ou entre amis.






L'impact



Votre aide est capitale pour moi, vous l'avez compris, et ce quel qu'en soit le montant ! Si je n'atteins pas l'objectif des 20 000€, j'utiliserais quand même chaque euro donné pour obtenir mes prêts.  Je devrais en réduire les montants mais je démarrerais, y compris avec moins de produits.

Votre aide est capitale pour Marseille et ses habitants fatigués de vivre dans un environnement où les déchets d'emballages font partie du paysage.Donnons leur des alternatives, ouvrons de nouvelles perspectives. Si un bar/épicerie sans embllages jetables ouvre et remporte le succès escompté, d'autres suivront.
Votre aide est capitale pour la Provence et la Méditerranée, d'une part parce bon nombre d'emballages jetés ici finissent à l'incinération, à l'enfouissement, ou à la mer. D'autre part, parce que si nous parvenons à changer les comportements, ne serait-ce que d'une minorité, à Marseille, l'idée essaimera sur le territoire.

</div></div>","Think we can lessen our impact on the environment by having more fun?  Then it’s time to learn about Operation Green Fun!

We are 20-somethings, 30, 40, and 50-somethings.  We are entrepreneurs and students.  We are men.  We are women.  We are from the east and from the west. We all have different skills and believe we can come together and make a difference by promoting environmentally friendly, fun products that need a little push to gain the traction needed to effect great positive change.  Our first focus:



What if there was a cup that was so cool and fun, that nobody would throw it away, and even if they no longer wanted it, could be recycled instead of trashed?  
What if you could easily play a part in reducing all this cup waste?There is, and you can!  By participating in our campaign, you help give away thousands of reusable and 100% recyclable, handle-stacking cups to bars, restaurants, venues or organizations that use traditional throwaway cups to serve beverages.  For every 210 cups funded, we’ll ship a case of these fun, eco-friendly cups, to the top vote getter, free of charge!  Best of all, you get to help decide who receives them!  We’ll even reward you with prizes, including cups of your own!  
  Where the Funds Go:



What You Get:















**For every $3 contributed without a reward claim, we'll add another cup to the donation pool**

The Impact:

  



If we reach or exceed our funding goal, for every 210 cups donated, we’ll put a case up for vote. Our funders will decide which bars, restaurants (or other venues that serves beverages) will receive them.  If we can distribute enough cases, and customers of the establishments who receive them, like the product, the consuming public will have an opportunity to reduce the number of disposable cups in our landfills by millions in the USA.Links:See the environmental impact potential here.

Case Study #1 - Central Park Festival
Case Study #2 - Coco Bar
Case Study #3 - SuperSports Park Stadium

<p><b>The current climate crisis is urgent, but solutions to address it already exist: small-scale farmers can cool the planet as they feed the world. Contribute now to help us at Fair World Project spread this message of hope and promote critical work!</b></p>
<p><b>With your contributions, we’ll distribute a new image created by political artist, Favianna Rodriguez especially for this campaign and complete and distribute our short documentary, featuring Vandana Shiva and other food sovereignty luminaries, on how small-scale farmers can mitigate climate change through regenerative organic agriculture.</b></p>
<p>Fair World Project works to create a just economy that respects our environment and treats all people with dignity. This requires conscious production and conscious consumption. We believe education is the way to get there and are dedicated to spreading big ideas that support key projects in this endeavor.</p>
<p>Small-scale regenerative organic farming uses widely available and inexpensive methods. If we switched all agricultural practices to follow this model, greenhouse gas emissions that propel climate change could be significantly reduced and we could sequester 100% of current carbon dioxide emissions. But to do it, we need to stand with small farmers. To achieve a critical mass of support, we need to get the word out.</p>

Your contribution              will help us make this dream a reality. What is the Bentley blockade all about?Coal Seam Gas (CSG) and other forms of unconventional gas mining and the use of hydraulic fracking threatens so much; the land, the air, the water, the people and the health of all living things that require clean elements for survival. We believe that every single gas well (and there can be thousands of them in a relatively small area) contaminates the environment. Recently NSW EPA fined a company drilling in the nearby Pilliga    State Forest for contaminating an underground water aquifer with    uranium, lead and arsenic. From the gasfield horror in the USA to the town of Tara in Southern Queensland in Australia, the impacts are very real indeed, devastating almost every other existing industry. The community has tried everything, from lobbying local politicians at all forms and levels of government. Northern Rivers area has been surveyed door to door with an overwhelming result in most areas being between 90 to 100% against gasfield development. 87% voted no to CSG at the local referendum in Lismore. All that is left to us is to put our bodies on the line in non violent direct action.Our Goal and what we need:To Raise $11,000 for a portable medium sized solar system so we can cover our electrical power needs. We don't want to be pumping fumes into the atmosphere and chucking dollars at petrol stations.  By supporting renewables at Bentley  you will help us show the world that we can ""walk the talk"" and don't need to use fossil fuel to oppose    a gas field.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The main goal of the first Greening Villages Project is to support a social agricultural cooperative which works on Italian land confiscated from the mafia, by providing this community with a renewable energy installation. It's a <strong>win-win situation</strong>! By supporting our project, you will be contributing to fostering a model that can help villages in the world become more environmentally and economically sustainable. We would sincerely appreciate your support and reward you with quality organic-products from the social cooperative in Southern Italy. If our first project succeeds, it will pave the way for future projects. We are not lacking in enthusiasm or ideas. We just need support to realize our goals.</p>
<p>Greening Villages is a young and ambitious start-up, focused on providing the comprehensive needs of agricultural cooperatives and farms in the full range of energy production and consumption, as well as community forest management. Greening Villages will be able to offer an “ad hoc” solution to every client in order to reach the highest possible level of energy efficiency and economic and social development. Our company is promoting a new business trend that incorporates a strong social element. Our work has the goal to develop itself in two very close business areas - ecopreneurship and social entrepreneurship.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The cooperation between “Greening Villages” and the agricultural cooperative “Cooperativa Sociale Terre di Puglia – Libera Terra” will contribute to achieving several significant benefits. To learn more about the social Cooperative, please visit their website <a href=""http://www.hisotelaray.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.hisotelaray.it</a>. The main portion of the “greening villages” project is the installation of solar panels on the roof of a warehouse. The warehouse will be built to store agricultural tools while the roof will be used as a firm surface for installing solar panels. An additional benefit is that no valuable agricultural land will be used for the solar panel installation. Through the solar panel installation, the agricultural cooperative will be supplied with more electricity for its needs, which can also boost the production of organic agricultural products. Moreover, the surplus of produced electrical energy can be sold to the national smart grid, and generate additional income. In this way, the Cooperative will be able to offer more job positions thanks to the production boost, which in turn will increase activities combating the social structures built by the Mafia in the area. </p>

<div class=""section"">Our campaign goal is to raise <strong>77.000 $</strong> in order to be able to complete the first phase of our project which consists of building a warehouse.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>If we reach the amount of <strong>116.000 $</strong>, we are going to be able to build the warehouse including buying all the materials for the solar modules installation, as well as the modules themselves.</p>
<p>If we reach the amount of <strong>155.000 $</strong>, we are going to be able to build the warehouse, buy the necessary materials, install the modules on the roof of the warehouse and conduct social research covering all the costs through your support.</p>
<p>If these goals are not reached, it will be necessary for us to find other funding resources (such as EU funds or Italian funding resources). Otherwise, it will be necessary to use conventional financial institutions. In the latter case, the Cooperative would need to spend the money earned through the solar technology to pay back the credit, and money could be better spent to fight mafia rather than loan payments.</p>
<p>We definitely need your support, but we would also like to show sincere gratitude for your interest, time and support. That is why we have prepared various organic products from the social cooperative as small rewards for your valuable support. </p>
<p>If we don’t reach our funding goal, all the money raised will be saved until the next crowd funding campaign, or until another funding resource (such as EU regional funds etc.) is provided. We are aware that our project is complex and consists of many phases for which funds have to be raised. However, we don’t lack motivation and patience to complete it by combining different funding strategies. </p>

<p><strong>Thank you very much</strong> in advance! We cannot describe you how much we appreciate your support because this project is much more than it looks.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The project should bring a better future for the agricultural cooperative and the people living in the village of San Pietro Vernotico in a social, economic and environmental context. One of the goals is to provide finances for <strong>renovating the villa of an ex mafia boss</strong>, which is now given for use by the Cooperative. The Cooperative plans to renovate the villa and convert it to a place where different events with educational initiatives take place. That way a positive sign will be given to the people of the community. The point is to strengthen the community’s cohesion and trust,<strong> reduce the fear of the mafia</strong> that many people living in the community still have, as well as to raise awareness about environmental issues. By <strong>enhancing the demand for organic products</strong> and <strong>showing the benefits from solar energy</strong>, the project will achieve its main goal – showing everyone that eco-friendly practices can be <strong>socially beneficial <em>and</em> profitable</strong>.   </p>
<p>The goal of our project is to improve environmental, social and economic conditions and the general quality of life and living in San Pietro Vernotico. We chose the challenging rural community of San Pietro Vernotico to implement our projects and <strong>create a change</strong>.</p>
<p>An innovative element introduced by “Greening Villages” is the funding concept, as well as the social research following the technology installation.</p>
<p>We know that agricultural cooperatives in disadvantaged regions don’t have enough funds to invest in renewable energies, or for tackling the social problems which affect the area they are settled in. One method to support them is by providing financing from different resources such as from international organizations, corporate sponsorships, and crowd funding. Each of our projects is tailor-made for the needs of the target community, based on in-depth analysis and site visits.</p>
<p>Moreover, an analysis that incorporates environmental, social and economic aspects follows the project implementation. After installation of the solar panels, Greening Villages will conduct qualitative research study to investigate how this change has affected the community. The research will focus on the community’s perception about the Cooperative, the community’s relationship with the Mafia, and the community’s relationship with the Cooperative itself. Greening Villages will then be able to provide the Cooperative with ideas on how to use their earnings from the resale of their energy. The use of this income must be reinvested to enhance social and economic development in benefit of the local community. This is mandated not only by the Cooperative’s statute, but also by Italian law. Our focus is on <strong>offering jobs</strong> related to the solar panels, while also attempting to solve the difficulties the Cooperative faces concerning social acceptance within the community.</p>
<p>The Mafia has been using agriculture as a way to offer jobs, as well as to control people. Next to <strong>raising awareness</strong>, confiscation is a very efficient method to defeat criminal organizations, as well as the reusing of the land for socially beneficial projects. Regarding raising awareness, “Libera Terra” organizes international community service work camps annually. As a result, volunteers have the chance to experience and directly support a daily, <strong>non-violent fight against the Mafia</strong>. Our installation is implemented to help the Cooperative in its fight against the criminal organizations and their social consequences on the territory.</p>
<p>By implementing the project, we create a basis for the community for further improvement. One of our goals is to show them that change can happen if the effort and motivation exist, even if one doesn’t possess the funds. We don’t only provide communities with technology, but we also inspire and enable them!</p>

</h3>In
today’s age of global warming, where the temperature in the tropics is reaching
extremes in various seasons, I am constantly reminded of our responsibility towards
preserving nature for our own comfortable living and for the future. Hence, starting
this rainy season (July 2014), we are launching a project to plant and maintain
indigenous trees in open spaces around the BHEL Township in Hyderabad.<br/><br/><h3>Context</h3><p></p>
<p>The United Nations Food &amp; Agriculture organization
estimates that about 13 million hectares of forests disappear each year due to human
activity<a href=""#_ftn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></a>
(read: deforestation). In India alone, the annual deforestation rate is
estimated to be 294 thousand hectares<a href=""#_ftn2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[2]</span></span></span></a>,
which translates to 1,130 football fields of loss of tree-cover every day.</p>
<p>For
most of us, this is just a statistic. But on a more conscious assessment, many of
us have a tangible memory of seeing the reduction in tree cover around us. Booming
real-estate prices have transformed land into an expensive commodity, ensuring
use of every inch of available space for construction and not leaving place for
any trees to grow. Speculators have bought land that was earlier under
cultivation, and either constructed buildings or left them barren. In the past
25 years, BHEL, a small township of 2,000 households which was surrounded by
dense forest and green farm lands is now completely destroyed by the sprawling
city of Hyderabad. There is now a concrete
jungle all around that township along with a population increase of few hundred
thousand.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/591371/files/20140520022145-Urban_Sprawl.JPG?1400577705"" src="""" style=""""/></p>** Map showing densely built-up area around BHEL township<br/><p></p><p>Thankfully, the township itself belongs to a public-sector industry,
Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), and still houses less than 2,000
households, retaining much of the greenery that existed many years ago. One can
clearly experience the impact of having the greenery as one enters or exits the

<h3></h3><h3>Project Objectives<br/>
</h3><p></p>
<p>Every rainy season, governments across the country undertake
mass plantation of saplings but the survival rates are near zero. Without any
arrangements for maintenance and care of the saplings, or for local community engagement in the
effort, such exercises become mere rituals to satisfy statutory needs rather
than create true greenery. </p>
<p>Hence, the current campaign is not designed for mass plantation
but will focus on planting and providing care for a few hundred indigenous trees.
Depending on the type of tree, it may take anywhere between 3 and 10 years of
support before the trees are able to grow by themselves. While doing so, the
campaign aims for the following ancillary activities that shall enrich the
exercise:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Undertake solid-waste management by way of
composting bio-degradable waste from households and vegetable markets in the
surroundings of where these saplings are planted.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Provide necessary information and assistance for
those households interested in undertaking composting within their own plots.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Engage in rain-water harvesting to improve the
ground-water level, thus possibly reducing the need to transport water for the
trees at times of low/no rainfall.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Encourage community participation, primarily
that of children and youth, providing an opportunity to learn and create a
connect with nature, so that they may take up similar activities independently,
to create scale. </li>
<li>

Conduct events and competitions to provide
opportunity see, learn and showcase/share stories of individual achievements in
reducing waste.</li>
</ul><h3><br/></h3><h3>What
Kind of Trees Will be Planted?</h3><p></p>As
mentioned earlier, only indigenous trees of at least 25 different varieties
shall be planted during the months of July – September 2014. A variety of
plants will be chosen which will have varying growth rates. About 20% - 30% of
the trees will be of edible fruit-bearing varieties so that the harvesting
season becomes a means of observation, learning and celebration for the people
involved. Most other trees have medicinal value. Almost all of them grow into
large trees and provide shade under them. Below are a few trees that grow in
this area.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/629690/files/20140606001724-Types_of_Trees_-1b.JPG?1402039044"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>** Indigenous tree varieties from this area (clockwise from top left: Gulmohar,  Jack Fruit, Rain Tree, Neem, Peepal, Eucalyptus, Tamarind, Black Plum, Cluster Fig, Copper Pod, Neem Chameli)<br/><br/><br/><h3>Where
&amp; When?</h3><p></p>
<p>Except for a few fruit bearing trees, most others, hopefully
will grow into large canopies that provide shade and beauty to the
surroundings. Typically, about 70 to 100 trees can occupy an acre of open
space. Thus, the 800 saplings that will be planted as part of this campaign are
expected to spread over 10 acres of open land. However, as mentioned earlier,
the township and its surrounding areas already retain some greenery. Hence, the
open spaces are not contiguous. Some spaces are just enough for ten saplings
while others are large enough for fifty trees to be planted. Hence, these saplings
will be spread in multiple nearby locations in and around BHEL Township in
Hyderabad.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/594222/files/20140521045753-Open_Waste_Lands.JPG?1400673473"" src="""" style=""""/></p>** Open lands spread with debris, dirt and asthma causing weed<br/><p></p><p>The ground work on the project will start shortly after the
first monsoon rains, which typically arrive mid-June. Planting of saplings will
continue from the month of July through September. Starting October 2014, an
outreach exercise will be initiated with the local households to segregate
their household waste such that the boo-degradable kitchen waste shall be
composted in pits around the saplings. This will reduce the solid-waste
generated from households which otherwise gets dumped in open landfills, while
at the same time making the soil fertile and assisting in better plant growth. This entire process is expected to be streamlined
by March 2015 and will continue for at least 5 years by when the trees will
grow enough, needing very little support.</p>

The current fund-raising effort is only towards
the cost of managing the program for a period of 12 months. After the first
year, the resource requirement for caring for the plants will be much lower. Attempts
will be made to raise small funds locally or to get households to adopt some
plants to continue the program for future years. Further outreach exercise will
be undertaken to motivate neighborhood to replicate this model into newer
areas to achieve scale.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Putting
the Funds to Good Use:</h3><p></p>
<p>The current campaign aims to raise $16,000 towards the costs
of managing the program for one full year. These funds will be applied towards:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Procuring saplings from local nurseries.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Employing four to five daily workers for
clearing the debris, preparing the pits, planting saplings, watering them, creating
enclosures to secure them from animals, collecting degradable waste,
composting, etc. </li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Watering of plants. For the most part, water
needed for the saplings will be collected from the houses nearby. However, this
may not be possible for all the plants, and also during the summer months when
the water is scarce. </li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Creating temporary fences made of bamboo and
cloth to protect them from animals. Some of these may need replacement over the
period of the year.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Purchase of tools for earthwork and also for a
push-cart for collecting waste for composting.</li>
</ol>

The funds raised from this Indiegogo campaign
will not be used for any administrative expenditure or for creation of any
fixed infrastructure. The campaign managers shall
contribute $150 - $200 per month for the one year period towards administrative
expenditure (accounting, communication, transport, documentation, etc.), apart
from our time supervising the work and participating in physical labor. Hence,
as a contributor to this project, you can be assured that every dollar donated
by you is used to create a better environment, while also generating employment
for the underprivileged.<br/><br/><h3>

<p>The project is fully

<li>
<span><span></span></span>Running education programs for children to

In
today’s age of global warming, where the temperature in the tropics is reaching
extremes in various seasons, I am constantly reminded of our responsibility towards
preserving nature for our own comfortable living and for the future. Hence, starting
this rainy season (July 2014), we are launching a project to plant and maintain
indigenous trees in open spaces around the BHEL Township in Hyderabad.Context
The United Nations Food & Agriculture organization
estimates that about 13 million hectares of forests disappear each year due to human
activity[1]
(read: deforestation). In India alone, the annual deforestation rate is
estimated to be 294 thousand hectares[2],
which translates to 1,130 football fields of loss of tree-cover every day.
For
most of us, this is just a statistic. But on a more conscious assessment, many of
us have a tangible memory of seeing the reduction in tree cover around us. Booming
real-estate prices have transformed land into an expensive commodity, ensuring
use of every inch of available space for construction and not leaving place for
any trees to grow. Speculators have bought land that was earlier under
cultivation, and either constructed buildings or left them barren. In the past
25 years, BHEL, a small township of 2,000 households which was surrounded by
dense forest and green farm lands is now completely destroyed by the sprawling
city of Hyderabad. There is now a concrete
jungle all around that township along with a population increase of few hundred
thousand.** Map showing densely built-up area around BHEL townshipThankfully, the township itself belongs to a public-sector industry,
Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), and still houses less than 2,000
households, retaining much of the greenery that existed many years ago. One can
clearly experience the impact of having the greenery as one enters or exits the
township on a summer day; the ambient temperature just inside the boundary is 3
to 4 degrees cooler than just 100 feet outside the township.

Armed with some research equipment, a video camera, and a solid pair of hiking boots, I had arrived in Thailand to begin my PhD research and was moving into the jungle to study primates at UNESCO World Heritage Site, Khao Yai National Park. It was the start of my biggest adventure to date.<br/><br/>The for next two years I would live with Thai locals as the only foreign researcher in one of Thailand’s largest, and most celebrated, protected rainforests. And relying only on the kindness of strangers, I had to learn the local language fast and figure out how things worked to make new friends in order to survive so far away from <br/>home.<br/><br/>I documented my journey in this blog (<a href=""http://www.blogpsot.com/primejm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.prime-jm.blogspot.com</a>) for my friends and family to read, but soon the blog grew into a more meaningful enterprise. An audience was building of students and interested readers looking to learn more about the animals I study, my relationships with the Thai locals in a foreign culture, and my experiences with nature.</p>
<p><br/>In a nutshell: it was the best experience of my life and I'm so thankful so <br/>many people were interested to hear about my adventures!!<br/><br/>When I finished my research and returned home from Thailand at the end of 2011, I knew things couldn’t end there. I had to do more. More people need experiences like mine to gain perspective of themselves and find their place in the world; more <br/>opportunities needed to be available for young adults to experience other ways <br/>of life and consider the essential interrelatedness of humans and nature. And <br/>most importantly, I had to find a way to give back to the local communities and <br/>people who, though they had very little themselves to give, enriched my life and <br/>shared with me all that they had, taking care of me while I lived so very far <br/>away from home for so long.<br/><br/>And so, I initiated the Jackie Prime Project (<a href=""http://www.jackieprime.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.jackieprime.org</a>).</p>
<p><strong><strong>The Project</strong><br/></strong>The main purpose of the Jackie Prime Project is to create opportunities for young adults to experience other cultures and live in nature, developing their skills of compassion, self-value/confidence and empathy, and to educate people about the interconnectedness of humans and nature. <br/><br/>With the help of a few of my friends and dedicated student volunteers, I have created an enthusiastic group of peers to help me build my vision and share it with others. We believe that knowledge of the connections between humans and nature through active participation in the world fosters harmony, empathy for others, and globally responsible individuals.</p>
<p>We're still a small group, but with your support we can create opportunities for other <br/>students to venture outside the classroom and experience the world first hand in <br/>a fun, safe, and educational way.</p>
<p><strong>The purpose of this fundraising campaign</strong> is to help us raise funds to initiate our prospective core programs:</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Core Programs:</span></p>

<li>promote activities that teach global responsibility through experiential education trips abroad </li>
<li>provide educational materials, resources and supplies to underprivileged youth living in rural Thailand in the Nakon Ratchasima Province of North-Eastern Thailand where Khao Yai is located</li>
<li>produce educational videos that highlight ongoing JPP activities and humanitarian work, showcase current academic fieldwork by graduate students and professors around the globe, and detail conservation and environmental topics to keep viewers informed</li>

Our Story
We are four friends from Germany and Indonesia and founders of the environmental initiative Making Oceans Plastic Free. We are passionate about the conservation of our oceans and it is our aim to preserve this gift to pass on to the next generations.
The Team

We developed Tasini inspired by our different backgrounds. Roger studying ways to reduce plastic bag use in a PhD research project; Pari holding a degree in Biology and researching Indonesian society as a cultural anthropologist; Adith consulting government and businesses on cleaner production; and Lia designing fun and creative products.
Indonesia - the world’s second largest source of marine plastic pollution
With a focus on Indonesia - the world’s second largest source of marine plastic pollution - we can make a real difference. But we believe that changing behavior around the world works best when it’s easy and fun. This has been our inspiration to create Tasini.
Tasini Features - ""Special Agents""



Our Aim
With our own funds we have produced the first 1000 Tasini. Now we need your support to achieve our 3 main goals:
1. Launch a big environmental awareness campaign in Indonesia:
The likeable Tasini marine animals are the right environmental ambassadors to raise awareness about plastic bag pollution. With your funding we can create a big media campaign raising environmental awareness in Indonesia.
2. Produce Tasini Bags from recycled plastic waste (PET):
Fabrics from recycled PET are not yet common in Indonesia. To produce the fabrics, large quantities need to be ordered. With your funding we will be able to fill the minimum order quantity and start using recycled plastic waste for our Tasini bags.
3. Making Tasini affordable to everyone:
The more people we reach, the greater our impact to reduce plastic bag use. This is why we want to keep the price for Tasini as low as possible. With your funding, we can reduce costs for production while securing ethical and sustainable standards.

As a thank you for your contribution we have created some great perks for you. Take a look!

<p></p><p></p>
<p>Since
most of the 1.32 billion pounds of shrimp imported into the United States per
year are unsustainably harvested, it is reported by Oceana and others
that for every 1 pound of tropical shrimp caught through trawling the bottom
of the ocean, 10 pounds of other marine life is killed. This fishing
technique “clear cuts” the ocean floor, catching shrimp and everything in its
path with much of the ""bycatch"" which could be a source of food for
humans  being redirected to waste, so this key protein source is taken away
from people who need it the most. The total area of seabed trawled each year is
nearly 150 times the area of the world's forests that are clear cut. <br/></p><p>Only 10% of the wild
caught shrimp consumed in the United States each year comes from the Gulf of
Mexico and the South Atlantic Oceans. The rest – some 1.2 billion pounds – is
pond raised or wild caught in China, Thailand, Indonesia and
Vietnam.</p><p>The<i> Guardian</i> newspaper in a June 10, 2014 investigative report states that up to 300,000 people are chattel slaves in Thailand working to produce the fish meal that is used for shrimp feed. Check the shrimp that you eat. Look on the back of the bag that says ""sustainably grown"" and see where that shrimp comes from. Please view the investigative report video.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fh6ieOeOxaVE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dh6ieOeOxaVE&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fh6ieOeOxaVE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div>Traditional
shrimp farming involves the use of wild shrimp stocked in large, coastal ponds
where high water-exchange rates are used to maintain acceptable pond water
quality. There are a number of concerns associated with this approach,
including coastal water pollution from pond effluent, crop loss from disease
due to frequent exposure to shrimp pathogens, and destruction of valuable
mangrove habitat for farm construction. In addition, in many places around the
world, traditional shrimp farms cannot provide year-round production due to a
limited growing season.<p></p><p>This picture is of a traditional shrimp farm of almost 2500 acres. It is located on the coast next to mangrove forests, produces 5 million pounds
 of shrimp per year and has a huge environmental footprint.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/679381/files/20140627105728-Traditiona__Shrimp_Farming.jpg?1403891848"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>The Project</b><br/><br/>The shrimp farm to be constructed is a Solar Biosecure Super Intensive
Shrimp Farm utilizing the latest innovations in solar power, aquaculture and
technology. This state-of-the-art facility to be located in the Dominican
Republic, built with American technology and hardware will grow a Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) Pacific White Shrimp (<i>Penaeus
Vannamei</i>). This high-density, indoor biosecure facility will have the
capacity to produce approximately 5 million pounds of Jumbo to Extra Jumbo
weight shrimp per year exported to the United States. <p></p>
<p>This
system allows for stocking densities that are many times higher than
traditional shrimp farming and allows for land and water use that is a fraction
of what is used in traditional shrimp farming. The farm will provide a
reliable and environmentally sustainable production technology package which will

<p></p>
<p>Biofloc
technology (BFT) is a relatively new biotechnology which means to control water
quality in shrimp and fish aquaculture to minimize water exchange and
environmental pollution, to recycle feed and reduce production cost. This
system can be used to develop a sustainable and environmentally friendly
aquaculture.</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FZ56V4O2_4Ks%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZ56V4O2_4Ks&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZ56V4O2_4Ks%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div>
<p>The
biofloc system allows production of shrimp without exchange of water. Its
phase production maximizes the utilization of water volume by using a two- phase
split growing system and partial harvesting. It allows harvesting of daily
fresh shrimp through partial harvesting without stressing the remaining shrimp
in the tank.</p>
<p>The interaction with the bioreactors reduces the excess sludge production and nitrate buildup. Excess bioflocs
can be removed without special equipment. Intensive aeration allows high
biomass densities and keeps the flocs in suspension. Utilization of substrates
increases the surface of shrimp tanks and provides extra hiding and resting
places for molting shrimp as well as an increased area for nitrification and
production of micro-organisms. </p>
<p>Thanks
to zero exchange of water with no effluents, the environmental impact is
reduced. The application of such a system meets the growing aquaculture concept
of a responsible, sustainable and environmentally friendly shrimp farming
method.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
system also reduces the risk of introduction and spread of diseases. When
covered with a building, this system provides the only good option
for a biosecure shrimp farm. Because the module is equipped with an advanced
bioreactor, this increases the flexibility of water quality management. The addition
of chemicals for pH adjustment is not necessary and nitrate levels are
controlled. </p>
<p>Excess
bioflocs can be removed without special equipment. The advanced utilization and
control of bioflocs not only reduces the environmental impact but also enables
nutrient recycling into new protein biomass as additional nutrition for the
shrimp, resulting in faster growth and reducing the amount of feed needed to grow a pound of shrimp. Thanks to the re-use of
water, the system can be built anywhere in the world, in the tropics, in
temperate climates, in the desert, close to towns, and in buildings. The system is easy to handle and manage and has low
operational costs.
</p><p>This
bioreactor is customized to the farm production strategy. Its design
incorporates bioreactors, pond aeration systems, tanks for production and waste
water treatment. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Cutting
Edge Water Recycling System</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The water recycling system is one of the newest unique technologies which is being
employed in this project; its water recycling process enhances biosecurity.
Since the iso-osmotic concentration for <span>the
shrimp is in the 20- to 25- ppt range, medium-salinity seawater is
physiologically advantageous for shrimp growth, while still providing adequate
levels to offset possible nitrite toxicities.</span></p>
<p>Water
recycling from run to run also facilitates faster turn-around between harvest
and restocking, eliminating the need to condition new water before each
restocking. Juvenile shrimp are acclimated to the growout race-way water by
slowly running existing raceway water through the adjacent nursery tank starting
about two weeks prior to stocking.</p><p></p><b>Conclusion</b>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>The
farm will be solar powered, environmentally protected, biosecure, have minimal water exchange,
a minimal footprint per ton of production, fast growth, and ever more efficient
food conversion ratios utilizing the latest biofloc technology. This
facility will be a model for shrimp farmers to follow. It will be the first solar shrimp farm in the world
utilizing and developing breakthrough technologies in the aquaculture industry;
and be a transparent showcase of the latest innovations in shrimp farming, while being
certified by the leading international bodies responsible for global and aquaculture
standards and practices. <br/></p><p>Even with strong interest to purchase the shrimp from major supermarkets 
and restaurants nothing is better than their customers and our supporters asking for 
the product by name. We need our supporters asking their local retailers 
for the product. It would be great if BluAqua could partner with retailers. Some great chefs have asked for the shrimp even wanting us to raise shrimp to just 8 shrimp per pound for their restaurants. Follow us on

Since
most of the 1.32 billion pounds of shrimp imported into the United States per
year are unsustainably harvested, it is reported by Oceana and others
that for every 1 pound of tropical shrimp caught through trawling the bottom
of the ocean, 10 pounds of other marine life is killed. This fishing
technique “clear cuts” the ocean floor, catching shrimp and everything in its
path with much of the ""bycatch"" which could be a source of food for
humans  being redirected to waste, so this key protein source is taken away
from people who need it the most. The total area of seabed trawled each year is
nearly 150 times the area of the world's forests that are clear cut. Only 10% of the wild
caught shrimp consumed in the United States each year comes from the Gulf of
Mexico and the South Atlantic Oceans. The rest – some 1.2 billion pounds – is
pond raised or wild caught in China, Thailand, Indonesia and
Vietnam.The Guardian newspaper in a June 10, 2014 investigative report states that up to 300,000 people are chattel slaves in Thailand working to produce the fish meal that is used for shrimp feed. Check the shrimp that you eat. Look on the back of the bag that says ""sustainably grown"" and see where that shrimp comes from. Please view the investigative report video.Traditional
shrimp farming involves the use of wild shrimp stocked in large, coastal ponds
where high water-exchange rates are used to maintain acceptable pond water
quality. There are a number of concerns associated with this approach,
including coastal water pollution from pond effluent, crop loss from disease
due to frequent exposure to shrimp pathogens, and destruction of valuable
mangrove habitat for farm construction. In addition, in many places around the
world, traditional shrimp farms cannot provide year-round production due to a
limited growing season.This picture is of a traditional shrimp farm of almost 2500 acres. It is located on the coast next to mangrove forests, produces 5 million pounds
 of shrimp per year and has a huge environmental footprint.The ProjectThe shrimp farm to be constructed is a Solar Biosecure Super Intensive
Shrimp Farm utilizing the latest innovations in solar power, aquaculture and
technology. This state-of-the-art facility to be located in the Dominican
Republic, built with American technology and hardware will grow a Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) Pacific White Shrimp (Penaeus
Vannamei). This high-density, indoor biosecure facility will have the
capacity to produce approximately 5 million pounds of Jumbo to Extra Jumbo
weight shrimp per year exported to the United States. 
This
system allows for stocking densities that are many times higher than
traditional shrimp farming and allows for land and water use that is a fraction
of what is used in traditional shrimp farming. The farm will provide a
reliable and environmentally sustainable production technology package which will
allow for the production of healthy, good-tasting seafood at competitive
prices that will be both Organic Certified and certified by the Aquatic
Stewardship Council.Below is an architect's rendering of our Solar Biosecure Shrimp Farm on just 16 acres, taking water from the sea through just a 3 inch pipe, which will produce 5 million pounds of shrimp per year with almost zero environmental footprint. Design by Aquaculture Farming TechnologyOur shrimp farm will save a mangrove forest like the one in this picture.Countries are going to enter the aquaculture business or look to grow their existing market share; this project has the Dominican Republic doing it in an environmentally friendly way.The
Government of the Dominican Republic has contributed to the farm 16 acres of land including the environmental permits and full support of the government for the project
including job training, infrastructure and Free Zone status. The granting of Free Zone status means no corporate income taxes for 25 years, zero VAT and no import or export duties. This will allow us to put those savings back into the project to build more modules and even additional farms saving more coastal ecosystems.About
80% of the seafood consumed in the United States comes from somewhere else and
only 2% of that is inspected and 1% is tested in a lab. The FDA continues to
report in an alert issued in April 2014 “the use of unapproved antibiotics or

coastal waters, has caused die-offs of cultivated shrimp in several Asian
countries.

For
shrimp to survive and grow well, pond water temperatures need to be maintained
within a narrow range, and large outdoor ponds cannot
accommodate this requirement. In light of the disadvantages and constraints of
traditional shrimp farming, alternative approaches need to be implemented in

shrimp is in the 20- to 25- ppt range, medium-salinity seawater is
physiologically advantageous for shrimp growth, while still providing adequate
levels to offset possible nitrite toxicities.
Water
recycling from run to run also facilitates faster turn-around between harvest
and restocking, eliminating the need to condition new water before each
restocking. Juvenile shrimp are acclimated to the growout race-way water by
slowly running existing raceway water through the adjacent nursery tank starting
about two weeks prior to stocking.Conclusion

The
farm will be solar powered, environmentally protected, biosecure, have minimal water exchange,
a minimal footprint per ton of production, fast growth, and ever more efficient
food conversion ratios utilizing the latest biofloc technology. This
facility will be a model for shrimp farmers to follow. It will be the first solar shrimp farm in the world
utilizing and developing breakthrough technologies in the aquaculture industry;
and be a transparent showcase of the latest innovations in shrimp farming, while being
certified by the leading international bodies responsible for global and aquaculture
standards and practices. Even with strong interest to purchase the shrimp from major supermarkets 
and restaurants nothing is better than their customers and our supporters asking for 
the product by name. We need our supporters asking their local retailers 
for the product. It would be great if BluAqua could partner with retailers. Some great chefs have asked for the shrimp even wanting us to raise shrimp to just 8 shrimp per pound for their restaurants. Follow us on 
Twitter, like us on Facebook and we will update you on the project's progress, product availability, fantastic seafood recipes (on our Twitter page now Bucatini with Pesto and Shrimp) and send you coupons.Our PerksWe have thoughtfully chosen perks to thank you for supporting the effort to make the shrimp farm a reality such as our special logo T-shirt just for our crowdfunding supporters and art pieces made by the Taino Indians. The Taino greeted Columbus when he landed in the Americas. We applaud you and thank all of you for not just supporting this project but also for supporting the Taino.                                                BluAqua Farm Logo T-Shirt                    100% Cotton T-Shirt  Made in the USA by American Apparel                                                                 Mama Juana Herbs and BottleMama Juana is concocted by allowing rum, red wine, and honey to soak in a bottle with tree bark and wild herbs. The taste is similar to port wine and the color is deep red.The specific herbs that make up Mama Juana were originally prepared as a herbal tea by the native Taino Indians; post-Columbus alcohol was added to the recipe. We have never seen Mama Juana available in the USA. Our favorite concoction is to use dark rum (Dominican or Puerto Rican) or cachaca, a Rioja (your choice) and Black Mangrove honey.Our special T shirt logo is on the back of the 750 ml bottle with a thank-you note. Recipe included, just refill when empty, it is good for several refills.Taino AmuletsThe Taino Amulets are replicas of Taino Pre-Colombian artifacts that are hand made of red clay, carved with sticks and fired in sand kilns the same way the Taino's ancestors made them.                                                       Taino Batea Taino hand carved wood bowls (Batea in Spanish) that are hand painted with different scenes and signed by the artists. The Bowls are 12-14 inches long, 7-9 inches wide and 2 inches deep.                             Hand Painted Tin Mugs By Taino ArtistsOn our Facebook page is a recipe for Watermelon Gazpacho. Served in these mugs, it's a beautiful way to kick off a dinner party.",16.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Melanie Wheeler.  I'm a sophomore studying music education at the tiny school of Earlham College in the only slightly larger town of Richmond, Indiana.  The reason you're here reading this campaign is because from October to December of this year, I will be interning in southeast Madagascar with Azafady, a registered UK charity whose mission is to alleviate poverty and conserve the endangered forest environments in southeast Madagascar.  As part of the pre-travel preparations, I've begun campaigning to fundraise for this awesome organization</p>
<p>Madagascar is simultaneously one of the most ecologically diverse and poverty stricken countries in the world.  The country hosts a diverse range of flora and fauna, 80% of which are found exclusively on the island.  Yet, due to growing industrialization and demand, the country has experienced 90% deforestation.  The environmental crisis is compounded with the fact that 77% of the population live under the international poverty line ($1.25 USD/day) and more than 65% of the population are living without access to clean water.</p>
<p>To keep it brief, Azafday is paired with a Malagasy NGO (ONG Azafady) that builds its projects sensitively around the directly expressed needs of the rural communities outside of Ft. Dauphin (a coastal city near the bottom of Madagascar).  Within the mission of alleviating poverty and conserving environment, Azafady works to meet those needs in a sustainable fashion.  The specific program I'm involved with, the Pioneer Program, works in three interrelated areas:</p>
<p>-Sustainable livelihood development</p>
<p>-health based infrastructure and education</p>
<p>-habitat conservation</p>
<p>Therefore the work that I will be doing could range from reforestation to helping communities start small, income generating business to building, wells, latrines, and schools.</p>
<p>But <em>why?</em>  Why would some random college student want to travel halfway across the world to work in a tiny country?  And more importantly, <strong>why should you care?</strong></p>
<p>Well, on a personal level, I'm at point in my education where I'm ready to grow in ways that a classroom can't offer me.  <strong>I'm ready for the world to be my classroom and for experience to be my teacher</strong> (don't worry, I'll be returning to college in the spring).  On what I guess you could call a more altruistic level, <strong>I believe we all have a calling to ease to suffering in the world.  I suppose you could say this is mine.</strong></p>
<p>I can't promise much.  There's no flashy end product, no tangible way of knowing you've done good.  All I can promise is that the money you help me fundraise will go to a purpose that I am a 110% invested in.  I can promise a peace of mind that your money will not just go to cause, but it will go to people and to valuable experience.  Your donations will go directly to Azafady , of which 90% of it will go directly to funding on-the-ground projects.</p>
<p>There's also some pretty cool incentives to donate :)</p>
<p>You can't donate?  No problem!  Help me spread the word!  Post this page on your facebook wall, your twitter account, or whatever social media you're involved with.  Talk to your friends about.  I can't do this fundraising on my own; I need your help  The beauty of this campaign is that it's not just about it money, it's also about raising awareness.  </p>

L’influence des Entreprises sur nos habitudes de consommation, et par conséquent sur notre planète, est colossale. Elles doivent donc devenir LES LEADERS en terme de développement durable et responsable, ainsi qu’être à la hauteur de la confiance que nous leur vouons en achetant leurs biens.


Les Conseils Municipaux représentent sans doute le seul palier de gouvernement à toujours pouvoir interagir à un niveau humain; ils sont néanmoins assez puissants pour que leurs actions aient de réels impacts au niveau global. C’est sur eux qu’il faut pouvoir compter pour initier, supporter et sommer les actions de changement.

Suite au lancement, nous mettrons en branle notre stratégie de ""sponsorship"" pour assurer la suite de nos opérations. Nous tenons par ailleurs à préciser que nous ne ferons jamais appel à la publicité pour recueillir des fonds.
 
LES ""GOODIES"" !

La plus grande contrepartie dont vous pouvez vous prévaloir est la satisfaction personnelle de participer à cet effort, qui veut donner un nouvel élan au Mouvement Vert.
Ceci dit, nous voulons bien sûr souligner votre participation avec quelques « Goodies » ! 


Les mini-badges - Nous avons fait graver sur le rebord de nos premiers 1000 badges l'inscription suivante "" I'M ONE OF THE FIRST 1000 GREENPLEASERS"". Il nous en reste environ 400. Le prochain lot sera identifié par ""I'M GREENPLEASER #1000-2000"", et ainsi de suite. Ne tardez pas !




Votre Greenplease T-Shirt - Les T-Shirts que nous nous procurons proviennent de fournisseurs utilisant des matières biologiques et recyclées. Si la présente campagne réussi à générer une commande importante de T-Shirts nous pourrons opter pour du chanvre biologique ! Commandez donc en grand nombre !



L'entête de votre TURF à votre image - Projetez-vous 3 ans dans le futur et imaginez que Greenplease soit ""LA"" plateforme verte par excellence que tout le monde utilise. Ne souhaiteriez-vous pas faire partie de la poignée de Visionnaires dont l'entête de TURF arbore un vert distinctif ?

 
L'Équipe de Greenplease
Xavier Bonacorsi   (Fondateur - basé au Canada)

Des années de voyages, d’études hétéroclites (sur & hors campus), ainsi qu’au front d’une multitude de projets, m’ont fait développer un très grand respect pour la vie, sous toutes ses formes. Greenplease est issu de ce mode vie, et est alimenté par le désir de briser ce sentiment d’impuissance qui nous tient en échec quant aux enjeux importants.
 
Friedhelm Filler   (Co-fondateur - basé en Allemagne)

Une facilité pour les maths et plusieurs startups internationales m’ont permis de voyager à travers le monde dès mon jeune âge. Ces expériences m’ont fait voir que nous nous servions de la Terre comme s’il n’y avait pas de lendemain. De réaliser à quel point nous exagérons les excès me pousse aujourd'hui à diriger mes efforts afin que la trace de mon passage sur Terre soit... « Verte » !
 
Peter Myers   (Co-fondateur - basé en Nouvelle-Zélande)

Après avoir exploré la majorité des systèmes sociétaux qui se sont développés au cours du dernier siècle, je réalise que de continuer sur ces chemins ne peut que nous conduire vers des conséquences irréparables. Depuis dix ans, je m’applique donc à développer localement des initiatives vertes. Ma règle d’or est de vivre selon, et utiliser des « systèmes » durables et responsables.
 
Hélène Breton   (Co-fondatrice - basée au Canada)

Gestionnaire de ressources humaines; voyageuse fascinée par la nature humaine et ses différentes cultures; mère de deux adolescents de plus en plus préoccupés par leur avenir. C’est à travers cette réalité que s’inspire ma détermination pour Greenplease. Nous arrivons à une croisée des chemins cruciale pour notre futur, mais surtout pour celui de nos enfants. Il est maintenant impératif de se rappeller que tout ce que nous faisons aujourd’hui affectera LEUR demain…
 
Une plateforme intransigeante, mais constructive et respectueuse
Greenplease est une plateforme gérée par ses communautés. Ses administrateurs n’émettront jamais d’opinions ou de commentaires personnels; et, si Greenplease est un lieu pour les critiques, les réprimandes et les désaccords, une attitude constructive et respectueuse est néanmoins de rigueur.

 
Participez à l'effet d'entraînement : Passez le mot !
Afin qu'un mouvement lève et prenne de l'envergure, il doit être diffusé largement: passez le mot ! Parlez-en à vos amis, sur Twitter, Facebook, sur vos blogs, etc.
Vous avez des idées et désirez contribuer davantage à l'essor de Greenplease, n'hésitez pas à communiquer avec nous à info(a)greenplease.fr

<h1>Maasai Weaving Project</h1>
<p><em>What is the Maasai Weaving Project?</em></p>
<p>This project aims to use the strength of the Maasai community's creative energy to spark a change in the way that discarded materials are used. By providing looms, weaving supplies, and upcycling know-how to local artisans, we aim to draw attention to the problem of overabundant plastic waste. Cows and wildlife are dying as they ingest the plastic bags that litter Kenya's Maasai Mara Reserve. This brings great hardship to the livestock-dependent Maasai. This project will focus on teaching Maasai women how to turn plastic waste into woven mats, bags, and other marketable products. We hope to transform communities by empowering women with new skills. The products created through the weaving of plastic bags will provide a source of income for families, reduce the amount of plastic ingested by Maasai cattle and wildlife, and give visitors and tourists a tangible way to share the story of the Maasai with their friends and family back home. </p>
<p><em>Who is involved?</em></p>
<p>This idea originated with James Nampushi, a Maasai leader now working towards his doctorate in Parks and Wildlife Management at Clemson University. As a member of the Maasai community, he saw firsthand the effects of plastic waste on the Masaai way of life, and sought a solution. He contacted Chris Gustin of <a href=""http://www.homesteadweaver.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Homestead Weaving</a> in Indiana. Gustin has been making beautiful scarves and rugs out of recycled materials for over 20 years. She generously gave her time and knowledge to teach James and me how to turn plastic bags into colorful, washable rugs. My name is Linda Whelihan and I am an artist and teacher in Brattleboro, Vermont, particularly interested in working with recycled materials. For the past 10 years, I have been collaborating with William Sirkobei ole Osono, James' cousin and a Maasai safari guide, in efforts to share Maasai culture with communities and school groups along the east coast. </p>
<p><em>What is the timeframe of this project?</em></p>
<p>Our fundraising campaign will begin in early April, and end after Earth Day on April, 30th. We will be traveling to Kenya in July and spending two weeks with the women in a community center on the Maasai Mara Reserve. We will focus on providing the women with enough hands-on experience and information to continue growing the project and educating others after we are gone. </p>
<p><em>What will the funds be used for specifically? </em></p>
<p>The money raised through this campaign will be used to fund the purchase of a loom, knitting supplies and my transportation to Kenya. Any extra funding will go towards additional looms and a pedal powered sewing machine.</p>

<p><strong>More than a year after the triple meltdown at Fukushima, Japan and the rest of the world continue to grapple with the short- and long-term consequences. The myth that nuclear power can deliver us from the long-term hazards of fossil fuels has been shattered. Renewable energy, long dismissed as impractical, is being given serious reconsideration. Japan can and must take advantage of this opportunity to rethink and refocus its energy strategies. </strong></p>
<p> <strong><img alt=""nuke"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kyotojournal.org/images/BrokenNuke2-flat.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/> </strong></p>
<p>In Kyoto, birthplace of the Kyoto Protocol, a dedicated group of reporters, writers, artists, editors, and photographers associated with <em>Kyoto Journal</em> (<a href=""http://www.kyotojournal.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kyotojournal.org</a>) is taking a fresh look at proven and innovative alternative technologies such as solar, wind, geothermal, mini-hydro, and biomass as well as the even greater number that are being actively researched, but are insufficiently recognized and under-funded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>With your help, our goal is to produce an investigative publication,<em>“Fresh Currents: Japan’s Flow from a Nuclear Past to a Renewable Future,” </em>first in English, with the possibility of having it subsequently published in Japanese, which we will do our best to get into the hands of key policymakers, local government officials, community leaders, educators, and media outlets.

<p>Why is this so important? Japan’s entrenched pro-nuclear lobby is desperate to reinstitute “business as usual,” as it has after far too many previous accidents. The nuclear industry’s dismal safety record, reflecting both amazing arrogance and catastrophic negligence, shows that safer, sustainable alternatives <em>must</em> be found and developed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a critical moment, with a strong citizens’ movement underway demanding a national referendum on nuclear power. Even Japan’s current Minister for the Economy, Trade and Industry admits that it’s time to phase out nuclear generation of electricity. Our “Fresh Currents” project has vital potential to identify viable renewable energy mix options. We believe that it can make a significant contribution to the debate on the future of energy production – not only in Japan, but worldwide.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a small Colombian university (UPTC) in the provincial capital of Tunja.  For a year and a half now we have been researching ten Andean crops that were used by the ancient Muisca people of our region, and continue to be grown and consumed by the traditional peasantry. </p>
<p>An important component of our project is an agronomic experiment on one of these crops, achira (Canna indica), carried out together with local farmers from the towns of Somondoco and Guayatá.  This plant is mainly used in Colombia for the starch that can be extracted from its root-like rhizomes and used in various traditional baked goods, though the root can also be cooked and eaten whole, like a potato.  Aside from its links to local traditional culture, achira is attractive because it is an undemanding crop, requiring few chemical inputs and very compatible with the small-scale mixed cropping system practiced by most peasants in our region of Boyacá.</p>
<p>Our work is important because we are doing grassroots, applied research on achira, asking the sort of basic agronomic questions that have already been largely answered for major crops like corn or wheat, but which are virtual unknowns for a minor, local crop like achira.  In particular, we are evaluating four varieties of achira to learn about yield and nutritional quality of fresh rhizomes (for eating cooked), of extracted starch (for baked goods), and of the leaves, which can be used for animal feed. </p>
<p>By contributing to our project you will allow us to obtain valuable data that will comprise a reference point for farmers and researchers interested in expanding cultivation of this unique, ecologically responsible, and peasant-friendly crop.  A future of sustainable food and agriculture for all of us depends precisely on small-scale, applied research of the type we are performing, carried out by farmers and academics in different local contexts around the world.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Harvest time is approaching, and we are making all the logistical arrangements after a year of caring for our crop and taking scientific measurements.  But due to rising prices and some miscalculations in our initial budget, we are short $1500US.  This is the amount necessary for us to send 50 samples of rhizomes and extracted starch to a laboratory for a chemical analysis that will tell us what nutritional benefits achira in general has to offer small farmers and food processors, as well as the relative strengths of each variety of achira.</p>
<p>We are offering some perks for big donors: all donors of $20US or more will receive a shout-out on our lead researcher's blog, agrarianideas.blogspot.com.  Donors at the $50 level will get the shout-out and a pdf copy of the first article we successfully get published in a respected academic journal as a result of our research.  For those who give $100US or more to the achira cause, we will thank you in the acknowledgments section of this article.  And for any special achira godmothers (or godfathers) who give $500US, our lead researcher will offer his services as a personal tour guide if you come to visit Colombia.</p>
<p>All money we receive up to our goal amount will go to fund these laboratory analyses.  If we don't receive the full amount, our team of researchers will have to pitch in out of pocket to cover the difference, which represents more than a month's wages for our lead researcher, and even more for our other team members.  If we are lucky enough to exceed the $1500US we need, any surplus will go to form a fund with local farmers to finance future achira-related projects (a semi-mechanized processing plant, for instance).</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As noted above, your donation will fund research that is increasingly necessary in an uncertain food future.  Such grassroots, farmer-level research is too rarely financed by big public organizations, and almost never by large agricultural companies (who don't stand to earn anything from small farmers growing an undemanding crop using few purchased inputs).  Achira is versatile not only ecologically, but because it can serve the farmer as a home-grown food, a small-scale industrial/commercial product, or an animal feed.  As for many locally-adapted crops, achira cultivation is increasingly being abandoned as farmers plant other species that receive more research attention and marketing support, or as young people leave the countryside for jobs in the city.  Our research is laying the knowledge groundwork (and creating an excitement and social validation around the crop) that will encourage farmers to plant more achira.  This will lower pesticide use as compared to most other crops, as well as offering a new, viable economic option to attract and keep young farmers in the area.</p>
<p> </p>

<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, or if you're able to donate less than you would have liked to, we would appreciate it if you share our project with your friends and family, via facebook, indiegogo, or good old-fashioned word of mouth or email.  </p>

</p><p>Coral reefs are living, dynamic ecosystems that provide invaluable services: they acts as nursery grounds for 25 to 30% of all marine fishes and invertebrates, provide natural storm barriers for coastlines, purify carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, are potential sources for pharmaceuticals, and are also the ocean garden. Already 20% of the coral reef has disappeared as the result of pollution from industrial waste, sewage, chemicals, oil spills, fertilizers, runoff from land and sedimentation produced by climate change, acidification, destructive fishing practices and, in the Atlantic, the invasion of the lion fish (pterois). Researchers believe that coral reefs and the marine creatures that rely on them may die off within the next 50 to 100 years, causing the global extinction of a worldwide ecosystem. Coral Peace organization has been founded to face this challenge by applying innovative techniques to maximize coral growth using middle underwater sub-aquatic nursery. Within a year we can transplant more than 3000 pieces of coral on the reef.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is Coral Peace?</p>
<p>Our mission is restore piece by piece the coral reefs with the development of an ecotourism strength. </p>
<p>The objectives to meet this mission are to :</p>
<p>- Create an interest to the tourists to be a part of the construction of coral reefs by offering them the possibility of planting their piece of coral.</p>
<p>- Create a website on which they will follow the development of their reef.</p>
<p>- Create an exhibition to raise consciousness of the current state of the marine life.</p>
<p>- Raise awareness amongst local residents of our new mission to protect the new coral reefs.</p>
<p>- In the longer term, create a worldwide competition for the creation of the most beautiful coral garden pioneering</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coral Peace is a determination to rebuild and reconstruct the reef. The first project will be launched in Dominica “The Nature Island”, in the Caribbean. Dominica is the best place to start the first project; this country is not oriented toward massive tourism, with only propeller airplane landing on the island, reminding you, with the dense rainforest on your left side, the movie Jurassic Park 3. In addition to unique diving sites, the island receives trekkers for their 365 rivers, fresh water lakes, falls, National Parks and protected Forest Reserves, covering almost one-third of the island.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Coral Peace team is a coalition of determinate people dedicated to the rebuilding of the reef. Under the guidance of a project manager, commercial divers provide the expertise for the construction of the sub-aquatic nursery designed based on innovative techniques developed by world-renowned researchers, while instruction divers insure the maintenance of the installation. The promotion team focuses on developing an ecotourism force to self-finance the continuity of the project in partnerships with local communities, businesses and decision-makers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What your money will do?</p>
<p>Coral Peace works in association with dive centers of the island dedicated to the health of the ocean. Our first project in Dominica will be elaborated with The Anchorage Hotel, Whale Watch and dive center located near the capital of Roseau. Our organization installs the sub-aquatic infrastructure and the ground lab, teaches and trains local diving instructors and personnel for the protection and the techniques of cutting and transplantation. We construct and elaborate an interpretation center for tourists, primary and secondary schools of the island, we do the promotion of the dive center as an eco-responsible organization and finally for the eco-responsable gifts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Coral?</p>
<p></p><p><b>It is important to note that all the coral grown by Coral Peace will be transplanted in the ocean; no coral will be for sale.</b> </p> Coral Peace also works with collaborators and we are proud to announce that Ms. Céline Cousteau is ready to promote our project with <a href=""http://www.causecentric.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">CauseCentric</a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Productions.</span><div>
<br/><p>For the first project, we need from Indiegogo financial campaign, $250,000 for the shipment of the material and tools, the commercial divers, the training, the promotion, the elaboration and construction of the interpretation center and your reward gifts. If we achieve our goal and reach more, the amount will be allocated to start another project on another island in the Caribbean. Finally, the more we receive, the more coral will grow in the ocean. We are a small organization with no infrastructure and employees to support, 95% of the money will be applied on the coral development and on awareness raising initiatives and 5% on administrative costs..</p>

In addition to unique diving sites, the island receives trekkers for their 365 rivers, fresh water lakes, falls, National Parks and protected Forest Reserves, covering almost one-third of the island.

The Coral Peace team is a coalition of determinate people dedicated to the rebuilding of the reef. Under the guidance of a project manager, commercial divers provide the expertise for the construction of the sub-aquatic nursery designed based on innovative techniques developed by world-renowned researchers, while instruction divers insure the maintenance of the installation. The promotion team focuses on developing an ecotourism force to self-finance the continuity of the project in partnerships with local communities, businesses and decision-makers.

What your money will do?
Coral Peace works in association with dive centers of the island dedicated to the health of the ocean. Our first project in Dominica will be elaborated with The Anchorage Hotel, Whale Watch and dive center located near the capital of Roseau. Our organization installs the sub-aquatic infrastructure and the ground lab, teaches and trains local diving instructors and personnel for the protection and the techniques of cutting and transplantation. We construct and elaborate an interpretation center for tourists, primary and secondary schools of the island, we do the promotion of the dive center as an eco-responsible organization and finally for the eco-responsable gifts.

The Coral?
It is important to note that all the coral grown by Coral Peace will be transplanted in the ocean; no coral will be for sale.  Coral Peace also works with collaborators and we are proud to announce that Ms. Céline Cousteau is ready to promote our project with CauseCentric Productions.
For the first project, we need from Indiegogo financial campaign, $250,000 for the shipment of the material and tools, the commercial divers, the training, the promotion, the elaboration and construction of the interpretation center and your reward gifts. If we achieve our goal and reach more, the amount will be allocated to start another project on another island in the Caribbean. Finally, the more we receive, the more coral will grow in the ocean. We are a small organization with no infrastructure and employees to support, 95% of the money will be applied on the coral development and on awareness raising initiatives and 5% on administrative costs..


Coral Peace may seem a drop in the ocean but it is a good one. Many have talked about the importance of coral reefs, Coral Peace is ready to act.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

This year I am starting a business called Earth Magic Permaculture which will offer edible landscaping services as well as eco education. Part of doing this is creating a learning garden in my backyard. The Learning Garden will be a place where people can learn hands-on permaculture skills such as garden design, how to attract pollintaors, composting, and more! I am determined to green the suburbs in my city. <br/><br/>One aspect of The Learning Garden that I am really excited about and need support for is urban beekeeping. This spring and summer I hope to set up bee hives and begin to do urban beekeeping. A lot has to go into that: workshops, equipment, the hives, and, of course, the bees! I am trying to raise $600 to support this aspect of the Learning Garden. <br/>   <div>This was going to be part two of my campaign but because money was not raised for the course I wished to attend, it is now part one!<br/><p></p>

</div></div>","Short SummaryI am passionate about permaculture and urban gardening. This year I am starting a business called Earth Magic Permaculture which will offer edible landscaping services as well as eco education. Part of doing this is creating a learning garden in my backyard. The Learning Garden will be a place where people can learn hands-on permaculture skills such as garden design, how to attract pollintaors, composting, and more! I am determined to green the suburbs in my city. One aspect of The Learning Garden that I am really excited about and need support for is urban beekeeping. This spring and summer I hope to set up bee hives and begin to do urban beekeeping. A lot has to go into that: workshops, equipment, the hives, and, of course, the bees! I am trying to raise $600 to support this aspect of the Learning Garden.    This was going to be part two of my campaign but because money was not raised for the course I wished to attend, it is now part one!

What We Need & What You Get
The courses I wish to take will cost me $150 and the rest of the money raised will go towards equipment, hives, and BEES! I feel $600 is the minimum I need to raise to pursue this (not $1300, I am not able to change the fundraising goal).
You will get lots of great perks plus I invite everyone to come and visit my bees once I get them set up. I will happily share my knowledge with you!

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p><strong>BEE (Bicycle for Everyone's Earth)</strong> is a collective of environmental campaigners for sustainability, slow living, and environmental awareness.  Since 1997 our main activity has been the annual BEE Ride; a 2-3 month long self-supported cycle tour from the most northerly to southerly town on Japan’s four main islands. The team is made up of an international group of volunteers who teach about environmental sustainability during the ride. Over the years, BEE Japan teams have consisted of riders from all over the world committed to the concept of thinking global and acting local.  This year we have a rider hailing from USA (TX) and two lovely ladies from Kyoto and Ishikawa, Japan. You can find out more about us on our home page.  The BEE Ride uses both direct action and environmental education to demonstrate viable lifestyle alternatives.</p>

Activity Tracker - Monitor and compare your Pet's exercise levels from anywhere. 


Pet Food Dispenser - Feed your pet remotely with the right quantity of food, and connect to the webcam to check him. 

Data Cloud - Compare your Pet's exercise and weight with other pets the same age, breed and neutering state, and connect to other pet owners.
The American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) - clearly states that in order to ""keep your Pet Healthy and Happy"" you should ""Design a diet and exercise plan to meet your pet’s specific needs"".We want to make this possible and more accessible through an integrated system that balances exercise (energy expenditure) with food intake (energy consumption). We want pets to be happier and healthier, and to make that possible by providing owners with systems that enhance the understanding of their loved ones, and tools that enable them to take closer care of them, wherever you or they might be.You've just returned from a longer-than-usual walk with your dog, but aren't sure how much extra nourishment they might need … and when your cat keeps staring at the food box, is that because they're still hungry from an all-night walk, or just being greedy? With approximately 80 million US cats and dogs assessed as overweight or obese, and 12 million UK pets overfed with fatty treats, pet obesity epidemic is one of the biggest welfare issues affecting our pets today. (2012 US National Pet Obesity Survey and UK PDSA Animal Wellbeing Report 2012)Using the latest technology in accelerometers and gyroscopes, we have developed a tracking device that attaches to your pet’s collar, collecting complete data on their activity.Connected wirelessly to our Cloud Services, the Activity Tracker contrasts this data with your pet’s specific breed and age, letting you know whether your pet is getting the right amount of exercise for their target range whilst providing you with feeding advice.Secure, comfortable and adaptable to any dog or cat collar – our device’s small internal battery lasts for 6 months, so you don't have to worry about frequent recharging.
Spontaneous after-work drinks, travel delays, a meeting that’s overrunning, a last-minute confirmation about that date you were hoping would happen… Modern life means it’s not always easy to be where you initially planned. Keeping your pet's weight and health in check means a balanced diet: The right amount of food at regular times, with the right amount of exercise.Running on pre-programmed information about your pet’s specific nutritional programme, the Food Dispenser will ensure that your pet always gets the right amount of food, at the right time, and as often as it needs - throughout the day.At the tap of a finger you can command the system to dispense food to your pet.

<p>Hi, I'm Tom from La Tortuga Verde, a Turtle conservation centre and resort on El Cuco Beach, El Salvador.</p>

Hi, I'm Tom from La Tortuga Verde, a Turtle conservation centre and resort on El Cuco Beach, El Salvador.
When I came here in 2005 I was shocked and appalled that nothing was being done to stop the stealing and eating of turtle eggs. Right then and there I decided something had to be done, so I built La Tortuga Verde. 
Our mission is to give every single turtle a chance at life.
We've made huge progress with the poachers but now we need your help.
We want to buy all of the turtle eggs for the whole year and get them out of the soups in the local restaurants and back into the sea where they belong!    

We need to raise $12,500 to buy all the 50,000 Eggs laid on El Cuco beach this year. 
For as little as $5 you will save 20 baby turtles.
Using our custom built turtle sanctuary we make sure they get the best start.
Check out our incredible perks and get so much back from your donation. Make a real visible difference the these amazing creatures lives. 
  

Using the La Tortuga resort we've been making incredible progress with the locals and the poachers, but we need to stop this awful trade completely, using your donation, we'll be able to make a dramatic change to the turtle population, the eco-system and the people who live here. 
Last year La Tortuga Verde bought 25,000 eggs. We have a dedicated team of full time conservationists and volunteers who work around the clock to save these precious animals. We're now working with injured Pelicans and making progress to stop the Illegal culling of iguanas. 
All the money made at the La Tortuga resort goes back into helping the local eco-system and helping the locals create a sustainable financial base.
Last year we spent our money on the rescue and release of over 25,000 turtles and 5 Pelicans, but we can always do more, your money will help us spend more money and time on training, education and facilities to care for these endangered creatures.

While protecting coastlines is the best way to stop the trade, with less than 3% of coastlines and 1% of land protected, in El Salvador this just wont work. If we don't buy these eggs, THEY WILL ALL BE SOLD.


At La Tortuga we understand that life is hard for El Salvadorians, that's why we employ 50 locals and pay them a fair wage. We also use the resort as an opportunity to train our employees to care for the welfare of all animals.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Gifford Pinchot Task Force  (GPTF) is a registered 501(c)(3) based out of Portland, OR and Vancouver, WA that passionately supports the biological diversity and communities of the Northwest through conservation and restoration of forests, rivers, fish, and wildlife.</p>
<p>The GPTF maintains a number of key values in our stewardship of the 1.32 million acres of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Thriving biological diversity supports the high quality of life in the Northwest and is embodied by healthy runs of fish, diverse functioning forest ecosystems, clean drinking water, and inspirational recreational experiences to all those that visit the forest.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Northwest is one of the best places to demonstrate that conservation and restoration can support thriving local communities. The habitats, biodiversity and groups of regional business and contractors with forestry and watershed expertise present a wide array of collaborative opportunities to preserve a healthy, diverse, and working forest.  </span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Open and sincere collaboration with local community members, government, policy officials, and other organizations is absolutely our preferred approach to addressing issues of conservation.<br/></span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We have a committed responsibility to efficiently and carefully utilize the valuable financial resources entrusted to us. <br/></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Mount St. Helens is one of the most iconic mountains and active volcanos across the globe. Established as a National Volcanic Monument for research, recreation and education on August 27th, 1982 by President Ronald Reagan, Mt. St. Helens' continued volcanic activity positions it as one of the world's premier working laboratories for geological, environmental, and biological research. Coupled with the millions of acres of surrounding public lands and rivers, Mt. St. Helens is a treasured scenic, recreation, and cultural resource that belongs to all of us. </p>
<p>The mountain, however, has been threatened by international mining interests. In early 2010 a Canadian corporation, Ascot Resources, purchased mineral rights and is now seeking to conduct exploratory drilling just outside of the National Monument and 12 miles from the crater. The United States Forest Service approved a drilling plan in 2010 without undergoing an environmental assessment (EA) of the project and in response the Task Force filed a complaint in federal court in 2011 asking for a full environmental review of the exploratory drilling project.  U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell supported our efforts with a letter to the forest service and United States Bureau of Land Management.  </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our ongoing efforts to prevent hard rock drilling on Mt. St. Helens continues as Ascot Resources continually eyes the site as mineral prices continue to change.  If Ascot were to drill and find viable resource deposits on Mt. St. Helens, the land would be sold off to a much larger corporate open-pit mining operation.   </span></p>

<p>Here's a little more information on specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GPTF is hoping to raise $60,000 to fund full time staff and programmatic work to proactively track, research, and be involved in all aspects in opposition of the proposed drilling.  These funds will allow the GPTF to continue ongoing legal research on land management, resource, and mineral law, in addition to providing us the resources to act as advocates of the communities and regional lands in court.  As the drilling issue continues indefinitely, we are seeking funding so that we may be as prepared as possible to prevent any widespread mineral extraction near Mt. St. Helens and in our national forest. </li>
<li>As a group of passionate, committed and conservation-minded citizens, we actively provide conservation and restoration programs throughout the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.  Our ability to prevent hard rock mining on Mt. St. Helens will ensure that this beautiful and fragile ecosystem will remain intact so that it may thrive and be enjoyed by all those who visit, hike, study, and recreate on our public lands</li>
<li>If our aggregate funding goal is not met, the donated funds will go directly to ongoing conservation work on Mt.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>How your generous contributions will help:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Mining and drilling within a national forest and in such close proximity to a National Monument poses environmental, economic, and social detriment to local communities, and runs contrary to the intended use of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.</li>
<li>Mining and exploratory drilling (the utilization of hydraulic fracking fluid, blasting, high-temperature refining)  pose an unacceptable risk to streams and drinking water, impacting public health, agriculture, and fisheries.</li>
<li>Ascot Resources, a foreign corporation, stands to reap all the profits, leaving people, animals, and ecosystems downstream with a legacy of pollution.</li>
<li>Mining and drilling in this iconic and fragile area would threaten the clean water, abundant wildlife and unspoiled beauty the region is known for, compromising local quality of life and our economy.</li>

Thriving biological diversity supports the high quality of life in the Northwest and is embodied by healthy runs of fish, diverse functioning forest ecosystems, clean drinking water, and inspirational recreational experiences to all those that visit the forest.
The Northwest is one of the best places to demonstrate that conservation and restoration can support thriving local communities.

We have a committed responsibility to efficiently and carefully utilize the valuable financial resources entrusted to us. 

Mount St. Helens is one of the most iconic mountains and active volcanos across the globe. Established as a National Volcanic Monument for research, recreation and education on August 27th, 1982 by President Ronald Reagan, Mt.

<h3>Help Us Share the Moke!</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p><em>Let the mountains talk, let the river run. Once more, and forever.</em>— David Brower<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1989, Sierra Nevada foothill residents founded the
<a href=""www.foothillconservancy.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Foothill Conservancy</a> to stop the 450-foot Devil’s Nose Dam, which would have
destroyed over nine miles of the wild North Fork Mokelumne River. Since that
first victory, we have become the leading organization in California for upper
Mokelumne River conservation. In 2009, we saved miles of the Mokelumne by
stopping one of the state’s largest water utilities from expanding Pardee
Reservoir. We use grassroots organizing, advocacy, and the occasional lawsuit to achieve our goals, always working with community and conservation partners. </p>
<p>Now, we need your help to protect the Mokelumne River for
good. Wild and Scenic River designation for 37 miles of the Moke would create a
protected river corridor more than 60 miles long. To achieve that goal, we are
raising money to purchase a fully outfitted raft. That will allow us to share
the river’s scenic beauty and wild nature with opinion leaders and public
officials whose support we need to protect our river for generations to come.</p>
<p>There is nothing like taking people out on our beloved
Moke to help them understand why we need to save this beautiful river. It’s
easy for them to ignore the wonders of the river if it’s only a line on the map
or something they see from its bridges. But once people raft the Mokelumne and
experience its beauty and its magic, they understand why we need to save it. </p>

By
contributing to the <b>Help Us Share the Moke</b> campaign you will help add the
Mokelumne to the list of approximately<span> 25 rivers and streams in California that have a portion of their reach protected by national or state Wild and Scenic
designation. This designation will protect the river forever – ensuring
that 37 miles of free-flowing stream benefit people, fish and wildlife for
generations to come. There is no better gift for your family, your children and
our Sierra Foothill communities than to ensure the Mokelumne stays a flowing river for
good. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<strong>HELP US SAVE SHARKS!  </strong>

</div><div> </div><p>Dr. Glenn R. Parsons,  <em><em>CFO Parsons Consulting</em></em> and Professor of Biology. </p><div>
</div><p>First, let me thank you for visiting our campaign web-site. Did you know that millions of sharks die each year as a result of commercial and recreational fishing? In many cases, the sharks are not wanted and are taken incidentally by swordfish and tuna fishers. Commercial and recreational fishers would love to have a method for preventing the capture of sharks. They are dangerous to handle, they damage fishing gear, and they slow down fishing operations thus reducing fishing efficiency. This capture of unwanted species is referred to as ""bycatch"". Bycatch is a global problem that plagues many fisheries, and scientists, partnered with commercial and recreational fishers, are working hard to develop methods to reduce bycatch.</p><div>
</div><p>I am Dr. Glenn R. Parsons,  CFO of Parsons Consulting LLC (a very small environmental consulting firm) and Professor of Biology. I hold degrees from The University of Alabama (Birmingham), The University of South Alabama, and The University of South Florida (St. Pete, School of Marine Science). I have researched the basic biology of sharks for the past 40 years along the coasts of Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi. Over the past approximately 15 years, I have focused on the problem of bycatch and recently turned my attention on shark bycatch in the tuna and swordfish fisheries. I feel that the work I am doing on bycatch is perhaps the most important research of my entire career.</p><div>
</div><p>As a professor an important part of my job is to train graduate students so they might conduct original research. My role as a mentor to students is without question the most gratifying (and, on occasion, the most frustrating) part of my responsibilities. I am very serious about that role and I have been very fortunate to have excellent undergraduate volunteers and superb graduate students. Training undergraduate and graduate students and conducting research is an expensive undertaking and, lately, funds for research have been difficult to obtain.</p><div>
</div><p><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</strong></p><div> </div><p></p><div>
</div><p>Our campaign is simple. At present we are using a boat to conduct bycatch research that is close to the end of its useful life. While our Carolina Skiff is still a good boat, it is 15 years old and starting to show its age in a number of ways. I am mounting this campaign to raise funds to purchase a boat that will allow us to expand our shark research projects and to accommodate a larger number of undergraduate and graduate students.</p><div>
</div><p>We will likely purchase another Carolina Skiff but the boat will be 24 feet long and will be better outfitted for the kind of research in which we are presently engaged. The boat will cost approximately $25,000.</p><div>
</div><p>We desperately need a new boat and your contribution will be a great help to us and may result in saving the lives of many thousands of sharks.</p><div>

This means that your shark will be tagged with a specially made tag that identifies the shark as adopted. We will send you all of the pertinent information concerning your shark, species, size, where captured, etc. When the animal is recaptured, the tag will inform the fisher that it is your shark and they are encouraged to report the location where captured and release the animal unharmed.

<p>At many of the South African nature reserves, the tourist
receive a more or less legible A4 paper map which can be quite a challenge to

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>After a very successful pilot study (the video contains data
of it) we endeavour to generate mobile maps for as many nature reserves and
game parks as possible.  At first the
focus will be on South Africa but we are hoping to expand this to other
southern African countries.  </p>
<p>The funds will be used to capture all the roads and buildings and
process the data.  There are quite a number of parks and reserves to be captured - US$ 3000 will not be nearly enough to capture all of them but will be a great help to get the project started. <br/></p><p>The processed data
will then be made available online for the public, free of charge.  One of the advantages is that a trip to one
of our nature reserves can be properly planned before actually arriving at the
nature reserve.  </p>
<p>As the reserves are captured we will post updates on the
campaign site as well as on other social media platforms.</p><p><br/></p>
<h1>Social spin-off<br/>
</h1>
<p>We believe that with proper mobiles maps we can draw more
tourist to our nature reserves, especially the not-so-well-known ones.  As reserves and game parks generally employ
people from the surrounding communities while an increase in tourists will
generate more job opportunities and local revenue.</p><p><br/></p>
<h1>Conservation spin-off<br/>
</h1>
<p>While the developed world struggles to obtain additional
land for conservation, the developing world has land under conservation, which
is not necessarily utilised optimally. It is expected that access to the route
information in these less well known reserves, will result in more visitors
which will contribute to more effective management of these reserves, which
often has limited resources compared to more well-known reserves such as the
Kruger National Park, Chobe or Serengeti.</p>
<p>These less well known reserves often conserve localised
populations of threatened biodiversity or very dramatic landscapes which
provide stepping stones and/or corridors for the general movement of
biodiversity. In South Africa for
instance, there are over 160 provincial and local nature reserves compared to
the 22 national parks, therefore there are eight times more provincial and
local reserves than national parks, with on average 17 provincial and local
reserves per province.</p>

Living Museum consists of a community of people living as humanity did for
countless generations, living in ""primitive"" shelters constructed
using available materials from the land and using ancient skills such as flint knapping,
hide tanning, fire by friction, basketry, pottery and so much more to make what
is needed for day to day living. There is no electricity, running water or
other comforts of modern living. It is a simple, wholesome lifestyle where what
we need comes from the land and we use only what we can create ourselves. The
village will have its own gardens with foods grown organically and sustainably
as well as extensive use of wild edible and medicinal plants. An underlying
theme of the entire community is ""caretaking"", an approach in which
we use the things we need from the land in a way that helps the natural world
instead of just taking what we want without regard for its impact. We also
accept these gifts from the land with gratitude which helps us focus on our

all the tools and other things needed to live off the land. We are working on
the designs and will be building community areas including a long house,
gardens and areas to work on specific 

skills such as flint knapping and hide
tanning, a primitive archery range, bow making workshop and tracking areas. All
of these things we can do without cost, but there are other projects on the
land that are necessary for us to open to the public which do require funding.
Currently our entry road is only dirt which makes it inaccessible during wet
weather- something we have plenty of around here! We've applied for a donation
of the gravel needed but need donations to complete the road; paying for hauling
the gravel and the bulldozer work that needs to be done for its completion. In
addition we need to install a well and restroom facilities. We have the skills
to create the village, but without your help, we cannot complete the projects
needed to begin to share this experience with the public. We have a large local
event planned for April and your donation will also help demonstrate that
others find this project of value and help us leverage donations from the local
community.",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>Why Does the Wiki Focus On Agroforestry?</b></p>
<p>Multistrata agroforestry systems go by many names - food forests, edible forest gardens, tropical homegardens, and more. What they have in common is their structure - multiple layers of vegetation, typically one or more layers of trees, with further layers of shrubs, vines, herbaceous species, and often fungi and/or livestock.</p>
<p>These “agroforests” can be at a tiny backyard scale or big enough to cover 50-70% of entire islands. Contemporary commercial examples include coffee and cacao under nitrogen-fixing shade trees. Multistrata systems go back 13,000 years in Java, and today are practiced on an estimated 100 million hectares globally (247 million acres), mostly in the humid tropics. Home-scale systems appear quite viable in cold climates, but models of commercial cold-climate hard to find - in deed development of such systems is one of our goals.</p>

<p>Scientists have called tropical homegardens “the epitome of sustainability” and have identified many benefits of these systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multistrata agroforestry systems sequester outstanding amounts of carbon - some as high as 40 tons per hectare per year (t/ha/yr). This compares extremely favorably with often-recommended carbon farming strategies like no-till (0.3 t/ha), “regenerative organic” annual crops (2.3), and managed grazing (0.3). Some even sequester carbon at faster rates than adjacent natural forest!</li>
<li>

<p>What are some examples? Well, around the world we see the pattern of nitrogen-fixing trees being used as living trellises for edible vines. Wherever you live, this could work for you.

</div></div>","Who We Are and Why We're Doing This?
Our goal is to transform agriculture and mitigate climate change. We believe we can do this while providing food and other products through the creation of agroecosystems that function at the highest level of biodiversity and ecosystem services - the “epitome of sustainability.”



The Apios Institute, the organization running this campaign, exists to share experience and information about perennial crop polyculture systems in all climates of the world. The Apios Institute works through a collaborative network of farmers, gardeners, and researchers, sharing inspiration and filling critical knowledge gaps regarding the design and management of these systems.
Our current Wiki has worked for thousands of people in cold climates -- but it is incomplete. Many people around the world have asked us to expand to include other climates. 
Our all-volunteer team has been hard at work since 2007. We are all practitioners and “plant geeks”. None of our board have ever been paid, nor do we have paid staff. Apios revenues come through memberships and sponsorships, and 100% of these funds go to pay for web hosting and design. 


For a taste of the amazing wiki our members have already created, check out these top pages:

Perennial Crops
• Asimina triloba - pawpaw - Banana-custard flavored cold-hardy fruit!
• Castanea pumila - Chinquapin chestnut. A sweet and productive bush nut.

• Dioscorea polystachya - Chinese yam. A hardy relative of the tropical yams. An excellent perennial vine root crop.
• Chenopodium bonus-henricus - Good King Henry. A perennial lead anf shoot vegetable for partial shade.
Food Forest Sites
• Central Rocky Mountain Permaculture. A high-desert, cold-climate perennial polyculture market garden and demonstration center.
Polycultures
• Butternut-Concord Grape. A living trellis polyculture producing nuts and fruit.
• Turkish rocket broccoli production polyculture. A productive perennial vegetable system!

Why Does the Wiki Focus On Agroforestry?
Multistrata agroforestry systems go by many names - food forests, edible forest gardens, tropical homegardens, and more. What they have in common is their structure - multiple layers of vegetation, typically one or more layers of trees, with further layers of shrubs, vines, herbaceous species, and often fungi and/or livestock.
These “agroforests” can be at a tiny backyard scale or big enough to cover 50-70% of entire islands. Contemporary commercial examples include coffee and cacao under nitrogen-fixing shade trees. Multistrata systems go back 13,000 years in Java, and today are practiced on an estimated 100 million hectares globally (247 million acres), mostly in the humid tropics. Home-scale systems appear quite viable in cold climates, but models of commercial cold-climate hard to find - in deed development of such systems is one of our goals.




Scientists have called tropical homegardens “the epitome of sustainability” and have identified many benefits of these systems:

Multistrata agroforestry systems sequester outstanding amounts of carbon - some as high as 40 tons per hectare per year (t/ha/yr). This compares extremely favorably with often-recommended carbon farming strategies like no-till (0.3 t/ha), “regenerative organic” annual crops (2.3), and managed grazing (0.3). Some even sequester carbon at faster rates than adjacent natural forest!

Tropical homegardens have the highest levels of biodiversity of any human land management technique. For example, Mesoamerican homegardens average 348 species per hectares (149/acre).

In some cases these systems produce more food than monocultures - sometimes much more! For example, in Brazilian oil palm monocultures, oil yields average 5 t/ha. Polycultures of oil palm, with the addition of fruiting vines, nitrogen-fixing trees, and other elements, produce 8.7 t/ha of oil, plus the additional products!

The very complexity that makes these systems so fantastic makes them hard to study, and greatly slows their spread. Outside of the tropics models are few and far between.
How Does the Wiki Address Crops and Polycultures?
Polycultures (“guilds” to permaculture practitioners) are cultivated plant systems which include at least two species. They are generally designed for minimum competition and maximum cooperation between the component species. They also need to be optimized for easy harvest and management.
Polycultures are the building block of multistrata agroforestry systems. Large farm- and landscape-scale systems may repeat one polyculture across the landscape, while smaller home-scale systems are a patchwork mosaic of polycultures. However, resources to help design perennial polycultures are few and far between, regardless of climate.


We founded the Apios Institute to address the challenges we’ve heard over and over from practitioners and aspiring practitioners. These seem to be the case across climates, at least where intact tropical homegardening traditions are not widespread.

It is hard to find information on perennial crops and support species, the great majority of which are rare in cultivation.
It is sometimes very challenging to combine species into polycultures.
Few case studies of gardens, farms, and productive wild “reference ecosystems” are available for use as models or inspiration.

Apios is a place for growers and enthusiasts to share personal experience, observation, and research. How do these crops perform for you? What polycultures have you planted, and how are they working out? What’s the design of your site, and what have you learned from it about establishment and ongoing maintenance? Apios contributors, as “roving reporters”, also share observations of gardens, farms, and wild ecosystems of interest that they visit (even if they themselves have no garden or farm at the moment). 


Why collect sample polycultures? First, it is challenging to design new ones, and borrowing open-source designs from others is a great place to start. Members will be able to search for polycultures suited to their site (climate, soils) and their goals (fruit production, nitrogen-fixation, etc). Searching for fruiting shrub polycultures for cold and dry or humid tropical climates will greatly stimulate adoption of these practices.
How Is the Wiki Organizing Polyculture Data?
There is another even more compelling argument for collecting sample polycultures. It is becoming clear to us that, while there may be an infinite number of possible polycultures, they seem to cluster under a few basic patterns.  The redesign of the wiki will include these basic clusters, and enable tagging so that together we can develop an international user-generated pattern language of polycultures.

The overall estimated cost of this wiki transformation is $15,000.

We are aiming to raise $10,000 from this campaign. Every dollar counts! If we exceed our goal we can make more, and more rapid, changes.

<li>How one MAGIC partition equals up to 6 competitive inventory items.</li>
<li>What makes MAGIC’s shipping product similar to the Golden Gate Bridge.</li>
<li>How MAGIC can save up to 80% of storage space.</li>
<li>How easy it is to become a MAGIC Stakeholder.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Section 1 - The Campaign for MAGIC Packaging Reducing EPS Foam in Landfills</strong></p><p>Millions of cubic feet of foam end up in US landfills yearly discarded from consumer direct Wine and Beer shipments. Magic Packaging (MAGIC) has a preliminary patent for an environmentally friendly, 100% recyclable packaging product. Our die cut shipping partition is made with materials that contain recycled materials that will be marketed to companies interested in opportunities to save natural resources with “Green” sustainable solutions. The initial products are for wineries, breweries and third party fulfillment companies that ship wine and beer direct to consumers using parcel delivery services. The MAGIC Partition will save the business 50%-80% in storage space and cost no more than existing shipping systems. MAGIC and its distributor have invested over $20,000.00 (materials, tools, testing) and devoted almost 2,000 hours to develop the patentable design that will be used for many packaging and shipping needs in the future. In addition to the provisional patent for the design, MAGIC has registered the trademark “GOT MAGIC?” and completed the necessary ISTA* tests for wine and beer package shipping.</p><p><i>*ISTA – International Safe Transit Association</i></p><p><strong>Section 2 - MAGIC vs. Other Shippers/Materials</strong></p><p>MAGIC has designed a bottle partition to be used inside a corrugated outer shipping box that incorporates similar physics to a suspension bridge where forces acting on the bottles contained in the shipping system are redirected into the shipping box, as the bridge would redirect force into the earth. This design protects the bottle(s) from each other and outside impacts. The “patent pending” technology eliminates the need for bulkier space consuming products like non-recyclable foam, molded pulp/fiber or other void fill materials. A more in-depth description follows (in Sec. 5).</p><p><strong>Section 3 - Use of Donor Funds</strong> </p><p>The majority of the money will be for product production - die cut corrugated and sized recyclable plastic for initial inventory – the partitions will need to be purchased in truckload volumes (60,000+ units) and each size of boxes in volumes of 10,000 to be price competitive. Some funds will be used to purchase dies for the partitions, specially designed heat sealers and environmentally friendly strapping equipment.</p><p>MAGIC has a relationship with an existing packaging distributor that has invested a lot of money and time in the development of our partition. This distributor has many years of experience with the food and hospitality industries, big box and internet retailers, and the beverage industry and will have the responsibility of channel sales, marketing, and logistics for MAGIC brand products. </p><p><strong>Section 4 – MAGIC   vs.        Existing Wine/Beer shipper partitions</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487279100/n8df8bn6cepg70mc5yel.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>    </p><div><div><div>

How easy it is to become a MAGIC Stakeholder.
Section 1 - The Campaign for MAGIC Packaging Reducing EPS Foam in LandfillsMillions of cubic feet of foam end up in US landfills yearly discarded from consumer direct Wine and Beer shipments. Magic Packaging (MAGIC) has a preliminary patent for an environmentally friendly, 100% recyclable packaging product. Our die cut shipping partition is made with materials that contain recycled materials that will be marketed to companies interested in opportunities to save natural resources with “Green” sustainable solutions. The initial products are for wineries, breweries and third party fulfillment companies that ship wine and beer direct to consumers using parcel delivery services. The MAGIC Partition will save the business 50%-80% in storage space and cost no more than existing shipping systems. MAGIC and its distributor have invested over $20,000.00 (materials, tools, testing) and devoted almost 2,000 hours to develop the patentable design that will be used for many packaging and shipping needs in the future. In addition to the provisional patent for the design, MAGIC has registered the trademark “GOT MAGIC?” and completed the necessary ISTA* tests for wine and beer package shipping.*ISTA – International Safe Transit AssociationSection 2 - MAGIC vs. Other Shippers/MaterialsMAGIC has designed a bottle partition to be used inside a corrugated outer shipping box that incorporates similar physics to a suspension bridge where forces acting on the bottles contained in the shipping system are redirected into the shipping box, as the bridge would redirect force into the earth. This design protects the bottle(s) from each other and outside impacts. The “patent pending” technology eliminates the need for bulkier space consuming products like non-recyclable foam, molded pulp/fiber or other void fill materials. A more in-depth description follows (in Sec. 5).Section 3 - Use of Donor Funds The majority of the money will be for product production - die cut corrugated and sized recyclable plastic for initial inventory – the partitions will need to be purchased in truckload volumes (60,000+ units) and each size of boxes in volumes of 10,000 to be price competitive. Some funds will be used to purchase dies for the partitions, specially designed heat sealers and environmentally friendly strapping equipment.MAGIC has a relationship with an existing packaging distributor that has invested a lot of money and time in the development of our partition. This distributor has many years of experience with the food and hospitality industries, big box and internet retailers, and the beverage industry and will have the responsibility of channel sales, marketing, and logistics for MAGIC brand products. Section 4 – MAGIC   vs.        Existing Wine/Beer shipper partitions

<p>A mysterious seabird, trying to survive and raise its fluffy
chicks against many human-related threats…Yelkouan shearwater is one of the
most secretive and yet a threatened seabird species in the Mediterranean Basin.
Turkey has high potential in terms of breeding Yelkouan pairs yet any
discovered colony mainly due to the difficulty of the fieldwork. </p>
<p>I am planning to undertake an intensive fieldwork with
comprehensive techniques in Turkish Aegean coast with the aim of locating
breeding grounds of these vulnerable species. </p>
<p>I am a biologist and a seabird lover, passionate about Yelkouan
shearwaters. I am studying this species in the Bosporus since 2010. Currently I
am a PhD student in Bogazici University.</p>
<p><b>The Bird (Yelkouan
Shearwater)</b></p>
<p>These remarkable birds are close relatives of albatrosses
and endemic to the Mediterranean Basin. There are many unknowns about this
species such as its precise distribution and breeding locations.  </p>
<p>Yelkouans are breeding on remote and rocky coastal and
offshore islets, and on the mainland. These birds often chose well-hidden
burrows and crevices in mostly inaccessible parts of the islands and visit
breeding colonies only at night in order to protect their eggs from predators.
For this reasons, locating breeding sites is very though job. </p>
<p>Turkey has high potential in terms of breeding Yelkouan
shearwater colonies thanks to relatively abundant pelagic fish species in its
unique marine environment and its long coastline. Yelkouans are plentiful in
Turkey; we broke a record last year and counted <a href=""http://yelkouanshearwater.org/en/new-record/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">90000</a> birds flying towards the
Aegean in 4 hours. Yelkouans are migrating to Black Sea after raised their
chicks and then spreading back to their breeding colonies in winter. It is
commonplace to encounter Yelkouans in Turkish waters during the year yet the
breeding grounds remain mystery.</p>
<p>Like many seabird species, Yelkouan shearwaters face with
rapid global population decline, because we are over-exploiting their food
resources (fish) and breeding grounds (coastal habitats) and because we are
introducing predators (rats), which are steeling the one and only egg of these
seabirds in breeding colonies. </p>
<p><b>The Work (Discovery)</b></p>
<p>Despite the increasing number of ornithologists and bird
watchers in Turkey, to date, just a small number of researchers had intended to
discover Yelkouan colonies. They all failed because of the difficulty of this
work and limited techniques they used. In this project I am planning to use
wide range of techniques in order to locate these birds’ breeding sites.</p>
<p>The planned work contains rope access and night work at
cliffs on remote islands. I will be inspecting all vertical cliff faces in
order to find suitable burrows and crevices by abseiling from the top of the
islands during the day. As many islands that I will work have high sea-facing cliffs, it
is impossible to access some parts without rope work. </p>
<p>As Yelkouans are active at night, in order to increase the
efficiency of this work I will be spending a whole week on each island without
any access to basic living conditions. I will listen out for prospecting birds visiting their nests during the night and also locate sound recorders in order to increase the effort.</p>
<p><b>The Needs </b></p>
<p>I only need good equipment to conduct this project.
Shearwater colony fieldwork requires rope access and night work on remote
islands. Thus I will spend a whole week in each small and remote island during
winter months and probably face with strong weather and living conditions. I
need good climbing and camping equipment in order to secure myself during the
fieldwork. </p><p>A detailed list of these equipments can be found <a href=""http://goo.gl/KXpRFJ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>The Impact </b></p>
<p>First of all your contribution will encourage young
researchers -especially female ones- to implement even such difficult and
extreme work in Turkey.</p>
<p>With this campaign, you will not only contribute to the
discovery of breeding colonies which is a long-lasting plea from European
conservationists but also you will lead a long-term conservation project on Yelkouan
shearwaters in Turkey -in the case I succeed.</p>
<p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p>
<p>If I fail to reach my goal, I will still go for this
discovery by paying as much as possible on my own for necessary equipment but
apparently it will be ill equipped thus carrying high risks. </p>

<h3><b>The Project</b></h3>
<p>The Earth is currently experiencing a mass extinction, fueled by alterations in the earth’s atmosphere, rapid land development, and resource mismanagement. In the process, we are losing crucial systems which will need to be recovered by the restoration ecologists of tomorrow. But those scientists will require an identifiable historical standard to work from.</p>
<p><strong>RARE Tomorrow</strong> is a non-profit organization creating a virtual reality archive of critically endangered ecosystems. Put simply, we design fully immersive references to guide future scientists tasked with restoring ecological systems, as well as to educate people today.  </p>
<p>In 2018 we completed the field work for the Washington State feasibility project and in 2019 began engineering the online VR platform. The field team will continue their work in 2020 with the filming of all critically endangered ecosystems found in the contiguous United States. RARE Tomorrow will debut the Washington State pilot project in the fall of 2020, with the rest of the contiguous US to follow in the winter of 2021.</p>
<p>We’ve already raised half of the field budget. All we need now is 30,000 dollars to ensure we can successfully capture each of the critically endangered systems. We hope to have the funding in place to be able to start fieldwork in time for summer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>We are keeping this simple. First, we have two ways to show your support to the world around you, a sticker and a badge. We're pretty excited about both, but to be honest that badge really does something to all of us here at RARE. Might be all those merit badges we didn't earn. Then at the founding member level and above, you’ll receive a gorgeous, one-of-a-kind landscape photo of one of the endangered sites you’re helping to preserve, plus a badge to stitch onto your backpack. Just a little something to remind you of the important work you’re helping to fund. </p>
<p>At all levels of support, your names will be added to the list of people who helped create this crucial archive, but let’s be honest; the real reward is to be part of an international effort to save this visual information for the next generation. </p>
<p>If you don’t have the money to pitch in, share the link and spread the word. The more of your friends, family, and co-workers who know about this campaign, the better.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Honestly, the risks are low. We have the information and are building the relationships we need to make sure we have access to these landscapes. Our big hurdle is funding.</p>

of building materials and electricity, the need for massive amounts of wood for

<p>Hayvancılık, sürdürülebilir sebzecilik ve kültürler arası etkileşim, bu projenin hizmet ettiği ve esinlendiği başlıca alanlar. Yöresel hayvancılık, özellikle keçicilik ve üretim biçimleri özel ilgi alanımız. Bu bağlamda peynir sevdalısıyız:)</p>
<p>Bu proje için farklı ülkelerden birçok insan gönüllü olarak çalıştı. Projenin bir amacı da, sürdürülebilir kırsal yaşam deneyimlerimizi daha çok gönüllüyle paylaşmak. Burada ağırlayacağımız misafirler, sadece gözlemci değil aynı zamanda gönüllü katılımcılar olacaklar.</p>
<p>Hep birlikte atölye çalışmaları ve festivaller düzenlemek, hayvancılık ve süt ürünleri alanlarında araştırmalar yapmak, doğal malzemelerle barınak yapımı için projeler oluşturmak, gönüllülük prensiplerinin kültürler arası etkileşimini araştırmak ve arttırmak istiyoruz.</p>
<p><b>Doğal malzemelerle barınak yapımı Sürdürülebilir Kırsal Yaşam Projesinin bir parçasıdır. </b></p>
<p>Proje dahilinde bir kerpiç ev tamamladık. Çalışma alanımızda, evin hemen yanından çıkartılan toprak, dereden akan su ve komşu tarlalarda üretilen buğdayların samanı kullanıldı. </p>
<p>Taş ve kerpiçten yapılan bir diğer doğal yapı ise gönüllü eviydi. Bu evin içerisine yöresel ve geleneksel bir barınma biçimi olan keçi kılından yapılma çadırlar koymaya karar verdik. Köyde sayıları azalmış olsa da hala kıldan çul dokuyan nineler var. Yerel ve doğal malzemelerle hazırlanacak kıl çadırlarda gönüllü ziyaretçilerimizi ağırlayabileceğiz.</p>
<p><b>2013 Ağustos ayında başlayan çalışmalar sonunda projenin %90'ını, Tangala Keçi Çiftliği'nde gönülden gayretle çalışan bir kaç hayalperest olarak tamamladık.</b></p>
<p>Kerpiç Ev: Keçilerin serbest yaşadıkları 2,5 dönüm alan içerisinde 35 m2 bir kerpiç ev(tamamlandı)</p>
<p>Peynir Atölyesi: Gönüllü evinin altında 60 m2 peynir atölyesi ve mahzen (tamamlandı)</p>
<p>Gönüllü Evi: 220 m2 gönüllü evinin içinde bir ortak tuvalet/banyo ve iki kıl çadır,mutfak ve toplantı alanı (İnşaat tamamlandı, iç bölümlerde eksikler var)</p>

<p>* Zemin ve çadırlar için kıl çulların ördürülmesi.</p>
<p>* Kıl çadırların dikilmesi.</p>
<p>* Ortak mutfak ve tuvalet / banyo kaba inşaatı tamamlandı. Mekan içi eksiklerin tamamlanması.</p>
<p>* Toplantılar ve atölye çalışmaları için kullanılacak olan ortak salonun ısıtma ve mutfak alt yapı ihtiyaçları.</p>
<p><b>Göstereceğiniz en ufak destek bile bizim için çok önemli. Şartlarınız elverdiği kadar maddi katkı sağlayabilir, projemizi FB ve Twitter'da duyurabilir, bize mesaj yazıp yüzümüzü güldürebilirsiniz!</b></p>

<p><b>What is the Rural Life Project? What does it serve to? Where does it take its inspiration?</b></p>
<p>Sustainable Rural LifeProject is an independent project which is hosted by Tangala Goat Farm. This project is initialized by the will, support and desire of a couple of volunteer people. </p>
<p>Because we love animals they are at the heart of our project. Regional animal breeding, specifically goat breeding and dairy farming is our special interest. Simply we are cheese lovers:)</p>
<p>Many volunteers all around the world worked in this project. One of the aims of this project is to share our sustainable rural living experiences with more volunteers. In this project the guests will not only be observers but in the mean time will be voluntary participants.</p>
<p>We want to organize workshops and festivals, make research on animal breeding and dairy products, organize and support sheltering projects with natural materials, make contribution to the cross-cultural interaction of voluntary principles. </p>
<p><b>Making shelter with natural materials is a part of Sustainable Rural Life Project.</b></p>
<p>We constructed a cob house during this project. In our work area we used the soil from the land, the water from the trench and the straw bales from the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Another construction made with natural materials is a guesthouse. We decided to put goat hair tents into a stone/mud house that we build. The old women of the village knit these tents with traditional methods from goat hair. We will be able to host our volunteer guests in these tents. </p>
<p><b>This project started running in August 2013 and we –a couple of dreamers- completed 90% of the project by “heart working” in Tangala Goat Farm.</b></p>
<p>Cob House: 35m2 cob house located in the 2,5 hectares of land where the goats live freely (completed)</p>
<p>Cheese make room:Under the guest house there is another unit with a cheese make room and cellar inside (completed)</p>
<p>Guesthouse: 220m2 stone building with 2 tents, a kitchen, a bathroom and a meeting area (Construction completed, still working on the interior construction and set up.)  </p>
<p><b>Now for the parts that are incomplete we would like to make a call for those who would like to contribute. With your contribution the guesthouse will be completed;</b></p>
<p>• Women will thread yarn from goat hair and knit the haircloths</p>
<p>• The tents will be produced</p>
<p>• Common kitchen and toilet construction is complete; the interior construction will be finished.</p>
<p>• The groundwork for heating and kitchen of common area, which will function as a meeting, festival, presentation and workshop unit, will be finalized.</p>
<p><b>Even a little contribution will be much appreciated. You can contribute by financial support, by broadcasting our project on FB and Twitter or you can send us a message just to make us smile!</b></p>
<p>We also prepared some gifts for some amounts of support. You can find more information on the right side of the project page.</p>

Hayvancılık, sürdürülebilir sebzecilik ve kültürler arası etkileşim, bu projenin hizmet ettiği ve esinlendiği başlıca alanlar. Yöresel hayvancılık, özellikle keçicilik ve üretim biçimleri özel ilgi alanımız. Bu bağlamda peynir sevdalısıyız:)
Bu proje için farklı ülkelerden birçok insan gönüllü olarak çalıştı. Projenin bir amacı da, sürdürülebilir kırsal yaşam deneyimlerimizi daha çok gönüllüyle paylaşmak. Burada ağırlayacağımız misafirler, sadece gözlemci değil aynı zamanda gönüllü katılımcılar olacaklar.
Hep birlikte atölye çalışmaları ve festivaller düzenlemek, hayvancılık ve süt ürünleri alanlarında araştırmalar yapmak, doğal malzemelerle barınak yapımı için projeler oluşturmak, gönüllülük prensiplerinin kültürler arası etkileşimini araştırmak ve arttırmak istiyoruz.
Doğal malzemelerle barınak yapımı Sürdürülebilir Kırsal Yaşam Projesinin bir parçasıdır. 
Proje dahilinde bir kerpiç ev tamamladık. Çalışma alanımızda, evin hemen yanından çıkartılan toprak, dereden akan su ve komşu tarlalarda üretilen buğdayların samanı kullanıldı. 
Taş ve kerpiçten yapılan bir diğer doğal yapı ise gönüllü eviydi. Bu evin içerisine yöresel ve geleneksel bir barınma biçimi olan keçi kılından yapılma çadırlar koymaya karar verdik. Köyde sayıları azalmış olsa da hala kıldan çul dokuyan nineler var. Yerel ve doğal malzemelerle hazırlanacak kıl çadırlarda gönüllü ziyaretçilerimizi ağırlayabileceğiz.
2013 Ağustos ayında başlayan çalışmalar sonunda projenin %90'ını, Tangala Keçi Çiftliği'nde gönülden gayretle çalışan bir kaç hayalperest olarak tamamladık.
Kerpiç Ev: Keçilerin serbest yaşadıkları 2,5 dönüm alan içerisinde 35 m2 bir kerpiç ev(tamamlandı)
Peynir Atölyesi: Gönüllü evinin altında 60 m2 peynir atölyesi ve mahzen (tamamlandı)
Gönüllü Evi: 220 m2 gönüllü evinin içinde bir ortak tuvalet/banyo ve iki kıl çadır,mutfak ve toplantı alanı (İnşaat tamamlandı, iç bölümlerde eksikler var)
Şimdi kalan eksiklerimiz için destek olmak isteyebileceklere bir çağrıda bulunmak istiyoruz. Desteğiniz ile gönüllü evinin aşağıdaki eksikleri tamamlanacak;
* Zemin ve çadırlar için kıl çulların ördürülmesi.
* Kıl çadırların dikilmesi.
* Ortak mutfak ve tuvalet / banyo kaba inşaatı tamamlandı. Mekan içi eksiklerin tamamlanması.
* Toplantılar ve atölye çalışmaları için kullanılacak olan ortak salonun ısıtma ve mutfak alt yapı ihtiyaçları.
Göstereceğiniz en ufak destek bile bizim için çok önemli. Şartlarınız elverdiği kadar maddi katkı sağlayabilir, projemizi FB ve Twitter'da duyurabilir, bize mesaj yazıp yüzümüzü güldürebilirsiniz!
Projemize belli miktarlarda destek olmak isteyenler için birkaç armağan da hazırladık, bunları proje sayfasının sağında görebilirsiniz.

What is the Rural Life Project? What does it serve to? Where does it take its inspiration?
Sustainable Rural LifeProject is an independent project which is hosted by Tangala Goat Farm. This project is initialized by the will, support and desire of a couple of volunteer people. 
Because we love animals they are at the heart of our project. Regional animal breeding, specifically goat breeding and dairy farming is our special interest. Simply we are cheese lovers:)
Many volunteers all around the world worked in this project. One of the aims of this project is to share our sustainable rural living experiences with more volunteers. In this project the guests will not only be observers but in the mean time will be voluntary participants.
We want to organize workshops and festivals, make research on animal breeding and dairy products, organize and support sheltering projects with natural materials, make contribution to the cross-cultural interaction of voluntary principles. 
Making shelter with natural materials is a part of Sustainable Rural Life Project.
We constructed a cob house during this project. In our work area we used the soil from the land, the water from the trench and the straw bales from the neighborhood.
Another construction made with natural materials is a guesthouse. We decided to put goat hair tents into a stone/mud house that we build. The old women of the village knit these tents with traditional methods from goat hair. We will be able to host our volunteer guests in these tents. 
This project started running in August 2013 and we –a couple of dreamers- completed 90% of the project by “heart working” in Tangala Goat Farm.
Cob House: 35m2 cob house located in the 2,5 hectares of land where the goats live freely (completed)
Cheese make room:Under the guest house there is another unit with a cheese make room and cellar inside (completed)
Guesthouse: 220m2 stone building with 2 tents, a kitchen, a bathroom and a meeting area (Construction completed, still working on the interior construction and set up.)  
Now for the parts that are incomplete we would like to make a call for those who would like to contribute. With your contribution the guesthouse will be completed;
• Women will thread yarn from goat hair and knit the haircloths
• The tents will be produced
• Common kitchen and toilet construction is complete; the interior construction will be finished.
• The groundwork for heating and kitchen of common area, which will function as a meeting, festival, presentation and workshop unit, will be finalized.
Even a little contribution will be much appreciated. You can contribute by financial support, by broadcasting our project on FB and Twitter or you can send us a message just to make us smile!
We also prepared some gifts for some amounts of support. You can find more information on the right side of the project page.
Share our project and let our voice be heard. Thank you so much.

<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am honored for the opportunity to write to you of my concerns:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There were 19 homes on the Schoharie Creek at Priddle Road in Esperance NY on August 28th, 2011.  With the advent of Hurricane Irene and the subsequent flooding two remained, one was abandoned.  So it is just that one.  It's been almost a year and things are getting worse.  Much worst than anything which you may  have heard.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>""Would you care to be involved in kind charitable contribution:  A donation itself to help re-establish someone in a life they formerly had?""</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My home on the creek and in my family for 43 years:  Gone; it was 21 feet high and the ""wave"" that came through the valley seemed to be 24 foot (as evidenced by ""burnishing and scouring marks"" left up on the larger trees that survived).  The NYS Water Authority said the water was travelling at 50 miles per hour!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Nothing was left:  About two or three weeks later while raking glass debris, asbestos, asphalt, fiberglass insulation, and other flood debris I realize it was ""my rake"" that was in the mud-room prior to the hurricane that I was using.  The house completely gone - and somehow the rake remained; how did that survive?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Otherwise a total loss:  No one else is re-building on the creek. The rebuild is estimated at $90,000.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Difficulties abound:  Even if I could afford to rebuild - It is a real concern for the increased tax burden.  I had ""grievance"" year after year to get the taxes (upon my retirement) down to about $100 per month.  So in every respect I cannot afford to rebuild anything too costly.  I am now in my 60's on a Social Security pension of $869/month.  That is a real difficulty.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When my home was first built it was only $5,500 and my father and I would improve it basically any way we wanted when we had the money to do so.  Now with all of the additional regulations everything is so costly it is prohibitive, (in every sense of the word).  My father since passed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My elder sister is an administrator for health care:  She presupposes that everyone there has a PTSD [Post Traumatic Syndrome Disorder].  She's probably right - as I feel ""crushed,"" actually ""frozen,"" and greatly troubled by the times.  I need some assistance and the more people I ask the less help I get.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Your involvement in this endeavor would not only be a Godsend, and greatly appreciated, yet it would also serve as an example of what can be done:  A good example.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It would encourage an entire community to rebuild.  This would endear an entire community to you.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Can you, would you help?</div>
<div>Kind regards, sincerely</div>
<div>Raymond Lucas</div>
<div> </div>
<div>P.S.  It has been reported that over 30 houses in that community have been destroyed.  And over 300 homes in the county (Schoharie).  I believe ""hand in hand"" it would be a great bit of charity:  Showing care and giving hope.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All of this devastation and destruction has not been reported well in the newspapers and media.  The houses being basically ""completely"" gone, makes for nothing to take (‘good’) photographs of:  No tilted houses, no ‘water-marks.’  As a result it has been largely over-looked, ignored, and that is a shame; and a pity.  Please make a presence of yourself.  I hope Mr. Sean Penn or Mr. Robert DeNiro will read this.  God will never forget.  And I for one will be grateful forever.</div>
<div>* * *</div>
<div> I come from the building trade in roofing, siding, and framing.  But at my age ""I can’t wrap my head around all that needs to be done.""  (I can still pound nails.)  Pardon, I don't like to admit that but I feel lost.  I am living with my daughter, in New Jersey and really want to get back Upstate New York.  I believe you may be able to empathize with my feelings.  In the community, I was the one that would help anyone and freely repair their leaking roofs.  While I have helped so many others - now, it is I who need help.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The new restrictions in “over”-building the foundation have my hands tied on the expenses of the home.  If you could provide any funds, I could do the roof, pay for the foundation, and be able to get in by the autumn sometime late.  Being benevolent and kind would only be seen as glorious in the eyes of The Lord.  Will you help, please?</div>

If we do not reach our goal the campaign will continue and we will use these funds to help find a match to support our intern.  As a project of part of the Earth Island Institute all funds are tax deductible to the extent  provided by the law. The ImpactProtecting sharks protects the health and balance of fish populations and marine ecosystems. Our short video and social media push during the swim will help the world recognize that sharks are in trouble world wide and need our help. Our Indiegogo last year helped us produce a short documentary Swim For Sharks (excerpted in last years trailer) screened in the San Francisco International Film Festival and elsewhere. We will be adding material from the swim to our high definition conservation adventure film to reach a broader market across the Pacific to raise global awareness for sharks.Other Ways You Can Help
Make some some noise about the Swim for Sharks campaign through twitter, Facbook, instagram and other social media.

<h3>What is Eco Karma?</h3>
<p>I've always been inspired by <strong>Karma Yoga</strong>, which is about finding your higher self in service to others. These teachings helped me develop <strong>Eco Karma Yoga</strong>: devoting our selves in service of nature.  Since 2014, I have been bringing yogis to ocean shores in Florida, Bali, Australia and Hawaii. We've cleaned beaches, transplanted coral and restored native plant habitats.  In the process, we have realized that our yoga is so much more than giving back to our bodies. </p>
<p>In <strong>2019</strong> we have eco karma projects lined up in <a href=""https://blissology.com/calendar/ecokarma-hawaii/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Hawaii</strong></a> and <a href=""https://blissology.com/calendar/ecokarma-bali/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Bali</strong></a>. We will remove plastic from the ocean, restore fish stocks and transplant coral. We will do it as a collective community, and commit to living our life with more awareness and kindness every day so we can reduce our impact on our planet.  </p>

<h3>Why the Coral Reefs?</h3>
<p>We are so intimately connected to the ocean. Every tear and every drop of sweat comes and goes from the ocean. Every second breath we take is produced by  plankton. Our oceans are the source of countless life forms. And within then, coral reefs are like the rain forests of the ocean.  They cover a mere 1% of the ocean floor yet are home to approximately 25% of all marine life!</p>
<p>Today coral reefs around the world are in danger.  Some estimates show how approximately 10% of the world's coral reefs are dead, and about 60% of the world's reefs are at risk due to human-related activities. By the 2030s, 90% of reefs are expected to be at risk from both human activities and climate change.</p>
<p>Connect to your Higher Porpoise!</p>
<p>The main work of my life is to make sure that Nature remains the deepest source of our mental, physical and spiritual health. I see the ocean as my temple and my playground.  Perhaps for you it's the mountains, or the rivers, or the lakes.  No matter what feeds your soul, I want us to connect our LOVE for ecology with both the physical yoga practice and selfless service of Karma yoga.  Thank you once again for fueling my birthday with LOVE.  </p>
<p>We so APPRECIATE YOU and are committed to living a life of mindful awareness so we can continue to leave our children and their children a sustainable home on which to dwell.  </p>

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Our Collective Problem:</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><img alt=""Disposable Waste"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/Yo8vT5n.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 524.024024024024px; height: 349px;""/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><em><strong>So... let’s put this waste not in the trash, but in the past!</strong></em></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As you know, </span><span>there are intense </span><span>environmental problems </span><span>like </span><span>climate change, plastics in our oceans, methane gas release</span><span>,</span><span> and other </span><span>real </span><span>issues that are difficult to </span><span>measure </span><span>on a daily basis. </span><span>However</span><span>,</span><span> <strong>retail consumer waste from single-use disposables</strong> (aka SUD) is very easy to see, feel and touch each day of our lives.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Did you know that on average each American uses <strong>500 disposable cups and 500 disposable bags per year.</strong>.. that’s over <strong>300 BILLION</strong> cups and bags per year!</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>The Massive Opportunity:</span></h2>
<p><span><img alt=""Reusable bag"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/hGofYzY.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 1px; width: 399px; height: 399px;""/><img alt=""Jared Reusables"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/MHU3QH4.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 1px; width: 403px; height: 403px;""/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Bringing reUSE Bags and reUSE Cups to every store we shop at!</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We have the opportunity to make a massive impact and </span><span>eventually </span><span>help </span><span>make single use disposable usage obsolete </span><span>from the </span><span>shopping </span><span>experience</span><span>. We can remove this waste from the </span><span>shopping</span><span> within this decade, if we decide to take action</span><span>s</span><span> now. Our kids could grow up in a world knowing that we stopped this habit of SUD waste and rid </span><span>our planet </span><span>of this pollution system all together.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are hundreds of thousands of cafes, markets, pharmacies, convenience, and retail stores </span><span>for us</span><span> to take action at. Millions already “check-in” to stores on mobile devices, share photos and their experiences. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em><strong>Simply adding a positive action to that check-in, can make a real difference.</strong></em></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><img alt=""TraX app at cafe"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/w4YljRD.png"" src="""" style=""margin: 1px; width: 481.98433420365535px; height: 325px;""/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When we choose reusables, we are saving a disposable cup or plastic bag, and making a powerful consumer statement. We are also helping to save stores costs in shipping, inventory, waste management, and negative public image.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If you already bring reusables to the stores, great work... </span><span>and</span><span> now TraX can help you quantify how much you’re helping us all. Plus, we can now r</span><span>eward </span><span>you with cash, gift cards or donations </span><span>for something you already do.  </span>Find out just how many SUDs you have saved from the trash. The is energy, waste, and natural resources you have saved, are now visualized. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are those of m</span><span>any of </span><span>us that </span><span>are NOT</span><span> taking these simple daily actions and for good reason... value. Your phone, keys, wallet all have inherent value to you, so you remember them when you head out each day. </span><span>We want to make your reusable cups, bags, and to-go containers just as valuable to you</span><span>.</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Our Solution:</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So we did just that... meet TraX, the first mobile app to track and reward your reusables everywhere </span><span>you shop, every day!</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><img alt=""TraX rewards page"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/tR6FcVg.png"" src="""" style=""margin: 1px;""/> </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>See real incentives are what move</span><span> us, pain debilitates us. The recent bans, fees, and penalties keep us in line... but they do not inspire us into action, they force it. This issue is not only about a reusable cup, bag or container (although we do have some sweet perks for you), it’s about changing patterns, and our everyday habits, and that can be tough for all of us.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We believe that by offering you cash credits for your actions, we can grow this movement towards reusables and then onwards towards even greater actions. Reusables is just the beginnging for TraX!</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>By contributing to this campaign you are saying:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><em><strong>YES to reusables </strong></em></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><em><strong>YES to being acknowledged </strong></em></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>It isn’t just about being green, it is about <strong>doing the right thing</strong>. The health of the planet, our kids and the future depends on us to do something positive today.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>TraX is an on-the-go</span><span> mobile </span><span>app that tracks your actions for you and rewards you </span><span>everywhere you already shop</span><span>.  </span>So, We are incentivizing you, not punishing you.  By rewarding you directly, giving credit everywhere credit is due TraX offers you a consistent experience at every store.</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>The TraX App: Features</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The initial version of the TraX mobile app will be released with the following:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><img alt=""TraX apps 5"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/gHpVOLh.png"" src="""" style=""margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 1px;""/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Welcome / Sign-in / Sign-up </strong><span><strong>-</strong> this is the landing page for the app to create a new account or to enter TraX. Easily sign up with Facebook, Twitter or email... it’s that simple.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>My Actions -</strong> TraX rewards you for reusables anytime that you offset SUD waste at stores when shopping. You self-track an action when using a qualifying reusable item. TraX partners then reward you for reusable bags, cups, to-go containers, bottles, garment bags, straws and cutlery sets. The app displays your in-store actions for you in real time.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>My Stores-</strong> TraX connects to the Foursquare database to access all US stores to help you locate names while shopping. Locations are a crucial component of TraX. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Reward Me</strong><span><strong>-</strong> This page displays your current </span><span>rewards </span><span>credit balance accrued </span><span>on a digital </span><span>Tango Card. Each action is valued at 25¢ </span><span>and </span><span>you will see the balance increase by that amount </span><span>for each TraX action you perform</span><span>. </span><span>Now you can redeem</span><span> for cash*, retail gift card* or donations to non-profit partners. You can </span><span>immediately start </span><span>redeeming rewards after your first action. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>*Redemption fees</em> - There is an 8% processing fee taken out for cash and donations in order to mail checks. <em>For example, if you have $10 to redeem as cash, you will personally receive a check for $9.20, minus this processing fee.</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><strong>Thank You's</strong> - Links to the store/company/brand that provided your 25¢ credit. Optional further information and contact details about the partner company is provided here also.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Share It -</strong><span> This page is about sharing your good deeds, viewing your impact and the rewards you are accruing by using TraX. This share page represents our early campaigns that you can start NOW. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><strong>Real Rewards-</strong> We offer you the chance to take a photo of your reusable, tag it with the TraX hashtags (#TraXcup, TraXbag, etc.), share your store location and post it to your favorite social site</span><span>s </span><span>(Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)</span><span>. This will h</span><span>elp </span><span>spread the word and let our partners know how active you are. </span></p>

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>FAQ Section:</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><em><strong>So...who pays for my 25¢ rewards?</strong></em></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The short answers is... it depends on where you track your reusavle. TraX plans to partner with large retail chain stores, small local stores, eco-product companies, and other sustainable organizations.  Depending on your action location, an appropriate partner will reward you </span><span>when you use the app</span><span>. For example, if you use a </span><span>reusable </span><span>shopping bag at a small retail store, that we have not partnered with yet, an eco-product partner will credit you.  If you use a reusable cup at a cafe chain we have partnered with, you will see a direct reward from that same company.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em><strong>Can I get rewarded for my actions NOW?</strong></em></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>YES...we are very proud of our founding partners, aligned brands, committed companies, and high integrity organizations to support your current actions.</span></p>

Our Collective Problem:

So... let’s put this waste not in the trash, but in the past!
As you know, there are intense environmental problems like climate change, plastics in our oceans, methane gas release, and other real issues that are difficult to measure on a daily basis. However, retail consumer waste from single-use disposables (aka SUD) is very easy to see, feel and touch each day of our lives.
Did you know that on average each American uses 500 disposable cups and 500 disposable bags per year... that’s over 300 BILLION cups and bags per year!
The Massive Opportunity:

Bringing reUSE Bags and reUSE Cups to every store we shop at!
We have the opportunity to make a massive impact and eventually help make single use disposable usage obsolete from the shopping experience. We can remove this waste from the shopping within this decade, if we decide to take actions now. Our kids could grow up in a world knowing that we stopped this habit of SUD waste and rid our planet of this pollution system all together.
There are hundreds of thousands of cafes, markets, pharmacies, convenience, and retail stores for us to take action at. Millions already “check-in” to stores on mobile devices, share photos and their experiences. 
Simply adding a positive action to that check-in, can make a real difference.

When we choose reusables, we are saving a disposable cup or plastic bag, and making a powerful consumer statement. We are also helping to save stores costs in shipping, inventory, waste management, and negative public image.
If you already bring reusables to the stores, great work... and now TraX can help you quantify how much you’re helping us all. Plus, we can now reward you with cash, gift cards or donations for something you already do.  Find out just how many SUDs you have saved from the trash. The is energy, waste, and natural resources you have saved, are now visualized. 
There are those of many of us that are NOT taking these simple daily actions and for good reason... value. Your phone, keys, wallet all have inherent value to you, so you remember them when you head out each day. We want to make your reusable cups, bags, and to-go containers just as valuable to you.
Our Solution:
So we did just that... meet TraX, the first mobile app to track and reward your reusables everywhere you shop, every day!
 
See real incentives are what move us, pain debilitates us. The recent bans, fees, and penalties keep us in line... but they do not inspire us into action, they force it. This issue is not only about a reusable cup, bag or container (although we do have some sweet perks for you), it’s about changing patterns, and our everyday habits, and that can be tough for all of us.
We believe that by offering you cash credits for your actions, we can grow this movement towards reusables and then onwards towards even greater actions. Reusables is just the beginnging for TraX!
By contributing to this campaign you are saying:


YES to reusables 


YES to being acknowledged 


YES to real action


YES to impact 



YES to removing SUD waste


YES to up $1 per day for actions you already do!


It isn’t just about being green, it is about doing the right thing. The health of the planet, our kids and the future depends on us to do something positive today.
TraX is an on-the-go mobile app that tracks your actions for you and rewards you everywhere you already shop.  So, We are incentivizing you, not punishing you.  By rewarding you directly, giving credit everywhere credit is due TraX offers you a consistent experience at every store.
The TraX App: Features
The initial version of the TraX mobile app will be released with the following:

Welcome / Sign-in / Sign-up - this is the landing page for the app to create a new account or to enter TraX. Easily sign up with Facebook, Twitter or email... it’s that simple.
My Actions - TraX rewards you for reusables anytime that you offset SUD waste at stores when shopping. You self-track an action when using a qualifying reusable item. TraX partners then reward you for reusable bags, cups, to-go containers, bottles, garment bags, straws and cutlery sets. The app displays your in-store actions for you in real time.
My Stores- TraX connects to the Foursquare database to access all US stores to help you locate names while shopping. Locations are a crucial component of TraX. 
Reward Me- This page displays your current rewards credit balance accrued on a digital Tango Card. Each action is valued at 25¢ and you will see the balance increase by that amount for each TraX action you perform. Now you can redeem for cash*, retail gift card* or donations to non-profit partners. You can immediately start redeeming rewards after your first action. 
*Redemption fees - There is an 8% processing fee taken out for cash and donations in order to mail checks. For example, if you have $10 to redeem as cash, you will personally receive a check for $9.20, minus this processing fee.
Thank You's - Links to the store/company/brand that provided your 25¢ credit. Optional further information and contact details about the partner company is provided here also.  
Share It - This page is about sharing your good deeds, viewing your impact and the rewards you are accruing by using TraX. This share page represents our early campaigns that you can start NOW. 
Real Rewards- We offer you the chance to take a photo of your reusable, tag it with the TraX hashtags (#TraXcup, TraXbag, etc.), share your store location and post it to your favorite social sites (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). This will help spread the word and let our partners know how active you are.

FAQ Section:
So...who pays for my 25¢ rewards?
The short answers is... it depends on where you track your reusavle. TraX plans to partner with large retail chain stores, small local stores, eco-product companies, and other sustainable organizations.  Depending on your action location, an appropriate partner will reward you when you use the app. For example, if you use a reusable shopping bag at a small retail store, that we have not partnered with yet, an eco-product partner will credit you.  If you use a reusable cup at a cafe chain we have partnered with, you will see a direct reward from that same company.  
Can I get rewarded for my actions NOW?
YES...we are very proud of our founding partners, aligned brands, committed companies, and high integrity organizations to support your current actions.


ChicoBags - The best reusable and packable bags on the planet.

Recycling, composting, biking/walking/carpooling to work, and other wonderfully helpful actions.  We can not reward you for these actions, since there are often no purchase based aroud it. We can recommend some other wonderful apps, simply email us for more help. 


What’s the $50k needed for?
We have created the wireframes and prototypes of the mobile app and now it is time to develop it, to get it into your hands.  Experience matters, so we are leaning on the talents of a great local firm in SF, for the first versions of TraX.

animator to produce an engaging animation drawing attention to the problem.
 
Our aims
We want people to be galvanized by seeing our
animation – and cause Government to sit up and take notice. We’ll be pushing
its message as widely as possible – working with interested partner
organisations, such as ChinaDialogue, who have offered to translate the
animation into Chinese. And we want to see political change: for Government to
start counting our outsourced emissions – and begin tackling the impacts of
consumption.
 
Where the money will go
PIRC is an independent charity that takes no
funding from Government or business. The money you donate will go solely
towards paying an animator to create our animation. 
 
Help in other ways 
We need your help with raising money to produce the
animation. But we’d also like your help in other ways: please use the sharing
tools on this website to spread the word about our project and the problem it’s
trying to address. And please contact us if you want to offer help or have any
suggestions: info [at] pirc.info",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b><i>What’s going on in Poland and why do you care?</i></b></p>
<p>In November the UN Climate Change Conference (COP-19) will be held in Warsaw. After the disappointing outcome of the 2009 Copenhagen summit, media have started to dedicate less and less attention to the coverage of the negotiations and many are doubtful about the chances of any breakthroughs in Warsaw. Yet, given the gravity of the unfolding climate crisis, we believe that there's no better justification to put the media spotlight on the only global policy arena on climate change.</p>
<p><b><i>So nobody cares about the talks. What are you going to do about it?</i></b></p>
<p>We believe that the media play a crucial role in spreading knowledge and creating awareness around climate change. Not only we can do something, but we think it is our duty to do so. In the last years, coverage of the climate talks has been largely confined to dispatches from (mostly Western) international news agencies. Instead, we will be there, and in many other places around the world at the same time, bringing to you the latest developments from the conference and live reactions from policymakers, activists and experts around the world. We will share with you what climate change means to the people, the environment and the economies of our countries, what problems and solutions are discussed and how they are told in different media.</p>
<p><b><i>How’s this ‘mosaic’ going to work?</i></b></p>
<p>With your help, three of our team members will travel to Warsaw to cover the climate summit on the ground. The others, meanwhile, will be reporting on the conference from their own country. Each of the project participants commits to a minimum of stories produced and published as a result of the project, yielding no less than 25 pieces - textual, audio, video or cross-media - published in various national and international publications.</p>
<p><b><i>…and what’s so special about it?</i></b></p>
<p>Wait! Not done yet. The three journalists in Warsaw will also moderate a live-blog that all the members of CNM will update constantly with snippets of interviews, photos, statements and any sort of information they will gather for their own articles, radio or TV pieces. Any reporter following the CNM live-blog will be able to access, strictly for free and from their own desk, a continuous flow of content coming from all corners of the world. Besides, we encourage other media outlets to pick up this reporting, in part or in full. And editors will be able to commission stories from CNM members. The result will be an innovative, ‘glocal’ approach to environmental journalism that combines cross-border cooperation and new technologies to enhance and deliver quality information. A mosaic of local perspectives to give you the global picture.</p>
<p><b><i>What do I get if I donate?</i></b></p>
<p>Several things. A big thank you, a postcard from Warsaw, an e-book or a Google Hangout session with us (see details on the right). But most of all you will allow a team of independent and committed journalists to challenge the way climate change has been reported in the media. This isn't just about you, or us. Climate change affects everyone's life and it therefore requires awareness and action from all of us. Here is your chance to add your own piece to the mosaic.</p>
<p><b><i>What do you gain out of it?</i></b></p>
<p>Strictly speaking, nothing. All our members are working journalists and will be covering the conference for the outlets they collaborate with. All the money we raise will be used to fund the costs of the project and no salary will be added to it.</p>
<p><b><i>Why do you bother, then?</i></b></p>
<p>As journalists, it is our job to inform you. As citizens, it is our will to create awareness around a topic that will impact all our lives. As professionals, we have the tools to do it well, and we will.</p>
<p>Hope you’ll join us!</p>
<p><b><i>Fine, you convinced me! How can I help?</i></b></p>
<p>Obviously, you can donate, but please do let others know that you did. Actually, even if you cannot make a financial contribution, spreading the word about this project would already help us a lot. Use Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, and any other platform you can think of to talk about us.</p>
<p>Besides, if you're a journalist or an editor please do consider joining us. You're more than welcome to make the CNM live-blog another source in covering the COP-19, and we would also be happy if you choose to contribute from your own country.</p>
