<h3>This Holiday Season, Give The Gift Of Charity, And Receive Art In Return!<br/>
</h3> <p>Let's start a holiday tradition! Magic, the Gathering is an awesome, fun, social, and educational card game. Any of us can spin elaborate tales of awesome Friday nights huddled around a kitchen table with friends, winning that Friday night Magic, or that subtly sweet toxic fume of a freshly cracked pack of cards. We owe a lot to Magic, and they receive our money for it..... lots of money. Wow, Magic has become expensive!</p>
<p></p>

<br/>It's become so expensive, that a lot of people can't afford it. Heck, a lot of people can't afford FOOD this holiday season. Therefore, we at Art Traders Unlimited suggest we start a holiday tradition; lets use the creative community to bring a little holiday cheer to the unfortunate!<br/><br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1036030/files/20141121123910-WhoIsATU.gif?1416602350"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/> <ul> <li>Art Trader's Unlimited is an art brokering company. One of our specialties is brokering commissions between artists who specialize in altering Magic, the Gathering cards, and potential clients.<br/>
</li> <li>We believe artists who graffiti, alter, or paint on top of Magic, the Gathering cards use these cards as a canvas. Therefore, their new works fall under the ""Fair Use"" clause of copyright law.<br/>
</li> <li>We DO NOT support duplicating copyrighted material! This takes away from the value of the original product, supports criminal activity, and makes life more difficult for the creative community.</li>

<br/>Absolutely! Artists have been modifying Magic the Gathering cards ever since they've been printed. There's a booming secondary art community featuring thousands of hand crafted works. To create these works, an artist will do the following:<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The artist will begin by purchasing the card from a vendor. Most of the time, these are purchased using online storefronts such as ChannelFireball, Starcity Games, Tcgplayer, etc.<br/>
</li>
<li>Once received, the artist will scan the card, and create a photoshop design of the new artwork they want placed on the card.<br/>
</li>
<li>When finished, the artist will either print a foil laminate, or a template which the artist can then paint on the card.</li>
<li>Finally, artists will generally spray a layer of satin spray paint to protect the new work.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>

<br/>For this holiday season's alters, we've commissioned an artist to create Holographic Overlay alters. These create the most playable, professional, and <b>*CONSISTENT*</b> looking  prints. Printed on the same material as a holographic trading card:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>The holographic foil material is between 25-50 microns thick. The new work has the exact same characteristics as a traditional foil Magic, the Gathering card.<br/>
</li>
<li>Between the added art, and the original card face, there is a subtle ""lip"". This is left in for counterfeit detection, (a counterfeit won't have a lip between the added art, and the original card face). As long as the card is played in a sleeve, it will have an unmarked surface.</li>
<li>The added art is laminated by hand to the card face using the same adhesives used on a traditional foil card. This allows it to have the exact same playing characteristics that will last for years to come!</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>When you live with epilepsy there are a lot of things you can't do because it isn't safe, but for me, the loss of independence has always been the kicker. That's why I want to do this walk alone. I want to experience independence on a grand scale, just me and God in the wilderness (with an emergency beacon to appease the people who care about me).</p>
<p>When I asked to use my study leave to go on a pilgrimage, I didn't think the 5 weeks would be approved. I'm not sure why I thought that, but I did. Next thing I knew, it was happening and the flights were booked. I take off on the 22nd April and return on the 26th May 2019.</p>
<p>It turns out that going on a pilgrimage is expensive, and I did not get the funding I had hoped for. Add to that the cost of medical insurance, the emergency beacon I need to carry and the terrible Canadian Dollar to Euro exchange rate...well lets just say my estimation of the costs were way off.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Someone told me recently that it would be good to have a cottage industry when they retire and I thought, ""I already have one,"" I am an artist!</p>
<p>Creativity, art and carving are meditative for me and so I am flogging my wares to raise money. I hope you will support me. You will receive the reward you choose, updates from the trail and an invite to the show of works that I will complete during and on my return later this year. This show will be streamed via my Facebook page for those of you who can't be there in person.</p>
<p>What are the costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been advised that I need to allow $50 a day for food and accommodation in hostels along the way: $1,650</li>
<li>I will be using the train from Paris to Le Puy, Cahors to St. Jean-Pierre du Pont and at the end from Santiago to Madrid airport</li>
<li>My insurance as someone with a existing medical condition is $380</li>
<li>The emergency beacon I will be carrying is $600 for the duration of the trip</li>
<li>Supplies, equipment, communications $500 </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Whichever perk you choose when you support me, you will receive some of my art work. </li>
<li>Hand drawn, hand carved or hand weaved.</li>
<li>You can also choose discounted art pins (badges) and/or stationary bundles featuring a selection of my artworks</li>
<li>Want it all? Choose ""The Whole Kit &amp; Caboodle"" and get everything on offer.</li>
<li>Everyone gets updates from the trail, an invite to the show and of course a personalized thank you from me.</li>
<li><strong>Don't want the stuff? You can support me by hitting the pink ""BACK IT"" button and put in whatever amount you like.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign will be the first phase of a larger project that I am working on to write a book about active and creative prayer.</p>
<p>In addition as part of the art show I will be giving an artist talk about the pilgrimage, the things I noticed and how the journey influenced my work and prayer life. I will also be speaking about what it is like to live with epilepsy and how it has influenced my work to date.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not my first project, so it isn't money down the drain!</li>
<li>I am working with an organization that actively promotes artists living with disabilities and have given artist talks with them to speak about living and creating with epilepsy.</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary
When you live with epilepsy there are a lot of things you can't do because it isn't safe, but for me, the loss of independence has always been the kicker. That's why I want to do this walk alone. I want to experience independence on a grand scale, just me and God in the wilderness (with an emergency beacon to appease the people who care about me).
When I asked to use my study leave to go on a pilgrimage, I didn't think the 5 weeks would be approved. I'm not sure why I thought that, but I did. Next thing I knew, it was happening and the flights were booked. I take off on the 22nd April and return on the 26th May 2019.
It turns out that going on a pilgrimage is expensive, and I did not get the funding I had hoped for. Add to that the cost of medical insurance, the emergency beacon I need to carry and the terrible Canadian Dollar to Euro exchange rate...well lets just say my estimation of the costs were way off.

What I Need & What You Get
Someone told me recently that it would be good to have a cottage industry when they retire and I thought, ""I already have one,"" I am an artist!
Creativity, art and carving are meditative for me and so I am flogging my wares to raise money. I hope you will support me. You will receive the reward you choose, updates from the trail and an invite to the show of works that I will complete during and on my return later this year. This show will be streamed via my Facebook page for those of you who can't be there in person.
What are the costs:

I have been advised that I need to allow $50 a day for food and accommodation in hostels along the way: $1,650
I will be using the train from Paris to Le Puy, Cahors to St. Jean-Pierre du Pont and at the end from Santiago to Madrid airport
My insurance as someone with a existing medical condition is $380
The emergency beacon I will be carrying is $600 for the duration of the trip
Supplies, equipment, communications $500 


The Perks

Whichever perk you choose when you support me, you will receive some of my art work. 
Hand drawn, hand carved or hand weaved.
You can also choose discounted art pins (badges) and/or stationary bundles featuring a selection of my artworks
Want it all? Choose ""The Whole Kit & Caboodle"" and get everything on offer.
Everyone gets updates from the trail, an invite to the show and of course a personalized thank you from me.
Don't want the stuff? You can support me by hitting the pink ""BACK IT"" button and put in whatever amount you like.

The Impact
This campaign will be the first phase of a larger project that I am working on to write a book about active and creative prayer.
In addition as part of the art show I will be giving an artist talk about the pilgrimage, the things I noticed and how the journey influenced my work and prayer life. I will also be speaking about what it is like to live with epilepsy and how it has influenced my work to date.

This is not my first project, so it isn't money down the drain!
I am working with an organization that actively promotes artists living with disabilities and have given artist talks with them to speak about living and creating with epilepsy.


Risks & Challenges

Many people have questioned whether I should be walking the Camino, but I am determined. If I have a seizure while I am travelling I have good insurance coverage, an emergency beacon if I am in an isolated area, and I will be carrying a medical alert in English, French and Spanish so that people will know how to help me if need be.
My neurologist supports me and told me to go for it! Do it while I can!
If I don't meet my fundraising goal I will go anyway, the flights are booked! However, I am hopeful that this project will help offset the costs of my journey. 


Other Ways You Can Help

Thank you for taking a look. Please share with your friends on social media, forward it to anyone that might be interested, or join my mailing list to get an invite to the show. If you can't support this venture financially, help me make some noise about it.
If you're someone who prays, I ask you to pray for me while I prepare and go on this pilgrimage.

<h3>Transmigration</h3>
<p>After traveling for dusty miles, a seat on a sculpture in the desert is welcome...Better yet, if there's a performance for entertainment...We have both to offer you and we just need some help leaving the midwest behind and transporting this 11 foot x 11 foot by 15 foot wood sculpture from Chicago to Black Rock City.</p>
<p>My name is Jyl Bonaguro and I am a sculptor and playwright. I designed this sculpture based upon a wing in flight. After many months of small scale models, my team and I finally have completed the full scale sculpture in wood along with a test build at a Chicago park. LED lighting is in process and we are super excited about placing it on the playa.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531885040/mijso1ya4odxg6uytfas.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>Our team has funded the majority of the sculpture, but...</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $1,500 to cover:</p>
<p>Transport and RV fees to the playa. It's a big piece that needs to be packed up and driven almost 2,000 miles. $1,500 will help offset expenses for our RV and gas.</p>
<p>Here's what your donations mean to us. Everything counts. I have been working with BAAAHS Chicago and San Francisco to bring Transmigration to Burning Man 2018 for the past 6 months. As a professional sculptor, I have welcomed such a great group of people who have helped me every step of the way to make my dream a reality. There's nothing better than to go from a paper model at 12 inches to a full scale sculpture standing 11 feet tall. It's been awesome and a huge amount of work for me and my team of volunteers.</p>

<h3>Why it matters</h3>
</div><div>
<p>This sculpture is inspired by the myth of the Phoenix. According to the Greek historian Herodotus (b: 484 BC), the phoenix was a beautiful, mythical bird from Ethiopia with elaborate plumage. This gorgeous bird made a nest of cypress branches and then set itself on fire. After three days, the phoenix emerged from its own ashes – reborn and released from the sentence of death, able to live on forever and thus serves as a symbol of hope and renewal.</p>
<p>The form of Transmigration is loosely based upon this plumage, not only of wings in flight but on fire. In the apex of the triangle, the Burning Man symbol is referenced as a subtle salute to the origins for this sculpture. The word ""transmigration"" means to pass from one place to another in the physical sense or spiritual in the theory of reincarnation. After the sculpture has been displayed, it will be consigned to the flames and burned to the ground as a symbol of renewal.</p>

is exactly the dilemma I found myself in, as I was doing

<p>Changing my research topic would’ve been the easiest way out of the dilemma I faced. However, I see myself as belonging to a new
generation of proactive young Africans who are determined to foster the change
that they want to see on the African continent. So I decided to create a comprehensive

the inspiration for their colors and symbols, and the materials and techniques used.The idea is to cover as much ground as possible, ensuring that the
wealth of Kenya’s crafts is captured in images and words.</p>
<p>I believe that preservation
needn’t be a long and bureaucratic process, and that preservation and
creativity aren’t mutually exclusive.  In
fact, I see the best kind of preservation as being one that transforms culture
in its raw form into cultural symbols, products and images that remain present
in our everyday lives, as opposed to living in documents in dusty archives that
few have access to.</p><p></p><p></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Public Benefit:</b></p><p>When I decided to launch this project, I made a conscious choice to figure out how the photographs and the information collected throughout the project would be beneficial to other people.

<li>University students in fields such as Design, Anthropology and History at universities in Kenya and elsewhere</li>
<li>The National Museums of Kenya</li>
<li>The Kenya Tourism Board</li>
</ul><p>Our goal is to have a public exhibition of the Crafting Kenya photography at the National Museum of Kenya in Nairobi, or other Nairobi-based cultural institutions, at the end of 2014 or beginning of 2015. Crafting Kenya is also open to partnering with other cultural institutions around the world to exhibit the Crafting Kenya photographs, and put a much-needed spotlight on Kenyan crafts and the artisans who make the crafts.</p><b>What's in it for our generous contributors? </b><div>Please see the perks section for information on Crafting Kenya's attractive perks.<div>

<p><i>“Paint a picture of the future. Go there.”-Seth Godin</i></p>
<p>Around the globe, creative and cultural industries are increasingly recognized for their significant economic and social impact. According to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Endowment for the Arts, the arts and cultural production accounted for $504 billion, or 3.2% of the US GDP in 2011. A Deutsche Bank Research report indicated that Germany’s cultural and creative industries generated 60 billion euros from goods and services produced by the sector, in 2009. The sector also employed over 1 million people.</p>
<p>Africa’s traditional cultures, if preserved and leveraged strategically, could be a great source of valuable materials and inspiration to power economically vibrant creative and cultural industries.</p>
<p>As I say in the video, I belong to a generation of young Africans who are invested in redefining the future of the continent. I see this project as a small but important contribution towards this redefinition of Africa’s future.</p>

The Project:Culture remains one
of Africa’s greatest, yet untapped, assets. The accelerating pace of

Kenya, with a professional photographer, creatively documenting Kenya's diverse
traditional crafts. I’ll also look to collect the stories behind the crafts,
the inspiration for their colors and symbols, and the materials and techniques used.The idea is to cover as much ground as possible, ensuring that the
wealth of Kenya’s crafts is captured in images and words.
I believe that preservation
needn’t be a long and bureaucratic process, and that preservation and
creativity aren’t mutually exclusive.  In
fact, I see the best kind of preservation as being one that transforms culture
in its raw form into cultural symbols, products and images that remain present
in our everyday lives, as opposed to living in documents in dusty archives that
few have access to.Public Benefit:When I decided to launch this project, I made a conscious choice to figure out how the photographs and the information collected throughout the project would be beneficial to other people. As such, the final project delivery, a professionally designed, digital compilation of Kenya’s crafts, will be availed to:
University students in fields such as Design, Anthropology and History at universities in Kenya and elsewhere
The National Museums of Kenya
The Kenya Tourism Board
Our goal is to have a public exhibition of the Crafting Kenya photography at the National Museum of Kenya in Nairobi, or other Nairobi-based cultural institutions, at the end of 2014 or beginning of 2015. Crafting Kenya is also open to partnering with other cultural institutions around the world to exhibit the Crafting Kenya photographs, and put a much-needed spotlight on Kenyan crafts and the artisans who make the crafts.What's in it for our generous contributors? Please see the perks section for information on Crafting Kenya's attractive perks.
This is what a professionally designed Crafting Kenya book (print and digital) could look like:

Thinking Long-Term:
“Paint a picture of the future. Go there.”-Seth Godin
Around the globe, creative and cultural industries are increasingly recognized for their significant economic and social impact. According to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Endowment for the Arts, the arts and cultural production accounted for $504 billion, or 3.2% of the US GDP in 2011. A Deutsche Bank Research report indicated that Germany’s cultural and creative industries generated 60 billion euros from goods and services produced by the sector, in 2009. The sector also employed over 1 million people.
Africa’s traditional cultures, if preserved and leveraged strategically, could be a great source of valuable materials and inspiration to power economically vibrant creative and cultural industries.
As I say in the video, I belong to a generation of young Africans who are invested in redefining the future of the continent. I see this project as a small but important contribution towards this redefinition of Africa’s future.
The Photographer:


Meet Anthony Bourasseau, Crafting Kenya's photographer. Anthony is a very talented photographer with a global eye. His experience as a photographer spans over diverse cultures in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. He is currently in France exhibiting photography from his travels in Cuba.
The Crafting Kenya team is excited to work with someone with his level of talent and commitment. 

How funds will be spent: 
The money raised
during this campaign will be used to cover administrative expenses only. All Crafting Kenya team members are volunteering their time, at no cost. Here are examples of project costs that we expect to incur:





Car
Rental, Experienced Driver and Gas for 21-30 days: $4,000-$5,000 (Ground travel will account for the biggest project expense.)


Local
Flights: $500 (In some cases, the team will have to travel by air.)

International flight: $700 (This is to bring the photographer to Kenya)

Accommodation: $1,500 (To cover accommodation
costs for 3-4 people during the duration of the project)


Data Organization and Design costs: TBD (At the end of the project, design
professionals will be hired to compile all the information collected in a
user-friendly and attractive layout.)

E-book: If we surpass our funding goal, we'll definitely look into publishing an e-book.

<p>As a person who grew up with <strong>STAR WARS</strong> as a guiding light, I feel that this incredible piece of cinema contains all of the lessons we need to help the human species build a brighter future and a thriving, morally conscious civilization.</p>
<p>By assuming the perspective of <strong>DARTH VADER </strong>I<strong> </strong>feel that the human race can finally come to comprehend the nature of evil and the many ways it can grow unseen in the human heart.</p>
<p>This is lesson I hope to explore with my new series of epic paintings titled: <strong><em>SANDSTORM.</em></strong></p>

<p align=""left"">My name is Chris Woods. I am a professional artist living and working in Chilliwack, BC, Canada (about 90 minutes east of Vancouver). I was born in 1970 and I have lived in Chilliwack since 1979.</p>
<p>My paintings over the last twenty-four years have looked at the far-reaching effects of mass-produced culture on the individual. They have appeared twice on the cover of Adbusters Magazine and in eighteen solo exhibitions in Canada and the United States since 1988.</p>

<p>Recently, I was invited to exhibit my work at The Reach Gallery Museum in Abbotsford, BC. This show, set to run in the summer of 2013, represents the first time in my twenty-four years as a visual artist that I have been asked to mount a solo exhibition in a museum setting.</p>

<p>By reexamining the films that played a major role in the formative years of my generation I hope to examine what our childhood eyes may have missed.</p>

<p>Even though we see <strong>Darth Vader</strong> as a two-dimensional monster, his mask actually disguises a highly nuanced, and very <em>human</em> character. By flipping the narrative of <strong>Star Wars</strong> I intend to look beyond the hollywood cliché of depicting the battle of good vs. evil as a simple case of 'black vs. white'.</p>
<p><img alt=""Pupil and Master Oil Study"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/495428/pictures/full/20121017230751-Luke___Yoda_on_Dagobah.jpg?1350540479"" src="""" style="""" title=""Pupil and Master Oil Study""/></p>
<p>Darth Vader’s journey to the dark side serves as a meditation on the nature of evil in the modern age. It also serves as entry point into understanding the mysterious forces that can slowly erode and distort the better human qualities we all share as individuals. Vader’s life followed a tragic arc that has many parallels in history and the history of painting.</p>
<p>These themes will be tackled in <strong>SANDSTORM</strong> through fourteen epic-scale oil-paintings on canvas inspired by 19th century French Romantic painter Eugene Delacroix. Delacroix was obsessed with painting scenes from epics by Dante, Virgil and Shakespeare. I see the <strong>Star Wars Trilogy</strong> as the most popular myth of <em>our</em> time, just as Delacroix saw <em>The Divine Comedy</em>, <em>The Aeneid </em>and<em> Hamlet </em>as the popular myths of <em>his</em> time.</p>

<p>The paintings will be based on digital ‘screen captures’ taken from the original theatrical cuts of the <strong>Star Wars Trilogy</strong> and the ‘deleted scenes’ found on the ‘<strong>Star Wars</strong>: Complete Saga’, Blu-Ray Box-Set. The show’s title, <strong>SANDSTORM</strong>, is taken from the most famous of these deleted scenes. </p>
<p>These paintings will chronicle the darkest visions and nightmares that Darth Vader may have suffered in his private moments during the events of the original <strong>Star Wars Trilogy</strong>. Even though we are used to standing beside the heroic characters of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia as they fight for good, to Vader they were mysterious figures that represented the greatest threat to him and his future. To Vader <em>they</em> are the villains to be feared and destroyed.</p>
<p>In an effort to better express these themes I plan to adopt a looser, more restless style of painting. By utilizing a more agitated and expressive approach I hope to emulate the ceaseless, personal torment that Vader fought through every day.</p>
<p>By seeing the events of the <strong>Star Wars trilogy</strong> from Darth Vader’s perspective I feel that we can gain true insight into the circumstances that can blind any individual and twist them into an ‘agent of evil’. This is the primary role of this exciting new series.</p>
<p>By showing this project in a museum setting, I now have the potential to bring my work to an entirely new audience and perhaps gain the attention of the larger fine-art community.</p>
<p>A museum venue for a visual-artist has a tremendous impact on the minds of professional curators, art collectors and critics and it could signal a major advancement for my artistic ‘brand’.</p>
<p>Even without these possibilities the challenge of completing work for a museum exhibition is a large one that I must complete successfully. The invitation from The Reach Gallery Museum is an incredible honor and I must respond with every tool I have in order to create a body of work suitable for exhibition in their incredible cultural venue.</p>
<p>The materials and resources I require to complete the <strong>SANDSTORM</strong> project are modest but vital to the successful conclusion of this exhibition. Materials such as paint, canvas, stretcher bars, brushes, gesso, painting mediums and varnishes comprise approximately $3000 of my requested budget and constitute the very core of what I require in the studio.</p>
<p>I am also planning to spend approximately $2000 to upgrade some of the tools I use in my day-to-day work such as an artist’s digital projector, and a new digital SLR camera to use in the production and documentation of the paintings themselves. These items will streamline my workflow and turn days of work into hours. A new camera will also allow me to properly document The Reach Gallery Museum <strong>SANDSTORM</strong> installation, the opening ceremonies and any related events such as talks or lectures.</p>
<p>The pictures I work from while painting also require a large amount of printer-ink and photographic paper to bring them to life. Also needed are research materials such as books, dvd’s, and periodicals of all types. The amount needed to purchase these items for <strong>SANDSTORM</strong> is approximately $1000.</p>
<p>The remainder of the funds will go toward basic studio and household living expenses i.e. heat, lighting. Ten months of worry-free studio time are just as essential to producing these works, as are the oil-paint, canvas and wood that go into their construction.</p>
<p>Some of you may feel that your money may be poorly spent in supporting an artist unknown to you but please keep in mind that over the last twenty-four years I have completed and exhibited 18 solo shows comprising over 175 major oil-paintings, drawings and prints.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>(My name is Ginny Roberts, and I am a local artist and teacher in Central Alabama. I have had a shoe-string business-as in zero dollars to market or advertise-- for the last 3 years. I have not had the proper funding to grow my business and expand it so that it is more valuable to the community at large. This fundraiser will allow Ginn's Art to move to a larger location, to buy supplies, to reach more potential artists, to begin an after school high school art program, and community center art workshops for all ages. Ginn's Art provides paint parties, workshops, and classes, as well as volunteers her time working on community art projects- such as theatrical sets, and props for the local community theatre.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div>
<p>This fundraiser would impact the community in which we live by providing children and adults with the opportunity to express themselves through art. It would provide a positive entertainment venue for children, teens, parents etc. It will also add to the educational experiences of our community as well as promote art and culture within our community. Additionally, it will add a viable business that could potentially expand throughout the state and possibly the country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<div>
<p>In order to make this happen we need $16,000.</p>
<p>$3000.00 to lease an area for 6 months,</p>
<p>$2500 to purchase additional tables, chairs, sink, other fixtures, office equipment.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
(My name is Ginny Roberts, and I am a local artist and teacher in Central Alabama. I have had a shoe-string business-as in zero dollars to market or advertise-- for the last 3 years. I have not had the proper funding to grow my business and expand it so that it is more valuable to the community at large. This fundraiser will allow Ginn's Art to move to a larger location, to buy supplies, to reach more potential artists, to begin an after school high school art program, and community center art workshops for all ages. Ginn's Art provides paint parties, workshops, and classes, as well as volunteers her time working on community art projects- such as theatrical sets, and props for the local community theatre.
 
The Impact

This fundraiser would impact the community in which we live by providing children and adults with the opportunity to express themselves through art. It would provide a positive entertainment venue for children, teens, parents etc. It will also add to the educational experiences of our community as well as promote art and culture within our community. Additionally, it will add a viable business that could potentially expand throughout the state and possibly the country.
 
 What We Need & What You Get
 

In order to make this happen we need $16,000.
$3000.00 to lease an area for 6 months,
$2500 to purchase additional tables, chairs, sink, other fixtures, office equipment.
$3000.00 employee other artists for 6 months,
$1000 building and remodeling supplies and labor,
$3500 for art supplies,(paint, brushes, easels, canvas, etc.),
$3,000 for marketing and advertising. If we reach our goal and beyond we will be able to do great things. If we don't reach our goal we will work with what we have and try again. Some funding will come from what little the business has brought in to this point. Larger space, more supplies, more advertising, the business will explode into something awesome.

Impact of Murals in Los Angeles


 Los Angeles was known as one of
the great mural capitals of the world at one time, boasting the production of thousands of
murals by world renowned artists and members of Los Angeles diverse
communities.  Today, Los Angeles visual culture is under serious threat as these massive monuments that once adorned
the streets and freeways of this city with vibrant color and our cultural
histories are now deteriorating under the weight of tagging, aggressive weather
damage, and city-wide neglect. Running parallel to the ongoing physical
degradation of these visual legacies are dramatic cuts in spending on the arts
nationwide as well as the massive closure of community based cultural programs.
In the face of this collective hardship, we are confronted with an ever increasing
need for public visual arts to provide a source of creativity and inspiration
to the people of Los Angeles. 

Benefits of Public Art Murals
- Help communities prosper and creates a sense of respect and civic pride.
- Business magnets.
- Attract tourism revenue.
- Students engaged in the arts perform better academically.



What is the money being used for?
We are trying to raise $6,000 to complete the restoration of the ""Jim Morphesis Monument"" Olympic Freeway Mural. All proceeds cover the expenses associated with the completion of the restoration process including equipment and supplies. As well the original muralist Kent Twitchell will play an active role donating his time in restoration and touch ups as needed.

Your contribution of any amount makes a critical impact in bringing this iconic mural back to it's original glory.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>To quote Don Draper, ""Well, as I said before, I'm from the Midwest.

<p>That is why Flyover Press was born.  To help show our pride in being from the states others would rather just flyover.  To show them what they are missing.  To convince them they may just want to take in the heartland from the ground and not just the air.  To project our identity to the rest of the country.  To be the voice that we are often too humble to use.</p>

A huge thank you to everyone who contributed and helped spread the word. We hit our goal, the t-shirts are in and the posters are arriving soon. We also have our web site up so head over to shopflyoverpress.com today.
 
Update

If the campaign hits $2500, the Crossroads of America print will be released at the launch.  Inspired by Indiana's nickname resulting from the large amount of interstates crisscrossing the state, the poster depicts the state on a modified interstate sign.
Short Summary
To quote Don Draper, ""Well, as I said before, I'm from the Midwest. We were taught that it's not polite to talk about yourself.""  That's how we were taught to grow up in the Midwest, to be humble and not to brag.  But there's a problem in that.  It means we are often overlooked by the rest of the country.  They don't talk about us and we are too humble to talk about us and thus we are ignored.  Maybe it's time we started talking about ourselves.
That is why Flyover Press was born.  To help show our pride in being from the states others would rather just flyover.  To show them what they are missing.  To convince them they may just want to take in the heartland from the ground and not just the air.  To project our identity to the rest of the country.  To be the voice that we are often too humble to use.
Flyover Press creates letterpress posters inspired by the states, the regions, the culture, the heritage and the people of the Midwest.  Each 13"" x 20"" poster will be pressed in limited runs using the traditional method onto 110lb. letterpress paper.  The pressing itself is done in Chicago using handset type and linoleum cuts and good old-fashioned Midwestern hard work.  Midwestern letterpress posters made in the Midwest by Midwesterners.

Moviehouse's The Circle Bridge is a new site-specific video performance that combines live choreography and large-scale animation of Nathan Punwar to tell a story of interconnectivity, travel and history. 
Audience members follow their own distinct narrative as they walk the span of the 2810 foot *Pulaski Bridge that connects Greenpoint, Brooklyn with Long Island City, Queens across the Newtown Creek. 
Along their walk, they encounter animations/projections by Nathan Punwar and two unique dance performances by Blue Muse Dance that each tell a distinct part of the tale. Each element is integrally designed to give each viewer a unique all-encompassing visual, audio and physical experience.
The Circle Bridge is structured by six overlapping stories that are grounded in the history of the bridge, the neighborhoods that surround it and the communities that live and work there. The audience meets six distinct characters and they traverse time and space in interconnected loops. Projected photographs morph into large animations on warehouses and come to life as dancers on the bridge itself. 


Outreach program:                                                                                                    We are in the process of writing a curriculum to be taught to school children in the area to create their own Circle Bridge.


*The Pulaski Bridge in New York City connects Long Island City in Queens to Greenpoint in Brooklyn over Newtown Creek. It was named after Polish military commander and American Revolutionary War fighter Kazimierz Pułaski (Casimir Pulaski) because of the large Polish-American population in Greenpoint.  It connects 11th Street in Queens to McGuinness Boulevard (formerly Oakland Street) in Brooklyn.
The Pulaski Bridge opened to traffic on September 10, 1954. It served as a replacement for the nearby Vernon Avenue Bridge, which had linked Vernon Avenue in Long Island City with Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint.
Designed by Frederick Zurmuhlen, the Pulaski Bridge is a bascule bridge, a type of drawbridge. It carries six lanes of traffic and a pedestrian sidewalk over the water, Long Island Rail Road tracks, and the entrance to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. The pedestrian sidewalk is on the west or downstream side of the bridge, which has good views of the industrial areas surrounding Newtown Creek, the skyline of Manhattan, and of a number of other bridges, including the Williamsburg Bridge, the Queensboro Bridge, and the Kosciuszko Bridge. The bridge was reconstructed between 1991 and 1994.

<h2><strong>About the Artist:</strong></h2>
<p>￼ Michele is a self-taught Artist from Iowa. As a child, she would sit in her room while trying to draw pictures or objects she saw to perfection. Sometimes, she'd even sit in the kitchen and create sculptures out of aluminum foil while her Mother cooked, or, she'd create designs or sculptures out of garbage and give them as gifts to her friends and teachers, (lucky them- HA!). For her, it was like playing in the park, playing sports, etc... she assumed it was something all kids did. In grade school, whenever they had an art project to do, Michele usually got asked to make an extra one for the kids that weren't there- she never thought anything of it. It wasn't until high school that she realized it was an actual talent.</p>
<p> Years later, Michele purchased an abundant amount of miscellaneous art supplies and had a studio where she tried a little bit of everything until she found her niche. She even took a couple of classes at Drake University to see if there was anything she might learn that she hadn't taught herself. Michele soon discovered that abstracts and color were her strongest attributes. She has been selling art privately for over 15 years and started selling online in 2005 through various websites.</p>
<p> Michele uses Acrylic paint for most of her paintings and prefers to use pastels, colored pencil, chalk, charcoal or watercolor paint for more detailed work. Her art is a reflection of her personality. It’s spontaneous, colorful, energetic, mysterious and compassionate. She's always wanting &amp; willing to try new things in life to prevent boredom while also capturing precious moments on film and embracing them on canvas, wood or paper. This is why you’ll usually see a variety in her work along with being able to captivate a diverse type of audience. Color is her strongest attribute along with simplistic, contemporary or modern type art. You’ll find most of Michele's abstracts quite versatile. They can either be hung vertically or horizontally. Whenever she starts painting or drawing an idea that she has, the finished product usually ends up being something entirely different creating a pleasant surprise in the end.</p>
<p><strong>A B S T R A C T S:</strong></p>
<p><strong>""Breaking Down The Wall""</strong></p>
<p>“My abstracts portray me the best. They’re a therapeutic way for me to release a lifetime of bottled up energy and emotions that have been trapped inside. I’m able to freely express myself without the fear of being judged or criticized while showing my adventurous and ambitious side at the same time. My abstracts also reflect the abnormally warped speeds my mind travels at forcing me to try and keep up with the thought process in my head. Therefore, once I start painting, I work at a very fast pace and rarely stop until it’s finished.”</p>
<p><strong>C O L L A G E S:</strong></p>
<p><strong>""The Rebel In Me""</strong></p>
<p>“This series shows my rebellious side! I spend countless hours creating numerous, amazing paintings on canvas, only to ruin them by courageously cutting them up and strategically placing them creating one giant masterpiece. This also creates a fascinating display of multiple, individual paintings, that will grab your attention and keep you from looking away. Sometimes you’ll see different materials incorporated into my work.”</p>
<p><strong>S I L O U E T T E S:</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Open Up Your Inner Passion”</strong></p>
<p>Quite simply, these display my more sensitive, caring &amp; compassionate side. I created these in a way so when you look at them, they’ll lure in your eyes, and, relax your mind allowing you to embrace the beautiful moment tastefully.</p>

The life of an artist can be immensely rewarding as well as very challenging. Currently my situation is exceedingly challenging!
So I've set up this campaign and I'm offering rare prints, jewelry, sculpture castings, original drawings and sketches, as well as a few surprises.

<h3>the short of it:</h3>
<p> welcome to the crowdfunding campaign for beeluxe’s trek-inspired pride pin! every trekkie deserves to be included in trek merch, but that doesn’t mean they always are. my goal is to make things for the community, by the community, starting with this pride pin.</p>
<h3>what we need to raise and why:</h3>
<p>the up front cost of the enamel pins is $200USD/$250CAD (indiegogo doesn't allow goals under $500, but our goal is $250). this includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>blank creation and mold casting of the design</li>
<li>production of an initial batch zinc-alloy, gold plated pins with two posts each</li>
<li>rubber pin backs</li>
<li>shipping to canada for inspection and packaging</li>
</ul>
<h3>what you’ll get:</h3>
<p>i plan to price each pin at $15CAD/$12USD on my site. by becoming an initial backer, you’ll get (tier perks vary):</p>
<ul>
<li>a discounted pin rate of $10USD/pin</li>
<li>a matching 2 inch trek pride sticker with metallic gold foil finish</li>
<li>a matching 2 inch trek pride magnet</li>
</ul>
<h3>challenges:</h3>
<p>the biggest challenge is the time table. pins take anywhere from 4-6 weeks to make and ship. i do anticipate them arriving sooner, as my manufacturer is very quick with their turnaround. however, i would be remiss if i didn’t lay out that time frame just in case. we are funding this in the middle of a panini.</p>
<p>this project will go forward with whatever funding we get. i don’t want to promise something and not deliver. this campaign is to keep me from going into debt to make this happen!</p>

<h2>Our Mission:</h2>
<h3>Essubi Arts' mission is to teach multi-disciplinary art lessons that foster imagination, hope and healing to Ugandan children living with orphan hearts. <em>Essubi</em> means <em>Hope</em>.</h3>
<p>Essubi Arts will be returning, for the third time, to work with New Hope Uganda, a children’s center whose mission is to ‘bring the Fatherhood of God to the Fatherless’, from June 23 through July 10<sup>th</sup>, 2013. Our vision is to provide continued art creation opportunities, in a variety of mediums to the children living at New Hope Uganda who have very limited access and resources in these areas. It is our desire is to equip children with orphan hearts to explore the world creatively so they may open the windows of imagination, curiosity, and self-expression and find new ways to connect with their Creator.</p>
<h2>What We Do:</h2>

</div></div>","Our Mission:
Essubi Arts' mission is to teach multi-disciplinary art lessons that foster imagination, hope and healing to Ugandan children living with orphan hearts. Essubi means Hope.
Essubi Arts will be returning, for the third time, to work with New Hope Uganda, a children’s center whose mission is to ‘bring the Fatherhood of God to the Fatherless’, from June 23 through July 10th, 2013. Our vision is to provide continued art creation opportunities, in a variety of mediums to the children living at New Hope Uganda who have very limited access and resources in these areas. It is our desire is to equip children with orphan hearts to explore the world creatively so they may open the windows of imagination, curiosity, and self-expression and find new ways to connect with their Creator.
What We Do:
We help children explore, craft, and share their stories through art in a variety of mediums. We will be working closely with the staff of New Hope Uganda, to assist in the development of ‘ArtCare’. The idea of ‘ArtCare’ is to use art as a tool to reveal and heal what’s in the heart. An art project can be a safe place where a child could express something that happened in their past, or something that is currently going on in their heart, without necessarily having to use words.

<p>I'm raising funds to continue my graduate studies in Expressive Arts Therapy and Conflict Transformation. My university offers a matching scholarship, where they match the amount raised from family and friends who support this degree.</p>
<h3>What is Expressive Arts?</h3>
<p>This degree is an MA in Expressive Arts Therapy and Conflict Transformation &amp; Peace Building. Essentially, I am studying how five art disciplines (visual art, music, dance/movement, poetry/creative writing, and theatre) can all be used together in various situations and populations to stimulate positive changes. Expressive Arts therapists work in hospitals with the terminally ill, in nursing homes, schools, and in mental health fields. We also work with victims of domestic violence, the incarcerated, the homeless, war veterens, and with refugees.  Your donations can impact a wide range of populations with specific needs, plus you will be supporting the arts in health and society. </p>
<h3>Projects underway:</h3>
<p>For my internships, I am currently implementing an Expressive Arts program in San Diego Youth Services' CAT program where I facilitate groups of ""at-risk youth."" The program is an after school program with the goal of buiding social skills, skills in healthy self-expression, and building a sense of community through the arts and play. I'm implementing another Expressive Arts program at the San Diego Girls Rehabilitation Facility where I work individually with adolecent girls who've experienced traumatic situations such as human trafficking and domestic abuse. The sessions use a solution-focused approach with the goal of building self-esteem, empowerment, and healthy self-expression.</p>
<h3>Funding goal:</h3>
<p>My goal is $2000. The amount raised, regardless of reaching the goal or not,  will go to my university and will be applied to this summer school's tuition wherein the university will match it. </p>
<p>If contributing even the smallest amount carries too much of a burden, please share this page via Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media or website to encourage support from others who may be interested in supporting.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Benton Main Street organization welcomes the Children’s Art Center to Benton and encourages all who hear about this permanent and valuable addition to our community to “Cover Our Kids”!</p>
<p>“We Are Marshall County and We Cover Our Kids” is a campaign designed to raise funds for a part of the original Children’s Art Center in downtown Benton that was cut from the budget due to lack of funding.  The brick canopy is already designed and in the building plans and the $25,000 raised will complete that structure to provide shelter from adverse weather while dropping off our kids.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Children’s Art Center is currently under construction and is the culmination of ten years of planning, fundraising and outreach.  The Center has obtained grants, gifts, loans and in-kind contributions but still is short of its goal in its capital campaign.  Accordingly, it had to cut the canopy from the construction budget.  Happily the rest of the project is well underway and should be completed in early fall 2013.</p>
<p>For many years, the Marshall County Arts Commission has served the young people of Marshall County in various locations such as schools, city and county government buildings and private facilities.  We are now so close to realizing the dream of a public community space dedicated to all who appreciate the value of arts education and experience.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Now to the Fun Part</h3>
<p>There are many faces of Marshall County that we want to showcase as our own public art project, to visibly show the community commitment to the Arts Center.</p>
<p>People across the county will be photographed over the next few weeks and their images will be displayed everywhere throughout the county.Then at end end of our project we will host a GRAND REVEAL where you will be an honored guest! The REVEAL is scheduled for June 15, 2013 - more details to follow!  There are a number of ways that contributors can participate even if they don’t want their picture taken and displayed.  As a matter of fact, even if you can’t contribute you can help us get the word out!</p>
<p>We know that this will inspire lots of folks to think how they may promote family members, friends, pets etc. as worthy of praise for their accomplishments and pride for Marshall County and its dedication to the arts.</p>
<p>There are different levels of participation, each of which is awarded a <strong>Perk</strong>!  As you can see from our <strong>Perks</strong> column, there are many fun ways to contribute and get some goodies.</p>
<p>Check out where you feel most motivated and tell your family, friends and neighbors about this unique way to show our pride and love for our kids.</p>
<p>Any funds raised in excess of our goal or under our goal will be used as the Marshall County Arts Commission may direct for the construction and operation of the Children’s Art Center so no money will go unused or unappreciated.</p>

attending all local schools beginning with Longfellow Elementary, Elliot

After high school I attended
Pasadena City College where I majored in architecture and art.     I built many scale models of various
buildings such as the Tramway in Palm Springs, the Swedish Covenant Hospital
in Chicago Illinois and the Emanuel Medical Center in Turlock California and
this Star Trek Enterprise (above).In 1989 I started drawing with pen and ink, and slowly began to add color (below). 




Most drawings are 22” x 28” but some are also 27""x 40""(above).

As
I drew more I did peoples homes (above) and sold a few.  I also drew from
imagination as seen below.  Notice the detailed in these enlarged images below.





 Wall Art at Color.

As a regular customer at the Altadena Golf Course in the Pasadena area, I’ve met a friend who wanted to know if I could draw color paintings on walls inside his home.I accepted his job request of doing Spanish tiles on this stair well.  
The entire project took about 3 ½ weeks. As in the stair case scene, it was  all done from imagination.  The entire drawing was outlined in pencil and then in marking tape. 







The second project was a
European Corner table chair and shelf above.  This idea was given to me be homeowner.  He wanted it very large and life size,
it ended up to be over eight feet wide and four feet tall.  The masking
tape was used to outline every detail and area.  
The masking process was
repeated at least 100 times to complete the many layers of color and detail. 
When completed the table and chair will appear to be flat while drawn in a
corner of the room. Every detail was done in three dimensions. 






WHAT I NEED
FROM YOU.
I am trying to raise $37,500.00 in which:

- $17,500 will be used to create a line
of Pen & Ink art books.
- $12,500 will be used for Pen & Ink Puzzles,
Calendars, Mugs, T-shirts etc.
- $7,500 marketing and supplies 

I have a list of gifts that you will receive upon your
contribution.
I understand that sometime it’s not possible to make a
contribution.  Please feel free to contribute by emailing your friends about my campaign. 
This to is very beneficial in helping me reach my goals.

DONATION USAGE

As I receive donations I plan to market my work nation wide including, books, puzzles, glassware, wallpaper,  pottery, floor tiles etc.  I want to create children’s coloring books and expand to teaching aides using tee shirts to show math symbols and alphabetical letters as a great learning tool.
These donations will enable me to reach many more eager merchants & buyers.

<h3>2.  Diet</h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Burning Man's environment is a vast social sculpture, a place that encompasses the collective spirit as well as elements of Buddhist teachings, both impermanence and human ritual. In this desert landscape sculpture can speak the language of the sublime.</p>
<p>This is a mother/son collaboration- the sound designer on this project is Justin Harmon Calder who has integrated his art collective /music label, Budo Kiba, into the team and several of the members will be traveling to Burning Man to record the playing of the sculptures in the Black Rock Desert. </p>
<p>Your contribution to 'Totem Orchestra will make our vision a reality. Together, we are building a community of artisans, providing an amazing arena for new forms of expression with sound and sculpture. The funds raised will help cover the cost of materials, lighting, fabrication of the three sound sculptures  and the video documentation of the work.   </p>
<p>Joan Harmon is offering a selection of her artworks - original drawings, sculptures and prints as perks for your donations.</p>

Burning Man's environment is a vast social sculpture, a place that encompasses the collective spirit as well as elements of Buddhist teachings, both impermanence and human ritual. In this desert landscape sculpture can speak the language of the sublime.
This is a mother/son collaboration- the sound designer on this project is Justin Harmon Calder who has integrated his art collective /music label, Budo Kiba, into the team and several of the members will be traveling to Burning Man to record the playing of the sculptures in the Black Rock Desert. 
Your contribution to 'Totem Orchestra will make our vision a reality. Together, we are building a community of artisans, providing an amazing arena for new forms of expression with sound and sculpture. The funds raised will help cover the cost of materials, lighting, fabrication of the three sound sculptures  and the video documentation of the work.   
Joan Harmon is offering a selection of her artworks - original drawings, sculptures and prints as perks for your donations.
Please see a the perks below:

<h3>What is the show about?</h3>
<p>With this art installation I want to shine the light on the dark side of American Football. One part of this is 'CTE' (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy), a degenerative brain disease, found in athletes, military veterans, and others with a history of repetitive brain trauma. In the last 15 years, American Football players in particular have been known to have this disease, that can only be diagnosed after death by brain tissue analysis.</p>
<p>The main reason for this is of course the violent character of the sport itself. They use their head as a weapon, just like a ram uses it to fight or a woodpecker uses it to cut a hole in a tree. The only thing is, humans are physiologically not made for this. The countless concussions are a clear indicator of this.</p>
<p>Constant (peer) pressure and the general attitude that team doctors have to keep the players up-and-running (at all costs) only increases the risk of brain injury. </p>
<p>Possible symptoms of CTE include: memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, paranoia, impulse control problems, aggression, depression (suicide), and eventually progressive dementia.</p>
<p>To me, the interesting thing about this situation is not the way the NFL is dealing with it. By paying hundreds of former players millions of dollars to prevent further lawsuits. I think it's more interesting to see how the American society is treating their (former) heroes.</p>
<p>It's as if as long the players can play (and entertain the crowd) they are Gods. But once these players need the society or their community for help (psychological or physical) they turn their backs to them.</p>
<p>With this work I wanted to visualize both the good side of American football. The glamour, the fame, team spirit. But also the dark side that society would rather ignore: the many injuries, the brain damage, the domestic violence , the suicides...</p>
<p>That's why one side of the helmet is kept clean and shiny, while the other side is destroyed.</p>
<p>I specifically asked to do the show around this topic because it's a topic in the US.</p>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>Consider the Art World as a ladder. Two and half years ago I started at the bottom of it. One year later I had my paintings in cities like Los Angeles, Paris, Brussels, New York and Mexico City. Sounds good, right? I agree! But as an ambitious artist I want more. The last thing I want is to be a one-trick-pony. That's why I took the risk to invest in other projects as well. Projects that may not be as accessible or appreciated as the letter paintings, but focus more on what I want to express as an artist. That's why this opportunity is so interesting. It gives me the chance to show people the artistic direction that I want to go in. And it's not just anywhere! It's in New York: one of thé most important art cities in the World. For that reason alone, I should already go. There's also the opportunity to meet local collectors and other artists.</p>
<p>On top, I will be able to add a New York (solo)show to my portfolio. Which would increase my chances in the future to work with other galleries. </p>
<h3>How much do I need?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Besides my own money that I invest, I need $6.000 to cover the rest of the costs of this project. </p>

<p><b>What is Blue One, Pink One?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Blue one, Pink One is a minimalistic approach introducing children to fashion, creativity, and self discovery with the intention of igniting wee inspiration.</p>
<p>Through this quarterly publication, we hope to create an outlet for families to bond together and inspire one another.  Our primary goal is to ensure that it is comprehensible to even the smallest and freshest of readers but also beloved by their parents.  As such, our publication is dedicated FIRSTLY, however not exclusively, to children.  It is meant to be shared by families, allowing them to read together and be together.</p>
<p>We hope to encourage and facilitate a growing passion in our little ones for reading. We want them to get the issue in their chubby little hands and coo and point and flip from page to page and be inspired to write a piece on superheroes and tell you a story about hippos and take photos of the world around them and go to their closets and pick out something original and speak up in their classes and paint a masterpiece and remember to tell their daddy when he looks handsome or their mother looks lovely. We want the horizon of books before them at the library to suddenly seem surmountable and for reading to be one of your family's favorite past time, if it isn't already.</p>
<p>Secondly, we want to teach our children that it's more than OK to be exactly themselves; that they have nothing to apologize for and no one to answer to for simply being who they are. We want them to feel free to pursue what inspires their little minds and souls. We  want them to see other children and other families around the globe and relate to their feelings and tastes and lifestyles. Our children sometimes have such a small pool to swim in - so few peers to connect with - that it can be very difficult to feel understood and accepted. </p>
<p>As adults, we also search for ways to connect, to feel understood and accepted, to be inspir<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ed by someone like-minded through blogs, magazines, and websites.  This need is shared by our children.</span></p>
<p>Lastly, we believe our children have so much to teach <b>US</b>. There is so much we forget to indulge, nurture, and engage within them. They are so much more INFINITELY creative than we. They are born without inhibition or worry that they are coloring outside the lines. They are sincerely bold. We hope this publication gives rise to many families communicating on a deeper, more elemental, and more genuine level. </p>
<p>We believe this publication will help us to remember, as parents, to slow down, unplug, and put aside everything else to wile away the hours every now and again with the greatest friends and teachers we will ever know.</p>

<p>The Finest: A G.I. Joe Costume Club
is thrilled to partner with the United Service Organizations (USO) for the
second annual Girls of the Finest charity calendar!</p>
<p>Last year’s campaign was a huge
success, and it demonstrated to the world just how powerful the G.I. Joe fan
community is when it comes to raising money for veteran and
military-related organizations. Following last year’s success, we are
absolutely determined to surpass that success this year! </p>
<p>So here's the deal: </p>
<p>As you know by now, the Girls of the
Finest charity calendar is no ordinary pin-up calendar. All your favorite
female characters (plus a few twists) will be portrayed here - 12 months of
our amazing female costumers photographed <b>exclusively</b> for this
calendar! </p>
<p>As passionate as we are about G.I.
Joe, we also know a good cause when we see one. The Finest is honored for the
opportunity to partner with the USO, a nonprofit organization that has
supported America’s troops and their families since 1941. One hundred percent
of the net proceeds earned from this campaign will go to the USO. </p>
<p>This year’s cause is near and dear
to our hearts. A significant portion of Finest members are active duty troops
and veterans. Many of our own members and their families have directly
benefited from the USO over the years, so being able to partner with this
historic organization and give something back is an amazing opportunity!</p>
<p>What better way to come together as
a fan community and support the Real American Heroes of the U.S. military and
their families! </p>
<p><b>We Need YOU!</b></p>
<p>As excited as we are about this
project, we can't do it without <b>YOU</b>. Only through your

us to:</p>
<p>• Compile all the calendar
photography</p>
<p>• Design and produce the calendar
and all associated perks</p>
<p>• Pay for printing and shipping
costs of the calendar and perks</p>
<p>Also, we will be creating <b>EXCLUSIVE</b> content
for this campaign that will only be available to those who donate here,
including <b>Girls of The Finest</b> trading cards, postcards,
patches, t-shirts and perhaps a few surprises!!! Just like last year, these
will only be produced in limited quantities and once they're gone, that's it!</p>
<p>Everyone who donates $5 or more will

A different approach to the traditional 'pay at the door' transaction, this campaign serves as a way to fund the project beyond proper ticket sales. Although you're welcome to donate at the door or even after the show if that's more convenient.

We need your help relocating the gallery to a new and improved central location! Here's why:FJORD operates as an artist-run space because of the freedom it affords us. Functioning as a non-commercial entity gives us the flexibility and independence to display exciting, challenging, and venturous work free of commercial pressures and limitations. While membership fees and various fundraising strategies will contribute to maintaining our new gallery space, we need your help to make the move to a more accessible building and to restructure our organization to become sustainable for the future of FJORD. The funds raised from this campaign will be used to secure the new space located in the Crane Arts Building on N. American Street in Philadelphia, PA. We will also be allocating portions of the funds raised to hire a grant writer, provide more support for exhibiting artists, and facilitate more extensive programming than what was previously possible.                                                   February 2014, FJORD hosted Rebekah Callaghan, Monica Amor and Rubens Ghenov to discuss the QUALIA show.  

While 2419 Frankford Ave. will certainly be missed, we couldn't be more excited about the opportunities to grow FJORD. Here's what we're looking forward to with our re-launch:


Central location providing easier access to the gallery 
More square feet for artwork, performances, and events
Six-week long exhibitions instead of four
Potential to build partnerships within Crane Arts and beyond
Greater exposure for the artists who exhibit at FJORD


Expanded gallery hours
Ability to host and participate in auxiliary events




           




Our mission from the beginning has been to:



provide an exhibition space for local and international artists at all points in their career.
organize multidisciplinary exhibitions, artist-curated projects, film screenings, and community events
foster alternative, experimental, and marginalized practices and discourses within the artist-run model

During the four years that Fjord has been open, we have been lucky enough to work with over 300 artists, both national and international, on over 30 exhibitions. As artist members we see the curatorial projects that take place both inside and outside the walls of FJORD as extensions of our studio practices and the practices of the artist-curators whom we support.

Our staff was often lauded for our close-knitted-ness, our tenacity, and our dedication. The behind-the-scenes story only reinforces this perception.</p>
<p>Days seemed like weeks and if someone had a desk next to yours then there was a 90% chance that they would become your best friend before the first coffee break was over. And there were moments that illustrated all of this. I began capturing these - just for posterity's sake in my sketchbook. As the moments added up and interest in how this collection of young kids with (largely) no prior experience pulled off an amazing electoral victory began building, I began to see these moments coalescing to tell a greater story.</p>
<div>
<p>A collection of 600 drawings that illustrate what it was really like.</p>
<p>The heartache, the unbelievable stress, and the moments when despite everything you laugh for half an hour because someone screwed up and a sex hotline number was printed on a state-wide absentee mailer. This is what campaign life is about: the moments.</p>
<p>The specifics are my own, yet my story is everyone's story on this campaign. The incredibly inspiring call to service that prompted me to hop a bus to New Hampshire, driving from Ohio to Mississippi with just a backpack to my name, and working with the smartest people I'll ever know.</p>
<p>After the 2008 campaign I intended to return to my original day job: working as an artist. Yet, as anyone involved in electoral campaigns can tell you, the industry tends to pull you right back in. Soon enough, I found myself working for OFA again, this time in Florida.</p>
<p>I stayed on through the 2012 cycle, working as a Regional Field Director in the biggest swing state in the country. I found myself once again capturing with those individual moments that continued to tell a larger story.</p>
<p>But it also became a story about change, ironically. The experience in 2012 was quite different than that of 2008. No longer was I inexperienced, soley hope-driven, or naive. The Obama Generation of campaign staff quite frankly had grown up.</p>
<p>The journey is equal parts inspiring and grueling. Its about hope, but at the same time its about the jadedness we all found ourselves saddled with at different points. About victory and defeat. The highs and the lows. And most importantly, the how and the why of a group of young staffers who came together twice to change the world.</p>
<p>There are 300 drawings from the 2008 election juxtaposed with 300 from the 2012 election. The theme of change carries over into the artwork itself, as I grew a great deal during my work on this project.</p>
<p>Many books will be written that tell the story of the candidate, or the candidate's top advisors. But we were the foot soldiers right on the frontline. And in many states, we were the margin of victory.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The project will be released in the form of two E-Books. If I raise enough money, I will be making an effort to also produce hard copies of the book as well. The 2008 E-Book will be released in January of 2013. The 2012 E-Book will be released in July of 2013, due to the time it will take to complete the artwork. If you donate to receive both E-Books, you will receive the first one in January and the second seperately.</p>
<p>If you pledge to receive a print or original drawing, you will receive access to a doc to choose which one you would like. You can choose one of the drawings already completed, or monitor the doc as new drawings are added from 2012, if you have more interest in that cycle.</p>

</p><p></p><p>My name is <b>Elena Mazzi </b>and I am an <b>Italian artist. </b>My work deals with the relationship between man and the environment in which he/she lives and with which he must reckon on a daily basis. This analysis, which often follows an anthropological approach, investigates and documents an identity which is at the same time personal and collective, relating to a specific territory, and giving rise to forms of exchange and transformation. </p><p></p><p><i><b>Reflecting Venice</b></i> is my last art project. This is the result of a collaboration <b>Isomorph</b>, research enterprise directed by <b>professor and scientist Hans Grassmann (</b><b>Udine University)</b>, that works in the field of experimental physics to project new systems of energy development<b>.</b></p><p><i>Reflecting Venice</i> is <b>a project that investigates the possibility
of responding to last year’s increase of environmental issues
affecting Venice. </b>Through the application of an interdisciplinary methodology, Reflecting Venice explores technological innovation and
its implications. </p>
<p>The <b>interdisciplinary experimentation </b>promoted by Reflecting Venice
is intended as a tool to create a<b> responsible artistic
practice</b>.This includes deeper analysis of environmental issues in the region along with the intention of understanding
and ultimately remedying them through the medium of art.</p><p>The starting point is a specific area of Venetian territory: <b>Murano island</b>. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Known on a global scale for its <b>hand-made glass production</b>, today the island is facing a gradual transformation.
While it remains a precious historical and cultural heritage, it conversely displays a fetishized representation of
international mass tourism.</span></p>
<p><i>Reflecting Venice</i> focuses the attention on the peculiar technique
of <b>engraving on mirrors</b>, a <b>typical local craft tradition</b>
that is rapidly being replaced by simpler glass items, easy
to sell to tourists. My intervention consists in re-elaborating the flower decorative elements typical from the 17th and 18th centuries.These will be been substituted with the iconography of <b>flowers
and plants from Venice Lagoon, disappearing because of
the pollution</b>.
</p><p>By combining this decoration with issues of environmental disease, the project refers to the prototype of <b>Linear Mirror II</b>, experimented by physicist Hans Grassmann at Udine University, which provides <b>solar thermal energy at high temperatures also in winter, by using normal mirrors that reflect the solar light, referring to Archimeds' theory of reflecting mirrors.<span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""> </span></b></p><p><b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">new drawings I am experimenting with Murano’s masters on mirrors' production, will be directly addressed and portrayed
on the Linear Mirror II.</span></b></p><p>
The artwork, consisting in a functional installation, will be exhibited during the next <b>Venice Architecture Biennale (June-August 2014)</b>, as a collateral event, and then will move to Stockholm for <b>Fittja Biennal (September-November 2014)</b>.</p><p>The project has been supported by <b>Botkyrka Konsthall</b> in Stockholm, <b>Isomorph</b>, <b>Fondazione Bevilacqua La Masa Atelier programme</b>, and <b>Società di Mutuo Soccorso, Carpentieri e Calafati</b> in Venice, but it still needs a contribution to be finalized. </p><p>The money needed are intended only for production costs.</p><p>Here the blog of the project: <a href=""http://reflectingvenice.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://reflectingvenice.tumblr.com/</a></p>

I received my BFA in 2007 in History of Art from Siena University, and my MFA in 2011 in Visual Art from IUAV, Venice University. I spent a semester as guest student at Royal Academy of Art (Konsthögskolan) of Stockholm. I have been included in solo and collective international exhibitions.  In 2011 I attended Future Farmers A.I.R., supported by G.A.I. Italian prize for young Italian artists abroad. In 2012 I won Fondazione Lerici grant for an exhibition at the Italian Institute of Culture in Stockholm, and I have been selected for the annual workshop with Tim Rollins &amp; K.O.S. at Fondazione Spinola Banna in Turin. In 2013 I have been invited to participate in Dolomiti contemporanee project and I was the winner of one-year studio space at Bevilacqua La Masa Foundation in Venice. I was one of the finalists at Celeste Prize and in 2014 I have been selected for EGE-European glass experience travelling exhibition.

</p><p>Mi chiamo Elena Mazzi e sono
un'<b>artista italiana</b>. Il mio lavoro indaga il rapporto tra l'uomo e
l'ambiente ad esso circostante, nel quale vive e con il quale si
confronta ogni giorno. Attraverso un approccio di tipo antropologico
metto in pratica un processo finalizzato alla comprensione e all’
analisi di un’identità, al contempo personale e collettiva, legata
ad uno specifico territorio.</p><p><i><b>Reflecting Venice</b></i> è il mio
ultimo lavoro artistico. Esso è frutto di una collaborazione con
l’impresa di ricerca <b>Isomorph</b>, diretta dal professor <b>Hans Grassmann
(Università di Udine)</b>, che opera nel campo della fisica sperimentale
per la progettazione di nuovi sistemi di sviluppo energetico.<br/>Si
tratta di un progetto che investiga le <b>possibilità d’intervento
sulle problematiche ambientali della città di Venezia,</b> fortemente
accentuatesi negli ultimi anni. Attraverso una metodologia di lavoro
interdisciplinare, <i>Reflecting Venice</i> esplora l’<b>innovazione

dar luogo a una <b>pratica artistica responsabile</b>. Questo implica
un'analisi più approfondita delle problematiche ambientali locali,
allo scopo di proporre una soluzione realistica attraverso il medium
artistico.</span></p><p>Punto di partenza del progetto è
stato lo studio di un’area specifica del territorio veneziano:
l’<b>isola di Murano</b>. Conosciuta su scala globale per la <b>produzione
artigianale del vetro</b>, l’intera isola subisce oggi un graduale
processo di trasformazione, fino ad apparire luogo delle dicotomie:
da una parte, patrimonio culturale e storico, dall’altra, feticcio
rappresentativo del turismo di massa internazionale.<br/><br/><i>Refletting
Venice</i>  focalizza l’attenzione su una <b>tipica lavorazione
artigianale locale </b>che sta oggi scomparendo, per lasciare posto alla
produzione di oggettistica più facilmente commerciabile: la
<b>decorazione a incisione sugli specchi</b>. In particolare, il mio
intervento sarà costituito dalla <b>rielaborazione degli elementi
floreali </b>di matrice seicentesca e settecentesca che costituiscono il
motivo decorativo più utilizzato nell’incisione degli specchi.
Tali elementi verranno sostituiti con la raffigurazione di <b>specie

My work deals with the relationship between man and the environment in which he/she lives and with which he must reckon on a daily basis. This analysis, which often follows an anthropological approach, investigates and documents an identity which is at the same time personal and collective, relating to a specific territory, and giving rise to forms of exchange and transformation. Reflecting Venice is my last art project. This is the result of a collaboration Isomorph, research enterprise directed by professor and scientist Hans Grassmann (Udine University), that works in the field of experimental physics to project new systems of energy development.Reflecting Venice is a project that investigates the possibility
of responding to last year’s increase of environmental issues
affecting Venice. Through the application of an interdisciplinary methodology, Reflecting Venice explores technological innovation and
its implications. 
The interdisciplinary experimentation promoted by Reflecting Venice
is intended as a tool to create a responsible artistic
practice.This includes deeper analysis of environmental issues in the region along with the intention of understanding
and ultimately remedying them through the medium of art.The starting point is a specific area of Venetian territory: Murano island. Known on a global scale for its hand-made glass production, today the island is facing a gradual transformation.
While it remains a precious historical and cultural heritage, it conversely displays a fetishized representation of
international mass tourism.
Reflecting Venice focuses the attention on the peculiar technique
of engraving on mirrors, a typical local craft tradition
that is rapidly being replaced by simpler glass items, easy
to sell to tourists. My intervention consists in re-elaborating the flower decorative elements typical from the 17th and 18th centuries.These will be been substituted with the iconography of flowers
and plants from Venice Lagoon, disappearing because of
the pollution.
By combining this decoration with issues of environmental disease, the project refers to the prototype of Linear Mirror II, experimented by physicist Hans Grassmann at Udine University, which provides solar thermal energy at high temperatures also in winter, by using normal mirrors that reflect the solar light, referring to Archimeds' theory of reflecting mirrors. The new drawings I am experimenting with Murano’s masters on mirrors' production, will be directly addressed and portrayed
on the Linear Mirror II.
The artwork, consisting in a functional installation, will be exhibited during the next Venice Architecture Biennale (June-August 2014), as a collateral event, and then will move to Stockholm for Fittja Biennal (September-November 2014).The project has been supported by Botkyrka Konsthall in Stockholm, Isomorph, Fondazione Bevilacqua La Masa Atelier programme, and Società di Mutuo Soccorso, Carpentieri e Calafati in Venice, but it still needs a contribution to be finalized. The money needed are intended only for production costs.Here the blog of the project: http://reflectingvenice.tumblr.com/


About me:I was born in 1984 in Reggio Emilia (Italy). I received my BFA in 2007 in History of Art from Siena University, and my MFA in 2011 in Visual Art from IUAV, Venice University. I spent a semester as guest student at Royal Academy of Art (Konsthögskolan) of Stockholm. I have been included in solo and collective international exhibitions.  In 2011 I attended Future Farmers A.I.R., supported by G.A.I. Italian prize for young Italian artists abroad. In 2012 I won Fondazione Lerici grant for an exhibition at the Italian Institute of Culture in Stockholm, and I have been selected for the annual workshop with Tim Rollins & K.O.S. at Fondazione Spinola Banna in Turin. In 2013 I have been invited to participate in Dolomiti contemporanee project and I was the winner of one-year studio space at Bevilacqua La Masa Foundation in Venice. I was one of the finalists at Celeste Prize and in 2014 I have been selected for EGE-European glass experience travelling exhibition. My work is always been supported by public grants, here you can check out my website and my portfoliowww.elenamazzi.com--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ITALIANO
Mi chiamo Elena Mazzi e sono
un'artista italiana. Il mio lavoro indaga il rapporto tra l'uomo e
l'ambiente ad esso circostante, nel quale vive e con il quale si
confronta ogni giorno. Attraverso un approccio di tipo antropologico
metto in pratica un processo finalizzato alla comprensione e all’
analisi di un’identità, al contempo personale e collettiva, legata
ad uno specifico territorio.Reflecting Venice è il mio
ultimo lavoro artistico. Esso è frutto di una collaborazione con
l’impresa di ricerca Isomorph, diretta dal professor Hans Grassmann
(Università di Udine), che opera nel campo della fisica sperimentale
per la progettazione di nuovi sistemi di sviluppo energetico.Si
tratta di un progetto che investiga le possibilità d’intervento
sulle problematiche ambientali della città di Venezia, fortemente
accentuatesi negli ultimi anni. Attraverso una metodologia di lavoro
interdisciplinare, Reflecting Venice esplora l’innovazione
tecnologica e le sue potenzialità espressive.La sperimentazione interdisciplinare
promossa da Reflecting Venice è intesa come strumento per
dar luogo a una pratica artistica responsabile. Questo implica
un'analisi più approfondita delle problematiche ambientali locali,
allo scopo di proporre una soluzione realistica attraverso il medium
artistico.Punto di partenza del progetto è
stato lo studio di un’area specifica del territorio veneziano:
l’isola di Murano. Conosciuta su scala globale per la produzione
artigianale del vetro, l’intera isola subisce oggi un graduale
processo di trasformazione, fino ad apparire luogo delle dicotomie:
da una parte, patrimonio culturale e storico, dall’altra, feticcio
rappresentativo del turismo di massa internazionale.Refletting
Venice  focalizza l’attenzione su una tipica lavorazione
artigianale locale che sta oggi scomparendo, per lasciare posto alla
produzione di oggettistica più facilmente commerciabile: la
decorazione a incisione sugli specchi. In particolare, il mio
intervento sarà costituito dalla rielaborazione degli elementi
floreali di matrice seicentesca e settecentesca che costituiscono il
motivo decorativo più utilizzato nell’incisione degli specchi.
Tali elementi verranno sostituiti con la raffigurazione di specie
floreali in pericolo della laguna veneziana.Combinando questa decorazione alle problematiche ambientali
locali, il progetto fa riferimento allo Specchio Lineare II,
sperimentato appunto dal fisico Hans Grassmann presso l'Università
di Udine, che fornisce energia solare ad alte temperature anche in
inverno, attraverso una combinazione di normali specchi che
riflettono la luce solare riprendendo la teoria di Archimede degli
specchi riflettenti.Le nuove decorazioni floreali, create in
collaborazione con i maestri muranesi, saranno realizzate
direttamente sugli specchi dello Specchio Lineare II.
L'opera d'arte, che consiste in un'installazione funzionante, sarà esposta all'interno della prossima Biennale d'Architettura di Venezia (Giugno-Agosto 2014) come evento collaterale, e andrà poi a Stoccolma per la Biennale di Fittja (Settembre-Novembre 2014).Il progetto è supportato da Botrkyrka Konsthall di Stoccolma, Isomorph,programma di Atelier della Fondazione Bevilacqua La Masa e Società di Mutuo Soccorso, Carpentieri e Calafati a Venezia, ma ha ancora bisogno di un contributo per essere portato a termine.La somma richiesta è intesa solamente per costi di produzione.Qui il link al blog del progetto: http://reflectingvenice.tumblr.com/Su di me:

<p><strong>MARTHA</strong> Loving is an Artist, Educator, and Art Therapist trained in The Netherlands in Painting Therapy according to methods developed by Liane Collot d’Herbois (1907-1999). Ms. Loving is one of seven women practicing this <em>medical</em> therapy in the USA, having received a diploma from the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland. The artistic AND therapeutic methods developed by Collot d’Herbois work with the Universal Principles of LIGHT, COLOR, and DARKNESS as we see them in Nature.</p>
<p><strong>COLLOT</strong> was a Master painter, producing works of art that are beautiful and healing to behold. Most of her works are held in private collections rarely seen by the public.</p>
<p><strong>MS. LOVING</strong> has been presented with A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY to purchase an original Collot veil painting for educational purposes and public exhibitions. The veil painting, “The Rose” was painted in 1982. Your donations will further the cultural education and understanding of this unique approach to art and painting therapy, without which the magnitude of Collot’s work will be lost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE</strong> estimated costs for this project are:</p>
<p>$2,000 is for the purchase of the painting; $500 is for framing the painting with museum glass and quality matting; $350 covers costs of the initial exhibition of “The Rose”; $150 covers costs of printing postcards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE</strong> work with LIGHT, COLOR, and DARKNESS has tremendous applications in the world. Ms. Loving has been working with these principles in both artistic and therapeutics practice for nearly 20 years. She has been exhibiting her work internationally for more than 30 years. The direct effects of working with these principles include major transformations in one’s inner life, bringing balance and harmony to oneself and the world. Contemplating works like “The Rose” brings a healing effect to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE</strong> help us spread the word about this project! You can use the Indiegogo share tools and like on my “Thinking with the Heart” Facebook page. Thank you!</p></div>","Painting in Light and Darkness

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Ingress is a game. A game of virtual chess,  a game of exploration, a game of international intrigue and most importantly a game of social connections.   In this game,  you'll find locations in the world and capture them for your team.  <i>In this project, we not only find the locations, but we make them</i>,  and the virtual status of the in-game location will control the lights and sound of the piece.  Its a feedback loop.  And it is incentive to build some art in the stunning redwoods of Navarro, CA; art controlled by augmented reality. </p>
<p>We are making a participatory, techno-magical, three dimensional cavernous space, for real.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are Camp Listener: a burner-flavored, cross faction, Ingress art making team</li>
<li>We believe that making art is a fundamental engagement that builds community, encourages storytelling, and in the case of this event, it brings some much needed reality to augmented reality.</li>
<li>As a contributor, you will help us achieve a wonderful installation, the second in this series, that takes the light that you bring to the art and reminds you of the reciprocity of energies in the game and in our lives.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>To make this magic happen: we need approximately 1,200 dollars to avoid significantly taxing our camp team members -- this will only cover the materials, technology, printing, needed tools and services, rewards, fees, and postage. (Personal travel expenses and entry fees will not be covered.)</li>
<li>Contributors will receive unique gifts - buttons, patches, jewelry, custom wearables, or even a panel of the art that can be installed at your home, barbecue, or local event/anomaly.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, we will scale back as needed.  However, we have been trying to be frugal and rely on as much borrowed resources as much as we can.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>More explanation about our campaign and the difference our contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>What makes this important is the art.  The participatory experience and dialogue it encourages is important.  It's important for folks to have the opportunity to shift their experience and make things and take risks that they might not have had the chance to do otherwise.</li>
<li>While this is the second piece in this Ingress series,  these installations have been made by Hapto dating back to 2004 at Burning Man and East Coast Regionals. Most of these projects have been successfully funded by event grants and generous donors.  She will do what she sets out to do and will put forward the best effort with the available resources.   </li>
<li>This is the most ambitious piece to date. Over 1000 feet of reflective materials, adhered to nearly invisible fabric.  The floating images are like no other. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have lots of experience, but our challenges are primarily in transportation and funding.  We are traveling from Wisconsin, Hawaii, Arizona (and other places) and this gives a challenge or building the piece in advance and getting it from here to there.    We will use the postal service if needed, and have secured staging homes in California to collect the art and needed tools and technology on the West coast.  We will try for alternatives if we can, as we are scrappy, flexible and very determined.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know some of your are just as broke as we are, and any sharing, or asks you can make on our behalf are helpful.   Also if you are in the Milwaukee area, feel free to ping Hapto, as there might be opportunities to help make the art, or if you would like to bring this art to an event near you!  If you are interested in joining us and helping on site in Northern California, please sign up!  <a href=""http://events.ingress.com/magnus/osiris/navarro"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://events.ingress.com/magnus/osiris/navarro</a></p>

<p><b>What Is BACG?</b><br/></p>
<p>Bushwick Art Crit Group (BACG) is part networking &amp; creative development community and part think-tank for the visual arts in Bushwick. BACG launched in March 2013 with a monthly art crit group where 6-7 artists present their work to gallerists, curators, other artists, and members of the Bushwick community. While the monthly crit group remains at our core, BACG expanded into group exhibitions and art fairs in late 2013 (most recently as a participant at the echo Art Fair in Buffalo, NY) and art panel discussions in 2014.</p>

<p>My work has always desired to go against

</h3> <p>Hello - My name is Anton Viditz-Ward. <br/></p>
<p>I am currently building a new art piece for Burning Man 2014. I live and work in Telluride, CO, with our studio space at Deep Creek Mine. My crew and I build these projects with funding from Burning Man, our local Arts council, and fundraisers we hold at my studio. However, these sources of funding are not enough. I am asking for your help, to offset the out of pocket costs of providing artwork this size for the masses. If you have seen my projects at Burning Man in the past, I hope you will be driven to help us get a whole new sculpture out to the playa. If you are new to my work, check out the pictures and video to get an idea of what we are doing. These have been some of the most mesmerizing natural fire sculptures at the event in the last several years. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>I put lots of time planning the look and feel of this piece to work it into this years theme, Caravansary. The detail work will include rotoscope style cutouts and images on the sides of the wheels. The base structure has Rumi script laser cut into it. The hand cranks for operating the wheels are newly cut and architecturally designed. The overall concept of fire and crowd interaction has been embraced and brought to the forefront.<br/></p>
<p>The money raised will be used to pay for steel, transportation, and all wearable materials used to build the project (like welding supplies, chains, gears, nuts, bolts, etc....). I build these projects with no pay, and my volunteers all work for free and hold full time jobs. We bring these projects to Burning Man to share with the community, and we also display and share these works locally when we can.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional artwork, these contraptions are costly to build and maintain, and will slowly destroy themselves over time. They require a lot of maintenance to run, as well as countless hours for our volunteers to manage spectator safety, debris clean up, and set up/tear down. We also incur a good bit of costs getting them back and forth to the playa (steel is heavy!).<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We have purchased raw materials, but we still need your help:</p> <ul>
<li>Funds raised will cover our construction costs, as well as transportation back and forth to the event.<br/>
</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, every dollar donated will be used to make the project a reality and get the project and our crew out to Burning Man.<br/>
</li>
<li>If we go over our goal, we will use excess money to make improvements to our studio, purchase tools and equipment, and continue working even harder to bring exciting new interactive artwork to the public.</li>
<li>We have some great perks! (We have decided to skip the stickers, shirts and other trinkets, which ultimately cost us more money) Check them out, donate, then come spend some time with the crew out on the playa.<br/>

My crew and I build these projects with funding from Burning Man, our local Arts council, and fundraisers we hold at my studio. However, these sources of funding are not enough. I am asking for your help, to offset the out of pocket costs of providing artwork this size for the masses. If you have seen my projects at Burning Man in the past, I hope you will be driven to help us get a whole new sculpture out to the playa. If you are new to my work, check out the pictures and video to get an idea of what we are doing. These have been some of the most mesmerizing natural fire sculptures at the event in the last several years. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
I put lots of time planning the look and feel of this piece to work it into this years theme, Caravansary. The detail work will include rotoscope style cutouts and images on the sides of the wheels. The base structure has Rumi script laser cut into it. The hand cranks for operating the wheels are newly cut and architecturally designed. The overall concept of fire and crowd interaction has been embraced and brought to the forefront.
The money raised will be used to pay for steel, transportation, and all wearable materials used to build the project (like welding supplies, chains, gears, nuts, bolts, etc....). I build these projects with no pay, and my volunteers all work for free and hold full time jobs. We bring these projects to Burning Man to share with the community, and we also display and share these works locally when we can.
Unlike traditional artwork, these contraptions are costly to build and maintain, and will slowly destroy themselves over time. They require a lot of maintenance to run, as well as countless hours for our volunteers to manage spectator safety, debris clean up, and set up/tear down. We also incur a good bit of costs getting them back and forth to the playa (steel is heavy!).

  What We Need & What You Get We have purchased raw materials, but we still need your help: 
Funds raised will cover our construction costs, as well as transportation back and forth to the event.

If we don't reach our goal, every dollar donated will be used to make the project a reality and get the project and our crew out to Burning Man.

If we go over our goal, we will use excess money to make improvements to our studio, purchase tools and equipment, and continue working even harder to bring exciting new interactive artwork to the public.
We have some great perks! (We have decided to skip the stickers, shirts and other trinkets, which ultimately cost us more money) Check them out, donate, then come spend some time with the crew out on the playa.
 
  
Past Projects
 I have built five of these projects for Burning Man and our community in the past: 

Fire Spinner (2007)  
 
The Wheel of Thwarted Ambition (2008)

Palindrome (2009)

Towering Inferno (2010)

Bapteme Du Feu (2012) 
  
Other Ways You Can Help Some people can't contribute money, but that doesn't mean they can't help: 
If you can't donate, please spread the word and get this to someone who can . If you can help at Burning Man, we can use a hand cleaning up nightly at the project, you can help us run it, or you can help us take it down and load it to go home.  Please share this campaign on Facebook, through personal emails, anywhere that will get the word out and make this a success. Tell anyone and everyone you know in the Burning Man community!

People and Louise S. McGehee School.  She
attended Newcomb College, The University of Florence, and took classes at the
New Orleans Academy of Fine Arts.  For as
long as she can remember she has been drawing “funny” little things that amuse
her.  In the 1970s she began painting her
version of landscapes with buildings and little blue and green trees.  In the 80s she added her version of little
people into the landscapes.  And in the
90s, she began incorporating New Orleans characters into her paintings.  In 2005 Antoinette K-Doe invited Ann to join
the Ernie K-Doe Baby Dolls.  They marched
in the Krewe of Muses parade and had a wonderful time struttin’ down the street
showing off their “linens.”  Ann loves
New Orleans, its traditions, and the magic of Mardi Gras.  As she says “In my pictures, my Baby Dolls do
all the things I do and all the wild, crazy things I don’t dare do—I love them
and have so much fun with them!”  And,
since 2005, she appears in her pictures. 
She is not hard to find!</p><p></p><p>Karen T. La Beau is a native of New
 Orleans that now resides in Shreveport,
 La.  She is a self taught, third generation
artist. Karen began drawing at that age of 6. She began professionally painting
in 2007. That is when she began her series of, “My Life on Canvas.” She said,
“I’ve chose to tell my story through visual art. To me, telling my history on
canvas, vinyl albums and wood is far more interesting then writing it down on
paper. Since my history primarily revolves around the culture of New Orleans and my life in Shreveport as well as happenings all over the
state, it’s my goal to exhibit “My Life on Canvas” across the state.”
Currently, she is preparing for a solo exhibit titled, “When a Man Loves a
Woman.” Karen has private collectors all over the country from California to Maryland.
She was honored as a woman artist by the North Louisiana
 Multicultural Center
two years in a row. Several years ago, she began teaching middle school
children art in an after school outreach program (Noel Community Arts Program). </p><p></p><p>Jamar Duvol Pierre has said that “My introduction to the art world was public art.” Crisp and defined works, beautiful people, rich culture, timeless memories, raw emotions and genuine passion. These are all conclusions one may draw from the first glance at an authentic J. Pierre work. J. Pierre is a celebrated New Orleans artist who vividly gives life to the side of New Orleans that tourists never see. J. Pierre: painter, illustrator, and designer has changed the face of New Orleans art in the eyes of international markets and has worked in an unprecedented variety of styles. His fan base is just as rich and diverse as his work. Any J. Pierre creation is sure to leave a taste of the<i> joie de vivre</i> of New Orleans on your mind, heart and soul.</p><p>Steve Prince has said about his art, ”That’s where my visual ministry is focused. That’s where my church is. My art becomes a traveling evangelism show for our contemporary culture, providing answers for today’s troubled world. But it also becomes a celebration; a celebration of that very broken yet extremely beautiful world. The art becomes a bridge to help people find their way from that brokenness to the beauty that I so clearly see.”  He is an artist and art professor residing in Silver Spring, MD concerned with the conditions of humanity and the challenges we face in a society that erodes our sense of true community and communal togetherness. His art creatively explores the challenges and solutions to life's moral, ethical, and spiritual dilemmas. ""Bird in Hand: Second Line for Michigan"" (pictured in part in the promotional video above) is offered as a symbol for Michigan as it grieves it's economic loss and unites together to rebuild and renew its future.  For more see: <a href=""http://imagejournal.org/page/journal/articles/issue-78/prince-interview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">An Interview with Steve Prince by Beth McCoy</a>.</p><p>Aleta Richard is the teaching artist for McDonogh 42 Elementary Charter School located in the New Orleans historic area, the Treme.  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In 2013 she organized her students’ participation in “Home

The evening featured performances by the dance troupe, poets and
the drum line. Students were ecstatic to hang their art and photographs in
a formal gallery setting; for many of whom this was their first
exhibition.  One of her students recalled about the experience that ""Some
of my favorite things about Home in New Orleans were being able to learn new
kinds of dances with my friends, going to the museums, and learning all the
history about the art.""  In that same year, her students made the signature favors, small hand-made masks for the opening exhibit of the ""They Call Me Baby Doll: A Mardi Gras Tradition"" held of the Louisiana State Museum Presbytere.  Ms Richard will guide her students to create a visual work that will be used for the exhibition poster for this exhibit ""Contemporary Artists respond to The New Orleans Baby Dolls"". </span></p><p><b>The Jurors: </b> Three Jurors  will select and cultivate the work for the exhibition.</p><p>Mora Beauchamp-Byrd, Ph.D., Interim Director New Orleans African American Museum, is a curator and art historian who specializes in African American Art, the art of the African Diaspora, 18th century British art and visual culture, and contemporary British art with a particular focus on British artists of African, Asian and Caribbean descent.

He is a painter that has exhibited his work nationally and internationally. Mr. Bechet intends for the compositions to be metaphors for abstract concepts and difficult realities, questions of what is real and what is delusional.

paper. Since my history primarily revolves around the culture of New Orleans and my life in Shreveport as well as happenings all over the
state, it’s my goal to exhibit “My Life on Canvas” across the state.”
Currently, she is preparing for a solo exhibit titled, “When a Man Loves a
Woman.” Karen has private collectors all over the country from California to Maryland.
She was honored as a woman artist by the North Louisiana
 Multicultural Center
two years in a row. Several years ago, she began teaching middle school
children art in an after school outreach program (Noel Community Arts Program). Jamar Duvol Pierre has said that “My introduction to the art world was public art.” Crisp and defined works, beautiful people, rich culture, timeless memories, raw emotions and genuine passion. These are all conclusions one may draw from the first glance at an authentic J. Pierre work. J. Pierre is a celebrated New Orleans artist who vividly gives life to the side of New Orleans that tourists never see. J. Pierre: painter, illustrator, and designer has changed the face of New Orleans art in the eyes of international markets and has worked in an unprecedented variety of styles. His fan base is just as rich and diverse as his work. Any J. Pierre creation is sure to leave a taste of the joie de vivre of New Orleans on your mind, heart and soul.Steve Prince has said about his art, ”That’s where my visual ministry is focused. That’s where my church is. My art becomes a traveling evangelism show for our contemporary culture, providing answers for today’s troubled world. But it also becomes a celebration; a celebration of that very broken yet extremely beautiful world. The art becomes a bridge to help people find their way from that brokenness to the beauty that I so clearly see.”  He is an artist and art professor residing in Silver Spring, MD concerned with the conditions of humanity and the challenges we face in a society that erodes our sense of true community and communal togetherness. His art creatively explores the challenges and solutions to life's moral, ethical, and spiritual dilemmas. ""Bird in Hand: Second Line for Michigan"" (pictured in part in the promotional video above) is offered as a symbol for Michigan as it grieves it's economic loss and unites together to rebuild and renew its future.  For more see: An Interview with Steve Prince by Beth McCoy.Aleta Richard is the teaching artist for McDonogh 42 Elementary Charter School located in the New Orleans historic area, the Treme.  In 2013 she organized her students’ participation in “Home
in New Orleans”, an interdisciplinary enrichment program for 5th through 8th
grades from McDonogh 42 Elementary Charter School the culminating
performance and gallery show took place at the George and Leah McKenna Museum.
The evening featured performances by the dance troupe, poets and
the drum line. Students were ecstatic to hang their art and photographs in
a formal gallery setting; for many of whom this was their first
exhibition.  One of her students recalled about the experience that ""Some
of my favorite things about Home in New Orleans were being able to learn new
kinds of dances with my friends, going to the museums, and learning all the
history about the art.""  In that same year, her students made the signature favors, small hand-made masks for the opening exhibit of the ""They Call Me Baby Doll: A Mardi Gras Tradition"" held of the Louisiana State Museum Presbytere.  Ms Richard will guide her students to create a visual work that will be used for the exhibition poster for this exhibit ""Contemporary Artists respond to The New Orleans Baby Dolls"". The Jurors:  Three Jurors  will select and cultivate the work for the exhibition.Mora Beauchamp-Byrd, Ph.D., Interim Director New Orleans African American Museum, is a curator and art historian who specializes in African American Art, the art of the African Diaspora, 18th century British art and visual culture, and contemporary British art with a particular focus on British artists of African, Asian and Caribbean descent. She has served as Assistant Professor of Art History, Department of Art, and Curator of Art Collections, Xavier University of Louisiana. Ron Bechet M.F.A was born in New Orleans and holds a B.A. degree in Fine Arts from the University of New Orleans and an M.F.A. in Painting and Drawing from the Yale School of Art, Yale University. He is the Victor H. Labat Professor of Art at Xavier University of Louisiana. Mr. Bechet is the Chair of the Art Department at Xavier University. He is a painter that has exhibited his work nationally and internationally. Mr. Bechet intends for the compositions to be metaphors for abstract concepts and difficult realities, questions of what is real and what is delusional. The rich visual traditions, icons and symbols from Bechet’ s upbringing in New Orleans influence his work, as do his reflections on rituals and formal spiritual practice, particularly from African based cultures. Pamela Franco, Ph.D. is a native Trinidadian and earned a PhD in art history from Emory University in Atlanta. She works as a Executive Associate to the Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs at Xavier University. Before that she was an Assistant Professor of Art History at Tulane University. She was a member of the Newcomb Gallery Advisory Board. She was also the Director of a summer abroad program to Trinidad and Tobago. She has been instrumental in organizing symposia and exhibitions on African and Caribbean Art.Exhibit Organizers: Kim Marie Vaz, Ph.D. grew up in New Orleans and
attended St. Mary’s Academy and Tulane
University’s Newcomb College.  She earned her doctorate in Educational
Psychology from Indiana University in Bloomington.  She is the author of The
‘Baby Dolls’: Breaking the Race and Gender Barriers of the New Orleans Mardi
Gras Tradition (Louisiana State University Press).  Her book served as the basis for a 2013 major
installation on the Baby Doll tradition at the Presbytere unit of the Louisiana
State Museum as part of the museum’s permanent display on the history of
Carnival in Louisiana.  Ron Bechet is a native of New Orleans and a relative of the early jazz pioneer Sidney Bechet. He began drawing in the fourth grade, studied art at the University of New Orleans and went on to earn a graduate degree from Yale University. He his art teaching career began at Delgado Community College, then at Southern University in New Orleans and, since 1998, at Xavier. Even though he is a celebrated and accomplished artist, he feels he learns as much about himself and his art while teaching as his students do in their own studies. One of the biggest influences on his recent work was fellow art professor at Xavier, the renowned sculptor, the late John T. Scott. Jennifer Williams is Museum Director and Curator of The McKenna Museum of African American Art.  She received her B.A. in History with a concentration in Art History from Georgia State University in Atlanta, GA. With the guiding spirit of her parent’s dedication of serving others throughout their lives, she moved to New Orleans to serve as an AmeriCorps VISTA coordinating projects with the Tulane University Center for Public Service at a community center in the 7th ward. Serving 3 terms over, her commitment to social justice has grown.  As curator she has the responsibility of finding artists willing and interested in supporting the McKenna by allowing the museum to feature and showcase their work within the city. Funding Use: Funds will be used to help defray the cost of insuring the collection, installation and publicity.  Additional funding over the pledged amount will be used to design and distribute a catalog, for educational programming, for an opening reception, and to defray the cost of  associated fees such as postage for mailing the rewards . Rewards: For their contribution each backer will receive recognition on social media (e.g., the exhibit's Facebook page and website) and his or her name on our list of donors on display at the exhibition. Depending on the amount pledged backers can receive up to three digital copies or prints of a Baby Doll masking by one of three well regarded photographers, an exhibition poster, a commemorative second-line handkerchief and bead throw, an autographed copy of the book, ""The Baby Dolls"" by Kim Vaz, and a docent tour of the exhibit by one of the organizers.  We would like to thank the three highly regarded photographers for allowing us to use their photographs as gifts to our backers: Romain Breauxis, Phillip Colwart, and Kim Welsh.Biographies of Photographers:Romain Breauxis is originally from France and is an avid explorer of New Orleans and Southern Louisiana culture. Through his photos, he tries to capture some of the richness, joyfulness and fascination that he has witnessed during his adventures!Phillip Colwart was born in Baton Rouge and raised in New Orleans.  He is a Hammond-based professional photographer who contributes his time and photography to the Mardi Gras Indian, Baby Doll and Skull & Bones community.  Having grown to appreciate and value this culture, Phillip gives back to these groups through his photography and thus helps to preserve and perpetuate these traditions.Kim Welsh enjoys capturing the flavor of urban cultural life and celebration in our unique home, New Orleans. She advocates for cultural preservation and aim to understand the unique world view of her subjects and to respectfully translate that using visual imagery. For Welsh, our diverse, vibrant, and spectacular cultural traditions should always be protected and encouraged as they are our treasure which enriches our lives and often goes unappreciated.Profile Image:  A frame from circa 1928-1931 footage of the Baby Dolls on Mardi Gras in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Image is owned by Story Sloane’s Galleries Inc., one of the largest private sources for vintage and historic photography in the south.  For more visit: http://www.sloanegallery.com/Other Ways You Can Help•Help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.•Use the Indiegogo share tools.•Leave comments on this page about our campaign.•Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/artaboutbabydolls?ref=hl•Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/artaboutBD•You can make ""in-kind"" donations.  For example, if you are a caterer, we'd love to discuss with you the opportunity for you to donate your catering services for the opening reception.  If you are a printer, we would love for you to donate to the project by donating your service to print our exhibit poster.•Want to know more?

<h3>""Doppler Shift"" in Summary</h3>
<p>I'm interested in the Manhattan Grid as an example of an urban development that directs certain kinds human relations. Through formal elements of space, scale, and geometry, this construction informs the kinds of jobs, social classes, exchanges and politics present.

<p>""Doppler Shift"" is the second part of an artistic engagement, intervention, and comparison of basic human sensations in this place--sight, sound, feeling of confinement or agoraphobia. I've developed new visual techniques to capture and produce this work, while learning from other artists' (K. Wodiczko, Graffiti Research Lab) research and accomplishments. Using digital video projection to daylight architecture, storefrornts, streets and people of late-night New York, I am creating a panoramic, expanded video environment that will displace images of the city through time and space. The projections will be executed in neighborhoods all over the Manhattan Grid for people who may not regularly encounter contemporary art in the day-to-day or night-to-night schedules. </p>

<p><strong>ARTISTS 2 AFRICA</strong> was birthed from decades of artists discussing the prospect of organizing a group journey to Africa tailored specifically for artists and focused on art education. <strong>On October 19-30, 2013 we will embark on our second official journey to Ghana West Africa!<br/></strong></p>
<p>The artists will journey into the art villages on the outskirts of Ghana. Various artisans including painters, sculptors, and weavers will be gathered in their workshops to create and collaborate. We will fellowship with the artists and students, visit their workshops to share technique, and explore the creative process, while exchanging our creative ideas with the artisans in the region. An exhibition will be organized featuring the works of each artist. <strong>Our focus is to educate and connect through ART.</strong></p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">HOW WILL YOUR FUNDS BE UTILIZED?</strong></p>
<p>The campaign is to assist with acquiring art materials for this project and artists in Africa to use on our visit as we fellowship by creating art. We will be visiting 4 locations where ceramic, wood carving, fabric making and other artforms are taught and produced. We will introduce various art projects and will instruct several groups of artisans and other participants. Funds will assist with art supplies and materials, and small tools. We also plan to document this experience with photography and video as a future educational medium.

It wasn’t meant to be put online but things don’t always turn out the way we want obviously.As you can all imagine, the music industry (like every other field) is going to suffer a lot from what’s happening to all of us, and it will take months for technicians, booking agencies, promoters, venues, drivers, musicians, etc…to recover.We saw bands who performed in empty venues, for their last shows, and stream them so fans can still have a little bit of what could have been a great night.We salute them, that’s awesome, we wish we had the opportunity to do so, but we were on stage when we heard that show would be our last.We then decided to ask venues if it would be ok to perform twice every night so maybe 200 people could see us perform, for few more shows, or even for one last show, to let the magic do its work one last time, a little while longer, but it was too late.We salute those who managed to do it.Now, we also saw bands using crowdfunding to get out of this mess, we can’t judge that, we know the financial loss, but that’s not something we will do, that doesn’t seem right. All we have is our merch made for you, and it will remain magical no matter what.We’re thankful we were lucky enough to do half of our tour when some bands we know couldn’t even start, we’re blessed none of us personally knows someone who’s suffering from that virus right now, our thoughts to those who didn’t have that chance, our thoughts to those working 24/7 fighting the disease so we can all be safe as soon as possible.Stay home, stay safe, we’ll see you very soon.

<h3>Who is Tony?</h3>
<p><strong>Tony Guglietti</strong> has been called ""deliciously goofy"" by the New York Times.  The Village Voice has described his dancing as ""liquid.""  A critic from Dance Insider referred to him as ""the great straight hope of modern dance.""  We mention these things for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Humble brag. Obviously.</li>
<li>So you can make fun of Tony later about this <i>(Jesse Duval)</i>
</li>
<li>So you know this show is legit.  It's gonna be good: we promise.</li>
</ol>
<p>A little more about Tony: he received his BFA from Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. Upon graduation he became a founding member of Sean Curran Company, with whom he toured regularly across the United States, France, and Germany from 1998-2005. In 2012, Tony returned to Sean Curran Company to tour to Central Asia. <i>D</i><i>o you actually care about this? Are you still reading?  </i>Tony also performed with Brian Brooks Moving Company, Peter Pucci, and Joanna Mendl Shaw.  <i>do you know who those people are? are you impressed?  </i>Tony has been privileged to dance on some of New York’s finest stages, including Jazz at Lincoln Center, The Metropolitan Opera House, and three seasons at The Joyce Theater. <i>We promise, t</i><i>hat's actually a big deal even if you don't know about it</i>.  Now based in the Boston area, Tony is currently dancing with Brian Feigenbaum and Peter DiMuro/Public Displays of Motion, as well as collaborating on a series of duets with Kristin Wagner.</p>
<p>Outside of dance, Tony refs hockey, thinks hot dogs are a perfectly acceptable meal, eats too much fast food, and has absolutely no understanding of the internet and/or technology.  Kristin is writing this for him.  <strong>ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE</strong> Tony is an excellent painter (houses, not canvas) so if you need a fresh coat on your living room, check out <strong>Steady Guglietti Precision Painting</strong> on Facebook.  And, even if you don't really care about anything we wrote about his dance background, he is a pretty good dancer and choreographer.</p>
<h3>Who is Town Meeting?</h3>
<p>Winner's of the New England Music Award's ""2017 Roots Act of the Year"", <strong>Town Meeting</strong> is an folk/Americana/roots band from Boston, MA. Town Meeting is 100% committed to their live show. This is a band that is to be not only heard, but seen and experienced. While they sound great in a studio, to truly understand Town Meeting you must see them live. Playing primarily acoustic instruments they strive to bring the energy of rock and punk bands to a folk show. Town Meeting has had the privilege of warming up crowds for renowned artists such as Bob Dylan, Sturgill Simpson, Willie Nelson, Old Crow Medicine Show, The Avett Brothers, Third Eye Blind, Lettuce, The Dustbowl Revival, and many more. <i>W</i><i>e are thinking you are probably much more impressed by Town Meeting at this point than you are by Tony, and that's fine.  Town Meeting is awesome, except for Russ. Just kidding, Russ, Tony loves you.</i></p>
<h3>What is this show?</h3>
<p><i>Experience in Motion</i> will take place November 9 &amp; 10, 2018 at 8pm at The Dance Complex. Featuring original music by local folk/Americana band Town Meeting, this evening will pair live music and dance for a seamless blending of movement and sound.  Town Meeting is dedicated to providing audiences with a full auditory, visual, and emotional experience.  A series of dance vignettes will accompany the music, pulling from the band’s energy to create equally dynamic movement.  Part music concert and part modern dance concert, the evening will create a unique experience to be enjoyed by both dance and music enthusiasts alike.  The bar remains open in the theater throughout the performance, so even if you don't end up liking the show, you can always just drink a lot of beer.</p>
<p>Tony ran the dance department at The Pomfret School in CT (yes, that is fancy) from 2006-2012, and dance education is still something near and dear to Tony's heart.  He invited some local studios to join us in this show, and set some work on the awesome students of Wilmington Dance Academy (Wilmington, MA) and FreeForm Dance Academy (Westminster, MA). These awesome kiddos were actually really involved in the creation of the pieces, so come see what they made! It might be better than what Tony made.</p>
<p>Doors will open at 7:15pm, and audience are invited to take the floor and listen to a pre-show performance of Town Meeting before the professional dancers take the stage at 8pm.  Pre-sale General Admission tickets will be available online for $18, and there are discounts for students, seniors, and military.  Prices increase at the door, so if you are interested in coming, visit <a href=""http://experienceinmotion.eventbrite.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">experienceinmotion.eventbrite.com</a>!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<p>Simply put: money!</p>
<p>Dance shows are surprisingly expensive to produce, especially when you are paying every artist involved.  Tony's first priority with this show was to pay the dancers and musicians involved in this show - something that doesn't always happen in the art world.  Currently, all of the money for the production of this show is being paid straight from Tony's pockets.  All money raised by this IndieGoGo will be paid directly to the PEOPLE who are bringing this show to life.</p>
<p>The total of budgeted expenses for this show is just shy of <strong>$12,400</strong>.  The total projected box office revenue for this show is just over <strong>$2,500</strong>.  This leaves a <strong>net loss of about $10,000</strong> if Tony doesn't find additional financial support.  You can look at the breakdown of expenses in the fancy pie chart below.  All money going to artists is designated in shades of yellow; all other production expenses are in shades of red.  As you can see, this show will provide incredible financial support to over a dozen professionally performing artists in Massachusetts.  Please help support Tony in this mission!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This Campaign has required very detailed planning, development, and coordination with the artist and copywriter, translators and printers. I feel confident in my ability to publish this deck and fulfill rewards on time by February 2020.<br/><br/>I always make sure to realistically account for shipping costs and the additional costs for stretch goals. I've shipped many items worldwide from my previous Campaigns and now have an assistant (my hubby). We're no strangers to large shipping volumes worldwide. :)<br/><br/>The challenges are found in unforeseen issues involving mishaps in the printing or shipping of the decks to Los Angeles. We have back up plans in place in case any of the businesses we are dealing with should have severe issues.</p>

We know how upsetting steep shipping charges are. While we can’t control USPS costs we are only asking you to help with the actual cost to ship your items to you and to thank you for helping with the shipping I am gifting you a very special Akashic Clearing Session; a $22 value.
Risks & Challenges
This Campaign has required very detailed planning, development, and coordination with the artist and copywriter, translators and printers. I feel confident in my ability to publish this deck and fulfill rewards on time by February 2020.I always make sure to realistically account for shipping costs and the additional costs for stretch goals. I've shipped many items worldwide from my previous Campaigns and now have an assistant (my hubby). We're no strangers to large shipping volumes worldwide. :)The challenges are found in unforeseen issues involving mishaps in the printing or shipping of the decks to Los Angeles. We have back up plans in place in case any of the businesses we are dealing with should have severe issues.",6.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><b>ANALOG TO DIGITAL (Phase I)</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction and Goals</b></p>
<p>I am a multi-media artist who has
been engaged in pioneering work with interactive systems and video installation
since the early nineteen-eighties. You can learn more about me here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroslaw_Rogala"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroslaw_Rogala</a>.
</p>
<p>Over the past thirty years, I have
accumulated a vast video library, an archive of my work dating back to the
early years of video. Aside from the amount of space this takes up and the cost
of storage, I am concerned about preserving this work for the future and about
transferring it to a format that is compatible with present-day equipment so I
can continue to share it with the public.</p>
<p>The cost (and risk) of sending
these tapes out to a production house for transfer is steep and prohibitive.
What I propose instead is to purchase the equipment necessary for the transfer
and to hire one or two assistants to aid me with this enormous task. I am estimating
that the initial cost will be around twenty thousand dollars, which is the amount
I am hoping to raise and the reason I am asking for your support. </p>
<p><b>Why This is Important</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>This project is about historic preservation. Work that I have archived in my library documents some of the earliest experiments combining video with computers to create viewer interactive installations. These date back to a time when many of the applications we take for granted today had not been invented and programming skills were required to produce the most basic effects. </p>
<p>I also want to preserve my collaborations with other artists. For example, I have hours of tape documenting Chicago Imagist painter Ed Paschke working in his studio as well as interviews with him and other rare footage. I have also worked with Carolee Schneemann, Merce Cunningham, Shigeko Kubota and many other artists, performers and musicians, all captured on tape in my library. I even have unpublished footage of Czeslaw Niemen, the iconic singer who is as revered in Poland as Elvis is in the United States.<br/></p>
<p>Over the years I have created over three hundred analog video tapes in several different formats, the most popular being 8mm, Betamax SP and ¾” SP and non-SP. To hire professionals to digitize these tapes costs over $100 per hour not including transportation costs, if the playback equipment to do the job is even available. What’s worse, the tapes themselves are fragile and will eventually deteriorate. My early tapes are getting close to their expiration date, so I am in a race with time to digitize the archive before it is lost forever. <br/></p>
<p>Transferring this treasure trove of analog material to digital media will also make it accessible to new generations of viewers, researchers and art historians. My ultimate goal is to set up a digital database that includes metadata that can be shared with museums, libraries and other institutions worldwide.<br/></p>
<br/>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Rewards for Donors</b><br/></p>

Donors will receive valuable premiums: signed
DVDs of video and multi-media work or signed and numbered digital prints. Some
of the larger pieces will be printed on canvas; each uniquely altered with
acrylic paint and signed.</div><div>

<p>You can also help by sharing this with friends, acquaintances and with anyone who is a fan of cutting-edge digital artwork. Thank you!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Irina Popova. I've been a photographer for now more than 11 years.  Being a photographer means in my case - being a vagabond with a camera, and direct the whole life into the continuous search of visual stories. I am day and night taking and processing images, and now my photo archives contain more than 1 million photos. </p>
<p>For this book I decided to put together all my photographic and personal experiences and to search for my background: where I come from and what roots connect me to the ground, wherever I go. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>More info about the book:</h3>
<p>It is a book into which I put there all my soul, all my experiences, all my past and present. It's about me being a Russian - and trying to understand what means to carry a motherland within yourself. It consists of the photos from my photo archives from more than 10 years of being a photographer, travelling all over the country and basically taking photos whenever I can. It was a life transformed into the surface of the images. The text which accompany the book are the personal memories, sometimes funny, sometimes traumatic, but the ones which reflect the connection with the land – the experiences which form our souls. In the course of the work I understood that there is no such a thing as ideological, official patriotism. There are only those small personal things which form our identity. The interior of the kitchen in the parent’s house. The drunken man on the street whom you help to stand up and who tells you nice words.</p>
<ul><li>The book is called “If you have a  Secret”. There is a continuation of this phrase -  ""Go far away and hide it under the ground”. The concept is based on the children’s game where you hide a treasure under the glass and bury it – in order to rediscover it on the next day… or many years later.<br/>In the second part of the project I decided to return to my “Secrets” and to revise them. To rediscover my connection with my land – after more than 7 years of living abroad, I will revisit Russia and find, if that modern, changed country resonates with my soul and something Russian in me.<br/>The design of the book will play with half-pages, folded pages, and texts hidden in between, in order to create a meta-photography, a storytelling in several layers.</li></ul>

</div><div><br/></div></div>","Earth Unforgettable - The Story
Samuel, a gifted artist and dedicated student headed to college last year to pursue his dream of earning a degree in architecture, a huge accomplishment from someone of his economic background. However, due to economic constraints he was forced to drop out after completing a very successful first semester. 

The son of a fisherman from a humble town on the northern coast of Peru, where the average family lives far below the poverty line, Samuel sees these obstacles as challenges rather than hardships. He is more determined than ever to return to school and has identified an opportunity to begin a small business using his artistic skills. 

Earth Unforgettable was born when Samuel's uncle suggested that he paint t-shirts using special wash resistant paint. The town where he lives receives surf tourism and there are very few opportunities for tourists to buy something unique, locally made, and easy to carry home. Although Samuel has been selling his art for the last few years to tourists, it is often difficult for them to travel with the stunning paintings done on drift wood and greatly reduces the demand. By painting on t-shirts he fills a gap in the market and his pilot study, selling his hand painted t-shirts, was wildly successful. 
He is ready to become a serious entrepreneur supporting himself and enabling him to return to school.  Your donation will not only help Samuel get his business off the ground, but will enable him to get back into school and end the cycle of poverty. If you are unable to donate at this time, you can still help by sharing the video and campaign with friends and family!
About the Shirts

Each of us is familiar with a situation when a desire of having a cup of tea, coffee or hot bouillon turns into unpleasant feelings for us as the drink turns out to be very hot and in a number of cases we can even gravely burn our oral cavity or hurt the tooth enamel, that will lead us or our children to an appointment to the doctor and useless spending of money, but frequently too cold drink won't give us pleasure either.What to do, how to get something you really want? Repeatedly getting in such a situation, I thought that it would be quite good to have a mug that shows the temperature of drinks, but coming around into some shops I couldn't meet my wishes. Everything aforesaid led me to a thought that such a thing could be in demand by people and become a good business for me. Turning over different varients of how it can be done, I came to something I would like to present to you.



For each drink there is its individual temperature, under which it should be drunk to be able to taste it thoroughly. For instance, an optimal temperature of coffee or tea is 50-60 degrees Celsium.This mug will be especially useful for people with highly sensitive teeth. Moreover the scale that shows temperature will be easy to understand for children.
A special scale is put on a ceramic cup to enable to define temperature without using any data unit or any electronics.Due to it the mug doesn't differ in exploiting from an ordinary one.

How it works

We use special thermochromic paint that react on particular temperatures. Each of the six values of the temperature Fahrenheit or Celsium correspond with the colours of indication.

<p>You <i>can</i> effect
change, you <i>can</i> bring people
together, you <i>can</i> send a message even
when battling the oppression of not being allowed to use your words freely. We
hope to deliver with this story a moment of transcendence from the concrete, political now that we are constantly bombarded with and wrapped up in.  To convey a message that begins in the
depths, so deep that it cannot be touched, and thus any politics will be
masked, disguised by ideology, by abstraction, from the prodding eyes of
notorious Chinese censorship. The themes are global, the themes are personal,
Jackie is in all of us. She speaks to those of us behind the project as our
personal heroine, not for any heroic act but for her quiet suffering. We see in
this work an opportunity to touch people, the members of our Chinese
audience, with something that from the outside would appear so seemingly
foreign, but with a specific and local interpretation we transform the cultural
barriers from solid to gas, the alchemists of team Jackie.  We<b>
open our doors for free</b> to those who will take the time to sit and listen
to the quiet tirade that pours out of our character. We want to create an
exchange. We do not make a cultural product for consumption. We aim to begin a discussion.
Those who come and see, we trust them to let this stream of consciousness wash
over them, wash into them, and with the introspection we hope to stir perhaps
there will come something, dare we say some answer, creatively and
spontaneously achieved for the endless conflicts of the concrete, political
now. We trust them, and we trust you, to help us in our project, to make our
art real and available and to reify Jackie in Beijing this coming September.</p>

change, you can bring people
together, you can send a message even
when battling the oppression of not being allowed to use your words freely. We
hope to deliver with this story a moment of transcendence from the concrete, political now that we are constantly bombarded with and wrapped up in.  To convey a message that begins in the
depths, so deep that it cannot be touched, and thus any politics will be
masked, disguised by ideology, by abstraction, from the prodding eyes of
notorious Chinese censorship. The themes are global, the themes are personal,
Jackie is in all of us. She speaks to those of us behind the project as our
personal heroine, not for any heroic act but for her quiet suffering. We see in
this work an opportunity to touch people, the members of our Chinese
audience, with something that from the outside would appear so seemingly
foreign, but with a specific and local interpretation we transform the cultural
barriers from solid to gas, the alchemists of team Jackie.  We
open our doors for free to those who will take the time to sit and listen
to the quiet tirade that pours out of our character. We want to create an
exchange. We do not make a cultural product for consumption. We aim to begin a discussion.
Those who come and see, we trust them to let this stream of consciousness wash
over them, wash into them, and with the introspection we hope to stir perhaps
there will come something, dare we say some answer, creatively and
spontaneously achieved for the endless conflicts of the concrete, political
now. We trust them, and we trust you, to help us in our project, to make our
art real and available and to reify Jackie in Beijing this coming September.
Yours truly,

<h3>What project, boss?</h3>
<p>I'm Sean M Posey, and I love to take crazy pictures. Right now, I am contemplating six dastardly murders, but to make this project possible, I need your help.<br/><br/>If you choose to support me, you won’t be asked to move any bodies. You won’t be charged as an accessory to murder. Instead, you’ll help me launch a photography show about murderers, their psychology, and our perceptions of these two things.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>The Real McCoy</h3>
<p>A little background about myself first. I attended Florida Atlantic University for theater before leaving (at the advice of my professor) to go pursue a career in the arts. Unfortunately I was sidetracked. Life tends to do that to you sometimes.<br/><br/> I have spent a good portion of my adult life working various skilled labor jobs.  Five years ago, I realized I had been neglecting the artist in me, and so I dove right back in. This time, instead of acting, I now have a camera in my hand.<br/><br/> Over the last three years, I have worked on and off with many art shows. I've had seven shows with one or two other artists, I've been involved in hanging and marketing for these shows as well. For three years running, I have been an integral participant in the St. Louis Naughti Gras Erotic Arts Show, arranging the works and hanging many of the pieces in those shows.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Guys and Dolls</h3>
<p>Six murderers will each have three photos associated with them.<br/><br/> The first photo, which you have already seen, is simply a portrait taken of that person before the murder has taken place.<br/><br/> The second photograph is an artist’s representation of the killer, taken mere moments after the murder has occurred.  This second image contains enough information to connect the murder with the crime, but it offers little insight into the murderer’s motive.<br/><br/> If you want to try to understand the murderer, you must study the third and final picture in each series. In this photograph, you will find important evidence which reveals the innermost character of a murderer.<br/><br/> And this is truly the purpose of the show. I ask viewers to question their perceptions. What motives would bring one human being to end the life of another?<br/><br/> I would like to challenge you, as you view the first half of the show, to guess the character of our various persons, the methods by which they performed their first murder, and finally, what drove each of them to this most vicious of crimes.<br/><br/> While you walk through the exhibit, read everything. Consider all parts of each piece of art; every choice is  intentional. There are no accidents in art, and I will provide you with plenty of clues about the motive of each murderer.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Why's this the cat's pajamas?</h3>
<p>This project, which I call “THE MOTIVE,” will be my first solo show.<br/><br/> This is a project that was born of a love for art and photography. More importantly, it’s based on a love of detective stories in popular culture.  I want the show to put the attendees in the shoes of the detectives, while also making it an entertaining experience to participate in art.  I hope to share my love of the game and cultural phenomenon.<br/><br/> At first glance, ""THE MOTIVE"" could easily be dismissed as a gimmick, using shock and visual cliches to elicit a response from the viewer.  But the intent of these pieces is actually to challenge our societal views on art, pop media, psychology, and crime.<br/><br/> Unlike other art shows, there is a motive for viewing these photographs, aside from appreciating their particular merits as art.  I want viewers to think about the people in the photographs, fictional though they may be, and use that as a mirror to consider them as real people and how they would behave.<br/><br/> I have always had a fascination with murder, although not in a sense that I feel compelled to commit one.  No, I'm far more interested in what would drive someone to kill another human being.  I grew up feeding on pop culture: reading comic books and scary true-crime novels, watching cop shows, and seeing movies about serial killers.<br/><br/> That's precisely what this show is about: pop culture, comic books, and the motives behind killings.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>The nuts and bolts, senator.</h3>
<p>All of the 19 photographs have already been shot.  Many elements can be seen throughout the video, tiny pieces of each photograph showing a glimpse of what I have hidden behind the curtain.<br/><br/> As many of you know, photographic prints are very expensive as are the frames and the matboard and all of the other bits that go into hanging art.  And I can't afford to do this project on my own.  <br/><br/> Your pledges will go towards prints, frames, materials for the show itself (refreshments, snacks, etc.), and finally a tiny bit will go to the time it is going to take me to mount and hang this show.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Where's the jewels, Charlie?</h3>
<p>If you pledge to this project, I have a crazy list of rewards to choose from, including:<br/><br/>     Signed prints;<br/><br/>     A compiled book of the project; and<br/><br/>     A sneak peek tour of the show with the Butler.<br/><br/> So, please check out the full list of awesome pledge levels.

I'm Sean M Posey, and I love to take crazy pictures. Right now, I am contemplating six dastardly murders, but to make this project possible, I need your help.If you choose to support me, you won’t be asked to move any bodies. You won’t be charged as an accessory to murder. Instead, you’ll help me launch a photography show about murderers, their psychology, and our perceptions of these two things.
The Real McCoy
A little background about myself first. I attended Florida Atlantic University for theater before leaving (at the advice of my professor) to go pursue a career in the arts. Unfortunately I was sidetracked. Life tends to do that to you sometimes. I have spent a good portion of my adult life working various skilled labor jobs.  Five years ago, I realized I had been neglecting the artist in me, and so I dove right back in. This time, instead of acting, I now have a camera in my hand. Over the last three years, I have worked on and off with many art shows. I've had seven shows with one or two other artists, I've been involved in hanging and marketing for these shows as well. For three years running, I have been an integral participant in the St. Louis Naughti Gras Erotic Arts Show, arranging the works and hanging many of the pieces in those shows.
Guys and Dolls
Six murderers will each have three photos associated with them. The first photo, which you have already seen, is simply a portrait taken of that person before the murder has taken place. The second photograph is an artist’s representation of the killer, taken mere moments after the murder has occurred.  This second image contains enough information to connect the murder with the crime, but it offers little insight into the murderer’s motive. If you want to try to understand the murderer, you must study the third and final picture in each series. In this photograph, you will find important evidence which reveals the innermost character of a murderer. And this is truly the purpose of the show. I ask viewers to question their perceptions. What motives would bring one human being to end the life of another? I would like to challenge you, as you view the first half of the show, to guess the character of our various persons, the methods by which they performed their first murder, and finally, what drove each of them to this most vicious of crimes. While you walk through the exhibit, read everything. Consider all parts of each piece of art; every choice is  intentional. There are no accidents in art, and I will provide you with plenty of clues about the motive of each murderer.
Why's this the cat's pajamas?
This project, which I call “THE MOTIVE,” will be my first solo show. This is a project that was born of a love for art and photography. More importantly, it’s based on a love of detective stories in popular culture.  I want the show to put the attendees in the shoes of the detectives, while also making it an entertaining experience to participate in art.  I hope to share my love of the game and cultural phenomenon. At first glance, ""THE MOTIVE"" could easily be dismissed as a gimmick, using shock and visual cliches to elicit a response from the viewer.  But the intent of these pieces is actually to challenge our societal views on art, pop media, psychology, and crime. Unlike other art shows, there is a motive for viewing these photographs, aside from appreciating their particular merits as art.  I want viewers to think about the people in the photographs, fictional though they may be, and use that as a mirror to consider them as real people and how they would behave. I have always had a fascination with murder, although not in a sense that I feel compelled to commit one.  No, I'm far more interested in what would drive someone to kill another human being.  I grew up feeding on pop culture: reading comic books and scary true-crime novels, watching cop shows, and seeing movies about serial killers. That's precisely what this show is about: pop culture, comic books, and the motives behind killings.
The nuts and bolts, senator.
All of the 19 photographs have already been shot.  Many elements can be seen throughout the video, tiny pieces of each photograph showing a glimpse of what I have hidden behind the curtain. As many of you know, photographic prints are very expensive as are the frames and the matboard and all of the other bits that go into hanging art.  And I can't afford to do this project on my own.   Your pledges will go towards prints, frames, materials for the show itself (refreshments, snacks, etc.), and finally a tiny bit will go to the time it is going to take me to mount and hang this show.
Where's the jewels, Charlie?
If you pledge to this project, I have a crazy list of rewards to choose from, including:     Signed prints;     A compiled book of the project; and     A sneak peek tour of the show with the Butler. So, please check out the full list of awesome pledge levels. You’ll find them in the column on the right.
Leave a note in the dead drop.
Progress updates will be as often as I have news to report.  Within three days of reaching the goal, I will place the order for the prints and start the process of shipping out the pledge rewards.   Within 5 days I'll begin shopping for a venue.  I already have one gallery dying to display this work, and I have a couple of other places that are showing some interest.    I plan to have this show up and running by the beginning of November.

<p>To help my family financially I started selling my art online again (I have been doing that on and off for the last 13 years). However, back in March of this year I ran across a great artist community trying to revitalize a dying mall here in Dallas. I took some of our savings and rented a 3,000 sqft shop at such a great price I just couldn't pass it up. </p>
<p>Since I opened the community has grown by leaps and bounds! We now have 1/3+ of the mall inhabited by galleries and studios and have brought life back into the building with art walks, 1-2 charity auctions a month, and some great events featuring art, music and entertainment. My shop has also grown, each month I am able to take some of the money my studio makes and re-invest it into more products for my store/gallery. It has been slow going, only adding a handful of one type new product per month featuring my art on it. In addition to my original art I am now able to offer:</p>

I have done all of this with my children (now 2.5 and 7 years old) at my side! This has been a dream of mine for so long that I am so excited and blessed to have been able to do this. And my two boys just LOVE the experience of meeting with customers, creating art of their own and working in the same building as so many other great artists!</p>

<h3><strong>What is STL Improv Anywhere? </strong></h3>
<p>STL Improv Anywhere is a site-specific performance art troupe that brings spontaneity and creativity to public spaces of St. Louis, MO. Through large participatory events and guerilla performances, STL IA creates opportunities for citizens to engage more meaningfully with each other and with the shared spaces of their city. We have created over <em>35 performances/events in the past two years, </em>including the <a href=""http://www.riverfronttimes.com/slideshow/no-pants-subway-ride-st-louis-2012-35942562/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">No Pants Metrolink Ride</a>, <a href=""http://www.ksdk.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=314649"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pillow Fight Day</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTbdzTjTlD8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">performances throughout the Grove</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.383064251734651.81745.167594436614968&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cherokee Street</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.505032422871166.106226.167594436614968&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Downtown</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.330077783699965.72506.167594436614968&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Clayton</a>, and numerous other spaces throughout St. Louis. Our work invites spectators to become active participants.

<p>When performing, STL IA blurs the line between reality and performance: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.167600359947709.29680.167594436614968&amp;type=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>Am I actually </em></a><em><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.167600359947709.29680.167594436614968&amp;type=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">getting arrested</a>? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK81tev2-A4&amp;feature=player_embedded"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Is that person’s mustache real? </a></em>In this way, we blend life and art. It is hard to tell when your ‘regular day’ ended and your magical one began. By blurring these lines and placing art in the context of the everyday, we hope to suggest that there is in fact no difference between the mundane and the magical, that the city is special and that its inhabitants are capable of making it interesting.</p>

<p>STL Improv Anywhere is comprised of a growing collective of St. Louisans that love their city and want to be more involved in its evolution. They are risk-takers, often with no performance background but a desire to do something they’ve never done before, and a fervent love for their city.</p>

<h3><strong>How did this begin?</strong></h3>
<p>Director Mallory Nezam moved back from Europe in 2010 and noticed that public spaces in St. Louis were quiet. Determined to activate the spaces of a re-emerging city that she believed in, she gathered a crew of 4 friends to participate in an art event to test out the idea. What started as a one-time project spread like chicken pox in a preschool. Two years and 35 performances later, STL Improv Anywhere is still going strong because we are providing a service to the city that no one else is. Countless spontaneous participants give positive affirmation of our potential to challenge typical conceptions of public space and modes of interaction.</p>

<h3><strong>Why we need your financial support.</strong></h3>
<p>The inertia is here. We want to use it for bigger and better things. As city-wide events continue to rise in participation, more funding and volunteer efforts are needed. Funding will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Renting office space at Nebula Coworking on Cherokee Street</li>
<li>Producing more frequent, large participatory events like the No Pants Metrolink Ride &amp; Pillow Fight Day</li>
<li>Creating a new website that is more user-friendly</li>
<li>Promotional material to get the word out about our amazing events</li>
<li>Purchasing our own video camera and editing software to become more self-sufficient and supply you with entertaining videos and coverage of our performances/events</li>
<li>Branding/identity development, including STL Improv Anywhere fan merchandise</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to host larger events more frequently, and to reach out to include more St. Louisans. In the end, we are doing this for our city – to build a more interesting and engaged populace, to empower citizens to become creators and to further define creative experience. We are asking for funding to make our awesome city even more interesting, lively and active.</p>

<h3>What it is.</h3>
<p>The Tesla bill, is an art project designed to commemorate one of the greatest scientists of all time, with the proceeds going to help fund research being conducted by a local community of amateur scientists, by providing them with a space to work from and resources to work with. What this means is that the facility will be publicly accessible to anyone who wants to conduct research or needs access to tooling and such for building parts for an experiment</p>
<ul>
<li>Who am I? Many know me as the Architect, or as the primary designer and artist behind many of the items created at Borg Steam Factory.</li>

</ul>
<p>I believe this project is important because every day we forget that Tesla has a legacy, even though he had no biological heirs, as his way of seeing the universe and approaching science has indeed effected us, as well as nearly every scientist that has ever been since his time. This bill I hope will remind us of this fact, and fund future scientists, creating a wave of thinking that will further persuade people to fund those working to make the world a better place.</p>
Your donations will both help fund a local research facility and work space (see here: <a href=""http://www.voxelblock.com/page2.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.voxelblock.com/page2.html</a> ) that will offer space to work on research and send further help to other similar workshops and hacker/maker spaces around the globe, as well as help me to secure the resources to produce an incredible piece that has both an artistic presence, and is made with a very high quality standard, for instance</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>1. I will need resources for making custom paper</p>
<p>the reasons for this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper will be resistant to the chemicals in counterfeit pens, to allow you to verify that they are indeed genuine.</li>
<li>Paper will have fibers through out, colors of the fibers will match an over all Tesla based color scheme.</li>
<li>Paper will have a strip inside reading ""just say no to greed"".</li>
<li>Paper will have proper watermarks.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>***NEW*** each bill will have an extra layer of protecting the authenticity of the unit, not only will they have individual serial numbers, but to transfer ownership we will keep your original email address on hand as the owner, on a separate off line computer with the serial numbers of the bills you have purchased, and if you opt to, will also include a password you will need to call in and give us, that will be needed to transfer ownership of the bill with that serial number. This will be used in the event of theft, to allow easier replacement as we will issue a new bill with new serial number and mark the stolen one in our database, in case anyone comes forward with information on it's whereabouts. The cost for replacement too will be only the shipping required to get your new bill to you, so the cost of obtaining the first one sort of includes a pretty good insurance against theft as well, and this will be for the life time of myself, and anyone who takes over the project. </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TL:DR of the above is that to transfer the bill you will need to write us FROM the email we have on record and give us the new recipients email to change our records, and if you added the password, call us to confirm with that password, that you are transferring the bill ownership to the new person. Then it will be their responsibility to call and set up a password for their ownership if they choose to take advantage of that option.</strong></li>
<li>additionally if you call with a serial number and a name we can confirm if the owner is indeed the owner of a bill before you purchase it, or trade for it.<strong><br/></strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. I will need to make custom metal press plates. This requires a number of steps to create a lasting image in a metal that will endure many pressings to ensure everyone wanting to have one of these bills, will get this opportunity.</p>
<p>and lastly</p>
<p>3. Custom ink. This will be made to have a lasting effect on the paper, not smear, and be extremely fade resistant. I will need 3 distinct colors, one for the front, one for the back, and one for the custom seals and serial numbers, (yes each bill will have it's own serial number identifying it and when it was printed up.)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How you can help.</h3>
<p>In addition to donating, and spreading the word by sharing our project you will also be able to give your input on the project's development as it is progressing (if you wish. No one will twist your arm :) ).<br/><br/>to keep up, I will do updates with photo progress of the project, and ask questions, run polls and such on design and color schemes, additionally, I will send emails to those who wish to have them, and you can reply via these emails with your thoughts. If it turns out to be a popular idea, I will set up a forum for people to discuss this as well.</p>
<p>the first issue will be to discuss what the denomination is for, so far I am for using time, and designating this bill as the hour. What are your thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>For those wishing to see other examples of my work:</strong></p>
<p>The above image is a collage of one of my pieces and the image of Tesla I intend to use.

The Tesla bill, is an art project designed to commemorate one of the greatest scientists of all time, with the proceeds going to help fund research being conducted by a local community of amateur scientists, by providing them with a space to work from and resources to work with. What this means is that the facility will be publicly accessible to anyone who wants to conduct research or needs access to tooling and such for building parts for an experiment

Who am I? Many know me as the Architect, or as the primary designer and artist behind many of the items created at Borg Steam Factory.

Have ideas for research projects you'd like to see? Want to help with art, marketing, or other practical ways to help us succeed? Are you a scientist with a great idea, but no workspace?(you can contact me directly via www.borgsteamfactory.com/contact.html)and GET INVOLVED

I believe this project is important because every day we forget that Tesla has a legacy, even though he had no biological heirs, as his way of seeing the universe and approaching science has indeed effected us, as well as nearly every scientist that has ever been since his time. This bill I hope will remind us of this fact, and fund future scientists, creating a wave of thinking that will further persuade people to fund those working to make the world a better place.
Your donations will both help fund a local research facility and work space (see here: http://www.voxelblock.com/page2.html ) that will offer space to work on research and send further help to other similar workshops and hacker/maker spaces around the globe, as well as help me to secure the resources to produce an incredible piece that has both an artistic presence, and is made with a very high quality standard, for instance

What We Need & What You Get
1. I will need resources for making custom paper
the reasons for this are:

Paper will be resistant to the chemicals in counterfeit pens, to allow you to verify that they are indeed genuine.
Paper will have fibers through out, colors of the fibers will match an over all Tesla based color scheme.
Paper will have a strip inside reading ""just say no to greed"".
Paper will have proper watermarks.

***NEW*** each bill will have an extra layer of protecting the authenticity of the unit, not only will they have individual serial numbers, but to transfer ownership we will keep your original email address on hand as the owner, on a separate off line computer with the serial numbers of the bills you have purchased, and if you opt to, will also include a password you will need to call in and give us, that will be needed to transfer ownership of the bill with that serial number. This will be used in the event of theft, to allow easier replacement as we will issue a new bill with new serial number and mark the stolen one in our database, in case anyone comes forward with information on it's whereabouts. The cost for replacement too will be only the shipping required to get your new bill to you, so the cost of obtaining the first one sort of includes a pretty good insurance against theft as well, and this will be for the life time of myself, and anyone who takes over the project. 

TL:DR of the above is that to transfer the bill you will need to write us FROM the email we have on record and give us the new recipients email to change our records, and if you added the password, call us to confirm with that password, that you are transferring the bill ownership to the new person. Then it will be their responsibility to call and set up a password for their ownership if they choose to take advantage of that option.
additionally if you call with a serial number and a name we can confirm if the owner is indeed the owner of a bill before you purchase it, or trade for it.


2. I will need to make custom metal press plates. This requires a number of steps to create a lasting image in a metal that will endure many pressings to ensure everyone wanting to have one of these bills, will get this opportunity.
and lastly
3. Custom ink. This will be made to have a lasting effect on the paper, not smear, and be extremely fade resistant. I will need 3 distinct colors, one for the front, one for the back, and one for the custom seals and serial numbers, (yes each bill will have it's own serial number identifying it and when it was printed up.)


How you can help.
In addition to donating, and spreading the word by sharing our project you will also be able to give your input on the project's development as it is progressing (if you wish. No one will twist your arm :) ).to keep up, I will do updates with photo progress of the project, and ask questions, run polls and such on design and color schemes, additionally, I will send emails to those who wish to have them, and you can reply via these emails with your thoughts. If it turns out to be a popular idea, I will set up a forum for people to discuss this as well.
the first issue will be to discuss what the denomination is for, so far I am for using time, and designating this bill as the hour. What are your thoughts?
For those wishing to see other examples of my work:

SF school scrambles to restore obliterated mural

Updated 11:52 a.m., Monday, June 25, 2012


Less than a month after San Francisco middle school students put finishing touches on a brightly colored mural that took the better part of two years to plan, draw and paint, district workers followed orders to cover it up with a coat of yellow primer.
Only after the images of the Golden Gate Bridge, the school's fire-breathing dragon mascot and 200 feet of monkeys, yellow fish, blue waves and the city's polychromatic skyline were virtually obliterated did anyone realize the summer-break work order was a terrible mistake.
""A mural is a lot of work. Keeping kids focused on it is a lot of motivation,"" said Megan McMahon, the Buena Vista Horace Mann K-8 school art teacher who coordinated the project.
She received a text message on June 14 saying all the effort had been wiped out with a quick coat of paint.
""My stomach just dropped,"" she said. ""It was like a year and half worth of work.""
The problems started earlier in the school year when parents participated in a committee to address maintenance issues at the school.
They decided that the entire building and adjacent walls needed a fresh coat of paint, including several murals that were falling apart or had been painted by a church group that had previously used the Mission District building.
They didn't know the long mural along the base of the Bartlett Street wall below a chain-link fence was new and created by current students. Administrators who approved the request were also unaware of the mural's importance.
When all the parties involved found out, they were devastated, district spokeswoman Gentle Blythe said in an e-mail explaining the mural's misfortune.
""Once they realized that this mural was new and the teacher who worked on it was understandably upset, the parents who were involved in the facilities committee were very apologetic,"" she said.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>What if the only thing you had to do to fund outstanding arts education in your community was have a beer at your local bar?</span></p>
<p>The Art Bar and Theater is an innovative food, art, and performance venue designed to escape traditional funding models for the arts, train artists in successful entrepreneurship, and fund arts education in local communities – all while serving up great beer, tasty food, and an eclectic range of art.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/74538723"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If this campaign succeeds, the Art Bar will be able to open doors on a brick and mortar location within the year, adding to the growing “philanthro-pub” movement across the country. Philanthropubs such as United Libations in SF, The Oregon Public House in Portland, and CAUSE DC in Washington DC are already successfully showing that pub sales can change the world as they donate 100% of their profits to worthy organizations. </span><br/></p>
<p>The Art Bar takes that model one step further. The artists who work behind the bar create diverse arts programming for the venue AND provide free arts education and outreach to the local community – all funded by your purchase of that beer, sandwich or coffee you were going to buy anyway. We’re helping to solve the arts funding and education crisis – one pint at a time. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span><br/></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/73266807"" title=""The Art Bar"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Get When You Support Us</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p></span><p><span>The perks we’re offering showcase some of our work as artists – think of it as a preview of the kind of programming we’ll be able to make available both at the Art Bar itself and in local schools and the community at large. </span></p>
<p>Kevin, the director of the project, is a writer with both an MFA in poetry and a heck of a lot of street cred. He’s known locally for his street poetry, as you can see in the video below.

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>What else do you get when you fund an Art Bar?</p>
<p>You get an outstanding arts venue staffed by a team of poets, artists, and musicians who have a combined 50 years of restaurant experience between them. </p>
<p>You get an innovative funding model for the arts that takes one thing you probably already want – beer – and uses it to fund another thing you probably already want – great arts programming and great arts education in your community. </p>
<p>Instead of relying on ever-shrinking, ever-more-competitive grant funding to make sure your kids get meaningful access to arts education, you can now support the Art Bar and watch as the working artists pouring you a pint use your Friday night beer money to fund classes, workshops, and events in a diverse range of mediums from poetry to painting for your kids, families, and friends.</p>
<p>The Art Bar team already has a successful track record in producing superlative arts programming with a broad reach. Since March of 2013, the Art Bar Collaborators have been hosting a wide variety of arts events in a small cafe on the Tannery Arts Center property in Santa Cruz, CA. They have produced a hugely diverse range of events, from a weekly poetry show to a sold-out internet cat video film festival to dance performances by nationally renowned dance companies. Starting with a budget of zero, they have generated more than $3500 in support to local artists and brought a diverse and returning audience into a vibrant community space.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, this crew has raised the money to plan, book, and promote the shows, as well as purchasing an entire sound system for their performances and events, purely on money from poetry sales. That’s right, poetry sales. If this crew can succeed for six months on nothing but a budget based on selling poems to strangers on the street, just imagine what they could do with your funding! </p>
<p>The Art Bar could stand to provide over $10,000 in aid to schools every year via a sustainable income stream, while simultaneously providing hundreds of hours of classroom support per year in Santa Cruz alone.  In addition to providing Arts Education aid and an outstanding location for live arts events, we plan to offer entrepreneurial, music, language arts, and career building workshops to further engage the community. </p>
<p>And it’s even bigger than that. In order to provide the programming we envision, we’re planning to employ a service staff of outstanding, visionary artists and performers who aren’t just behind the bar – they’ll be producing the programming and teaching in your schools. We want these creative folks to have equally grand visions of their own, and to train them through our model to successfully implement similar models of their own. In short, the Art Bar is also an incubator, and we are actively encouraging the artists we work with to take our model and replicate it, tweak it, and perfect it elsewhere. That means our impact is multiplied -- by the number of cities interested and able to host an arts-education philanthro-pub and the number of artists we send out into the world with a new vision of what’s possible in creating artistic venues and art education.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>Our main challenge lies in successfully running The Art Bar in such a way that we turn a profit we can put to use to produce programming and outreach that supplements, rather than duplicates, existing programs in the local community. </span></p>
<p>To this end, we have cultivated relationships with the Arts Council of Santa Cruz County, as well as other county Arts Educators to connect with and augment current programming, collaborate with educator training, and avoid the duplication of available services &amp; aid. We also have a team of solid business advisers and, as mentioned, a combined 50 years of food service and restaurant experience ourselves that we’ll put to work to ensure we make sound business decisions. After all, in addition to our programming, we want to make sure that the artists we employ behind the bar are getting a great foundation in entrepreneurship and successful business  practices, so that they can go out and start their own creative, innovative, sustainable, community-based projects like The Art Bar elsewhere!</p>

What if the only thing you had to do to fund outstanding arts education in your community was have a beer at your local bar?
The Art Bar and Theater is an innovative food, art, and performance venue designed to escape traditional funding models for the arts, train artists in successful entrepreneurship, and fund arts education in local communities – all while serving up great beer, tasty food, and an eclectic range of art.

If this campaign succeeds, the Art Bar will be able to open doors on a brick and mortar location within the year, adding to the growing “philanthro-pub” movement across the country. Philanthropubs such as United Libations in SF, The Oregon Public House in Portland, and CAUSE DC in Washington DC are already successfully showing that pub sales can change the world as they donate 100% of their profits to worthy organizations. 
The Art Bar takes that model one step further. The artists who work behind the bar create diverse arts programming for the venue AND provide free arts education and outreach to the local community – all funded by your purchase of that beer, sandwich or coffee you were going to buy anyway. We’re helping to solve the arts funding and education crisis – one pint at a time. 






What You Get When You Support Us

The perks we’re offering showcase some of our work as artists – think of it as a preview of the kind of programming we’ll be able to make available both at the Art Bar itself and in local schools and the community at large. 
Kevin, the director of the project, is a writer with both an MFA in poetry and a heck of a lot of street cred. He’s known locally for his street poetry, as you can see in the video below. His short, sweet poems are local favorites for occasions from birthdays to baby showers. Backers who receive poems on a topic of their choice will be amazed by what Kevin can do from a simple prompt like “Orange” or “Thirtieth anniversary.” The books of poetry are collections of poems requested by local from his inventive “poetry cart.”

Alyssa’s book Blood Orange is a gorgeous handmade artist book of poems from another young outstanding poet. 
Jericha Senyak is a dancer and an artist with a synesthetic sensibility and a preoccupation with joy.  Her unique, intricate, assemblage-style altar boxes combine objects and vintage collage to create startling, evocative, miniature worlds.
Backers who receive a personalized beer stein can drink in the knowledge that they’ve supported an innovative arts model based on beer – and what could be more satisfying than that? Cheers!

</div><div><p><br/></p></div></div>","This is a campaign to raise $20,000 to save a 180 year old Dutch Barn and art space situated in Clinton Corners,NY,Dutchess County, Hudson Valley.

This massive structure, built without the use of nails, is held together magically by design sense and wooden pegs. Robert Hedges, barn expert and trustee for The Society for the Preservation of Hudson Valley Vernacular Architecture, estimated this barn to have been built in 1830, as being a truly unique barn, possibly described as a Swing Beam Carriage Barn. 
The hurricanes and sustained rains of this past year have had disastrous effects on the barn. It presently needs a new roof and side wall or the building will collapse.This would be a big loss, not only for its historic and architectural significance, but as a space for the creation and exhibition of contemporary art by NY artists in a beautiful rural setting. For the last seven years, I have used this barn for creating artwork (lindseybrownstudio.com) as well as for hosting art events.
In 2007 there were two group shows curated at the barn by NY gallerist Rose Burlingham (roseburlingham.com) including work by Mary Carlson, Joanne Howard, Stephen Westfall, Cora Cohen, Christopher Stackhouse, Billy Copley, Paul Baumann, Marilyn Gold, Lindsey Brown,Catherine Croner, Mary Jones, Jerome Boutterin, Sue Carlson, Judy Hudson, Gwen Hardie, Stephen Mueller, Manuel Pardo, Larry Silver, Maggie Simonelli and poetry readings by: Mary Donnelly, Susan Kinsolving and Sam Truitt.
Upon the completion of this campaign, Rose Burlingham will curate the next Barn Show in June 2012.

The goal is to make necessary repairs to keep the barn standing for another 180 years. Any money raised in this campaign, will go directly toward replacing the roof and reconstructing the side wall.

<p><strong>STORY</strong></p>
<p>His shaving brush, his books, a handful of ties, his Hugo Awards … these are amongst the things my father left behind him when he died.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This book, beautifully designed and ready to print, contains a selection from the 9,000+ images I took of all my father’s things. There is a foreword by celebrated British novelist Christopher Priest and an essay by cultural sociologist Dr. Margaret Gibson.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With more than 250 pages of full color images, including 8 fold-outs, it is at once a depiction of one person’s property, a record of design across the decades and a meditation on the extraordinary nature of ordinary things</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pictures create a portrait of the person and prompts thoughts of our own possessions, what we keep and what we dispose of.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Possessions are a universal theme. Separated from their surroundings these objects lead us to contemplate the intrinsic value of design and the singular virtues of everyday things, and to consider the importance that we attach to our own material possessions, and what will become of them after our passing.  For those who have already had to deal with the disposal of a relative’s things it will resonate with their own experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My Dad (he was my Dad as well as my father) was Brian Aldiss, one of the most important voices in science fiction, writer, poet and artist, and so some of the photos in the book reflect this; not least his awards, early science fiction magazines and many, many books. Plenty there for Science Fiction fans to enjoy. There is also all the everyday stuff of life; playing cards, soap, family snaps and tea bags. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Writer on Photography and Anthropology Elizabeth Edwards says: ""Under Wendy Aldiss' incisive eye the heightening and theatrical propensities of photography come into play. Details rise up and grab attention"".</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a junior in high school and I am starting to look for ways to learn life skills and get experience in new situations. This summer, I would like to attend two camps that I think will help me improve as an artist and a person. One of them is a fine and applied arts camp in my hometown's university. The other camp is a camp focused on helping LGBT youth build useful leadership skills.</p>
<p>To partially fund my tuition to these camps, I decided to sell art commissions. I have previously done a similar commissions campaign to fund a summer language exchange to South Korea last year, which was a very successful and formative experience for me. Donating to my campaign will get you the satisfaction of knowing you helped me experience something formative this summer, and it will also get you a personalized piece of art!</p>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>If you would like to commission a drawing from me, you can email me your idea and any pictures for reference that you might want me to use, and donate a minimum amount to my campaign (depending on what kind of drawing you commissioned). </p>
<p>I would like to reach $1500 from this campaign, but I am giving out perks starting from smaller donations. This means that if you donate 15 dollars or more, you are guaranteed to receive a personalized drawing made by me! </p>
