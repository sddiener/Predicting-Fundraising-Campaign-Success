My own studio practice is heavily influenced by Japanese traditions and is specifically focused on designing modern sculptural interpretations of Eastern temple bells. In addition to my long-time dream of traveling throughout Japan to visit temple bell sites, I have a particular interest in learning from rural potters about the Japanese wabi-sabi philosophy + the Mingei folk art movement. While in residency, I hope to immerse myself in Onishi's mountainside community, travel to Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples to continue my Bell Project research, and create a new body of work inspired by this experience. </p><h3>Why an Art Residency?</h3><p>I am honored to have been awarded a spot in the Shiro Oni Studio program for 6 weeks this summer. I will join a group of 10 international artists for a cultural exchange in the community of Onishi, a small Japanese town just 1.5 hrs north of Tokyo. Art residencies are a common practice among artists. They allow artists a dedicated time to fully engage in their work + absorb the influences from the culture they are visiting.

<h3>Art for the Future</h3>
<p>This project supports the implementation of the UNESCO Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the creation of a limited series of collectible artwork.</p>
<p>Seventeen original pieces of artwork will be designed and created, representing each of the SDGs. Like the Goals, each piece is interconnected and together make up a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>Culture has been recognized as integral to achieving the SDGs, and it is through cultural expression that each goal will be considered and brought to life on canvas. Each piece will be thoughtfully created to highlight the actions that we may take together, individually and collectively, in order to ensure a more equitable future for our communities, our economies, and our environments.</p>
<p>One of the more evocative elements of culture is its ability to connect people from all different backgrounds in order to share and express ideas about the relationships among ourselves, our communities and our built and natural environments. Cultural exchanges can also help to build trust within and among diverse communities that sustain meaningful and productive social and economic activities, and it's our intention that this project will develop trust throughout its course.</p>
<p>We’re at a pivotal moment in our world, and Art for the Future captures the spirit of this time, our collective optimism for the future, and a few ideas of what that future might look like when it arrives. Each piece represents a shared commitment to a more sustainable future.</p>
<p>Patrons can claim stewardship of one or more goals, and will have the opportunity to connect directly with the artist to give shape to the artwork. Patrons will be encouraged to share their thoughts, ideas, and hopes for heritage conservation, art, and sustainable development, which will in turn be reflected on canvas.</p>
<p>Patrons will be able to track the art project as it progresses through regular communication updates, along with entertaining news, ideas and inspiration for action that can be taken in pursuit of the goals.</p>
<p>Each limited edition piece and print is signed by the artist, and comes with a certificate of authenticity and information about the initiative. The project will take place over the summer and fall of 2021, and patrons will receive their perks well ahead of Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>The Backstory</strong></p>
<p>This project is being undertaken by the staff at Heritage Connects, a small business that works to integrate heritage conservation and sustainable development. With respect for our shared global heritage, our interdisciplinary team works in the space where theory and practice, tradition and innovation converge in order to sustain connections among people and place.</p>
<p>This year, as part of our corporate social responsibility strategy, we challenged ourselves to ‘think outside the box’ and find new ways to support sustainable activities and connect people with important cultural issues...and presto—Art for the Future was born.</p>
<p>The artwork is an expression of the exchanges among the artist, patrons and the environment in which they are produced. Each piece is a careful balancing act between what is and what could be, and reflect the tensions between the strength and fragility inherent in our culture and environment. The art serves to translate policy into action and in doing so mediates the landscape between theory and practice, the realm of the ideal and the more pragmatic world.

<p><strong>Art for the Future: a Challenge and Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>We've designed and led collaborative initiatives before. We also have over twenty years' experience creating artwork. What's new and exciting for us is to bring both of these activities together. We're excited to use a new way connect and collaborate with stakeholders that creates meaningful dialogue about policy. Artistically, the project represents a challenge to translate an exchange of perspectives through the medium of canvas and acrylic.  </p>
<p>While the current socio-economic conditions have made living and working a little more challenging these days, we see this as wonderful incentive to take on this initiative--if not now, then when? This project offers a unique opportunity to capture the spirit of the times as we re-consider and re-affirm our common global humanity.</p>

This project supports the implementation of the UNESCO Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the creation of a limited series of collectible artwork.
Seventeen original pieces of artwork will be designed and created, representing each of the SDGs. Like the Goals, each piece is interconnected and together make up a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.
Culture has been recognized as integral to achieving the SDGs, and it is through cultural expression that each goal will be considered and brought to life on canvas. Each piece will be thoughtfully created to highlight the actions that we may take together, individually and collectively, in order to ensure a more equitable future for our communities, our economies, and our environments.
One of the more evocative elements of culture is its ability to connect people from all different backgrounds in order to share and express ideas about the relationships among ourselves, our communities and our built and natural environments. Cultural exchanges can also help to build trust within and among diverse communities that sustain meaningful and productive social and economic activities, and it's our intention that this project will develop trust throughout its course.
We’re at a pivotal moment in our world, and Art for the Future captures the spirit of this time, our collective optimism for the future, and a few ideas of what that future might look like when it arrives. Each piece represents a shared commitment to a more sustainable future.
Patrons can claim stewardship of one or more goals, and will have the opportunity to connect directly with the artist to give shape to the artwork. Patrons will be encouraged to share their thoughts, ideas, and hopes for heritage conservation, art, and sustainable development, which will in turn be reflected on canvas.
Patrons will be able to track the art project as it progresses through regular communication updates, along with entertaining news, ideas and inspiration for action that can be taken in pursuit of the goals.
Each limited edition piece and print is signed by the artist, and comes with a certificate of authenticity and information about the initiative. The project will take place over the summer and fall of 2021, and patrons will receive their perks well ahead of Christmas.
The Backstory
This project is being undertaken by the staff at Heritage Connects, a small business that works to integrate heritage conservation and sustainable development. With respect for our shared global heritage, our interdisciplinary team works in the space where theory and practice, tradition and innovation converge in order to sustain connections among people and place.
This year, as part of our corporate social responsibility strategy, we challenged ourselves to ‘think outside the box’ and find new ways to support sustainable activities and connect people with important cultural issues...and presto—Art for the Future was born.
The artwork is an expression of the exchanges among the artist, patrons and the environment in which they are produced. Each piece is a careful balancing act between what is and what could be, and reflect the tensions between the strength and fragility inherent in our culture and environment. The art serves to translate policy into action and in doing so mediates the landscape between theory and practice, the realm of the ideal and the more pragmatic world. Each piece expresses hope and ambition: each traces a journey of the ideas that change our world, and the complex process of the sublimation of these ideas into the tangible and material. This is Art for the Future.
Art for Impact
Building creative capacity: We are planning to raise $50,000+. This funding will cover project expenses that include materials, shipping, and crowd-funding platform fees. Any profit over and above this will be used to support the evolution of Heritage Connects as it grows from a part-time idea into a full-time non-profit social enterprise. We have other conservation projects in the development stage that we're looking forward to sharing, and Art for the Future represents a step forward down this path.
The power of cultural exchange: Our patrons are co-drivers on this project! You have the opportunity to take stewardship of one or more of the sustainable development goals and directly shape the art that is produced.
Sustainable development on canvas: Patrons and backers will enjoy the fruits of artistic labours through a unique, one-of-a-kind limited edition original artwork that is suitable for framing. This could sit in a place of pride on your wall, and also makes for a meaningful  personal or CSR-friendly corporate gift.
Leveraging inspiration: the collectible postcards and sticker sets featuring each of the seventeen artworks can be used to help spread the word. Spark a conversation with your friends and family. Counter apathy with action and share your ideas about what a more sustainable future could look like, a story, or your favourite recipe. 
From ideas to action: The project supports SDGs 8, 11, 12 and 17. We'll use sustainable materials, and support local businesses and those with corporate social responsibility strategies that consider sustainable development through our activities. 
We thank you in advance for your support. On the off chance we don't reach our entire goal, we'll use the existing funds to continue the project with a more limited scope. Cultural expressions are resilient and persistent: Art for the Future embodies this spirit!

</h2>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span>Hello! My name is Sydney Bernard, I am 17 years old and I am a contortionist. <br/>Originally I am from Berkeley CA, but my mom and I moved to Los Angeles about 3 years ago to escape an abusive household. The move was really difficult for me to adjust to. I struggled making friends in all my new schools, and constantly worried for my family that I had to leave behind. Things were seeming pretty grim... And thats when I happened to stumbled upon Kinetic Theory Theatre, a circus school for aspiring artists. From the moment I entered Kinetic Theory I knew it was the light at the end of the tunnel. <br/>As a former gymnast, I had always been interested in circus-specifically contortion, however my coaches and peers had often told me I would not be able to pursue it because I was not born naturally flexible. Much to my suprise, my coaches at Kinetic Theory were all extremely supportive and so I began training 7hrs a week. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span>It wasn't until my first performance at KT where I discovered my passion for the stage. The feeling I get when I'm performing is immeasurable. I feel so free and happy. Discovering circus and performance was the best thing that has ever happened to me. It is not only a positive outlet for me to express myself, but it has been a way for me to overcome things that I have been through and grow as a person. I cannot change my unfortunate past, but I can work to sculpt a bright and successful future for myself.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span>After a while, I was invited to join Kinetic Theory's Pre-Professional Troupe. The troupe trains 9hrs a week, primarily focusing on their main discipline, but also working on acrobatics, dance, and theatre. They perform three full length shows a year, and also perform at gigs and events around Los Angeles. I felt so lucky to be invited into such an incredible program with such talented people. My troupe felt like the happy loving family I had never had. I could feel safe with them.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span>It was around this time that I started to become close with my coach, and Kinetic Theory's owner/director Stephanie Abrams. When I first met her I had no idea what a huge part of my life she'd become. I am so grateful I met her. She is so generous and hardworking, and she continues to be an inspiration for me each day.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span>Stephanie accepted me as her apprentice. I now have a scholarship to train 25hours a week. I perform gigs around Los Angeles and at the end of this year I plan on launching my professional career. <br/><br/>My new act that I have developed is a performance art piece. I have combined my passion for art and painting with my passion for contortion and performance. As I continue to get more advanced, more oppurtunities are arising for me. This summer my troupe will be travelling to China for a Circus Cultural Exchange. We will be training and performing for 2weeks at several circus schools all over the country. Then in January, I am auditioning for the annual Cirque De Demain festival in Paris, France. My mentor and I have decided, that regardless of if I am accepted into the festival or not, we will still go to France to promote my new act. I am so grateful for these wonderful opportunities that have opened up for me, however the one thing that's holding me back from pursuing them is my current financial situation. Unfortunatley my mom and I are barely making ends meet at home, and could never be able to pay for me to follow my dream.<br/>I have never been down an easy road, I have always had to work hard for the things I've wanted, but now the situation is simply beyond my control. I worry that these two incredible opportunities will only come once in my life time. Please help me follow my dreams. I appreciate any contribution, and am so grateful for the generous people in this world who will be able to help me.<br/>Thank you for listening to my story.</span></span></span></p>

<p><b>Background and Beginnings</b></p>
<p>I have spent a lot of time in the southern Appalachian region over the last 40 years and it is where my daughter, Candy, grew up. Candy passed away on July 5,2013 at the age of 39 and her passing has made me reflect on my life goals. More importantly, how we tend to set aside our goals while we do all the things that are necessary to raise our families and provide for them. This project will achieve one of my goals in life, but is also a tribute to Candy and the beauty that surrounded her through out her life.</p>
<p>The Appalachian Mountains are the oldest mountain range in North America and they hold more mystery than anywhere I have ever been. The majestic views from the peaks and the breathtaking chill of the waterfalls that dot the landscape fill the heart and soul with a sense of wonder that is overwhelming! </p>

<p>""<b>Mist On The Mountains, Southern Appalachians""</b> is a compilation of fine art images to be printed as a coffee table book. Many of the images for this book have already been produced and the remainder will be shot over the course of the next 90 days. </p>

I will be 60 at the end of this year and the time has come for me to make this dream happen.</span><br/></p>
<p>My plan includes the printing of, at least, 100 copies of the book. Of course, going over the original funding goal will increase the number of books we can produce. </p>
<p><b>Making The </b><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Commitment</b></span></p>
<p>At the end of August 2014, I closed my business and ended a nearly 4 decades long career in tattooing. I did this as a leap of faith and to force myself to devote 100% effort to making this project come to fruition. Did I make the right call? I think so. This is where my heart has led me and it is the path I have chosen to follow. I would love for you to share this journey with me as we explore the beauty of the lands and landmarks of the Southern Appalachian Mountains!</p>

<br/>
</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Travel expenses are the biggest challenge in the completion of the project. The southern portion of the Appalachian Mountains extend from southern Maryland all the way down into South Carolina. It's a lot of space to cover. Ideally, I would like to acquire a travel trailer to save on expenses like hotels, food, and maintaining a space to use my computer for editing images. I have been working on some trade deals to that end. </p>
<p>Weather is also always a consideration when it comes to outdoor photography, however, I do own an umbrella and I don't believe I would melt if I got wet. Protecting the cameras and lenses is first priority in inclement weather.</p>

""Mist On The Mountains, Southern Appalachians"" is a compilation of fine art images to be printed as a coffee table book. Many of the images for this book have already been produced and the remainder will be shot over the course of the next 90 days. 
 The death of my daughter showed me in no uncertain terms that we are not promised tomorrow, next week or next year. I will be 60 at the end of this year and the time has come for me to make this dream happen.
My plan includes the printing of, at least, 100 copies of the book. Of course, going over the original funding goal will increase the number of books we can produce. 
Making The Commitment
At the end of August 2014, I closed my business and ended a nearly 4 decades long career in tattooing. I did this as a leap of faith and to force myself to devote 100% effort to making this project come to fruition. Did I make the right call? I think so. This is where my heart has led me and it is the path I have chosen to follow. I would love for you to share this journey with me as we explore the beauty of the lands and landmarks of the Southern Appalachian Mountains!



  Risks & Challenges Travel expenses are the biggest challenge in the completion of the project. The southern portion of the Appalachian Mountains extend from southern Maryland all the way down into South Carolina. It's a lot of space to cover. Ideally, I would like to acquire a travel trailer to save on expenses like hotels, food, and maintaining a space to use my computer for editing images. I have been working on some trade deals to that end. 
Weather is also always a consideration when it comes to outdoor photography, however, I do own an umbrella and I don't believe I would melt if I got wet. Protecting the cameras and lenses is first priority in inclement weather.

  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. Please, pass the word to all your friends and contacts. The more people that know of this project, the more likely we can reach or, even, exceed our goals. I will even provide a pre-written outline of the project that can be copied and pasted to your emails and social media posts on my blog at www.jmhillphoto.com/blog.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

THE
BEGINNING WAS THE END is an exhibition that translates traditional knowledge
from the Indonesian island of Java and how it intersects with contemporary
ideas about nature and reality. By applying my own original research to my art
practice, I am experimenting with how this dying knowledge might be brought to
the West by new media, and how it may innovate that same technology. *(Please see Wade Davis at The Long Now Foundation, 01.13.2010.)


WHAT BEGAN â€˜THE BEGINNINGâ€™?


I
started my independent research in Java in 2008. Over four months of talking
with a dalang (shadowpuppet master)
about things like the structure of human consciousness, animism, and devices
that express time in terms of infinite, cyclical patterns of energies, I saw
extraordinary relationships to cognitive science, theoretical physics, and science
fiction. In 2009, I was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to
research them by the US Department of State. 

 


For
the next year, I explored traditional tools for navigating alternate dimensions
of reality. I worked with Javanese philosophy professors, with Ki Sutino
Hardono Carito, the oldest living dukun
(shaman) in Central Java, and experienced the rituals I studied first hand. I
made diagrams of these complex ideas, and designed them in the style of
Indonesian educational posters to imagine traditional knowledge being taught in
State
classrooms (where, as an intervention, this project will actually
install them). And I began to hear that some of this research has never been done before. 




What's
most important to me is that people experience these ideas through feeling.
Over a six-month residency, I collaborated with pioneering artists, like the new media lab House Of Natural Fiber, to make models of them in videosculpture and live-processed
sound.  
















 










These pieces represent 3-dimensional chunks erased
from our reality, revealing the alternate forces and energies present in the
same time and space we occupy. In 2010, THE BEGINNING WAS THE END opened at Cemeti Art House; since then it's featured in cellsbutton#04, #05, Video Vortex #7, and led to an invitation to present
at UC Santa
Barbaraâ€™s College of Creative Studies. After a full year of shipping
problems, I recently went back to Java on a four-day trip to rescue this
now-damaged work. This Spring at Kala
Art Institute, Iâ€™ll finally be able to complete its prints,
sound, videosculptures, and annotated book, A Field Guide To Hybrid Reality,
over a 3-month residency.  


  

 
But I canâ€™t do it without your help!


WHAT WILL YOUR GENEROUS DOLLARS SUPPORT?

THE
BEGINNING WAS THE END is already 75% complete, but I need your support to see
it through. I need to raise a minimum of
$15,000 to help cover:
Â·       costs
associated with 3-month artist residency at Kala Art Institute, including
studio fees 
Â·       video
pre- and post-production costs, including mapping video to 3D sculptures and
installation
Â·       surround
sound design, production, and installation
Â·       digital
printing of educational posters, including materials and processing
Â·       language
translation services and shipping for Indonesia-bound posters
Â·       production
of A Field Guide To Hybrid Reality, an annotated companion to the
posters
Â·       development
of web-based content for upcoming exhibitions and symposia, and beyond
Â·       refinishing
of damaged polyester resin sculptures













 











What's
great is that I'm starting this
campaign having already met 1/3 of my goal, so if 200 people contribute
$50, Iâ€™ll have all the funds I need. But even the smallest donation is
important, and thanks to my fiscal sponsor, Fractured Atlas, any
amount is TAX DEDUCTIBLE. 


In return, some singular rewards that reflect the spirit and
culture of Java will be yours. More details about the awards and their makers
will be provided in my regular updates. Please help spread the word by emailing
this video, joining me on Facebook, and
talking to people the old-fashioned way about this important research, at the
crossroads of several disciplines.

If we exceed our goal, my team and I can complete this work sooner,
and in time for the International Symposium of Electronic Arts (ISEA), the ZER01 symposium, and
Ars Electronica, all taking
place in summer, 2012. 


I
sincerely appreciate your support, and I'm excited to see how together we can
contribute to how we know our world, how we know ourselves, and what art can
be. Thank you!

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>For the past year I have been vigorously focusing on moving forward and elevating my career as a visual artist. I have been engaging with my work in new and profound ways both aesthetically and intellectually and I am incredibly excited as to where this is leading me. My daily routine balances the production of this new work with a lot of time writing residency and grant applications, art show proposals, and entering art prize competitions. I dedicate a lot of time to working, experimenting and writing in my sketchbook on a daily basis as well. If I am at the grocery store where I stock shelves and tell people where mayonnaise ""lives"" - I have a smaller, pocket sized sketchbook that I am always quickly scribbling notes and drawings into when I think the boss is not looking. I always have my craft or new ideas on my mind in some form - and if you know me well at all (or know anyone, really, who has no problem unabashedly labeling themselves an artist), then you know this isn’t just a career for me but rather it makes up a large portion of who I am as a person.</p>
<p>That said, I am happy to announce, after a lot of hard work this past year, I have been accepted into the NES Artist Residency program in a place called Skagaströnd, Iceland. This is a three month residency which will begin later this year. I will live and work in the small northern commune of Skagaströnd, creating a whole new body of work while meeting and interacting with some great new creative thinking people. I will have a home and a studio space, be giving public artist talks, mentoring high-school kids and showing my work to my peers and the local community in multiple exhibition settings. I am very humbled and thankful for this opportunity and it is certainly something that will propel my career forward, open doors and ultimately lead to more great possibilities for me.</p>
<p>However, this is not something that rewards me monetarily. In fact, it’s the opposite. I have to put out a lot of cash to make this happen. Fortunately, I live in place where there are grants and funding out there for artists like myself. I have already begun applying for as many of the grants that I am eligible for - and I am somewhat confident I will be able to convince some of these fine people to help me pay for this.</p>
<p>The reason I have created this crowdfunding profile is to raise money for the required deposit needed to secure my spot with the residency. The deposit is the first months fee and totals to about 1150 Canadian dollars (or 93,942 Icelandic krona). It is due to be payed within one month of my acceptance letter (which I received yesterday) and if I am unable to secure money for and pay this deposit within this approximate thirty day time-frame, I will not be able to accept my placement. Not only did I not completely anticipate being accepted into this program (lately, I have been viewing these applications as an exercise in dealing with rejection, heh) I also did not expect the news to come so quickly after applying. So, my goal is to sell quality prints of my work at $25 a piece through this funding page. There is another tier featuring a hand painted portrait option, in case you have some nice bonus money just burning a hole in your pocket. But, if I sell only forty prints, I can make up the majority of the money I require.</p>
<p>Most likely if you are reading this, you have probably supported me in the past in some form or another. Maybe it was something as small as shooting me a like or comment on a piece of art I shared on social media, or maybe you attended a weird puppet show I put on, or commissioned me to draw your cat ...or bought a print. Whatever it was, I am very grateful for it and for your support now.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I've been an independent artist, illustrator and designer since 2006. My Custom Tarot Deck series began way back in 2008, it's seen a lot of revisions but now it's finally finished! Of course, a full Tarot Deck is 78 Cards, so at this stage I've designed the most important cards - the Major Arcana - which you can do simple, general readings with. I'd love to release each suit separately in the future and offer a handmade, stitched bag to store the full deck.<br/></p>
<p>The Major Arcana deck features vintage and retro digital collage artworks which is my trademark artistic style. I put a lot of research into each card, to accurately represent the meanings and symbolism of each - just about every detail is there for a reason and not just to look pretty!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've had a lot of interest in the cards ever since I first started. People have been asking when the set will be available to buy - many want to buy a set as a gift for their Mum! The cards have definitely aroused the strongest emotional response of all my artwork and it would be a shame not to see them produced! <br/></p>
<p>I have no other funding sources, so if I don't reach my target amount
 then I'll have to hussle myself to friends and family to invest the 
remaining amount. I'm determined to get this project off the ground one 
way or another, but without support I may have to shelve the project indefinitely.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>CLICK THE UPDATES TAB TO GET THE LATEST INFO - THINGS HAVE CHANGED!<br/></p>
<p>Printing, production and shipping costs are at the $1000 mark, give or take. It's a race against time to get these done in time for Christmas! Depending on funds raised I can get 100 decks printed or 500 - it all comes down to different printers. </p>

<b>Summary</b></p>
<p>
<b>We want to raise $30,000 in 30
days, and you can help!</b></p>
<p>
Raising $30,000 by November 30
will allow us to continue our wonderful theater, music, and arts
programs. For 47 years we have provided fine arts exhibitions and
extraordinary theater and music performances to all of East Hawaii.
We want to continue the tradition of providing art exhibits, low cost
arts performances and arts education to our community, but IT TAKES
YOU TO SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS!</p>
<p>
Give the gift of ART to Hilo -
Make a contribution to the<a href=""http://www.ehcc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>
East Hawai`i Cultural Council, and Hawai`i Museum of Contemporary
Art</u></a>, and
receive a mahalo makana of art - which you can keep for yourself OR
get a jump on holiday gift giving!</p>
<p>
By making a contribution to
<a href=""http://www.ehcc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>EHCC/HMOCA</u></a>
you are insuring that our community continues to receive the benefits
of participation in the arts and arts education. Every contributor
will receive a surprise gift that you or a loved one will treasure.</p>
<p>The
<a href=""http://www.ehcc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>East
Hawai`i Cultural Council</u></a>
has been a huge part of Hilo's culture and arts scene for 47 years.
That's a LOT of dedication on the part of the many volunteers like
you who have made <a href=""http://www.ehcc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>EHCC</u></a>
the center for arts and culture. Donations by people like YOU make
all the difference! So, we thank you for all your kokua over the
years, and look forward to your continued support. 
</p>
<p>
As you know federal, state and
county funding is now greatly reduced and we depend on public support
to make our programs successful. <a href=""http://www.ehcc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>EHCC/HMOCA</u></a>
is a private arts organization run by volunteers. All of the funds we
receive go into programs. We have no paid staff.

I’ve been an arts educator for over 30 years in the San Francisco

facilities. As an arts administrator instrumental in establishing non
for profit arts centers in San Francisco Area, I’m proud to be able
to bring my expertise to the Hawaii Museum of Contemporary Art as I
believe that this community deserves a first rate arts and cultural
institution. Through my efforts we have been accepted by the <a href=""http://www.aam-us.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Alliance

<b>Artists
Contribute to the Community</b></p>
<p>
We want to continue giving
experienced artists a supportive venue, and to continue facilitating
young artists who are just starting out.</p>
<p>
For many Hawai`i Island artists
who came of age in the past 50 years, <a href=""http://www.ehcc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>EHCC</u></a>
helped them to get their start and to grow professionally. </p>
<p>
Our artists, in both performing
and visual fields, are strong contributors to Hawai`i Island's
economy, and are among the island's leaders in promoting
environmental awareness. The arts bring awareness, and it is a
renewable resource!

Through your generous
contributions we can keep the dream alive. Remember, it was the East
Hawaii Community who created this facility 47 years ago. It is your
premier arts facility and we need your help.</p>
<p>
<b>What
We Need </b>
</p>
<p>
We began the year in the clear,
and want to end it the same way. As we all know, the great programs
we facilitate cost money. While all of the programs give value to our
community, not all of them generate income. So we rely on donors like
you to help us continue to serve Hilo and Hawai`i Island.</p>
<p>
The first $30,000 we receive will
be used for renovations of our buildings to ensure that they are
handicapped accessible and that we have comfortable updated
bathrooms. 
</p>
<p>
Your contributions will provide
us with the funds to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	Renovate our main exhibition
	rooms with new paint and repairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Build new updated walls
	throughout the galleries that will be bright, clean, and uniform
	bringing a new fresher appearance to the exhibitions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Establish a new jewelry and
	textile design center attracting professional staff as well as
	enabling visiting artists and craftspeople a place to stay on site
	while they teach workshops. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Complete a certified kitchen
	which will allow us to bring in visiting chefs who will teach
	culinary arts. In addition, we will be able to hold weddings and
	receptions utilizing the wonderful space that we occupy and
	integrating Kalakaua Park. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>
Should we fall short of the
$30,000 in this funding drive, all of the funds received will go into
our current renovations.

We want to raise $30,000 in 30
days, and you can help!

Raising $30,000 by November 30
will allow us to continue our wonderful theater, music, and arts
programs. For 47 years we have provided fine arts exhibitions and
extraordinary theater and music performances to all of East Hawaii.
We want to continue the tradition of providing art exhibits, low cost
arts performances and arts education to our community, but IT TAKES
YOU TO SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS!

Give the gift of ART to Hilo -
Make a contribution to the
East Hawai`i Cultural Council, and Hawai`i Museum of Contemporary
Art, and
receive a mahalo makana of art - which you can keep for yourself OR
get a jump on holiday gift giving!

By making a contribution to
EHCC/HMOCA
you are insuring that our community continues to receive the benefits
of participation in the arts and arts education. Every contributor
will receive a surprise gift that you or a loved one will treasure.
The
East
Hawai`i Cultural Council
has been a huge part of Hilo's culture and arts scene for 47 years.
That's a LOT of dedication on the part of the many volunteers like
you who have made EHCC
the center for arts and culture. Donations by people like YOU make
all the difference! So, we thank you for all your kokua over the
years, and look forward to your continued support. 


As you know federal, state and
county funding is now greatly reduced and we depend on public support
to make our programs successful. EHCC/HMOCA
is a private arts organization run by volunteers. All of the funds we
receive go into programs. We have no paid staff. 


Aloha!
My
name is Lourdan Kimbrell, President of the EHCC
Board of Directors
and acting Director of the Hawaii
Museum of Contemporary Art.
I’ve been an arts educator for over 30 years in the San Francisco
Bay Area teaching at California College of Art, Sonoma State
University, and San Francisco Art Institute among other arts
facilities. As an arts administrator instrumental in establishing non
for profit arts centers in San Francisco Area, I’m proud to be able
to bring my expertise to the Hawaii Museum of Contemporary Art as I
believe that this community deserves a first rate arts and cultural
institution. Through my efforts we have been accepted by the Alliance
of American Museums
for their assessment and accreditation program which will enable us
to provide professionally guided programs and events in Hilo.

What
We've Done

A lot is happening to the old
East
Hawaii Cultural Center
which has a new name, Hawaii
Museum of Contemporary Art
~ a new organization,
a new mission and a new face. We are undergoing a lot of renovations
to the buildings at our downtown Hilo site. We are working on a
$50,000 window replacement and restoration project through a grant
from Historic Hawaii Foundation. 


The buildings on our site, once
the Central Police Offices, Municipal Court and temporary holding
jail, are on the National
Register of Historic Places,
In addition to the window renovations we are currently planning:



	New and improved classroom
	spaces with upgraded lighting.



	New rehearsal space.



	Artist in residence apartment



	Certified kitchen



	New gallery for photography
	exhibitions.



	On site museum store featuring
	the best of the best of local art and handmade 
	



	womens accessories and jewelry. 
	



	Plus a new Lanai Coffee Bar for
	your enjoyment.


We/re also developing new
exciting classes for keiki, students, adults and retired folks so
they  have access to the highest level of extended arts education
possible. We are engaging new professional teachers who are masters
of their craft and we hope to develop a jewelry and textile design
department. We, of course, will continue to provide excellent classes
in photography, theater, voice training, yoga, martial arts, and much
much more.

<p>Ladies and
Gentlemen! Boys and Girls! Freaks, Geeks, and Weirdos! Welcome to the Snake Oil
Festival! The Snake Oil Festival is New Orleans' only event dedicated to
preserving the art and spirit of America's rich circus and sideshow history.
During the 19th Century, traveling medicine shows brought incomparable and
unmatched entertainment to America's masses. Combining the seductive arts of
burlesque, the oddities of the sideshow, hilarious comedy, preaching, mystics,
music, and of course showmanship, the snake oil medicine shows offered the cure
all for the ailments of the American psyche.</p>
<p>Not only were the
medicine shows an antidote to boredom and mediocrity, but the roots of this
unique experience stood at the vanguard of the American entertainment industry
and spawned generations of legendary talent.</p>
<p>Ben Wisdom, Little
Luna, and Ginger Licious are pleased to announce upcoming plans to
introduce a community oriented variety arts festival to New Orleans set to take
place in June of 2015. In keeping with that creative spirit and as a nod to the
colorful traditions of the past, we chose the name Snake Oil.</p>
<p>We as producers and
performers are passionate about bringing exciting and unique art forms to the
stage. Ben Wisdom is the co-producer and emcee of the award winning Slow
Burn Burlesque and the Unholy Roller Revival. He is also the emcee for the
famous Dirty Dime Peepshow and has appeared in American Horror Story. Little
Luna is an accomplished burlesque performer, resident Snake Oil Festival tarot
reader, and the co-producer of the Unholy Roller Revival in New Orleans. She is
also a co-founding member and former producer of the award winning Gilded Lily
Burlesque in Baltimore, Maryland. Ginger Licious is a multi-talented, award winning burlesque,
circus, and variety artist, and she is the co-producer of Slow Burn Burlesque
and produces the wildly popular, Cirque d'Licious in New Orleans.</p>
<p>The Snake Oil
Festival will be oriented towards highlighting alternative arts in New Orleans
and beyond, spanning many genres. Our approach is an innovative mix of
community building, education, artistic support and development, cultural
preservation, and three days of variety entertainment that will blow your mind.</p>
<p>We have been working
hard to bring this collaborative effort to life, and your generous contribution
will bring us even further toward that goal.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Snake Oil will consist
of three fun packed shows spread out over three days in the Big Easy. The
festival will showcase the best and brightest from the local and world wide
variety arts scene and will offer classes and seminars to both performers and
spectators, which will be brought to you in conjunction with Bella Blue's New
Orleans School of Burlesque. These classes will be taught by leading
professionals in these genres. To bring this to the stage we need your support.

</p>
<p><span>We are raising $10,000
to make this festival a reality. The money will go towards paying travel
expenses, housing, and fees for our outstanding entertainers, which we estimate
to be $2,500. Any money raised will also be used to secure our one of a kind
venues, professional staff, and artistic support. These expenses will reach
$3,000. In addition we need funds to pay for equipment rental, decorations, in
town transportation, incidentals, and hospitality for our talented artists.
These costs will approach another $3,000. Also, we are seeking funds to
advertise this unique event, which will cost $1,500.  If we partially
reach our goal, we will use the funds that we do raise to pay our headlining
entertainers and venue costs, as this is our priority. </span></p>
<p>As a thank you, we are
excited to offer you some stellar gifts and incentives. We are offering VIP tickets to the Snake Oil Festival, limited edition posters, tarot card
readings via telephone by Little Luna, bumper stickers, mentions on our
website, vouchers for free classes at the Snake Oil Festival, and special Snake
Oil Bath Elixir, our very own, homemade tub time remedy!

</p>
<p><span><b></b></span></p>
<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Snake
Oil Festival seeks to create opportunities for artists and spectators alike to
participate in a uniquely entertaining and educational partnership, which helps
the traditions of Americana culture and entertainment to thrive. Live
entertainment has always been a force that unifies communities and connects us
all to one another. No place exemplifies this idea more than the city of New
Orleans. New Orleans has always been the cultural heart and soul of the
United States. It is a port town with a varied and colorful history. For almost
three centuries now people just as varied and colorful have been attracted to
the Crescent City and it's these unique individuals who have shaped her
creative landscape. The variety arts scene and the entertainers that populate
it have a similar pulse. It is a microcosm of what the spirit of New Orleans
represents. Through classes, performance, and networking opportunities all
set in the iconic cultural Mecca that is the Crescent City, we hope to honor
these traditions and create a few of our own in June of 2015.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Challenges</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>No one
wants to lose their shirt over a burlesque show, or do they? In all seriousness
we recognize that with any creative or business endeavor there will be
risks and challenges. The biggest challenge will be securing the funds we need
to put on a grand event. Other, challenges include overcoming the
organizational and logistical hurdles associated with coordinating a series of
shows on this scale. However, if there's one thing burlesque has taught
all three of us, it's how to make it work. We are no strangers to operating on a
shoestring or stripping out of one. Make no mistake, The Snake Oil Festival is
happening and we will produce our event with whatever resources we are able to
bring. We plan to engage volunteers and our network of skills to bring this to
life. With just a little help from our friends we can really make this festival
an experience to remember for everyone.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>There are
many ways that you can help support the Snake Oil Festival! Any and all types
of support are appreciated and necessary. Be sure to share our campaign with
others who might be interested via social media and make sure to follow us on

<h2><strong>The Project</strong></h2>
<p>Local artists and originators are Linda Erzinger, assemblage artist and Tara Remington mixed media 2D/3D installation artist. They have designed Herman the Strider Bug as Louisville’s first outdoor rain catchment sculpture made from repurposed material. Herman is part of a growing art form that supports environmental issues and the arts, called <strong>Solution Based Art</strong>. Herman will serve as a water catchment system and educate the Louisville community about water conservation and will also act as a canopy from the sun for an urban garden.</p>
<p> Tara and Linda will begin construction on Herman’s rebar frame work at the end of March, at a local temporary studio location. The public will be invited to work on Herman on April Saturday and Sunday 13 &amp; 14 in the studio location, and then again on April 20 &amp;21, to move and assemble the sculpture on site.  A dedication will be on Saturday 11am, April 27<sup>th</sup>, for the sculpture during the Mayors Week of Service the week of April 21st. </p>
<h2><strong>Partners </strong></h2>
<p>The Center for Neighborhoods is our fiscal partner. Other organizations involved in this project will help to collect reusable materials to build Herman’s outer shell.  A citywide water cleanup will begin in March 2013 and will run for a couple of weeks to assist in cleanups. Local organizations that will be participating in these clean ups will be; United Metro Way, Brightside, Kentucky Waterway Alliance, Bear Grass Creek Alliance and Olmstead Park Conservancy.</p>
<p>    The materials that will cover and embellish Herman will be modified from a variety of recycled objects.  Plastic from water bottles, metal from appliances, tennis balls, car tires, bottle caps, all materials will be cleaned &amp; cut for particular use on each area of Herman’s body. For instance the legs will be covered with a system of overlapping water bottles segments creating a strong bond for the environment aging process.  The top of Herman’s back will be constructed from metal that will be shingled from reused appliance parts.  The systems of attaching these objects will generate a fun, colorful, overall skin or covering for Herman’s metal framework.</p>
<h2><strong>Herman's Traits</strong></h2>
<p>Herman stands at his highest point of 8’and will also act as a 5’ x 8’ canopy for public use.  Herman legs span an area of 10’ x 14’and at his outer most points where his feet are located are recycled tires as places to sit. The entire structure will be anchored into the ground with concrete footers.   The framework of the water catchment is constructed of   ¾” to 1”metal rebar and welded together where the legs meet the body.  All parts of this sculpture have been designed for public use so structural safety has been very important to us as we have partnered with a local engineer.  </p>
<p>One of the main features of the catchment is a rain chain. The rain chain is positioned at the front of Herman’s head acting as a downspout into a small garden area; the chain will be created from recovered bike chains and other found material. </p>
<p>We are pleased and proud to be creating this model of Herman to the Louisville area as its birth place!</p>
<h2>Striding to Make a Difference</h2>
<p>The strider bug does not break the surface of the water, but glides on top.  This alludes to a way to tread lightly on Earth.  With all the talk about reducing our “environmental footprint,” taking lessons from the strider bug sounds like a fun prospect.  This community endeavor creates an effective spirit of effort that can transmit positive change within our community.  </p>
<h2><strong>Artist Bio's</strong></h2>
<p>Tara Remington and Linda Erzinger are the visionaries behind Art ReSourced. They are professional working artists who live and work in the Louisville area. They have been using recycled materials for 26 years combined. Striding toward the future with an inventive project like <em>Herman the water catchment</em> brings together their shared inspiration to link art with environmental solutions.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><a href=""http://lindaerzinger.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Linda Erzinger</strong></a> earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Illustration at the Savannah College of Art and Design. Savannah remained home while working freelance doing murals, photography and assorted art related jobs. Erzinger's 1994 move inland to Louisville, KY came with the pursuit of a Master's Degree in Expressive Therapies from the University of Louisville. After working as an art therapist for many years she is now back to full time art. She also teaches art in partnership with community organizations and through grant initiatives. Linda's work focuses on the environment and reuse of obscure materials. Recurring themes of humanity's relationship with nature predominate and are reflected in themes of fertility, circles, cycles and growth.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Remington</strong> is a 2D/3D mixed media artist, arts educator, creative facilitator and a professional artist for over 25 years she received her formal eductaion at Ringling School of Art, Sarasota FL and Portfolio Center, Atlanta GA. The past three years her focus has been on indoor and outdoor large scale installations. She is also an advocate for the environment and promotes solution based art - art that inspires and creates sustainable solutions in our communities. She partners with local organizations on many educational and inspired projects; Louisville Visual Art Association, Kentucky Center for the Arts, Kentucky Museum of Art and Crafts, Fund for the Arts, Southern Indiana Council for the Arts, Broadway Over Louisville, Maryhurst, St. Joe’s Orphanage. Tara recently was awarded a grant from Kentucky Foundation for Woman and is teaching workshops that support the power of creativity to inspire and connect with self and community. She believes we all have a creative part to play in advocating sustainable changes in ourselves, our communities and for our earth.     </p>
<h2><strong>Budget-$9,000</strong></h2>
<p>Materials and supplies $500</p>
<p>Equipment $300</p>
<p>Promotional and marketing material $200</p>
<p>Space rental $500</p>
<p>IndieGoGo and Center for Neighborhood fees $1,215</p>
<p>Artist fees $6,285</p>
<p>As artists living in a challenging economy we desire to make a living wage during this project.  If we do not receive full funding we will continue with the project, motivated by our belief that this sculpture will be a benefit to our local community.  We firmly believe that solution based art provides creative results for educating and making connections between community and the environment.</p>
<p>If we exceed the goal we will be happy artists who will be able to invest in contributing to other community projects and to our future creative goals. </p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>You may be wondering...where is this awesome sculputre going to live.  Well we are currently in negotiations on that matter.  What we do know is that it will be in a public community garden.  That is all we can tell you right now.  The rest is top secret for the moment. </p>

<p> </p></div>","“Herman the Strider Bug” –-A Water Catchment System:
The Project
Local artists and originators are Linda Erzinger, assemblage artist and Tara Remington mixed media 2D/3D installation artist. They have designed Herman the Strider Bug as Louisville’s first outdoor rain catchment sculpture made from repurposed material. Herman is part of a growing art form that supports environmental issues and the arts, called Solution Based Art. Herman will serve as a water catchment system and educate the Louisville community about water conservation and will also act as a canopy from the sun for an urban garden.
 Tara and Linda will begin construction on Herman’s rebar frame work at the end of March, at a local temporary studio location. The public will be invited to work on Herman on April Saturday and Sunday 13 & 14 in the studio location, and then again on April 20 &21, to move and assemble the sculpture on site.  A dedication will be on Saturday 11am, April 27th, for the sculpture during the Mayors Week of Service the week of April 21st. 
Partners 
The Center for Neighborhoods is our fiscal partner. Other organizations involved in this project will help to collect reusable materials to build Herman’s outer shell.  A citywide water cleanup will begin in March 2013 and will run for a couple of weeks to assist in cleanups. Local organizations that will be participating in these clean ups will be; United Metro Way, Brightside, Kentucky Waterway Alliance, Bear Grass Creek Alliance and Olmstead Park Conservancy.
    The materials that will cover and embellish Herman will be modified from a variety of recycled objects.  Plastic from water bottles, metal from appliances, tennis balls, car tires, bottle caps, all materials will be cleaned & cut for particular use on each area of Herman’s body. For instance the legs will be covered with a system of overlapping water bottles segments creating a strong bond for the environment aging process.  The top of Herman’s back will be constructed from metal that will be shingled from reused appliance parts.  The systems of attaching these objects will generate a fun, colorful, overall skin or covering for Herman’s metal framework.
Herman's Traits
Herman stands at his highest point of 8’and will also act as a 5’ x 8’ canopy for public use.  Herman legs span an area of 10’ x 14’and at his outer most points where his feet are located are recycled tires as places to sit. The entire structure will be anchored into the ground with concrete footers.   The framework of the water catchment is constructed of   ¾” to 1”metal rebar and welded together where the legs meet the body.  All parts of this sculpture have been designed for public use so structural safety has been very important to us as we have partnered with a local engineer.  
One of the main features of the catchment is a rain chain. The rain chain is positioned at the front of Herman’s head acting as a downspout into a small garden area; the chain will be created from recovered bike chains and other found material. 
We are pleased and proud to be creating this model of Herman to the Louisville area as its birth place!
Striding to Make a Difference
The strider bug does not break the surface of the water, but glides on top.  This alludes to a way to tread lightly on Earth.  With all the talk about reducing our “environmental footprint,” taking lessons from the strider bug sounds like a fun prospect.  This community endeavor creates an effective spirit of effort that can transmit positive change within our community.  
Artist Bio's
Tara Remington and Linda Erzinger are the visionaries behind Art ReSourced. They are professional working artists who live and work in the Louisville area. They have been using recycled materials for 26 years combined. Striding toward the future with an inventive project like Herman the water catchment brings together their shared inspiration to link art with environmental solutions.
Linda Erzinger earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Illustration at the Savannah College of Art and Design. Savannah remained home while working freelance doing murals, photography and assorted art related jobs. Erzinger's 1994 move inland to Louisville, KY came with the pursuit of a Master's Degree in Expressive Therapies from the University of Louisville. After working as an art therapist for many years she is now back to full time art. She also teaches art in partnership with community organizations and through grant initiatives. Linda's work focuses on the environment and reuse of obscure materials. Recurring themes of humanity's relationship with nature predominate and are reflected in themes of fertility, circles, cycles and growth.
Tara Remington is a 2D/3D mixed media artist, arts educator, creative facilitator and a professional artist for over 25 years she received her formal eductaion at Ringling School of Art, Sarasota FL and Portfolio Center, Atlanta GA. The past three years her focus has been on indoor and outdoor large scale installations. She is also an advocate for the environment and promotes solution based art - art that inspires and creates sustainable solutions in our communities. She partners with local organizations on many educational and inspired projects; Louisville Visual Art Association, Kentucky Center for the Arts, Kentucky Museum of Art and Crafts, Fund for the Arts, Southern Indiana Council for the Arts, Broadway Over Louisville, Maryhurst, St. Joe’s Orphanage. Tara recently was awarded a grant from Kentucky Foundation for Woman and is teaching workshops that support the power of creativity to inspire and connect with self and community. She believes we all have a creative part to play in advocating sustainable changes in ourselves, our communities and for our earth.     
Budget-$9,000
Materials and supplies $500
Equipment $300
Promotional and marketing material $200
Space rental $500
IndieGoGo and Center for Neighborhood fees $1,215
Artist fees $6,285
As artists living in a challenging economy we desire to make a living wage during this project.  If we do not receive full funding we will continue with the project, motivated by our belief that this sculpture will be a benefit to our local community.  We firmly believe that solution based art provides creative results for educating and making connections between community and the environment.
If we exceed the goal we will be happy artists who will be able to invest in contributing to other community projects and to our future creative goals. 
Location
You may be wondering...where is this awesome sculputre going to live.  Well we are currently in negotiations on that matter.  What we do know is that it will be in a public community garden.  That is all we can tell you right now.  The rest is top secret for the moment.

<p><b>Rate My Artist Residency</b> was
founded January 2013 in Berlin, Germany by Katrina Neumann (a visual artist).
Rate My Artist Residency acts in part as a public relations platform for
emerging and established residencies, alternative programming, and artistic
communities.
The main impetus for beginning Rate My Artist Residency was to create clarity behind
residency programs and allow artists to have a social platform to engage
anonymously and exchange information about their experiences. </p><p>The<b> Artists Helping Artists Grant</b>
 is an idea launched from Rate My Artist Residency’s subtitle. One of 
the most difficult obstacles with artist residencies is being able to 
afford the residency. I want to utilize crowd-sourcing fundraising on <strong>indiegogo</strong>
 to create a grant that need-based artists in the United States can 
apply to unrestricted funding for a residency in 2015. The artists’ who 
apply to the grant must provide proof of need-based income and a letter 
from the residency with their acceptance in 2015. A jury will review 
finalists and select the recipients of the Artists Helping Artists 
Grant. The application for the grant will launch in Fall 2014 and the 
award will be announced in the new year of 2015.</p>
<p>The raised 
funds through this new initiative will be split into four portions and 
awarded to the selected artists. Currently, the fundraising goal is 
$2,000 USD and each artist will receive around $500 USD for the 
residency (indiegogo fees apply). The grant is unrestricted and used 
towards the residency as the artist sees fit; this includes residency 
fees, artist materials, studio space, travel, room, board, food, 
shipping, a portion of their apartment rent, etc. It is my hopes to 
raise more than the $2,000 USD goal to help artists receive a larger 
stipend this year and years to come.</p>

<p>The<b> Artists Helping Artists Grant</b>’s
 goal is $2,000 USD. All of the funds from the fundraising goal (whether
 more or less) will be split into four unlimited need-based residency 
grants. The grant is awarded to four artists that demonstrate a need for
 financial assistance and have been awarded a residency for the 
following year. The unrestricted 
grant allows the artist to attend the residency and be able to pay for 
residency fees, materials, travel, room, board, shipping of materials, 
food, etc. The use of the funds are at the discretion of the artist 
while in residence. Your contributions help other artists carve out the 
time and space needed to make their work and build their career through 
the social opportunities provided at artist residencies worldwide.</p>
<p>If you 
donate between $25-$50, your application fee for the grant is waived. 
The application fee goes towards the administrative costs with the 
remaining balance contributing to theArtists Helping Artists 
Grant. If you donate $50, you and a friend of your choice will have your
 application fee waived for the residency grant.</p>
<p>Donors that 
contribute $100-$500 will be listed on the Rate My Artist Residency 
website as a Friend, Collector, and Benefactor. Collectors and 
Benefactors of the Artists Helping Artists Grant will receive a limited 
edition postcard sized work from the selected grant recipient artists. 
The Collectors receive one work from an artist of their choice and The 
Benefactors receive four works of limited edition postcard sized works 
from all of the selected artists (A Suite Collection).</p>
<p>If the 
Artists Helping Artists Grant does not reach it’s entire goal, then the 
funds will still be divided by four and given to need-based artists in 
the United States that receive a residency in 2015. If the funds are 
below $50, then the donations will be returned.</p>
<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p>It goes 
without saying that for many years artists have benefited from residency
 programs around the world. Each program is an individual gem and at 
times a utopia for artists to temporarily exist. These programs give 
artists the vital time and space allowing them to work on their 
projects, ideas, and creation of contemporary culture. I always 
considered artist residency programs as an alternative business 
conference for the art world. Artists attend these spaces as think 
tanks, social network hubs, and pockets of conversation and dialogue 
analyzing our current and future position as a society in the world 
today. Artists are catalysts and act as the epitome representation of 
freedom in society. By supporting the works of artists, you are 
supporting progressive thought, change, challenging thought provocation,
 the right to a free equal society, and an individual working on 
cultural production.</p>
<p>Rate My 
Artist Residency was born from the idea of having a social platform for 
artists to communicate with each other about their residency 
experiences. The website launched over a year ago and today has over 900
 followers. In the past year, over 50,000 visitors from 100 countries 
visit the website to check out deadlines, residency profiles, and 
ratings of different residency programs. This is the first trial 
initiative of the grant through crowd-sourcing tactics; I hope that it 
finds great success and is able to continue for years to come.</p>
<p>Your 
contributions create a dynamic shift in grant giving through 
crowd-sourcing and contributing to the career of a need-based artist. 
Thank you.</p>

fees, artist materials, studio space, travel, room, board, food, 
shipping, a portion of their apartment rent, etc. It is my hopes to 
raise more than the $2,000 USD goal to help artists receive a larger 
stipend this year and years to come.
(Photography (c) 2013 Jonathan Hordle/Rex Features)What We Need & What You Get
The Artists Helping Artists Grant’s
 goal is $2,000 USD. All of the funds from the fundraising goal (whether
 more or less) will be split into four unlimited need-based residency 
grants. The grant is awarded to four artists that demonstrate a need for
 financial assistance and have been awarded a residency for the 
following year. The unrestricted 
grant allows the artist to attend the residency and be able to pay for 
residency fees, materials, travel, room, board, shipping of materials, 
food, etc. The use of the funds are at the discretion of the artist 
while in residence. Your contributions help other artists carve out the 
time and space needed to make their work and build their career through 
the social opportunities provided at artist residencies worldwide.
If you 
donate between $25-$50, your application fee for the grant is waived. 
The application fee goes towards the administrative costs with the 
remaining balance contributing to theArtists Helping Artists 
Grant. If you donate $50, you and a friend of your choice will have your
 application fee waived for the residency grant.
Donors that 
contribute $100-$500 will be listed on the Rate My Artist Residency 
website as a Friend, Collector, and Benefactor. Collectors and 
Benefactors of the Artists Helping Artists Grant will receive a limited 
edition postcard sized work from the selected grant recipient artists. 
The Collectors receive one work from an artist of their choice and The 
Benefactors receive four works of limited edition postcard sized works 
from all of the selected artists (A Suite Collection).
If the 
Artists Helping Artists Grant does not reach it’s entire goal, then the 
funds will still be divided by four and given to need-based artists in 
the United States that receive a residency in 2015. If the funds are 
below $50, then the donations will be returned.
The Impact
It goes 
without saying that for many years artists have benefited from residency
 programs around the world. Each program is an individual gem and at 
times a utopia for artists to temporarily exist. These programs give 
artists the vital time and space allowing them to work on their 
projects, ideas, and creation of contemporary culture. I always 
considered artist residency programs as an alternative business 
conference for the art world. Artists attend these spaces as think 
tanks, social network hubs, and pockets of conversation and dialogue 
analyzing our current and future position as a society in the world 
today. Artists are catalysts and act as the epitome representation of 
freedom in society. By supporting the works of artists, you are 
supporting progressive thought, change, challenging thought provocation,
 the right to a free equal society, and an individual working on 
cultural production.
Rate My 
Artist Residency was born from the idea of having a social platform for 
artists to communicate with each other about their residency 
experiences. The website launched over a year ago and today has over 900
 followers. In the past year, over 50,000 visitors from 100 countries 
visit the website to check out deadlines, residency profiles, and 
ratings of different residency programs. This is the first trial 
initiative of the grant through crowd-sourcing tactics; I hope that it 
finds great success and is able to continue for years to come.
Your 
contributions create a dynamic shift in grant giving through 
crowd-sourcing and contributing to the career of a need-based artist. 
Thank you.

<p><strong>About us: </strong></p>
<p>The Haifa Museum of Art is the third largest art museum in Israel. Founded in 1951, it houses contemporary Israeli and international art exhibits, viewing art as a holistic, unique, vibrant enterprise. Its geographical location, at the edge of Wadi Nisnas, is a central focal point of local culture, which acts as a linchpin for the three neighborhoods - the Jewish, Muslim and Christian - which meet at this site. The location of the museum therefore enables it to act as a multi-cultural and intercultural bridge, reflecting Haifa's special urban and communal wellsprings.<br/><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Our exhibition: Arts Outer Circles: Outsiders, Naïve and Autodidacts. (February 9th - June 16th 2013) </strong></p>
<p>Last month, Haifa Museum of Art opened the first ever Outsider Art exhibition (also known as Art Brut) in Israel. The aim of the show is to point out this fascinating phenomenon of self-taught individuals who didn't recognize themselves as artists, but created art that is both powerful and beautiful. The exhibition includes works by classical Outsider artists, none of them have ever been shown in Israel –<strong>           Henry Darger, Martin Ramirez, Adolf Wölfli, Aloïse Corbaz, Carlo Zinelli, Bill Traylor, Minnie Evans, Sam Doyle and William Hawkins. </strong>The works are loaned from major museums and private collections from abroad.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>Alongside, we are presenting works by 15 Israeli Autodidact artists, among them<strong> Gabriel Cohen, Shalom of Safed (The Watchmaker of Safed), Moshe Elnatan, the naïve Haifa artists - Natan Haber, Shimshon Lemberger, Menachem Messinger, </strong>and an unknown artist from Tel Aviv<strong> - Ovadia Aggasi.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>So why do we need your help? </strong></p>
<p>We arrived at the finish line of the exhibition with no catalog.  The exhibition budget was consumed by the transportation of the works from abroad and the vast amount of insurance values. The Israeli cultural budget has suffered from growing cutbacks in the last years. As a result, the Museum's obligation to produce meaningful exhibitions for the Israeli public has become extremely difficult. We have become more and more dependent, and at the mercy of private funding. In order to produce a catalogue, a first time ever book in Hebrew on the subject of Outsider Art (Israeli and International), which will include both original and translated texts, and spectacular color reproductions, we are seeking for financial support. We need an addition of 8,500$ for the production. We are constantly asked by all visitors: where can we buy the catalog for this amazing exhibition? We also believe in the necessity of a catalog, it is the only memory left from the exhibition.<br/>Help us achieve this important goal of producing the first Outsider Art book in Israel. Your donation will help make history and leave a living trace of this unique and remarkable art.<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Your donation:</strong> </p>
<p>Contributions start at 30$. We'd like to reward your generosity with different perks, ranging from private tours to unique limited edition of our catalog, published soon with your help.  We hope you'll accept our appeal and donate as much as you can, for the preservation of cultural activity in Israel. We'd also deeply appreciate your help by spreading our campaign publicly in any means you can think of. The success of the catalog lies in reaching as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks, and see you at the show, and hopefully the launch event of the catalog!<br/><br/></p>

מוזיאון חיפה לאמנות הוא מוזיאון האמנות השלישי בגודלו בארץ. הוא הוקם בשנת 1951 ומתמקד בהצגת הדופק החי והפועם של האמנות העכשווית, הישראלית והבינלאומית כאחד. מבחינת היקף פעילותו והרמה המקצועית של התערוכות שהוא מקיים, זהו המוזיאון המרכזי לאמנות באזור הצפון, אשר מבסס את מעמדו כמוזיאון פעיל ודינמי המושך קהל רב. 
המוזיאון רואה עצמו מחויב לייצר הקשר תרבותי-חברתי רחב ביחס לסביבה שבה הוא יושב: על קו התפר שבין שכונות יהודיות לשכונות ערביות ולא רחוק מהקהילה הבהאית. מיקומו הגיאוגרפי של המוזיאון בקצה שכונת הדר, בין הים להר, בין חיפה האדומה של פעם לחיפה הרב-תרבותית של היום -הופך אותו למקום מיוחד במינו, המשלב באופן טבעי היסטוריה, תרבות וחברה.
התערוכה שלנו: במעגלים אחרים: אאוטסיידרים, נאיבים אוטודידקטים 
(ה-9 לפברואר עד ה-16 ליוני 2013)
אוצרת: רותי דירקטור
אוצרת משנה: נטלי סמית
בחודש פברואר נפתחה במוזיאון חיפה לאמנות תערוכת של אמנות אאוטסיידרים (הידועה גם כארט ברוט) לראשונה בישראל.
התערוכה עוסקת עוסקת באמנים אאוטסיידרים - אנשים שלא למדו אמנות ולא פעלו בתוך עולם האמנות, ולעתים חיו בשולי החברה, אך צרו אמנות מרתקת ורבת עוצמה.מדובר באנשים שבשלב מסוים בחייהם התחילו לעשות אמנות, בדרך כלל לצייר, ועשו זאת מתוך דחף פנימי שאינו בר שליטה. חלקם היו מאושפזים בבתי חולים לחולי נפש (מרטין רמירז, אדולף וולפלי), אחרים מעולם לא אובחנו או אושפזו, אך חיו חיי פרישות ובדידות (הנרי דארגר). עבור כולם הציור הוא גאולה. בדרך כלל אין להם עניין להציג, להראות את עבודותיהם או לקבל הכרה, ובדרך כלל נדרש תיווכם של ""אינסיידרים"" - אמנים, אספנים, גלריסטים או פסיכולוגים, כדי להביא את אמנותם לידיעת הקהל הרחב. 
בתערוכה תוצגנה לראשונה בארץ עבודות של אמנים אאוטסיידרים קלאסיים: אדולף וולפלי, מרטין רמירז, ביל טריילור, הנרי דארגר, אלואיז, סם דויל, וויליאם הוקינס, מיני אוונס, קרלו זינלי. העבודות מושאלות מאוספים פרטיים ומוזיאליים בארה""ב ובאירופה. 
לצדם יוצגו אמנים נאיביים ועממיים בולטים מהארץ - שלום מצפת (השען מצפת), גבריאל כהן, משה אלנתן, וכן, ארבעה אמנים אוטודידקטים חיפאיים:נתן הבר, שמשון למברגר, מנחם מסינגר, מוחמד פאדל. 
כמו כן, יוצגו מקרים נוספים אחרים של אמנים אאוטסיידרים מקומיים - עובדיה אגסי, עאפיה שמריהו, נסים כחלון, דוד שטראוס (מתוך ""מוזיאון מאיר אגסי""), ואמנים ישראליים המציגים את בחירתם (פסח סלבוסקי מציג את דבורה אגרונוב, רעות פרסטר מציגה את עדי גוב ארי,       דלית שרון מציגה את דנה לין). 
אז מה אנחנו רוצים מכם?
הגענו לקו הגמר של התערוכה בלי קטלוג. ההובלה של העבודות מחו""ל וסכומי הביטוח העצומים, השאירו אותנו ללא תקציב. תקציב בתרבות בישראל סובל בשנים האחרונות מקיצוצים הולכים וגוברים. כתוצאה מכך המוזיאון מתקשה לעמוד בהתחייבותו להפיק תערוכות משמעותיות עבור הציבור בישראל. הפכנו תלויים יותר ויותר בתמיכה של מימון פרטי.
הצלחנו לגייס עד כה חלק מהסכום הדרוש להפיק קטלוג שהוא בעצם ספר, ומכיל צילומים של העבודות המקסימות מהתערוכה פלוס טקסטים, מאמרים, ושיחות.
אנחנו זקוקים לעוד 30 אלף ₪ כדי שנוכל להפיק את הקטלוג.
כל מי שמבקר בתערוכה, שואל: איפה הקטלוג?
גם אנחנו מאמינים שקטלוג הוא הכרחי, קטלוג הוא הזיכרון של התערוכה, קטלוג הוא מה שנשאר אחרי שהתערוכה מתפרקת ונעלמת.
עזרו לנו לממש את היעד החשוב של קטלוג ראשון של אמנות אאוטסיידרים בישראל. התרומה שלך תהיה חלק ממשהו היסטורי שיעזור להנציח את האמנות המיוחדת ומרהיבה הזו.
התרומה שלכם:
התרומות מתחילות מ-30$. נשמח להעניק לכם הטבות שונות תמורת נדיבותכם, החל מסיורים פרטיים בתערוכה ועד לעותקים של הקטלוג שיצא בקרוב בעזרתכם.
כמו כן נשמח אם תוכלו לסייע בהפצת הקמפיין הזה בכל מדיה או פלטפורמה שתוכלו להעלות על דעתכם. הצלחת הקטלוג תלוייה בהגעתו בפני כמה שיותר אנשים.
אנחנו מקווים שתיענו לפנייתנו, ותתרמו ככל יכולתכם, למען המשך קיומה של פעילות תרבותית בארץ. 
תודה, ולהתראות בתערוכה, ויש לקוות שגם באירוע השקת הקטלוג!
 
About us: 
The Haifa Museum of Art is the third largest art museum in Israel. Founded in 1951, it houses contemporary Israeli and international art exhibits, viewing art as a holistic, unique, vibrant enterprise. Its geographical location, at the edge of Wadi Nisnas, is a central focal point of local culture, which acts as a linchpin for the three neighborhoods - the Jewish, Muslim and Christian - which meet at this site. The location of the museum therefore enables it to act as a multi-cultural and intercultural bridge, reflecting Haifa's special urban and communal wellsprings.
Our exhibition: Arts Outer Circles: Outsiders, Naïve and Autodidacts. (February 9th - June 16th 2013) 
Last month, Haifa Museum of Art opened the first ever Outsider Art exhibition (also known as Art Brut) in Israel. The aim of the show is to point out this fascinating phenomenon of self-taught individuals who didn't recognize themselves as artists, but created art that is both powerful and beautiful. The exhibition includes works by classical Outsider artists, none of them have ever been shown in Israel –           Henry Darger, Martin Ramirez, Adolf Wölfli, Aloïse Corbaz, Carlo Zinelli, Bill Traylor, Minnie Evans, Sam Doyle and William Hawkins. The works are loaned from major museums and private collections from abroad.
Alongside, we are presenting works by 15 Israeli Autodidact artists, among them Gabriel Cohen, Shalom of Safed (The Watchmaker of Safed), Moshe Elnatan, the naïve Haifa artists - Natan Haber, Shimshon Lemberger, Menachem Messinger, and an unknown artist from Tel Aviv - Ovadia Aggasi.
 
So why do we need your help? 
We arrived at the finish line of the exhibition with no catalog.  The exhibition budget was consumed by the transportation of the works from abroad and the vast amount of insurance values. The Israeli cultural budget has suffered from growing cutbacks in the last years. As a result, the Museum's obligation to produce meaningful exhibitions for the Israeli public has become extremely difficult. We have become more and more dependent, and at the mercy of private funding. In order to produce a catalogue, a first time ever book in Hebrew on the subject of Outsider Art (Israeli and International), which will include both original and translated texts, and spectacular color reproductions, we are seeking for financial support. We need an addition of 8,500$ for the production. We are constantly asked by all visitors: where can we buy the catalog for this amazing exhibition? We also believe in the necessity of a catalog, it is the only memory left from the exhibition.Help us achieve this important goal of producing the first Outsider Art book in Israel. Your donation will help make history and leave a living trace of this unique and remarkable art.
Your donation: 
Contributions start at 30$. We'd like to reward your generosity with different perks, ranging from private tours to unique limited edition of our catalog, published soon with your help.  We hope you'll accept our appeal and donate as much as you can, for the preservation of cultural activity in Israel. We'd also deeply appreciate your help by spreading our campaign publicly in any means you can think of. The success of the catalog lies in reaching as many people as possible.
Thanks, and see you at the show, and hopefully the launch event of the catalog!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</ul><h3>What You Get<br/>
</h3><p></p><b>Jollimus Prime Presents: The Official Nerd Card!</b><br/>The same size as an ID or Credit Card, the Official Nerd Card will be brought to you exclusively by Jollimus. Each card will be crafted deep in the heart of the JolliCave, and will bear your chosen name and the date (full or year only) you entered into the nerdy world. The background for the obverse side of the card will be an image of your choosing, at no extra cost to you (please, nothing that will get me sued y'all). If you cannot decide, Jollimus will find or craft an image for you. Also, in evidence, a sixteen digit number starting at 1 (Jollimus) and working up from there. If you wish, you can even include a picture of you in the design.<br/><br/> Except the lowest ten, all Nerd Cards will be numbered in the order for which they were paid. This means, for example, if you are the very first to donate, you will receive the #11 card. If you're the first and you pick the Low Numbered Card perk, the additional four cards that come with it would be numbered 11, 12, 13, &amp; 14, no matter when they actually get made. Plain and Simple.<br/><br/>The reverse will bear up to three Nerd Facts about you (you must provide these), a security seal, a place for you to sign your name to make it 100% official, and up to 6 Nerd Badges, starting with the Fundraiser Badge for helping to make this venture possible. At this point in time, there will definitely be a Pizza Badge available to anyone who watches an episode of Jollimus Eats a Pizza and a Special Gold Pizza Badge for anyone who watched one of the first 3 episodes of Jollimus Eats A Pizza at <a href=""http://www.nerdcore.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.nerdcore.co</a> (Episode 3 airs Thursday, April 24); a Sandwich Badge, which gives the bearer an automatic 25% discount on their Nerd Card, but requires them to get Jollimus a sandwich if he asks; and a mic Badge for all you rappers out there. More badges are being planned, and you are all encouraged to bring your ideas to the table.<p></p><p></p><h3>Risks?</h3><p></p>Now, I know some of you are wondering what the risks of funding this might be. Let me lay some #JolliFacts on you. Production will likely be slow, as this is going to be a 100% JolliJob. No outsourcing, no accepting help from the neighbor kid, no unpaid interns, nobody working for the ""exposure"". There will be times when I just need to not do this. You all know how that goes. Jollimus leaves the house sometimes, and those are times when he won't be able to produce more Official Nerd Cards. If for some unforseen reason, Jollimus ceases to live, production will cease and no Official Nerd Cards shall be had ever again. There will surely be imitators, but there will only ever be one Official Nerd Card Provider, and that is Jollimus Prime.<br/><br/>There is exactly ZERO risk that I will run away with your money. I'm not the kind of person who makes promises, but when I do, I keep them. I promise you that if this gets funded, Official Nerd Cards will happen, and if we even make it to 75%, I will do my damndest to make them come about.<p></p><p></p><h3>Badges!</h3><p></p>That said, anyone who participates in the funding of this project gets not only the Fundraiser Badge, but an automatic discount on their Official Nerd Card. When sales officially begin, they will retail for 10 USD, but here in the fundraiser, I am offering them for 8 USD, with a slight discount the more you buy. What this means is, one card is $8, two are $15, three are $22, four are $29, five are $36, and so on. In that vein, during the fundraiser, a Nerd Card with a Sandwich Badge is $6. While the upper reward tiers will be geared toward cards without the Sandwich Badge, if you want one, you can pick a lower tier and mention your wish to procure the badge. Be warned, Jollimus will call you on the Sandwich Badge at some point, and it only expires when he does.<br/><br/>Any and all badges that become available for Nerd Cards will be regulated in some manner. For the Mic Badge, you have to prove you're a rapper and/or singer. For the Gold Pizza Badge, I know who showed up to watch Episodes 1 &amp; 2, and I will be keeping track of those who show up for Episode 3. There will eventually be badges reserved for groups, and if you aren't a member of said group, you won't be able to get that badge (Example: the LampedTrinity Badge, only available to the LampedGod, the LampedMufasa and the LampedBlackGuy aka Lampimus).<br/><br/>Please don't forget that the cards are limited to Six Badges. There will not be space made for more as that would sacrifice quality, and I won't stand for that.<br/><br/><br/>UPDATE: For those wanting the low numbered card, the numbers 6, 7 and 8 have been claimed.<br/><p></p></div>","Have you ever had someone question your nerdiness?

short comics, full sized illustrations, essays, and more!Coming from the Legacies Team, we aim to elevate voices from Asian & Pacific creators. For this edition, we wanted to explore the theme of CELEBRATION.  In the big things:The vivid dresses and striking suits of a young one’s coming of age ceremony. The thundering sounds of lion dancers, making their way through a Lunar New Year’s Parade. The stunning sight of a festival in full swing, colorful and bursting with life. The triumphant love of a grand wedding and the quieter ways of celebrating our dead. Feasts for miles, festivity for days. But also the little things: The blue of the waters we come from and the ones that bind us together. The vibrant color red, draped around the house and the shoulders of our elders. The sound of roaring laughter with our family gatherings. The low tonal noises of our language. The smell of food that brings us home. Memory, connection, and stories. Celebration means many things to us. It is celebrating the things that make us who we are or things that we celebrate as Asian & Pacific. It can be both.Everyone celebrates. Let us show you how we celebrate. As we hope to bring this beautifully crafted book to life, we aim to donate all the proceeds to a non-profit organization!Our current choice is Give2Asia. ""Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Give2Asia is an international nonprofit that serves as a strategic partner and ally working on the ground in more than 23 countries across the Asia Pacific.

<h3>Our Storyline</h3>
<div>
<p>In a time of enormous crisis in Greece two award winning photographers and cinematographers- Stratis Vogiatzis and Thekla Malamou – with a supportive team of artists and researchers will go on a year and a half long journey, a passage, a caravan project all around Greece. Their aim is to shed light on an inspiring Greece that continues to dream and create.  They will travel and document the austere culture in the most barren and remote parts of Greece, bring forth testimonials of people's personal experiences, and create a collection of documentary films, photographs, texts and narratives that will focus on the existence of a different way of life in Greece, one contrary to the one that the mass media chooses to constantly portray.  In all these ways, we declare that Another World Is Here.</p>
<p> </p>
<strong>Another Wold Is Here </strong>is going to incorporate the following projects:</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>I. Α series of documentary films based on </strong><strong>Â“""</strong><strong>Extraordinary People</strong>”</p>
<p> These films will reveal both the environment and unique way of life of each “extraordinary person” through their own eyes. The inner link that will connect these stories/documentaries will be the resilience of the human spirit, a passion for life, and the ability of each human being to form his or her own destiny. The first documentary that we already completed is about a blind fisherman with one hand in the village of Lagada on the island of Chios which won the won the Audience Award on the 14th International film festival in Thessaloniki </p>
<p><strong>II. A mosaic of stories</strong></p>
</div>
<div>Every person is a collection of stories and our stories are what make up our own, unique personality, from a grandmother telling a fairytale, to someone’s deepest need to tell his story in order to be understood. By asking the question “<em>Tell me the story you like to tell the most”</em>, our aim is to record accounts of people from all over Greece, creating a mosaic of stories which, in their own way, will add color to the Greek soul. Our target is to form a collection of these stories, enriched with photography and texts, so that through exhibitions and presentations we can spread the power and the meaning of the personal story.</div>
<div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>III. Documenting Remote Areas (Agoni Grami)</strong></p>
<p>The remotest areas in Greece may be isolated, but they definitely should not be forgotten since they are throbbing with stories and symbols that reveal a rough and difficult way of life. Yet at the same time, life in these areas is full of simplicity, without pretense, and in harmony with the rhythm of nature. We believe that in these forgotten corners of Greece, there lies an invaluable civilization of authenticity and a true wisdom, which has a lot to reveal about the historical identity of Greece. Οur aim is to produce a photography album based on the way of life we reveal, the houses and the landscape of Agoni Grammi, and also incorporate audiovisual material highlighting short stories of people living in these remote areas.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Our motivation, Our mission</strong></p>
<p>Greece is  portrayed in the foreign media as a country of corruption, a bankrupt country, not only economic but also political and ethical terms, a ‘lost case’ as many foreign media repsensatives call it. We would like to change this portrayal.  It is of vital importance for us to light up a side of Greece which is hidden and usually ignored by the media, to give a new lease on life to a Greece which continues to give us inspiration. Due to the disruption and isolation of the economic crisis, now, more than ever, we feel the imperative need for a fresh assessment of our country and way in which we live. It is time for a new vehicle toward education of ourcultural space - a caravan to show the Another World is here.</p>
<p> Our aim is to convey real-life stories and experiences with the utmostauthenticity so as to pass on forgotten values and re-examine the principles,which bring us closer to a more meaningful way of life. Conveying stories is the thread which is woven deep in our lives, our consciousness, our humanity. It has the power το bring understanding amongst the the most diverse peoples of the world. Since storytelling is a dialogue, shared stories create more understanding and bring people closer together as a community.</p>
<p>Along our travels, we will inform local people of our work through slideshows and discussions in the communities and village squares, thus creating an alternative method and location for education. In cooperation with cultural institutes and universities – like Panteio University and Museum of Photography in Greece - we will organize exhibitions, and slide shows in Greece and abroad, to inspire people through our work.  We will teach the value of personal story and concurrently create a multicultural arena full of information propelling people toward collaboration and participation with the work.</p>
<p>  </p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Where does the money go</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>We estimate that we need $32,000 total for production and post-production costs. These include, - Editing - Graphics  - The output and delivery of an industry standard high quality formated documentary films - Sound design and colour grade.  We expect to cover the majority of that expense through grants from private citizens and institutes in Greece. However, in order to ensure that we can deliver the complete project consisting of documentaries, photographs, and narratives, we are hoping to raise $14,000 through this Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p> To make the caravan project a reality, we need additional technical equipment, running costs and production costs. We will produce at least 6 documentaries regarding ""extraordinary people"" (around 30min length), 5 short documentaries (around 5min length) and the personal narratives as a multimedia  project. Over the span of a year and a half we will also complete the photography book of our journey.</p>
<p>We will then be able to deliver the documentary films to several broadcasters, have it premier in international film festivals and to allow it reach broad audiences worldwide, including straight to you!</p>
<p>All our incentives for your donations are listed to the right, and we thank you in advance for your support!</p>

<p>We believe that being a part of change is being a part of the most important work in the world.</p>
<p>At Art Works for Change, we create contemporary art exhibitions and innovative projects that address social justice and environmental issues across the globe. We harness the power of art to promote awareness, provoke dialogue, and inspire action.</p>
<h3>What we need:</h3>
<p>R<span>ecently, we created a new adaptation of Oware, an ancient game from Africa. Our version of Oware, called AWARE/OWARE combines storytelling, art, and gameplay to promote positive health practices and human rights in Africa. </span>In 2011, Art Works For Change debuted the game in Cape Town, South Africa, and it’s traveled throughout that country over the past year. We now have an opportunity to bring AWARE/OWARE to Senegal, in partnership with Sister Fa, the country's inspirational ""Queen of Hip Hop"" and a tireless human rights activist.</p>
<p>In Senegal, as in many countries, advances in children's health are impeded by a lack of awareness, limited resources, gender bias, and discrimination. Simply put: girls and boys don’t learn about and adopt positive health practices, and understand why they matter.</p>
<p>Through gaming, art and wordplay, AWARE/OWARE starts conversations that increase awareness of critical health issues among young people, inspiring the next generation of Senegalese to take action on malaria, HIV/AIDs, and reproductive health.</p>
<p>We're hoping to raise funds to join Sister Fa on tour in December. However, plane tickets are expensive and we’re asking for your help to get us there.</p>
<p>Your financial support will allow us to bring a 4-person team of organizers, artists and bloggers to travel with Sister Fa for one week this December. During the tour, we’ll directly engage more than 1,500 children at schools in five Senegalese cities, and leave behind the tools and techniques to keep the game and the conversation going after we're gone.</p>

From Krista Dalby, Puppeteer in Chief: As many of you know, this type of project is not new to me.  I'm a volunteer with ArtsCan Circle (www.artscancircle.ca), undertaking similar projects in remote First Nations communities, as well as teaching puppetry in local schools through the Ontario Arts Council's Artist in Education program.  I feel compelled to take my work to Ghana as the children there have limited opportunities to explore the arts, and virtually no access to art supplies.

<p>The exhibition is dedicated to aesthetic aspects of the oppression-struggling creative act: street art-vandalism, ridiculing flashmobs, clownish posed photos, parodic video clips, idiotic role games in urban environment or costume personage performance realized in Russian art for the first time in the last 30 years and reflected in the performances and video clips of Pussy Riot band. The show features such distinguished artists and art groups as Oleg Kulik, Boris Orlov, Gnezdo band, Rostislav Lebedev, Blue Noses group, Avdey Ter-Oganyan or Voina group.</p>
<p><strong>Exhibiting artists:</strong> Vika Begalskaja (RU), Blue Noses Group (RU), Alexander Brener (RU), Dmitri Bulnigin (RU), Elikuka Group (RU), E.T.I. Group (RU), Gnezdo Group (RU), Alexey Iorsh (RU), Komar a Melamid (RU), Alexander Kosolapov (RU), Oleg Kulik (RU), Rostislav Lebedev (RU), Victoria Lomasko (RU), Artem Loskutov (RU), Vladislav Mamishev Monroe (RU), Igor Mukhin (RU), Boris Orlov (RU), PG Group (RU), Pussy Riot (RU), Leonid Sokov (RU), Tcvetophory Group (RU), Voina Group (RU)</p>
<p><strong>What do we need to make this exhibition happen:</strong></p>
<p>a/ to cover the travel expenses for 3 people from Moscow and Paris to Prague and back; transportation expences for art pieces (1800 USD)</p>
<p>b/ accommodation (300 USD)</p>
<p>c/ exhibition brochure, posters and postcards, video (1000 USD)</p>
<p>d/ advertising campaign (600 USD)</p>
<p><strong>What do you get from us?</strong></p>
<p>Let us make you famous by inserting your name  into our short exhibition document (in the final subtitles).</p>
<p>Get a unique MeetFactory T-shirt or send a special postcard direct to president Putin!</p>
<p>And finally come to Prague and be our guest. Discover the creative spirit of Prague´s artistic underground! Have a delicious dinner at a restaurant owned by Václav Havel´s chef and accept an invitation from David Černý as your personal cultural guide.</p>
<p><strong>And above all your donated credit will help us to run the exhibition!</strong></p>
<p>When this exhibition begins, it will be almost a year from the performance of Pussy Riot in the Christ the Savior cathedral in Moscow. Perhaps even more interesting than the performance itself was the spectacular media coverage and attention of not only the global art world, that came right after this event and lasts until now. The Pussy Riot action and its consequences for the group members were seen from all kinds of different perspectives, from heroization through using them as a means for expressing anti-Putin statements to thinking of this move as a mere promotion of the now famous artistic and musical group. However, this act was rarely contextualized, seen a part of a larger whole.</p>
<p>The exhibition concept for Prague became larger, looking at performances and actions dating back to the 1970s, which obviously still relate to contemporary events. We are pleased to present this exhibition and would be grateful for your support.</p>
<p>We hope this exhibiton to be very attractive for Czech people and also for international visitors.The history of 40 years of suffering under the communistic regime in East Europe is still alive in our mind. From 1948 throught 1986 untill 1989, we survived and artitst were one of the most important voices of movements and changes. </p>
<p>AS VÁCLAV HAVEL SAYS: „We shouldn´t forget anyone, who have paid for our freedome in some way or other.“ WE ARE TRYING THIS EVERY DAY, WHOLE LIFE.</p>

<p>The official bio reads as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jaz Sufi is a poet, a Bay Area Native, an excavator of the human condition, and delighted to make your acquaintance. At 18, she became the slammaster of the Legendary Santa Cruz Indie Slam and the youngest slammaster of a PSI-certified venue in the country. Later that year, she assistant coached her team to place 8th at the 2011 National Poetry Slam, and in 2012 competed as part of Stockton's debut national team. At Inkslam '12, she was invited to encore on final stage after being voted by the audience as one of the festival's top performances. She was a featured poet at the 2011 USF Creative Justice Art Show, and has been invited to perform at festivals across the Bay, including San Jose's 2011/2012 SubZero Festival, San Francisco's How Weird Street Faire, and Santa Cruz's Poetry and Book Arts Extravaganza. Sometimes Jaz is sad in her poems, and that's fine, but sometimes she's not, and that's fine, too.</li>
</ul><p>This doesn't get to the heart of things, however. I went to my first slam the week after my seventeenth birthday, and six hours after yet another relapse into self-harm. I wore long sleeves. I sat in the corner. I did everything possible to be nothing -- and was randomly selected as a judge. I haven't gone two weeks without attending or competing in a slam since. I've found family I didn't even know I was missing before hearing them read. Slam taught me that it was okay to feel loud enough for an entire audience to feel it, too; that my words and my stories were valid and worth hearing; that sometimes the world listens to a single voice. The first time you step on a stage, it is impossible to ever be nothing again.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<strong>THE COMPETITION</strong>     </h2>
<p>Slam poetry is a form of competitive spoken word originating in Chicago during the '80s. Judges are chosen randomly from the audience to score each poem from 1 to 10. Poets are given a time limit (between one and four minutes, but most often three) and a few general rules -- no props, no costumes, no assaulting low-scoring judges -- and make magic from the microphone.  The poetry has always been and will always be the point, of course, but only one can win. It's basically like a friendly version of the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>The Women of the World Poetry Slam (WOWPS) is one of three national tournaments held by Poetry Slam Incorporated. Each year, up to 72 female-identified poets compete at this four day event to decide the top female poet in the nation. WOWPS 2013 will take place in Minneapolis, MN from March 6th to 10th.</p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></h2>
<p>... as always, is money. Unfortunately, Delta Airlines doesn't accept a poem and a winning smile as payment. The breakdown is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>airplane ticket = $482</li>
<li>hotel = $400</li>
<li>registration = $150</li>
<li>IndieGoGo fees = $70+</li>
<li>printing/shipping costs = $30-50</li>
</ul><p>I'm a poet, so all numbers tend to frighten me, but these numbers in particular frighten me a <em>lot</em>. As an unemployed full-time student, they're positively terrifying. I'll put myself in the poorhouse to get to WOWPS, but I'd prefer that not to be the case, particularly since I have the sneaking suspicion poorhouses don't actually exist anymore.</p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></h2>
<p>... is you! My appreciation for every single dollar is almost blinding in its size and authenticity. The perks are less an incentive to donate and more a way to show you just how grateful I am.<br/><br/>If you can't donate in dollars, a second of your time is just as valuable. Tell a friend. Tell ALL your friends. Tell an enemy. Tell ALL your enemies. Tell Facebook and Twitter and your auntie and the mailman. Minneapolis is a long, long ways away, and the more people who hear about this, the more people might be willing to toss a dollar or two my way.<br/><br/>(Here are <a href=""http://s1282.beta.photobucket.com/user/j-sufioso/library/WOWPS%202013%20Perks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">examples</a> of the perks, in case you want to see what you're in for.

<p>Since then I have been painting and exhibiting. This work played a very significant role in transforming my self, my world view, and many things around my life. During this period, I wrote a few plays and directed them.</p>
<p><span>Today I continue to paint, photograph, design, and write; and as i write this i am sitting with an intense need to make 3 films, a game, and a lot of paintings.</span></p>
<p>I am trying to raise funds for my current art projects. My wish is to fund my future projects using my past work, with the support of all who appreciate my work and would like to see more work flowing from me. It is very important for me to do it this way, since my future work will also have the will, the wish, and the blessings of all of you.</p>
<h2>My Work</h2>
<p>Though my works appear to be paintings, they are also sculptures. And is done on photographic paper that was thrown out of print labs as waste, since they were accidentally exposed to white light.

<h2>Need for funds</h2>
<p>I am primarily trying to raise seed funds for two of my future project.</p>
<p>1. <strong>""The Gift"" a film</strong> </p>
<p>2. <strong>""Journey"" a game</strong></p>
<p>To add to it I am currently also working on paintings (a series)-- ""wandering lines"" and ""riots of vision"". These projects are extremely important for me, especially the game, I believe it will change the way we tell stories..</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>My Projects</h2>
<p><strong>Story line of ""The Gift""<br/></strong>A man is going to be a father, he is obsessed with the idea of finding a unique gift for the new member, it is the story of his journey to find the gift, a story that spans 10 months of pregnancy, it is a journey through different layers of transformations</p>
<p>i would like to make this movie from your contributions.. your gifts... it is also a journey on what the state of pregnancy means for a man, and the hope of falling in love with the same person again and again.</p>
<p><strong>""Journey""<br/></strong>Is a game of life and living, the way stories are told and listened to.... i believe it will be beginning of a new paradigm for gaming<br/><br/></p>
<h3><strong>How the funds will be used ? </strong></h3>
<p>This fund will be used primarily for travel, research, art supplies and writing the Game Bible. The film and game will seek further crowd funding at different stages of its making. </p>
<p>If I am not able to raise what I wish to, the fund raised will be used to create more works and campaign again and again with new works, till i have enough to complete the projects, and part of it will also be used to contribute to other campaigns related to art, literature, and environment.<br/><br/></p>

C’est difficile dans ce milieu surtout quand tu ne passes pas par les chemins conventionnel de l’école. J’ai une chance enfin de passer de l’autre côté de la clôture. En juillet dernier ma candidature a été retenue par le SIDIM, c’est le salon international de Design de Montréal. En mai 2014, j’y serai pour me faire connaitre d’avantage ce qui me permettra d’avancer dans ma carrière d’artiste. Car mes 2 plus grands rêves sont: de faire mon métier à temps plein, fini les 2 jobs pour survivre, l’autre c’est d’exposer au Musée des arts contemporain de Montréal mon projet qui se nomme NORMAL. Je vous en reparle en temps et lieu celui-là c’est du long terme et c'est le retour sur les bancs de l'université avant.</font></span></b></p><p></p><p></p>

Un peu sur moi!
Bonjour! Mon nom est Nadia Guillemette, je suis une artiste peintre impressionniste abstraite de 41 ans. Je vis à la campagne avec mon homme Patrick et mon chat Charlie au Canada. Je suis frisée comme un mouton et passionnée de la vie. J’ai toujours été artiste, depuis toute petite, crayons, pinceaux, peintures était mes meilleurs amis du monde.  
Depuis 4 ans, je trime dure pour me faire reconnaitre de mes paires. C’est difficile dans ce milieu surtout quand tu ne passes pas par les chemins conventionnel de l’école. J’ai une chance enfin de passer de l’autre côté de la clôture. En juillet dernier ma candidature a été retenue par le SIDIM, c’est le salon international de Design de Montréal. En mai 2014, j’y serai pour me faire connaitre d’avantage ce qui me permettra d’avancer dans ma carrière d’artiste. Car mes 2 plus grands rêves sont: de faire mon métier à temps plein, fini les 2 jobs pour survivre, l’autre c’est d’exposer au Musée des arts contemporain de Montréal mon projet qui se nomme NORMAL. Je vous en reparle en temps et lieu celui-là c’est du long terme et c'est le retour sur les bancs de l'université avant.
A little bit about MOI!
Hi! Thanks for taking the time to read about me.  My name is Nadia Guillemette, I'm an impressionist abstract painter of 41 years young.  I live in the country with my partner Patrick and our cat Charlie in Canada.
 I have crazy curly hair and passionate about life.  I have been an artiste all my life, little, my best friends were the jars of paint, some crayons and a brush.
It’s been 4 years now that I have been working very hard to get recognized by my peers. In this career it’s hard, very hard even more so when you don't go through the conventional path of school. Next may 2014 I will have a great opportunity to meet my peers, designer, buyer etc.  I was chosen to do the International design show in Montreal called SIDIM.  This is going to help me get where I want to go in life. The first: stop working two jobs and concentrate on just one, which is painting. Then the other one is to get a show at the Montreal museum of contemporary art for my project call NORMAL but that is a whole new story as I will have to go back to university first.

Comment ça sera dépensé. How I'm going to spend this
 
Porte folio
Je vais engager un photographe professionnel pour prendre mes œuvres en photo. Je vais pouvoir me servir de ça, afin de  les montrer en continue sur un laptop Asus Tablette que je dois acheter, durant les 4 jours et faire aussi un catalogue que je remettrais en cadeau pour ceux qui ferons une donations de 25$ et plus.
I will get a professional photographer to take pictures of my art. So I can make a video that will be shown on a laptop Asus Tablet that I have to buy, for the 4 days and I will print a catalogue that will be given to anybody who will give a donation of $25 or more.
Transport
Location d’un mini van pour apporter mes œuvres au Studio et au Salon. Je travaille sur du gros format 4x3 pied et plus. Mes œuvres ne rentrent pas dans ma voiture, du moins pas toutes.
Leasing of a mini-van for the transport of the art, to and from the event. Unfortunately I work on large format of 4 x 3 feet canvas and they just don't fit in my car.
Kiosque
Va m'aider à payer le stand 3000.00$ +tx. 
Will help me pay for the stand. It's 3000$ +tx. 
Matériel bruts et location d’espace de travail. Studio rental and materiels
Malheureusement mon atelier n’est pas chauffé alors je ne travaille pas l’hiver. J’aimerais continuer ma production pour cet évènement. Alors je dois louer un local et c'est dispendieux, en moyenne 1200.00$ par mois.  Tout le matériel que j'ai besoin, lame pour couper les palettes, marteau, clou, peintures, montant etc...
Unfortunately my studio is not heated for winter so I cannot work from November to May.  Since I have to work this winter to be ready for the show, I will have to rent a heated studio for 4 months and also buy all the material I need for my work
Un don= un cadeau
One donation= One gift
Vous avez toute ma gratitude, ce projet serait beaucoup plus difficile sans vous, il va se faire pareille c’est certain,  mais je vais être obligée de faire une ou deux soirée spaghetti.
Chaque don sera honoré par un cadeau : une carte de souhait, une carte postale authentique, une toile 5x7, 8x10 ou 11x14 pouces ou une toile de 4 x 3 pieds etc… c’est le montant de votre don qui déterminera le cadeau qui vous sera remis durant l’année 2014.
 
First and for most THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. You have all of my gratitude. Every donation will be honored by a gift. From a simple hand maid card, or a mail art postcard to a 5x7’’, 8x10’, or a 11x14’, even a 4 x 3 feet original work of art.  Your donation will determine the gift. 
Comment vous pouvez m’aider en un simple click.
1. Investir à mon projet.
2. Partager mon projet partout, partout, partout avec tout le monde.
Il est dit dans la vie que ça prend un village pour élever un enfant. Soyez mon village.
How can you help me with a simple click.

<p>What's the Project?</p>
</div>
<div>The SteamPunk Festival will bring a fun-packed creative event, celebrating all forms of arts. Steam punk is a literary genre - a multidimensional view of the world.  It is past, present, and future. It is romantic, yet, it is science, history, literature and art. It is time travel and about invention - out of the box industrial. The clothing is the-late-1800’s-meets-the-future.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have chosen this theme to celebrate Cite de Arts’ 10th anniversary because Steampunk showcases such a broad spectrum of creative activity. We plan on having music, art, juggling, magic, puppets, tarot readings, old tintype photography, tattoo art, stilt walkers, a fashion show, and much more. In the evening, the musical ""Cabaret"" will be in our main theatre with a live band. We like to think the future of Cite Des Arts is much like SteamPunk with all of the creativity - the inventions, bells &amp; whistles and frills. We hope to pull together our community's family of artists to create a festival this year and into the future that surpasses anything that Lafayette has seen.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What's the money for?</div>
<div>
<br/>The day-long festival is set to feature indoor and outdoor activities. We are looking to raise a total of $5050 and your financial contribution will ensure the success of the festival by assisting Cité des Arts to close down Vine Street, set up a stage and tents, host a couple bands and create a street fair/festival atmosphere with secure places for vendors and sideshows - pay for printing, the permit to close off Vine Street and for official city traffic barriers, an outdoor stage and a professional sound setup, and outdoor tents. And, we want to pay all the professional artists who are working for the festival.</div>

<div>As a 501(c)3 non-profit, connumity-based organization, transparency is one of our core values and our financial statements are maintained by and available from our board of directors.  Our SteamPunk Festival is a community-led, non-profit project, and all contributions are made on a voluntary basis and each contributor is regarded as an integral part of the festival.

<p style=""font-size: 14px;""><em><strong>Update: New Eternal Return Build Timeline &amp; Announcement for Burning Man 2013</strong></em></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3ACwEhzJyg&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://hudzodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hudzovideo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<div>
<p><em>We are eager to share the very latest developments with Eternal Return! This is Peter’s most ambitious stroboscopic zoetrope to date, and it has become clear that it is not possible to realize Peter’s vision with just over four months to go until this year’s burn. </em></p>
<p><em>Burning Man has offered us an alternative, they have provided a generous grant to bring back multiple pieces in 2013! This is a great opportunity to catch one of your old favorites or see one you may have missed in years passed. This will enable us to bring Eternal Return to it’s full potential in time for Burning Man 2014. We are very grateful for the additional time to produce this unique, inspiring and complex piece and look forward to having your ongoing support as we continue on our journey</em></p>
<p><em>I</em><em>n the meantime, we must remain full-steam ahead on the production of Eternal Return and continue our volunteer and fundraising efforts with great momentum. All donations made to this campaign will still go to the build of Eternal Return. We are working not only to meet, but to surpass our Eternal Return Indiegogo fundraising goal. Your contributions thus far have been crucial and we could not be more grateful for your generous donations, countless volunteer hours and continued support. We are thrilled to be able to provide you with two successive years of phenomenal art in return!</em></p>
<p><em><span>**A couple changes to a few of the rewards: <br/>The face casting can be done anytime between May 1, 2013 and Mid-summer 2014. Since Peter will be bringing zoetropes out to the playa in 2013 and 2014, the camp party package will now include an invite for two to both the 2013 and 2014 events. Ditto for the exclusive preview party. All other rewards remain the same.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span> </span></em></p>
</div>
<p style=""font-size: 14px;"">Zoetropes are remarkably qualified to portray the cyclical nature of life. A zoetrope is a cylindrical device that produces the illusion of motion from a rapid succession of static pictures. Instead of drawings and shutters, I use sculptures and strobe lights to achieve the same effect.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 14px;"">Earlier works have focused on darker themes, the Sisyphean drudgery of repetitive, never-ending punishment.  In contrast, Eternal Return celebrates the joy and ecstasy of life, not just repeated, but begun anew. </p>
<p style=""font-size: 14px;"">The concept of the Eternal Return speculates that the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form, an infinite number of times across infinite time and space. This concept is touched upon in virtually all cultural and religious narratives.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 14px;""><span>I have been blessed with the opportunity to realize some of my wildest fantasies. And I’d like to have you be part of the next fantasy. Trust me, if you've liked my earlier works, You'll love Eternal Return!</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 14px;"">Burning Man has awarded us a very generous grant. However, we still need to raise $40,000 to realize this ambitious design. The creative process begins with the vision of the artist but requires the hands, hearts, and support of a dedicated community to transition from the drawing board to a fully immersive experience.

Update: New Eternal Return Build Timeline & Announcement for Burning Man 2013


We are eager to share the very latest developments with Eternal Return! This is Peter’s most ambitious stroboscopic zoetrope to date, and it has become clear that it is not possible to realize Peter’s vision with just over four months to go until this year’s burn. 
Burning Man has offered us an alternative, they have provided a generous grant to bring back multiple pieces in 2013! This is a great opportunity to catch one of your old favorites or see one you may have missed in years passed. This will enable us to bring Eternal Return to it’s full potential in time for Burning Man 2014. We are very grateful for the additional time to produce this unique, inspiring and complex piece and look forward to having your ongoing support as we continue on our journey
In the meantime, we must remain full-steam ahead on the production of Eternal Return and continue our volunteer and fundraising efforts with great momentum. All donations made to this campaign will still go to the build of Eternal Return. We are working not only to meet, but to surpass our Eternal Return Indiegogo fundraising goal. Your contributions thus far have been crucial and we could not be more grateful for your generous donations, countless volunteer hours and continued support. We are thrilled to be able to provide you with two successive years of phenomenal art in return!
**A couple changes to a few of the rewards: The face casting can be done anytime between May 1, 2013 and Mid-summer 2014. Since Peter will be bringing zoetropes out to the playa in 2013 and 2014, the camp party package will now include an invite for two to both the 2013 and 2014 events. Ditto for the exclusive preview party. All other rewards remain the same.
 

Zoetropes are remarkably qualified to portray the cyclical nature of life. A zoetrope is a cylindrical device that produces the illusion of motion from a rapid succession of static pictures. Instead of drawings and shutters, I use sculptures and strobe lights to achieve the same effect.
Earlier works have focused on darker themes, the Sisyphean drudgery of repetitive, never-ending punishment.  In contrast, Eternal Return celebrates the joy and ecstasy of life, not just repeated, but begun anew. 
The concept of the Eternal Return speculates that the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form, an infinite number of times across infinite time and space. This concept is touched upon in virtually all cultural and religious narratives.
I have been blessed with the opportunity to realize some of my wildest fantasies. And I’d like to have you be part of the next fantasy. Trust me, if you've liked my earlier works, You'll love Eternal Return!
Burning Man has awarded us a very generous grant. However, we still need to raise $40,000 to realize this ambitious design. The creative process begins with the vision of the artist but requires the hands, hearts, and support of a dedicated community to transition from the drawing board to a fully immersive experience. We would be honored if you participated in making this a reality. Your early contributions are essential to the success of Eternal Return.
Thank you very much for your support,

15-65, came together during a 16-week period to engage in Durham’s Civil Rights History through a series of lectures, music performances, research and design workshops. The group then gathered </span><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial;"">what they discovered into a collaborative mural design.</span><font size=""5""><span style=""line-height: 30px;""> </span></font><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.45em;"">In late May-July 2014

painful past and addressing present issues of race and class in a city that is a
state of transition and gentrification. These stories will emerge from the design of the mural and
the final ""story"" will go beyond the mural itself into the lives of
the characters who participate in this creative process. The documentary material will also be the cornerstone of our educational outreach materials we intend to create to help bring this story and process to other communities in the South.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial;""></span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/514173/files/20140416214717-workshop11.jpg?1397710037"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial;"">Please

Beginning in 2013, 30 diverse community members, ages
15-65, came together during a 16-week period to engage in Durham’s Civil Rights History through a series of lectures, music performances, research and design workshops. The group then gathered what they discovered into a collaborative mural design. In late May-July 2014
these same folks, with the help of the greater community, will paint this 2400 square foot mural in downtown Durham, under the direction of muralist Brenda
Miller Holmes. Arising from this process is a multimedia, multi platform educational outreach project directed by award-winning documentary filmmaker Rodrigo Dorfman. The stories documented will be personal and thematic, reflecting a
painful past and addressing present issues of race and class in a city that is a
state of transition and gentrification. These stories will emerge from the design of the mural and
the final ""story"" will go beyond the mural itself into the lives of
the characters who participate in this creative process. The documentary material will also be the cornerstone of our educational outreach materials we intend to create to help bring this story and process to other communities in the South.Please
join us and contribute to keep this inspiring history alive and honor the
sacrifices of the many Durham citizens who fought for equity and justice.  WHAT WE NEED AND WHY



In 2012, our project was selected by the
City of Durham, for its first public art pilot program, and we received a
generous grant that covered 80% of the initial cost of the mural. Since then,
the size of the wall has grown 300%. Our 800 square foot wall is now a 2400 square foot wall! Can you picture that? The mural will be located on the rear wall of the Durham Visitors and Convention Center facing Morris Street, next to Durham Arts Council.While we are really excited about
the new downtown location and expanded space, we need more of everything. More
paint,  more brushes, more scaffolding…you
name it. We also realize the importance of building on this project and
reaching as many people as possible about Durham’s profound Civil Rights
History, so we are working on a multimedia project to engage community with the
history in multiple ways. We need your help! First and foremost, we need $7000
to finish the mural. 2400 square feet is a lot of additional space so we
require a lot of additional materials, not to mention insurance and expanded
scaffolding. We also need $3000 to complete the first documentary phase of our multimedia educational project, which involves filming the creation of the mural and interviewing five participants. The second phase will consist of putting together a short documentary, a booklet and an interactive website.  And finally,
we need you! Community is central to making this project a reality. Please
check out our perks, become an honored sponsor, and donate what you can. WHY WE NEED THIS WALLOur hope for the project is to honor the unsung
heroes, while taking a longer view. History is often presented in one top-down
dimension that honors leaders and ignores the tremendous efforts of everyday
people. Our desire is to depict a fuller history, celebrating the hundreds of
Durham Citizens whose feet were on the ground working and to commemorate the
incredible sacrifices that they made to create change. I also believe that
sharing this history is just as important for looking forward as it is for looking
back. Understanding the power of each person’s contribution to collective
effort has the potential to inspire new movement as we continue to strive for
justice.    GET INVOLVED
“The success of the movement was due to the wisdom of the elders and the impatience of the youth” Mickey Michaux - North Carolina General AssemblyJhordan Perry, Senator Floyd B. McKissick, Jr.  Dr. Charmaine McKissick-Melton
We also need your time and good humor!  We are inviting the greater community to come and paint with us. Don’t consider
yourself an artist? Don’t worry about that, bring your good energy and
contribute to this historic public artwork. If this sounds like fun (it is!),
please reach out to brenda(at)brendamillerholmes.com
and dates will be announced. Also, share this campaign via email and social
networks. Spread the word and pick up a paint brush. You will not regret it. MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT


Funded by the City of Durham, through an
initiative of the Durham Cultural Advisory Board, under Durham’s Cultural
Master Plan, with additional sponsorship by the Hayti Heritage Center, a
diverse group of 30 community members, fifteen youth and fifteen adults, have
come together to learn about Durham’s profound Civil Rights History. The
project began with a series of educational lectures led by Dr. Benjamin Speller
as the education team leader. Dr. Speller served as the Dean of the School of
Library and Information Sciences at North Carolina Central University (NCCU)
from 1983-2004, is a scholar of Durham Civil Rights History and served as the
president of Preservation Durham from 2000-2004. He gathered an incredible
teaching team, including North Carolina General Assembly Representative, Mickey
Michaux, Executive Director of the Pauli Murray Project, Barbara Lau,
Coordinator of University Archives/Instructor of Public History, NCCU, Andre
Vann, veteran Civil Rights activist Vivian McCoy, North
Carolina Senator Floyd B. McKissick and Department Chair, Mass Communications
at NCCU Dr. Charmiane McKissick-Melton. Held in February and March of 2013 at
the Hayti Heritage Center, this series was free and open to the public. Following
these lectures the participants engaged in additional research and collaborated
to create a cohesive mural design under the direction of muralist Brenda Miller
Holmes.     Brenda
Miller Holmes is a muralist and art educator that has facilitated collaborative
community mural projects throughout the San Francisco Bay Area and
internationally and she studied and worked with Master Muralist Susan Cervantes
of Precita Eyes Muralists from 2005-2011. Trained in an artistic approach
mirroring that of popular education, Brenda’s interest lies at the intersection
of art, activism, community empowerment and social justice. She now lives and
works in Durham, NC and is passionate about sharing this
unifying collaborative creative experience. Beyond mural making, her art
teaching experience spans a variety of media and she has led workshops with
people of all ages, from toddlers through adults. Check her out at http://www.brendamillerholmes.com Rodrigo Dorfman is an award winning

This is a small scale project to allow me to create these extra zombie designs to compliment my current designs.



I have 12 zombie themed art nouveau pieces, divided into 2 sets of 6, already designed and printed, but I'd love to add 4 more designs to each set.  I'll be working on these extra designs whilst the campaign is running and will be posting updates.
This campaign is to cover some of the printing costs for these extra designs, as well as to pay for my time in creating them.

this year the final destination of the <b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/templeofpromise"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Temple 2015</a> </b>is an homage to the healing power
of <b>TREES</b>: “The curving space tapers
to a final archway of 10 by 7 feet, elegantly opening into the contemplative
altar and the heart of this Temple: <b>a</b> <b>grove
of three sculpted TREES </b>with overlapping canopies that reach around 15 feet
high. The branches are initially bare and participants can write messages on
long strips of cloth and attach them to each tree, creating the gentle shade of
Weeping Willows <i>with each day.”</i><br/></p>Over the years, there has been a reoccurring theme of
tree-inspired art at Burning Man including<b> </b>this year's<b> </b>Honorariums<b> </b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/templeofpromise"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Temple of Promise</a>, <a href=""http://burningman.org/event/brc/2015-art-installations/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arbour</a>, <a href=""http://burningman.org/event/brc/2015-art-installations/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bone Tree</a>, <a href=""http://burningman.org/event/brc/2015-art-installations/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Infinity Tree</a>, <a href=""http://burningman.org/event/brc/2015-art-installations/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kinetic Forest</a> and in previous years the<a href=""http://burningman.org/culture/history/brc-history/afterburn/07-2/art/artofbrc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Mangrove</a>, <a href=""http://www.kateraudenbush.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Futures Past</a>,  <a href=""http://fivetoncrane.org/projects/the-nautilus/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steampunk Tree House</a>, <a href=""http://www.charlesgadeken.com/art/helix"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HELIX</a> – not to

<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437082692/tjdxzastq326k0y8m9eq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This year’s Temple Builders, <b>The Dreamers Guild,</b> have
committed to help replace the wood that the Temple of Promise will burn.  We asked tree experts for assistance with
calculations on the number of replacement trees by converting the weight of construction
lumber into board feet of lumber. A board foot is a standard measure of the
usable wood in a tree. You can picture a board foot as a piece of lumber
one-inch thick, one foot wide, and one foot long (1"" x 12"" x
12""). With adjustments for mortality, age at harvest, growing site quality and other
variables  (water, disease, insects,
competition for sunlight, etc.), in 2013 we calculated that we needed to re-plant about 1,000 seedlings to replenish the Temple wood.  We have used this calculation as a baseline for each year.  So
this year’s Art for Tree’s overall $7,000 fundraising goal is two-fold: <b>1.</b> gift
funds towards construction costs to help build the Temple of Promise as well as; <b>2.</b> raise
funds to help plant trees to replenish the wood that the Temple consumes. Both
objectives are symbiotic and serve our community to the fullest. If
we raise more than $7,000, of course we can donate even more towards construction
costs for the Temple of Promise as well as replant additional trees to replenish the
wood consumed from all the artwork that will be engulfed in flames at Burning Man.<br/><br/>
<p><b><i>Leaving a POSITIVE Trace:</i>  </b>By replacing renewable resources that we
consciously consume, we are
expanding our cultural ethos and leaving a tangible legacy.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437083924/bem3xhwaul9rowpxs0us.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>At this point, <b><a href=""http://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The 10 Principles of Burning Man</a></b> are hard-coded into
our community’s collective consciousness – especially the concept of <b>Leaving NO
Trace</b> – as in detritus pre/during/post event and limiting our overall carbon
footprint getting to and from Black Rock City. But the Yin to that Yang would be to literally
and figuratively germinate resources and ideas from our participation. This forward-looking
intention – <i><b>simply replanting trees after they are consumed</b></i> –  helps resolve
conflicts about igniting treasured resources by honoring the regeneration cycle
mirrored in nature. Combined, our uncomplicated efforts to plant seedlings year
over year will leave a positive legacy as our newly planted <b><a href=""http://temple2013.tumblr.com/post/94745433691/art-for-trees"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Burning Man Tree Groves</a></b> in

<p><b><i>Art for Trees Mission Statement:</i></b>  The Art for Trees project is a
tribute to Trees and develops awareness-based initiatives in order safeguard
their plenitude. We want to insure that future Burning Man artists will have
access to wood simply by replenishing what we use. Wood is an essential
building material and integral to most playa-based art projects - from framing
canvases for paintings to building camps and shade to the underlying
architecture of many large scale installations. Whether art burns or not is

8/19/15 - FINAL 24 HOURS to donate! EVERY DOLLAR donated during these last 24 hours will be DOUBLED
(we have a matching donor). UPDATED Stretch Goal $8,500
UPDATE
8/16/15 - Great News! Art for Trees found a generous donor that
will double our contributions by matching what we raise NOW! So your $20 donation is actually $40, your $50 will become $100, and so on. If we bring in another $5,000 in these next 3 DAYS we will in fact raise a total of $10,000 –
that means $5,000 to help build the Temple of Promise and $5,000 towards
planting trees!
Great News
#2: Attention Jewelry of Burning Man lovers - donate $250 or higher and
you will be sent this limited edition Temple 2015 Medallion (see photo below). Intricately
hand-crafted by master jeweler Tzipora Hoynik out of hand-poured metal with a
wooden inlaid, bas-relief laser carved Tree by Keelan made from wood used to build the Temple.  This 2 inch in
diameter, 1.7 ounce collectible is signed and numbered. Only 100 were made in
the first run and they are all gone but the artist is making an additional 25 for Art
for Trees (and right now there are only 10 left). LAST CHANCE – to own this
treasure so please respond soon by making a donation – or increasing the donation
you already made - before midnight Wednesday August 19th
(fulfillment will be after Burning Man due to the timing).


Art for Trees – Burning Man 2015:  It’s year three for Art for
Trees! Through our collective efforts with fundraising for Temple for Trees (2013) and Art for Trees (2014), our community has rallied to plant
over 5,100 seedling trees to replenish a portion of the wood we burned at Burning Man over the past two years. 

The Temple at Burning Man 2015, The Temple of Promise:  Poetically,
this year the final destination of the Temple 2015 is an homage to the healing power
of TREES: “The curving space tapers
to a final archway of 10 by 7 feet, elegantly opening into the contemplative
altar and the heart of this Temple: a grove
of three sculpted TREES with overlapping canopies that reach around 15 feet
high. The branches are initially bare and participants can write messages on
long strips of cloth and attach them to each tree, creating the gentle shade of
Weeping Willows with each day.”Over the years, there has been a reoccurring theme of
tree-inspired art at Burning Man including this year's Honorariums The Temple of Promise, Arbour, Bone Tree, The Infinity Tree, Kinetic Forest and in previous years the Mangrove, Futures Past,  Steampunk Tree House, HELIX – not to
mention the plethora of art built from trees – that demonstrate our deep
connection to timber. Art for Trees builds upon Burning Man’s 2007 Green Man
theme, which expressed artists’ desires to recognize “the immanence of nature in our lives.”
This year’s Temple Builders, The Dreamers Guild, have
committed to help replace the wood that the Temple of Promise will burn.  We asked tree experts for assistance with
calculations on the number of replacement trees by converting the weight of construction
lumber into board feet of lumber. A board foot is a standard measure of the
usable wood in a tree. You can picture a board foot as a piece of lumber
one-inch thick, one foot wide, and one foot long (1"" x 12"" x
12""). With adjustments for mortality, age at harvest, growing site quality and other
variables  (water, disease, insects,
competition for sunlight, etc.), in 2013 we calculated that we needed to re-plant about 1,000 seedlings to replenish the Temple wood.  We have used this calculation as a baseline for each year.  So
this year’s Art for Tree’s overall $7,000 fundraising goal is two-fold: 1. gift
funds towards construction costs to help build the Temple of Promise as well as; 2. raise
funds to help plant trees to replenish the wood that the Temple consumes. Both
objectives are symbiotic and serve our community to the fullest. If
we raise more than $7,000, of course we can donate even more towards construction
costs for the Temple of Promise as well as replant additional trees to replenish the
wood consumed from all the artwork that will be engulfed in flames at Burning Man.
Leaving a POSITIVE Trace:  By replacing renewable resources that we
consciously consume, we are
expanding our cultural ethos and leaving a tangible legacy.

At this point, The 10 Principles of Burning Man are hard-coded into
our community’s collective consciousness – especially the concept of Leaving NO
Trace – as in detritus pre/during/post event and limiting our overall carbon
footprint getting to and from Black Rock City. But the Yin to that Yang would be to literally
and figuratively germinate resources and ideas from our participation. This forward-looking
intention – simply replanting trees after they are consumed –  helps resolve
conflicts about igniting treasured resources by honoring the regeneration cycle
mirrored in nature. Combined, our uncomplicated efforts to plant seedlings year
over year will leave a positive legacy as our newly planted Burning Man Tree Groves in
Appalachia and the Stanislaus National Forest demonstrate.
Art for Trees Mission Statement:  The Art for Trees project is a
tribute to Trees and develops awareness-based initiatives in order safeguard
their plenitude. We want to insure that future Burning Man artists will have
access to wood simply by replenishing what we use. Wood is an essential
building material and integral to most playa-based art projects - from framing
canvases for paintings to building camps and shade to the underlying
architecture of many large scale installations. Whether art burns or not is
almost irrelevant since harvested wood is still consumed on many levels to
support our composite visions. Lumber is a natural resource that is renewable
and our community’s Leave No Trace ethos logically expands to support measures
to protect our planet’s gifts.

<p>My name is Amanda Brown. I am a working artist living in Chicago. After a break from my painting practice since graduating from the School of Art institute of Chicago, I have returned to the brush, palette and canvas. Over the last year I worked hard, making regular time in my studio and investing faith in my own eyes and hands, to rebuild a relationship with my work.

<p>Foundation Obras is an artist residency located in the countryside of Portugal, between Estremoz and Evora.

<p> For the month of August, I will utilize my stay to create a series of paintings that depend on the direct interaction of the local landscape.

What We Need  Our goal of $4000 will help us:-pay performers-pay stage crew-build stages-provide artist materials   The Impact The WSAF wild bring attention to the arts with public celebrations reminiscent of a traveling carnival. Throughout the nine day festival, musicians and dancers will perform in unassuming venues such as local farms and fields; artwork, spanning a combination of mediums, will be exhibited at local businesses. WSAF will collaborate with many local businesses and organizations. Many of these collaborators will assist by offering space, presenting the farmland and parks for musical, dance and literary performances throughout the festival.    Risks & ChallengesDue to the nature of our mostly outdoor community festival, we have come to expect the unexpected. Each festival brings on new unforeseeable challenges. Past challenges have included:-relocation due to inclement weather-electrical & technical outages-staff shortage-budget constraints.. and our personal favorite, the bat that got trapped in the theater during tech rehearsal.       Other Ways You Can Help -Spread the word on social media!

<h3><b>What We Are Doing:</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Seven Texas photographers are collaborating on a group exhibition of photographs made with film cameras and printed in the darkroom.  The photographers are established artists who choose to work with film and the darkroom for all or much of their work.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our purpose is to highlight the richness and diversity of images created using film and darkroom processes, in the hopes of building a community of film photographers in the North Texas area.  We know through informal associations, internet and social media groups, etc., that there are hundreds of photographers in the area that use film on a regular basis.  Eventually, we hope to have an active, established group that will be able to produce two exhibitions annually, such as an open membership show and a selective, juried show.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We expect that once a group is established, future exhibitions will be self-financing.  However, in the meantime, we need to be successful with this first exhibition, to show that it can be done, and this is where you can help.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
</div><p>Each of the photographers in this show will, of course, finance the creation of their own work.  However, there are production expenses in mounting any exhibition that are unavoidable.  Quality exhibition venues are generally not free and often galleries look for a prior history of success in order to allocate space to an artist or a group.<br/></p>

<h3>Filling a Niche in Savannah's Creative Community</h3>
<p>Over the past several years the creative community in
Savannah has grown in leaps and bounds. 
With organizations like ArtRise and the Creative Coast lending their
expertise and encouragement, many local creative businesses have started and
thrived, especially in the area South of Forsyth Park.  There is one niche that has not been filled
however: inexpensive artist workspaces comprised of a community of makers. 
That is the role Sulfur Studios aims to fill.  Our vision is to create a vibrant and
supportive environment for Savannah’s creative community, which will help
encourage talented and energetic individuals to settle in our beautiful city.</p>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>We have a great opportunity to make a collaborative and supportive art space in the  Starland/SoFo neighborhood that will meet the needs
of Savannah’s creative community.  The proposed space is a nearly 5,000sqft building located just a few blocks from many other local, creative businesses, such as Graveface Records, Back in the Day Bakery,
Gypsy Girl Vintage, Fresh Exhibitions, Obscura Photoworks,  Urban Poppy and many more.  </p>

<p>Sulfur also has symbolic connections to the human soul and

be able to secure it for our purposes. BUT...</p>
<p>We strongly believe that Savannah needs a collaborative

It was difficult to write as asking for help is not something that I was comfortable doing, but yet this is where I am at “I need help”.<br/>        I am a wife to my husband and a mother of twin three year olds and we all live in beautiful Calgary, Alberta of Canada. I have a career that I love and am passionate about and worked really hard to build. We originally came from Romania and have moved to Canada. I graduated in Europe, Romania from <em>En Vogue Aesthetic Studio</em> as make up artistry, and so when I moved to Calgary it was many hours of working for free or little to build contacts, networks, and a client base for my business to create earnings.<br/>             On June 20<sup>th</sup>, I was settling the boys in for their afternoon nap when the fire alarm went off. I packed them downstairs in their pajamas to find out what was happening. I saw many with suitcases and yet I still didn’t understand what was happening. When they told us that we needed to evacuate the apartment building, I told them that I was going to get my vehicle, which was underground parked to which they responded that it was already submersed in water. My heart sank, as all of my business was in the car’s trunk, my artistry kit, hair tools, my hours of work, my savings to build up the kit, and my income. It was all in there. I know that we are safe and I am thankful of that, and yet I am worried for how I am going to start again. I finally got to the place in my career that I need to be, and now my supplies and tools are lost.<br/>             We do not know when we are going to be allowed to return to the apartment to rebuild, and have found out that the insurance will help us with our vehicle but not the chairs, and they are already trying to give us hard time. Also they are not covering my business supplies, which is estimated at $4500 and up. I have jobs coming up, and really want to be there for the people that depend on me.</p>
<p>            Here in Calgary, we are trying to help each other how we can now after the flood disaster.  If we all come together, any contribution will help, $1, $5 , $20, or whatever you have on your heart so I can rebuild what I lost in terms of business supplies, artistry kit, my job. Or simply share my story to others would mean a lot to me.</p>
<p>            You can find out more of my work, passion and the person beneath the makeup by visiting my Facebook page below. Also you can check the gallery for details about damages and flood. Help me start again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>      Thank you for taking the time to read, just hearing my story means a lot to me.</p>

It was difficult to write as asking for help is not something that I was comfortable doing, but yet this is where I am at “I need help”.        I am a wife to my husband and a mother of twin three year olds and we all live in beautiful Calgary, Alberta of Canada. I have a career that I love and am passionate about and worked really hard to build. We originally came from Romania and have moved to Canada. I graduated in Europe, Romania from En Vogue Aesthetic Studio as make up artistry, and so when I moved to Calgary it was many hours of working for free or little to build contacts, networks, and a client base for my business to create earnings.             On June 20th, I was settling the boys in for their afternoon nap when the fire alarm went off. I packed them downstairs in their pajamas to find out what was happening. I saw many with suitcases and yet I still didn’t understand what was happening. When they told us that we needed to evacuate the apartment building, I told them that I was going to get my vehicle, which was underground parked to which they responded that it was already submersed in water. My heart sank, as all of my business was in the car’s trunk, my artistry kit, hair tools, my hours of work, my savings to build up the kit, and my income. It was all in there. I know that we are safe and I am thankful of that, and yet I am worried for how I am going to start again. I finally got to the place in my career that I need to be, and now my supplies and tools are lost.             We do not know when we are going to be allowed to return to the apartment to rebuild, and have found out that the insurance will help us with our vehicle but not the chairs, and they are already trying to give us hard time. Also they are not covering my business supplies, which is estimated at $4500 and up. I have jobs coming up, and really want to be there for the people that depend on me.
            Here in Calgary, we are trying to help each other how we can now after the flood disaster.  If we all come together, any contribution will help, $1, $5 , $20, or whatever you have on your heart so I can rebuild what I lost in terms of business supplies, artistry kit, my job. Or simply share my story to others would mean a lot to me.
            You can find out more of my work, passion and the person beneath the makeup by visiting my Facebook page below. Also you can check the gallery for details about damages and flood. Help me start again.
 
      Thank you for taking the time to read, just hearing my story means a lot to me.

<strong>OPS-- The Organization for Prostitution Survivors-- is a grassroots non-profit that was started by survivors and their allies to stop the violence of prostitution. OPS works in three program areas: survivor services, community education, and men's accountability. By leading the community in healing the harm of prostitution, OPS will shift the social norms that support the practice of prostitution. OPS is both a social service agency and an agent of social change.</strong>                                  </h3>

<p><strong>Who are the Green River Victims?</strong>                                                                                         </p>
<p>More than 90 prostituted women and girls are presumed murdered by Gary Ridgway between 1981 and his arrest in 2001 in the Seattle area. He was charged with killing 49 identified victims <em>more than half of whom were under the age of 18</em>, and admitted to killing more that were never found or identified. </p>
<p><strong>Why create a memorial for the victims of the Green River Killer?</strong>                                           </p>
<p>This tragedy has gone unacknowledged for too long. Until the families of victims and survivors have experienced healing from these murders, our community as a whole cannot begin to heal. We must address the violence of prostitution that continues all around us. These victims deserve to be acknowledged!</p>
<p> People often excuse the violence done to women and children in the life of prostitution as if they were asking for it or somehow brought it upon themselves. This attitude is similar to how people often think about women who experience domestic violence, rape, and sexual harassment and is known as victim blaming. The Green River Victims Memorial will help dispel the myths about prostitution that make blaming the victim so prevalent, and provide a place for future generations to learn from our painful past.</p>
<p><strong>What is Phase One for the Green River Victims Memorial?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phase One is about coming together through participatory art to create dialogue about the memorializing process in order to heal from this tragedy. </strong>From January 2013 until January of 2014, OPS will organize art workshops 3 times a week for survivors of prostitution for the full year. Workshops will be led by local artists in Seattle and will include opportunities in multiple media for survivors to engage with art in the healing process. OPS will also invite families of victims to participate alongside survivors in this process of restoration and active memorializing.</p>
<p><strong>Phase Two will be the completion of the memorial.</strong>  In the first phase of this project we will NOT be constructing the physical public memorial.The form and location of the physical memorial is to be determined during phase 2. These decisions will grow from thePhase One workshops, gallery shows, and presentations to stakeholders in the community as we build support for the permanent memorial.. Phase One will produce a documentary video and an art book of images that will be included in the development plans for the permanent memorial. Physical copies of these will be available as perks for backers.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it so important that we work with current survivors to do this memorial project?  </strong></p>
<p>OPS believes that giving voice to survivors <em>must </em>be the drive for this memorial project. Through these experiences and healing via creative arts, survivors take on the lead role, guiding us forward and establishing the foundation for the permanent memorial. Survivors have lived to tell their stories and we have a lot to learn from their strength and tenacity. These women have a lot to contribute to our community and we need to welcome their stories and expession.</p>
<p><strong>How will my pledge dollars be used?</strong></p>
<p>Phase One is a year long journey. Your pledges will be used to create a safe space where survivors can explore the themes of healing and memorializing, as well as a gallery space to bring the art to the public. These explorations will take place through drawing, painting, sculpture, dance, poetry, movement and other creative arts. Funds will also help build support among stakeholders (families of the victims, city officials, community groups, arts organizations, etc.) through community presentations and trainings for completion of the permanent memorial</p>
<p><strong>What will the permanent memorial look like? Where will it be?</strong></p>
<p>These questions will ultimately be answered in Phase Two of the GRVM Project. Phase One focuses on working with survivors to discover the themes, explore the issues, and facilitate the dialogue between survivors and the other stakeholders in the community that will essentially serve as the foundation for the permanent memorial.</p>
<p><strong>What is this the story behind the $10,000 perk level? A dry-eraser...really?</strong></p>
<p>In the late 1960s and 1970's, German artist and activist Joseph Beuys pushed the boundaries of what is considered an ""artwork"" with his ideas about expanding the concept of art. The issues of social and environmental justice figured prominently in his advocacy that ""everyone is an artist"" and that through ""social sculpture"", a better world is possible. Beuys created a series of what he called ""Chalk Talks"" where he gave presentations about social and environmental issues and later <em>sold the chalkboards that he used (or in some cases the erasers) as works of art. </em>Much of Beuys' work anticipated contemporary liberation arts methodologies and the art of social practice. In homage to Beuys, OPS will use just one dry-eraser for all workshops and presentations and present it to just one lucky person at the end of Phase One. </p>

<p class=""p2"">I have started this IndieGogo campaign because a) I am a broke-ish college student who has to pay for food and textbooks and b) there are SO many comic conventions I want to go to, and cosplays I want to make (the next kaylee one being her dress from Out of Gas and The Message, which is made out of kimono fabric, which is not easy to get your hands on). I've got the time and the dedication, but what I lack is funds. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>For several years now, <strong><a href=""http://www.post-mort.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Postmortem Studios</a> </strong>has been trying to help young or disadvantaged genre artists via the Zelart Scholarship.</p>
<p>Zel was a young artist we worked with on several projects, a man who should have had a great future in comics and illustration. For several years we paid him and helped him through his education until his life was tragically cut short in an accident.</p>
<p>In memory of Zel, and in recognition of how genre artists can have a hard time in education, and in making ends meet in life, we try to raise money to offer as a grant to a struggling artist.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Can Do</h3>
<p>We need your money to boost what we've made from previous winners being sold as stock art over the previous year. </p>
<p>We try to make $500 to offer each year, it's not a huge amount, but it's significant enough to make a difference. That $500 can help keep a roof over someone's head, keep them in ramen noodles, or help replace a lost or broken computer or tablet.</p>

</h3>
<p>My name is Stacey and I am a 26-year-old independent artist in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>Last year, I was diagnosed with several chronic illnesses that managed to ruin every good thing I had going . My poor health pulled me out of school though I was very close to graduating, away from the best job I'd ever had, out of contact with a lot of my friends, and perhaps worst of all: away from my ability to make   art. To say the least, times have not been pleasant.</p>
<p>My progress with recovery is promising, however gradual. Recently I have felt inspired enough to scrape myself out of bed and start drawing, inking or painting. This is a huge step considering how embarrassingly long I've now been out of commission, but I want to keep fighting and push myself further. The goal is to finish a series of four 11x15 ink drawings featuring my most elaborate work to date, and submit them to a gallery by the end of this year.</p>
<p> The theme of this series will be <strong>vitality</strong>. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, nowadays I'm in a precarious situation; bills are starting to pile up around me and my health is not yet stable enough for me to go back to work. Despite how I'm never short on willpower, I am becoming dangerously short on funds. This artistic goal I've set is exactly what I need to get me out of this rut between now and the time when I'll be able to work again.. But I'm going to need some help-- that's where you come in.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How much? What for?</h3>
<p>Basically, I need as much as I can get. I live pretty modestly in an inexpensive city, so some extra cash will go a long way for me! This money will be used for smaller expenses like art supplies as well as more significant expenses like rent. Regardless of whether I am able to make or exceed my goal funding amount of $600, all donations will be put toward necessities. </p>
<h3>What do you get?</h3>
<p>As it is my intent to express sincere gratitude to<em> anyone </em>who will help me through these difficult times, <em>all</em> donors will be rewarded and greatly appreciated. Everyone wins! Check the 'perks' list for more details.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why else?</h3>
<p>It's worth mentioning that I've been pretty shy with my artwork and have never before shown anything to such a potentially large audience! While this will be unfamiliar territory for me, I figure there's no better time than now to finally bounce back and feel unashamed to share this success with everybody. </p>
<p>Ultimately, I aim to become a more prolific, visible artist in this city. Perhaps there will be more gallery shows, perhaps someday I'll have my own exhibition.. Either way, it starts here. With your help, I'll be able to really throw myself into doing what makes me happiest, which means an awful lot for someone who has been able to do very little for such a long time. </p>

<p>We are participating for the first time in the annual Day of the Dead event in the Mission by building an altar that will be part of the little interactive illuminated village of altars in Garfield Park. When we decided to create an altar this year, we wanted to come up with a focus or specific theme for honoring the deceased. It seemed only appropriate to devote the altar to the many anonymous homeless people who perish on the streets of San Francisco and have few loved ones or often no one to memorialize them.</p>
<p>Our structure will be tiered with each tier propped up by 1 gallon cans of food, which will later be donated to a shelter. Each level will hold empty frames of various sizes to symbolize the nameless deceased who should be honored and paid the respects due to all in their passing. Candles and fresh marigolds, the traditional flower used to decorate Day of the Dead altars, will be interspersed between the frames.</p>
<p>We are in need of funding for building materials for the altar structure. As tier dividers we are utilizing large industrial size food cans which will be donated to a homeless shelter at the end of the event. All proceeds are going towards the project building or food can donations. Feel free to also bring food cans to the event and place them on the altar as an offering. </p>
<p>We hope to see you out on Nov. 2!  The altar will be set up near the clubhouse. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are K-Online Television, a Manchester- based entertainment company in pre-production for our first web series. We are all huge fans of Korean culture- the music, the dramas, the food. Our passion for this is shared by an increasing amount of people, who are all engaging with the Korean wave (Hallyu) as it grows across the UK. </p>
<p>Mind Your Language is bold, heartfelt and innovative, dealing with a range of issues such as arranged marriages, race, identity conflict and family. It will also blend the conventions of Korean Dramas, cleverly navigating between light moments and emotional scenes, exploring love and relationships between many of the characters. The range of races represented in the drama highlights the modern racial makeup of non-Korean fans in the U.K. However, despite their differences in culture and upbringing, their common connection is their passion and celebration of Korean culture. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have chosen to make this a flexible funding campaign. It is important for us to get going with the series, and if we don’t make our goal, we won’t try and stretch it too far, as we want it to be of the best quality. Instead, we will make 1  episode, and have that finished and ready. </p>
<p>We have our cast and crew ready, and have a very structured plan moving forwards. Once episode one is funded, we will begin shooting as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If we make above and beyond our goal (fingers crossed!), we will make more episodes, and maybe even get the whole series funded. </p>

We have chosen to make this a flexible funding campaign. It is important for us to get going with the series, and if we don’t make our goal, we won’t try and stretch it too far, as we want it to be of the best quality. Instead, we will make 1  episode, and have that finished and ready. 
We have our cast and crew ready, and have a very structured plan moving forwards. Once episode one is funded, we will begin shooting as soon as possible.
If we make above and beyond our goal (fingers crossed!), we will make more episodes, and maybe even get the whole series funded. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can’t afford to contribute to the project, we totally understand! We would really appreciate if you could “like” our pages on social media, and check out our YouTube channel. If you could go a step further and post/ tweet about the campaign, using the IndieGoGo share tools, we’d be forever grateful!

<p>My name is Bella Emmerich and someday, with your help, I will be a great artist.</p>
<p>I am 16 years old and I live in Napa California. My mom always says I was practically born with a crayon in my hand. Art is what I am meant to do. </p>
<p>Recently I was accepted to Oxbow School; Oxbow is an amazing one semester long art intensive program for high school juniors and seniors. Oxbow School is located in Napa California, and students from all over the United States (and sometimes even further) apply to the school; only the best young artists are accepted and I was lucky enough to be one of them.</p>
<p>If I receive enough funds to attend Oxbow I will live on campus, with about 43 other lucky students, for about four months and have an experience of a life time. Not only will I meet many other students just like me from all over the United States, go to many museums, and meet famous artists, I will also grow immensely as an artist and student from the training they will give me.</p>
<p>Oxbow School tuition is $23,000 per student; a big price to pay but worth every penny. This money will pay for my room and board on campus along with all school expenses and art supplies; fieldtrips, visiting artists, gallery entry fees, and many other things will be covered by the donation money I receive through indiegogo.com/getbellatoartschool.</p>
<p>Here is Oxbow Schools website if you are interested in learning more: <a href=""http://oxbowschool.org/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://oxbowschool.org/index.html</a></p>
<p>In addition to knowing you have helped me come one step closer to getting to the art school of my dreams, I am offering many great perks to anyone who donates to the cause! By helping out you could receive a mix CD, a thank you letter, or a one of a kind print or painting by Bella. Who knows maybe someday when my art is hanging in the MET (Metropolitan Museum of Art), the piece you have will be worth millions!</p>
<p>I have dreamed of attending Oxbow since I was in grade school, if you could help me achieve my dream I would be more than grateful. If you can donate, please do. However some people just can’t contribute, and that is perfectly okay; you can still help. Get the word out by telling your friends about my campaign!  </p>
<p>Go spread the word and get Bella to school!</p>

<p>Hello Everyone I am Karen!</p>
<p>Growing up I never had the typical dream of becoming a ballerina, doctor, or police officer. Instead I have always wanted to be an Artist! To share my artwork with the world and make people happy threw my talent has ALWAYS been a dream that has burned deep within my soul. I have always been blessed with great artistic ability, being able to draw, paint, sculpt, craft, and everything else in between. I refurbish, recreate, and restore furniture.  I have been in multiple Art shows, competitions, and juried exhibitions, I have been awarded Scholarships and have had my work purchased for collections. I have worked hard and meticulously on my artwork but my dream does not stop there!</p>
<p>I want to open up my own Art studio so that every artist in my community, young and old, has everything they need to achieve their own dreams. I want to light the fire within our children and adults that have given up their dreams because they don’t have a place to work, the materials they need, the support they deserve, and the platform to achieve their true potential.</p>
<p>However being a mother of two I find it difficult to sometimes follow my dreams. Putting my children fist I often do not have the extra money I need to achieve my goals.

<p>The effects of a poor economy does not just hit once then recover overnight, it lingers and rumbles like an earthquake for generations to come. Our children are at risk for not being able to experience the things we once did when we were children. Many Schools are faced with funding cuts and Art, sports, and Music are the first things to go.

<h3>What is Deathmension</h3>
<p>A veteran's 18 year attempt to live a normal life in a small town grows amiss when an invitation to a local screening opens the door to terrifying memories. What awaits him is a menacing figure from his past, the junction between a thriller and his twisted mind. Both a short and the core of The Deathmension Experience, it will be a double-edged sword of haunting visuals and sound design that will stun audiences.</p>
<h3>Deathmension Trailer</h3>

<h3>Meet The Veteran</h3>
<p>Known by many for his role in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and by few for his service in the Vietnam Conflict, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0623605/?ref_=nv_sr_3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ed Neal</a> is both a recognizable face in the horror genre and can easily incorporate his own experiences into the character he plays. Upon completion of the Deathmension short, Ed looks forward to the 4th wall tour cycle that is The Deathmension Experience.</p>

<h3>What Is The Deathmension Experience</h3>
<p>Using Virtual Reality (VR) and theatrical performance to amplify the narrative of the short film, The Deathmension Experience puts the audience in a haunted house-style LIVE attraction. While the purpose of VR is to put you in the same theater and mindset as the veteran, the real shock lies in the climax that The Deathmension Experience has to offer. Our process of combining these story telling mediums is referred to as ImmersoScope.<strong> <a href=""https://samsungvr.com/view/Wu11wou2hJp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can view our earliest ImmersoScope test by clicking here.</a></strong></p>
<p>The resources that we have accessible to The Deathmension Experience and the roadshow unit have since then grown in quality, and we plan to give all of you investors exclusive access to these developments</p>
<h3>What is The Deathmension Roadshow Unit </h3>
<p>The Deathmension Experience is an effort that involves transforming an entire theater. The roadshow unit is simply a mobile version of this concept which occupies a fraction of the space while maintaining the entirety of the experience. Through the combination of 180° projection and 3D sound, this one-seat build is a fantastic way to draw attention to The Deathmension Experience and all of the many people that it consists of. </p>
<h3>What The Deathmension Means To Us </h3>
<p>Since the conception of blending 3 story telling mediums to terrify audience members, this project has since evolved into a social good </p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness and development has been invested in more than 8 small-town theaters</li>
<li>Collaboration with the Wounded Warriors Project is underway for a Veteran's Day event</li>
<li>Revitalizing the economy of and inspiring local film productions in Taylor Texas</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Learned From Our Kickstarter</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Our original goal was $5.000. That amount would have comfortably secured The Deathmension Experience tour with 8 small town theaters. Due to Kickstarter's all or nothing structure, we have instead raised $1,705 and gained nothing. If we can raise this number on Indigogo, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct a screening of The Deathmension Exerience at the same theater we filmed it </li>
<li>Create the roadshow unit </li>
<li>Get out rewards to investors old and new</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What Deathmension Means to You</h3>
<p>The relevance of Virtual Reality and the combination story telling mediums is becoming all the more relevant with people such as Francis Ford Coppola pursuing similar projects to The Deathmension Experience at the expense of far more time and resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you invest in The Deathmension Experience, you invest in one of the very first projects to tap into this style of story-telling in a fittingly unconventional way</li>
<li>With the combined forces of professionals in the film-making, Virtual Reality, and live theater, a flavor is added that the majority of first time filmmakers simply don't have. </li>
<li>Above all else, you are creating a platform which boasts multiple types of creative expression, and groups that benefit social wellbeing </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Deathmension is a powerful short film on it's own. The Deathmension Experience is created to immerse you, the viewer, completely in the unhinged mind of The Veteran by allowing art to imitate life... to imitate art.</p>
<p>Our biggest risk is failing to provide you, our supporters, with that full experience.</p>
<p>Whether we are able to raise enough funding to provide one or more experiences, booking theater space, talent, and props required to share this unique movie-going experience with you is costly. Our ultimate goal is to bring The Deathmension Experience to festivals and conventions worldwide. While the roadshow unit will make that goal easier to pursue, we can't make that possible without you, the investors. </p>
<p>If our Indigogo campaign is unsuccessful, the pursuit of The Deathmension Experience, and it's accompanying roadshow unit may be affected. We are highly confident that this film will be complete before March 2017 and ready for a live theater exhibition during Mental Illness Awareness Week (MIAW). This will include all the rewards and awesome stuff we've got waiting for you.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the creative team behind this project has completed many great films and plan on completing many more in the future. We are dedicated to you and to getting this project finished with the highest quality possible. We want our names attached to nothing less than Spectacular!! We assure you, in lending your name to our final vision, you are committing to Greatness! Thank you so much again for your support!</p>

<p>The idea behind

possible! With that in mind, a group of friends decided to embark on an
exciting project of building a versatile center for aspiring, creative people. </p><p>As Greece has entered the fifth year of one of the worst economic recessions in

moving forward. Lots of great ideas have either been stalled at birth or
progressed at an extremely slow pace due to lack of support. </p><p><b>That’s what we
want to change.</b> What we offer is <b>an opportunity for everyone </b>to take that first
step towards realizing their dreams. We all remember our own first steps: how hard
it was to grasp all the non-romantic parts of being an entrepreneur; getting
our ideas, products, creations out there, bureaucratic obstacles, high costs,
lack of understanding and so on</p><p><b>The only thing we demand is be
passionate about what you do and smile. </b>Together we can make that first
exhibition, product testing, or meeting with a potential investor happen. There
are quite a few places in Athens that provide great equipment with well
decorated spaces for such purposes. </p><p>What is different about us is we offer the
whole new and unique experience for free, you won’t have to pay a thing to
share your inspirations with the world. </p><p>We will also work alongside you to
create an entire event around your ideas, hobbies, and passions Walls don’t

<p>Our
team is well experienced and all of us have worked for more than 10 years in our
respective fields. What makes us invincible though is our absolute determination and love
for what we do. We believe in team spirit, we believe in sacrifice for a common
goal. We have developed a sound strategy to implement along the entire range of
our services in order to be able to keep our word and never charge any fees for
providing our space for exhibits, presentations etc. We believe by utilizing our knowledge and great team work ethic
we will be able to achieve our goals.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b></b></p><h2><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Who will benefit</span></h2>
<p>While developing
the concept and discussing different ideas we have become absolutely infatuated with the number of great advantages we could offer the community. For the
general public it is a great place to come and have a relaxing time, whether
day or night, you can enjoy a meal prepared by our Italian chef, or a beverage
as well as our own signature cocktails while enjoying a live performance,
exhibition or just nice music.</p><p>For the neighborhood it creates a lot more
exposure and brings new crowds thus helping local businesses and
establishments. For the creative and aspiring individuals it is a chance to
show their work, share and discuss ideas, or take part in the development of
new creations with the <b>Vincent Vega</b> brand.So,
pretty much anyone with the right spirit can benefit. And by the right spirit
we mean just one thing be passionate! </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/668480/files/20140623054117-What-We-Do-2.jpg?1403527277"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p>
<h2>The place and
financial background</h2>
<p>The <b>Vincent Vega</b>
center will be located in one of the most diverse areas of downtown Athens,
Exarhia. A two level commercial space in a beautiful neo classical building is
to become the home of innovation and creativity. </p><p>The area has many educational
establishments making it one of the youngest
areas age wise. It also has museums, book stores, bars and restaurants. <br/>The
building is centrally located as it is on a main street, right next to a
hotel and the main square  Our architect
and interior designer came up with the idea of building the place in the spirit
of the Rock and Roll era and we all embraced it as we believe it captures the
spirit of the <b>Vincent Vega</b> project . </p>
<p>As we moved
forward we faced some substantial and unforeseen expenditure and subsequently
ran out of budget. While a bank loan is practically impossible at the current
market in Greece, and private investors demand high returns and collateral, we
decided that in reality the only way to do it right is through crowd funding. This way we can focus on our vision
for the project rather than high yields for our investors. We certainly plan to
be profitable, but not at the expense of what <b>Vincent Vega</b> stands for.</p>
<p>So, dear Indiegogo community, please help us make this wonderful idea a reality! Once
the budget is ensured we need three months to complete the construction and
we’ll be ready to “Rock n Roll.” You can follow our progress on our FB page as
well as Twitter, Instagram, and Youtube! </p>

Art Links is
a six-day exhibition that offers us all an opportunity to learn about art,
creativity and creative living.  Art Links includes work from over 50 different artists – painters, sculptors,
photographers, writers, musicians, dancers, fashion designers and comedians all
come together to share their creative lives with us all.


Art Links is an international art collective; a community united
through creativity. We showcase art that awakens the creative spirit in the
artist and the beholder; art which engages us as a connected society.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Art Links
features live concerts, talks and workshops from participating artists, invited
musicians, professors and performance artists. It is through these events that
we link our creative lives and our communities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Ediciones de la casa es un sello editorial fundado por una pareja de diseñadores que se ha propuesto resaltar la cultura y las tradiciones de Colombia, pais que tiene mucho que ofrecer culturalmente y que abre las puertas al mundo con la calidez de su gente. Como su nombre lo dice nuestras publicaciones nacen en casa con profundo interés en la calidad del resultado.  


Ediciones de la casa is a plublishing
house founded by a couple of designers with the goal of highlighting the colombian
culture and traditions. Colombia is a country that has a lot to offer in
culture and opens its doors to the world with the warmth of its people. As
stated in its name our work is done in home with huge interest in the quality
of the end product. 
                                                  El título CON ALMA VIDA Y SOMBRERO  proviene de una expresión popular que describe la pasión y las ganas con las que el colombiano hace sus cosas por simples que sean.  En este libro encontrará desde platos de cocina tradicional y objetos artesanales hasta vehículos de transporte, que nos representan y nos describen. Es un libro de pequeño formato, grande en sentimiento, totalmente ilustrado con una breve descripción en inglés y en español de cada objeto.                                                                                                               


The name CON ALMA VIDA Y SOMBRERO comes from a popular expression that describes the desire and passion that Colombians give when doing even the simplest things. In this book you will find from traditional food dishes, to hand crafted objects or transport vehicles that represent and describe us. It’s a book of small format, big with sentiment and totally illustrated with a brief description in English and Spanish of each object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           


Esta publicación rinde homenaje a 68 símbolos colombianos y sobre todo al trabajo del artesano que ha mantenido por años la tradición de nuestra gente.


This book pays tribute to 68 Colombian symbols and most important of all the work of the artisans that have maintained, for years, the tradition of our people.                                                                                                                                                                          
 
Gracias a su  ayuda lograremos hacer realidad la publicación de esta obra que se encuentra finalizada en un 85% en su etapa de diseño y pre impresión. Aun necesitamos 2 meses más de trabajo  y aunque hemos invertido nuestro tiempo en realizar este proyecto ahora entramos en la etapa de producción y acabados que incluyen el trabajo de muchas personas.   
Thanks to your help we will be able to finish this
book that its 85 % done, which is in its period of design and preprinting. We
still need two more months of work and even though we have put all of our time
in the making of this project we will now enter the stage of production and
finishing touches that include the work of a lot of people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes

Con el logro de la meta de financiación podremos imprimir  nuestro libro en pasta dura con su estuche en cartón imitando una caja de madera ( o guacal como le decimos en Colombia). Queremos editar el libro de la mejor forma sin que se vuelva costoso.
Si lo logramos, ""tendremos libro"". Todos nuestros colaboradores serán certificados como miembros de nuestra comunidad y obtendrán un descuento del 20% sobre futuras compras, cuando salga al mercado.
Si no llegamos a la meta en el tiempo establecido, ""Para atrás, ni para coger impulso"", solamente ajustaremos la cantidad de ejemplares a imprimir que sea posible, pero nunca se afectará la calidad del resultado final. 



What we need and what you get
Achieving
our goal will allow us to print our book in hard cover with a cardboard case
imitating a wooden box or guacal like
it’s called in Colombia. We want to produce and publish this book the best way
possible without making it expensive. 
All of
those who contribute will be certificated as loyal members of our community and
will get a 20% discount in future purchases, when it reaches the market. 
If we don’t
reach our goal in time, “we won’t go backwards”, we will only adjust the
quantity of books that we can print, but the quality of the end product won’t
be affected. 
   El impacto
Colombia ha sido un pais golpeado por problemas como el narcotráfico y conflictos internos... Ya no queremos más de esto! Tenemos un inmenso patrimonio cultural y sobre todo en nuestra gente sencilla y alegre, por algo dicen que, a pesar de todo, somos de los paises más felices del mundo.  Así queremos que sea nuestro libro, un homenaje  sencillo a lo auténtico de nuestra gente a través de sus símbolos.
Queremos que conozcan este libro no solo en nuestro país sino en todos los lugares donde despertemos el interés por conocernos de forma diferente. Ya hicimos una preedición de esta publicación para mirar su alcance a nivel local y su resultado nos motiva a seguir adelante actualizando la información como lo estaremos haciendo para esta edición con la ayuda de INDIEGOGO
Somos concientes de que este es un proyecto de interés local pero también sabemos que hay muchas personas y entidades en el mundo, interesadas en apoyar iniciativas como la nuestra, que aportan desde su lugar y desde su óptica para lograr un planeta mejor. 
The impact
Colombia has been a country struck by problems as the drug trafficking and internal conflicts... We do not want any more of this! We have an immense cultural heritage and especially in our simple and happy people, that is why is said that, regardless, we are one of the happiest countries of the world. We want our book to be this way, a simple honoring to the authenticity of our people across his symbols.  
We want this book to be known not only in our country but in all the
places where we might wake up the interest of other people to get to know us differently. We
did a preprinting of this publication to look at the reaction of the people at a local level, its result motivates us to continue updating forward the information of this edition
with  the help of INDIEGOGO.                                                                                                               
We are aware that this is a project of local
interest but we also know that there are many persons and entities in the
world, interested in supporting projects like ours, they contribute from their home and their point of view to achieve a better planet.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>QuailBellMagazine.com is a new(ish) but popular and thriving website based in Richmond, VA. With a core (volunteer) staff of primarily VCU students and recent grads, our online 'zine features work by contributors from across the globe. We showcase pieces that inform and entertain audiences in the realms of <strong>the imaginary</strong>, <strong>the nostalgic</strong>, and <strong>the otherworldly</strong>. In October 2011, we released our first print 'zine, Quail Bell Express 1. After our friend and Managing Editor died a few weeks later, we created a special edition of Issue 1 and re-released the 'zine in Spring 2012--distributing it for free across Richmond. <strong>Now we're looking to release Issue 2...with your help, please!</strong></p>
</div>
<div>Quail Bell believes in <strong>social innovation</strong>, <strong>community engagement</strong>, and bringing <strong>Richmond's creative scene</strong> to <strong>national attention</strong>. Our website has already gotten people across the world interested in RVA, with one reader in Portland, Oregon saying, ""I wish I could come hang out with you guys and the fairies of Richmond! You have such a creative spirit and always seem to have fun!"" We even have the support of notables like <strong>Doe Deere</strong>,<strong> Voltaire</strong>, and <strong>David Malki !</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Besides garnering the attention of people nation-wide, Issue 2 of our print 'zine, Quail Bell Express, would also help Richmonders better appreciate history and folklore in a new context. Because it would be available across Richmond for free, anyone in RVA can pick up a copy. (People in other parts of the world can order copies directly from QuailBellMagazine.com.) As the 'zine continues to grow, Quail Bell intends to use it as the centerpiece for Richmond-based fundraisers.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>At this point, we are asking to raise $<strong>1,000</strong> in order to 1) <strong>print copies of the 'zine</strong> at a volume discount, and 2) <strong>distribute them across Richmond</strong>. Nobody's making a profit here and <strong>all of us are volunteers</strong>! Anything we raise will go directly to these efforts. Your perks? See our list! They're all quirky, collectible, and truly representative of art and culture works curated by a Richmond staff. <strong>We really appreciate your help!</strong></p>

<h3>About Us:</h3>
<p>Changing Images Art Foundation is a 501(c)3 tax-exempt non-profit organization established in 1997 by Arlene RB Sullivan that provides ""medicine for the soul"" with its elaborate mural installation projects full of warm and vibrant colors that help brighten up institutional settings, allowing patients and caregivers to see pictures of hope and cheerfulness in what are commonly bleak surroundings, primarily nursing homes, hospitals, and treatment facilities.</p>
<p><span>Sullivan’s initial desire to form Changing Images came when her youngest child was hospitalized at two weeks of age and she spent two months in the intensive care unit with him.  A former art teacher, she was depressed that the only things that surrounded the patients in the unit were scary machinery, wires, tubing and beige, blank walls.  “After awhile, you start to adjust your breathing to the beeps.  The hospital itself and the medical staff were excellent but the atmosphere was not very cheerful or comforting,” says Sullivan. Her son is now happy and healthy. </span></p>
<p>Arlene creates her projects with the help of volunteers from all walks of life: patients and hospital residential staff, doctors, corporate volunteers as well as known celebrities who have autographed her artwork. Each project is a process of healing as people of all different age groups work together to create murals and often revisit the work when they return, knowing they were part of creating something of beauty in a communal art activity. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>For our supplies:</p>
<p>120 large canvases, each acting as a piece of a larger mural. </p>
<p>Black permanent markers for drawing and reworking the project in its final touches.</p>
<p>Non-toxic non-acrylic paints, both for the volunteers and patients to paint with as well as for subsequent touching up before the paintings are ready to be installed.</p>
<p>Varnish for touch-ups for when after painting is completed. </p>
</div>

<p> </p></div>","About Us:
Changing Images Art Foundation is a 501(c)3 tax-exempt non-profit organization established in 1997 by Arlene RB Sullivan that provides ""medicine for the soul"" with its elaborate mural installation projects full of warm and vibrant colors that help brighten up institutional settings, allowing patients and caregivers to see pictures of hope and cheerfulness in what are commonly bleak surroundings, primarily nursing homes, hospitals, and treatment facilities.
Sullivan’s initial desire to form Changing Images came when her youngest child was hospitalized at two weeks of age and she spent two months in the intensive care unit with him.  A former art teacher, she was depressed that the only things that surrounded the patients in the unit were scary machinery, wires, tubing and beige, blank walls.  “After awhile, you start to adjust your breathing to the beeps.  The hospital itself and the medical staff were excellent but the atmosphere was not very cheerful or comforting,” says Sullivan. Her son is now happy and healthy. 
Arlene creates her projects with the help of volunteers from all walks of life: patients and hospital residential staff, doctors, corporate volunteers as well as known celebrities who have autographed her artwork. Each project is a process of healing as people of all different age groups work together to create murals and often revisit the work when they return, knowing they were part of creating something of beauty in a communal art activity. 


What We Need:
For our supplies:
120 large canvases, each acting as a piece of a larger mural. 
Black permanent markers for drawing and reworking the project in its final touches.
Non-toxic non-acrylic paints, both for the volunteers and patients to paint with as well as for subsequent touching up before the paintings are ready to be installed.
Varnish for touch-ups for when after painting is completed. 

What You Get: 
While staying overnight at the hospital with her younger son, Arlene was inspired to write and illustrate a childrens' book: The Journey of Hanna Heart.
Hanna Heart is carried off by the wind to faraway lands: a jungle, a glacier, and under the sea, never knowing where the wind will take her. In each place, based on the beautiful murals Arlene RB Sullivan has drawn, Hanna Heart sees beauty and makes the most of her new surroundings.
Our greater contributors will receive a butterfly kit with canvas butterflies hand drawn and cut by Arlene RB Sullivan and a kit with art supplies so that they can paint their own and beautify their own space at work or home.
The Impact

<p>My name is Aaron Stromberg.</p>
<p>I am a local Albuquerque artist whom some of you
may know as the talkative dude at Stone Age Climbing Gym.</p>
<p>Recently, The Nob Hill Neighborhood
Association and Nob Hill Main Street, a grassroots community organization,
awarded me the opportunity to paint a mural in Nob Hill.  The mural is titled “Nob Hill is 100”, and will celebrate the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary
of this historic neighborhood.  The size is pretty impressive at 800
square feet and will transform the east-facing wall of Satellite Coffee in the
Fan Tang parking lot, close to the northwest corner of Central Ave. and
Carlisle Blvd.  </p>
<p>Needless to say, I am very honored
and excited about this project.  However,
before this mural becomes a reality, there is one last challenge that I need to
overcome; the budget for art supplies and equipment.  While Bernalillo
County has granted a small stipend for this project, it will only be sufficient
to cover the time I will spend working on the mural, not the supplies
necessary.  So this is where I need your help!</p>
<p>The goal of my campaign is to raise
$1,200, which is the estimated cost of paint and materials necessary to
complete this monumental public artwork. 
To substantiate how I arrived to this amount, I am providing below the
itemized list.</p>
<p>I greatly appreciate any donation and
I thank each and every one of you generous people from the bottom of my heart
for supporting me on this endeavor.  Creating a mural has always been a dream of mine, and with your help, this dream
will come true!</p>
<p>Please feel free to visit me while I’m working
on this project!  I will be working
4am to 11am, from September 14<sup>th</sup> until the end of October.  It will be a pleasure to talk to you
about the process through which this artwork came to be and the significance of

When we Black women, femmes, and TGNC folks decide to be artists, that is TO BE FREE, we are already taking a leap inside the impossible.    If we Black women, femmes, and TGNC folks not only make art, but make art that has to do with ourselves, that is, art that does not cater to the white gaze, art that is invested in Black and Indigenous ways of understanding the world, art that is grounded in grassroots and activist organizing, and ultimately, art that is in alignment with LIBERATION + SOVEREIGNTY, there is tremendous social and financial risk, stigma, and punishment. </p><p>Even in the best of times, we often end up working multiple jobs outside of our creative labor, simply to make life work, in addition to the countless days and nights in rehearsal rooms, studios, libraries, and educational settings to push our visions into the world. <strong>Much of this is invisible, uncompensated--and even costly--labor. </strong>We do not have easy access to inter-generational wealth, health insurance, or government bail-outs.  When tragedy hits, we are hit extra hard, as members of several communities at the intersections of many margins.  </p><p>Some of us stop being artists. Some of us continue, wounded and fatigued, but die before our time (Ntozake Shangé, Audre Lorde, June Jordan).  Some of us will not be remembered, having buried what we perceive as our “failed” dreams, and we will guard our descendants the way our elders tried to guard us from stepping out of line.  We become traumatized by  our “poor choices,” when the reality is that we live in a society that does not support artists, let alone Black women, femme, and other TGNC artists.</p><p>I am asking us to invest in another future. </p><p><br/><strong>THE STORY</strong></p><p>My great-grandmother, Willie “Jean” Moye, a Black-Native woman from Meridian, Mississippi, was a writer.

When we Black women, femmes, and TGNC folks decide to be artists, that is TO BE FREE, we are already taking a leap inside the impossible.    If we Black women, femmes, and TGNC folks not only make art, but make art that has to do with ourselves, that is, art that does not cater to the white gaze, art that is invested in Black and Indigenous ways of understanding the world, art that is grounded in grassroots and activist organizing, and ultimately, art that is in alignment with LIBERATION + SOVEREIGNTY, there is tremendous social and financial risk, stigma, and punishment. Even in the best of times, we often end up working multiple jobs outside of our creative labor, simply to make life work, in addition to the countless days and nights in rehearsal rooms, studios, libraries, and educational settings to push our visions into the world. Much of this is invisible, uncompensated--and even costly--labor. We do not have easy access to inter-generational wealth, health insurance, or government bail-outs.  When tragedy hits, we are hit extra hard, as members of several communities at the intersections of many margins.  Some of us stop being artists. Some of us continue, wounded and fatigued, but die before our time (Ntozake Shangé, Audre Lorde, June Jordan).  Some of us will not be remembered, having buried what we perceive as our “failed” dreams, and we will guard our descendants the way our elders tried to guard us from stepping out of line.  We become traumatized by  our “poor choices,” when the reality is that we live in a society that does not support artists, let alone Black women, femme, and other TGNC artists.I am asking us to invest in another future. THE STORYMy great-grandmother, Willie “Jean” Moye, a Black-Native woman from Meridian, Mississippi, was a writer. No one knew that this woman who grew up in the first half of the 20th century, who had once run into a burning building to rescue her daughter, was a writer until two decades into the 21st century when a manuscript was discovered in her basement, long after she’d departed this physical world.

I’m taking a step to change that and need your help to create a different story than the one my great-grandmother and so many of us still share.When Black Women, Femmes, and TGNC folks are invested in, we build a new world, in deeper alignment with all of creation.

<p>As a team, The Bucks transform the upstairs club at Franky Bradleys to create intimate one-of-a-kind experiences that our audiences can see, feel and, for this year's fringe, taste. This campaign would disallow restrictions and bring the Buck's vision to fruition.</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>We are Sophomores to Philadelphia Fringe Festival. Last years production ""JUNGLE"" was a show that many thought would be impossible to achieve in such an intimate space and many who attending were amazed by the transformation of the space. Although this is only our second Fringe Production, we regularly put on shows at this venue. Fringe is different however. The magnitude of this festival is huge for artists and audiences of the city alike. Therefore, the show needs to be bigger and better then the last. I mean, that is our mantra and we are sticking to it.""Raising the bar in Philadelphia"".</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are a few risks and challenges associated with this production. Most aren't worth mentioning because they are consistent with any production or idea that creators are building. However, there are some unique risks and challenges that come with this show. Here's some of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our budget for this show is much higher then any other show. It lands just shy of $10,000. I know this campaign is only just over half of that. However, we are taking into account our average ticket sales for the run of the show and we are confident that we can make up the difference and actually show a net to invest in future productions of the Bucks.</li>
<li>We have contracted multiple artists for the first time ever (5 Dancers and 2 Sound Engineers). This contract guarantees the artists a certain wage that we, as directors and producers, will be held accountable for. This is a nerve-racking first for us because normally we calculate artist wages based on ticket sales. Your not just backing The Bucks but your backing our team as well.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>To ask someone to open up their wallet and invest is asking a lot. For some it is asking the impossible and that is more then understandable. However, if your reading this you have the capability of sharing and making noise about this campaign. Whether you back us or not please share this to anyone and everyone and help the Bucks continue to raise the bar in Philadelphia. Oh yea! Buy a ticket and come see the show!</p>
