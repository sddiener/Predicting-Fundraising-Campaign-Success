more clearly into the moment whatever is relevant will arise.
How
Awesome this Will Be!
For a long time, I've sensed that
I've been given a message and I've felt compelled to share my music with as
many people as possible. It's a message of hope and peace. It's a message of
life and renewed strength and connection. It's a message of love in all and for
all. For me this message expresses itself in the lyrics and melodies of the
songs that have been gifted to me, as well as the vibrations of the ancient
flutes, I've been working with. If you can help to make my dreams and vision a
reality, I intend wholeheartedly, to pay it forward and help as many others as I
can.",28.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><i>Short Summary</i></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Renee Hayes is a singer, songwriter, certified counselor, career/life coach,
arts administrator and all around creative spirit.  After decades of singing with an acapella
group, The Irrationals, as well as background vocals on other people’s
releases, Renee is producing her first solo release, <i>Renewable Soul</i>, due out Spring 2014.  </p>
<p><i>Renewable Soul </i>is a collection of
heart and soul songs about the art and craft of living in the musical style
described as “eclectic acoustic soul”.  This ‘musical community garden’<span> is a creative
collaboration of fellow artists, friends and family who provided original
songs, and are working very hard to support the recording, production and promotion of this inspiring project.<span>  <i>Renewable Soul</i> is more than a passive
listening experience (although listening to the songs is great!).  The lyrics for each song include an activity and
question to consider that provides an opportunity for the listener to gain some
insight about life, creativity, and one’s place in this astounding and
sometimes absurd world.</span></span></p>
<p>Renee believes that <i>music can be a powerful source for growth and
renewal and that ‘life is just a chance to grow a soul’<span>.
</span></i>This campaign is to raise $7,500; a third of the expenses
needed to record, produce and distribute the release. Contributing to this project will help
Renee achieve the goal of nurturing and renewing others through the music of her
talented, diverse and wise creative community.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The total cost of this CD project is a little more than $20,000, of which we
are looking to raise $7,500 during this online campaign.  $3,500 will go towards a portion of recording
studio time and another $2,500 toward manufacturing of the CD and the
development of an interactive website, $1,000 will help with the costs for the liner
notes and inserts and the remaining $500 in online campaign fees.<br/></p>
<p>Here’s What You Get with your contribution. 
No amount is too small.  Your
contribution will make a profound difference and allow for the completion of
the project.  This CD is more than a
collection of songs—it’s a musical community garden.</p>

<p>Sappy
enough for you? Lol</p>
<p>So
you know about San Diego, right? <b>Wrong</b>. I grew up on the rough side (yeah,
there is one), in a split parent home where a lot of the time, as much as I
love my mom and dad, I was forced to grow up quickly and raise myself and my
brother. I didn’t have it all and still don’t, but I always found a way. It was
never easy. As smart as I am/was, I made some dumb decisions. I lived my life
as if there were no consequences and paid them, sometimes dearly. Through it
all, I always loved to make people feel good, and I happened to be able to do
so through my voice. </p>
<p>In
between trying to find my place in the world and trying to get myself out of
whatever crazy situation I had gotten myself into, I discovered a love for
music and entertaining. I loved to perform renditions of classics (my mom
introduced me to everyone from Billie Holiday to Dionne Warwick), and I love to
make people feel good, bad, sad etc, but above all, FEEL something. I knew I
wanted to do this on a larger scale, but was too young to realize that music
could be that. </p>
<p>With
the encouragement of people like my cousin Becky (who once made me perform in an
airport!), <span>Tell me how you felt…I decided
that I needed more, and I moved to LA. Like a lot of people, I quickly realized
that making it in Hollywood wasn’t going to be easy. Paint
the picture…400 square foot apt in MexicanvilleI knew where I wanted to
be, but wandered a long for a while trying to find out how to get there. At one
point, I got tired of waiting, and told myself I couldn’t anymore and began
writing a set of EP’s that I wanted to give to the world. These EP’s covered
everything from my saddest times, to my cat Stoli (kindve), to that one night
me and my friends (***CRAZY story*****) Perfect
soap opera technique – leave them wanting more!</span></p>
<p>So
here it is, I need to raise some money to give the best version of my story;
Not a lot, but some to cover recording, production costs, and some marketing. My
EP’s will play like a story, with an accompanying video for each song (So
basically, we’ll be doing it better than Beyonce). I have everything in line

<p>I
love where music is going and how artists are finally getting the freedom to
create for their fans off of what they truly feel inside. I want to be one of those
artists. I want to leave people with a feeling the way Etta James and Marvin
Gaye used to make my mom feel. AS much as I respect today’s artist, I think
there’s a void to fill, and I think I can do that with my stories, my passion,
and my commitment to make anyone who listens to my music know that they’re not

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Short Summary</span><br/>

You'll receive extra songs (see the list below), bonus features and better quality audio. If you use PayPal, you can have a download or CD very quickly. I'm thrilled with this album and want to make sure it gets heard. I've learned the hard way that if you don't promote an album well, very few people even learn that it is available. But it takes money to promote an album well. It costs thousands of dollars to do publicity or send songs to just one radio format, for instance. There's a great team excited about helping me make sure this album gets noticed but I've had to turn many of them down because I can't afford them. That's where you come in. You could look for the album in stores but you'll get fewer songs, none of the extras and you won't get the higher quality audio files that are included in the downloads here. Why should you get the album directly from me now? When you join this campaign you're not just buying music. You're investing in the impact that you believe we can have together and in the lasting value of the songs that will come from our musical journey together. Sharing goals and experiences like this means you're not just a ""fan"" of my music. You're a Sweet Friend Of Mine. Here's why this model works better and is essential to my getting to interact with you more and to my ability to continue to record.I’ve got some great rewards for individuals, groups and charities -- something for everyone. Each one has a different delivery date so you'll know when you should receive it. Check them out over there. -->You can also invite me to your town - for a Conversation or a concert. You’ll find the details–yep, you guessed it–right over there. -->Click a ""Claim This Perk"" button to see more information about ordering it, delivery dates, etc. If you pay by credit card, Indiegogo doesn't complete the transaction until several days after the campaign ends, so your delivery date is after that. If you use PayPal, the delivery date will be earlier than the one posted. I've already started working on a new live album (audio version and video version) to follow up Conversations. It will take several months to complete the live audio and video albums but they'll be great when they're done. Here's a video with all the details!Thanks again for your interest in my music.  Please share this page with your friends... choose the cool stuff you want... and check out some of the songs on my Conversations album.Christopher Redner created a Facebook group, which you can join, to help you learn how to increase your social media impact.

<p>I'm a musician, actor and singer. I love all three things with a deep passion, but if you asked me to choose the one that's nearest to my heart, <b>music </b>would win out in a heartbeat! My whole life has been musical. From chuch choir to the back seat of the car on family road trips (which naturally they <i>LOVED</i>,) my life has been a big loud symphony of song.</p>
<p>I was lucy enough to sign a record deal when I was 19, and cut my first record. It went nowhere. Since then I've self-released a bunch of albums and singles, toured the country with some of the most talented musicians around, and even had my songs featured in movies and tv shows!</p>
<p>The reality, though, is that it doesn't even begin to pay the rent, let alone rack up enough money to keep recording. That's where you come in!</p>
<p>This fundraising campaign is to raise money to produce my next record! How many times have you complained about how terrible popular music on the radio is? What have you done about it? The answer is simple: support indie artists whose music you love!</p>
<p>I'm keeping the fundraiser super simple. Here is the reward system:</p>
<h1>EVERYBODY GETS EVERYTHING</h1>
<div>Whether you choose to donate $1, $5, $20 or $1,000,000, everybody gets the same reward. This follows the idea of the ""pay what you can/will"" model. I want you to donate what YOU think is the ""right amount"". More on that below.</div>
<div>I hope you'll consider helping me continue to do what I love, and what I do best! Let's work together to keep the music playing. &lt;3</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The money raised in the campaign will go to the basics of recording an album. That includes rental of a studio, compensation for musicians who play on the album and who create the album artwork, and a small amount for the costs of digitally released it to iTunes (etc...)</p>
<p>What EVERYBODY gets for their contribution is pretty neat if I do say so myself. You'll get a link to a digital download of EVERY SONG I'VE EVER RECORDED. That's <b>SIXTY EIGHT</b> tracks! I'm also going to throw in a few surprises in your download.</p>
<p>You'll also get a custom made thank you video uploaded to YouTube for your enjoyication, and you'll be listed as a producer on the digital artwork featured on my website</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What happens if we don't reach the goal?</h3>
</div><div>If we don't reach enough money to produce a full album, I will use the funds raised to produce a smaller project; most likely a 4-5 track E.P. Should we dramatically surpass the goal...well, we'll cross that bridge when I'm thrown from it.</div><div>Thanks so much in advance for your generosity. I know with your help I can put out the record I'm dreaming of!</div></div>","Well hello, and welcome to my IndieGoGo! I'm James Bradford. Chances are if you made it here you already knew that.

This fundraising campaign is to raise money to produce my next record! How many times have you complained about how terrible popular music on the radio is? What have you done about it? The answer is simple: support indie artists whose music you love!
I'm keeping the fundraiser super simple. Here is the reward system:
EVERYBODY GETS EVERYTHING
Whether you choose to donate $1, $5, $20 or $1,000,000, everybody gets the same reward. This follows the idea of the ""pay what you can/will"" model. I want you to donate what YOU think is the ""right amount"". More on that below.
I hope you'll consider helping me continue to do what I love, and what I do best! Let's work together to keep the music playing. <3   What We Need & What You Get The money raised in the campaign will go to the basics of recording an album. That includes rental of a studio, compensation for musicians who play on the album and who create the album artwork, and a small amount for the costs of digitally released it to iTunes (etc...)
What EVERYBODY gets for their contribution is pretty neat if I do say so myself. You'll get a link to a digital download of EVERY SONG I'VE EVER RECORDED. That's SIXTY EIGHT tracks! I'm also going to throw in a few surprises in your download.
You'll also get a custom made thank you video uploaded to YouTube for your enjoyication, and you'll be listed as a producer on the digital artwork featured on my website

  What happens if we don't reach the goal?
If we don't reach enough money to produce a full album, I will use the funds raised to produce a smaller project; most likely a 4-5 track E.P. Should we dramatically surpass the goal...well, we'll cross that bridge when I'm thrown from it.Thanks so much in advance for your generosity. I know with your help I can put out the record I'm dreaming of!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>Giorgio Enrico Cavallo</b>, born in Turin, Italy in 1989, is a freelance journalist and writer, with a passion for poetry. He recently published ""L'ultimo foglia"", a collection of lyric poetry, mostly following the style of traditional poetry, respecting its meter and rhyme. He made the same choice for the libretto of the Passion and Ressurection according to St. John. Even so, the text is modern and touches on many critical aspects of our society. <br/></p>
<p>
<br/></p>
<h3><b>The Project</b></h3>
<p><i>On the occasion of the 
Presentation of the Shroud in 2015, the Confraternity of the Sacred 
Shroud of Turin has commissioned Alberto Mattea, a young musician 
specializing in Early Music, to compose a Baroque-style oratorio that 
retells the events of the Passion and Resurrection of Christ according 
to the Gospel of John.</i></p>
<p><i>The Passion, based on a libretto by 
the young writer, poet and journalist Giorgio Enrico Cavallo, follows 
the structure of a Baroque oratorio, with recitativi, solo arias and 
choral meditations.</i></p>
<p><i>Why use a Baroque model? The answer 
is...why not? Living in the 21st century doesn’t mean that the forms of 
the past have to be forgotten out of a pure love of progress and 
innovation. In a world in which art and beauty count for less and less, 
it’s still possible to renew art by looking into the past. Anacronistic 
sentimentalism? Not necessarily!  Renewing the Baroque doesn’t have to 
mean taking up a dead style again: The Baroque has left us a great 
musical inheritance of strong and expressive impact, whose resources are
 not yet exhausted. The Baroque style lends itself well to the 
magnificence and solemnity of a Passion, and that’s why the composition 
was commissioned in this style: The form lends itself well to the 
concept, and recalls the noble resonance of the great sacred 
compositions of the past. </i></p>
<p><i>In addition, the Baroque is also
 a period of great librettos, and in the case of our Passion According 
to St. John, the libretto was written in a style that closely follows 
the Baroque sensibility, thus recalling the old cooperation between 
composer and librettist. <br/></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<h3><i><i>Our Goal<br/></i></i></h3>
<p><i><i>The 
performance of The Passion, which is scheduled for April 2015, will last
 well over an hour and will require an ensemble of about 40 people, 
including a chorus, soloists, and an orchestra.</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>The 
orchestra will play on Baroque instruments--either originals or faithful
 copies--from the early 1700s. Such instruments aren’t available just 
anywhere, so it’s necessary to gather a qualified ensemble, including 
renowned professionals in the field of Early Music. Such an ensemble 
will allow us to reproduce the unique sound of the period. <i>This 
project implies a huge effort of orchestration and rehearsing, and the 
composition process itself is not to be underestimated!</i></i></i></p>
<p><i><i></i></i></p>
<h3><i><i><i>Prospects of the Composition<br/></i></i></i></h3>
<i><i>A
 first-quality performance will allow the composition to be seen and 
appreciated by a wide audience. If we receive more funds than necessary 
to put on the premiere of the oratorio, we will be able to put on 
additional concerts in select locations.</i></i><p></p>
<p><i><i></i></i></p>
<h3><i><i><i>Pass it on!</i></i></i></h3>Please
 tell as many people as you can about this project!  We need everyone’s 
help to reach even our minimal goals for the premiere of the Passion. 
Even if you can’t contribute anything yourself, you can tell your 
friends about it; you can tell the music and art-lovers you know about 
it; you can tell people of faith about it; you can tell anyone about it 
who might be interested in honoring the Presentation of the Shroud with 
 a musical premiere which represents the effort, faith, and strengh of 
many people working together for a good cause!<p></p>

La stessa scelta artistica è stata adottata per il libretto della Passione e Risurrezione secondo San Giovanni; nonostante ciò, si tratta di un testo moderno, che tocca anche molti temi critici della nostra società.

Il progetto
In occasione dell'Ostensione della Sindone 2015, la Confraternita del Santo Sudario di Torino ha commissionato ad Alberto Mattea, giovane musicista specializzato in musica antica, la composizione di un oratorio in stile Barocco che ripercorresse la Passione e Resurrezione di Cristo secondo il Vangelo di Giovanni.
L'opera, su libretto del giovane scrittore, poeta e giornalista Giorgio Enrico Cavallo, segue la struttura dell'oratorio barocco, con recitativi secchi, arie cantate dai solisti e meditazioni su corale. 
Perché la scelta dello modello Barocco? La risposta è... perché no? Vivere nel XXI secolo non significa che le forme del passato siano da dimenticare per il puro amore del progresso e dell'innovazione. In un mondo in cui l'arte e il bello contano sempre meno, è ancora possibile il recupero dell'arte guardando al passato. Sentimentalismo anacronistico? Non necessariamente!

L'obiettivo
L'esecuzione di tale composizione della durata di ben oltre un'ora, in calendario per aprile 2015, richiede un organico di circa 40 persone: tra essi ci saranno un coro, cantanti solisti e un'orchestra.
L'orchestra suonerà su strumenti barocchi, vale a dire originali o copie di strumenti musicali del primo '700. Tali strumenti non sono reperibili ovunque, ed é necessario riunire un qualificato ensemble di musicisti che li suonino. Alcuni di questi musicisti sono nomi di spicco nel settore della musica antica. Questo ci permette di offrire un'irripetibile esecuzione con le sonorità dell'epoca, e comporta un grande lavoro di orchestrazione e prove. Inoltre non è da sottovalutare l'imponenza del lavoro compositivo!
Gli sbocchi della composizione
Una prima esecuzione di qualità permetterà alla composizione di essere conosciuta ed apprezzata da un ampio pubblico. Se sorpasseremo la cifra necessaria per eseguire l'Oratorio, saremo in grado di organizzare delle repliche in luoghi di rilievo.
Passaparola!
È importante far conoscere il progetto a quante più persone possibili! Per raggiungere, e magari superare, il traguardo minimo indispensabile per la prima esecuzione assoluta, c'è bisogno dell'aiuto di tutti! Se anche non avete modo di contribuire direttamente, fate conoscere il progetto ai vostri amici, agli amanti della musica e dell'arte, a chi Crede che si possa onorare un evento quale l'Ostensione Sindonica con una grande creazione artistica che rappresenti l'impegno, la Fede e le lo sforzo di molte persone con un unico, grande intento!

 recordings for the liturgical music magazine Armonia di Voci edited by 
Alessandro Ruo Rui. In addition, he participates in historical 
reenactments, period fencing, filmmaking and oil painting.
Giorgio Enrico Cavallo, born in Turin, Italy in 1989, is a freelance journalist and writer, with a passion for poetry. He recently published ""L'ultimo foglia"", a collection of lyric poetry, mostly following the style of traditional poetry, respecting its meter and rhyme. He made the same choice for the libretto of the Passion and Ressurection according to St. John. Even so, the text is modern and touches on many critical aspects of our society. 


The Project
On the occasion of the 
Presentation of the Shroud in 2015, the Confraternity of the Sacred 
Shroud of Turin has commissioned Alberto Mattea, a young musician 
specializing in Early Music, to compose a Baroque-style oratorio that 
retells the events of the Passion and Resurrection of Christ according 
to the Gospel of John.
The Passion, based on a libretto by 
the young writer, poet and journalist Giorgio Enrico Cavallo, follows 
the structure of a Baroque oratorio, with recitativi, solo arias and 
choral meditations.
Why use a Baroque model? The answer 
is...why not? Living in the 21st century doesn’t mean that the forms of 
the past have to be forgotten out of a pure love of progress and 
innovation. In a world in which art and beauty count for less and less, 
it’s still possible to renew art by looking into the past. Anacronistic 
sentimentalism? Not necessarily!  Renewing the Baroque doesn’t have to 
mean taking up a dead style again: The Baroque has left us a great 
musical inheritance of strong and expressive impact, whose resources are
 not yet exhausted. The Baroque style lends itself well to the 
magnificence and solemnity of a Passion, and that’s why the composition 
was commissioned in this style: The form lends itself well to the 
concept, and recalls the noble resonance of the great sacred 
compositions of the past. 
In addition, the Baroque is also
 a period of great librettos, and in the case of our Passion According 
to St. John, the libretto was written in a style that closely follows 
the Baroque sensibility, thus recalling the old cooperation between 
composer and librettist. 

Our Goal
The 
performance of The Passion, which is scheduled for April 2015, will last
 well over an hour and will require an ensemble of about 40 people, 
including a chorus, soloists, and an orchestra.
The 
orchestra will play on Baroque instruments--either originals or faithful
 copies--from the early 1700s. Such instruments aren’t available just 
anywhere, so it’s necessary to gather a qualified ensemble, including 
renowned professionals in the field of Early Music. Such an ensemble 
will allow us to reproduce the unique sound of the period. This 
project implies a huge effort of orchestration and rehearsing, and the 
composition process itself is not to be underestimated!

Prospects of the Composition
A
 first-quality performance will allow the composition to be seen and 
appreciated by a wide audience. If we receive more funds than necessary 
to put on the premiere of the oratorio, we will be able to put on 
additional concerts in select locations.

Pass it on!Please
 tell as many people as you can about this project!  We need everyone’s 
help to reach even our minimal goals for the premiere of the Passion. 
Even if you can’t contribute anything yourself, you can tell your 
friends about it; you can tell the music and art-lovers you know about 
it; you can tell people of faith about it; you can tell anyone about it 
who might be interested in honoring the Presentation of the Shroud with 
 a musical premiere which represents the effort, faith, and strengh of 
many people working together for a good cause!

La campagne n’est pas terminée pour autant et vous pouvez toujours précommander l’album ou choisir l’une des nombreuses contreparties proposées (jusqu'au 6 juillet !). Plus votre soutien est important, plus vous nous aider à avancer sereinement dans la production de ce disque :(english version below)
""A Life Worth Memoirs"" :""A life worth memoirs"" est le nom de notre prochain album, sur lequel nous travaillons depuis maintenant presque deux ans. La composition est finie, les pré-productions sont faites et nous avons déjà hâte de vous faire écouter ça !Nous avons travaillé très dur et sommes déjà fiers du résultat : à la fois plus violent et plus ambiancé que ce que nous avons fait auparavant, plus consistant également (près d'une heure d'album).Le groupe entrera au studio Sainte-Marthe à la mi-juillet pour mettre les 12 titres en boite. L'album sortira à l'automne 2014.Pour vous donner envie d'en savoir plus sur cet album, vous recevrez dès votre contribution la version pré-prod de ""Meat Locker"" par e-mail.Un aperçu du nouvel album avec cette vidéo live de ""Just Make Me A F***ing Sandwich"" :A quoi servira la collecte ?Comme nous l'avons fait depuis nos débuts pour l'ensemble de nos productions, il nous parait évident d'assurer nous-même la majeure partie du financement de ce nouvel album.Mais votre aide nous sera plus que précieuse, et servira a financer une partie des frais de production du nouvel album, à savoir :
L'enregistrement, le mixage et le mastering // 6000€
Le pressage des cd (digisleeve 3 faces avec livret)  // 1500€
La promotion, les frais d'envois, frais divers... // 1000€
NB = Nous avons opté pour un financement flexible. Le projet sera donc validé, même si la collecte n'est pas complète.Le groupeHolding Sand a été créé en 2007 à Tours.Depuis le groupe a acquis une solide expérience de la scène ( auprès de Mass Hysteria, Fishbone, AqME, Bukowski, entre autres...) et compte a son actif 1 album et 2 EP :
Some things are better left unsaid (2012)
On Sleepless Nights (EP 5 titres - 2010)
Ebb & Flow (EP 3 titres - 2009)

<h3>The Music</h3> <p>""Some Big Mystery"" includes 11 songs from the past 8 years as I migrated from Carbondale to Chicago, and finally landing right in the middle of Illinois at the state capitol, Springfield. The recordings were made in rental homes, bedrooms, and basements using everything from cassettes to computers. At the time, I didn't have a specific direction and would follow my muse, finishing the songs I liked and scrapping the ones I didn't. This record is the result of that long-tailed process of self-correction, grabbing the good stuff from the past and adding new songs that I'm even more proud of.

""He creates music that is both imaginative and engaging to listener and performer. He is also a very fine saxophonist and improviser."" -Jeff Campbell, Director of Jazz Studies and Contemporary Media at Eastman School of Music
You can hear some of Levi's other work on his SoundCloud.

<h2><strong>Pourquoi appuyer le PAQG cette année ?</strong></h2>
<p>Le PAQG a grandement besoin d’un coup de pouce de ses membres et sympathisant-e-s afin d’assurer une continuité dans la qualité de ses activités d’éducation.</p>
<p>Cette année, nous nous sommes donnés comme mission de faire connaître une des stratégies actuelles les plus utilisées afin de faire taire les défenseur-e-s des droits humains et du territoire au Guatemala : la criminalisation. Celle-ci peut prendre plusieurs formes : l’utilisation indue et abusive des lois criminelles et anti-terroristes, la détention illégale et arbitraire des activistes, les déclarations d’autorités gouvernementales accusant sans fondement les activistes d’actes criminelles, entre autres. Le projet du PAQG s’articulera en trois volets :</p>
<ol>
<li> La rédaction et la diffusion médiatique d’une déclaration s’opposant à la criminalisation et demandant l’action des gouvernements guatémaltèque et canadien;</li>
<li>La réalisation d’une tournée à travers le Québec avec deux défenseur-e-s des droits humains guatémaltèques ayant vécu les répercussions négatives de la criminalisation;</li>
<li>La rédaction d’un rapport sur la criminalisation remis devant le Sous-Comité pour les droits internationaux de la personne du Parlement du Canada et diffusé dans les médias.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Comment votre argent sera investi?</h2>
</div><p>L’argent recueilli nous permettra entre autres de renforcer notre budget permettant de payer les dépenses liées à l’accueil des invité-e-s guatémaltèques, soient leurs billets d’avion, leur hébergement, leur transport et leur nourriture. Nous avons déjà réussi à avoir un important appui financier du ministère des Relations internationales et de la Francophonie (MRIF) par l'entremise du Fonds d'éducation et d'engagement du public en solidarité internationale (FEEPSI), mais nous aurons besoin d'argent supplémentaire pour garantir la pleine réalisation de toutes les activités prévues.</p><h2><strong>Qui sommes-nous?</strong></h2><p>Depuis 1992, le Projet Accompagnement Québec-Guatemala (PAQG) pose des gestes solidaires avec les populations du Guatemala qui défendent leurs droits civils, politiques, économiques, sociaux et culturels.

</i></h2><p></p><p><i>Vessel</i> is my third studio album; its songs are an exploration of water and our connection to it. After living close to the mountain and the water for three years, the natural sounds from this region have really impacted the way I write, sing and record music.</p><p>Vessel is a song-story about the Heroine's Journey. My personal story and a universal story.<br/></p><p>""All of the great mythologies and much of the mythic story-telling of the world
are from the male point of view. When I was writing <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i> and wanted to bring female
heroes in, I had to go to the fairy
tales. These were told by women
to children, and you get a different perspective. It was the men who
got involved in spinning most of the great myths. The women were too busy; they had too damn much
to do to sit around thinking about stories"" – Joseph Campbell

</blockquote><p></p><h1>          ∆≈MY STORY≈∆</h1><p>In 2009 I successfully raised $50,000 to fund my second album ""Tame the Night"" through the platform Sellaband. Back then crowdfunding wasn't heard of, and my friends and family thought I was crazy to embark into this unknown. Needless to say, it was an interesting journey with its ups and downs, but thanks to 903 contributors or ""believers"" I was able to reach my goal ($50K was the predesigned goal for Sellaband users) and get to work with a Grammy winning producer in NY.<br/></p><p>This is my first self-produced record; definitely a labor of love. Seeing the songs from their conception to their completion is an unexplainable process of love and devotion for the music that comes through me. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed working on it so far. I've put all my resources to be able to spend studio time, pay a symbolic amount to musicians, creating this video, some photos, partial mixing, etc. Now I need your help to finish proper production and have a finished product that I can send into the world.<br/></p><p>I've myself funded these so far:<br/></p><p>*Partial payment to musicians</p><p>*Partial Studio Time and Engineering Costs</p><p>*Travel expenses &amp; food.<br/></p><p>*Equipment rental and purchase</p><p>*Production costs</p><p>*Countless hours of writing, demos, recording, comping, etc.<br/></p><p><br/></p><h1 style=""text-align: center;""><b>≈WHERE THE FUNDS WILL GO:≈</b></h1><p>The making of an album is a labor of love. Albums are less and less common in favor of the single, but Albums still matter. Soundscapes and storylines that entice the listener to experience the world from 'inside the music' are, like water, something we usually take for granted, until it's gone.<br/></p><p>In order to finish the production  of Vessel, we still need help with these costs:<br/></p><p>*Studio Sessions (additional Instrumentation)<br/></p><p>*Musicians (who've already played on the album)<br/></p><p>*Engineering</p><p>*Vocal Production<br/></p><p>*Mixing</p><p>*Mastering</p><p>*Album Art Design<br/></p><p>*Album Duplication/ Shipping<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Any funds above $20,000 from the campaign will go towards:</p><p>*Touring! To support the album Live<br/></p><p>*Music Video</p><p>*Photographs<br/></p><p>*Marketing &amp; Promotion</p>To Thank You for your contribution and belief in the fruition of this album I have created some perks.

However, you can still be part of the making of #Vessel and contribute, the campaign is not over yet. Every penny above the goal will go towards touring and promotions to support the album.I am feeling DEEP gratitude to each of you literally put your money where your mouth is and delivered the best Xmas present in the Spring I could ever get. I promise to you that I will continue pouring all my love and resources into the completing of this beloved album.Also......Everyone who contributes before the end of the campaign (today!) will be invited to a Secret Beach Party in the Bay Area. Great music and cool people...Let's celebrate this success together! YEAH!!!≈∆≈Pledge to Pre-Order my new album Vessel
Vessel is my third studio album; its songs are an exploration of water and our connection to it. After living close to the mountain and the water for three years, the natural sounds from this region have really impacted the way I write, sing and record music.Vessel is a song-story about the Heroine's Journey. My personal story and a universal story.""All of the great mythologies and much of the mythic story-telling of the world
are from the male point of view. When I was writing The Hero with a Thousand Faces and wanted to bring female
heroes in, I had to go to the fairy
tales. These were told by women
to children, and you get a different perspective. It was the men who
got involved in spinning most of the great myths. The women were too busy; they had too damn much
to do to sit around thinking about stories"" – Joseph Campbell
I hope the music in Vessel will submerge you in magic, reflection and beauty, and that these songs will inspire you to cross over to uncharted worlds.www.lilikoimusic.comwww.lucia.bandcamp.com

          ∆≈MY STORY≈∆In 2009 I successfully raised $50,000 to fund my second album ""Tame the Night"" through the platform Sellaband. Back then crowdfunding wasn't heard of, and my friends and family thought I was crazy to embark into this unknown. Needless to say, it was an interesting journey with its ups and downs, but thanks to 903 contributors or ""believers"" I was able to reach my goal ($50K was the predesigned goal for Sellaband users) and get to work with a Grammy winning producer in NY.This is my first self-produced record; definitely a labor of love. Seeing the songs from their conception to their completion is an unexplainable process of love and devotion for the music that comes through me. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed working on it so far. I've put all my resources to be able to spend studio time, pay a symbolic amount to musicians, creating this video, some photos, partial mixing, etc. Now I need your help to finish proper production and have a finished product that I can send into the world.I've myself funded these so far:*Partial payment to musicians*Partial Studio Time and Engineering Costs*Travel expenses & food.*Equipment rental and purchase*Production costs*Countless hours of writing, demos, recording, comping, etc.≈WHERE THE FUNDS WILL GO:≈The making of an album is a labor of love. Albums are less and less common in favor of the single, but Albums still matter. Soundscapes and storylines that entice the listener to experience the world from 'inside the music' are, like water, something we usually take for granted, until it's gone.In order to finish the production  of Vessel, we still need help with these costs:*Studio Sessions (additional Instrumentation)*Musicians (who've already played on the album)*Engineering*Vocal Production*Mixing*Mastering*Album Art Design*Album Duplication/ ShippingAny funds above $20,000 from the campaign will go towards:*Touring! To support the album Live*Music Video*Photographs*Marketing & PromotionTo Thank You for your contribution and belief in the fruition of this album I have created some perks.

Since October 2011 <strong>Darrow Chemical Company</strong> has released 3 studio EP’s and 1 live EP on our own label, <strong>W.H.B.

We successfully met 120% of our goal, reaching $12,000. With that money we set out and accomplished just about everything we had planned and then some.  <br/><br/>This year, we plan a new campaign with different goals in mind. We recently announced our 3rd US tour, a <a href=""http://darrowchemicalcompany.com/shows/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">6 week tour</a> that will span from coast to coast this summer. This time around, our goals involve repairing and maintaining our van so that it survives a 6 week run, ensuring our safety and successful completion of the tour.

But for those that aren’t, Darrow Chemical Company comes from the ashes of several namesake underground bands. Past member projects include Mister Monster, Gotham Road, Michale Graves Band (Ex Misfits), Blitzkid and The Doomsday Prophecy. This band was started in late 2009 and we have prided ourselves on being a hard working DIY band from that moment. Since October 2011 Darrow Chemical Company has released 3 studio EP’s and 1 live EP on our own label, W.H.B. Records. A split 7” on No Balls Records (Germany) and a Second Pressing of our 1st Studio EP in cassette format (W.H.B. Records). We've also embarked on 2 self booked, financed and promoted national tours, not to mention a pretty impressive line of DIY merchandise. Natural Born Grillers Tour & More!A little over a year ago, we launched our first Indiegogo campaign. We successfully met 120% of our goal, reaching $12,000. With that money we set out and accomplished just about everything we had planned and then some.  This year, we plan a new campaign with different goals in mind. We recently announced our 3rd US tour, a 6 week tour that will span from coast to coast this summer. This time around, our goals involve repairing and maintaining our van so that it survives a 6 week run, ensuring our safety and successful completion of the tour. We aim to re-stock our merchandise for the tour, as well as provide new content.This is where you, the fans, and Indiegogo come into play!Once again, we are leaning on our fans for support. We have so many ideas that we want to bring to reality, but we need your help to make that happen. We have tried to come up with fun and valuable perks at many levels as an incentive to invest in our campaign without being too cheesy about it.What We Need & What You GetWe’ve set our campaign goal at $5,000. The following is an outline of the items our budget will cover:Items include but are not limited to:
4 new tires plus alignment for our van 
other mechanical repairs and maintenance for our van
New/additional merchandise and restocking of the old merchandise
Production, mastering and pressing of a B-sides release entitled ""Demos, Outtakes and Obscurities""
Mastering and pressing of The Doomsday Phrophecy (Loki and JV's previous band) demos through W.H.B. Records
Repressing of older releases
Promotional materials for upcoming tour (Tour posters, post cards, stickers, etc...)
Video & Audio equipment to begin filming a future DVD. We also plan to start our very own Bootleg Series which we will make available on DVD and digital download. 
Tour road crew
Cases for our gear
Costs for producing and shipping perks
There are a couple of items here that can't be stressed enough. Our Indiegogo costs alone will be close to, if not over $1000. The health of our van is of the utmost importance as it pertains to our safety and to the success of the tour. Our $5000 goal is very modest. In reality we will have to exceed our goal by a healthy margin. Our perks and incentives for pledging include:
Digital raffle ticket for a grand prize
Pins
""Natural Born Grillers Tour"" koozie 
Hand written lyrics
Exclusive T-shirt with art by Argyle Goolsby
""Natural Born Girllers Tour"" BBQ Apron

You’ll see a much more detailed rundown of our perks in the right column! We will be adding and removing perks as we go along so if you see something you're interested in, act quick! You never know how long that perk will be available. We worked hard on trying to create incentives that gave you excellent value on your investment and are fun. We hope that you like what we have to offer!The ImpactLast year was a huge success. We look to build off that foundation. We want to expand our reach, we look to introduce new types of content through our website, YouTube and on DVD.

We can only hope to entertain and inspire you to the best of our abilities.Every contribution counts!No contribution is too small. Every pledge makes a world of difference.

Let's celebrate the LOVE in this Universe through the songs we sing together. I have challenged and dedicated myself to completing and masterfully recording my debut EP, DreamCatcher.  You amazing people are my best friends and closest families. You've been there for me in your own unique, yet crucial ways along this journey of my Spirit, my growth, and my musical creation.  In the same way I strive to make myself and my energy avaiable to positively affect each of you, I now use my Hawk's cry to humbly call for your loving donations.  In return, I am proud to offer some fantastic rewards that will leave you feeling ecstatic about your contribution to something bigger than all of us.  </p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font: inherit; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; border-style: initial; border-color: initial;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/314565/files/20140117133659-IMG_0916.jpg?1389994619"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(18, 26, 13);"">The songs I write and sing ALL come from the Spirit in my Soul, which I use to hold up the mirror into YOUR own journey of the Spirit.  Songs of overcoming fear, being unlovable, and finding your compass and your hearts song.

<p></p></span><p></p></div>","It's TIME to start celebrating what we hold closest to our hearts - family, community, abundance, and Spirit! Let's celebrate the LOVE in this Universe through the songs we sing together. I have challenged and dedicated myself to completing and masterfully recording my debut EP, DreamCatcher.  You amazing people are my best friends and closest families. You've been there for me in your own unique, yet crucial ways along this journey of my Spirit, my growth, and my musical creation.  In the same way I strive to make myself and my energy avaiable to positively affect each of you, I now use my Hawk's cry to humbly call for your loving donations.  In return, I am proud to offer some fantastic rewards that will leave you feeling ecstatic about your contribution to something bigger than all of us.  The songs I write and sing ALL come from the Spirit in my Soul, which I use to hold up the mirror into YOUR own journey of the Spirit.  Songs of overcoming fear, being unlovable, and finding your compass and your hearts song. Songs of freedom, passion, and new beginnings.  Songs of silly nonsense, and of meandering Spirit sounds.  My dreams have been clawing their way through my waking reality in the form of musical medicine, and I'm proud to offer you a dose of my heart.
Your pennies, nickels, dimes, and dollars will be used to pay for studio production, engineering, mastering, rehearsal space, CD duplication and design, promotional photos, online distribution, legal blah blah, Dreamcatcher making supplies, and stickers of course. Maybe lovingly made Dreamcatcher soaps and bath fizzies?! It's gettin' real.


WHY Am I asking for your pledges to DreamCatcher:Cost Breakdown*The cost of recording music inependantly has come WAY down over the years thanks to technology and improved quality of computers/mics/interfaces.  That being said, what would have cost well over $10,000 in the past can be done for way under $5000 now!  My $3333 number is an odd one, but considering indieGoGo takes between 4-9% of the final proceeds, (dependand on hitting the goal) $3000 is exactly what I'll need to officially record, mix, master, produce, and duplicate the DreamCatcher EP, complete with original cover art, CD design, eco friendly cases, etc. YOUR willingness to buy a great CD with fun rewards, and help a man you love make his dreams come true is what this project is all about!  Music for your life, your heart, your yoga, your soul, your movement - both physically and spiritually, your willingness to step into your greatness and bring people with you - that's what I'm about, and that's what my music is all about.Here's where the money comes into play:>Producing physical copies of the record - $1000>Equipment - Digital Interface for Recording(Saves me from Studio Costs!) - $150>Equipment - Actual Working Non-broken Guitar - $900>Equipment - Recording Headphones/Cables/Wiring - $100>Digital distribution (releasing on Spotify, iTunes, etc) - $200>Cover art/photography - $200>Copyrights for each song - $200>DreamCatcher Making Supplies - $100>Sticker Printing - $100>Album Release Bonfire Party supplies! - $100>IndieGoGo's Percentage for Hosting - approx. $300 (TBD upon completion)TOTAL - $3350There will undoubdtedly be unexpected costs that arise during this fantastic journey, so anything that exceeds the goal will be put right back into the album to increase its greatness in the way of more songs, better audio quality, super ultra top-secret rewards... Exciting! I am extremely proud and excited to share my music with each and every one of you.  I sincerely believe that we can awaken and enliven the spirits and souls of those around us with our messages of LOVE.

I stand as a living example of what it means to discover your passion and live from trust.  I surround myself with incredible people like you, and now it's time to spread the Love to those who need it the most.  Please help me make this album, so I can return the favor in countless ways on countless days!  I'll be UPDATING this project page often, so check back for uploads and videos of rough cuts and live gigs featuring songs from the album.

<p>Founded in 1999 by world music composer, Lynne Holmes, Desert Rose is based in Cape Town and are widely regarded as leading composers, producers and performers of Universal World Music. </p>
<p>Yusuf Ganief and Lynne Holmes are at the heart of Desert Rose, a dynamic and quirky couple determined to challenge convention as they explore the creation and emergence of a new musical genre. Desert Rose includes leading South African musicians and vocalists and is committed to creating new works annually which merge a kaleidoscope of culture with the innovative use of ancient languages and ultimately transform into a language beyond words. </p>
<p>The ‘Soul Journey’ debut at Wits Theatre in Gauteng on the14th of November 2014 marks the beginning of Desert Rose’s shift toward an internationally recognized partnership with Waken Undaground which will serve to enrich the industry and allow further development of their collective and proudly South African brands both locally and internationally. </p>
<p>As the debut performance draws near, Desert Rose, in collaboration with Waken Undaground, are simultaneously preparing for a world tour to Scotland, France and Ireland, scheduled for April/May 2015. </p>
<p>The primary focus for the tour, running throughout April/May 2015, is to create an entry point and set the stage for the launch of our joint venture, ‘The OZ Project’. This initiative will engage on many levels as a global multi-cultural music, visual and performing arts exchange program which aims to dissolve artistic borders between South Africa, Ireland and France and launches officially 1st July 2015 in Dublin. </p>
<p>Desert Rose’s return to the world stage will facilitate the momentum for the long term partnership goal to produce and disseminate music, promoting culture and encouraging processes for change. </p>
<p>The Waken Undaground dream is as simple as it is ambitious, a global social organism operating within an artistic framework, representative of the diversity of the human family wherein each individual plays a crucial role in creating symmetry on every level. </p>
<p>We aim to inspire a new world with our enterprise using collaboration as a tool for transformation, liquidating boundaries via music, art and dance and staying true to our relentless pursuit of global unity. One world, one nation , one heartbeat, one mind. </p>
<p>We value your support and would love to hear from you should you wish to become involved in our projects or perhaps you would simply like to meet and greet to explore the art of opportunity whilst sharing ideas. </p>

<p>Life as musicians is a beautiful struggle. We must keep the journey going not because of the guarantee but because of the possibility. As with any venture, our starting point is an absolute, unswerving devotion to our cause and a healthy dose of reality. </p>
<p>In todays climate collaboration is key and in order to ensure our success we are partnering with Waken Undaground and many local and international artists in keeping with the philosophy that collectively we achieve so much more than we can individually. <br/></p>

Compensating our artists and our team - Creating new performances from scratch is a costly endeavour, especially with our local musicians dependent on these performances as their livelihood. 
Raising the necessary production and replication costs for our CD, transforming it into a creatively packaged listening experience. Your contributions will offset our debts and help us as we push forward. 
Having additional funds at our disposal for publicity and marketing will supply the key ingredient for a full house and the freedom to focus on ensuring that the ’Soul Journey’ experience will be an unforgettable one and will allow us to ensure an inspired musical adventure into an evocative landscape of rhythm and sound on the evening of our performance. 
The Impact 
Founded in 1999 by world music composer, Lynne Holmes, Desert Rose is based in Cape Town and are widely regarded as leading composers, producers and performers of Universal World Music. 
Yusuf Ganief and Lynne Holmes are at the heart of Desert Rose, a dynamic and quirky couple determined to challenge convention as they explore the creation and emergence of a new musical genre. Desert Rose includes leading South African musicians and vocalists and is committed to creating new works annually which merge a kaleidoscope of culture with the innovative use of ancient languages and ultimately transform into a language beyond words. 
The ‘Soul Journey’ debut at Wits Theatre in Gauteng on the14th of November 2014 marks the beginning of Desert Rose’s shift toward an internationally recognized partnership with Waken Undaground which will serve to enrich the industry and allow further development of their collective and proudly South African brands both locally and internationally. 
As the debut performance draws near, Desert Rose, in collaboration with Waken Undaground, are simultaneously preparing for a world tour to Scotland, France and Ireland, scheduled for April/May 2015. 
The primary focus for the tour, running throughout April/May 2015, is to create an entry point and set the stage for the launch of our joint venture, ‘The OZ Project’. This initiative will engage on many levels as a global multi-cultural music, visual and performing arts exchange program which aims to dissolve artistic borders between South Africa, Ireland and France and launches officially 1st July 2015 in Dublin. 
Desert Rose’s return to the world stage will facilitate the momentum for the long term partnership goal to produce and disseminate music, promoting culture and encouraging processes for change. 
The Waken Undaground dream is as simple as it is ambitious, a global social organism operating within an artistic framework, representative of the diversity of the human family wherein each individual plays a crucial role in creating symmetry on every level. 
We aim to inspire a new world with our enterprise using collaboration as a tool for transformation, liquidating boundaries via music, art and dance and staying true to our relentless pursuit of global unity. One world, one nation , one heartbeat, one mind. 
We value your support and would love to hear from you should you wish to become involved in our projects or perhaps you would simply like to meet and greet to explore the art of opportunity whilst sharing ideas. 
  
Risks & Challenges 
Life as musicians is a beautiful struggle. We must keep the journey going not because of the guarantee but because of the possibility. As with any venture, our starting point is an absolute, unswerving devotion to our cause and a healthy dose of reality. 
In todays climate collaboration is key and in order to ensure our success we are partnering with Waken Undaground and many local and international artists in keeping with the philosophy that collectively we achieve so much more than we can individually. 
We are tremendously focused and each one of our team is equipped with the necessary skills to overcome any hurdles we may encounter as we pursue our long term vision which is dedicated to achieving peace through the exploration of multi-cultural music, visual and performing arts and the practical support of grassroots peace initiatives throughout the world.

<p>Hi, my name is <a href=""http://thewinterreiseproject.ca/faculty/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kathryn Whitney</a> and I'm the Artistic Director of the <a href=""http://www.thewinterreiseproject.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Winterreise Project</a> - a performance course for amateur pianists and singers over the age of 30 who are preparing a joint performance of Franz Schubert's 24-song cycle, Winter Journey (Winterreise).<br/>
</p>
<p>Schubert wrote almost all of his over 400 songs for amateur musicians - and yet they are performed almost exclusively by professionals today. The Winterreise Project reconnects Schubert's wonderful songs with their original, intended amateur performers. <br/></p>
<p>At the same time, the Winterreise Project offers amateur musicians rare access to professional-level training and the spotlight in which to perform as soloists - and it gives audiences the equally rare chance to hear them when they do. <br/></p>
<p>We hope you will consider supporting the Winterreise Project! <br/></p>
<p>Your donation will help make our course a success and you will ensure that we can continue in our campaign to provide high-quality song performance courses to adult amateur musicians in future.</p>

<br/>
<p></p>
<h3>What is the Winterreise Project and what do we do?</h3>
<p>The Winterreise Project is an intensive course, but it is also a 
pilot project. It is the first in what I hope will be many similar 
courses, all aimed at providing training and performance opportunities to amateur musicians over the age of 30. 
</p>
<p>Over a two and a half month period, the 34 students on the Winterreise 
Project meet every weekend for a series of masterclasses in which they learn to perform the songs in Schubert's cycle through intensive performance coaching with myself and with my colleague, the Russian-Canadian pianist, Anna Cal. Each student works on a minimum of four songs in masterclasses, and additionally each student takes four solo coachings and four duo coachings in 
pianist-singer pairs at other times during the week. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Pianist-singer duos are a key element in our project. Each student is matched with a number of duo 
partners so they can discover the songs together through both voice and 
keyboard, just as amateurs would have done in Schubert's lifetime. The mixing of partners lets students see how a different 
voice and a different touch on the keyboard can make for a very 
different song. It also helps our students to bond into chamber music partnerships that we hope will continue once the course is over.</p>

<p>We also have a number of auditor 
participants working with us on the course - these are song lovers who attend all our sessions as audience members, providing an interested group of sympathetic listeners, just as Schubert would have had in his many musical salon gatherings. <br/></p>
<p>At the end of the course, our performers come together to give a 
joint performance of the full 24-song cycle, with each pianist-singer pair contributing 
between one and three songs. </p>

<h3>How you can help - and our gifts of thanks to you!<br/>
</h3>
<p>We would be very grateful if you would consider helping us to make the Winterreise Project a success! <br/></p>
<p>As a pilot project, we kept our tuition low to encourage applications, in particular from people from all economic backgrounds. From the outset, we aimed to make up the difference needed to balance our budget through this fundraising initiative, which will help up meet some outstanding administrative costs.  <br/></p>
<p>Additionally, we are raising funds so that we can film our final concerts and pay for associated fees such as editing and DVD production. This film will be a welcome record of our work together, but its main purpose is to provide important footage for future grant applications for similar work. <br/></p>
<p>Work on the Winterreise Project is a labour of love for our staff, who put in hundreds of volunteer hours to make the course happen. Your gift can help us make this effort worthwhile by ensuring the project is financially as well as artistically viable, and by giving us the means to continue with our work. <br/></p>
<p>Your support will also help us lay a solid foundation on which to build future similar high-quality courses for amateur pianists and singers, and for music lovers.</p>

<h3>Our perks: something (musical) for everyone!</h3>
To express our thanks, and to provide you with a way to be more closely involved in the project through your donation, I have created a few <b>perks</b> which I hope you will find interesting. <br/><br/>As you will see, each of our perks is itself a form of performance - I hope you will find one that gets your heart singing, and brings you and your loved ones closer to Schubert and his poet Mueller, and to the heart of their beautiful songs.<br/><br/>First, we are offering companies or foundations the opportunity to partner with the Winterreise Project. For a gift of $1000 you can opt to have <b>Your Company Logo </b>displayed on the Winterreise Project website at <a href=""http://www.thewinterreiseproject.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thewinterreiseproject.ca</a>. We are looking forward to creating music together!<br/><br/>Second, we are offering you the chance to have <b>your very own Winterreise</b> performed by myself (Kathryn Whitney) and my colleague, pianist Anna Cal, for friends, family or colleagues - and this perk comes in two forms! <br/><br/>
</div><div>
<p>1. The 12-song Version. Schubert first published the first twelve songs of the cycle as a group and this 'original' 12-song version is often performed on its own. With a donation of $1200, you can claim a perk of a <b>Winterreise Concert (12-song) </b>version to be held in your own small venue. <br/></p>
<p>2. The 24-song Version. For a gift of $2000, you can claim <b>Your Own Winterreise Concert</b> - a performance of the full 24-song cycle that we know and love! <br/></p>
<p>Both concert perks will be performed live in your home or small venue on Vancouver Island. (Donor to provide piano. Donors to provide transportation and accommodation costs for performances outside Southern Vancouver Island. Thank you.)<br/></p>

</h3> <p>Your donation to the Winterreise Project supports our course, and is a strong vote of encouragement to our singers, pianists, and auditors who are working hard together to produce a performance of the highest possible quality. <br/></p>
<p>Your support also send an important message to our organizers and hosts - it is a vote of confidence in our decision to develop this quite unorthodox project, and will help us hugely to continue to develop similar projects for amateurs in future. <br/></p>
<p>Finally, you will help me personally to fulfill a dream to develop high-quality training of this kind for amateur soloists in my home country, Canada. Having lived and worked abroad, I've seen how warmly adult amateur musicians are embraced and provided for as valuable musicians in their own right in other countries. <br/></p>
<p>In Canada, we do very well at educating young musicians, and we have excellent career-track training program across the country. I would like to see Canadian funders, schools, and arts organizations broaden their scope to create greater opportunities for adult amateur musicians of all ages to have access to professional-level solo and chamber music training and performance projects that will challenge and inspire them. <br/></p>
<p>I want to build lasting, performance-based bridges between adult amateurs and the superb solo and small ensemble chamber music written for them. Schubert appreciated and supported amateur musicians through his projects and we can too.  Your donation will help me make this case especially strongly, and will help make this dream a reality!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Nico Rooney and David Ramlakhan originally founded YOUWANTIN in 2015, as an entertainment platform. Until recently, when they noticed a gap in the market for an urban artist development, media and promotions company. By contributing to this campaign you will be helping to further music careers and support our venture.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Founders</strong></h3>
<p>Nico Rooney is an entertainer / entrepreneur currently studying a BA Music Business (Hons) degree at BIMM London and Interning at The Orchard (Sony Music).

<p>Together we have built <strong>YOUWANTIN</strong>, allowing our creative industries to collaborate and empower unsigned artists. We are raising funds, which will allow us to develop an artist without having to charge them. One artist will WIN a development deal with us worth £1,000! and we will then be able to take the work we do with them, to investors and grant funders who may fund further artists through our platform.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are offering one lucky artist a chance to win a development deal with us worth £1,000. We need a minimum of £1234.75 to cover our start up business costs and fund our first artist development deal.

<p>*Indiegogo charges a 5-10% fee (we will be paying this fee).</p>
<p>Within our <u><i>Perks</i></u> section we are also offering some of our artist services before we launch with a 20% discount, allowing you to save some money. All of our contributors are encouraged to send us a screenshot of their contribution to <i><u>contact@youwantin.co.uk</u> </i>for some <strong>FREE</strong> tickets to our first YOUWANTIN showcase, date to be announced.</p>
<p>If we gain more funding than expected, we will fund another artist development deal and further our advertising for the company. If we don't reach our funding goal, we will continue to raise money through grant funders and investors.</p>
<p>Our next step is to approach the Arts Council for a grant, allowing us to fund more development deals for under privileged artist from communities around London. However these agencies don't give out funding unless there is a demand for our project and an amount raised prior to approaching them. This is why we need your help!</p>

<p>Your contribution will enable us to create and promote a single for an unsigned artist and allow us to build a portfolio, to use when pitching for grants.</p>
<p>We are building up a name within the urban music scene and believe that the services we offer will help elevate careers of urban unsigned artists.

<p>If you are unable to contribute by funding our project you can still help us spread the word, please share our campaign with your social network, friends and family but most importantly please share the campaign with any urban unsigned artists you know, as they may benefit from our services.</p>

</div><p>Thank you for taking your time out to read about our campaign we really appreciate it!</p><p><strong>YOUWANTIN</strong> - <u><i>The key to the industry</i></u></p></div>","We know how hard it is for unsigned artists to break through the music industry. The stress, demand and financial struggle to maintain a music career is challenging, but we are here to help you access the tools you need to take on the industry.
 
Summary
Nico Rooney and David Ramlakhan originally founded YOUWANTIN in 2015, as an entertainment platform. Until recently, when they noticed a gap in the market for an urban artist development, media and promotions company. By contributing to this campaign you will be helping to further music careers and support our venture.
 
The Founders
Nico Rooney is an entertainer / entrepreneur currently studying a BA Music Business (Hons) degree at BIMM London and Interning at The Orchard (Sony Music). Nico has performed at over 70 shows nationwide and scored a Top 20 on iTunes, managing various aspects of his career independently whilst helping other artists around him.
David Ramlakhan is a graduated videographer and editor from Ravensboure university. David has edited over 100 music videos to date and worked with Capital Radio, filming interviews with some of their celebrity clients. He has a passion for videography and music.
Together we have built YOUWANTIN, allowing our creative industries to collaborate and empower unsigned artists. We are raising funds, which will allow us to develop an artist without having to charge them. One artist will WIN a development deal with us worth £1,000! and we will then be able to take the work we do with them, to investors and grant funders who may fund further artists through our platform.
 

What We Need & What You Get
We are offering one lucky artist a chance to win a development deal with us worth £1,000. We need a minimum of £1234.75 to cover our start up business costs and fund our first artist development deal. We are willing to invest £534.75 of our own money into this project once we raise £700 through this campaign. Here is a break down of how the funding will be spent:
Artist Development (Ultimate Single Deal) - £1000

Songwriting - £100
Music Production - £100
Studio Time - £150
Mixing + Mastering - £70
Music Video - £200
Photoshoot - £90
Cover Art / Graphic Design - £70
Marketing / Promotion - £200
Distribution - £20

Business Start Up Costs - £234.75

Official Website (£9.24 x 24 Months) = £221.76
Register Company - £12.99


*Indiegogo charges a 5-10% fee (we will be paying this fee).
Within our Perks section we are also offering some of our artist services before we launch with a 20% discount, allowing you to save some money. All of our contributors are encouraged to send us a screenshot of their contribution to contact@youwantin.co.uk for some FREE tickets to our first YOUWANTIN showcase, date to be announced.
If we gain more funding than expected, we will fund another artist development deal and further our advertising for the company. If we don't reach our funding goal, we will continue to raise money through grant funders and investors.
Our next step is to approach the Arts Council for a grant, allowing us to fund more development deals for under privileged artist from communities around London. However these agencies don't give out funding unless there is a demand for our project and an amount raised prior to approaching them. This is why we need your help!
 

The Impact
Your contribution will enable us to create and promote a single for an unsigned artist and allow us to build a portfolio, to use when pitching for grants.
We are building up a name within the urban music scene and believe that the services we offer will help elevate careers of urban unsigned artists. By contributing to our campaign you will also be helping to fund for our official website. Once our website is launched, we will be offering various services to unsigned artists here is a list of our services:

FREE artist consultations
FREE blog features
Music production (producing, songwriting, recording, mixing and mastering)
Video production (managing, directing, editing and grading)
Royalty collection
Marketing and promotion
Distribution (iTunes, Spotify, MTV, VEVO + more)
Branding (graphic design, cover art, merchandise, photoshoots + more)
Event management (gigs, tours, launch parties)

<h3>The Goal...</h3>
<p>Hi guys</p>
<p>Last year we clubbed together to raise enough money to record my first professional EP: 'I Was Waiting'. I could never have done this myself and it's amazing to be sat here a year on with a completed, professional product in my hand, and one that you seem to all love so much.</p>
<p>The next step is to release a single from the EP and give it the best chance of being received by critics, press, radio and the wider world.</p>
<p>There are two key ways to do this.</p>
<p>Firstly, with a music video.</p>
<p>Secondly, with a PR campaign - a campaign that revolves around pitching the track to blogs, radio, press etc.</p>
<p>Now, fortunately, due to support I have so far received, I have been able to fund the PR campaign myself. The deposit is paid and the campaign is scheduled for release early November.</p>
<p>Where I need your help now is in funding the music video to bring the whole thing to life.</p>
<p>After much advertisement and 12 different pitches, at the very last moment, Harry came through with his script (15 minutes prior to the deadline i'd set for submissions!). He is a fantastic director and one that believes in the song as much as we do. As a result he is directing and editing the video totally free of charge.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>As well as a director working for free, I have also recruited my school-friend and pro-actor James McNicholas to play the role of the evil illusionist. He too has agreed to do this for free! </p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the remaining costs involved. As you will see it totals £1,010.00:</p>
<p>£300 - location </p>
<p>£80 - Actress </p>
<p>£80 - camera/lighting assistant </p>
<p>£100 - make up artist (inc expenses) </p>
<p>£150 - costume designer, inc costume budget </p>
<p>£150 - props </p>
<p>£50 - consumables </p>
<p>£100 - transport + catering</p>
<h3>What I Can Give You In Return</h3>
<p>I have a host of fun and exciting exclusives to give you in return for your contributions, from access to the video script, to dedicated personal studio recordings. </p>

<h1>Qui je suis ?<br/>
</h1>
<p>Née dans un village des Chaudières Appalaches, j’ai su dès mon plus jeune âge apprécier la beauté de la simplicité.  La photographie a toujours été présente dans ma vie et j’ai appris à jongler avec cette dernière, d’abord par pur plaisir.<br/></p>
<p>Lorsque venu le temps de choisir un métier, j’ai opté
pour le design de mode qui s’est plutôt avéré comme étant un beau passe-temps.
Quelques années plus tard, après une tentative d’études en design graphique, la
révélation m'est apparue: je vis que pour la photographie!   J’aime figer dans
le temps des souvenirs, des émotions et une personnalité propre à chaque image.</p>
<p>Automne 2011, le début d’une belle aventure, je me
suis inscrite dans un DEP en photographie, puis en hiver 2012, le cours de
lancement d’entreprise m’attendait à bras ouverts.   Je pratique la
photographie depuis 2010 avec beaucoup d'admiration pour mes sujets; passionnée
par toute forme d'art, j'adore tout ce qui touche à la culture.<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/llamaryon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Festivals, spectacles de musique, danse, théâtre, photos de casting, mode locale</a><a href=""www.facebook.com/llamaryon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a>, tout pour faire briller la créativité.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Je rêve à l’Islande depuis plus de 10 ans maintenant.
Je suis passionnée par leur culture, leur musique, leurs paysages et leur
climat typique. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Je n’avais jamais voyagé, j’essayais d’économiser pour
visiter ce pays. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Je me suis rendue à l’évidence: c'est vrai ce qu'on
dit des premières années d'une entreprise. Les profits ne sont pas au
rendez-vous et la vie de travailleur autonome ne me permettrait pas de mettre
des sous de côté avant plusieurs années. Mais l'Islande me hante toujours,
encore plus depuis l'acquisition de ma formation en photographie. J’ai donc
décidé d'utiliser ce qu’il me restait des prestations reçues, suite à un
accident de vélo, étant jeune, pour m'y rendre.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Le 28 mai je quittais mon emploi à temps partiel pour
me consacrer qu’à la photographie ! Par le fait même, j'ai pris place dans un avion me menant
tout droit à l’aéroport de Keflavik, Islande, les larmes aux yeux devant toute
cette beauté.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439438646/lfvuuypcwvnes2zjyrrc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><h3><b><br/></b></h3><h1><b>Mon projet</b></h1>À mon retour de voyage, je me suis inscrite au projet <a href=""http://www.emploiquebec.gouv.qc.ca/citoyens/developper-et-faire-reconnaitre-vos-competences/preparation-a-lemploi/jeunes-volontaires/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.emploiquebec.gouv.qc.ca/citoyens/developper-et-faire-reconnaitre-vos-competences/preparation-a-lemploi/jeunes-volontaires/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jeunes Volontaires</a> afin de réaliser une exposition de grande ampleur me permettant
d’avoir un statut d’artiste professionnelle. Les fonds accordés ne semblaient
pas suffisants pour ma nouvelle condition de travailleur autonome à temps plein et pour ce que je voulais accomplir avec mon exposition mais j’allais y arriver... <br/><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Au début de juillet je partais pour le premier festival d’une longue liste: le<a href=""http://www.festivoix.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Festivoix</a> . Peu après mon arrivée à Trois-Rivières, mon appareil photo se retrouve malgré moi au sol, dans une flaque d’eau. Le boitier et l'objectif doivent être réparés, je les perds pendant un mois, en pleine période de contrats et déjà appauvrie par mon voyage en Islande. On me prête un appareil, je loue un objectif et j’en achète un autre; mais je me vois dans l'obligation de me faire remplacer pour un mandat important. Les plans de mon été sont désormais fortement affectés et mon emploi de photographe est mis en jeu.<br/></span></p><p>
</p><p>Aujourd’hui je me retrouve dans un situation très, très précaire avec un beau problème cette fois; celui d’être acceptée pour couvrir le renommé festival de musique <a href=""http://icelandairwaves.is"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://icelandairwaves.is/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iceland Airwaves</a> pour un journal Islandais.

<h1>Pourquoi contribuer ?</h1>
<p>1. Je gravite dans la ville de Québec depuis maintenant 6 ans, appareil à la main, avec une passion énorme pour mon métier, en aidant la créativité et le talent d’ici à se démarquer. Ainsi, de façon bénévole, je mets mon appareil et mon temps, au service d’une communauté musicale qui n’a pas beaucoup de budget. Ces artistes émergents gagnent ainsi la visibilité dont ils ont besoin. Sans cette campagne, je devrai me résigner à me retrouver un emploi et ainsi devoir consacrer moins de temps à la photographie.</p>

</div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><p>3. En me procurant votre aide pour l’achat d’un matériel adéquat, vous vous assurez d'une qualité d’image et de la fiabilité du matériel utilisé lors d’un futur mandat, en votre compagnie. De plus, mes dernières malchances m'ont convaincue que d’avoir du matériel de rechange était essentiel !</p>
<p>4. Je songe à mon exposition sur l’Islande depuis presque aussi longtemps que je fais de la photographie.

<p></p></div>","Qui je suis ?

Née dans un village des Chaudières Appalaches, j’ai su dès mon plus jeune âge apprécier la beauté de la simplicité.  La photographie a toujours été présente dans ma vie et j’ai appris à jongler avec cette dernière, d’abord par pur plaisir.
Lorsque venu le temps de choisir un métier, j’ai opté
pour le design de mode qui s’est plutôt avéré comme étant un beau passe-temps.
Quelques années plus tard, après une tentative d’études en design graphique, la
révélation m'est apparue: je vis que pour la photographie!   J’aime figer dans
le temps des souvenirs, des émotions et une personnalité propre à chaque image.
Automne 2011, le début d’une belle aventure, je me
suis inscrite dans un DEP en photographie, puis en hiver 2012, le cours de
lancement d’entreprise m’attendait à bras ouverts.   Je pratique la
photographie depuis 2010 avec beaucoup d'admiration pour mes sujets; passionnée
par toute forme d'art, j'adore tout ce qui touche à la culture. Festivals, spectacles de musique, danse, théâtre, photos de casting, mode locale, tout pour faire briller la créativité.
Je rêve à l’Islande depuis plus de 10 ans maintenant.
Je suis passionnée par leur culture, leur musique, leurs paysages et leur
climat typique. 
Je n’avais jamais voyagé, j’essayais d’économiser pour
visiter ce pays. Je me suis rendue à l’évidence: c'est vrai ce qu'on
dit des premières années d'une entreprise. Les profits ne sont pas au
rendez-vous et la vie de travailleur autonome ne me permettrait pas de mettre
des sous de côté avant plusieurs années. Mais l'Islande me hante toujours,
encore plus depuis l'acquisition de ma formation en photographie. J’ai donc
décidé d'utiliser ce qu’il me restait des prestations reçues, suite à un
accident de vélo, étant jeune, pour m'y rendre.

Le 28 mai je quittais mon emploi à temps partiel pour
me consacrer qu’à la photographie ! Par le fait même, j'ai pris place dans un avion me menant
tout droit à l’aéroport de Keflavik, Islande, les larmes aux yeux devant toute
cette beauté.Mon projetÀ mon retour de voyage, je me suis inscrite au projet Jeunes Volontaires afin de réaliser une exposition de grande ampleur me permettant
d’avoir un statut d’artiste professionnelle. Les fonds accordés ne semblaient
pas suffisants pour ma nouvelle condition de travailleur autonome à temps plein et pour ce que je voulais accomplir avec mon exposition mais j’allais y arriver... Au début de juillet je partais pour le premier festival d’une longue liste: le Festivoix . Peu après mon arrivée à Trois-Rivières, mon appareil photo se retrouve malgré moi au sol, dans une flaque d’eau. Le boitier et l'objectif doivent être réparés, je les perds pendant un mois, en pleine période de contrats et déjà appauvrie par mon voyage en Islande. On me prête un appareil, je loue un objectif et j’en achète un autre; mais je me vois dans l'obligation de me faire remplacer pour un mandat important. Les plans de mon été sont désormais fortement affectés et mon emploi de photographe est mis en jeu.
Aujourd’hui je me retrouve dans un situation très, très précaire avec un beau problème cette fois; celui d’être acceptée pour couvrir le renommé festival de musique Iceland Airwaves pour un journal Islandais.
Par le fait même, j’en profiterais pour aller dans l’autre moitié inexplorée du
pays afin de présenter une exposition plus complète.5000$ - 3 objectifs
Ayant déjà dû emprunter un montant maximum à la fin de mes études pour l'achat de mes outils de travail (ordinateur, appareil photo, flash, objectifs…) je ne dispose pas des liquidités pour payer ces sommes inattendues. Afin de pouvoir continuer à faire ce métier, présenter une exposition à la hauteur de mes attentes et réaliser ce rêve complètement fou (voir inespéré) d'être photographe à un festival de musique en Islande j'ai besoin de ces sous pour: 
Payer le bris de mon appareil photo et achat de matériel supplémentaire
Frais de réparation de l’objectif: 400$Frais de réparation du boîtier : 550$Boîtier en surplus: Minimum de 2000$Objectif spécialisé pour le spectacle: 1 500$
Réaliser une expositionImpression photo et matériel: 1 500$Local d’exposition: Minimum de 300$Publicité: 150$Vernissage: 150$
Participer au Iceland Airwaves 
Passe média: 150$Location chambre: 500$Avion: 1000$Location voiture: 1000$

Comme vous pouvez le constater, peu importe le montant
amassé, il est certain que cet argent sera bien utilisé et que la somme de
5000$ n’est pas suffisante pour couvrir tout ces frais. Votre contribution est donc fortement appréciée ! 



Gâteries !
Comme la tradition le veut avec Indiegogo, chaque don est accompagné d’un petit bonheur; j'ai donc créé quelque items spécialement pour l'occasion. 
MacaronPetit macaron de 1,5"" de forme carré avec un paysage typiquement islandais ainsi qu'une salutation islandaise.


                                 

Affiches 11x17 et 16x24Il vous sera possible de choisir une photo parmi cette sélection ou même un coup de coeur que vous auriez eu auparavant en regardant mon travail. Ces dernières seront imprimées sur un papier très fin pour reproduire un fini ""poster"" mat.
Cadre ""dollie"" 8x10Le choix devra être fait parmi cette sélection. 



         

*** À noter que l'achat des items (excepté les macarons) exclus la livraison postale  mais qu'il me sera possible de vous livrer le tout en main propre dans les alentours de la ville de Québec et ce sans frais supplémentaire. Si vous êtes de l'extérieur, le coût devra être évalué avec poste canada.Surveillez vos email, je vous écrirai pour valider votre choix d'image ! 



Services de photographieVous pouvez aussi contribuer à ce projet tout en ayant
l'opportunité de payer à l’avance, à prix réduit, une séance photo ! Il s'agit d'un prix spécial pour la campagne, aucun choix de photos n'est à faire, je traite et vous envoie ce qui est bon. Le montant exclus les retouches autres que celles de base, du temps supplémentaire lors de la séance, de même qu'un déplacement de plus de 70km.

Pourquoi contribuer ?
1. Je gravite dans la ville de Québec depuis maintenant 6 ans, appareil à la main, avec une passion énorme pour mon métier, en aidant la créativité et le talent d’ici à se démarquer. Ainsi, de façon bénévole, je mets mon appareil et mon temps, au service d’une communauté musicale qui n’a pas beaucoup de budget. Ces artistes émergents gagnent ainsi la visibilité dont ils ont besoin. Sans cette campagne, je devrai me résigner à me retrouver un emploi et ainsi devoir consacrer moins de temps à la photographie.
2. Je couvre depuis 6 ans le Festival OFF de Québec, 5 ans le Festival de cinéma de la ville de Québec et une première expérience au Festival d’été de Québec pour le Voir. Une participation au Iceland Airwaves serait un excellent tremplin pour ma carrière et un ajout de taille à mon curriculum vitae !

3. En me procurant votre aide pour l’achat d’un matériel adéquat, vous vous assurez d'une qualité d’image et de la fiabilité du matériel utilisé lors d’un futur mandat, en votre compagnie. De plus, mes dernières malchances m'ont convaincue que d’avoir du matériel de rechange était essentiel !
4. Je songe à mon exposition sur l’Islande depuis presque aussi longtemps que je fais de la photographie. Les idées bouillonnent et je vous promets qu’elle sera très différente de ce à quoi on s'attend de ce genre d’évènement. Pour se faire, j’ai absolument besoin de ressources financières supplémentaires: vous ne serez pas déçus!
5. J’ai eu beau essayer divers domaines d’études, des emplois dans des milieux différents, faire des tests d’orientation fréquents dans le but de trouver un métier avec l'assurance d'un meilleur salaire… rien n'y fait, il y a seulement la photographie pour me passionner autant !



Risques ?Il n'y en a aucun. Si la totalité du montant n’est pas amassé, je ne m'envolerai sans doute pas vers l’Islande pour une deuxième fois. Je devrai tout de même remplacer tout ce beau matériel et une exposition se tiendra: mais elle ne sera pas aussi élaborée que je l'avais pensée !Vous aimeriez m'aider mais vous avez vous même envie de voyager ou auriez besoin d’une campagne de financement pour payer votre épicerie ?

<h3>THE OPPORTUNITY</h3>
<p>On April 21 and 22, we will bring our work-in-progress to audiences at JACK, an obie-winning performance venue in Brooklyn.  Our mission: </p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate new music generated last year in Chicago with the script, presenting a music-driven story, inspired by Afrofuturism, house music, and the queer black experience. </li>
<li>Test our dance party / live theater concept. A DJ on board with our team of theater and music artists, we will blend the show with a dance party experience. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is an ambitious project on limited funds. And we've got an awesome team lined up. With your support, the magic will happen. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>YOUR TAX-DEDUCTIBLE CONTRIBUTION AT WORK</h3>
<p>We're working from a small budget and seeking $10,000 to offset production expenses, primarily the modest stipends we're offering to the team:  our nine performers, general manager, stage manager, costume/wardrobe/make up, transportation, food, you get the picture.</p>
<p>Every little bit helps, and our team is rolling up their sleeves to make sure donors feel the love. That means our perks include everything from personalized serenades and styling consultations to customized social media shade for that special someone.  </p>
<p>In the meantime, our team is activating all sorts of resources to make Bring the Beat Back happen.   We've helped keep the budget lean with some key supporters:</p>
<p>The Drama League - our director, Christopher Burris, received a residency for the project just in time to help us save money on rehearsal space and other admin costs. </p>
<p>The National Black Theatre - our playwright, Derek Lee McPhatter, is currently an I AM Soul Resident Playwright at The National Black Theatre in Harlem, which hosted our first round of auditions and is also providing some administrative support.  </p>
<p>Under the Spell Productions, Inc., is managing the money stuff. It's a 501c3 non-profit organization. So that means your gift is tax-deductible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>YOUR IMPACT</h3>
<p>Your support will do more than help keep the bills paid. It will demonstrate the diversity of the communities in support of Bring the Beat Back.  </p>
<p>The story we're telling is specific. It reflects many of our playwright's challenges coming of age as a black gay male (and sci-fi geek). But the struggles in the show are shared by many team members, some black, some queer, some sci-fi fans, and some are none of the above.</p>
<p>But all of us have found something resonant about Bring the Beat Back and we believe you will too.  Your support will be a powerful demonstration of what becomes possible when we celebrate the diversity of our experiences.  </p>
<p>Plus its gonna be tons of fun.</p>
<p>And success with the show in 2017, means we'll be able to do more of it very soon.  Maybe even bring a touring version to a theater (or night club) near you! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>There aren't very many queer, black, sci-fi, music-theater extravaganzas out there for us to learn from, so we're definitely charting our own path. Does this show go to Broadway? Should it evolve underground? We're not sure, but the April presentations will help us figure that out. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>OTHER WAYS TO HELP</h3>
<p>We know times are hard. And $$ is just part of the plan.  There are lots of ways you can show your support: </p>
<ul>
<li>Make your Voice Heard - Tell everyone you know about Bring the Beat Back.</li>
<li>Contact us for volunteer opportunities - we are in need of some volunteer help for the Brooklyn show - in stage management, transportation, and other areas. Inbox us! </li>

So, the main issue to solve is how to come to Europe and the expenses during the tour, its all about the budge. You know, as independent musician is not easy, I already spent a lot of money on independent's production (EP's, Album Debut),  and now also on promotion services for my first Album. It would be great if you can support this project, and also why not, we can meet in some of the venues in Europe :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Let's Do It Together  </h3>
<p>The main issue to make it real, and rock with my band in Europe is the cost of <strong>Flight Tickets</strong> from South America to Europe, and the <strong>Accommodation Fees</strong> during the tour.</p>
<p>For that reason, I have some awesome perks for you: Digital Album Download Link, Signed CD, Entry Tickets, Collection Box, Meet &amp; Greet , and Acoustic House Concerts.</p>
<p><strong>Let's do it together, this project will cost around USD 8,500 to make it happen:</strong></p>
<p>- Flight Tickets Buenos x4: USD 7300</p>
<p>- Accommodation: USD 1200</p>
<p>Finally, if <strong>we don't reach the entire goal</strong>, but if we reach at least 80%, I could be able to manage and invest the rest and make it. Otherwise we can use part of this money for the production of hard copies &amp; merchandising to deliver to the contributors.</p>

Everyone that contributes, you have no idea how thankful I am. Every donation goes such a long way towards this album and I am so excited for all of you to be apart of my journey.

<div>Earlier this year I wrote (and finished) songs during a solo month-long journey on a  musical adventure down south. I got home more inspired than I've EVER been. And I knew what had to be done next... I found an EXCELLENT producer here in Rochester to help the songs come alive and I couldn't be more excited about how they sound!</div>
<div>I've invested my life in music. I've been around it since I was born.

I've even dedicated my day job to supporting musicians, supporting their musical souls and fatigued muscles.</div> <p>I know with absolute certainty that I need to follow my dreams to play music, travel and perform as much as the fates allow.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the loving and awesome band I play with (The Crawdiddies) aren't up to travel as much as I'd like and what I know is that I MUST! <b>This album represents me being able to go out on my own and make things happen!!</b> This is an investment in my future so I have something on the road that I can sell and support myself with as I travel and play music!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get!</h3>

<div>SUPPORTING THE SPIRIT OF CREATING ORIGINAL MUSIC!</div> </div> <div> <h3>Connection</h3> <p>I want this album to inspire an emotional connection.  I'm calling it<b> House of Healing </b>for many reasons. As i've come to concretely realize through the profession of massage therapy, we all know someone (or are someone) with an illness. Weather it be physical, mental or emotional, doesn't matter, everyone is going through something incredibly painful.... AND the worst part,  is that it is usually only acceptably talked about behind closed doors. The healing happens when the wound is recognized and supported. <b>These songs were written to support the spirit to continue on. </b></p>

<p>I'm dedicated to music, weather it's me busking on the streets or going to an open mic or booking shows in different cities, I know i can get my music out there the old fashion way. <b>This is the first step!</b></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> As an artist I'm opening my raw self, my emotional baggage, my feelings of hope (and insecurity) inside this record and within this campaign because I believe in communication and the strength of the human spirit. </p>
<p>I took a giant leap of faith in making this record knowing that I'd be able to pay for it weather by small donations, benevolent patrons or paying it off in time. I believe in putting myself and this CD out there enough to do that.<b> My goal is to raise money in 30 days!  </b></p>

I've even dedicated my day job to supporting musicians, supporting their musical souls and fatigued muscles. I know with absolute certainty that I need to follow my dreams to play music, travel and perform as much as the fates allow.
Unfortunately, the loving and awesome band I play with (The Crawdiddies) aren't up to travel as much as I'd like and what I know is that I MUST! This album represents me being able to go out on my own and make things happen!! This is an investment in my future so I have something on the road that I can sell and support myself with as I travel and play music!   What I Need & What You Get!
Money (check)  time (check) and soul (check) are invested, now I need help completing it! 

$1000  Remainder of the studio time with producer
$1000 Physical distribution costs to print CDs with a reliable company 

$300 Everything to do with the art and hosting the accompanying art show (book                  binding, supplies, room rental)   I'd love to employ a professional local          artist and friend to help me book bind the art for you!

$200 shipping expenses and indiegogo platform

...in exchange for...
THIS AWESOME ALBUM FULL OF SPIRIT!!
Cool things in the ""GALLERY"" AND ""PERKS""
THE GREAT FEELING OF SUPPORTING A CREATIVE ARTIST AND FRIEND!
SUPPORTING THE SPIRIT OF CREATING ORIGINAL MUSIC!   Connection I want this album to inspire an emotional connection.  I'm calling it House of Healing for many reasons. As i've come to concretely realize through the profession of massage therapy, we all know someone (or are someone) with an illness. Weather it be physical, mental or emotional, doesn't matter, everyone is going through something incredibly painful.... AND the worst part,  is that it is usually only acceptably talked about behind closed doors. The healing happens when the wound is recognized and supported. These songs were written to support the spirit to continue on. 
It's my hope that the CD can remind listeners of our compassion, of our strength and of the mysterious qualities of the universe. 
I'm dedicated to music, weather it's me busking on the streets or going to an open mic or booking shows in different cities, I know i can get my music out there the old fashion way. This is the first step!   Risks & Challenges
 As an artist I'm opening my raw self, my emotional baggage, my feelings of hope (and insecurity) inside this record and within this campaign because I believe in communication and the strength of the human spirit. 
I took a giant leap of faith in making this record knowing that I'd be able to pay for it weather by small donations, benevolent patrons or paying it off in time. I believe in putting myself and this CD out there enough to do that. My goal is to raise money in 30 days!  
    Talk talk talk about it!

If you can't contribute that doesn't mean you can't help. Please consider sharing this on your page. I'll be littering your news feed in the next month on facebook and playing shows around town.

<p>Timothy Francis:</p>
<p>Timothy attended the Victoria Conservatory of Music on full
scholarship and studied composition, theory, and piano. He won their
composition contest every year he was in attendance, open to composers from
anywhere in Canada and was twice awarded their most prestigious scholarship.
Before graduating, he lectured on Shostakovich for the Victoria Symphony, and
taught classes in harmony, music history, and theory. He has worked with Pacific
Opera Victoria for their Libretto Laboratory (LibLab), after being selected
from composers across Canada. Shortly after graduation his work “For
Wordsworth” for orchestra and tenor was premiered at Carnegie Hall, NYC by the
New York Pops and went on to several other performances in North America
notably the Vancouver Opera Orchestra at a concert at the Orpheum Theatre and
on a cross Canada tour by tenor Ken Lavigne. His song cycles have been song
internationally as well as in Canada in competitions, concerts, and
masterclasses. He has performed as a pianist in jazz festivals across British
Columbia and toured internationally performing along the West Coast from
Vancouver to San Diego. His music has been called “a worthy re-examination of
the practice of Berg and Webern looked at through a 21<sup>st</sup> century
lens” and his songs as “grateful to and for the voices that sang them”. Films
featuring his music have premiered to acclaim in Victoria, Vancouver, Montreal,
and Berlin film festivals.</p>

of compositions written for her unique rich alto voice.  Over the recent years, Cari has focused on
developing  ‘Dramatic Gypsy Cabaret’
music as a theme into her performance creations. Most recently Cari was

SNP MSP - but where, since 1997, Michael Moore (LibDem) has offered no

need to keep the Tories out – and that , despite his attempt at camouflage,
is John Lamont. <strong><span>We know that Calum Kerr</span></strong>,for the SNP,<strong> will really represent the folk who live here</strong>. 
Now we need your help with the campaign to get Calum elected to work for
us all.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We
aim to raise enough to make our presence visible in all our
communities and to get out the information so everyone can see
the real benefit of voting SNP, so we can <strong>elect Calum Kerr - a Borders MP who'll focus on
our whole constituency</strong>, towns and villages, farmlands and fishing ports, businesses and colleges.  He's got plans for boosting our area with the creation and promotion of <strong>Scottish Borders - The Brand </strong>- at last an MP to make  Berwickshire, Roxburgh &amp; Selkirk really count.</p>
<p>If we
raise more money than our target, we’ll just be able to do a better job, building an SNP team in Berwickshire, Roxburgh &amp; Selkirk to work for all the Borders.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Berwickshire, Roxburgh &amp; Selkirk is a huge area and it will
make a real difference to have a campaign budget that allows us to
reach every part of the constituency.  We need premises, publicity materials,

raise funds, which is where you come in…</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Michael Moore's majority looks set to crumble - but we need to help it on its way. We need to make sure that the thousands of voters disappointed by Moore's Westminster government, get the chance to see how Calum Kerr and the SNP can work successfully for their futures here in the Borders.  We need your support to make that certain - by electing

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div style=""text-align: center;""> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hey everyone!  Thanks for clicking through to our Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>Christian from Transvaal Diamond Syndicate here.  I've probably met most of you over the last 6 years of hectic touring.  The band has chalked up some 250,000kms and done close to 1000 all-original gigs!  For those of you we haven't met... WELCOME.<br/></p>
<p>We're looking to raise enough money over the next 40 days to help pay for our brand new double EP to be released later this year.  This project is a different one for us.  We're actually going to acknowledge the different influences within the band and release a Blues-focused EP and a Riff-Rock-focused EP.  Until now we've been hitting you somewhere in the middle!</p>
<p>This will see us travel down to Sydney to record the Rockier EP with Daniel Antix (Gay Paris) at the new <i>Def Wolf Studios</i> and team up with Phil Graham (Head of Music QUT) at <i>Gasworks Studio</i> in Brisbane for the Bluesy EP.</p>
<p>A double EP/album is an expensive exercise, one that ideally we'd fund ourselves, but with all this touring and endless driving we basically come home to empty pockets.  We've never asked for help before but feel that this is the right time to involve our fans, friends and family.<br/></p>
<p>The project will cost us around $15,000 all up, we're hoping to raise $10,000 with help from you legends.<br/></p> <ul></ul> <p>Of course you'll get something rad in return!  We have a range of rewards and experiences on offer which will certainly make it worth your while.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>The specific budget breakdown for our new release is something like this:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>RECORDING AND MIXING - $7500</li>
<li>MASTERING - $1500</li>
<li>PRESSING - $1500</li>
<li>VINYL - $2500</li>
<li>MERCHANDISE (Tees and Caps) - $500</li>
<li>PUBLICITY AND PROMOTION - $1500</li>
<li><b>TOTAL: $15,000</b></li>
</ul>
<p>We're hoping to raise at least 10k of the total to mix with our band savings and make this bad boy a reality!</p>
<p>Any excess money raised will go towards extra publicity and promotions along with postage costs associated with the rewards and the travel costs involved in recording.</p>
<p>If we don't make our target we will pool what money we have into getting just the first EP part-recorded.<br/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What You Get</h3>Different levels of contribution get different levels of reward.<br/><br/>You can buy the double EP with a digital download or step it up and order it on vinyl (we're excited about this).  Maybe you want a live gig at your house or you want Juzzy to cook you dinner (he's done that for some of you already haha).  Maybe you want to splash out and purchase one of the guitars used by the band or buy a unique portrait of one of the band members by a renowned artist...<br/><br/>We've tried to put fair $ amounts next to all of the rewards so it's wins all 'round.  <br/> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>For the last 6 years we've been releasing and touring material around Australia.  In that time we've:</p>
<ul>
<li>regularly featured in the top 10 most requested tracks on Australian community radio (AMRAP)</li>
<li>had 4 songs played on Triple J</li>
<li>Been in the Top 10 singles charts on iTunes (Blues)</li>
<li>Won 'Song of the Year' award at the QLD Blues Awards</li>
<li>Top 5 at the MusicOz Awards (Blues and Roots)</li>
<li>Won an Independent Music Award (Blues Song Category)</li>
<li>Taken out 4 top 20 slots on 4ZzZ annual Hot 100 List</li>
<li>Had a bunch of 4 and 5 star album reviews (inc. Sydney Morning Herald, The Courier Mail, Zoo Magazine, The Music)<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I guess we know what we're doing is relevant and people are vibing off it... Otherwise we probably would have stopped ages ago!  You guys give us constant feedback to keep us motivated.  High fives all 'round.<br/></p>
<p>We know that this release will be our best and most expansive work yet and we're really pumped to start the recording process and get the finished product into your hands and ears.  Every $ you help us with honestly goes straight into the direct expenses involved in the project.</p>
<p>We have 2 x 6week tours planned with a bunch of dates through QLD, NSW, VIC, WA and NT (first trip to WA and NT!) for the rest of the year including a few festival shows.  We'd love to hit the road with a new double-release to show you.<br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> For those of you who've met us on the road, fed us, put us up, bought us a beer or two... you'll know that we live pretty thin.  Touring for the last 5 years around Australia has been awesome.  We've met so many amazing people who will be mates for life.  But the reality is that all this touring leaves us full of stories but with empty wallets.  It's a challenge for us when we return from tour and have to fish around for work and try and get back to a 'normal' way of living after spending some 10 months on the road per year in the past.  We made a decision a while back that music and connecting with people was to come first but this is a daily struggle as the Arts don't pay much.<br/></p>
<p>The reality is that it's like that for most of your favourite bands.  We all toil away behind the scenes, living thin and wearing ourselves out in the name of Australian Music.  You guys usually only see us when we hit your local and it's all fun and games, but times that by 10mths of the year for at least 5 years and it can be a big challenge to stay motivated/healthy and in some sort of positive financial position.<br/></p>
<p>We're hoping you can help us get this project off the ground so we can visit you with something new reeeaallll soon.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know not everyone has enough money for a new album but there are a couple of other ways you can help out:<br/></p>

Christian from Transvaal Diamond Syndicate here.  I've probably met most of you over the last 6 years of hectic touring.  The band has chalked up some 250,000kms and done close to 1000 all-original gigs!  For those of you we haven't met... WELCOME.
We're looking to raise enough money over the next 40 days to help pay for our brand new double EP to be released later this year.  This project is a different one for us.  We're actually going to acknowledge the different influences within the band and release a Blues-focused EP and a Riff-Rock-focused EP.  Until now we've been hitting you somewhere in the middle!
This will see us travel down to Sydney to record the Rockier EP with Daniel Antix (Gay Paris) at the new Def Wolf Studios and team up with Phil Graham (Head of Music QUT) at Gasworks Studio in Brisbane for the Bluesy EP.
A double EP/album is an expensive exercise, one that ideally we'd fund ourselves, but with all this touring and endless driving we basically come home to empty pockets.  We've never asked for help before but feel that this is the right time to involve our fans, friends and family.
The project will cost us around $15,000 all up, we're hoping to raise $10,000 with help from you legends.  Of course you'll get something rad in return!  We have a range of rewards and experiences on offer which will certainly make it worth your while.
   What We Need The specific budget breakdown for our new release is something like this:

RECORDING AND MIXING - $7500
MASTERING - $1500
PRESSING - $1500
VINYL - $2500
MERCHANDISE (Tees and Caps) - $500
PUBLICITY AND PROMOTION - $1500
TOTAL: $15,000

We're hoping to raise at least 10k of the total to mix with our band savings and make this bad boy a reality!
Any excess money raised will go towards extra publicity and promotions along with postage costs associated with the rewards and the travel costs involved in recording.
If we don't make our target we will pool what money we have into getting just the first EP part-recorded.

What You GetDifferent levels of contribution get different levels of reward.You can buy the double EP with a digital download or step it up and order it on vinyl (we're excited about this).  Maybe you want a live gig at your house or you want Juzzy to cook you dinner (he's done that for some of you already haha).  Maybe you want to splash out and purchase one of the guitars used by the band or buy a unique portrait of one of the band members by a renowned artist...We've tried to put fair $ amounts next to all of the rewards so it's wins all 'round.     
The Impact For the last 6 years we've been releasing and touring material around Australia.  In that time we've:

regularly featured in the top 10 most requested tracks on Australian community radio (AMRAP)
had 4 songs played on Triple J
Been in the Top 10 singles charts on iTunes (Blues)
Won 'Song of the Year' award at the QLD Blues Awards
Top 5 at the MusicOz Awards (Blues and Roots)
Won an Independent Music Award (Blues Song Category)
Taken out 4 top 20 slots on 4ZzZ annual Hot 100 List
Had a bunch of 4 and 5 star album reviews (inc. Sydney Morning Herald, The Courier Mail, Zoo Magazine, The Music)


So I guess we know what we're doing is relevant and people are vibing off it... Otherwise we probably would have stopped ages ago!  You guys give us constant feedback to keep us motivated.  High fives all 'round.
We know that this release will be our best and most expansive work yet and we're really pumped to start the recording process and get the finished product into your hands and ears.  Every $ you help us with honestly goes straight into the direct expenses involved in the project.
We have 2 x 6week tours planned with a bunch of dates through QLD, NSW, VIC, WA and NT (first trip to WA and NT!) for the rest of the year including a few festival shows.  We'd love to hit the road with a new double-release to show you.    
Risks & Challenges  For those of you who've met us on the road, fed us, put us up, bought us a beer or two... you'll know that we live pretty thin.  Touring for the last 5 years around Australia has been awesome.  We've met so many amazing people who will be mates for life.  But the reality is that all this touring leaves us full of stories but with empty wallets.  It's a challenge for us when we return from tour and have to fish around for work and try and get back to a 'normal' way of living after spending some 10 months on the road per year in the past.  We made a decision a while back that music and connecting with people was to come first but this is a daily struggle as the Arts don't pay much.
The reality is that it's like that for most of your favourite bands.  We all toil away behind the scenes, living thin and wearing ourselves out in the name of Australian Music.  You guys usually only see us when we hit your local and it's all fun and games, but times that by 10mths of the year for at least 5 years and it can be a big challenge to stay motivated/healthy and in some sort of positive financial position.
We're hoping you can help us get this project off the ground so we can visit you with something new reeeaallll soon.

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<div>
<br/>El Café de las Seis, is a seven-piece group that loves to create music and tell a story through it. There's been a lot of debate between the band members when it comes to name the genre that predominates in our compositions (<i>we play with elements of funk, soul, jazz and our own influences</i>), but lately we think that shouldn't be limits in what to use to express ourselves and be heard.<br/><p><br/>The last year, we started to record our first full-length album, putting all our effort and love in what we do, and despite the circumstances that imply to live in our country these days, we are really close to fulfill our goal, and hopefully, with your help, we'll make it happen.<br/></p>

<h3>What we need, what you get</h3>
<p><br/>After making some numbers, we estimated a minimal of 1200$, in order to finish all the process of:  <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Studio rental and recording<br/>
</li>
<li>Mixing and Mastering <br/>
</li>
<li>Art work <br/>
</li>
<li>Physical reproduction<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be enough to finish a 10 track album, the result of 2 years of writing, producing and rehearsal.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>For us &amp; for you!!</h3>
<p><br/>This album will not be possible without your help, so<b> every person who makes a contribution will be listed in the credits</b> and, depending on the perk of your choosing, <b>your photo will appear on the album</b> as well!!! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The reason<br/>
</h3>
<br/>With a professional quality album in our hands, we could share with the world what we love doing. <br/><br/>Most of the band members have a professional career that differs from music, but we've found true inspiration since the first time we started making music together, and now we've decided to follow our dream, and make it happen.  <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452977736/bludniv6lisgefym6eb4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Risk &amp; Challenges</h3>
<br/>
<p>Through experience, we have learnt that, the recording process itself usually brings up setbacks, that could delay a little the release date, but we are determined to complete our goal, and take our music as far as possible.<br/></p>
<p>What represents a major risk, for us as an independent band, is that every expense made is coming out of our pockets. If we don't reach our goal, we will have to cut some things out of the budget, and yet deliver a product with the best possible quality, and faithful to our sound.<br/></p>

<h3><b>¿Quiénes Somos?</b></h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>El Café de las Seis, es una banda de siete personas que
disfrutan el hacer música y contar una historia a través de ella. Siempre ha
existido un debate entre los integrantes cuando se trata de definir el género
musical que predomina en nuestras composiciones (nos gusta mezclar elementos
del funk, soul, jazz junto con las influencias de todos), pero al final todos
estamos de acuerdo en que no debe haber ningún límite a la hora de expresarnos
y ser escuchados.</p>
<p>El año, pasado comenzamos a grabar nuestro primer álbum,
poniendo todo nuestro empeño y corazón en lo que hacemos, y a pesar de todas
las dificultades que presenta el país en la actualidad, estamos muy cerca de
completar nuestra meta, y con un poco de suerte y con tu ayuda, podremos
hacerlo realidad.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>En nuestro<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/el-caf-de-las-seis/intuici-n"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: white;color: #ff6d00;""><b> Soundcloud</b></a> encontraras más de nuestra música, también puedes seguirnos por<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/elcafedelasseis/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #3d6bbe;""><b> Instagram </b></a>y <a href=""https://twitter.com/Elcafedelasseis"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #7ce3f2;""><b>Twitter</b></a>!<br/>
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Lo que necesitamos, lo que obtienes</b></h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Luego de varios cálculos, estimamos una cantidad mínima de
1200$ para completar todos los procesos de:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Alquiler del estudio y grabación</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Mezcla y Masterización</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Arte Gráfico</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Reproducción Física</p>
<p>Este monto cubrirá todos los gastos para terminar un álbum
de 10 temas, el resultado de 2 años de escritura, producción y ensayo.</p>
<br/>
<h3><b>Para nosotros y para ti</b></h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Este disco será posible sólo con tu ayuda, así que todas las
personas que contribuyan serán nombradas en los créditos y, dependiendo de la
recompensa que elijas, tu foto también podrá aparecer dentro del disco.

</p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3>
<b>
<h3><b>La razón</b></h3></b><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Con un álbum de calidad profesional en nuestras podríamos
mostrarle al mundo lo que disfrutamos hacer.</p>
<p>La mayoría de los miembros de la banda poseen carreras
profesionales que difieren del ámbito musical, pero hemos encontrado
inspiración y un motivo en nuestra vida desde la primera vez que comenzamos a
hacer música juntos, y hemos decidido seguir nuestro sueño y hacerlo realidad.</p>

</div></div>","Who Are We?

El Café de las Seis, is a seven-piece group that loves to create music and tell a story through it. There's been a lot of debate between the band members when it comes to name the genre that predominates in our compositions (we play with elements of funk, soul, jazz and our own influences), but lately we think that shouldn't be limits in what to use to express ourselves and be heard.The last year, we started to record our first full-length album, putting all our effort and love in what we do, and despite the circumstances that imply to live in our country these days, we are really close to fulfill our goal, and hopefully, with your help, we'll make it happen.

Check our Soundcloud profile for more music and follow us on  Twitter and Instagram!!

The band:Luís (Tenor Sax)Henry (Clarinet, Tenor Sax)Ángel (Drums)Jhensy (Voice, Keys)Elías (Guitar)José (Guitar)Yhousel (Bass)

What we need, what you get
After making some numbers, we estimated a minimal of 1200$, in order to finish all the process of:  

Studio rental and recording

Mixing and Mastering 

Art work 

Physical reproduction


This will be enough to finish a 10 track album, the result of 2 years of writing, producing and rehearsal.


For us & for you!!
This album will not be possible without your help, so every person who makes a contribution will be listed in the credits and, depending on the perk of your choosing, your photo will appear on the album as well!!! 

The reason

With a professional quality album in our hands, we could share with the world what we love doing. Most of the band members have a professional career that differs from music, but we've found true inspiration since the first time we started making music together, and now we've decided to follow our dream, and make it happen.  
Our Rewards












Feel free to check out Jhensy's poetry blog here, 
and her publications on a digital magazine on this link.











Risk & Challenges

Through experience, we have learnt that, the recording process itself usually brings up setbacks, that could delay a little the release date, but we are determined to complete our goal, and take our music as far as possible.
What represents a major risk, for us as an independent band, is that every expense made is coming out of our pockets. If we don't reach our goal, we will have to cut some things out of the budget, and yet deliver a product with the best possible quality, and faithful to our sound.

Share, comment, spread the word!

¿Quiénes Somos?

El Café de las Seis, es una banda de siete personas que
disfrutan el hacer música y contar una historia a través de ella. Siempre ha
existido un debate entre los integrantes cuando se trata de definir el género
musical que predomina en nuestras composiciones (nos gusta mezclar elementos
del funk, soul, jazz junto con las influencias de todos), pero al final todos
estamos de acuerdo en que no debe haber ningún límite a la hora de expresarnos
y ser escuchados.
El año, pasado comenzamos a grabar nuestro primer álbum,
poniendo todo nuestro empeño y corazón en lo que hacemos, y a pesar de todas
las dificultades que presenta el país en la actualidad, estamos muy cerca de
completar nuestra meta, y con un poco de suerte y con tu ayuda, podremos
hacerlo realidad.


En nuestro Soundcloud encontraras más de nuestra música, también puedes seguirnos por Instagram y Twitter!


Lo que necesitamos, lo que obtienes

Luego de varios cálculos, estimamos una cantidad mínima de
1200$ para completar todos los procesos de:
· 
Alquiler del estudio y grabación
· 
Mezcla y Masterización
· 
Arte Gráfico
· 
Reproducción Física
Este monto cubrirá todos los gastos para terminar un álbum
de 10 temas, el resultado de 2 años de escritura, producción y ensayo.

Para nosotros y para ti

Este disco será posible sólo con tu ayuda, así que todas las
personas que contribuyan serán nombradas en los créditos y, dependiendo de la
recompensa que elijas, tu foto también podrá aparecer dentro del disco.






La razón

Con un álbum de calidad profesional en nuestras podríamos
mostrarle al mundo lo que disfrutamos hacer.
La mayoría de los miembros de la banda poseen carreras
profesionales que difieren del ámbito musical, pero hemos encontrado
inspiración y un motivo en nuestra vida desde la primera vez que comenzamos a
hacer música juntos, y hemos decidido seguir nuestro sueño y hacerlo realidad.

<h3>Hi,</h3>
<p>I'm so glad you are here. I have been working tirelessly for the past four years on this music and I'm so excited to share it with you. </p>
<p>""Book of Hours"" began as a five movement piece based on the history and text of the Latin Mass Ordinary. Originally entitled ""Mass for Modern Ensemble,"" it premiered at Meany Hall in Seattle, WA in 2014 with a nine piece chamber ensemble of two trumpets, tenor and alto saxophone, bass clarinet, violin, drums, and guitar. </p>

<p>A year later, it went through a transition to accommodate the instruments of a new trio featuring guitar, rhodes, and drums. ""Miserere Nobis"" was performed extensively as a trio, featuring more improvisation and an emphasis on mixing genres of Jazz, Rock, and Contemporary Classical music. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528922074/esrbrdyzd2i9ozy2p8rz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This music, yet again, went through another phase to include bass. This would be the final instrumentation of the project, though the music would soon be extended by the inclusion of three new pieces entitled ""Book of Hours,"" originally a solo guitar piece, reorchestrated for quartet. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For this record I've decided to self release, without the help or support of a label. This gives me total artistic control over the look, feel, and sound of the record, and where it will travel to, live and in record stores.</p>
<p>But it comes at a heavier cost. </p>
<p>We are attempting to raise $3,500 to complete this record. What your generous contribution goes toward is album design, manufacturing CDs, publicity and representation from top notch artist management, and an East/West Coast tour with the band in support of the record. </p>
<p>In exchange for your help, we are offering some fun and exciting perks, including physical and digital copies of the record, physical and digital copies of my previous two studio records, credits printed on the album, songs and compositions dedicated and recorded for you, and other neat stuff. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is my first time crowdfunding in support of my music. I have been very fortunate to have been able to release my last two records with the support of labels and benefactors, but because this album means so much to me, I've decided to try and release it on my own and see it through to the very end. </p>
<p>With your help, you are not only supporting me but the dozens of other artists related to this project, who continue to play, design, record, compose, and write about music. You are contributing to the beautiful eco-system of the arts. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are no guarantees in art. Musicians like myself continue to do what we do because we feel compelled to bring beauty into the world, even if it is to the detriment of our own financial and mental well-being. We put everything on the line to put notes on a page. In spite of the Risks &amp; Challenges we face, we continue to empty ourselves into the music, in hopes that we can share it with you and the world. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We appreciate any way in which you can help; sharing this with a friend, letting them know that there's new and exciting music heading there way, a bed to sleep in or a hot meal while we're on road, or a simple note of encouragement.</p>
<p>Keep in touch! And thanks for listening. </p>

<h3>Scott Garred Self-Titled LP</h3>
<p>I've just finished a new album and it's time to get it in your hands and on to your turn tables. Please help me send it off to the record pressing plant. Consider this a pre-sale.</p>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>While I do feel that every album I make is worth sharing, I don't necessarily feel that every album I make is worthy of the best possible format, which in my opinion is the LP. This one is worthy for many reasons.</p>
<p>This album features sounds I've used before but never quite like this. Every sound has a purpose. A guitar or ukulele may provide the basic structure but what makes each song come to life is left to the piano, drums, bass, distorted bass, melodica, vintage Casio keyboards, and vocal harmonies.</p>
<p>Collaborating with me on this album is <a href=""https://www.corpsofthelilymusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kelly Atkins</a>. She's quite a fixture in the Bay Area music scene (perhaps you know <a href=""https://www.corpsofthelilymusic.com/kitka"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kitka</a> or <a href=""https://20minuteloop.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">20 Minute Loop</a>?) She can make her voice sound like buzzing insects swarming around your head. Perhaps you like the theremin or the singing saw? She does it all folks.</p>
<p>My hope is that these songs will inspire you to think deeply about some of the world's issues. Walk in the shoes of a mass shooter. Shake hands with artificial intelligence. Think about climate change the same way you think about your own mother with dementia. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's needed</h3>
<p>Through this campaign I'm hoping to raise money to manufacture the LPs and mail them to supporters. I am not asking for any financial assistance in producing the music. That part is done.</p>
<p>The reality is this album will never be in a local store. This is our shot people. Let's do it.</p>
<p><strong>Goal: </strong></p>
<p>1. 250 LPs manufactured with beautiful artwork including full color printing, high quality sounds, and a protective poly bag.</p>
<p><strong>Approximate cost: $2000</strong></p>
<p>2. Limited run of 50 CDs. </p>
<p><strong>Approximate cost: $120</strong>                                                                                                                           </p>
<p>3. Shipping and handling costs so that each item can be shipped safely and efficiently to your door.                                                                                                                                                             </p>
<p><strong>Approximate cost: $280</strong></p>
<p>4. Each contribution big or small comes with a digital download of the album plus all the outtakes and alternate versions during the making of this project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share this campaign with your friends. Even if you can't help financially, it makes a big difference just to spread the word. And if you have pledged, please encourage someone you know to do the same. </p>
<h3>If we don't make it</h3>
<p>If we don't reach the goal then we don't make the physical products. That's all. No major crisis. It means you'll have to wait and catch it on Spotify or Apple Music or wherever you listen these days. And you'll get your money back.</p>

Hello Friends,
Thank you for visiting our site and for considering helping us toward our goal of releasing our new album on vinyl.

Who We Are
We are pianist Jed Wilson and drummer Tony Falco, old friends and collaborators who first met when were studying jazz at New England Conservatory. At NEC, we recognized a strong affinity but lost touch in the years after graduation as we traveled different geographical and musical roads. Jed played in jazz and singer-songwriter settings, most notably with acclaimed vocalist Heather Masse. Tony honed his skills as an improviser, including with avant-garde legend Tisziji Muñoz.
More recently, we found ourselves each living in the wilds of New England. We got in contact and began recording together. The resumption of our collaboration first resulted in the 2015 trio release Traces, with bassist Aryeh Kobrinsky. In 2019 we decided to continue our exploration of the creative possibilities of free improvisation by paring things down to the duo format.
This Album
Recorded in one day at Acadia Recording Company in Portland, Maine, this album was totally improvised. We entered each new piece without plans or preconceptions. To our pleasant surprise, all kinds of unique structures and shapes emerged, moments both poignant and playful, tempestuous and tender. Listening back, we were so enamored with what spontaneously occurred in the open space of improvisation that we want to share the totality of that day's work with you all. We decided to call it Illumine in order to reflect the experience of a flash of light or inspiration—that uncanny experience in which the terrain of the known is briefly transcended and something unprecedented emerges. 
Why Vinyl?
It's undeniable: vinyl is experiencing a renaissance, and for good reason. Like most vinyl enthusiasts, we cherish the medium for its warmth and fullness of sound. Additionally, in our digital age, vinyl's nostalgic physicality is pleasing. Who doesn't love placing the disc on the turntable, hearing the needle meet the record's surface, and reveling in that famous ""crackle""? And then there is the joy of holding the album as you listen, experiencing the cover art as an extension of the music. We are believers in the magic of vinyl, and feel that this recording was meant to be experienced in this special way.
Digital
We're not Luddites, though. We certainly understand the appeal of digital. And for that reason, this album will be available for download or streaming in high-quality digital. Your SupportIn order for us to present Illumine in the vinyl format, we'll need your support. For those who can help by pre-ordering your own vinyl double-LP, we are most grateful.

melodies, compositions, and musical techniques that express content from
various states of awareness,</p>

Our fans are generous and persistent, and we are constantly inspired by their encouragement. With them, we want to expand the circle of those who believe that jazz can improve the quality of life.

<p>Hola, soy Carreyó, cantautor panameño residiendo en México. Llevo años componiéndome en canciones y buscando nuevos oídos que entiendan el mensaje detrás de los acordes de mi guitarra. Canto porque sé que la música es medicina para mi alma y para quienes se dedican escucharla.  Llevo dos discos grabados de manera independiente, estoy trabajando en el tercero y primer documental. siendo un artista que autofinancia sus proyectos hoy no no cuento con los fondos suficientes para terminarlo como quisiera y creo que se merece este mensaje.    </p>
<p><strong>¿De qué trata la campaña Carreyó y tú por su disco?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>La campaña consistirá de 40 días de acciones llevadas a cabo en la calle y por redes sociales para  lograr recolectar lo necesario para hacer realidad este nuevo disco con canciones que invitan a reflexionar de nuestra vida, y los sueños que nos esperan detrás del otro lado del miedo. También contendrá un documental mostrando el proceso creativo detrás de como se llevó a cabo esta idea.</li>
<li>El proyecto audiovisual cuenta con canciones secuenciales narrando el camino de<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfl9eTAuI3I"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> ""Jaime</a>"". Un chico que de pequeño sufre de bullying y como de grande podría tener una repercusión en la sociedad. Luego entiende que el miedo es parte de él mismo con <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU0rMNl_rxY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""No te tengo, Miedo</a>"" y se atreve a decirle a una chica que le encanta: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCvD4Z6CCiE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Eres un paisaje""</a>. Luego se da cuenta que el amor va mucho más allá de lo físico, sino de quien somos por dentro y le compone <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdGiZBUWl70"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Tus Defectos Perfectos""</a> que invita a amarnos como somos, a pesar que una relación tenga sus inviernos emocionales con <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axN-plup8UI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Ardes""</a>. Solo van seis canciones reveladas de las catorce que contendrá el disco. Checa los videos haciendo click en la imagen o en los links. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfl9eTAuI3I&amp;index=2&amp;list=PL1rM5P3-4gTRZ4ipOlU6rwOe_vEPHt4oF"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525138202/ysoai2fqerkkrngwpd2n.jpg"" src=""""/></a>

<p>Me emociona ofrecer recompensas exclusivas por sumarte a mi viaje. Desde el una canción personalizada, clases de música, conciertos caseros, hasta artículos que podría usar cualquiera. Hay muchas opciones para que te sumes al mensaje que hay detrás de este proyecto. Con este disco espero inspirar a buscar sueños con todo y sus miedos retándolos, mi intención es que las canciones sean motor de valentía, aceptación y transformación de la oscuridad a su propia luz.</p>

<li><u>Por cada concierto casero obtenido, se donará una presentación en una escuela a nombre de quien aporte.</u></li>

<p> </p>
<h3>El impacto</h3>
<p>Pienso en el reflejo que tiene el mensaje de este disco, en quienes han atravesado un pasado complicado, situación amorosa inconclusa ó el miedo a buscar los sueños. Este proyecto sé que dejará una conciencia de empatía y auto-aceptación a quienes le llegue.</p>
<p>Hace tiempo me di cuenta que mi misión con la música es llevar un mensaje entre canciones que conecten a un mundo más honesto y consciente de nosotros.</p>

<p>My name is René G. Boscio; I've been making music for almost 20 years, with a focus on film/TV since my late teens. I first came to Los Angeles in the fall of 2013, and began working at Cow On the Wall Studio, alongside renowned composer Blake Neely. After spending 3 years full of wonderful experiences, including the opportunity to work on over 100 episodes of television series such as <strong><i>Blindspot</i></strong> (NBC), <strong><i>Riverdale</i></strong> (The CW), <strong><i>The Flash</i></strong> (The CW), and <strong><i>Arrow</i> </strong>(The CW), among others, the time came for me to embark on my own journey.</p>
<p>Since branching out on my own, I've composed scores for dozens of short films, documentaries, mini-series, and other independent productions.

Boscio; I've been making music for almost 20 years, with a focus on film/TV since my late teens. I first came to Los Angeles in the fall of 2013, and began working at Cow On the Wall Studio, alongside renowned composer Blake Neely. After spending 3 years full of wonderful experiences, including the opportunity to work on over 100 episodes of television series such as Blindspot (NBC), Riverdale (The CW), The Flash (The CW), and Arrow (The CW), among others, the time came for me to embark on my own journey.
Since branching out on my own, I've composed scores for dozens of short films, documentaries, mini-series, and other independent productions. My music has also been licensed for use in television advertisements for films like Wonder Woman, as well as branded content for companies such as Chevrolet, Arm & Hammer, Mercury Insurance, and more.
On the path to pursuing my dreams of writing music for major motion pictures, I recently accomplished what I consider to be a fairly significant step: scoring my first independent feature film. In hopes of maximizing, and further immortalizing that milestone, I've decided to self-release a soundtrack album to go with the film, and this is where you come in.

<p>We are a young<strong> prog rock</strong> band from Manchester, England. </p>
<p>We've been operating now for around a year and a half, and boy has it been a <i>blast</i>. Numerous shows, Numerous band members, and hundreds of <strong>new song ideas</strong>.</p>
<p>In November 2016, we released our very first (crowdfunded) EP into the world, entitled <strong>""I""</strong>. We set ourselves a goal of raising <u>£500</u> for four studio days, and we smashed that target.

<p>We love <strong>""I"" </strong>like our own child, but we simply did not have the time or resources to do that record justice.</p>
<p>With<strong> Noir</strong>, we want to give ourselves slightly more breathing room. Instead of <u>£500,</u> we're asking for <u>£1000</u> in total.

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Music is the source of continued growth and depth in every area of my life. I am excited to create this album as my contribution to the world of art and a token of my love for the musical community. The vision to write and record my original music is paramount on my artistic path and I am thrilled to include you in the actualization of this dream.</p>
<p>The jazz-pop group Sarca is made up of my dearest friends who are also some of the most talented professional musicians in Portland’s music scene. With community-based financial support, we can do what we do best: communicate and create.</p>
<p>When you give to support this project, you are not only creating this album, but you also are reinforcing the musical backbone of this beautiful city. Often on startup projects, musicians, technicians, videographers and sound engineers donate hours of time. With your help, I am determined to pay my collaborators, some of Portland’s hardest workers and greatest talent, the rate they deserve. We can join together to support musicians, technicians, photographers, and artists here in Portland for they are truly the heartbeat of the culture we know and love.</p>
<p>If this album is meant to be, then I am determined to pay my musicians, technicians, photographers and artists here in PDX the rate they deserve. </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Budget = $17,500</p>
<p>I have decided to budget the production of the album this way because I know that cutting corners to save money often falls on the shoulders of talented, hardworking people who made it all possible in the first place. Every recording, photo and video made for this crowd funder has been donated by artists out of the kindness of their hearts and the passion they have for what they do. While I am exceedingly grateful for their generosity, this trend is not a sustainable way for anyone  to continue to do what they love. I will not go through with the production of the album if the importance of their work cannot be reflected in the wage they receive from working with me.</p>
<p>Every dollar that is raised for this project is going to the musicians, engineers and artists living in Portland who have already contributed so much to the powerful medium of music and art in this city. </p>
<p>Here are the forces on board with the Sarca project, and heres how much it will cost to hire them.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The majority of funds raised will be used to hire the professionals involved in pre-production, rehearsal and recording. As you give, you raise the standard for musicians in Portland. Music that changes lives takes time, dedication and talent. With your help, music is made, but more importantly, musicians (artists, videographers, technicians) make ends meet.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Recording and sharing original music is a vulnerable journey. Seeking financial support for that endeavor feels even riskier. I hope that others will join with me in supporting the heart and vision behind this Sarca album. I know there’s a risk that I won’t reach my goal and my dream for creating this album and infusing income and vitality into the Portland music scene may not be realized. But I’m willing to take any risk and I hope you will join with me.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute anything monetarily, I would be so grateful for your help with spreading the word and making some noise about this debut album. Sharing on social media and letting your friends and family know would be so greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>It takes an army to make something like this happen, and I'm incredibly grateful for your support!</p>

<h3>Faith &amp; Music</h3>
<p>I wrote the music in REVIVAL over the past two years to counter messages of intolerance and fear with a call for love and justice. </p>
<p>Raised Catholic in San Antonio, TX, I began playing guitar in my church choir when I was ten years old. I loved the music. It was uplifting and I felt deeply grounded in the themes of faith and hope. Since childhood, I have also understood social justice action as an expression of faith, following my parents to nuclear disarmament demonstrations in the 80's and protests against the first Gulf War in the 90's. And the role music played in these efforts left an impression.</p>
<p>My personal journey led me to Judaism and my spiritual home is a progressive synagogue in NYC, where my wife Julia and I have been members for many years. What has stayed with me, and what continues to deepen, is my understanding of sacred music as a source for replenishment and revitalization.</p>
<p>The work of repairing the world is hard, despairing even, but music can offer resilience and hope. Music can speak to the struggles of our times and remind us that we can still create a world that honors the earth, welcomes the stranger, and celebrates the divine in each of us. This is what REVIVAL seeks to do.</p>

<h3>About REVIVAL</h3>
<p>REVIVAL is spiritual folk-rock music that speaks to moral issues of our day. It features original story-driven songs performed by a small ensemble of singers and instrumentalists. Rooted largely in Hebrew biblical texts, the music expresses themes of justice and healing, and envisions a world grounded in love, compassion, and dignity for everyone. Song topics include, among others: welcoming immigrants, women's/LGBTQ empowerment, earth justice, celebrating the divine in each person, and repairing the world together. </p>
<p>We first shared REVIVAL a month after the November 2016 election at WOW Cafe Theater in NYC's East Village. Since that initial three-night run we have performed the music in progressive spiritual spaces around NYC, including the 14th Street Y, Intersections International, and Congregation Beit Simchat Torah. Now we want to bring the music right to your headphones!</p>

</div></div>","Faith & Music
I wrote the music in REVIVAL over the past two years to counter messages of intolerance and fear with a call for love and justice. 
Raised Catholic in San Antonio, TX, I began playing guitar in my church choir when I was ten years old. I loved the music. It was uplifting and I felt deeply grounded in the themes of faith and hope. Since childhood, I have also understood social justice action as an expression of faith, following my parents to nuclear disarmament demonstrations in the 80's and protests against the first Gulf War in the 90's. And the role music played in these efforts left an impression.
My personal journey led me to Judaism and my spiritual home is a progressive synagogue in NYC, where my wife Julia and I have been members for many years. What has stayed with me, and what continues to deepen, is my understanding of sacred music as a source for replenishment and revitalization.

<h2>About Us and Our Project</h2>
<p>We  met in 2013 and quickly realized we were kindred musical souls, inspired by American acoustic and country music but also passionate about the greats of the singer-songwriter genre.  After playing as a duo (Dakota Joe) for three years, we decided we needed a change of pace, changed the name of our band to The Lean and The Plenty, and formed a backing band.  We just so happened to get some of the best musicians in the Bloomington area, with Eric Fritz on drums, Ian Ottinger on upright bass, Devin Brown on mandolin, and Andrew Van Nieuwenhze on electric guitar.  This will be our first full-length record together.  It features five Joe Bolinger songs and five Dakota Curtis songs, with one epic duet.   And we need your help to get it off the ground.  The recording process was done homemade style, with a lot of blood, sweat, and tears in the basement of our drummer Eric's garage.  We've done the hard part of writing and recording the music: now we need to get it mixed, mastered, and manufactured.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need about $800 dollar to mix, master, and manufacture the record.  Our approximate budget is:</p>
<p>Mixing and mastering help:  $300.00</p>
<p>Pictures and design help:  $200</p>
<p>Physical Production of the record: $300  </p>
<h3>Pre-orders and Other Rewards</h3>
<p>We are offering you the opportunity to pre-order the record.  That means you pay for it now, which will help us raise the money we need to get it made.  When we have the physical copies in hand, we will get it to you.  You will have already paid for it, so no need for any additional payments.  Our goal is to have the record in hand by Christmas of this year (2017).  </p>
<p>We are also offering other rewards for people who wish to contribute a larger amount, including personalized thank you's on our album art, audio shoutouts on the record, and even personalized concerts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While there are always risks in making music, there is virtually no chance that we won't make this record.  We are 100% committed to making it, come hell or high water.  The main risks here are whether there will be complications in the editing and mixing and mastering processes that might arise from having done the recording by ourselves and not with a studio.  While this was absolutely necessary for us (we could never have afforded the 100+ man hours put into the recording process if we had been paying for studio time), it does mean there could be mistakes that could cause delays.  So, the biggest risk is that your receipt of the record could be delayed beyond the current goal of Christmas 2017.  I believe the risk of this is fairly low, but it is a possibility. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not able to contribute financially right now, we would greatly appreciate your spreading the word about our work, coming out to shows, and most importantly, listening!  We put our hearts and souls into our music in the hopes that it will mean something to you.  That can't happen if nobody listens.  So the most important thing to us is for you to simply do us the honor of lending your ear.  </p>

<h3>Meg Lindsay's Debut EP</h3>
<p>First and foremost, I want to thank you for taking the time to explore my campaign a little further--to learn a little about me, my life-journey, and why I'm doing what I'm doing.</p>
<h3><strong>The Who:</strong></h3>
<p>I'm Meg Lindsay--a singer-songwriter from the small town of Norwalk, Ohio and I currently reside in New Orleans, LA. My musical journey began so many years ago and surprisingly, not specifically with music. My mom used to read to me when I was little. I remember, she would point to each word as she read it aloud. I remember feeling a connection to the words; a budding interest in the way they come together to paint pictures, stories. My favorites were alway the books that could tell these stories, but with rhythm and rhyme. Each word a puzzle piece, the author carefully and intentionally put together, even if just to create a simple children’s book, I recognized the beauty of the craft and I began to fall in love with it. At age 7, my mom enrolled me in piano lessons and slowly, overtime, these two things began to merge. Somewhere around junior-high, I discovered the real magic of songwriting--and once I felt the spark, I couldn't help but fall in love. My passion for music eventually led me to move to Nashville, TN, where I was able to hone and perfect my singing and songwriting craft at Belmont University while experiencing it all first-hand in Music City, itself.</p>
<h3>The What:</h3>
<p>I'm looking to release this debut EP in early 2018. I've put the entirety of my life-work into these songs and I believe that this is absolutely my best yet.</p>
<p>With your financial support, I will have the opportunity to record at Sound Stage Studios in Nashville, TN. Sound Stage is one of Nashville’s most prestigious and historic recording facilities in the city and home to over 500 #1 hits from names such as Johnny Cash, George Strait, and Alan Jackson. It’s an absolute dream and honor to have the opportunity to record in a studio that has been a platform for so many monumental artists in the music industry. But again, I can’t do this without you.</p>
<p>I value your support and I welcome and appreciate any help you can give as I embark upon this this exciting yet humbling endeavor. I need to raise $3100 for this project, and with your help I believe I can do it.</p>
<h3>The Why:</h3>
<p>My journey to where I am today is brimming with both struggle and triumph. A picture of hills and valleys, unexpected trails, and sometimes dead ends. My story is one of both losing to and overcoming fear. The up and down roller-coaster of self-doubt has left me tired, nauseous, and somedays, paralyzed. But I'm still here. I keep getting up.</p>
<p>I've spent a significant part of my life weaving my roots around music. Some of the years, I've pushed my roots deep into the soil soaking up everything I can get. Others, I've spent trying to cutting them off, even letting them rot.  But like the rings of a tree trunk music is ingrained within me. I can't run from it, because it always finds a way to resurface.</p>
<p>So, I'm making and recording this EP because I want to put myself out there. I want you guys to see what I can really do. Heck, I want to see what I can really do. It's time I start traveling in the direction of my fear, not away from it. And this, is a step in that very direction.</p>

<h3>We're Making an Album called Coyote Gunfight</h3>
<p>Coyote Gunfight is a post-apocalyptic, spaghetti western rock opera told across 14 tracks and 2 acts. It is our ode to concept albums, rock &amp; roll, cowboys, heavy metal, the American myth, and the progressive music we grew up on. It is very silly and awesome and we can't wait for you to hear it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Dynamite Thunderpunch formed in late 2012 in a house built on a precarious hill with no air conditioning and constant basement flooding. One EP and four years later, we're finally ready to release the love child of our combined talents and vision.<br/><br/>If you've never heard us before, our first EP is available at dynamitethunderpunch.bandcamp.com. We play fast, loud, high energy rock &amp; roll, and could probably stand to be a bit less pretentious.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to lighten the load on our shoulders (or pockets?) through allowing you to pre-order this album! Recording a full length album professionally is expensive. We've been extremely fortunate to have so many people already willing to help us complete this project. However, we are paying for this album entirely out of pocket, and we need your support to make this project as big and bad as possible!</p>
<p>We want to be entirely transparent about where your money is going &amp; what costs it's helping us recoup. Our album budget currently looks like:</p>
<p>Recording and Mixing with Audio Bridge Studios - $4000</p>
<p>Mastering with JR Mastering - $350 </p>
<p>Album Art - $100</p>
<p>100 physical CDs with full color insert - $180</p>
<p>GRAND TOTAL : $4630</p>
<p>This isn't including merch and any other promotional work we would like to delve into. Right now we're just paying for the bare basics of an album release, and we would love to be able to afford extended t-shirt runs, the capacity to tour more, and possibly even a vinyl release down the line, to name just a few. However, none of that can happen without your support!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>$5 will get you a full digital copy of our album! That's 14 songs spanning over an hour of music that will surely rustle your jimmies in all the right ways!</p>
<p>$10 will get you a physical and digital copy of our album for those who like to have something to hold in their hand at the end of the day!</p>
<p>$15 will get you a digital copy of our album and one of our existing style T-shirts! (Small and Medium sizes only; while supplies last) </p>
<p>$25 will get you our $10 tier plus our limited edition Coyote Gunfight Album shirt. </p>
<p>If you feel inclined to donate over $200 for some reason, we will write you a custom song! That may be an acoustic duet, it may be a drum solo, it may be a secret song we've been sitting on since 2012, or even something we figure out from your input, but no matter what, it will be all yours.<br/><br/>In addition: We'll be unloading some older merch we have! Any backer will get some random assortment of merchandise we have sitting around as a bonus!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contributing to our campaign is the most direct way to show you care and support our goals. That means more to us than any dollar amount could ever mean. </p>
<p>Coyote Gunfight is already recorded. Its going to be released August 4th. BUT, we're young professionals just starting our careers, and economically speaking, making a record isn't the easiest thing to do alone. We will forever appreciate every single contribution that assists in helping this dream happen.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>As stated, the album has already been recorded and is in the process of being mixed. Regardless of how this campaign performs, there is nothing that can stop our backers from receiving their copies on August 4th.<br/><br/>We can assure you that to our ears, this is the best product we could have made given our circumstances. Throughout the recording process, we were consistently blown away with how great everything sounds, and as a band, are so excited to share this work with you.</p>

<h3>About Zack Varner</h3>
<p>     Growing up just outside of Atlanta, Georgia, I developed an insatiable curiosity for music in my youth.  At thirteen I discovered the saxophone, and music has been a compelling force in my life ever since.  As a career musician for well over a decade now, I have spent my life studying, composing, performing and teaching in a broad spectrum of musical environments.  Five years ago I arrived in Austin, where I completed my Doctorate of Musical Arts at the University of Texas.  I also discovered a music scene that would come to shape my creative development profoundly.  </p>
<h3><strong>What This Project Means</strong></h3>
<p>     This album represents not only a personal milestone for me, but an opportunity to connect with people in a positive and creative way.  <i>Blues in the Nude </i>reflects the culmination of many years of hard work and artistic growth.  I believe strongly in the material I have written, and the artistry and skills of the musicians involved.  It means a great deal for me to have an album under my own name to show for this work.  Completing this project will not only help me achieve a tremendous career goal, it will allow me to share something I have  created with people.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>     Thankfully, the creative work involved with producing a full length album from scratch is mostly complete.  However as many know, there is a great deal more to the process of releasing a record.  The <i>Blues in the Nude</i> band recently finished recording at <a href=""http://greenhavenstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Greenhaven Studio</a>, one of Austin's finest recording facilities, and thanks to many hours of hard work and top notch engineering work, we have an excellent foundation to build upon.  </p>
<p><u><strong>Here's where we need your support:</strong></u></p>
<p>     The remaining part of the production process includes: mixing and mastering, CD duplication, online distribution, album artwork and design, publicity, indiegogo platform/credit card fees and shipping.  The image below displays how the funds contributed to this project will be used.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508353375/siwxxflkmjt7f7ihmygj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Making the CD and Getting It Out There</strong></p>
<p><b>     </b>Meeting our full project goal of <strong>$</strong><strong>6,000</strong> will provide us with everything we need to bring the record to life.  As well as covering the basic costs for producing the physical CD and online digital download, reaching this amount will allow us to put funds towards online press, radio, album reviews, regional tours and concerts!    </p>
<p><strong>Funding Details</strong></p>
<p><strong>     </strong>The music industry has evolved drastically in the last few decades, and new challenges have emerged in the process of creating and sharing material, especially for independent artists lacking major label support.  Crowdfunding provides an accessible and effective solution to this challenge, and a means by which artists can produce and spread their music.  With indiegogo's ""flexible funding""  platform, every dollar contributed will go directly towards the realization of this project.  In other words, we keep everything we raise.  </p>
<p><strong>How to Contribute:</strong>  If you simply want to support the process, just click ""back it"" (located at the top right) and enter your contribution amount.  If you'd like to claim a ""perk,"" just scroll down the right hand side of the page and select your favorite option.      </p>
<h3><strong>Perks!</strong></h3>
<p>     An exciting variety of perks are available for this project.  The CD is packaged as a high quality 4 panel digipak featuring original artwork by Ilia De La Rosa.  Signed CD's, sheet music and play-alongs, private music lessons (live or skype), your name in the album credits, a song written for you, even a private house concert and an executive producer credit are all available.  <strong>I will personally be handling the fulfillment of all items and perks, so feel free to contact me directly with any questions, comments or concerns:  zackvarnermusic@gmail.com</strong></p>
<p>     The life of a musician comes with its own set of challenges, but when a project like this comes together, it makes it all worthwhile.  We appreciate your support more than you know.  <u>Please feel free to share this project with anyone you like</u>.  Let's reaffirm that crowdfunding is an effective way to create, fund, and share music!   </p>

     Growing up just outside of Atlanta, Georgia, I developed an insatiable curiosity for music in my youth.  At thirteen I discovered the saxophone, and music has been a compelling force in my life ever since.  As a career musician for well over a decade now, I have spent my life studying, composing, performing and teaching in a broad spectrum of musical environments.  Five years ago I arrived in Austin, where I completed my Doctorate of Musical Arts at the University of Texas.  I also discovered a music scene that would come to shape my creative development profoundly.  
What This Project Means
     This album represents not only a personal milestone for me, but an opportunity to connect with people in a positive and creative way.  Blues in the Nude reflects the culmination of many years of hard work and artistic growth.  I believe strongly in the material I have written, and the artistry and skills of the musicians involved.  It means a great deal for me to have an album under my own name to show for this work.  Completing this project will not only help me achieve a tremendous career goal, it will allow me to share something I have  created with people.
What We Need & What You Get
     Thankfully, the creative work involved with producing a full length album from scratch is mostly complete.  However as many know, there is a great deal more to the process of releasing a record.  The Blues in the Nude band recently finished recording at Greenhaven Studio, one of Austin's finest recording facilities, and thanks to many hours of hard work and top notch engineering work, we have an excellent foundation to build upon.  
Here's where we need your support:
     The remaining part of the production process includes: mixing and mastering, CD duplication, online distribution, album artwork and design, publicity, indiegogo platform/credit card fees and shipping.  The image below displays how the funds contributed to this project will be used.

Making the CD and Getting It Out There
     Meeting our full project goal of $6,000 will provide us with everything we need to bring the record to life.  As well as covering the basic costs for producing the physical CD and online digital download, reaching this amount will allow us to put funds towards online press, radio, album reviews, regional tours and concerts!    
Funding Details
     The music industry has evolved drastically in the last few decades, and new challenges have emerged in the process of creating and sharing material, especially for independent artists lacking major label support.  Crowdfunding provides an accessible and effective solution to this challenge, and a means by which artists can produce and spread their music.  With indiegogo's ""flexible funding""  platform, every dollar contributed will go directly towards the realization of this project.  In other words, we keep everything we raise.  
How to Contribute:  If you simply want to support the process, just click ""back it"" (located at the top right) and enter your contribution amount.  If you'd like to claim a ""perk,"" just scroll down the right hand side of the page and select your favorite option.      
Perks!
     An exciting variety of perks are available for this project.  The CD is packaged as a high quality 4 panel digipak featuring original artwork by Ilia De La Rosa.  Signed CD's, sheet music and play-alongs, private music lessons (live or skype), your name in the album credits, a song written for you, even a private house concert and an executive producer credit are all available.  I will personally be handling the fulfillment of all items and perks, so feel free to contact me directly with any questions, comments or concerns:  zackvarnermusic@gmail.com
     The life of a musician comes with its own set of challenges, but when a project like this comes together, it makes it all worthwhile.  We appreciate your support more than you know.  Please feel free to share this project with anyone you like.  Let's reaffirm that crowdfunding is an effective way to create, fund, and share music!

Please take a look at our SoundCloud page to get a better idea of the work we've done so far! https://soundcloud.com/heather-gilligan-1/tracks



What We Need & What You Get
 
We have completed the recording of two full song cycles,
a total of seven tracks, with another cycle scheduled for recording in July 2016.  We were thrilled when Albany Records showed interest in our project and offered to release our CD on its classical music label! With three song cycles still to
record, we are seeking funds to pay our nine guest artists a competitive wage, to cover the engineering and editing fees for our engineer Christopher Swist, and to ensure a place on the Albany Records 2017 release list.  
Recording sessions will take place according
to this timeline:
August 2016 - record “Winged Reflections,” 3 songs
for soprano, saxophone, and piano (texts by Lisa DeSiro and Mimi White); December 2016 - record “Battlegrounds,” 4 songs for
soprano and string quartet (texts by E. Ethelbert Miller); January 2017 - record 3 new songs for soprano and
percussion (texts by Lisa DeSiro).
We have a plethora of perks and incentives for donating to our campaign, including a copy of our completed CD, a chance to sponsor an individual artist, and an opportunity to underwrite a new piece of music that will be personally dedicated to YOU!

<h3>What's it all about?</h3>
<p><br/>In my adult life, I've always had to prioritise playing other people's music and other projects to pay the rent. Then, a tour that I was booked to play on was cancelled and I realised that I needed to think about the way my career was developing. With my new-found time and determination to make the best out of the situation, I realised that <strong>now</strong> was the time to prioritise my own music and finally make the album!</p>
<p>I'm going to need <strong>at least £6k</strong> to make this project happen as intended. Those who know me will know that I've never been a rich person (who'd be a musician?), and this amount of money is simply out of my personal reach. I don't see this project as a business venture, it's an artistic one - I'm fully expecting to make a loss - but I'm bursting to make a <strong>great album</strong>. <br/><br/>The vast majority of the budget will be spent on <strong>musician fees</strong>, <strong>studio time</strong> and <strong>mixing and mastering</strong>(around £4.5k). I believe in <strong>supporting</strong> the music community and paying a fair price for the talents and facilities of others while keeping the project tangible. I will be using top musicians<strong> </strong>on this project, and as such, will be requiring excellent <strong>post-production and engineering </strong>to do their exceptional performances justice.<br/><br/>The remaining £1.5k will be going on the production of CDs, Artwork, and the fulfilment of <strong>perks</strong>!<br/><br/>I've enlisted the help of epic rhythm section heroes <strong>Dave Marks </strong>(bass) and <strong>Darby Todd </strong>(drums) to get the ball rolling, but<strong> expect more announcements about guests and contributors as the campaign progresses</strong>...<br/><br/>I will take absolutely none of the money as a wage or to buy equipment. <strong>Every penny </strong>will be spent on making the album <strong>as good as it can possibly be.</strong><br/><br/>I would <i>LOVE </i>to absolutely smash the target amount!<strong> </strong>If this is achieved, it'll give me the opportunity to create extra perks and potentially create a budget to create <strong>more and better </strong>content.

<h3>The Story So Far</h3>
<p>Since first picking up the guitar, I've been writing music, this eventually led to me earning a PhD in classical composition and creating educational content for guitarists around the world with jamtrackcentral.com. But these two sides of what I do, playing and writing, have remained largely separate, until now...<br/><br/>I'm not messing around with this project: I want to produce the album to a professional standard while featuring world-class musicians. Quite simply, that <strong>costs</strong> a lot of money. But I've never shied away from a big, <strong>ambitious</strong> project.</p>My album will be an expression of my interests in fusion, prog-rock and contemporary classical music (check out the music underneath the campaign video... that kind of thing!). It certainly won't be your typical instrumental guitar album. A record label probably wouldn't go near this kind of thing in an ever more risk-averse industry, but that's why I'm turning straight to <strong>the people</strong> who are interested in what I do for support. <p><br/><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496154072/kl9cajcrdrsh1nllub4x.jpg"" src=""""/></strong><br/> </p>
