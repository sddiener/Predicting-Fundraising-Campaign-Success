Everyday people, reality show stars and celebrities. These videos will be used as pitch videos for Networks and will also be put on Youtube. Film crews and editors are not cheap. The money will be used to compensate the film crew, equipment and to travel to different locations. I have made contact with a well known reality show star that has agreed to be in one of the episodes. With his connections, this can really go somewhere but I have to put in a lot of work myself. I am willing to put in the work but it also takes money. Every little bit helps.

<h3>How We Began</h3>
<p>​     As many early career artists know, to support your passion you have to get one or many ""survival jobs."" I was no exception. I took the the first job that would have me, handing out coupons for a large restaurant chain in Times Square in the dead of winter. That didn't last long. But it was the catalyst for a slew of other absurd side gigs.<br/>​     Folks in the industry always say, ""write the work you want."" I have always aspired to be on a comedy series like ""The Office"" or ""Parks &amp; Recreation."" I began to think about how my side jobs would be portrayed in the same comedic layout. The material came pouring out.<br/>​     I needed someone with expertise in writing to help harness and guide my experiences and ideas. I asked Alex Riad to jump on board as my writing partner and co-creator, and he graciously agreed.  He has a way of capturing the voice of our generation with truth and humor. I knew that together we could make this story one worth hearing.<br/><br/>     Our hope is that the people who see this series are brought belly laughs from the situations young artists face daily in New York City. All the while, inspiring young people to see that these sometimes daunting life experiences are equally important in forming who you become as an artist. We hope to continue to bring you content for a long time because we believe that every side job is a story worth hearing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise the final $12,000 of our $30,000 goal. We are very lucky to have some amazing, supportive investors on our side so we could hire a top notch creative team and crew (Producer- Danny Hoffman, Director- Jessica O'Hara-Baker, DP- Jarrod Hurwitz.) The rest of the money being raised will go to props, location, paying our actors, insurance, craft services,equipment rental, and post-production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Viewers Are Leaving TV for the web</h3>
<p>By 2015, according to the National Association of Broadcasters, 3.8 million households cancelled their cable subscriptions in favor of buying a-la-carte streaming services. In 2017, cable lost another 1.7 million. Also, only one third of Millennials even pay for TV and they’re the biggest generation. People didn’t stop watching TV, but they switched to the web to get it. We are hoping to have our series join the many success stories sprung from original online content.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After years of working in the industry and in the wake of the #TimesUp Movement, I realized the true lack of women's voices in the film world -- especially in creative roles. If we want this to change, we have to start from square one by creating these roles for ourselves. That's exactly what I'm trying to do with ""Inconvenienced"" - shoot a female-driven comedy that is completely created and supported by women (&amp; Elie). The future starts here, so help support women by supporting causes that promote their power! As a script, ""Inconvenienced"" has been recognized by both the Screencraft Fellowship Competition and The Austin Film Festival. Once this short is completed, it will be used as a Proof of Concept to shoot the FULL PILOT with a full women crew!</p>
<h3>Who Am I Giving My Money To?</h3>
<p>I guess I have to talk about myself now. I will do so in the third person to trick myself into feeling important.</p>
<p><strong>Katie Benvenuto </strong>attended the London Film School and achieved a Masters in Screenwriting like a boss. She then moved to Hollywood, Land of Dreams, and landed a dream job -- PRODUCTION ASSISTANT! Since then, she has worked her way up through the industry on such films as ""Kong: Skull Island"", ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" and ""Rampage"". But, don't let these big monkey movies fool you -- ""Inconvenienced"" is much closer to the TV shows Katie has worked on -- ""Barry"" coming to HBO this March, and Alan Yang's new Amazon show to premiere later this year. Katie has worked the grind, and seen first hand the lack of diversity and gender equality in this industry. Her work as both a writer and crew member has inspired her to evoke change from the ground up. Help me (whoops, I mean HER) on this journey!</p>
<p><u>Producers</u>:</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Espinetti </strong>is an emerging Hispanic female in the entertainment industry whose goal has always been to work with and produce content that can be universally loved and enjoyed. Her career in production ranges from working on award winning short films, feature films, commercials and television. Her mission is to bring the stories of those who are voiceless to a broader audience. </p>
<p><strong>Elie Choufany </strong>is, yes, a man who got his B.A. in Film Studies in Beirut, Lebanon in 2012, after which he received his M.A. in Screenwriting from the London Film School in 2014 in London, U.K. He worked in various departments in Film and Television as a writer, director, cinematographer and editor.  Elie wrote the sci-fi TV series 'Arabs in Space' and he recently finished writing an animated feature film 'Norm of the North 2' for Lionsgate that just went into production.</p>
<p><u>Associate Producer</u>: <strong>Nancy Duff </strong>is a recipient of the ScreenCraft Fellowship and a past participant in The Writers Lab, created by IRIS and NYWIFT, supported by Meryl Streep and Oprah Winfrey. In 2017, the WeForShe Organization selected Nancy’s pilot script for their annual WriteHer List, which highlights female-written television scripts. The same script also appeared on the Emerging Writers Top 100 List. Nancy has been a finalist for the WIF/Black List Episodic Lab in both 2016 and 2017. Nancy’s latest feature screenplay is a 2017 Page Awards Finalist, a Top 3 Final Draft Big Break Finalist (Action/Adventure Category), and winner of the screenwriting award at the Napa Valley Film Festival. Writing across multiple genres, Nancy has placed in the top ten percent of the Universal Pictures Writers Program (2016 Semi-Finalist), Austin Film Festival and Nicholl Fellowship screenwriting contests.</p>
<p><u>Director of Photography</u>: <strong>Carrie Scott</strong> is a Los Angeles based Cinematographer and Photographer, originally from Bozeman, Montana. Upon graduating with a dual degree in Film Production and Film Critical Studies from the University of Colorado - Boulder, Carrie took her camera and backpacked her way around the world. From working on films with award winning actors and crew, to fashion shoots with top designers, Carrie brings an adventurous spirit and keen eye to every endeavor.</p>
<p><u>Production Designer</u>: <strong>Adrienne Garcia </strong>is a photographer turned Set Dresser known for her work on ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" ""Baskets,"" ""The Conjuring 2,"" and ""Barry"". </p>
<p><u>Art Director</u>: <strong>Laura Benvenuto</strong> is Katie's sister and being forced to do this against her will. She received her Masters in Textile Design from Philadelphia University and currently works as a designer for Title Nine Athletic Wear. So, she's legit.</p>
<p><u>Hair and Makeup</u>: <strong>Gabrielle Rossbach </strong>has over 6 years of experience in the industry, and has worked with Golden Globe winners and various celebrities. She works with all types of makeup, from beauty to body painting to special effects.  <a href=""http://www.gabriellemua.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.gabriellemua.com</a></p>
<p><u>Costume Designer</u>: <strong>Cindy Bagby </strong>is a New York based Costumer known for her work on ""Boardwalk Empire"", ""Orange is the New Black"", ""The Americans"", ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"", ""Inside Amy Schumer"", ""Mr. Robot"", ""Jessica Jones"", ""Daredevil"", ""Billions"", and ""The Night Of"".</p>
<p><u>Editor</u>: <strong>Jacqueline Basse </strong>is a New York based Editor known for her work on ""She's Gotta Have It,"" ""Rev Runs Around the World,"" ""Killing Richard Glossip,"" ""Impractical Jokers"" and the soon to be released ""Dreamland"". She is also a great friend to all those Irish and dispossesed. </p>
<p><u>Publicist</u>: <strong>Lindsey Brooke</strong>  In 2007, Lindsey watched the entire Sex &amp; The City series—yes, the fuchsia velvet set—cover to cover in one month. Legend has it that she may have invented the concept of binge-watching. This set contained two behind-the-scenes discs with cast and crew. A fire was lit inside her when she realized that it took a village to make the magic of film come alive, and she could be one of those villagers. So, that’s what she does now. Lindsey has worked in TV production, indie film distribution, and has a B.A. in Literature from Ramapo College of New Jersey.</p>

<h3>Who We Are And What We're Doing</h3>
<p>Hey! We're two twin brothers from Wilmington, Delaware who just quit our accounting jobs to pursue our acting careers. This has been a dream of ours for a long time, and we're excited to get started.</p>
<p>This is our first project; a fictional web series based on our escapades in New York as struggling actors. The first season revolves around the twin brothers' attempts to land parts in the new Judd Apatow movie. Maintaining their New York lifestyles is difficult; hiding the truth about their careers from their family is nearly impossible. When the brothers land the call back of their dreams, they are forced to consider how much they are willing to compromise to make it big.</p>
<p>We are very excited about our script, and we are currently in the process of rounding out our production team. We have created this Indiegogo to raise money to finance the project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul><li>We have a goal to raise 5000 dollars for our series, or a budget of 1000 dollars per episode. This will cover the costs of the production crew, cast, props, locations, equipment, and marketing.</li></ul>

<p><strong>GREETINGS!</strong></p>
<p>We are the Pillmarsh Production Group. For the past 10 years we have established as a working production group made up of Producers, Writers, Directors and Key Crew.

Countless short films, music videos and more!</p>
<p>Iron City: 1978 is a concept that we have thought about for years. We knew back then that we would have to further enhance our skill set as a production crew in order to make this idea possible for screen/television with the highest quality available for viewing pleasure. Hence the numerous feature films under our belt and short film tests for many ideas. This type of concept is uncommon in the Australian Film and Television scene but not for the rest of the world. We love creating interesting stories and characters that can not only relate to, but entertain. So if you are a fan of Sci-Fi, Action, Thriller with a mix between Anime, 70's and 80's cinema then you will definitely enjoy what we have to offer. </p>
<p>By reaching $20,000aud we will be able to enhance the quality of the production through the costumes, props, locations thus providing a better product that what we can imagine. The Producers for Iron City (Stewart Marshall, Julian Pillirone, Josh Mason) have already contributed a few thousand dollars to get the basics done for a minimum completion quality which includes the first six episodes to be filmed over the next five months. The last six episodes (episodes 7-12) will be focused upon in early 2019 as the story line involves a larger budget due to what is planned in locations, props, costumes and cast. </p>

<p>Iron City; once called Melbourne - but that was before the war. Since the Axis Powers won WW2 Australia has fallen under Nazi rule. It is now 1978.

Mysterious, eccentric characters lurk around every corner. The Twin Valkyries; a pair of female assassins wreaking havoc on the Nazi Generals and guards. The Tinkerer; a man with no past, who has a finger in every pie he can get at, pulling strings behind the scenes - but whose side is he on? The Architect; the woman manufacturing the capacity for the Italians and Japanese to regain their status. The Last Russian; a tech giant who lives as a phantom, being the only man with the secrets to the most powerful weapon in the city.

Concept

GREETINGS!
We are the Pillmarsh Production Group. For the past 10 years we have established as a working production group made up of Producers, Writers, Directors and Key Crew. We have recently just finished our latest feature film called ""Blue Grace"" (Drama Created by Dan Andrusiak) which is currently our 3rd feature film produced by our group. Countless short films, music videos and more!
Iron City: 1978 is a concept that we have thought about for years. We knew back then that we would have to further enhance our skill set as a production crew in order to make this idea possible for screen/television with the highest quality available for viewing pleasure. Hence the numerous feature films under our belt and short film tests for many ideas. This type of concept is uncommon in the Australian Film and Television scene but not for the rest of the world. We love creating interesting stories and characters that can not only relate to, but entertain. So if you are a fan of Sci-Fi, Action, Thriller with a mix between Anime, 70's and 80's cinema then you will definitely enjoy what we have to offer. 
By reaching $20,000aud we will be able to enhance the quality of the production through the costumes, props, locations thus providing a better product that what we can imagine. The Producers for Iron City (Stewart Marshall, Julian Pillirone, Josh Mason) have already contributed a few thousand dollars to get the basics done for a minimum completion quality which includes the first six episodes to be filmed over the next five months. The last six episodes (episodes 7-12) will be focused upon in early 2019 as the story line involves a larger budget due to what is planned in locations, props, costumes and cast. 


Story:
Iron City; once called Melbourne - but that was before the war. Since the Axis Powers won WW2 Australia has fallen under Nazi rule. It is now 1978. The Nazi Party has annexed their former allies and Melbourne is a city ruled by despots in which Australians, Italians and the Japanese alike are oppressed. But a revolt is brewing. Mysterious, eccentric characters lurk around every corner. The Twin Valkyries; a pair of female assassins wreaking havoc on the Nazi Generals and guards.

All of these characters, along with the Rebellion forming in the slums make up the complex workings of a city transformed by one war and now on the brink of another.

<h3>A NOTE FROM THE WRITER</h3>
<p>Hi IndieGoGo!</p>
<p>Atlas is a mini web series about a woman, Ari, who sells her soul to the Devil, to save her little sister, Maddy's, life. He gives her seven years to live. Our story starts on Ari's last week of existence, when the Devil shows up to collect. Atlas is about a woman not conquering her Seven Devils, but perhaps changing <i>one </i>of them. In a world currently dominated by glorified revenge or 'take down' campaigns, I wanted to offer something that suggests that maybe the those struggles in our lives don't require such negativity to resolve. In this case, a little more conversation, a little more action, y'all.</p>
<p>Stylistically, Atlas has a really unique perspective to offer: we play with a multitude of formats and styles in the show- flash forwards and broken fourth walls are some to name a few! The best way I could pitch this show to you, is to tell you it's a bit of Shameless meets American Gods, meets a bit of Jessica Jones. If that what you're into- you're in the right place.</p>
<h3>ABOUT THE TEAM</h3>
<p>Alex Borlo acts as Creator, Executive Producer and Director. She is a DC native, recently graduated from the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, which is currently ranked as the number one acting school in the UK.</p>
<p>Amanda 'AJ' Bovea serves as Director of Photography. She is coming in from Miami to shoot with us and she holds both a Bachelors and Master's degree in Film from Full Sail University.</p>
<p>We have ladies from around the world filling roles in Casting, Story, Crew, Production and more!</p>
<h3>THE STUFF</h3>
<div>We're a relatively low budget production, but we still need your help to:</div>
<ul>
<li>Rent venues and standing sets for filming to get you some incredible production quality</li>
<li>Rent equipment and buy props and costumes to provide you with one hell of a visual feast</li>
<li>To make sure our Crew and Cast are provided for and safe during long set days</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>IN SHORT</h3>
<p>Above anything else, we are asking you to stay engaged with us, stay tuned, stay watching. This project has something to say and we would love for you to hear it.</p>

<h3>Howdy Internet!</h3>
<p>My name is Eli Tell. 5 years ago, I was working <strong>50 hours a week as a cashier</strong> at a grocery store. I had no time to be creative as I was constantly <strong>exhausted and uninspired</strong>. It was then that I had the idea for Jamdromeda, a universe where <strong>jamming is illegal</strong> and a few subversive space-voyagers journey through the cosmos uplifting the galaxy through song.</p>
<p>In the past 5 years, we've fully developed this idea. We have a cast of characters like <strong>Sir Friskydigits, Professor Beaucoup-Beats, The Countess Bassie, </strong>and many more! We have a pitch bible, several scripts, and the above animatic. In short, <strong>we're ready to take this idea to the next level! </strong></p>
<p>In recent years, we've seen a world increasingly bereft of genuine creativity. In <strong>a world of reboots</strong> and a <strong>continued effort to cut funding to the arts</strong>, we must <strong>fight back</strong> with subversive, beguiling, and inclusive content that shows real creativity and a love for life itself. That's what Jamdromeda represents to me:</p>
<p><b>A chance to be real and inspiring. </b></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We want to make a fully animated pilot!</p>
<ul>
<li>We need (at least) $9500 to make this thing the right way. We'll need a team of animators, storyboard artists, character designers and a little something to pay our actors. </li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will still use every penny we get to get the best animation we can afford. It's basically a situation where, no matter what, we're going to get this thing animated. The quality of the animation will just vary.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's obviously challenges with regards to the pandemic and getting all the people together to work but through Zoom, at home recording, and this funny little invention called email, we feel we can complete this project just as quickly as we could have in normal times.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Director and writer, Mike Swift of Street Gold Pictures has written numerous web series, shorts, and full features. His most recent web series was presented at ITV Fest, Brooklyn Web Fest, NYC Web Fest, and more. Producer Tori Kotsen has produced many successful short films and is currently a double major in media studies and economics at the University of Virginia where she is focusing on film studies. We came together through a television producing course at NYU and have been working on this project for the past eight months.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our budget is roughly $40,000, but we need room for insurance and accidents in case we hit any road bumps. Actors and a lot of crew will have deferred payment so all your money would be going directly into production. You'd be supporting the equipment, location rent fees, production design, costumes, and select crew, as well as things in post like editing and sound mixing. Every bit will help move the project along and lead it to be that much more successful. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have an opportunity to create a really entertaining show that we have faith will be very successful in the future. You are helping two young aspiring filmmakers create something amazing and boost their careers to the next level.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only problems we really foresee right now is effectively raising money to secure a venue. Wedding venues aren't cheap and deposits often have to be put down early so the faster we can secure funds, the faster we can secure a location and begin filming.</p>

Prepare to go where no fan production has gone before!
Fan films are dreams come true, wish-fulfillment fantasies realized through the miracle of video production.  But what if it all happened for REAL? What if you were suddenly on board the USS Enterprise and Captain Kirk and his crew needed YOUR help?  Would you know what to do? After all, you're the ultimate Trekkie, right? But this isn't just a show anymore, and those Klingons are really shooting at you!
Meet Peter Warren, a ""get-a-life"" Star Trek fanatic who wakes up on the bridge of the USS Enterprise in his Captain Kirk pajamas...only to discover the ship is empty, the crew displaced in time, and an unstoppable foe from the future has a plan that is futile to resist.  Can a Trekkie in his pajamas possibly save the Federation all by himself?
Cross the threshold between reality and fantasy as the two become one in the upcoming fan film ""To Have Boldly Gone.""  With your generous donations, you can help turn this fantasy into a wonderful reality for fans everywhere to watch and enjoy!
 ""to sleep, perchance to dream – ay, there's the rub, for in this sleep of death what dreams may come""

We couldn't make this film without your help and you can take home a small piece of it.
This fan film is more than a home movie, we have the best set is the world, we have experienced workers and our cast have been in numerous films.

Check out the perks, there should be something for everyone:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! We are students at the University of Georgia pursuing degrees in a  range of subjects. However, we are all very passionate about filmmaking and telling stories. Our project, PSA, is a 3 part mini-series that follows the interwoven stories of 3 different women and their struggles rooted in their own individual and unique identities. It is a 3 episode social drama with each episode lasting about 10 minutes. Produced by Madie Young and Eli Quintanilla and written by Lucia Vereen, PSA is a unique and fantastic opportunity not only to gain hands on experience, but to make something meaningful. We can't wait to get started and see the series come to light. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Basically, what we need from you, is help funding our film to help with equipment costs, transportation, locations, and food on set. We want to raise as much money as we can so that we are able to use the best equipment and make PSA as great as we know can be. As college students, we don't really have the money to pay for any of this strictly on our own. That is why we are asking for some help. Anything you can donate would be greatly appreciated! In return, you will receive a letter of gratitude and all the bragging rights to say you helped make a mini-series!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will not only help fund PSA, but will ensure that we as students are able to learn from the newest equipment, use the perfect location, and feed our hunger on set! Your donations will allow for us to be creative, independent, and make the series the best it will be. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We understand that there are certain risks of making a series like ours and we will always make sure we are responsible with the funds. If for some reason, something goes wrong, we will make sure to keep you informed and ensure that your money is returned or a solution is found immediately. We understand that the costs of equipment can be very high and especially when we plan on using the equipment for an extended period of time. We also understand that many other cost factors that we cannot fully anticipate will come into play as well. We will budget and make sure that the money will go to the right places. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If  you are unable to contribute, we understand and hope that you stay updated and still watch the series when it comes out! In the meantime, if you know anyone that might be interested please send this their way. And like our page on social media! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Kris Scott was born in Irvine, Scotland. From the age of sixteen, he became very fond of the way films were made and wanted to know more. He followed numerous behind the scenes videos from different films, making his imagination go wild with what he could do. He studied media at College, including Writing, Film Making, Journalism and Photography, building upon his growing love for the arts. He also studied drama, which led to a massive confidence boost, giving him the courage to attend auditions and pursue a career in acting.  As a result, he was awarded the roles of a student in 'Waterloo Road' and Tenant Shaun in 'Outlander'.</p>
<p>“Detachment is important to me as we began the journey during the COVID-19 situation that engulfed the planet. Making this brought a number of creatives together from around the world. When it came to a close, it was suggested that we make another series, continuing the story but expanding on the world we created in the first series. This allows us to expand on the character arcs, grow the cast and add more locations. </p>
<p>With your help we can build this world, grow the characters and create a series we can all be proud of.”  <br/> </p>

<h3><u>NOBODY - The Story</u></h3>
<p>Their daughter raped and murdered... His guilt growing... Her sanity slipping... Therapist Tom Campbell and his media mogul wife Annabelle are primed to unravel. </p>
<p>NOBODY is a story of a man and woman united by faith and commitment, bound by total devotion and true love, yet tortured by a deep sorrow. Devout Catholics, Tom and Annabelle passionately observe the tenets of their faith, but in the throws of anguish are also plagued with the questions we all have at one time or another: Where is God? Where is the justice in life? Why doesn’t someone DO something? </p>
<p>Annabelle is a sharp, poised political writer and commentator, but with the one-year anniversary of Grace’s murder approaching, she is unable to cope, and becomes a woman on the edge of losing her mind. Tom is a therapist for sexual abuse victims, and constantly reminded of his daughter’s suffering, he becomes a man on the edge of losing control, ultimately taking justice into his own hands.</p>
<p>NOBODY is a world of dualities; a man of faith forced to reckon with the darkest aspects of his soul, and a woman of great renown brought to her knees in a search for emotional comfort. It’s a universal story about trust and secrets, faith and doubt, and forgiveness and punishment. It explores the idea that when grief, guilt, and fury collide... perhaps justice is the best therapy. </p>
<h3><u>Why contribute to our project?</u></h3>
<p>The themes of NOBODY (sexual abuse, human brokenness, justice) hit very close to home for many people. We have become increasingly aware of the DEVASTATING impact of sexual abuse and just how common it is.  In fact, if you're reading this, statistics suggest that you have been the victim of sexual abuse or know someone who has. It is pan-demograpic: every race, religion, socio-economic background, nationality and creed is affected by sexual abuse.  </p>
<p>NOBODY takes the issue head-on in a way everyone can relate to. Through the story of Tom and Annabelle, we examine the often life-long impact of the sexual abuse pandemic, as well as the universal experiences of grief and loss, a yearning for justice, and the prospect of healing and hope.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>The Impact of your donation</u></h3>
<p>As artists our work is done largely in quiet rooms, alone and with no guarantee of income. We have second jobs that allow us to keep the lights on and food in the refrigerator. Your donation means we get to take the meetings potential investors are already requesting without having to sell our furniture or cars. $20 may seem like nothing to you, but when 500 of you send an Andrew Jackson our way, it means we get to pursue investors, begin location scouting, and start pre-production with room to breathe. We thank you in advance for the trust you show in us and the encouragement that we get with every donation. We're thrilled about this project and believe it has an incredible future. Thank you for being a part of it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u></h3>
<p>Making art a lucrative business is hard. Really hard. But we believe this issue is so ubiquitous, the story so compelling, and the themes so universal, that once people get the vision of NOBODY they'll jump right in. The journey brings a myriad of challenges: beginning with raising the full $550,000 production budget, then garnering attention from web platform, studio, and network decision-makers, as well as selling NOBODY to a market that's already saturated with more content than anyone can possibly watch, AND making our money back for our investors.</p>
<p>These are all very real challenges that we are uniquely equipped to address. Our team is in the top of their respective fields, with actors currently on top-rated network shows, producers with years of experience, and a consultant currently at the helm of a major network show. Our marketing team is led by a veteran of the ad business with over 30 years of experience with firms such as Publicis, Leo Burnett and Weiden and Kennedy. Our legal team is made up of numerous attorneys with all manner of legal expertise from three different states.</p>
<p>We are thrilled and honored to have their trust and passion working with us. There are no guarantees in our business, but with our team we feel well-equipped to address any issue that will certainly come our way.</p>

<h3><u>Can't donate? No sweat! Help us spread the word!</u></h3>
<p>We know money is tight for a lot of people right now. Trust us, we totally get it. So here are ways you can support the NOBODY team and mission without going into debt:</p>
<p>Copy, paste, and SHARE THIS CAMPAIGN! We believe the story of NOBODY will speak to millions and millions of people. All they need to do is hear about us. The more you share your passion about NOBODY, the more opportunity people have to see what a ground-breaking, honest, and universal story this is. </p>
</div></div>","NOBODY - The Story
Their daughter raped and murdered... His guilt growing... Her sanity slipping... Therapist Tom Campbell and his media mogul wife Annabelle are primed to unravel. 
NOBODY is a story of a man and woman united by faith and commitment, bound by total devotion and true love, yet tortured by a deep sorrow. Devout Catholics, Tom and Annabelle passionately observe the tenets of their faith, but in the throws of anguish are also plagued with the questions we all have at one time or another: Where is God? Where is the justice in life? Why doesn’t someone DO something? 
Annabelle is a sharp, poised political writer and commentator, but with the one-year anniversary of Grace’s murder approaching, she is unable to cope, and becomes a woman on the edge of losing her mind. Tom is a therapist for sexual abuse victims, and constantly reminded of his daughter’s suffering, he becomes a man on the edge of losing control, ultimately taking justice into his own hands.
NOBODY is a world of dualities; a man of faith forced to reckon with the darkest aspects of his soul, and a woman of great renown brought to her knees in a search for emotional comfort. It’s a universal story about trust and secrets, faith and doubt, and forgiveness and punishment. It explores the idea that when grief, guilt, and fury collide... perhaps justice is the best therapy. 
Why contribute to our project?
The themes of NOBODY (sexual abuse, human brokenness, justice) hit very close to home for many people. We have become increasingly aware of the DEVASTATING impact of sexual abuse and just how common it is.  In fact, if you're reading this, statistics suggest that you have been the victim of sexual abuse or know someone who has. It is pan-demograpic: every race, religion, socio-economic background, nationality and creed is affected by sexual abuse.  
NOBODY takes the issue head-on in a way everyone can relate to. Through the story of Tom and Annabelle, we examine the often life-long impact of the sexual abuse pandemic, as well as the universal experiences of grief and loss, a yearning for justice, and the prospect of healing and hope.

The Impact of your donation
As artists our work is done largely in quiet rooms, alone and with no guarantee of income. We have second jobs that allow us to keep the lights on and food in the refrigerator. Your donation means we get to take the meetings potential investors are already requesting without having to sell our furniture or cars. $20 may seem like nothing to you, but when 500 of you send an Andrew Jackson our way, it means we get to pursue investors, begin location scouting, and start pre-production with room to breathe. We thank you in advance for the trust you show in us and the encouragement that we get with every donation. We're thrilled about this project and believe it has an incredible future. Thank you for being a part of it!

Risks & Challenges
Making art a lucrative business is hard. Really hard. But we believe this issue is so ubiquitous, the story so compelling, and the themes so universal, that once people get the vision of NOBODY they'll jump right in. The journey brings a myriad of challenges: beginning with raising the full $550,000 production budget, then garnering attention from web platform, studio, and network decision-makers, as well as selling NOBODY to a market that's already saturated with more content than anyone can possibly watch, AND making our money back for our investors.
These are all very real challenges that we are uniquely equipped to address. Our team is in the top of their respective fields, with actors currently on top-rated network shows, producers with years of experience, and a consultant currently at the helm of a major network show.

Our legal team is made up of numerous attorneys with all manner of legal expertise from three different states.

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>The unprofessional and disgruntled staff clash with each other at THE OWL'S NEST, a trendy and overpriced gastropub in this mockumentary comedy series. It's like The Office, but in a restaurant. <br/><br/>That's what we call an elevator pitch in the biz. Isn't it weird that showbiz and food service both use the phrase “in the biz?” We bet that gets incredibly confusing in L.A. We wouldn't know. We've never been. We produce all of our own content... Which is a perfectly clever segue into the question:<br/><br/><strong>Why do you guys want our money? couldn't you produce the show in a more traditional way? Pitch it to a network?</strong><br/><br/>Maybe we could. But what would we compromise in doing that? Do you want to see a show that understands the world of food service, that<i> really</i> gets it, be put in the hands of TV executives who have never worked for tips? You know those are the same guys in suits who come in and call you ""Sweetheart"" and snap their fingers for service, right?<br/><br/><strong>This ain't their project, it's ours. And it's yours.</strong><br/><br/>We want to cut out the middle man and have a series produced by the audience.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>""Once upon a time, there lived a girl. She looked around and saw the world, not as it was, but as she knew it could be. She said, 'Happy endings aren't a given, I'll build the world I want to live in. And if I catch a break or two, there'll be no stopping me!'""</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Presto! Fairy Tales (The Web Series! The Musical!) is a celebration of the magic of storytelling. About two years ago, a small team of us (without a lick of filmmaking experience between us) sat down to dream about producing a new web series that would embrace all the whimsy, wonder, and wackiness of fairy tales in a way that was both reverent and playful at once, using punk, rock, and other modern music styles to create something that would lift up, entertain, and inspire dreamers and lovers of fairy tales all over. Gradually the team began to grow (and we added a few people who knew a thing or two about web series production) and after many months of planning, production, and post-production/editing we had created something that we're all quite proud of. Throughout the process we utilized over forty local artists, giving many a chance to stretch their wings and try something new as well as promote themselves to a world-wide audience for the first time. Our following is currently small, but we continue to grow and our dream is to one day reach thousands of households with our off-beat, zany brand of story peddling. We hope that our stories--many of the obscure, oft-overlooked entries from fairy tale collectors and folklorists around the world--not only delight but also encourage others to dream for themselves, to ""grind away"" through whatever stands in their way between the ""now"" and the ""happily ever after."" As Jaclyn Appleblossom (Official Fairy Godmother) once put it, ""You know what I get out of most fairy tales? It's  not about the happy ending. It's about what you gotta go through to get it.""</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We started this project with no real budget and, through the generosity of family and friends, were able to raise about $2,000 to fund season one--every penny of which went into production expenses (props, costumes, hospitality, legal fees, literature, set construction). And, truth be told, we would have preferred a bit more money to spend on these things, but we made do without it. We were also EXTREMELY fortunate to be able to borrow all the video and audio recording equipment that we used for season one. That, unfortunately, does not appear to be a possibility for season two, which means we will need to rent or buy new equipment if we would like our production quality to be roughly the same as what we had a year ago. That's quite an added expense. We have priced equipment rentals at about $1200--and again, that would just be bringing us to the same level as what we've used before. Ideally, we'd like to be able to improve our production quality, which would obviously mean more money, but for now our fundraising target would be to reach the same level of production we hit in 2017. </p>
<p>Our current goal, therefore, is $3,400. If we hit that number, our equipment and production needs are taken are of (as well as our Indiegogo expenses). If we receive less, we will prioritize equipment rental and try to scrape by borrowing as many costume and prop elements as we can (we got good at this last year). Anything over that will go toward improving the quality of our work--better lighting, better costuming, better recording devices, money to invest in merchandising to support our work even further into the future. Everything you invest goes straight into giving you the best possible Presto! Fairy Tales we can create AND helps provide a stable foundation for future seasons.  Truly, we're not asking for a gargantuan sum of money. Though, truth be told, we also wouldn't down a gargantuan sum of money if it was offered :-) </p>
<p>We have put together a few incentives as a thank you for certain tiers of gifts. Our hope has always been that Presto! becomes something that everyone feels a ""part"" of--from those of us who met two years ago to dream this crazy dream to every actor and musician who gave their time and talent to every person who clicks ""play"" on YouTube. Presto! is a little like a family, and we want for you all to feel a part, and several of our perks were created with this idea in mind. </p>
<p>Thanks for considering helping us. We hope you'll decide to become a part of our story. </p>

Adventurous Minds LLC is an American film studio that develops and produces animated television programming, featured and short films.​  Our studio started in 2012, but officially became a business in January of 2017.  We worked on an short animation for the Jackson 5 documentary on Joe Jackson. Character design working alongside Pixel Pirate Studio for American hip hop artist ""Desiigner"" in one of his later music videos called ""Zombie Walk"". We also worked on a project called ""Primus 7"", which was a story developed by an NBA player who wanted to create more diverse content in the media of Animation.

WEBSITE HOME PAGE: https://www.adventurousmindsstudio.com/

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Here at Adventurous Minds LLC we're currently developing 4 Animation short stories and we need your help with funds to push these projects through to the finish line. In return for your support, we would love to create an Online Animation Course program that shows you our step-by-step process.

Short Animation 1-2: https://www.adventurousmindsstudio.com/single-post/2018/11/02/2-PART-ANIMATION-SHORT
Short Animation 3: https://www.adventurousmindsstudio.com/single-post/2018/10/30/PROGENY-American-web-television-series 
Short Animation 4: https://www.adventurousmindsstudio.com/single-post/2018/10/30/PLANET-RISE-RPG-ANIMATION-TRAILER

This course will only be to those who support. For those who donate to our higher perks, will be granted with extra features/behind the scenes from either of the four projects once released. There are special things that are provided in each perk other than the Animation course itself. So be sure to read our perks!

 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Responsible for manifesting this course is a couple of studs who are taking this opportunity to meld their creative juices together into something extraordinary... and you're all invited! =D
We need your help in order to bring these projects to fruition. We cannot do this without you, the backers, the Supporters, the real MVP's!
 

The Animation Course program will contain about 4-6 tutorial episodes or even more depending on how much we fund for this campaign. We're calling it series 1 and each episode will run about 25-35 minutes long, documenting our step-by-step process showing you how we create an animation scene!
 This could give back to so many aspiring artists that have nothing but love and passion for this career field and they want to learn more about it. Maybe one day, these very same people will put their own mark on some of the most wonderful films and shows to come.
The animation course will cover how we use the following programs; Photoshop and After Effects.

 
First our focus will cover how we animate using Photoshop. We'll show you our step by step process and then break down our animation process. The break down would cover all the bases such as; storyboarding to recording the reference for the particular animation cut, then move on to key poses and then finally animating the rough.
 

Then we move into After Effects and from there we'll show you how we compose and organize the animation frames. The big focus here will be on timing. We'll show you how we time our animation cuts in order to get the right flow in speed. 

Then out of all of that effort comes this:

NMI:  Our stoic staff has been doubling as crew members:  running sound, lights, editing, post-production, special effects, etc.  Plus, you know Elise...she's a creative workhorse and is the star of maybe a dozen of the episodes.
 
YOU:  Sounds exhausting.  How can I help?
 
NMI:  We need some money to pay for: editors, costumes, lighting crew, sound crew, directors, and stagehands.
 
YOU:  Glad to help!  Anything else?
 
NMI:  As a matter of fact...thanks for asking.  As if producing 92 videos wasn't enough, we're also producing two (count 'em TWO) Mainstage productions at the 2019 Hollywood Fringe Festival:  The Bully Problem, written by Michael Shapiro, winner of NMI's 2018 Search for New Musicals; and we're partnering with Smart Media LLC for the musicalization of Hell's Kitty, based on the hit internet series and now Amazon Prime Video movie.

YOU:  Can I see some of that?
 
NMI:  You can see Hell's Kitty movie on Amazon Prime.  If you want to see the musical,
YOU:  Sounds fantastic.  I want to help you make your goal.  I'll go find the right combination of perk/donation right now!

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Coop Lee, I've been swordfighting for over 10 years, creating and promoting swordfighting videos through my Youtube/Facebook Channel, TUSSLES, for three years, and building a platform and brand that can be utilized by all Modern Sword Sports as an exploratory, promotional tool.</li>
<li>This project is to specifically video document Team USA in all her glory (particularly 5v5 melee combat) while at Battle of the Nations 2017 and give you, the audience, fans, and family, an unprecedented perspective of the event and action.</li>
<li>Contributions to this project are NOT ONLY going towards Battle of the Nations and steel combat videos of our friends and rivals, but will help fund and network future TUSSLES endeavors in other swordfighting styles and organizations, like that of foam-fighting (Belegarth/Dagorhir/Amtgard).</li>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Story</h3>
<p>Our main character, Naeemah, a young black woman who attended predominantly white schools all her life, gets expelled from Yale University during her junior year, and transfers to Howard University in Washington, DC. Shortly after her arrival, she realizes the grass isn't always greener on the other side; because even amongst her own people, she still feels out of place. Naeemah has two roommates, Brittanie and Mufﬁn, who have recently graduated from Howard University, and are both hurdling obstacles during their transition into adulthood. This series shows 3 different women, from 3 vastly different backgrounds, come together in support of one another. 3 Blind Mice illustrates the physical and mental diversity among black millennials; while implementing 90's television nostalgia.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHAT YOU WILL HELP US ACHIEVE </strong></h3>
<p>The money raised from this campaign will be used to film the pilot episode of <i>3 Blind Mice</i>; which will be pitched to various networks and production companies. Independent film making is one of the most important steps to empowering Black people by reflecting our communities' stories in one of the most public spaces. By contributing to the production of <i>3 Blind Mice</i>, you will be an intrigual part in greatly enhancing diverse Black representation in the media. You will help cultivate developing Black film makers and empower us to be our best selves by way of reflection, discussion, and action. By increasing representation of Black people in the media, we will all work to enhance our communities by looking back to where we've been, to inform where we are presently, and how we will grow in the future.</p>

<p>At this moment, there are no television shows that cater specifically to Black millennials. <i>3 Blind Mice</i> is here to fill that need. From the interviews and research we conducted, one major conclusion that can be drawn is: there is without a doubt an audience who feels that they are lacking programming that speaks specifically to their experiences as young Black people coming into their own as adults. Art gives us the ability to reflect a vision of the world. We can then use this reflection to reconcile who we are with who we want to be. By seeing ourselves on television in the way that many other cultures and ethnicities get to see their communities represented, we can learn from where we've been and reach our greatest potential as we grow. As the message of Sankofa suggests to us, we must look to our past to inform our present and future. We look at past representations of Black culture such as,<i> A Different World, </i>to inform our current experiences and use that information and our imaginations to create a new kind of world for ourselves. </p>
<p><i>3 Blind Mice</i> will add to the long legacy of Black TV shows that have shaped our culture and communities while also contributing new voices to the conversation of what Blackness is. </p>

We<br/>filmed them in the backyard, the basement, wherever we could, but they<br/>definitely were not very good.<br/><br/>As the years went on, we began making our own original horror films.

We wanted to make a Part<br/>2 that was even better than the first one to bring the fans of Halloween<br/>(much like ourselves) what they want. Parts 1 and 2 were financed out of<br/>our own pockets and as much as we would love to make a Part 3, production<br/>costs are very expensive and to do it right we need *your help*.<br/><br/>Our goal is to raise enough to cover the basic costs of making a film the<br/>fans want to see.

Wefilmed them in the backyard, the basement, wherever we could, but theydefinitely were not very good.As the years went on, we began making our own original horror films. Fastforwarding to today, we have worked on and produced multiple movies includingdistributed works such as “We are Still Here” and “Book of Evil”. We nowown a production company that has been very successful in Rochester, NewYork.The reason we decided to start crowdfunding for part 3 is because of howwell ""Halloween Inferno"" was received by the fans. We wanted to make a Part2 that was even better than the first one to bring the fans of Halloween(much like ourselves) what they want. Parts 1 and 2 were financed out ofour own pockets and as much as we would love to make a Part 3, productioncosts are very expensive and to do it right we need *your help*.Our goal is to raise enough to cover the basic costs of making a film thefans want to see. It has always been our dream to work on a Halloween film setand we want to make something so good that Hollywood will have no choice butto get us involved in the next one.See ""Halloween Inferno"" (part 1) here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS09GXc4AZo&t=11sSee ""Halloween Inferno"" (part 2) here: https://youtu.be/IRfDyfFRVmo  Why Raise Funding?We are looking to raise $20,000 to fund this 15-20 minute project. The teamcame up with this number after adding up the expenses from the first twoinstallments that were done out of pocket.The films were both filmed on industry standard cinema cameras, lenses andlighting equipment all rented from local production companies. For us tomaintain the quality of the inferno series rentals are a must have.This money will also go to paying and feeding our extensive cast andcrew for their hard work and dedication. Locations will be a big part ofthe budget as we needed to rent multiple locations for several daysfor each film. Your contributions will go a long way in pushing productionforward.Other Ways You Can HelpThe positive feedback from the fans of our first installment of HalloweenInferno is what inspired us to keep going with the story. We are all fansworking on this project and it is such an amazing feeling to see thereaction to what we created. We want to keep going, so if you like what wehave made, feel free to share it with your friends and people you know.Spreading the word is an amazing way to help us out on this project andfuture ones as well. Big ProductionsEnjoy some Behind the Scenes pictures below that will show you the amount of work that goes into productions like Halloween Inferno Parts I & II....",15.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>Welcome to Groovy Tuesdays!</h3>
<p>We're a musical comedy web series that follows three queer women navigating their way through their sexuality and friendships in Los Angeles. <i>Think: A queer gal Flight of the Conchords!</i></p>
<p><strong>The Creators:</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576541515/ibcsqxixpfuvjvubypdy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Hi!  It's <strong>Nicole Ledoux</strong> and <strong>Abbey May</strong>, creators and cowriters of Groovy Tuesdays.  We realized that the roles we were booking in Los Angeles didn't allow us to be our full weird, funny, and queer selves...so why not write nuanced roles for ourselves and other queer actors that we know?</p>
<p>In real life (as in the series) we are roommates, LGBTQ+ community members, and best friends. <strong> We both have a passion for witty bits and goofy songs which clearly comes through in our writing. </strong> This silliness paired with our passion toward shining a spotlight on queer voices has come together to make a wonderfully palatable comedy series about the experience of coming out as bisexual.</p>
<h3>Okay, so... why?</h3>
<p>We've asked many members of our community for feedback on our script and story and what resonated most of all was there was a gap in the LGBTQ+ narrative for lighthearted material. <strong>Coming out is hard, but why not express that through some giggles and jingles? </strong></p>
<p>More importantly, we wanted to share how queerness is boldly and truly independent to each person's life experience. We wanted to create a story where our characters grapple with their lack of understanding on what it means to be queer altogether.</p>
<div>
<h3>Where Your Money Is Going:</h3>
<p><u>The money raised is going towards filming the pilot episode of Groovy Tuesdays. </u> </p>
<p><i>Why just one episode?</i>  The pilot will be used as a ""proof of concept"" to present to streaming services, larger donors, and supporting organizations. Our series is in fact 9 episodes with 10 musical numbers! Big work ahead of us. Our best bet for some serious series-wide funding is to get support for this pilot...because a bigger budget means a better quality episode.  So by helping us film one episode you're helping us film them all!</p>
<p><strong>What We Have:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Black Magic Cinema Camera 6k.</li>
<li>A director and 2 producers.</li>
<li>A fantastic cast!</li>
<li>Fully developed 9 part script with 10 songs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your contribution can count for:</strong></p>
<ul>

</div></div>","Welcome to Groovy Tuesdays!
We're a musical comedy web series that follows three queer women navigating their way through their sexuality and friendships in Los Angeles. Think: A queer gal Flight of the Conchords!
The Creators:

Hi!  It's Nicole Ledoux and Abbey May, creators and cowriters of Groovy Tuesdays.  We realized that the roles we were booking in Los Angeles didn't allow us to be our full weird, funny, and queer selves...so why not write nuanced roles for ourselves and other queer actors that we know?
In real life (as in the series) we are roommates, LGBTQ+ community members, and best friends.  We both have a passion for witty bits and goofy songs which clearly comes through in our writing.  This silliness paired with our passion toward shining a spotlight on queer voices has come together to make a wonderfully palatable comedy series about the experience of coming out as bisexual.
Okay, so... why?
We've asked many members of our community for feedback on our script and story and what resonated most of all was there was a gap in the LGBTQ+ narrative for lighthearted material. Coming out is hard, but why not express that through some giggles and jingles? 
More importantly, we wanted to share how queerness is boldly and truly independent to each person's life experience. We wanted to create a story where our characters grapple with their lack of understanding on what it means to be queer altogether.

Where Your Money Is Going:
The money raised is going towards filming the pilot episode of Groovy Tuesdays.  
Why just one episode?  The pilot will be used as a ""proof of concept"" to present to streaming services, larger donors, and supporting organizations. Our series is in fact 9 episodes with 10 musical numbers! Big work ahead of us. Our best bet for some serious series-wide funding is to get support for this pilot...because a bigger budget means a better quality episode.  So by helping us film one episode you're helping us film them all!
What We Have:

Black Magic Cinema Camera 6k.
A director and 2 producers.
A fantastic cast!
Fully developed 9 part script with 10 songs.

Your contribution can count for:

Estimated minimum of $500.00 in filming permits in Los Angeles.
Estimated $2,000.00 in audio and lighting rentals.
Craft services, i.e. feeding everyone on set! roughly $20 per crew member (per day of shooting) plus-- snacks and water.
$650.00 in camera lenses and accessories.
$1,500.00-$2,000.00 in hiring additional crew members.



What are the Steaks?
You mean, stakes. It's okay, we knew what you meant. We are raising $6,000 to film a pilot with a quality that matches our ambitions.  That being said, we can still make a pilot episode with whatever money we end up raising. The more we raise, the better the content--Let's shoot for the Groovy Tuesdays stars!


Other Ways You Can Help
Low on your cash flow? We totally get it. 

Make a smaller than expected contribution, but ask 5-10 friends to match your contribution!
Share! This! Campaign! The more traction we get, the easier we can ask people outside our community for help.

<h3>Origin Story</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Jason Farrington. Thanks for checking out my campaign. I've been passionate about film and TV ever since I was a little kid. Throughout high school and college I worked in the movie theater business, immersed in the film world and forever fascinated by visual storytelling.</p>
<p>For the last seven years, I worked as the media director for a missions organization and church in Madison, WI. During my time there, I was in charge of all live event production, put together documentaries about our work in Ghana, Africa, produced a music album, and helped create a short film called ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvOktpJurxI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lifted</a>"".</p>
<p>Now a freelance photographer and videographer, I felt the time was right to create a project I've been wanting to make for many years.</p>
<p>Elementary Cooking is inspired by my brother's kindergarten class project from 25 years ago. Each child shared with the teacher their version of the recipe for their favorite meal and then created a cookbook. The results were hilarious. I always thought that this concept would make a great cooking show but never pursued it. Until now.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531283903/zsvw3nnoijm6bs8lbvfu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Recently my family and I found the original cookbook and after reading through it again, I knew I had to make the show. It went on the back burner for a little while, but now it's time to make this dream project come to life.</p>
<p>By supporting this project, you will be making a years-long dream become a reality and you'll be part of a community of people filled with joy and laughter produced by the simplicity and purity of children.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While an entire movie can now be shot on an iPhone these days, I want to step up the production value of Elementary Cooking.</p>

<p>The goal for this campaign is $3,000. The money will be used to get the remaining equipment needed to turn my kitchen into a TV set, pay for all of the food we'll be making, and of course, to send all of you amazing backers the cool perks we have set up.</p>
<p>Speaking of perks, here's a quick list of what's available to you as a backer: Social media shoutout, digital wallpaper, special thanks in the credits, digital copy of the pilot, fridge magnet, coffee mug, DVD of the pilot, T-shirt, and even executive producer credit.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every new undertaking has some level of risk and will undoubtedly run into challenges but I've come too far now to turn back.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Before <strong>FOXES Television</strong> there was <strong>FOXES Magazine</strong>, a magazine dedicated to all things men's fashion and rock n roll.<strong> </strong>The magazine is run by mother and son duo, Tina and Julian de la Celle, and has been successfully running in print for the last three years. This year, the idea sprung up to start some kind of television series showcasing the wide range of talent in the music and fashion worlds. The two main sources of inspiration? The early inception of <strong>MTV</strong>, and the <strong>Jim Jarmusch</strong> film <i><strong>Coffee and Cigarettes</strong></i>.</p>
<p>It's a show that revolves around an iconic duo, for example Mick Jagger and Martin Scorsese, and pairs them up in conversation. The content around that conversation includes: live sets with up and coming and already established bands, spotlights on fashion designers, backstage at fashion weeks and tour diaries with bands.</p>
<p>Attached to the project is <strong>Orian Williams</strong> who produced the BAFTA and CANNES winning film <i><strong>Control</strong></i>, directed by <strong>Anton Corbijn</strong> detailing the life and times of <strong>Joy Division </strong>frontman Ian Curtis. Other noteable credits include <i><strong>The Last Movie Star</strong></i> with <strong>Burt Reynold</strong>s and <strong>England Is Mine</strong>, a portrait of <strong>Morrissey</strong> and his early life in 1970s England. Also attached as a producer and music supervisor is musician <strong>Kevin Haskins</strong> of <strong>Bauhaus</strong>, <strong>Love and Rockets</strong> and <strong>Tones on Tail</strong>.</p>

<h3>Who are We and why should you invest?</h3>
<p> As the Director, and one of the Producers, I want to share why this project means so much to myself and the crew. Most importantly, why it's important to have fans doing fan work, and what it means to see it come to life. For starters, even though I've been directing and producing Independent Films since 2014, my first love was always graphic novels and comic books. Picture a young boy designing characters and drawings at age ten to share with only his parents and close friends. Now jump forward to 2018 when an excited DC Fan (the writer for the series) tells me he's waited three years to give a project about NIGHTWING to life. How could I possibly refuse? </p>
<p>How can you take on such a project though and do it right? With larger studios above making the Cinematic Universes, how does the underdog compete? The answer lands with being a fan. Knowing the characters and developing them in a new way that a familiar lover of the characters can enjoy. Diving further and passionately with the actors to create the living story on screen that we all can enjoy.</p>
<p>With your contribution, we have a shot. The proper sets, the correct costume design, and just as important: the chance to be proud of the work we set forth to make for both new fans and old fans of DC alike.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do we Need? How do we show Thanks?</h3>
<p>Where does the money go, and where does the price lie may be your first question now. Thankfully, we have some answers. We've assembled a strong crew, and cast, which will help considerably:<br/>1. Costume Design: A friend has agreed to, and has already, used his 3D printer to create some amazing design work. The hours and products alone to make this possible has stressed the friend considerably, but they push on. With additional funding, we can make the accurate purchases for both the 3D printing materials needed and costumes. Especially as an action series, the need to have back ups in case of things that break is essential.<br/>2. Transportation: Not limo and jet rentals, but traveling to sets. Shooting in Colorado, to bring the settings of the DC Universe to life will require a lot of travel. The funding provided will assist in:<br/>a) Gas for carpooling cast and crew (some locations over 300 miles apart from each other)<br/>b) Emergency fund for minor repairs if required on vehicles (personal vehicles only)<br/>c)  Lodging far from homes. Although many locations will consist of friends houses as the overnight stay, a cast member affiliated with a hotel chain can get very modest priced accommodations. It may be 5 people to a room, but it helps!<br/>3. Food and Drink: With no plans for 5 Star cuisine, your funding will assist in out of pocket expenses for food and drink. Taking care of cast and crew, some far from home on set, thanks to your donation we will be able to provide home cooked meals and snacks. The donation will help us keep everyone happy, and that alone is a huge thanks from us and them. Happy sets make great shows.</p>
<p>BUT HOW DO WE SHOW THANKS???</p>
<p>No matter the donation size, the first thing you'll see is the free release of the Series on the Public Platform of Youtube. Accessible to everyone, and made with your help, you will never have to pay to see this on screen.</p>

</div></div>","Who are We and why should you invest?
 As the Director, and one of the Producers, I want to share why this project means so much to myself and the crew. Most importantly, why it's important to have fans doing fan work, and what it means to see it come to life. For starters, even though I've been directing and producing Independent Films since 2014, my first love was always graphic novels and comic books. Picture a young boy designing characters and drawings at age ten to share with only his parents and close friends. Now jump forward to 2018 when an excited DC Fan (the writer for the series) tells me he's waited three years to give a project about NIGHTWING to life. How could I possibly refuse? 
How can you take on such a project though and do it right? With larger studios above making the Cinematic Universes, how does the underdog compete? The answer lands with being a fan. Knowing the characters and developing them in a new way that a familiar lover of the characters can enjoy. Diving further and passionately with the actors to create the living story on screen that we all can enjoy.
With your contribution, we have a shot. The proper sets, the correct costume design, and just as important: the chance to be proud of the work we set forth to make for both new fans and old fans of DC alike.

What do we Need? How do we show Thanks?
Where does the money go, and where does the price lie may be your first question now. Thankfully, we have some answers. We've assembled a strong crew, and cast, which will help considerably:1. Costume Design: A friend has agreed to, and has already, used his 3D printer to create some amazing design work. The hours and products alone to make this possible has stressed the friend considerably, but they push on. With additional funding, we can make the accurate purchases for both the 3D printing materials needed and costumes. Especially as an action series, the need to have back ups in case of things that break is essential.2. Transportation: Not limo and jet rentals, but traveling to sets. Shooting in Colorado, to bring the settings of the DC Universe to life will require a lot of travel. The funding provided will assist in:a) Gas for carpooling cast and crew (some locations over 300 miles apart from each other)b) Emergency fund for minor repairs if required on vehicles (personal vehicles only)c)  Lodging far from homes. Although many locations will consist of friends houses as the overnight stay, a cast member affiliated with a hotel chain can get very modest priced accommodations. It may be 5 people to a room, but it helps!3. Food and Drink: With no plans for 5 Star cuisine, your funding will assist in out of pocket expenses for food and drink. Taking care of cast and crew, some far from home on set, thanks to your donation we will be able to provide home cooked meals and snacks. The donation will help us keep everyone happy, and that alone is a huge thanks from us and them. Happy sets make great shows.
BUT HOW DO WE SHOW THANKS???
No matter the donation size, the first thing you'll see is the free release of the Series on the Public Platform of Youtube. Accessible to everyone, and made with your help, you will never have to pay to see this on screen.
Donations of $100 or more will receive a poster signed by the Leading Cast and Director as well as a thank you in the credits of each episode in the series (Seven Episodes planned). We appreciate your help! Posters provided by local businesses in our community.
Donations of $500 or more will receive the above mentioned benefits, as well as a Producer credit on the series in each episode (Seven Episodes planned). A signed official poster, a ""made possible by"" in the credits, and credited as Producer on the show. You deserve it and we thank you!
Donations of $1000 or more ( Wow! Really? Thank You! ) will receive all of the above mentioned perks, as well as the Grand Prize of Perks: First release viewing.

<h3>A Quick Overview</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Emily - and first and foremost, I want to say <i>thank you. </i>Thank you for taking a look at this page and thank you for learning a bit about what I want to accomplish. I'm so excited for what's to come. </p>
<p><strong>In the beginning (a very good place to start). </strong>I first started thinking about <a href=""http://www.wethevotersproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We the Voters</a> almost four years ago, when I was fresh out of college and trying to determine how to use my journalism degree. I'd wanted to be a journalist since I was seven, but was a bit disillusioned on where I saw the field headed. Then, life took a few twists and turns, which leads us to today.  </p>
<p><strong>We the Voters is about real conversations. </strong>In a series of audio, video, and photo interviews, I'll share 2,500 conversations online - sans bias or analysis. Consider it a <a href=""http://www.wethevotersproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">one-stop shop</a> so you can learn more about people all around the country - people who may look, sound, or seem different (or similar!) at first glance. Because I believe that most people are good - and that we're not as different as we might originally think. </p>
<p><strong>Together, we can bring this project into the world. </strong>But -- I will not be able to do it without your help. Every dollar you can spare means another day on the road and another person I can talk to. It means better equipment and more resources, which means even better interviews you can listen to while I'm on the road. </p>

<h3>Thank You for the Support</h3>
<p>I know I said it before, and I'm sure I'll say it a few hundred more times. But I also know that words only go so far, so I'd love to share a little something with you too - a small token of my gratitude for all of your kindness and support. </p>

The incredibly generous support we received has kept us going since then and until recently appeared to have been sufficient to allow us to start putting the new plans, developed with your help, in place.However, the economic impact of the Corona pandemic on first China and now the world has resulted in clients delaying the contracts (and their revenue) we needed to execute these plans.We, therefore, need to ask for your support again and hope that, once again, our community of viewers will rise to the occasion. As it stands, and without this support, we will have to suspend our daily broadcasts from April 1st for an as of yet unknown period of time.This would come at a time when more people, young and old, than ever before are forced to be at home or are admitted to hospitals and would benefit from our broadcasts. ""Research shows that even if they’re artificial, the images, sounds and smells of nature can have positive health effects. Listening to nature sounds over headphones, for instance, has been shown to help people recover faster from stress–which might explain why so many spas employ nature sounds in their treatment rooms."" - The Healing Power of Nature - Time Magazine, July 2016  What We Need & What You GetWe, therefore, need to once again look to you, as our community of viewers, to support us. To keep our daily safaris operating through April we would need to raise approximately $70,000. If we raise more, we can keep them going for longer, but April is our first objective.These are difficult and uncertain times for most everyone, and many of you might not be able to contribute much, or at all. We understand that. You can also help through spreading the word about the campaign. Any contribution, in any form and of any size, can help us in continuing our daily LIVE safaris and is appreciated.For those who can help financially, we've created a number of 'perks' for you to choose from. Please have a look and pick one, or choose to contribute whichever amount you can by choosing 'no perk'. How your support will benefit many othersWildEarth has been on a mission to 'connect people with nature' and over the past 12 years have reached millions of people.  Many of those are simply watching because they enjoy it, but there are also many for whom it provides a brief escape from whatever pain and sorrow they might be going through. The joint experience of watching nature LIVE provides a special connection; with the animals and guides, but also with others who are watching at the same time. it builds community and friendships, even marriages in some cases... “…I’m currently living with a very slow-progressing terminal illness. My only window to the outside world is my tablet, but I’m often too ill to communicate with others even via social media. Your show has helped me through many long, lonely, and often painful nights. Most importantly, safariLIVE gives my mind a door to the outside world. I never tire of the realization that the things I’m seeing on my screen are happening right that very moment half a world away. Words simply cannot express how important this twice daily outing has become to me, how much I look forward to it, or how much it has improved my quality of life.” – Brooke We at WildEarth remain dedicated to providing this special connection and will continue to work hard to achieve this. We've seen the positive impact it's had on people young and old, healthy or ill, and do not want to give up on that. And 'with a little help from our friends', we want to continue doing so!If ever there was a time our mission has the ability to improve people's lives, now is it! What we will do if we exceed our target.The more money we raise, the longer we can keep broadcasting. Our first goal is to raise the around $70,000 we need to keep doing so through April, but we would love to raise enough to secure them until June. Help us spread the word!Beyond contributing financially to this campaign, there are various other ways you can help us, e.g. by spreading the word about this far and wide among your friends, relatives, local radio stations, and anybody else who is willing to listen…",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p> My name is Bill Brock. I am extremely passionate about solving mysteries like alien abductions, cryptid sightings and the mysteries of the ancient mound builders. In the past I hosted <i>Monsters Underground</i> a show featured on Discovery Channel and Destination America. Now I am taking that experience to locations that may reveal connections between the Ancients and the extraterrestrial.  With your help, Rogue Mysteries will research and hopefully solve the questions we all have:  Do aliens exist? Are portals real? Did the ancient mound builders have alien contact? These are just a few questions you can help us answer. </p>
<p> Funding for this project makes it possible to properly explore and research these mysteries. Our goal is $5000.00. We need to access specific locations like the University of New Hampshire, which requires a hefty sum just to access the archive. We need to shoot there to tell the full story of Betty and Barney Hill, given that the university holds all the artifacts from the abduction. The next few episodes will have us travel to the Allagash to investigate the abduction that happened there in 1976. Other costs include food, travel and equipment, not to mention the cost of wardrobe, makeup, and graphic design. As you can see, costs add up quickly so please help us make this dream a reality with your donations. </p>

<h3>About the Bear Lake Monster Video</h3>
<p>Despite the quaint charm of Garden City or the fact that thousands of tourists visit the eerie blue waters of Bear Lake every year, there is a dark, mysterious secret swimming below the surface. The mystery of the Bear Lake Monster has not yet been conclusively solved although rumors of monsters have been floating around since at least the 1800s. Stories of a monster were passed down by early pioneer settlers and maybe even the native people before them. </p>
<p>Our team intends to make a spectacular YouTube video about the Bear Lake Monster just in time for Halloween in 2019. Some videos about the topic have hundreds of thousands of views and we plan for this video to rise to the top of search results. Our video will be informative and as accurate as possible. We have already interviewed faculty at Utah State University in the Folklore Department on-camera. We have also already secured partnerships with local businesses.</p>

And I thought to myself, “This is real life right now.” </p><p>As I look to my left, a strange man, half naked (in what I can describe to you as a woman’s butterfly bathing suit top and blue booty shorts to match, his name written all over himself in magic marker), sitting at my desk, waiting for me to get off the phone so that he could “properly” ask me out on a date. His idea of “proper” of course, was to pick me up in a Ferrari (which he did not own), and to take me to dinner at a fancy Beverly Hills Restaurant, all after only just revealing to me that he dropped $500 to legally change his name to “Sexy Vegan.” I politely declined, but, alas, that was enough for him to make a scene upon exiting the building. Believe me, I WISH I were making this  up. </p><p>And so,  I confirm: “This truly is REAL LIFE.” So real, in fact, that I could not have possibly have kept it all to myself. I needed to share it with you. Thus, a TV show was born.  <br/> </p><p><strong>The Story:</strong><br/>REPS is a workplace comedy about the sales team at a gym. But it is not about trendy work-outs, personal training tips, or the proper nutrition guide you need to getting that rock solid body just in time for the summer, no. Reps is about what you don't know; what you don’t realize is actually happening while you are minding your own business on your treadmill, or in that yoga class, or on that bench press. It’s about what’s really happening when you walk into the gym to “shop around,” and how you got manipulated into a committed membership when you only actually walked in to “try it out.” It’s about the real people, the real situations, and the real experiences I witnessed within 12 months of working as a Sales Representative at your gym. </p><p>Told through the comedic perspective of one protagonist, Maggie, REPS will show you the ins and outs of the fitness industry through the way of the people that make all the wheels churn. Oh, and all the mishaps, misunderstandings, and shenanigans that happen along the way. More than that, REPS is a perfect example the journey; becoming who you are meant to be, and about the people that help you through it all. My name is Jacqueline Marie, and I have come together with Willow House Films to bring to you an original comedy series, REPS.  <br/> </p><p><strong>Meet The Reps:</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491198349/hc1gjsujkycp9oyiuu0g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><strong>Maggie:</strong> “The Newbie,” New to L.A, new to the gym, and new to the job.  She is smart, witty, sarcastic and a walking accident waiting to happen.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491198367/ynrfn6hu3s8wihepbn10.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><strong>Dylan:</strong> “The Eccentric One,” The membership manager for Reps Health Club, he also acts as Maggie’s mentor.

And I thought to myself, “This is real life right now.” As I look to my left, a strange man, half naked (in what I can describe to you as a woman’s butterfly bathing suit top and blue booty shorts to match, his name written all over himself in magic marker), sitting at my desk, waiting for me to get off the phone so that he could “properly” ask me out on a date. His idea of “proper” of course, was to pick me up in a Ferrari (which he did not own), and to take me to dinner at a fancy Beverly Hills Restaurant, all after only just revealing to me that he dropped $500 to legally change his name to “Sexy Vegan.” I politely declined, but, alas, that was enough for him to make a scene upon exiting the building. Believe me, I WISH I were making this  up. And so,  I confirm: “This truly is REAL LIFE.” So real, in fact, that I could not have possibly have kept it all to myself. I needed to share it with you. Thus, a TV show was born.   The Story:REPS is a workplace comedy about the sales team at a gym.

</div></div>","Short Summary
When Kevin Bell (Frank Beckwith) and Joy Thompson (Jordan Johnson) meet in an unusual scenario, their lives take an unexpected turn. Visualize Eddie Murphy’s suave character in Boomerang and Sana Lathan’s girl next door charm in The Best Man. Then you mix the vibe and music of Brown Sugar, infused with Jazz and Hip Hop. This is the essence of The Very Thought of You.
What's going on everyone?!
I'm super excited for this project! The Very Thought of You is a passion project that I have created with the loving spirit of 90's and 00's romantic-dramedies in mind. I wanted to bring back sexy love stories with relatable characters, that you are challenged by.
We need YOUR help to achieve this goal! We have plenty of ways for you to get involved and we can't wait to work together to achieve this goal. Let's get it!!!

What We Need & What You Get

Let's get to business, for season one of the show we are looking for $15,000. This will help fund the entire first season of the series.
We have unique perks with fun names relating to aspects and vibe we are going for in the show. Some perks include digit downloads (expected spring 2021), bonded signed episode scripts, sign posters, cameo appearance, t-shirts, hats, exclusive Virtual Watch Party invites and much more! Please look into the perks section!
If the goal isn't reached we will still use the funds raised to pay for production expenses.

The Company
                                                   
Focal Beam Entertainment L.L.C. is a new multimedia production company founded by Frank Beckwith. The Very Thought of You will be the company's first project, with many more to come in the future.
 

The Impact
YOU are a critical component to the success of the project! I can't understate that EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS! Besides the financial support, this project also provide jobs for the cast and crew!
                                             Here is a chart of the budget estimate.

<h3>Director's Statement</h3>
<p><i>‘I would love to create memorable characters that might inspire another young girl who doesn’t yet understand that being funny can be more than her forte, but her career. I grew up watching Kathy Burke as Linda La Hughes in, ‘Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie.’ She was the first female comedy character actor that I adored, I would mimic her character again and again. I love what I do, especially when it makes others laugh and with your help I have the opportunity to bring my characters to life and do them justice.’</i></p>
<p>(Extra Information) Jess McDonagh credits: On her second Stand Up Comedy gig she ‘Beat the Frog’ at Manchester's infamous Frog and Bucket comedy club, winning the competition. She can be seen in the Mentos: Say Hello Advert and has starred in a multiple short films and theater productions around the UK including She in ‘The Pensive Federation’ Oldham Coliseum, Filming for both ITV and the BBC  as a performer in Just some Sketch night and having previously trained in Clowning. After the sell out tour of her Richard  III inspired satire Car Park King, she has always continued to develop unique and quirky characters. The play will be going on it’s second nationwide tour over Autumn 2019.</p>

<h3>What is ""On Air""?</h3>
<p>On Air is an award winning, single camera sitcom that follows the cast and crew of a hit variety show and their lives after the camera's stop rolling. It takes the wacky and off the wall characters of <i><strong>Community, </strong></i>mixes it with the style of <i><strong>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</strong></i>, and puts them all in a <i><strong>30 Rock</strong></i> like setting.</p>
<p>After the dismissal of his mentor due to sexual harassment claims, the star of a hit variety show clashes with its bubbly, energetic producer, who seems desperate for approval. Opposites attract... sometimes, in this hilarious sitcoms that show the best stories truly are the ones that happen off camera.</p>
<p>A week after the producer of <i>Weekly Tonight</i>, <strong>Carl Norman</strong>, is fired due to sexual harassment accusations, HR is interviewing the cast. Everyone is understandably caught off guard, most notably the show's easy going, sarcastic, and immature star, <strong>Josh Tilson</strong>, who co-created the series with Carl and feels a sense of loyalty to him. The rest of the cast is made up of <strong>Melanie Reed</strong>, the once disgraced child star turned social justice advocate, <strong>Jebediah Polumbo</strong>, the eccentric and politically incorrect English comedian, <strong>Chris Key</strong>, Josh's underachieving and stoner best friend since child hood, and new girl, Emma Ricci, who hails from Hollywood royalty and is trying to break free of her family's shadow.</p>
<p>The mega conservative Polumbo believes that Carl shouldn't have been fired based on one accusation, claiming ""it's never been harder to be a straight, white, male than right now."" while the uber liberal Melanie passionately disagrees, claiming that we should believe victims. The exchange is interrupted when Josh sees <strong>Alan Pattinson</strong>, the network executive's pushover son, and questions him about the Carl's termination. Alan reveals to the cast that he has enough on his plate, and in addition to a journalist coming in to interview them, the new producer of the show will also be introducing himself. Emma then notices an older gentlemen walk into the building, sporting a suit and brief case. He introduces him as <b>Harold Krepps</b>, a no non sense, boring, dry, individual, who comes off more as a robot than a human. Josh comes to the conclusion that this must be the new producer, and he spends the day with Harold, hoping to feel him out.</p>
<p>While Josh and Harold spend the day together, Melanie and Polumbo continue their debate about sexual harassment, while Emma, Alan, and Chris, all feeling they don't belong, try to figure their place among the cast and life in general. During this, <strong>Richard Dyer</strong>, a flamboyant, happy go lucky, and upbeat family man, is hanging out in the break room and gets to know each of the cast members.</p>
<h3><strong>Who Am I?</strong></h3>
<p>I'm Ryan Conway, the creator and star of <i>On Air</i>. I'm a 23 year old actor/comedian/writer who graduated from Sacred Heart University (In Fairfield Connecticut) last spring, with a degree in communications and a focus on film and television! </p>
<p>For as long as I could remember, I always loved to make people laugh and smile. I just like making people happy. I think that there's already enough negativity in this world, so I just like to be positive and try to spread that with whatever I do, whether it's in my work or even just talking to someone on the street.</p>
<p>Quick story: At age 2, doctors found a brain tumor and diagnosed me with brain cancer. Luckily, I was fortunate and it was able to get it removed, and my parents paid for the best physical therapists to make sure that I was able to regain all of my motor skills and go back to who I was before. It was a long road - that's what they tell me, I don't really remember - but, all throughout I would apparently watch a lot of television, most notably comedies. I guess it gave me some kind of reassurance to watch something and laugh when going through what I did.</p>
<p>At age 10, I enrolled in John Robert Powers Agency. I took classes, had a couple auditions for commercials, etc. After a year, I quit (because I guess in my 11 year old mind, I should've made it big by then!) When I was 15, I got the bug again, and joined interFACE talent agency. There I was able to score background roles on shows such as <i>Orange is the New Black</i> and <i>Blue Bloods</i>. I left the agency after two years and went to college to pursue a communications degree.</p>
<p>I took multiple production/film/ television courses in my four years, and was involved in a variety of videos (I was the head writer and one of the stars of my university's variety show, <i>Daylight</i>, among other things). My senior year, I was tasked to come up with a final project that would utilize everything I learned throughout my undergraduate career. I decided to make my own sitcom, something that would make people laugh and smile, the way all the sitcoms I watched growing up did for me.</p>
<p>The result was <i>On Air</i>. It was a single camera sitcom I wrote, directed, and starred in. The cast was made up of myself and a number of friends, all of whom had never acted before, we used non professional equipment, etc. It was a very amateur production, and you could probably write a book on what a nightmare it was to shoot (Just to give you a sense of what we dealt with, we were forced to recast one of the main roles a week before the project was due). Despite all of this the original pilot was very well received by those who saw it. It won the award for ""Best TV Show"" at the Sacred Heart University Senior Honors, and even did well in festivals, earning the title of ""Finalist"" five times in addition to five ""Official Selections"". Point being, it came out so much better than I imagined.</p>
<p>Call it wishful thinking (I call it confidence), but I think we have something really special. Am I a bit biased? Sure, but I truly believe this could be something big, and I wanted to give it the care an attention it deserves.</p>
<p>I went back and rewrote the entire pilot script. It's funnier, more structured, the characters are more fleshed out, etc. and I would love for nothing more than to bring it to you. </p>
<h3>What we Need.</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We are seeking $8,000 (flexible goal) to help fund the production of <i>On Air's</i> new pilot. The money would be handled by me, and would go towards getting a full crew behind the scenes, better equipment, paying our amazingly talented cast, craft services and meals so everyone is fed and hydrated during shoot days, hotels for talent that would be coming out of state, make up, music royalties, hand sanitizer and masks to stay safe and clean during COVID, etc.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, the cast was made up of people who had no prior acting experience, we had non professional equipment, and we shot the pilot for no money, but it still came out great. This begs the question why would I need $8,000 to shoot it again? Well, a couple of reasons; We filmed the original pilot (37 minutes in length) in 6 months. All the actors were friends of mine and were doing it for free, so we shot on their schedule. I'm lucky I even finished episode 1, because we tried to shoot an episode 2 by the same means, but it proved to be lightning in a bottle, and I realized another episode couldn't be done in those conditions. Secondly, even though I am extremely proud of what we managed to do, I think it could be a lot better. The lighting, sound, and other technical aspects in the pilot are severely lacking, and I believe that if the technical aspect is on the same level as the content in the episode, it will be something truly great. Lastly, I mentioned above the success the original pilot has when it comes to awards and festivals. The way I see it, if we can accomplish all of that with what limited resources we had, imagine what we can do with some help.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, then we'll still use whatever funds we have to produce the pilot episode for <i>On Air</i>, we would just have to adjust the budget. If we manage to make more money than we asked for, we will put it towards a potential second episode, publicity to get eyes on the pilot, even more resources to help production, etc. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>In this section, they told me to write how my project is valuable to the contributor (you) and the world. To be honest, I don't really know how to answer this. I'm not going to tell you""This needs to be in the world because A, B, and, C."" However, I will say that I think the world could always use more positivity, more laughter, and more things that can bring us together, rather than split us apart, and I think that <i>On Air</i>, even if its contribution to that is small, can contribute nonetheless. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're pretty much living through the definition of a risk and a challenge regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, which will admittedly make it hard to film. Rest assured, all of our crew would be socially distanced, they, along with cast members who aren't on camera, would be wearing masks, we would have hand sanitizer on set for people to clean their hands throughout the day, gloves, meals in individual containers, etc.</p>
<p>We will also require everyone who will be on set to get a COVID test before production, and we will check their temperatures every day when they arrive on set. It will also be mandatory for the cast and crew to quarantine two weeks before production.</p>
<p>It's also possible that someone involved in the production might be test positive for COVID-19. If this is the case, then everyone else would be required to get a COVID test and self quarantine. If the test  comes back negative, then those individuals would resume production. </p>
<p>Other than that, a ton of things could go wrong, scheduling could be screwed up, an actor/actress could not feel comfortable coming in anymore because of COVID, or anything in between. However, you've heard about  my experience shooting the original pilot, and to be honest, the thing I learned most about that experience is how to adjust on the fly, and take things in stride. So, I believe whatever other obstacles come our way, we'll be ready to deal with them and come up with alternative solutions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Else Can I Help?</h3>
<p>We understand that during this uncertain times, it might be hard to contribute, and that's totally fine! However, you can still help us grow and help our ultimate goal with getting this on the air(no pun intended. Okay, pun kind of intended). You can follow us on our Instagram @OnAir_TVShow. You could also watch and give a like to the original <i>On Air</i> pilot, which is currently on YouTube. You could help spread the word of it, and who knows, maybe the more people that know about us gives us some new opportunities. You can share this campaign to other people who might potentially want to invest. The possibilities are endless! Help us grow, help <i>On Air</i> get noticed, help us make this something big, by any means necessary!</p>

By embarking on a penniless quest and relying solely on the kindness of strangers, plus a supportive online community, to get you from place to place, you set the stage for those great unforgettable journeys of a lifetime, creating lasting friendships and bonds, and re-affirming so much of the good that still exists in our often troubled world. ATWFF sees the world with eyes wide open, yet transcends politics. It allows viewers to vicariously travel with our hosts, on a feel-good journey of discovery which never grows old.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509377665/yp1t1t23txcty6se9ysj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Our friend and <i>ATWFF Season 2</i> host <strong>Jeff Schroeder</strong> embarked on one such epic journey. His 106-day non-stop trek took him through 12 countries and over 29,000 miles, from climbing Mount Fuji in Japan to delivering aid to floating villages in Cambodia, to skydiving in England and so much more. It was a real-time trip, guided by locals on the ground and the online audience, and told through a series of daily webisodes, which were edited and posted from the road. These real-time webisodes (56 in all) captured the quick essence of Jeff's trip, but could not tell his full and complete story, given the limitations of the format, doing it on the fly. The ATWFF team's intent, much like it had done with the pioneering Season 1 journey (with host and co-creator Alex Boylan), was to properly sit down in post-production, go through the many hundreds of hours of Jeff's footage, and properly craft a fresh feature-length documentary that told a more complete tale of the global trek, with additional participants and previously-unseen content that we simply could not do in the webisode format.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509377769/smy1unc9mh6afyiyvpq3.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>However, after the Season 2 filming with Jeff wrapped, the production team moved on to Season 3 (with host Parvati Shallow) and in the subsequent time period the project rights temporarily restricted our abilities to re-package the material into a new series or documentary... until now! Our boutique creative shop is once again in a position to delve into the great content which we still have ""in the can"", and do it justice. We are also working hard at bringing back new production seasons of our show - stay tuned - so we definitely want all of the existing seasons to shine.</p><p>Bottom line - Jeff's <i>ATWFF</i> story deserves to be told in full, as his many fans continually remind us!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509377975/wd0sb5md2a9rgvs0zzxs.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>How this Indiegogo campaign will help</h3><p>In the changing media and broadcast landscape, it is difficult to secure funding via existing methods for the post-production component of a project. <i>ATWFF</i> 2's first iteration was a web show, and getting money from our traditional broadcast partners, to re-edit it into a new format - such as a feature-length documentary - is difficult. Crowdfunding creates far less red tape, allows us to move faster and provides much greater creative freedom in shaping the doc that we know our audience will want. It will ""unlock"" the potential that still exists in the great un-tapped footage from Jeff's season. We are very excited to create a feature-documentary version of <i>ATWFF 2</i>, we feel that it will really engage audiences in the long-form adventure-travel format, plus it's something we haven't done yet with <i>ATWFF</i>. Your help will allow us to share Jeff's full story worldwide, with fans and supporters plus millions more who crave the content beyond the webisodes. Season 1 of <i>ATWFF</i> aired multiple times domestically in the US (on WGN and Outside TV) and via National Geographic and other broadcasters in all territories worldwide.

By embarking on a penniless quest and relying solely on the kindness of strangers, plus a supportive online community, to get you from place to place, you set the stage for those great unforgettable journeys of a lifetime, creating lasting friendships and bonds, and re-affirming so much of the good that still exists in our often troubled world. ATWFF sees the world with eyes wide open, yet transcends politics. It allows viewers to vicariously travel with our hosts, on a feel-good journey of discovery which never grows old.Our friend and ATWFF Season 2 host Jeff Schroeder embarked on one such epic journey. His 106-day non-stop trek took him through 12 countries and over 29,000 miles, from climbing Mount Fuji in Japan to delivering aid to floating villages in Cambodia, to skydiving in England and so much more. It was a real-time trip, guided by locals on the ground and the online audience, and told through a series of daily webisodes, which were edited and posted from the road. These real-time webisodes (56 in all) captured the quick essence of Jeff's trip, but could not tell his full and complete story, given the limitations of the format, doing it on the fly. The ATWFF team's intent, much like it had done with the pioneering Season 1 journey (with host and co-creator Alex Boylan), was to properly sit down in post-production, go through the many hundreds of hours of Jeff's footage, and properly craft a fresh feature-length documentary that told a more complete tale of the global trek, with additional participants and previously-unseen content that we simply could not do in the webisode format.However, after the Season 2 filming with Jeff wrapped, the production team moved on to Season 3 (with host Parvati Shallow) and in the subsequent time period the project rights temporarily restricted our abilities to re-package the material into a new series or documentary... until now! Our boutique creative shop is once again in a position to delve into the great content which we still have ""in the can"", and do it justice. We are also working hard at bringing back new production seasons of our show - stay tuned - so we definitely want all of the existing seasons to shine.Bottom line - Jeff's ATWFF story deserves to be told in full, as his many fans continually remind us!How this Indiegogo campaign will helpIn the changing media and broadcast landscape, it is difficult to secure funding via existing methods for the post-production component of a project. ATWFF 2's first iteration was a web show, and getting money from our traditional broadcast partners, to re-edit it into a new format - such as a feature-length documentary - is difficult. Crowdfunding creates far less red tape, allows us to move faster and provides much greater creative freedom in shaping the doc that we know our audience will want. It will ""unlock"" the potential that still exists in the great un-tapped footage from Jeff's season. We are very excited to create a feature-documentary version of ATWFF 2, we feel that it will really engage audiences in the long-form adventure-travel format, plus it's something we haven't done yet with ATWFF. Your help will allow us to share Jeff's full story worldwide, with fans and supporters plus millions more who crave the content beyond the webisodes. Season 1 of ATWFF aired multiple times domestically in the US (on WGN and Outside TV) and via National Geographic and other broadcasters in all territories worldwide. Besides our cable partners we are working hard to secure a VOD home for ATWFF 2 as well.*** For this final leg of our campaign, we have updated our fundraising target to $7.5K, to go towards the feature documentary (please note however, the Indiegogo platform still displays our original target of $65K since the figure cannot be revised post-campaign launch)The work to be done consists primarily of editing, as well as music and sound design, colour correction, and show graphics preparation. Most of these creative tasks will be executed personally by ATWFF co-creator and Emmy-nominated editor Zsolt Luka, who also directed the series, edited the Season 2 webisodes and also edited the TV episodes of the first ATWFF (hosted by Alex). Additionally, the funds will also cover some fees for closed-captioning and formatting/outputting/delivering the feature documentary for the broadcast and VOD markets.Funding strategy** REVISED ** We have internally scaled back our funding target from the initial $65K (posted) to focus solely on the feature documentary's post-production target of $7.5K, which will allow us to deliver the feature-length film.If we are unable to hit the revised documentary fundraising target, we will reduce the scope of the film but still complete the production and bring it to market.We gratefully appreciate all support for this endeavour!The ATWFF teamATWFF was created by Alex Boylan, Zsolt Luka and Burton Roberts. We are a tight-knit team of veteran travellers and media producers.

<p>Classic Alice is the brainchild of series creator and star, Kate Hackett.

<p>We've ended our YouTube run with much acclaim -- yay! -- but we don't want to just rest on our laurels, so it's time to take Alice on the road!</p>
<p>To Kate's total SURPRISE!! Amazon requires FCC-grade closed captioning. This wasn't really very clear in their interface. Kate has hitherto recut everything, but when faced with closed captions, she started to cry.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3><u><strong>Backstory</strong></u></h3><p>Our vision for Love in America was largely romantic at first, collecting video interviews and photos supporting a book on love stories from across America. But particularly after our 2016 Journey, we encountered a profound longing across the country for Americans to reconnect in a wider sense, to overcome divisions and redefine a shared American identity. Americans are lonely, uncertain who we are, unsure how to come together, and those divisions are often intentionally exploited, for many reasons. Having encountered through our work communities across the country with very different cultures and histories, but strikingly similar concerns for the land we share, we realized two things. First, every community and culture is built around the important things that its people have in common. And, love is the most essential and meaningful of these. The love we discover and reveal isn’t simple romance, but the kind Dr. Martin Luther King, a man who understood love’s power, meant when he said, “When I speak of love I am not speaking of some sentimental and weak response. I am not speaking of that force which is just emotional bosh. I am speaking of that force which all of the great religions have seen as the supreme unifying principle of life.” And America needs that unity, breaking the stereotypes that divide us and opening minds and hearts to one another - today, more than ever.</p><p>Not only is love our best hope, but it happens in America in unique, compelling, and often pretty funny ways! We knew through our experience on the American road that telling its tales creates a space for that power to bring many Americans together, offering genuine hope, a sense of shared purpose, and more than a few laughs...the next best thing to share and unite people!</p><p>To enable us to produce this series and to engage a wider audience, we need YOUR help! Contribute NOW to make Love in America a reality!!</p><h3>The Team</h3><p>Yep, it’s just the two of us, and YOU! We’re capable, working hard, and with your help, looking forward to growing!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557613393/pfoyzfpbido6uklkzqsa.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Scotte Burns writing has been featured in OnStage Magazine, The Coachella Review, Evening Street Press, Nth Degree SciFi/Fantasy, The GNU Journal, the Rocky Mountain News, Westword, and other publications.

We have contacted several interested pros who are waiting in the wings for the generosity and support of people who see the need for love in America.

But particularly after our 2016 Journey, we encountered a profound longing across the country for Americans to reconnect in a wider sense, to overcome divisions and redefine a shared American identity. Americans are lonely, uncertain who we are, unsure how to come together, and those divisions are often intentionally exploited, for many reasons. Having encountered through our work communities across the country with very different cultures and histories, but strikingly similar concerns for the land we share, we realized two things. First, every community and culture is built around the important things that its people have in common. And, love is the most essential and meaningful of these. The love we discover and reveal isn’t simple romance, but the kind Dr. Martin Luther King, a man who understood love’s power, meant when he said, “When I speak of love I am not speaking of some sentimental and weak response. I am not speaking of that force which is just emotional bosh. I am speaking of that force which all of the great religions have seen as the supreme unifying principle of life.” And America needs that unity, breaking the stereotypes that divide us and opening minds and hearts to one another - today, more than ever.Not only is love our best hope, but it happens in America in unique, compelling, and often pretty funny ways! We knew through our experience on the American road that telling its tales creates a space for that power to bring many Americans together, offering genuine hope, a sense of shared purpose, and more than a few laughs...the next best thing to share and unite people!To enable us to produce this series and to engage a wider audience, we need YOUR help! Contribute NOW to make Love in America a reality!!The TeamYep, it’s just the two of us, and YOU! We’re capable, working hard, and with your help, looking forward to growing!Scotte Burns writing has been featured in OnStage Magazine, The Coachella Review, Evening Street Press, Nth Degree SciFi/Fantasy, The GNU Journal, the Rocky Mountain News, Westword, and other publications. He is a former secondary English teacher with a B.A. in English and an MFA in Creative Nonfiction.  In addition to teaching and writing, Scotte is a songwriter and musician/vocalist and has written much of the music for Love in America. He has also been a Renaissance Festival swordsman, a floral supply wholesaler, a traffic signal repairman, and cab driver. At home in the Black Hills of South Dakota, he leads tours and tells stories of Deadwood history and the life of Wild Bill Hickok. He loves dogs and some other people's cats.Toni Burns is a natural born speaker, bewildered by Americans being more afraid of public speaking than death. With a B.A. in Organizational Development and Communications, she revels in turning her obsession for research and storytelling into engaging and entertaining live presentations. She has also co-authored two fantasy novels, Fated, Book 1 of the Lorn Prophecy and Fable, Book 1 from the Djenrye Chronicles. Her love of gardening and growy things blossomed into publication in Rodale’s Organic Gardening Magazine. A biker and bicyclist, bartender and author, Renaissance Festival full-plate-metal-comedic-fighter and cookie-baking mom, carnivorous environmentalist and dog lover, born in Greece and raised in Kentucky, Toni is a bit paradoxical. A uniqueness that drives her seeking to understand other people’s heads and hearts.Married (to each other) for 37 years, Scotte and Toni have raised two kids and a menagerie of animals, breaking a couple bones and more than a few rules along the way.

Every dollar of this minimum goal will go toward road expenses and budget equipment to shoot and produce footage for the series, which we’ll produce ourselves upon return (line-item budget available on request). If we exceed the goal, we'll extend the route and have even more to offer! Either way, we’ll continue to do everything we can between us to bring out these stories and to offer this much needed message with the same passion and devotion that’s taken us this far.There’s so much more possible if the two of us could get some help, though, especially with a camera/sound person or two, help with scheduling and communications, professional post-production assistance, and marketing to reach that wider audience and grow the project in coming years, including offering the field work as an intern opportunity for multimedia students at our local Black Hills State University. We have contacted several interested pros who are waiting in the wings for the generosity and support of people who see the need for love in America. So, if we reach our minimum goal, we have a secondary goal/plan of 20,000 USD ready to make the good stuff happen sooner, and betterer (ahem), with their help!The PerksAnd, as if giving a voice to love in America weren’t enough, there is something else in it for you, too!! When you contribute, you can opt to receive something in return! Please check out our perks; They are pretty awesome! And, because this is just the two of us, they offer you something valuable while not keeping us from doing the work you’re actually supporting!Want examples? $25?

You also get officially thanked in the show credits and on our website, and receive Tales from The Heart of America (our book) stories as they are written! $100 gets the early access, credits, Tales, and a signed photo from the Journey you helped make happen! $250 brings you all the above, and an author signed copy, once published, of the Love in America book, Tales from The Heart of America! At $500, you’ll receive early access, credit, art photo, Tales, the signed book, and we’ll interview and tell the story of a couple of your choice on our podcast or along an upcoming Love in America Journey. $1000 Grand Donors receive all that, plus a guided motorcycle tour of the Black Hills including Sturgis, Crazy Horse, Deadwood, Needles Highway, Mt. Rushmore, and a few spots that don’t make the tourism guides!

We want the inspiration, hope and unity of these tales to reach America through the documentary web series  - with the footage we produce later being adapted for an unscripted television pilot and possible documentary film. While we’ve gotten this far with just the two of us, learning enough videography, photography, audio, podcasting, marketing and other skills to bring you what you see here, we need help to keep going and to produce the upcoming journey at a  professional level and give this important message its best chance to reach a wider audience.

<p>Character breakdowns:</p>
<p>KARL ABCOTT - a young man in his late 20’s, brown-red hair, about 5’10.’’ He’s confident,<br/>unassuming and very likeable; the unofficial leader of the “roomies” who has to make sure<br/>to keep every other roomie’s heads out of the clouds, including his, and keep them fighting<br/>to be inside.</p>
<p>MERL GADECKI - a young man, mid 30’s, about 6’. Even with a tumultuous<br/>childhood, growing up and all, he’s not too optimistic about moving in with Karl, especially<br/>since his newest challenge brings him in with three other roommates scrunched in and he‘s<br/>up in arms about whether or not he’s made a good choice about it.</p>
<p>PETE PURGRESC - a young man, mid 20’s, mid-height, scruffy-looking, black hair and<br/>Canadian. In good spirits much of the time, but feels just as Karl and the other do that<br/>they’re cornered into the back wall and he’s only along for the ride, but he’s there to<br/>pitch in.</p>
<p>JEREMIAH “JER” JACOFFE - a young man, early 20’s, brown brunette hair, mid-height,<br/>almost heavy-set and feels he’s tagging along also, but he thinks this whole story’s over<br/>before it even starts. None too bright at one time or another, he may as well be on some<br/>occasions a foil for the roomies which may prove true to land all of them homeless.</p>
<p>DOUGRAY “LORD” LAND - late 30’s/early 40’s, but looks real young for his age, large and<br/>tall, persistent and major authority figure at times, especially for a landlord like him. He<br/>feels that the roomies are slackers trying to pass him off easily for a fool just to stay at<br/>Somber Wind. But he believes to knows better and he’ll do just about anything to see<br/>them out of his complex for good.</p>
<p>HEATHER ANODES - mid 30’s, red haired and slender-type. One of the assistants<br/>to Dougray who takes no guff from anyone and is clearly loyal to the “Lord of the Land.”<br/>But soon after, she might take a different perspective on how the roomies are handling<br/>their situation and lend them a hand.</p>

<p>Born to Military parents, Britni Raine became a nomad at birth, moving from place to place across the country for most of her childhood, before finally settling in the Chicago suburbs. She began studying voice and acting in the city seriously and passionately, knowing at the age of nine that her end game was in front of a rolling camera.​</p>
<p>It would only be a few short years before Britni would land her first professional role in David Huzieran’s short Ordinary World. After the director saw her heading to the extra’s holding and auditioned her right on the spot. Shortly after relocating to Los Angeles, she would play the distraught, reckless party girl in Marttie Go’s High School, I Hate You, and be given the opportunity to study with Erica Daniels of Steppenwolf Theatre, Adam Belcuore of The Goodman Theatre, and Bob Mason of The Chicago Shakespeare Theatre, requiring her to move back to The Windy City.​</p>
<p>From then on, Britni would be the first to workshop the character of Zoe in broadway’s Airline Highway (nominated for four Tony awards in 2015), under the direction of Tony award winner Joe Mantello, would go on to win the recurring bad-influence, druggie Jenna on Lifetime’s Army Wives, and take on the comedic role of Kianna, seen most recently in Showtime’s Shameless.</p>
<p>Now based in Los Angeles, Britni is also completing an online degree in psychology with the University of Arizona, and currently writing/starring in an untitled short film with fellow Chicagoan actress, Melanie Neilan. The film revolves around a seemingly odd and abusive relationship between two young women, and the microcosm-like ways in which young adults express love and sexuality through individual romantic relationships.</p>

<p>I was born in Cologne, Germany, to a German father and American mother. Shortly after I was born I moved to Austria, then Holland and eventually back to Germany, Munich, where I lived until I finished high school. I had been a part of multiple plays throughout junior and middle school, but it was in high school that I really fell in with acting and the art of storytelling.</p>
<p>I started doing whatever I could to act: I went to summer camps including SOCAPA and NYFA, I would work with the film students at my school, I helped the Theater Department in school, as well as acted in a few plays, and I directed, produced and acted in my own short film. It was around this time that my mother also began producing her own short films and I, seizing every opportunity I could, would help her on set being a Runner whenever possible.​</p>
<p>The summer between my junior and senior year I was introduced to Anthony Meindl and Anthony Meindl’s Actor’s Workshop (AMAW) and I immediately fell in love with the work he does and helps create. After graduating from high school I moved to the US to pursue a career in Acting. I spent the first 4 months interning at and acting with the Community Theater in Truckee, as well as starring in my first feature film, <i><strong>2hrs</strong></i>; a film I not only acted in, but was also a Runner on set and Locations Assistant for. In December 2015 I moved to L.A to finally study full time at AMAW. Film and acting have become a huge part of my life. I love the creative, limitless, exciting energy found on film sets, and the boundless potential every moment holds while acting and discovering a scene.</p>

<p>I grew up in Corona, CA and moved to Downey in 9th grade so I can be closer to LA to pursue my acting career. I was always pretty shy &amp; stuck in my shell growing up until my mom decided to have me try an acting class for fun when I was twelve. My mom started acting/modeling in New York when she was sixteen and thought maybe it would be something I'd enjoy as well.​</p>
<p>When I first started classes I was afraid to mess up or look stupid. But as classes went on I slowly came out of my shell &amp; was no longer afraid to take chances. As I got older and started to understand more about myself, acting classes also became like therapy sessions. It forced me to let out emotions and feelings I never knew how to express and release.</p>

<p>I was born in Northern Virginia and lived near the D.C. area until I was 7 years old.  My family then moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, where I spent 8 more years.  According to my mother, I came out of the womb a drama queen.  Singing and acting has always been my number one passion, and my parents knew it.  They sent me to singing lessons, dance classes, musical theatre productions—all of which I excelled in and loved. </p>
<p>When I got older I fell in love with rock music, starting with Evanescence and spreading to 80s hair bands and modern heavy metal.  To this day I continue to sing in the shower, around friends, on stage—everywhere.  Even the grocery store.</p>
<p>When I was 15 I starting attending monthly acting classes in Nashville with Gray Studios.  They were stationed in LA, and it wasn’t long before they were encouraging me to become stationed there as well.  The summer of 2014 was the first time I went to California with my mom, and since then I have fallen in love with the exuberant energy of the professional acting world. </p>
<p>Being an energetic person myself, the eternal “life” of the city never ceases to amaze me.  I started taking classes with Gray Studios every week and eventually worked my way up to the David Gray Master Class.  I also work weekly with Amy Lyndon, a booking coach who has appealed to my analytical side.   Both classes have helped me grow tremendously, and aided in my discovery of what kind of actor I am.</p>
<p>Aside from acting, I like to play video games, hang with my friends, learn stuff at my college, and discover new things.  I’m always down for a hike or trip to Six Flags.  I think it’s important to be well-rounded, as it can greatly benefit not only my acting career, but also my personal life!</p>

<p>His first job was the lead in a short film with director Casey Zimmerman who said “John Paul takes time to find the authenticity in the scene and the core of his character. I had complete trust in him to bring the emotion in some very intense scenes.”​</p>
<p>Since then, John Paul has gone on to book several commercials, including a project very special to him: the PSA “UNACCEPTABLE ACCEPTANCE” which brings attention to the issue of date rape on college campuses. He can be seen in several episodes of “Blood Relatives” on ID and as one of the leads in the upcoming feature film “AMERICAN EXORCISM” directed by Tripp Weathers.​</p>

ABOUT THE SERIES
Reckless Juliets, a cross between Heathers and The Virgin Suicides, is a web series focusing on four friends navigating their way through high school, and dealing with issues surrounding their home lives, while being young women of the Millennial generation.
The show's storytelling combines dark comedy with character driven drama featuring a talented young cast. Some of the themes that we touch on are mental heath, body positivity, suicide awareness, teen rebellion, LGBTQ representation, and most importantly, the complexity of women and their friendships with one another. Because as shocking as it may sound by what audiences see on film and television nowadays, YES, women are quite interesting to watch and all have stories waiting to be told. 
Episodes one through five are online for your viewing pleasure, but we need help to make the last half of the season a reality. That's where you, the fans, come in. If you haven't seen our episodes yet, don't worry, they're all listed below for your convenience.

  BRITNI RAINE | ""CARMODY SHAW""

Born to Military parents, Britni Raine became a nomad at birth, moving from place to place across the country for most of her childhood, before finally settling in the Chicago suburbs.

<h3>THE SHOW</h3>
<p>Every single person has one thing in common: we’re all gonna die.</p>
<p>But when? How? Will it be horrific? Will it be funny? Most importantly, will it be entertaining?</p>
<p>""20 Seconds to Live"" is the anthology web-series that dares to ask and answer those questions. Every episode features a different storyline and cast of characters. At some point, a 20-second timer appears on screen and begins counting down. When it gets to zero, someone dies! Who gets it and how is most of the fun. </p>

<p>We shot and released our first eight episodes, completely financing them out of our own pockets and pulling whatever favors we could. Filmmaker Adam Green (the ""Hatchet"" movies) released our show on his website Ariescope.com free and uncensored for anyone to enjoy. Other free places to see our show include Facebook and Seeka.tv. We've also screened at nearly 20 film and web festivals all over the world and have won a few awards including:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Best Web Series – Nashville International Film Festival</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror – Berlin Web Fest</p>

<h3>WHAT WE NEED </h3>
<p>Our first season was made for almost no money. Whatever we had paid for food, fake blood, and an evil doll or two. Locations were mostly donated and just about everyone worked for free. Our friends were most gracious in providing resources to us, but it’s time to start paying people, even if it’s terribly. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496710118/egot8eey8oblybv6pknm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our producer Cat has crunched the numbers, and it's going to take $10,000 to make a 3-episode season. That seems like a lot, but that’s probably the snack budget for one day on a Transformers movie. If we raise less than our goal, we’ll put all of that money into one or two great episodes. If we raise more than our goal, we’ll make more episodes.</p>
<p>This isn't about anyone getting rich, this is about making cool stuff for fans who love their horror with a good dose of humor. If that's not you, then you're on the wrong Indiegogo page and you should hit the back button on your computer. Unless you just like helping strangers, then by all means, stick around!</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","THE SHOW
Every single person has one thing in common: we’re all gonna die.
But when? How? Will it be horrific? Will it be funny? Most importantly, will it be entertaining?
""20 Seconds to Live"" is the anthology web-series that dares to ask and answer those questions. Every episode features a different storyline and cast of characters. At some point, a 20-second timer appears on screen and begins counting down. When it gets to zero, someone dies! Who gets it and how is most of the fun. 

We shot and released our first eight episodes, completely financing them out of our own pockets and pulling whatever favors we could. Filmmaker Adam Green (the ""Hatchet"" movies) released our show on his website Ariescope.com free and uncensored for anyone to enjoy. Other free places to see our show include Facebook and Seeka.tv. We've also screened at nearly 20 film and web festivals all over the world and have won a few awards including:
Best Web Series – Nashville International Film Festival
Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror – Berlin Web Fest
Special Festival Award – Raindance Film Festival (London)
Best Horror – Hollyweb Festival

WHAT WE NEED 
Our first season was made for almost no money. Whatever we had paid for food, fake blood, and an evil doll or two. Locations were mostly donated and just about everyone worked for free. Our friends were most gracious in providing resources to us, but it’s time to start paying people, even if it’s terribly. 

Our producer Cat has crunched the numbers, and it's going to take $10,000 to make a 3-episode season. That seems like a lot, but that’s probably the snack budget for one day on a Transformers movie. If we raise less than our goal, we’ll put all of that money into one or two great episodes. If we raise more than our goal, we’ll make more episodes.
This isn't about anyone getting rich, this is about making cool stuff for fans who love their horror with a good dose of humor. If that's not you, then you're on the wrong Indiegogo page and you should hit the back button on your computer. Unless you just like helping strangers, then by all means, stick around!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i><strong>My name is Hannah Rad and I'm inviting you to be a part of ""Sorry to Keep You Waiting"", a short series I'm developing as I take a solo road trip through California. 7 locations; 7 stories and experiences vital to my mental health journey. </strong></i></p>
<p>Contributors (that's you!) fund ideas (like this one) that they can be passionate about and to people (that's me!) they trust. Here's some more info:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm Hannah Rad, a Los Angeles-based TV / radio host, DJ and content creator with on-air and production credits spanning 10+ years.</li>
<li>Where have you seen me / my work? Revolt TV, MTV, E!, ESPN, X Games, Red Bull TV, Twitch, LiveXLive, YouTube, SiriusXM, etc...</li>
<li>After moving to LA 2+ years ago, everything kinda came to a crashing halt, resulting in some really dark days, weeks, months... and a spiral of active anxiety that prohibited me from actually producing anything I deemed valuable. Sure I'd pop up on a project or show every now and again and strategically post social content looking like I was ""killing it"". In reality, those moments attributed to 5% of my time. The rest? I was lost. </li>
<li>So what will you, as contributors, help me achieve? ""Sorry to Keep You Waiting"" is a self-love letter; a short series that helps me demolish the brick walls in my path, by sharing an authentically vulnerable story / experience on a solo adventure throughout the state of California, etc... with a dual aim: (1) produce something I'm proud of and (2) rediscover myself by sharing more. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding will be attributed to production and promo of this project... of which I'm producing, shooting, editing and launching this on my own.</li>
<li>Gas: there's lots of driving. Let's fill up that tank!</li>
<li>Food: this will operate as a proper production with expenses. We're gonna order me some meals on the official budget.</li>
<li>Accommodation: some days of shooting will require overnight stay</li>
<li>Shooting / Editing: Well, that's time... and time is money. Pocket change is nice.</li>
<li>Equipment: I'm shooting with a Canon 5D Mark IV and an iPhone. But to take this to the next level, I'll use funds to purchase a second camera and accessories.</li>
<li>Promo / Social: development of all social channels as well as paid promo to help boost the project.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Perks: basic rule in life... gotta give to receive. You'll get something fun :)</span></li></ul>

What I Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:

Funding will be attributed to production and promo of this project... of which I'm producing, shooting, editing and launching this on my own.
Gas: there's lots of driving. Let's fill up that tank!
Food: this will operate as a proper production with expenses. We're gonna order me some meals on the official budget.
Accommodation: some days of shooting will require overnight stay
Shooting / Editing: Well, that's time... and time is money. Pocket change is nice.
Equipment: I'm shooting with a Canon 5D Mark IV and an iPhone. But to take this to the next level, I'll use funds to purchase a second camera and accessories.
Promo / Social: development of all social channels as well as paid promo to help boost the project.

 
Perks: basic rule in life... gotta give to receive. You'll get something fun :)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi my name is Cassidy and I am an actor who graduated college and moved to the west coast to follow my dreams. A walking cliche- I know. But what I didn’t know was how HARD it was going to be to move to a new city, on my own, for the first time, and be an adult. I didn’t know how to bargain for an apartment, or what to look for in a new mattress, or how to meet neighbors who aren’t living in a college dorm, or how to pay taxes (I still don’t know that one), or how to balance having a 40-hour a week job and a social life and a creative life and and and…. you get my point.</p> <p>BUT something I noticed along the way was that every time I told one of my “Adulting” stories they were extremely relatable. So many people I know had been through what I was going through and knew the feeling all too well. Which got me thinking about this term “Adulting.” It’s something we all attempt to do- to be real people, get real jobs, have a real life, and do what we were meant to do. But sometimes this “Adulting” thing is just so damn hard. Sometimes you’re having a great day, blasting music in your car, avoiding traffic, and getting to work EARLY. And sometimes you arrive late to work with a giant coffee stain on your shirt because you were trying to do two things at once.</p>
<p><br/>It happens to all of us. And that's the motivation/inspiration behind this web series. And that's what I want to share with you all. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Season 1 of Adulting consists of 5 episodes. I was able to film the first episode with a lovely crew of people who were willing to work for copy/credit/meals, and everything else came out of my pocket. The filming of the first episode went really smoothly,  but unfortunately it is not something that the group of us can financially continue to do for free/with funding from my bank account. So that’s why we’re coming here.</p> <p>We have 4 more episodes to film, each episode taking 2-3 days to film it. I already have a crew ready to go, I just need the money to make it all happen.</p> <p>The money we are raising goes strictly to paying the crew, paying for equipment, paying for locations, and paying for meals on set. I also budgeted some money aside for distribution, as I plan to submit the web series to as many festivals as I can to get as many eyes on the project as possible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is something we can all relate to, and I think now more than ever our world (and our country) could use a little more humor, and a little more reminders about how similar we all are to one another. By contributing to this project, you will be helping us continue to do what we love- tell stories.  Stories can change people, stories can bond people together, stories can open people's minds, and it is so important that we tell them, and keep telling them. We just need your help. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only challenges we've had so far are financially. I have been able to book locations and gather a cast/crew without too much difficulty. So I don't anticipate facing any challenges that we can't overcome. We are a resourceful and hardworking group of people who are determined to make this happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, we get it. Times are tough- that's why we made this campaign in the first place. BUT if you could share this campaign on your social media, tell a friend about it, follow us on social media (@adultingwebseries) that would all help us get the word out about our project and get as many contributions/supporters as possible! Without you, we can't make this happen.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading this and for your interest and support. It means so much to each and every one of us!!</p>

</div></div>","Natural Hair Matters...
Hi, I'm Natasha Gaspard, Brooklyn native, daughter of proud Haitian parents, Emmy Award-winning television producer, Naturalista and Founder/CEO of Mane Moves Media, Inc.  I've been producing content for television, the web and live events for over 10 years and I'm so excited to share this project with you!
My passion is creating a space where Black beauty matters and that is why I created Mane Moves Media.  MMM is a natural hair and beauty-focused video network featuring lifestyle content for women of color!  This July 21st our programming will include a live online broadcast of CURLFEST, the largest natural hair and beauty festival in NYC!  Last year, we were the first media company to offer live coverage of CURLFEST and over 30K people from all over the world tuned in to see Black beauty celebrated!  This year, we are looking to cover this amazing festival again and we will need your help in making that happen!  
What is CURLFEST?
CURLFEST is the ultimate celebration of natural beauty created by a group of dynamic women who call themselves the Curly Girl Collective!  The event is an opportunity for women of color to connect, see live demos, learn about hair products, engage in chats, shop, play games, dance and to see their beauty reflected. 
What is CURLFEST Live 2018?

The live 2 hour show that will produced by Mane Moves Media and streamed on Youtube from CURLFEST.  Viewers will be able to log on to our website and watch our live show featuring everything the festival has to offer along with live interviews, product demos and aerial footage of the Prospect Park.  Watch what we did last year. 

 
We're Bringing It For CURLFEST Live 2018! 

Our live coverage will begin with an all-access backstage pass to the VIP suite where we will interview, on the purple carpet, all of the major beauty bloggers and influencers that will be in attendance!

The Curl Patrol with MsHairandHumor is back!  We're bringing you all of the hottest hairstyles and street style fashion on the scene with the attendees who came to slay! She will also be giving away some goodies to those who can answer her tough trivia questions.

CurlyCam is a new feature we're adding to the show! This is where attendees of the festival will capture 360 views of their hairstyles for viewers to vote on!

Hair Styling Contest- during the live show we are featuring 3 of the hottest natural hair stylists to compete for 'Best Curlfest Hairstyle'!  Viewers will get to see the hairstyling in progress during the live show and vote for their favorite style at the end of the show!  Celebrity 

Live Segments- so much excitement happens on our live set!  Our amazing hosts will be interviewing all of the movers and shakers of the natural hair industry, celebrities and the product sponsors you all know and love!   

Live Drone footage- CURLFEST boasted over 25K attendees last year...this is definitely a festival that will not disappoint and we will be securing all angles for you to see all that's going down!

<h2>Welcome to MaudeWorld!</h2>
<p>Hail and well met friends, and welcome to MaudeWorld!</p>
<p>My name is Alex Maude, I am an actor, voice actor and dungeon master for the ever popular 5th edition of the worldwide phenomenon that is Dungeons and Dragons!</p>
<p>We are raising money for a new D&amp;D YouTube show: MaudeWorld (the name wasn't my idea). Emulating the likes of the brilliant Critical Role and High Rollers, we are a group of friends and creatives who want to bring you epic fantasy story telling with high production values.</p>
<p>Your generous contributions will allow us to invest in better equipment and software; as well as  hiring the artists and composers we need to improve our current production values.</p>
<h2>Our Pilot Episode!</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Want to just dive straight into the action? Check out our Pilot Episode right here! This is MaudeWorld in its current state:<br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3OdjANga50"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3OdjANga50</a></p>
<h3>Our Budget.</h3>
<p>To make the version of MaudeWorld that we really want to make we need £4000.</p>
<p>This is our approximate budget:</p>
<p>Cameras: £1,100</p>
<p>Camera Accoutrements (SD cards, tripods etc): £200</p>
<p>Microphones: £500</p>
<p>Lighting: £750</p>
<p>Software: £500</p>
<p>Artist and Composer Fees: £650</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Expenses (inc Crowdfunding Fees):  £300</p>
<p>Total Cost: £4,000</p>
<h3>Your Perks.</h3>
<p>D&amp;D is, at its heart, an awesome rule set to facilitate imagination and storytelling. And we feel that the best perks we can offer our viewers are ones that allow them to make their mark on an awesome story.</p>
<p>As such many of our perk tiers will allow you to make your mark on MaudeWorld! From giving a name to an NPC to creating a quest line with the DM; or even making a guest appearance! See our perks list for greater details.</p>
<p>Also, anyone who donates at least £5 to our story will receive an exclusive one shot that we will film after the campaign proper has commenced as our way of saying thank you to all those of you who help make MaudeWorld the reality we want it to be!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why MaudeWorld?</h3>
<p>I told you! The name wasn't my idea! Oh wait... you mean why should you watch the show?</p>
<p>Well several things: First is our creative pedigree. Our group of friends contains professional actors, writers, game developers, improvisers and more. All of us are excellent role players and we feel these skills help create a highly enjoyable and watchable show.</p>
<p>We also aim to provide a show with episodes that are shorter on average than other popular shows of the same type (about 2 hours in length). This is aimed at both people who want more high quality D&amp;D shows to watch (something I often see a call for online); and at those who simply don't have the time to commit to a solid 4 hour block of D&amp;D content, much as they would like to.</p>
<p>Our commitment to production values is another reason. This is one of the main reasons we are running this campaign in the first place: To improve and polish our current set up to make something even more enjoyable to watch!</p>
<h3>Our Commitment to You.</h3>
<p>We understand the risks associated with crowdfunding, especially with flexible campaigns like this one. But, as with all creatives, we are driven, truly, maddeningly, deeply driven by our passion.</p>
<p>As such, we will continue to make MaudeWorld even in the unfortunate instance that this crowdfund is unsuccessful, because, quite simply: We love D&amp;D and we want to share our stories with you all, even if they don't meet our high production standards.</p>
<p>Speaking personally as a DM, this is a world I have been wanting to share with people for a long time and I have been excited about the prospect of creating this show for many many months. I have been inspired by so many other great DMs and D&amp;D shows out there and what good is a wonderful idea if you don't share it with as many people as you can, right?  </p>
<h3>Spread the Word!</h3>
<p>Passion is all well and good, but we wouldn't be making a show and running a crowdfund campaign if we didn't want people to watch it!</p>
<p>So please, follow us on social media and here on IndieGoGo for more updates about the show and the campaign. Help spread the word and tell your friends and ask them to give just a few minutes of their time to check us out. The success of campaigns like this is dependant on word of mouth so please spread this as far and wide as you can. You never know who might be interested and every donation helps!</p>

<h3>What is Twenty?</h3>
<p>My name is Lily Richards and I am the writer, director, and star of Twenty The Webseries. I created Twenty to open a doorway for comedies that are relatable to everyone while highlighting the experience of LGBT women in today’s world.</p>
<p>By donating to Twenty you are allowing us to create a much anticipated Season 2. This project has been such a light in the lives of the whole creative team, the cast, the crew, as well as so many viewers who were able to relate to and find comfort in the show. By donating to Twenty, you are helping to change the narrative of LGBT women in film and television by showing that shows like Twenty deserve to be seen! </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h2><strong>The Team</strong></h2>
<p>Lily Richards (22 years old) an Caitlin Combe (23 years old) met in Boston, MA. They graduated from Emerson College in 2016 and moved to Los Angeles. They have been dating for over 3 years and this is their first collaboration. Driven by two young women, Twenty has attracted a large number of other strong women to join the team both in front and behind the camera. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>In order for Season 2 to happen we need to raise <strong>$20,000</strong>. </p>
<p>Season 1 was funded entirely out of pocket by the director/writer and producer. Although we would love to be able to do that for Season 2, it is not financially possible. The allocation of the $20,000 is simple. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$4,000: Updating our equipment. </strong>With new equipment we would be able to make Season 2 look, sound, and run even better than Season 1. </li>
<li>
<strong>$5,000: Food and Beverage.</strong> We provide our cast and crew with breakfast, lunch, and dinner when they are on set with us. We will probably shoot 18 to 20 full days to complete Season 2 which breaks down to around 50 to 60 meals. We’ve got a lot of mouths to feed! </li>
<li>
<strong>$2,000: Marketing. </strong>The most important part is getting Twenty out into the world. $2,000 for marketing would allow us to cover the cost of submit twenty to film festivals as well as the cost of buying business cards and other advertising items so that we can show twenty to as many people as possible. </li>
<li>
<strong>$4,000: Cast and Crew Expenses. </strong>One of the most magical parts of Season 1 was that everybody involved worked for free. If we managed to raise $4,000 dollars we would be able to pay our cast a minimal stipend to show how much we appreciate their hours of hard work.</li>
<li>
<strong>$5,000: Locations, Props, Gas, and Accidentals. </strong>You never know what's going to come up on set, and since we film in Los Angeles (where parking is ridiculous) we want to make sure we are covered for any potential problems or challenges we may run into along the way. </li>

<h3>Why now?</h3>
<p>As a 22-year-old proud member of the LGBT community, I wish that something similar to Twenty had been available to me when I was growing up. Societal expectations for female sexuality are often dictated through a male dominated perspective. Young female sexuality is almost always talked about in relation to men, and in many ways men are expected to find your sexuality for you. This narrative is harmful to young men and women regardless of sexuality, but for queer women it can often be detrimental to developing a true understanding of self. Discovering and owning your sexuality as a young queer woman should be exciting and empowering and I hope that Twenty can open a doorway for more media that fosters that kind of self-discovery. By donating to Twenty, you are helping to change the narrative of LGBT women in film and television. </p>

<h3>GIRL POWER IS SUPER SICK, BRUH</h3>
<p>Welcome to State University, the premiere All-American university located somewhere in the United States. This place has everything: greek life, Division I sports, five kick ass sorority sisters doubling as a masked crime fighting unit keeping the campus safe from evil, a Chipotle. But when one of their sisters is murdered at the hands of a new villain who calls himself “The Douche,” the stability of the sisterhood, the college, and the entirety of America are put into jeopardy. Part Buffy the Vampire Slayer, part Scream Queens, Kappa Force is the antidote to these trying times.</p>
<h3>WELCOME TO THE PAGE Y'ALL</h3>
<p>Hello there! And welcome to the crowdfunding page for KAPPA FORCE, a new web-series written and created by ME, Addison Heimann, and directed by the dope AF Hannah Welever. It's also produced by me and some chick named Emilie Modaff who is fine, I guess (nah she fire). We're millennials, can't you tell by our ephemeral vernacular!??!?</p>
<p>But seriously, thank you for coming here. If you're here that means you maybe kind of like who I am as a person. Or maybe you just wanted to see if anyone would donate to something as CRAZY as a superhero web-series. My hope is yes, because, let's be honest, don't you want to see a group of badass women beat the crap out of men's rights activists? Personally that's always been a dream of mine.</p>
<h3>WHAT ARE WE DOING?</h3>
<p>We're creating a seven-part web series telling this serialized story. It's weird, it's campy, it gets a little dark, but at the end of the day good WILL prevail over evil. Or WILL IT (no spoilers!!!!).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a web-series costs money! And that's where you come in. If this kind of project sounds interesting and you want to see more, we would really appreciate a donation, no matter how big or small. From renting a super hot and sexy camera, to paying everyone for their generous work on this project--your contribution will get us that much closer to bringing the story of Kappa Force to life . I love this story and the characters and cannot wait to show you the rest of what we have in store.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey! I'm Bonnie White, I've been an actor in New York for the last 7 years and I've been writing for the last two. As an actor, I mostly work on new plays in the downtown off broadway scene and I've always wanted to be a series regular on a tv show, so I decided to take my future into my own hands and write one myself! Helping me reach my goal could be a game changer in terms of my career growth and artistic growth. Think of all the tv shows that started off as a mere web series, what if I was able to reach that far with the amount you contribute today?</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to raise $4,500 in order to make these first 3 episodes. All of that will go directly into the production of the show. With your help we will be able to create a beautiful professional looking series. Your money will pay for us to have:</p>
<p>a Director, an Editor, a crew, a shooting location, props, great equipment like a camera, mics and lights, sound editing and mixing, post production editing and not to mention food to feed our actors so they have the stamina to shoot all day :)</p>
<p>Plus, depending on the size of your contribution, it could get you a ticket to the screening party in July! </p>
<p>If we don't reach the entire goal, the rest will be coming out of my pocket, so help a sista out lol</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is important because it tells a female centric story. When was the last time you watched a tv show with only female series regulars? I imagine the answer is NEVER.</p>
<p>I've worked with Michael Mullen whose production company Blackbox Productions I'm using for this project. It was Michael who filmed my short video <u><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTakDBEt5m0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cookie Love Sick</a></u> so I know and trust his work. So far that video has a few over 1,000 views on YouTube which is low for YouTube standards, but I've never performed in a 1,000 seat theater sooo pretty cool! </p>
<p>The actors I cast in the series are people I know and trust because I've worked with them before, wether at The Flea Theater or Indiana University, they are all working New York actors excited to work on a project like this. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'm not going to lie, I've never done this before. There is no guarantee that everything will go perfectly, but I'm someone who has learned how to roll with the punches and make necessary changes to reach my goal on the fly. I did make it to Advanced Level Study at UCB Improv after all! Even if this series doesn't get accepted into any festivals or catch the eye of tastemakers online, it will be instrumental to my growth as an actor and writer in terms of confidence and know-how so I'm better equipped for the next story that calls out to me that it's ready to be told. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute money, I understand! I know what it's like to skip lunch because you don't have $9 in your bank account for a Chipotle burrito, but despite that you can still help me!</p>
<ul>
<li>Make some noise about my campaign on Facebook, Instagram and/or Twitter, post the campaign page with a line about why they should contribute and the hashtag #adminswebseries</li>
<li>The Indiegogo share tools are also really easy to use!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you SO much for all of your support and kind words already, I can't wait to share this project with everyone!</p>

If you can't contribute money, I understand! I know what it's like to skip lunch because you don't have $9 in your bank account for a Chipotle burrito, but despite that you can still help me!

Make some noise about my campaign on Facebook, Instagram and/or Twitter, post the campaign page with a line about why they should contribute and the hashtag #adminswebseries
The Indiegogo share tools are also really easy to use!

Thank you SO much for all of your support and kind words already, I can't wait to share this project with everyone!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Tricia Messeroux and Gerard Brogdon have been friends for close to thirty years, sharing many life experiences and great times! Over the past year staying connected was important, but it was also a challenge. They thought that inviting a small group of friends to have monthly dinner parties rotated among each of their homes might ease some of the anxiety caused by the pandemic – the four couples agreed. After a couple of rotations, Tricia realized that dinner at three of the homes was always prepared by the wives, but dinner at the fourth home was prepared by the man of the house. What's more is that he always blew it out of the park! The food was incredible in terms of both taste and presentation.</p>
<p>Tricia, a creative director and CEO of TMezz Production, approached Gerard, a self- taught culinary artist (among other things) to do a cooking show; not to teach the wives to cook, but the MEN... the idea for Foods &amp; Dudes was born!!!</p>
<p>Ten episodes were produced for the first season. The show was so well received that Tricia had the opportunity to meet with influential network and streaming executives who asked for a second season that must be produced within very specific (and expensive) technical parameters. The second season will also have a far heavier focus on the “barber shop talk” aspect of the show, leaning heavily into issues that affect men in our society. Another goal for the second season is for the show to be filmed in a new “open concept” kitchen that will make it easier for the viewers to see the food being prepared, and hear the conversations that take place. The challenge is that we must complete 8- 10 episodes by November 1, 2021 and launch by December 1, 2021.</p>
<p>This is a show that empowers men to do something that hasn’t traditionally been recognized as a man's activity in the home. Merging conversations about men's insights on sports, family, current events and other topics with a cooking lesson to make a delicious meal for their loved ones makes this show unique. These Dudes are well informed and aren't afraid to share their opinions! The viewers will continue to laugh,</p>

<p>- FILMED IN A NEW KITCHEN!!!!</p>
<p>- PURCHASE INDUSTRY REQUIRED EQUIPMENT $$</p>
<p>- TECH SPECS</p>

<p>- $5000 (Name listed on website, Foods &amp; Dudes T-Shirt, three free tickets to premier party, Foods &amp; Dudes seasoning rub PLUS a 2-3 minute walk-on role on an episode)</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>This show is not only fun and informative, but it’s also important. Families have gotten away from sitting down at the dinner table for a number of reasons, and that’s where some of the “good stuff” can happen. Couples that are reluctant or unable to go to restaurants can have restaurant quality meals prepared and served at home. The topics of discussion will be relatable and debatable, perhaps even bringing attention to issues that aren’t discussed on any other platform – and certainly not while learning to prepare delicious, mouth-watering meals.</p>
<p>Challenges</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge is that the industry requires such incredible specifications when it comes to the finished product in order to be considered for broadcasting or<br/>streaming. Most of these specs require us to purchase additional equipment and hire personnel who are proficient with the use of the equipment.</p>

<p>Our Culinary Artist Gerard (who everyone calls “G”) is a self-taught cook and baker. Growing up, he watched his mother and father prepare traditional Southern dishes and began cooking on his own while in his early teen years. While he learned his basic skills from his parents, he is gifted in being able to recreate dishes just by taste, infuse new and bold flavors to traditional recipes, and create his own style of cooking that uses aggressive flavor combinations. Gerard believes that cooking at home is the starting point for healthy eating, important family discussions, romantic evenings, fantastic family gatherings and so many other events that revolve around good food, drinks, and desserts. His goal is to have men step out of their comfort zone and enter the kitchen - and to teach them to do so skillfully. His catch-phrase in the kitchen is “The first bite we take is with our eyes”, and his hope is that others who watch him will take their own “bite” at cooking because he makes it look so easy and fun!</p>

<p>My name is Tikal De Meru aka Onyx, I've written this very special web series for Youtube and I'll be your host! ​The show is about people that have had a <strong>mystical experience</strong> and have done something about it. This project will highlight businesses, inventions, teachings, discoveries, modalities and practices that will, that can or that have already impacted the face of the earth. I personally call these people legends and mystics!</p>
<p>You'll see very personal dreams and visions that have inspired the world or are about to come to life. You'll hear some wicked tracks and specially crafted music composed exclusively for the show! plus you'll get to see some cool cartoon illustrations that will take us in the inexplicable cathartic moments the story tellers share. It will be short 'n sweet, bold and weird, and all kinds of cats, but mostly with inspiring people facing the unknown and  diving deep to look within.</p>

<p>With this project, not only will we inspire to take a new look on reality but we can also protect the realms of magic, <strong>imagination and creativity</strong> for our future generations. 'Imagination' - some say, is the foundation of the human existence.<br/><br/><i><strong>With today's mega entertainment industry</strong></i> and towering tech growth, some of us must keep finding creative ways to give voice to the dream keepers, the artists, the muses, and the guardians of ancient wisdom, especially the <i>inner technology</i> that is not only valid and prominent in great human advances but in our daily lives. Witnessing the supreme and relentless creative force behind all human beings going through any type of setback can shed much light to those stuck in the dark. We hope the stories told in this show will help those that may be finding themselves riddled with fear or doubt, pain or sorrow, shame or guilt, and give them a potent push towards an exalted life.<br/><br/><i><strong>The value is endless...</strong></i> <br/>We hope to demystify the concept of mysticism, in Asia for example, the word mystic is surrounded by the stories of ghosts, demonic possessions, or horror, when some of our most ancient texts have conveyed poetic and powerful accounts of divine interventions, burning bushes, and miracles that two thousand years later are still being told of. In Western countries, it seems that ridicule and mockery tend to precede even the closest thing to a dialogue about anything mystical - which can tear apart a fragile soul or a timid kid when in some parts of the world where the unseen is embraced, people with mystical experiences are seen as <strong>gifted</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>OH! and Cats, cats n more cats! </strong>to the rescue! <br/>In case you don't notice throughout the show - We are crazy about cats! and we have a problem to solve here in Bali with cats and dogs not being loved up the way they could be, and even worse still... they are many times dumped injured into garbage or into the wild and left to die... so we want to support the local cat lovers and educational cat sanctuaries, provide emergency care to our friends in need. With our show expected to be a success, 10% of our profits will be reserved and funnelled to supporting cat helpers and creating safe haven for them. </p>

This project will highlight businesses, inventions, teachings, discoveries, modalities and practices that will, that can or that have already impacted the face of the earth. I personally call these people legends and mystics!
You'll see very personal dreams and visions that have inspired the world or are about to come to life. You'll hear some wicked tracks and specially crafted music composed exclusively for the show! plus you'll get to see some cool cartoon illustrations that will take us in the inexplicable cathartic moments the story tellers share. It will be short 'n sweet, bold and weird, and all kinds of cats, but mostly with inspiring people facing the unknown and  diving deep to look within.


 

Raising the stakes of what we believe the mind can take and inspiring others to realise that one of the most challenging journey of discovery may be in the psyche or human consciousness. We push boundaries to learn about our existence when we have not even gotten near the bottom of an ocean of emotion without drowning in the sea of questions about who we are! but man what a tremendous quest that is? 
If this elegant, funky and entertaining project can help illustrate the trials and challenges of our day-to-day wins & losses then, with your help we can create an inspiring library of the many legendary humans that have contributed to perhaps the world's greatest creation: the human experience.
And guess what, we are also taking in more applicants if you want your story told our way. Like what you see? get on board. Expect a wicked style and modern tales of the extraordinary, encounters with another kind, out of body experiences, past life regression, channeling, telepathy, premonitions, spirit guidance, symbolism, shamanism, ancestral voices, possessions, trance, healing, intuition, apparitions and so much more, but also inspiring humans.


This campaign serves in funding the basic needs for a team to keep producing high quality mini documentary series for everyone to enjoy. The team consists of Arya, Balinese film maker, Sovie our new marketing strategist and myself. Also we are needing to hire an Indonesian cartoonist. We have our very own music composer from Los Angeles.

With this I also want to honour and revive a mostly ridiculed and mis-understood ancient art of communication: the art of deep listening. I believe true knowledge is by experience and that there is something behind the veil that is speaking to us and guiding us to do what we do. Perhaps what we call reality will forever remain a notorious mystery, but how much of a sublime challenge is that for a life's mission than the famous aphorism Know Thyself ?



Here is the more quantifiable stuff; we are dialing in the production, the art direction and the concept writing and we already have a quality camera but we need an extra help which will go towards post production, crew, design, marketing, and merchandise. A Grand Total of 13,500 euros​ that will make the difference for the birth and launch of this project to reach your personal screens by February of 2021. We plan to make 44 episodes per year til 2026 and this budget will kickstart the Urban Legends channel on YouTube. ""BACK IT"" - donate to our project or get a perk of your choice!

With this project, not only will we inspire to take a new look on reality but we can also protect the realms of magic, imagination and creativity for our future generations. 'Imagination' - some say, is the foundation of the human existence.With today's mega entertainment industry and towering tech growth, some of us must keep finding creative ways to give voice to the dream keepers, the artists, the muses, and the guardians of ancient wisdom, especially the inner technology that is not only valid and prominent in great human advances but in our daily lives. Witnessing the supreme and relentless creative force behind all human beings going through any type of setback can shed much light to those stuck in the dark. We hope the stories told in this show will help those that may be finding themselves riddled with fear or doubt, pain or sorrow, shame or guilt, and give them a potent push towards an exalted life.The value is endless... We hope to demystify the concept of mysticism, in Asia for example, the word mystic is surrounded by the stories of ghosts, demonic possessions, or horror, when some of our most ancient texts have conveyed poetic and powerful accounts of divine interventions, burning bushes, and miracles that two thousand years later are still being told of. In Western countries, it seems that ridicule and mockery tend to precede even the closest thing to a dialogue about anything mystical - which can tear apart a fragile soul or a timid kid when in some parts of the world where the unseen is embraced, people with mystical experiences are seen as gifted. 
OH! and Cats, cats n more cats! to the rescue! In case you don't notice throughout the show - We are crazy about cats! and we have a problem to solve here in Bali with cats and dogs not being loved up the way they could be, and even worse still... they are many times dumped injured into garbage or into the wild and left to die... so we want to support the local cat lovers and educational cat sanctuaries, provide emergency care to our friends in need. With our show expected to be a success, 10% of our profits will be reserved and funnelled to supporting cat helpers and creating safe haven for them. 


 


Bali is very unique and seems to have a spiritual aid. Although the COVID-19 drama presents challenges that everyone in our world is facing on a daily basis, our team is working hard to ensure we can create our films while still following awareness, health guidelines and sovereignty. While these are unprecedented times, we foresee finishing production of 44 episodes for 2021 when we meet our crowdfund goal.  *Any perks affected by the pandemic will be worked out to your satisfaction.

<h3>The Story:</h3>
<p>Post Grad is an online series about a group of friends, Chris (pictured), James, Tyler, Chelsea and Malik who all deal with different aspect of life immediately Post Grad-uation. The episodes highlight each character's individual struggles adapting to this new stage of their life. </p>
<ul>
<li>Post Graduate life isn't talked about very much. We see a lot of sitcoms, even older ones with friend groups, however they're typically into their late 20's/early 30's and established. This ""Dramedy"" aims to focus on the years prior to this stability and the temporary chaos it can cause. </li>
<li>The actors are all experienced, talented, and ready to bring this project to life. It's a project that we are all passionate about and have all recently experienced. </li>
<li>This campaign is important to us as this project has been years in the making and now that it's time for shooting, we are so close to bringing this project to life for you all to see and enjoy!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Need </h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>The budget to film this series (12 Episodes), using various location shoots, along with the hiring of additional production personnel is around $7,000 (mainly because we're very resourceful and found a way to pull a lot off on our own).  This would allow us to film an entire ""season"" of the series (and possibly even more) with so many unique locations that help bring this art to life along with helping with expenses such as:<ul>
<li>Lighting</li>
<li>Lenses</li>
<li>Props</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Cinematography</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nobody wants to watch a show shot in someone's living room every episode and nobody can do a project alone. This campaign would help with both. </li>
</ul>
<h3>The Reason</h3>
<p>With your donation, Post Grad has the ability to reach a MASSIVE audience of young adults who are currently experiencing the same challenges as our characters. With this series, we hope to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relate to adults young and old, about the challenges a lot of us faced, building a sense of community amongst our viewers. </li>
<li>Give voice to not only this topic, but topics and debates that we all partake in, whether in real life or on social media. To start a conversation. </li>
<li>Entertain you! I meant it IS a dramedy for goodness sake! Yes, there is drama associated with the show topics, but this isn't the Sopranos! There are loads of lines, situations, and moments to keep you laughing!</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<ul><li>We have some amazing perks for donors! These include custom items from the show and the ""University"" our graduates attended  (t-shirts, mugs, posters, etc. all seen in the show) along with things such as a production credit, a character named in your honor, and more with of course, a thank you to be seen in the post-credit! </li></ul>

<h3>What's ""From the Ashes""?</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Marlene Thompson, a Second City-trained improviser and comedian living here in Asheville. Over the past few months, I've been working with a group of writers, actors and video production pros to make plans for a show I have wanted to do for a long time.</p>
<p>It's called ""From the Ashes,"" and it's a political comedy and commentary show hosted by me. There'll be an opening monologue, segments from a desk, filmed sketches and on-the-street segments. If you've seen John Oliver or Samantha Bee's shows, you know the format, but this show adds in a local, Asheville element along with the national stories.</p>
<p>There'll be a live show at the Actor's Center of Asheville in Black Mountain September 14-15, but we'll also be making videos of every segment to post to YouTube and Funny or Die.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We're looking for a little seed money to pay the crew--camera operator, sound technician, lighting coordinator, etc.--and, if we raise enough, the actors who appear in the sketches. We want to make sure they're compensated for their hard work!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You'll Get</h3>
<p>In addition to the regular segments of the show, we'll be recording a special shout-out video in which I'll thank anyone who contributes $5 or more to our efforts. If you can't contribute that much, I'll thank you personally in a tweet if you pitch in at least $1!</p>
<p>Bigger spenders can actually become part of the show! Anyone who chips in $10 or more will get a character named after them in a sketch in a future episode, and folks who are generous enough to contribute $15 or more will get their photo featured on the show during a desk segment. (Think of the John Oliver jokes where he says ""Dave keeps eating the peanut butter. Stop it, Dave!"" You'll be Dave!)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a pilot, so there's always an outside chance it's the only episode of the show, but our plan is to make this a regular thing. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Remember, Tiger King, toilet paper shortages - oh what a time to be inside. With everything going on, our producer, Alice Shy saw an opportunity to further expand the script from two episodes to six.With the green light from the writer and creator, Reece Borden, the virtual writer's room was opened. In association with the New York Film Academy One Year Producing, the 2020 spring-producing cohort filmed an early version of the pilot. You can watch the spec trailer below. 

Through her production company, Ashy Production Studios, Alice brought on fifteen interns to assist with marketing, social media, public relations, and productions. They established social accounts, managed email marketing campaigns, and creating public relations strategies.  
View Our Show's Press Kit Now, we are ready to finance this project. The individuals mentioned above have graciously donated their talents and resources to bring this project to life.  Season one of Texas & Alexis will consist of Six ten minutes episodes. It is a series about the rigor and beauty of friendship. The show pulls inspiration from Broad City. Visually, we aim for an Edgar Wright style with a campy, colorful aesthetic while building on classic comedy elements from Seinfeld to Schitt's Creek. Following production and post-production, We have the goals in mindPlan A: Land a distribution deal with online streamer such as Facebook Watch, Plan B: Run the festival circuit; Win some awards ;)Plan C: Stream exclusively on Ashy Patreon for subscribersWhat does a boss Black lady business student have in common with a bombastic queer drama major? In the case of Texas and Alexis, history. As marginalized students in college, namely at a private white institution (PWI), these childhood best friends have come from the suburbs in search of success, glamour, and fun. So far, they’ve only found the latter. The specific challenges of being Black and/or queer in a PWI can create a rift between those who experience those identities and those who don’t.Texas & Alexis examines this ravine, throwing its titular characters into situations that exaggerate, prod at, and pick apart the absurdities and hilarities of these gaps inexperience. New York City is a character itself. We see the city through the eyes of naive transplants whose only true notion of New York, comes from 90s sitcoms -- Man are they in for a rude awakening. With the help of some natives, will our characters earn their city legs or will they scamper back to the suburbs?

<h3><u>Funding:</u></h3>
<p>We plan to release Downfall regardless of the success of this campaign. But, we want to deliver the best quality stream that we can, as well as compensate everybody for their time and effort. </p>
<p>To do this, we have drafted a budget to accommodate payment for each player, as well as to commission visual assets for the stream, such as overlays and character artwork. We feel this will allow us to be more ambitious with our story and produce a more visually appealing and professional final product.</p>
<p>We are currently aiming to raise £525 for the project, which broken down, will pay for: </p>
<ul>
<li>£250: To financially compensate the cast (Split to £50 each) </li>
<li>£75: To commission an overlay from <strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/rredcloudss"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rredcloudss</a></strong>
</li>
<li>£200: To commission character artwork from <strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/evilcleverdog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Isa</a></strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any funds raised over our goal amount will go towards further financially compensating our cast.</p>
<p>We believe that with the money from this campaign goal, we can further enhance this project and deliver a dynamic story set in the world of <i>Spire</i>. We are incredibly excited to bring you <i>Downfall: A Spire Actual Play Campaign</i> very soon!</p>

More than that, Frank’s experience tends closer toward yelling about videogames on their Twitch channel, or working as a voice actor, their most known role being Basira Hussein in The Magnus Archives. Frank's pronouns are they/them.
Frank will be playing as Gyan, the Inksmith. Gyan isn’t a grumpy old man, but a cheerful young author, highly aware that stories have incredible power when told right.
 
Isa as Chroma, the Idol

Since being introduced to the TTRPG community in 2019, Isa has played in permanent and guesting roles on multiple TTRPG streams and podcasts, including No Initiative’s Quest: The Soaring City. She is also a cast member on the Asians Represent Critical Read: Al-Qadim podcast. As well as streaming TTRPGs, she is a cosplayer, artist, content creator and designer, and will be creating the character art for Downfall. Isa’s pronouns are she/her.
Isa will be playing Chroma, the Idol. Chroma is a rebellious and flamboyant street artist, who seeks to bring colour and beauty to the drab slums of Spire to inspire hope in others.
 
Nat as Z, the Azurite

A long-time TTRPG GM and player, both on and off stream, Nat is excited to play part of the crew in Downfall. They’re particularly proud to be The Guide for No Initiative’s Quest: The Soaring City, and loves enabling his co-players to energetic drama and bad decision making (in character). Nat’s also an autistic freelance writer, editor, and TTRPG game designer. Nat's pronouns are they/he.
Nat will be playing Z, the Azurite. A deal-maker and wielder of words, Z brandishes language as others would cutting blades to countervail his burdensome past mistakes.
 

Funding:
We plan to release Downfall regardless of the success of this campaign. But, we want to deliver the best quality stream that we can, as well as compensate everybody for their time and effort. 
To do this, we have drafted a budget to accommodate payment for each player, as well as to commission visual assets for the stream, such as overlays and character artwork. We feel this will allow us to be more ambitious with our story and produce a more visually appealing and professional final product.
We are currently aiming to raise £525 for the project, which broken down, will pay for: 

£250: To financially compensate the cast (Split to £50 each) 
£75: To commission an overlay from rredcloudss

£200: To commission character artwork from Isa


Any funds raised over our goal amount will go towards further financially compensating our cast.
We believe that with the money from this campaign goal, we can further enhance this project and deliver a dynamic story set in the world of Spire. We are incredibly excited to bring you Downfall: A Spire Actual Play Campaign very soon!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Story of SLEEPING ELEPHANT</h3>
<p>HEY!!</p>
<p>It's Patrick Weiers, Ryan Kilbourne, and Aaron Sharif...thank you for visiting our page! </p>
<p>We're emerging filmmakers from Toronto who have a passion for film and an ambition to make our mark on the industry. SLEEPING ELEPHANT was conceived in March of 2017 out of a need to explore the recent political divergence between Canada and America. We quickly decided that if we were going to produce a large project, it had to be unique. We conceived a found footage aesthetic which would infuse Instagram ""stories"" to add an extremely tangible aesthetic while commenting on the increasing popularity of social media content. </p>
<p>So in September of 2017 , the three of us embarked on a road trip through America and shot on real locations over 23 days. While there was a script (and we scouted locations on Google Maps), we capitalized on any interesting locations and unique people we encountered. We mixed our spontaneous improvisation with subtextual scripted conversations to create an incredibly unique aesthetic. </p>
<p>Since completing production in early October, 2017, we've been balancing our day jobs with editing the series and we've finally been able to have a picture-locked cut with our composers' music. Although we're embracing a raw and ""user-generated"" aesthetic, we need to improve the technical quality of the series in order to maximize the audience's engagement. We don't want the visual, and especially the audio quality, to distract the audience from the thematic impact of the series so we're asking you to help us make this project the best it can be! </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Breaking Down the Finance </h3>
<p>We're asking for $7,000 CAD: </p>
<ul>
<li>$2,500 CAD for Sound Edit and Sound Mix<ul>
<li>Sound Editing includes making the dialogue more audible, eliminating unwanted sounds, and adding new sound effects to create a more detailed and crisp sound to the series. </li>
<li>Sound Mixing includes balancing the levels of the dialogue, sound effects, and music to create a more dynamic sonic environment. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>$2,000 CAD for Composers<ul><li>We have connected with a pair of Composers who have worked on a variety of projects. They will help emphasize dramatic cues while complementing the emotions of the series. </li></ul>
</li>
<li>$1,500 CAD for Colour Correction<ul><li>Colour Correction is the process of making the images more dynamic by adding contrast and enriching certain colours to emphasize particular thematic tones. The stylization of the images also helps distinguish between different geographical regions along the road trip.  </li></ul>
</li>
<li>$1,000 CAD for Graphic Designer<ul><li>Our Graphic Designer will improve the realism of our multimedia aesthetic by further developing the overlays for our Instagram and Skype Sequences. They'll also create a custom font and design the subtitles and credits. </li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We've connected with some really talented collaborators, and after seeing a rough cut of our series, they've agreed to work at discounted rates. Why don't they just work for free? Well...on top of software and hardware costs, our team are professionals who do their respected jobs to pay the bills! The fees listed above are just enough to keep the lights on! Our team is passionate about independent productions and they all believe SLEEPING ELEPHANT can break through the noise and have a genuine impact on independent cinema. </p>
<p>While most campaigns have tangible perks, we decided to take a different approach and offer some services and opportunities. As emerging filmmakers, we don't have much money but we do have a developed skillset that we can offer! Two of our marquee perks are Photography and Videography Services (of your choosing) done by the filmmakers. We have plans for SLEEPING ELEPHANT to be released around the world and you have a chance to be in it! Finally, if you want to launch your career in the media industry you have a chance to become an Executive Producer. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why Do We Need The Money? </h3>
<p>Our main motivation to produce SLEEPING ELEPHANT was to make something unique and prove to the world that you don't need a million dollars to make engaging and impactful content...and we succeeded! We've gotten some great feedback from our test screenings, but in order to present the series in a more formal setting we need to make the series more technically pristine. As much as festivals and film-lovers celebrate micro-budget independent filmmaking, it's necessary to perform colour correction, sound editing, and sound mixing in order to minimize the audience's distraction by the technical shortcomings.</p>
<p>While we want to keep a raw and ""user-generated"" aesthetic, making the series more watchable will make the characters more engaging and the subtext more impactful. On top of our sound and colour collaborators, working with our composers' original music will also heighten the emotion of the series and solidify it as a genuine independent and original piece of cinema! </p>

What Are We Working Towards? 
Every production’s two enemies are TIME and MONEY.....and SLEEPING ELEPHANT is no exception. Right now we need to finance post-production and we're chasing a deadline.
It was a huge personal risk making this series. We turned down jobs, paid out of pocket, and worked thousands of hours for no immediate return. We did it because we love the medium and we’re passionate about our unique approach to filmmaking. We don't want to see our time and money go to waste and we're reaching out to you hoping that you cannot only help us achieve our goal, but be a part of a new age of independent cinema! 

 
Other Ways You Can Help! 
While we would appreciate whatever financial contribution you can make, any public or private sharing of our series would be amazing! Whether it’s sharing one of our pages with your friends or just spreading the series word-of-mouth, any type of discussion is welcomed. We’re confident that the further our series reaches, the more awareness we can bring to independent Canadian cinema!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign
