<p>Rain is a journalist and visual artist from New York City who strives to create large scale mixed media compositions with an emphasis on historical and social conflict.

<h3>Circus Kazoo </h3>
<p>Circus Kazoo is an all-ages, all-levels welcome Circus centered in Grayslake, Illinois. ""J"", Circus Kazoo's fearless leader teaches and trains a variety of circus arts skills, doing her best to accommodate a diverse body of students. Over the last two years, she has joyfully watched as the acrobatics groups at her space have blossomed from a focus on basics to a wide variety of skills and talents. There has reached a point where the community would like to train higher technical levels of tricks, as well as higher levels physically, in space. So as to accommodate the increased demands but still maintain a high standard of safety, we have determined the purchase of a spotting belt will be necessary. We are asking for your help to make our communities' dreams a reality.<br/><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need:</h3>
<p>Like any circus gear, proper safety spotting equipment can be quite pricey. Although some of the other circus arts are able to ""earn their keep"" easier, Circus Kazoo has done its best to make acrobatics affordable for all to participate. As such, the purchase of this equipment will take a very long time to be paid off via donations at Jams, or through the acrobatics classes taught each week. <br/><br/>In total, we are asking for $800 to cover the purchase and installation of the spotting belt, and all necessary equipment to set it up in a safe, sustainable manner. <br/><br/>If you wish to donate out of the spirit of community, we thank you! Donations large or small are welcome. If you actually want something for your money though, you're in luck!<br/><br/>By donating through this campaign, you can get earn private instruction from one of Circus Kazoo's highly experienced instructors, you can try out a new circus skill, or you can even bring the circus to you, by creating a custom workshop at your own studio.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We understand that not everyone can donate, so you can also help by passing this campaign along to friends and associates. Spread the word, spread the love, and come play with us and our new spotting belt, starting in January!<br/><br/> </p>

As such, the purchase of this equipment will take a very long time to be paid off via donations at Jams, or through the acrobatics classes taught each week. In total, we are asking for $800 to cover the purchase and installation of the spotting belt, and all necessary equipment to set it up in a safe, sustainable manner. If you wish to donate out of the spirit of community, we thank you! Donations large or small are welcome. If you actually want something for your money though, you're in luck!By donating through this campaign, you can get earn private instruction from one of Circus Kazoo's highly experienced instructors, you can try out a new circus skill, or you can even bring the circus to you, by creating a custom workshop at your own studio.
 
We understand that not everyone can donate, so you can also help by passing this campaign along to friends and associates. Spread the word, spread the love, and come play with us and our new spotting belt, starting in January!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</p><p>Hi.  I’m Colleen
Garibaldi, an artist living and working in Washington DC.  I’ve studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of
Fine Arts, Smithsonian Institute Studio Arts, Corcoran College of Art
Continuing Ed, UDC, Cloud Farm and Virginia Tech.  My work has been exhibited in cities such as
Washington, Philadelphia and Chicago and is in multiple private collections.  I'm immensely grateful that I will soon have the opportunity to work for 4 weeks at the <a href=""http://www.vermontstudiocenter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vermont Studio Center</a> at an amazing residency.<br/></p>
<p>For the last year I’ve been nose to the grindstone painting
my heart out to create a new body of work. 
But don’t worry – it’s a good grindstone! You see, I took a bit of a detour a number of
years ago and got lost in a career in architecture while trying to maintain my painting
practice on the side.  After years of trying
to juggle both, I finally came to the realization that this
dual existence just wasn’t working, so I took the leap, left my job (yes, the
one with the salary) and dedicated myself solely to painting.</p>
<p>I dove in wholeheartedly (hence the nose-to-the-grindstone)
fully understanding that I needed to create a body of work so that I could
start down the path to becoming a working artist.  I'm thrilled and thankful that a major step on that path is now underway with acceptance into this residency.  I’ve included some of my recent paintings here (and a few drawings for good measure) and, as you can see, I’m a figurative artist.  This work allows me to explore the language
of the body: I’m looking into reforming
objectification, investigating the role of narrative in figurative work,
examining patterns, pursuing clarity through distortion, wrestling with beauty<b>,</b> frequently endeavoring to connect
with a sense of playfulness, a lightness of being and ultimately, I hope, opening the door to a
greater understanding.</p>
<p>With your support, I can continue this exploration in
Vermont. I’ll
have the chance to work in a great studio (my basement is a little cramped and
dark but hey, its OK if I make a mess!) and, importantly, it will give me the
opportunity to work with and around other artists.  I currently work solo in my studio, and
look forward to being able to work in a communal setting to learn and grow as well as to
contribute however I can. Working in a
like-minded community will be like a breath of fresh air – and I plan on taking
many big, deep breaths! The Vermont
Studio Center also gives me the opportunity to work from live models and attend
lectures.  This is why I’ve been
turning cartwheels!  </p>
<p>And
so I am asking for your help to make this feasible.  Your generosity will help me defray the costs
beyond the grant and work exchange of my program – funds raised will go to pay
the remaining residency fees, travel costs, supplies,  photographing and
shipping/transporting completed work.</p>
<p>Thank
you from the bottom of my heart for helping this old dog take her work to the next
level.  Watch out Vermont, here I come!!  </p>

<h3>What is Sebastian?</h3>
<p><em>Sebastian </em>is a unique larger-than-life steel statue of the model Sebastian Sauvé. Taking its main inspirations from the myth of Narcissus<em>, </em>Charles Ray’s<em><em> <em>Boy with Frog </em></em></em>and<em> </em>the Greco-Roman depictions of the youth Antinous, this project is both an exploration of contemporary representations of the masculine form and a comment on the icon and its place in contemporary culture. Alongside the finished stainless steel statue, which will stand over 8 feet tall, a number of smaller identical limited edition versions are being produced. Once complete, the full-size statue will be exhibited internationally before finding a permanent home. The image below shows you what the finished statue will look like.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Thanks to a handful of investors (really, thank you!), we've already done the first part of the project, the 3D scanning, modelling and printing/casting, and now we need to raise funds to complete the full-size statue for exhibition. In order to do that we're offering identical smaller limited edition versions of <em>Sebastian</em> as perks for your contribution. There's a 6 inch (15 cm) version cast in stone resin (in an edition of 50) and a 20 inch (50 cm) version cast in bronze (in an edition of 15). There's also a poster and a vest/tank top featuring the statue and some other cool stuff too, including the chance to meet the model and attend the invitation only private view in London, check out the pics below and info on the right. From the tests we've done so far we think the limited edition statues look amazing and hope you do too.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This statue will be around forever. Well, maybe not forever but for a long, long time. Given the nature of stainless steel it'll last for hundreds and hundreds of years and we hope that in the future it will become as important a work as those that have inspired it. This type of work is something that comes along once in a lifetime and we want you to be a part of making it happen.</p>

<h3>About Sebastian Sauvé</h3>
<p>American-born and British-raised Sebastian Sauvé is ranked amongst the 50 top male models in the world. His boyish yet masculine appearance coupled with a classical look is ideal for a project that not only takes its inspiration from classical sculpture but also reflects the definition of male beauty in the 21st Century.</p>

Given the nature of stainless steel it'll last for hundreds and hundreds of years and we hope that in the future it will become as important a work as those that have inspired it. This type of work is something that comes along once in a lifetime and we want you to be a part of making it happen.

<h3>I've been bringing the Soul Train to Burning Man since 2008.  I have never asked for help, I funded it myself, I maitain it myself every year.... but this year it pains me to say, this time I need help.</h3>
<p>I took it to a mechanic, as I do every year to get it checked out... and I got some horrible news:  It needs engine and transmission work, and some electrical work.  They estimate it will cost around $3,000.  And this is not an inflated estimate, the shop I took it to is Burner friendly.</p>
<p>To be honest, I can't stand asking for money, I was considering simply not going to the Burn this year.  But I had too many friends convince me that I should at least put it out to the community before making that decision.  So here we are.... either I raise the money, or the Soul Train isn't coming.  Either way.... thank you for reading.</p>

<p>Caocao is one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period (AD 220-280). He is well-known of his military and political leadership as well as his heroic courage and manner. Caocao was born in Bozhou, and here is caocao’s experimental ground for his political and military theories. In Bozhou, Caocao had built the oldest and the most complex underground military tunnel in China. In the Cao’s Park, the domes of Caocao’s relatives, such as his grandfather, father and his eldest daughter, can be found. </p>
<p><img alt=""why2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/IhhAwkH.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p>As an ancient city, there are many historical sites and ancient architectures in Bozhou, and many of them are still good in condition. Among all the sites in Bozhou, <strong>Huaqilou</strong> (Blossom opera house) is the main venue of the festival. Drama performance and exhibition will be held at here.<img alt=""hxl"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/KFVyFZr.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""hxl""/></p>
<p>Huaqilou is built in 1976, during the rule of Kangxi emperor in Qing dynasty. It is a building designed for watching Chinese opera, and its name refers to the colourful paintings and vivid cravings on the blue brick walls which are less than 5 cm thick. It is recognized as a “Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level” by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage in 1988.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/OkZ07a4.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/><br/>Another heritage highlight is the <strong>Bozhou Ancient Tunnel</strong>. It is an ancient underground military tunnel built by Caocao, with its function to move his troops secretly from place to place without getting notice by his enemy. The 4 km long underground tunnel has a very complicated structure. The tunnel was constructed in a crisscross pattern and different kinds of traps were also designed to avoid enemy sneaking into the tunnel. In the ‘Records of the Three Kingdoms’, a Chinese historical text published in 3<sup>rd</sup> century, also mentioned how Caocao won the battles with the aid of this underground tunnel. </p>

 this exchange exhibition project we want to create a vibrant dialog 
between two cities; Edinburgh and Reykjavik. We have come to see that 
there is no current artistic link between these two cities and we 
believe that it would make an interesting exchange in dialogue in the 
field of visual art, to open a link for discussion & interaction and
 possibly some collaborative work in the near future.The exhibition should represent contemporary art today in Reykjavik and Edinburgh.The
 Old Ambulance Depot has offered five Icelandic artists an opportunity 
 to be exhibited now in September 2011. The opening of the exhibition is

<img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://amandamakepeace.com/art/media/ebsq/aceopack1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>Our Story</h3>
<p>I am a struggling artist living in the beautiful countryside of Oconee County, Georgia. Unlike many artists who have a second income, I have none due to numerous health problems. I spend most of my time at home, creating my art, looking after my teenage daughter, and trying to keep my health in check. I have zero income and make very little from my art in this economy. But that's okay. All I want is to be able to keep creating my art.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have a huge collection of blank Artist Trading Cards (like the pack shown right). With your subscription I will send you 1 Art Card a month for an entire year! This will be an original watercolor painting, measuring 2.5 x 3.5 inches. It will come housed in a clear, protective sleeve. A 1 year subscription costs only $20.00.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Once you subscription begins you can expect to receive the first art card in about a week (US Subscribers), included will be your coupon code for Etsy. International subscribers should expect their art card in approx. 10-14 days.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your subscription I will be able to buy new supplies and tools I desperately need and have no way of buying in the immediate future. It will mean I can keep creating and sharing my art<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $800.00. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>1. My laptop is not doing as well as it once did. I use my laptop for editing photos of artwork, selling online at Etsy, and even creating digital art. If I lose my laptop, I lose my lifeline. I want to buy a refurbished laptop for $390.00.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>2. The camera that I photograph my artwork with has begun to flip out on me. I spend hours trying to get a good picture. I want to buy a new camera for $200.00</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>3. I would like to spend $150.00 to help stock up on art supplies--paints, a real easel, new brushes (not the cheap ones that fall apart after a couple weeks), etc.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>4. The remainder I'd like to invest in my Etsy Shop, <a href=""http://naturescharms.etsy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Nature's Charms</a>. I want to transform it into a business, a successful selling shop.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If I only make part of my goal I'll use some of it for art supplies and put the rest in savings for a laptop. I must have the laptop if I want to continue selling online.<br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>I plan on taking a 40 day art road trip throughout the United States with Nik Martinez, a professional photographer I have worked with several times. We’ve decided on stopping in about 15 cities in 15 states for pop up art shows and live paintings. Along the way, we will also be visiting children's hospitals and other interested institutions to offer either a free mural or to paint with children. I would like to brighten up everyday life and give back something that has given me everything. I believe this project will influence and engage young minds. I also believe that this project will encourage communities to continue to support events like these.</p>
<p>With the help of friends and sponsors this can all come true. We will need sufficient funding for 40 days of travel. All donations will go directly to helping us on our journey. With each contribution there will be a nice perk in return. Depending on the amount donated you will receive an item from the following: original art print, original framed pen &amp; ink drawing, original medium sized painting or an original large scale painting/3D cutout painting.

In 2001 I was first diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). I didn't pay attention because the doctor said, ""it will be years before you have anything to worry about."" In fact I'd forgotten about it. Nine years later I changed eye doctors and this doctor was horrified that I was doing nothing for my AMD. He sent me to a retina specialist and she mapped my eyes. The macula in both eyes showed drusen, but being the dry type, she could do nothing. I told my mother and son about it. Mother began to cry. My son held her tight putting everything in perspective by saying, ""Amah, it's her sight, not her mind.""</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">Eventually I found </span><a href=""http://www.amd.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;"">AMD.org</span></a><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">,  Macular Degeneration Partnership, and discovered several things I could do to help slow the progress of AMD. I signed up for their newsleter to keep abreast of research and clinical trials that they monitor. I found a wealth of information on what I can do now as well as what might be in store for me in my future. After my second diagnosis, I knew I wanted to create as much as I could in the sighted years I have left. Even then I had the urge to do something to further research on macular degeneration.</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">In trials, Fenretinide looked promising as a dry AMD treatment.

Hearing? Touch? Smell? Taste? Sight?"" You would most likely answer, ""My sight."" That's what the vast majority of people have replied in various national and international surveys. According to a recent poll, Americans fear blindness more than any other disability. As we age, the chance of developing an eye disease increases dramatically. Macular degeneration is an incurable eye disease that is the leading cause of blindness for those 55 and older in the United States. It affects more than 15 million Americans. As our population ages, the incidence of this disease is expected to explode in numbers.</span></p>

Macular degeneration limits or completely destroys our ability to read, drive a car, recognize faces or colors, safely navigate stairs, or see objects in fine detail. Unfortunately, the cause of macular degeneration is not completely understood and research is limited by insufficient funding.</span></p>

Souther has been living with a diagnosis of macular degeneration since 2001. That is why she has decided to donate 100 percent of the profits of her book to the research into this dread condition.

Art & Inspiration, a coffee table memoir, was written to answer that question. Last April, on a  three week, 7,500 + mile marketing trip, (my collaborative author who happens to be my mother Diane Elliott, an award winning author) and I wrote two thirds of this book. Back home, photographer and grant writer Linda Mitchell Griffith agreed to photograph the pieces for the book as well as design the layout.As a jewelry artist and registered architect (licensed in two states and LEED Accredited Professional), my hands and my eyes are the most important assets I own. In 2001 I was first diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). I didn't pay attention because the doctor said, ""it will be years before you have anything to worry about."" In fact I'd forgotten about it. Nine years later I changed eye doctors and this doctor was horrified that I was doing nothing for my AMD. He sent me to a retina specialist and she mapped my eyes. The macula in both eyes showed drusen, but being the dry type, she could do nothing. I told my mother and son about it. Mother began to cry. My son held her tight putting everything in perspective by saying, ""Amah, it's her sight, not her mind.""Eventually I found AMD.org,  Macular Degeneration Partnership, and discovered several things I could do to help slow the progress of AMD. I signed up for their newsleter to keep abreast of research and clinical trials that they monitor. I found a wealth of information on what I can do now as well as what might be in store for me in my future. After my second diagnosis, I knew I wanted to create as much as I could in the sighted years I have left. Even then I had the urge to do something to further research on macular degeneration.In trials, Fenretinide looked promising as a dry AMD treatment. This may never come to market due to lack of research funding. Our eventual goal is to raise funds through the sale and promotion of this book to advance research into AMD.Never Lose Sight! By Linda Mitchell Griffith
If you were to ask yourself ""Which of my five senses would I most hate to lose? Hearing? Touch? Smell? Taste? Sight?"" You would most likely answer, ""My sight."" That's what the vast majority of people have replied in various national and international surveys. According to a recent poll, Americans fear blindness more than any other disability. As we age, the chance of developing an eye disease increases dramatically. Macular degeneration is an incurable eye disease that is the leading cause of blindness for those 55 and older in the United States. It affects more than 15 million Americans. As our population ages, the incidence of this disease is expected to explode in numbers.
 
Macular degeneration is caused by the deterioration of the central portion of the retina, the inside back layer of the eye that records the images we see and sends them to the brain. Macular degeneration limits or completely destroys our ability to read, drive a car, recognize faces or colors, safely navigate stairs, or see objects in fine detail. Unfortunately, the cause of macular degeneration is not completely understood and research is limited by insufficient funding.
 
For an artist, the diagnosis of macular degeneration is devastating and overwhelmingly life-changing. Souther has been living with a diagnosis of macular degeneration since 2001. That is why she has decided to donate 100 percent of the profits of her book to the research into this dread condition. Souther and her friends have donated all their time and talents needed to make this book a reality. The costs they must cover are for the printing and promotion of the book.
 
According to AMD.org, a non profit corporation that is committed to improving research and methods of treatment for those impaired by macular degeneration, cutbacks in federal funding for medical research make it necessary to reach out for funding from the private sector. Souther wants her book to benefit this outstanding organization. AMD.org‘s research could make the difference in the lives of people who have, or will have, macular degeneration. Your partnership in this book will help provide assistance needed to save the precious sight of millions of our fellow human beings.
ART & INSPIRATION is scheduled to come out winter 2012.As I travel the United States promoting this book and raising funds for AMD research I will keep followers updated on Facebook about fundraising milestones and dollars sent to AMD.org.WHERE THE INDIEGOGO FUNDS WILL GO: Our goal is to raise enough money for the printing and binding of our first edition. The finished book will be a jacketed 7"" x 9"", 4 color print, on 100 pound acid-free matte paper. This project will be Smyth sewn with a hard cover using standard cloth and foil. It promises to be a beautiful presentation. If additional funds are raised they will be allocated to:

web site development
narrative CDs (especially useful for the visually limited)
envelopes, packing materials, postage more books - the first 2500 are much more expensive than the next 2500 if ordered together
HELP THIS PROJECT SEE THE LIGHT OF DAYIf you are able to pledge or better yet want to pre-order your copy and receive your book earlier than anyone else, a greater portion of your contribution will fund macular degeneration research than if we had gone with a traditional publishing venue.

All of your funding will go to prints, frames, books or transport costs. With enough money I think I can really come in and make the kind of impact I think my work deserves. This is a flexible funding campaign because I can use all you can give me. Thank you so much in advance.
How else can I help?

<span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px;"">OUR STORY</span><br/>
</h3>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">CAFKA organizes an exhibition of art in the public spaces of the Waterloo Region every two years.</span></h4><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">That’s
the CAFKA biennial.</span></h4><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">It’s
beautiful. It’s meaningful. It’s humorous.</span></span></h4><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you haven’t seen it before, we know it will blow you away.</span></h4><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
The art is installed in the streets, parks, storefronts and public atriums, mostly in downtown Kitchener and also in Cambridge and Waterloo. It’s public art, it’s free and it’s for everyone.</span></span></h4><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This year, the month-long biennial includes sixteen projects and opens on May 31,
2014. This will be CAFKA’s ninth ambitious exhibition. It’s called <a href=""http://www.cafka.org/news/cafka14-it-should-always-be-way"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">It Should Always Be This Way</a>. We like to think of it as a utopian dream.</span></h4><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The CAFKA biennial is a moving testament to ingenuity. It
challenges us to look deeper and, while we’re there, to think, express wonder and, quite often, laugh.</span></h4><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">CAFKA is an artist-run organization. We bring artists from all over the world and pay them well for their work.</span></span></h4><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Like just about any small arts organization, we are short of funds. In fact, we need to raise $20,000 to meet the total biennial budget of $95,000.</span></h4><h4>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Raising $20,000?</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span>

May 31 - June 29, 2014
OUR STORY

CAFKA organizes an exhibition of art in the public spaces of the Waterloo Region every two years.That’s
the CAFKA biennial.It’s
beautiful. It’s meaningful. It’s humorous.If you haven’t seen it before, we know it will blow you away.
The art is installed in the streets, parks, storefronts and public atriums, mostly in downtown Kitchener and also in Cambridge and Waterloo. It’s public art, it’s free and it’s for everyone.This year, the month-long biennial includes sixteen projects and opens on May 31,
2014. This will be CAFKA’s ninth ambitious exhibition. It’s called It Should Always Be This Way. We like to think of it as a utopian dream.The CAFKA biennial is a moving testament to ingenuity. It
challenges us to look deeper and, while we’re there, to think, express wonder and, quite often, laugh.CAFKA is an artist-run organization. We bring artists from all over the world and pay them well for their work.Like just about any small arts organization, we are short of funds. In fact, we need to raise $20,000 to meet the total biennial budget of $95,000.
Raising $20,000?
That’s
200 people donating $100.That’s
400 people donating $50.
Are
there 200 people out there who can give $100 to keep this dream alive? Are there 400
people who can give $50?
We
hope there are.All funds raised support installation costs for 16 projects, including building costs, artist fees & materials, travel, accommodation, administration and marketing
expenses for the CAFKA 14 biennial exhibition.Cultural
events like this one have never mattered more to Waterloo Region, especially in
downtown Kitchener, where people are working so hard, transforming the town. CAFKA is a piece of
that puzzle and it’s something we can be proud of. But it's pretty hard to do it alone.We need you to become a stakeholder in CAFKA, and help us create
something amazing.By supporting CAFKA, you are contributing to a thriving, vibrant cultural life in Kitchener and Waterloo Region.Please, please donate if you can! Help us spread the word by sharing this campaign with your network.Thank you!

<p>We’re passionate about people, nature, culture, and art.  This trip will fuel those passions and teach us incredible things about the world we live in.  We’ll each be keeping blogs while we’re abroad so be sure to follow us and keep updated!  By funding our campaign you’ll not only get a personalized piece of art from our trip, but you’ll be an integral part of making our dream become a reality. </p>

Before you think to yourself, ""what a loser"" and hit stop, please let me show you some examples of my paintings. (refer to video)<br/><br/>Now you may ask, ""With a body of work that large, how did this guy end up in this position?""<br/>Well, 8 years ago I left a very successful career in Logistics to focus on my artwork and to become a full time artist. <br/>That did not happen like I thought it would.<br/>People in the ""art world"" do not always take self-taught outside artists very seriously. <br/>I have had various jobs during the past 8 years in order to pay the bills. <br/>I have sold cars, did temp work, and even worked at a pharmaceutical company. <br/>The past 4 years I have worked at a local restaurant. <br/>That job recently ended. <br/><br/>Now it's time for a change. <br/>That change is moving to New Orleans, LA. <br/>I lived in New Orleans for about 6 months way back in 2000.<br/>This experience is what inspired me to start painting when I moved back to Indianapolis for what I thought was going to be my career in Logistics. <br/>Now I would like to return to the BIG EASY to try and re-capture that inspiration. <br/>I feel that I have had a good go at trying to make it as an artist in Indianapolis the past 14 years. <br/>I have been very fortunate to be able to sell my work here on the eastside.<br/>I have also had the opportunity to create artwork for local musicians. <br/>None of this however has enabled me to create art full time.<br/>I am now ready for a change of pace, scenery, and development. <br/><br/>Why New Orleans?<br/>New Orleans is a vibrant city, with a rich history. <br/>The cost of living is not extremely high and with public transportation and the trolley system, you can get around without a vehicle.<br/>Inspiration can be found in the music, food, people, and architecture. <br/>This is the inspiration I am seeking. <br/>There isn't the level of pretentiousness in New Orleans that seems to exist in other major cities when it comes to art. <br/>At the end of this campaign I am planning on taking a Greyhound bus from Indianapolis to New Orleans.<br/>I will only be taking a duffle bag and a backpack with me. <br/><br/><br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>Now, what do I need?<br/>I am asking for donations to fund my relocation.  <br/>At the time of this video I have not found a room to rent yet, but will be doing so while this campaign is going on.<br/>I am trying to procure enough money to pay for: <br/>Deposit and first two months rent for a place to live.<br/>Bus ticket from Indianapolis to New Orleans.<br/>Food for 2 months.<br/>A very cheap phone (to help me find a job).<br/>A small amount of art supplies<br/>And a small cushion for ""just in case"".<br/><br/>Please know that I am not looking for a free vacation here. <br/>I truly am trying to further my artistic style and become a full time artist. <br/>You can help me do that. <br/>Now I understand that this is not what ""crowd-funding"" is normally for. <br/>I am asking for an investment in ME. <br/><br/>What do you get for investing in a true outside artist?<br/>Once
 in New Orleans I will be seeking employment of some sort, but I will be
 getting right back to work on my paintings, only it will be in a new 
environment with new inspirations.<br/>For a $10 donation you will receive a handwritten thank you letter and drawing from me.<br/>For a $25 donation you will receive an original abstract watercolor piece. <br/>For a $100 donation you will receive 10"" x 10"" original acrylic on canvas abstract painting. <br/>And for a $200 donation you will receive a 20"" x 16"" original acrylic on canvas abstract painting. <br/>I am planning on these original pieces to be the foundation for my next era of paintings. <br/>You will be getting the very first ones!
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>This is certainly a life-changing event for me. <br/>I have given everything away in order to make art. <br/>At 38 years old I have a drive and determination for this and I will pursue becoming a full time artist until I die. <br/><br/>Please know that all money donated will go toward this relocation event. <br/>I am not trying to scam or take advantage of anyone. <br/>I am looking for help.<br/>I
 will be leaving for New Orleans regardless of the outcome of this 
campaign, however, this campaign will be the difference between me 
having to hitchhike there or taking a bus and having a place to live or 
being homeless once I arrive. <br/>It's just too cold to be homeless in Indianapolis during the winter.<br/><br/>With your donation you are helping me relocate to an amazing city, 
allowing me to continue this journey as an artist, and you will get an 
original letter, watercolor, or painting from me. <br/><br/>Please help a broke artist continue his creative journey. <br/><br/>Thank you.<br/>CHAD.<br/>
</div> <br/><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>I am also selling the last of my Indianapolis based work on eBay. <br/>You can view these here: <b><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/o78v36b"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/o78v36b</a></b><br/>These will only be available at these prices until this campaign ends. <br/>

That did not happen like I thought it would.People in the ""art world"" do not always take self-taught outside artists very seriously. I have had various jobs during the past 8 years in order to pay the bills. I have sold cars, did temp work, and even worked at a pharmaceutical company.

The cost of living is not extremely high and with public transportation and the trolley system, you can get around without a vehicle.Inspiration can be found in the music, food, people, and architecture. This is the inspiration I am seeking. There isn't the level of pretentiousness in New Orleans that seems to exist in other major cities when it comes to art. At the end of this campaign I am planning on taking a Greyhound bus from Indianapolis to New Orleans.I will only be taking a duffle bag and a backpack with me.    What I Need & What You Get Now, what do I need?I am asking for donations to fund my relocation.  At the time of this video I have not found a room to rent yet, but will be doing so while this campaign is going on.I am trying to procure enough money to pay for: Deposit and first two months rent for a place to live.Bus ticket from Indianapolis to New Orleans.Food for 2 months.A very cheap phone (to help me find a job).A small amount of art suppliesAnd a small cushion for ""just in case"".Please know that I am not looking for a free vacation here. I truly am trying to further my artistic style and become a full time artist. You can help me do that. Now I understand that this is not what ""crowd-funding"" is normally for. I am asking for an investment in ME. What do you get for investing in a true outside artist?Once
 in New Orleans I will be seeking employment of some sort, but I will be
 getting right back to work on my paintings, only it will be in a new 
environment with new inspirations.For a $10 donation you will receive a handwritten thank you letter and drawing from me.For a $25 donation you will receive an original abstract watercolor piece. For a $100 donation you will receive 10"" x 10"" original acrylic on canvas abstract painting. And for a $200 donation you will receive a 20"" x 16"" original acrylic on canvas abstract painting. I am planning on these original pieces to be the foundation for my next era of paintings. You will be getting the very first ones!
  The Impact This is certainly a life-changing event for me. I have given everything away in order to make art. At 38 years old I have a drive and determination for this and I will pursue becoming a full time artist until I die. Please know that all money donated will go toward this relocation event. I am not trying to scam or take advantage of anyone. I am looking for help.I
 will be leaving for New Orleans regardless of the outcome of this 
campaign, however, this campaign will be the difference between me 
having to hitchhike there or taking a bus and having a place to live or 
being homeless once I arrive. It's just too cold to be homeless in Indianapolis during the winter.With your donation you are helping me relocate to an amazing city, 
allowing me to continue this journey as an artist, and you will get an 
original letter, watercolor, or painting from me. Please help a broke artist continue his creative journey. Thank you.CHAD.
  Other Ways You Can HelpI am also selling the last of my Indianapolis based work on eBay. You can view these here: http://tinyurl.com/o78v36bThese will only be available at these prices until this campaign ends.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

A cutting edge installation and live audio-visual performance, it explores new forms of interactive music, sculpture and film, and seeks to capture the atmosphere of magical wonder and innovative technology found in the late 19th Century parlours of science, magic and invention.The Creatures combine a multitude of perspectives, offering tremendous opportunities for makers and artists from across many disciplines to collaborate.  The Creatues have worked with multimedia artists, projection mappers, electronic musicians, beat-boxers, gospel singers, classical vocalists, programmers, interface designers, engineers, fabricators, generative sound artists, sculptors, and evolutionary coders, among others, in finding compelling new ways to tell meaningful human stories. Give the Creatures New LifeFor Burning Man, we must rebuild the Creature Choir to withstand the extreme conditions of the Nevada Desert - 110mph winds, scorching heat in the day, freezing conditions at night, alkaline sand that bites into  everything from skin to metal.

Annie later opened her own gallery spaces, including the Annie Bolling Gallery in Oakley and PAC Gallery in East Walnut Hills.</p><p>It's from her work with young artists that Annie is reminded of how important art is to, not only a community, but to society as a whole.

And when you find those kids who are generally happy about what they do, about who they are, you can bet that somewhere in their lives, art has made a connection.""- Frank WalkerKentucky Governor’s School for the ArtsThe Mission Art Education funds in our schools are being cut or eliminated entirely. The Gallery Project is ART, COMMUNITY, CONNECTION. We are a non-profit incubator where today's youth learn about art, community, identity and commerce.  A unique environment where dialogue is created using traditional art forms and exploring new boundaries to form a conversation for experimental projects.  This platform serves as a catalyst to use art to create both community and social change.A place that embraces cultural diversity and brings communities together through projects that foster and ignite the creative spirit. The Gallery Project will offer programming that will build up the individual, make them feel part of something and boost confidence. Programming will be centered around team building art projects that help communities break down barriers, work together and be a part of something that has a positive impact on society. Throughout the creative process, young people can celebrate diversity and their individual response to the world around them. These programs can also play a special role in reducing racial and income achievement gaps by providing access to enrichment activities more readily available to higher income students. All donations are tax-deductible.  Founder and Director, Annie Bolling has more than 15 years of experience working in a variety of gallery environments. After obtaining her B.F.A. from the University of Cincinnati's School of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning, Annie began her        professional career at Closson's. There she worked closely with Phyllis Weston, a long-time champion of the arts in Cincinnati. Annie's energy, attitude and zeal have solidified her place in the gallery scene and with Weston, she partnered to create the Phyllis Weston-Annie Bolling Gallery. Annie later opened her own gallery spaces, including the Annie Bolling Gallery in Oakley and PAC Gallery in East Walnut Hills.It's from her work with young artists that Annie is reminded of how important art is to, not only a community, but to society as a whole. And, while she has an affinity for contemporary art, Annie equally values making art more accessible through a variety of methods, styles and mediums.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2><strong>Who Are We?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Existence is Resistance Our Mission Statement</strong></h3>
<p>Existence is Resistance (EIR) was founded in 2009 following the grotesque offensive bombing attacks on Gaza. While the bombing was still going on, we quickly organized a relief concert in New York City raising a few thousand dollars for the victims in just two hours. After seeing the diverse crowd and unity of the attendees and all that were willing to help, we quickly realized the power of music and artistic expression in the context of oppression. EIR promotes and implements this theory in all past and future projects. EIR strives to unite marginalized youth globally with outlets in the arts to express, process and improve their situations. Our organization is here to work in the communities of those under going oppression while recognizing the empowering artistic talents of the people, we feel that one must acknowledge that inspiration is the key to expressing these talents, and the proper tools to find ones ability is the catalyst for great change. An empowered society is a powerful society.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What Do We Want To Do?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>2012 Project </strong></h3>
<p>Living under occupation, creative expression is often stifled. Lack of funds,<br/>violence and other obstacles regularly prevent school-aged youth from expressive, artistic activities that belong to a healthy childhood. We believe through culture, arts and shown solidarity, these children facing adversity will become inspired to create the society in which they deserve to exist. Existence is Resistance is hoping to conduct its 2012 Tour  for ten days expanding the cities visited in previous years, increasing the variety of workshops to include filming, editing, web-designing and ensuring that there will be at least one instructor in each youth center EIR works with to continue the programs. EIR hopes to again donate laptops and cameras (specifically flipcams) to each youth center. Tours of each city will be conducted earlier in the day with a local to explain each cities history and current situations, workshops will commence for 5 hours a day ending with a show every other evening in which the children who participated in the workshops also perform with the artists to show what they learnt. The children’s footage filmed during the entire tour will be used in our next documentary.</p>
<p>We have some amazing artists interested in going this year, all of which are donating their time and efforts. Funding is strictly for the transportation, hiring of the buses in the West Bank, food and accomodation which we purchase 100% from the refugee camps. Most money goes on the purchase of laptops and cameras in the West Bank at a Palestinian-owned business. Bearing in mind it is a little more expensive there but we do want to keep all monies there if possible. </p>
<p>Financial reports are available each year upon request for all non-profit and foundation grants within a few weeks of returning from the tour. Individual donors are also eligible to view our extremely transparent reports.</p>

<h3><strong>Past Tours</strong></h3>
<p><strong>“24 hrs” Gaza Strip July 2009</strong><br/>In July 2009, Existence is Resistance took a small delegation of Hip Hop artists with a humanitarian convoy to the Gaza strip. Dealing with stressful situations whilst being stuck in Egypt for 8 days, after days of negotiations, the convoy was eventually permitted to enter Gaza for only 24 hours. During those 24 hours EIR took the artists to the home of a Palestinian artist which had been bombed and resulted in his fathers death. EIR also took them on a complete tour of the destruction and beauty of Gaza and its people. The artists talked to Gazans at a prisoner center where mothers, children and others who have lost loved ones and performed before leaving at a Gaza Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>“Bus Stop Hip Hop Tour” West Bank 2010</strong><br/>Existence is Resistance, The South West Youth Collaborative and The University of Hip Hop Chicago, came together last year and organized a ten day musical/artistic workshop and performance tour in the West Bank. The Seven artists from the United States/United Kingdom and the two youth performers from SWYC/UHHC conducted daily workshops with the children<br/>in the refugee camps and occupied West Bank. The tour reached 6 cities, the performers of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds and of different faiths. The tour was documented and will be released on DVD May 2011 titled “Hip Hop is Bigger than the Occupation”. Donations from Caipirinha Foundation made it possible for EIR to purchase and donate musical instruments for the youth centers within the refugee camps.</p>
<p><strong><strong>“Freedom Tour” West Bank 2011</strong><br/></strong>Existence is Resistance again raised funds to conduct a ten day tour throughout the West Bank with artists from the US and the UK. During the time there the tour visited ""Nabi Saleh"" and could not conduct the workshops, nor tour since the Israeli army came in and started firing all over. The tour was sitting in one house which was also gassed during this time. The tour was named the Freedom Tour in dedication to Juliano Mer-Khamis, Founder of the Freedom theater in Jenin who was murdered earlier that year.  This year we donated laptops and flipcams to the centers we worked with teaching the youth how to film, edit and upload. </p>

</p><p>Okay, here
we go!</p>
<p>For the last two years I have tried to start my own
company named <a href=""http://pinkwhy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pinkwhY</a>. I was fixed by the idea of being a founder which seems to be something
“en vogue” in these days. <br/></p><p>Currently I am in deep trouble as it seems to be tough to attract German business angels and investors for funding. See more below at the headline: Trouble ahead: Jail is calling<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>About my business idea:</b><br/></p><p>I thought (and still do) that my idea is good. Of
course. The roughest description is “online art trading platform”. But the idea
is more than only trading original artworks as almost every online plat form
does. I have studied and experienced the art market for a long time now. Out there
are many platforms who offer artworks. From my perspective an online concept
should consider more than simply putting an analog product into a web shop.
Exactly that's what all online art traders are doing so far. Hence we are – we means
the future company – going to make advantage of this by using technical
achievements to make art reproducible and as well digital. The digital product
will be a novelty in the art industry and will give users the chance even to
utilize art on screens and way more interesting in the digital sphere.</p>
<p>A comparison of the music and book industry examines,
that this is possible. In those industries reproduction is established for
centuries. And both have realized that customer needs have changed and that the
business future lies in the digital sphere. Thus they adjust their business
models – successful as the music industries proofs with own downloads offers –
since they painfully suffered from illegal downloads. This indicates a high potential
for the art industry.</p>
<p>Here are the unique selling points of my concept:</p>
<p><b><span>1.<span>  </span></span></b><b>Digitalization &amp;
Reproduction:</b> This allows to establish new revenue streams
for artists. Or to turn the question around. You never purchase the master tape
or the original manuscript. Or do you have the master tape of Rolling Stones
“Satisfaction”? Would it be that worth and well known when there were no records
of it sold? Why then do so many people try to explain that art should be
different? Of course the Rolling Stones are live the best. But do you really
care when your number one hit streams through your headphones? Digitalization
&amp; Reproduction allows to establish a kind of art billboard charts. As the
price development in the art industry is opaque we are going to deliver
transparency. From now on not gallerists are saying what is hot or not and what
the prices will be. But the customer. It also allows to focus a mass market who
hasn’t been touched so far. The success of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Banksy</a> highlighted this as he
received the fame from thousands of art lovers but not from the Gallery scene
in his early days.</p>
<p>The digitalization will not be a
problem for the art industry in case you learn from other creative industries.
Or as Kevin Spacey puts it for the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">film industry</a>: “We have learned the lesson
that the music industry didn't learn. Give people <b><u>what</u></b> they want,
<b><u>when</u></b> they want it, in the <b><u>form</u></b> they want it in, at
a <b><u>reasonable price</u></b> – and they'll more likely pay for it rather
than steal it.“</p>
<p><b><span>2.<span>  </span></span></b><b>Focus on talented and upcoming
artists of all genres: </b>The majority of art lovers only
focus on big artist. As an art lover you want to be the first one who discovers
a new upcoming artist. Hence it is important to get new artists on the radar as
there are so many fantastic ones are out there waiting to get a chance. Though
we focus the pre-gallery-market to bring structure in it. Like my space does. </p>
<p><b><span>3.<span>  </span></span></b><b>Focus on affordable Artworks </b>(average
artwork below 3.000 Euro)<b>: </b>To be honest
- all the Richters, Koons and Hirsts have started as no names. That was the
time when their original artworks were affordable to an even way much bigger
market. The more successful they are the more their value increases. Hence it
is interesting to be one of the first owners for the originals. Also if you are
not a rich customer. </p>
<p>Okay, many people will now argue
that is better to focus on the expensive products. Well let’s have a look on the
automobile industry. You never buy the prototype. And not every customer can
purchase for example a Lamborghini. Instead the majority of customers can only
achieve e.g. a good Volkswagen. That’s what we focus on. And guess what.
Lamborghini is part of the Volkswagen Group.</p>
<p><b><span>4.<span>  </span></span></b><b>Participation on value increase:</b> That’s
another important side effect from the Digitalization &amp; Reproduction
element. Especially for the artist who participates the most on a value
increase. In case you sell reproductions and the original artwork is still on
stock – the sold reproductions are an indicator that there is or will be a
demand for the original artwork. Maybe not at the moment. But the more
reproductions are sold the more the price for the original artwork can
increase. That’s the moment when the Volkswagen becomes a Lamborghini.</p>
<p>When I look
on the USP´s we are a combination of e-commerce and digital media with
influences of a good gallery, <a href=""http://www.lumas.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lumas</a> and <a href=""http://www.jestadigital.com/brands/jamba/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jamba/Jamster</a>. Thus I don’t fear other internet art
startups such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artsy_%28website%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Artsy</a> or Amazon´s efforts to become a relevant art trader. What
I am concerned of is the bad experience of other founders with copycats who are
copying good concepts and sometimes are more successful than the original idea.
Hence it is my intent not to face the same experience, and to collect enough
money to be prepared for that challenge. To give a clear idea of what I am
talking about I refer to the invasion of the Normandy. In order to achieve the
overall goal to defeat the Third Reich it was relevant not only to have enough
resources to win a single battle. It was relevant to make sure to have enough
resources in order to win the entire war! </p>
<p>So far so
good. With focus on collecting money my problems started. I never was able to
raise enough money neither to cover my personal monthly costs nor to shift the
focus on customer acquisition. There were so many people who showed interest to
invest in my idea but who withdraw their interest when it came down to sign the
contract. Though I had to struggle every month to survive and was able to push
the idea only in little steps. Yes, my intend was and is not to start small
like starting as a small gallery. So many galleries face a hard life nowadays.
I want to make advantage out of it by combining it with the internet and the
digital. Nevertheless we have achieved several relevant elements to get start
the company right in the moment we find an investor. The business plan is
written and the concept was reviewed and certified of plausibility by the <a href=""http://www.halle.ihk.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chamber of Commerce Halle-Dessau</a>. We also received a certification for “innovative concept”
from the <a href=""http://hochschulgruender.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Academic Founders Network Saxony-Anhalt</a>. An expert jury (lawyer, tax
account, bank, and entrepreneur) from the <a href=""http://www.wjd.de/CircleDetails.WJD?cid=218"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Junior International Club Dessau</a> gave
a general recommendation to investment in the idea. There are also investors
like private family offices and venture capital who would like to invest in a
real Series A round. And we have customers from both; B2B and B2C who are waiting
for our official start.</p>
<p>I, two
other founders, a small team, and two board members are ready to implement the concept
and to demonstrate the proof of concept. Therefore 4 Million Euro are necessary
within the next three years to set up the company and to get the pace which is
relevant to win the battles in the art market. No worries we don’t need the
entire amount at once. I simply want to make sure that we don’t lack on financial support when
we have started. Hence we are currently looking for 50.000 Euro up to 250.000 Euro.</p>
<p><br/></p><p><b>Trouble ahead: Jail is calling</b><br/></p><p>Nevertheless,
putting all energy and focus on collecting money I lost the most important
aspect. To make people and artists happy. Many investors say they want to
see a founder’s passion and power of endurance. This is my proof. I was also
able to collect money from family, friends and “fools” to get to this point. As mentioned it was never enough to cover my monthly costs. The current situation is as
follows: I have the last 200 Euro in my hands and on next Monday I am going to
lose my apartment and my office if I am not able to collect some money. Therefore
at least 5.000 Euro are necessary to avoid it. Otherwise I am going to be homeless and furthermore to get into jail. This would break my neck.<br/></p>
<p>But this is not going to happen as I am willing
to get to the next point while collecting the necessary amount to start the
company. Because for several weeks now I am struggling with the decision either
to try to move on or to stop all my startup activities and to find a job. I applied
for regular jobs but to be honest: I can’t get the business idea out of my
mind. So I started to think about what kind of other option could be possible.
While thinking through it and writing it down it seems to be an important and
also extraordinary situation. And this requires extraordinary action. Doing
another pitch or being another funding project on a platform? No! Hence it is my
intention to turn this around. It’s important to get on the radar of the right
people. </p>
<p>As so many
investors stress the fact that they only invest in founders who put the
interests of the company above their own I decided to give proof of exactly this.
I will give proof again of my willingness. An essential quote is on my mind for
almost a year now and which characterizes my personal attitude:</p>
<p><i>I will always place the
mission first.</i></p>
<p><i>I will never accept defeat.</i></p>
<p><i>I will never quit.</i></p>
<p>This is
what I was trained for: As a soldier and officer who completed deployments to
the Kosovo and to Afghanistan. So please investors don’t tell me anymore something
about commitment, responsibility, teamwork, management or even leadership! </p>
<p>My decision
is still clear: I will move on. For now with a full strategy change as I wasted
too much time to identify potential Business Angels and VC´s and to get access
to them. At least to get a “no interest” or even no reply at all. Or even to
get the runaround with a decision. I don’t care anymore if my idea is not in
your investment focus; or the company generates no profit so far; or you don’t
believe in a specific piece of the entire business plan; or you don’t know me;
or we are just another startup amongst many (the same is vice versa); or you
have a friend in the art sphere who does not believe in the entire business idea
(of course not as we are going to change it); or you simply don’t have the nuts
to take the risk. I don’t want to waste my time any longer. I want to meet the
people whom I haven’t met so far and who want to provide financial support.

we go!
For the last two years I have tried to start my own
company named pinkwhY. I was fixed by the idea of being a founder which seems to be something
“en vogue” in these days. Currently I am in deep trouble as it seems to be tough to attract German business angels and investors for funding. See more below at the headline: Trouble ahead: Jail is callingAbout my business idea:I thought (and still do) that my idea is good. Of
course. The roughest description is “online art trading platform”. But the idea
is more than only trading original artworks as almost every online plat form
does. I have studied and experienced the art market for a long time now. Out there
are many platforms who offer artworks. From my perspective an online concept
should consider more than simply putting an analog product into a web shop.
Exactly that's what all online art traders are doing so far. Hence we are – we means
the future company – going to make advantage of this by using technical
achievements to make art reproducible and as well digital. The digital product
will be a novelty in the art industry and will give users the chance even to
utilize art on screens and way more interesting in the digital sphere.
A comparison of the music and book industry examines,
that this is possible. In those industries reproduction is established for
centuries. And both have realized that customer needs have changed and that the
business future lies in the digital sphere. Thus they adjust their business
models – successful as the music industries proofs with own downloads offers –
since they painfully suffered from illegal downloads. This indicates a high potential
for the art industry.
Here are the unique selling points of my concept:
1.  Digitalization &
Reproduction: This allows to establish new revenue streams
for artists. Or to turn the question around. You never purchase the master tape
or the original manuscript. Or do you have the master tape of Rolling Stones
“Satisfaction”? Would it be that worth and well known when there were no records
of it sold? Why then do so many people try to explain that art should be
different? Of course the Rolling Stones are live the best. But do you really
care when your number one hit streams through your headphones? Digitalization
& Reproduction allows to establish a kind of art billboard charts. As the
price development in the art industry is opaque we are going to deliver
transparency. From now on not gallerists are saying what is hot or not and what
the prices will be. But the customer. It also allows to focus a mass market who
hasn’t been touched so far. The success of Banksy highlighted this as he
received the fame from thousands of art lovers but not from the Gallery scene
in his early days.
The digitalization will not be a
problem for the art industry in case you learn from other creative industries.
Or as Kevin Spacey puts it for the film industry: “We have learned the lesson
that the music industry didn't learn. Give people what they want,
when they want it, in the form they want it in, at
a reasonable price – and they'll more likely pay for it rather
than steal it.“
2.  Focus on talented and upcoming
artists of all genres: The majority of art lovers only
focus on big artist. As an art lover you want to be the first one who discovers
a new upcoming artist. Hence it is important to get new artists on the radar as
there are so many fantastic ones are out there waiting to get a chance. Though
we focus the pre-gallery-market to bring structure in it. Like my space does. 
3.  Focus on affordable Artworks (average
artwork below 3.000 Euro): To be honest
- all the Richters, Koons and Hirsts have started as no names. That was the
time when their original artworks were affordable to an even way much bigger
market. The more successful they are the more their value increases. Hence it
is interesting to be one of the first owners for the originals. Also if you are
not a rich customer. 
Okay, many people will now argue
that is better to focus on the expensive products. Well let’s have a look on the

reproductions are sold the more the price for the original artwork can
increase. That’s the moment when the Volkswagen becomes a Lamborghini.
When I look
on the USP´s we are a combination of e-commerce and digital media with

Most of us are impoverished and fairly broke most of the time, just like  others in the low-income neighborhoods where we live. Frequently, big, yellow machines with great claws destroy our houses and also our neighbors' houses, and then we have to leave, if we can find somewhere to go. But wherever we go, the big machines follow us and chase us away again, along with our new neighbors. This is a Houston story. It is an American story. It is a global story. We are raising money to put on a huge event that will fund radical alternatives to gentrification through collective action. The Big Machine will support The Hardy Yards community garden, and also some local artists whose bodies lie in the path of these big machines. </p><br/><p>The Big Machine is a reflection on gentrification and human displacement. The artists will bring into question the artist’s role in this process. The Big Machine explores the power of artists to react, question, and subvert the process of gentrification. The Big Machine features an alternate socialistic economy for how contributions will be distributed. Art will be sold at auction on a 75/25 split favoring the artist. After expenses are met, remaining proceeds will be divided equally among all participating artists/performers.</p><br/><p>Goal: $1375</p><br/><p>* Make sure all non-commercial artists get compensated for showing their art, even if it doesn’t sell at auction.</p><br/><p>Expenses:</p><ul><li>Lighting 250</li></ul><ul><li>Tables 250</li></ul><ul>

<li><p>Trash Bags 30</p></li>
<li><p>Markers/Posters/Tape 55</p></li>
</ul><br/><br/><p>If art does not thrive, the community does not thrive. If we are to take on the problem of gentrification, we must begin with our own role in the process. Artists love our neighborhoods, and we want them to be strong. The Big Machine brings us all together, in collective action, to support our neighborhoods while also recognizing that artists have expenses to pay rent, buy food, and make art. Collective action empowers people and neighborhoods. Artists are not powerless over poverty, and neighborhoods are not powerless over gentrification.

Most of us are impoverished and fairly broke most of the time, just like  others in the low-income neighborhoods where we live. Frequently, big, yellow machines with great claws destroy our houses and also our neighbors' houses, and then we have to leave, if we can find somewhere to go. But wherever we go, the big machines follow us and chase us away again, along with our new neighbors. This is a Houston story. It is an American story. It is a global story. We are raising money to put on a huge event that will fund radical alternatives to gentrification through collective action. The Big Machine will support The Hardy Yards community garden, and also some local artists whose bodies lie in the path of these big machines. The Big Machine is a reflection on gentrification and human displacement. The artists will bring into question the artist’s role in this process. The Big Machine explores the power of artists to react, question, and subvert the process of gentrification. The Big Machine features an alternate socialistic economy for how contributions will be distributed. Art will be sold at auction on a 75/25 split favoring the artist. After expenses are met, remaining proceeds will be divided equally among all participating artists/performers.Goal: $1375* Make sure all non-commercial artists get compensated for showing their art, even if it doesn’t sell at auction.Expenses:Lighting 250Tables 250

If art does not thrive, the community does not thrive. If we are to take on the problem of gentrification, we must begin with our own role in the process. Artists love our neighborhoods, and we want them to be strong. The Big Machine brings us all together, in collective action, to support our neighborhoods while also recognizing that artists have expenses to pay rent, buy food, and make art. Collective action empowers people and neighborhoods. Artists are not powerless over poverty, and neighborhoods are not powerless over gentrification. We are helping to empower artists and neighborhoods into developing radical alternatives to gentrification and human displacement.It is possible that we will make very little money, and artists might only collect pennies for their share. It is possible that we will not make very much for the Hardy Yards, either. But it is certain that we will make great art and set up a big ruckus and raise consciousness all around.Images of Perks:Perk 4, ""Blooming"" by Jonatan LopezPerk 5, ""Of Mapplethorn"" by Chris ComperryPerk 7Custom Made PicnicPerk 8, ""The Move"" by Thien Ho

project started just over three years ago. Corinne and Shivani 
discovered an overlap in their art forms: a passion for using their art 
to transmit stories.  This evolved into a huge project, spanning three 
different geographical regions in India.  We lived with communities in 
the Himalayas in Ladakh, the jungle in Madhya Pradesh, and spent some 
time with weaving communities in the desert in Rajasthan.  <br/><br/>Shivani
 photographed the stories while Corinne worked with translators to 
render them into various literary forms, such as traditional poetry, 
short fiction, and more avant garde poems.  <br/><br/>Read more about the comprehensive project in the Times of India article <a href=""http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/people/2-women-look-for-a-story-none-of-us-have-heard/articleshow/14206328.cms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. <br/><br/>However, due to 
illness and lack of funds, our project was cut short and we were unable 
to finish our filming in Rajasthan.  The funding we raise here will enable us to finish this last step of the piece. This project has already begun to 
bloom into a beautiful multimedia, multi-disciplinary piece of 
storytelling.  <br/><br/>We have been featured as a <a href=""http://www.chameleonartprojects.com/Thread_Whispers_ch_01.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">collateral show in the Goa International Photo Festival</a> and at <a href=""http://www.artrygroup.org/rop.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Art*ry gallery in Kochi</a>.  <a href=""http://www.vervemagazine.in/tag/thread-whispers-chapter-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Verve Magazine</a> chose us out of all the exhibitions in the Goa photo festival

 people fairly for their work and their time.  Shooting stories with us 
takes away from people's valuable time working in the fields or with 
their looms.  Therefore, it is incredibly important to us that people 
are compensated in a fair, sustainable way for their time and 
participation.<br/><br/> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>How we will use the funding </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Many
 people think art is something generally limited to the city, to urban 
life-- and particularly to the more wealthy and privileged. In our 
project, we are looking for a meeting place between urban and rural, 
between international and local.  We are looking for meeting points 
between our own experiences as artists and storytellers, and the 
experiences of the people in these communities who tell us their 
stories.</p>
<p>When we shoot the stories, we work within the community 
to creatively make the scenes come alive, using local traditional 
clothing and materials, as well as working with people to make costumes 
out of found materials.  In Ladakh, we worked with a few kids with only 
trash bags, kohl, and some other odds and ends to transform them into 
talking crows from a fairy tale.     </p> <p> </p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>Hi! We are the Iron Monkeys, a collection of volunteer artists, metalworkers, dreamers and do-gooders. We are based in the Georgetown neighborhood of Seattle, but have our dirty primate fingers in cities and towns from Vancouver, BC, New York, San Francisco, and all the way across the pond to London. We believe that art should be an experience , and we endeavor with each piece we build to warm and welcome all who wander our way. For over a decade we have been building and burning art together and this year is no exception.</p> <h2>What the heck are we building this year?</h2>
<p>Our piece is called The Plaza of Introspectus. It is a 60’ wide gathering space laid out in the shape of a compass with the arrows pointed inward. A flaming steel armillary on an 8’ pedestal will be the centerpiece of the Plaza. Metal benches and fire zen gardens fill the space offering rest and reflection.</p> <h2>Another gathering space, sweet! What’s new this year?</h2>
<p>First off, we’re blacksmithing eight new benches. We are calling them gossip benches, designed to sit and talk face-to-face either about your burn or about all the the blacksmithing involved in this years project.</p> <p>Like to play with fire? Well you are in luck! New zen gardens will be built and placed in the Plaza allowing participants of Black Rock City to draw in some fiery sand.</p> <p>The biggest new thing we are building this year will be the armillary, which is the centerpiece of the Plaza. An armillary is a spherical astronomical map composed of rings, and the one we build is going to be big, be on an 8' pedestal, and be raging with fire at night.</p>
<h2>Sweet! But what does the money go to?</h2> <p>We have a received a grant from Burning Man to pay for some of the creation of Plaza of Introspectus but, it doesn’t cover all of our costs. We are asking for an additional $12,000 to help bridge the gap. The money we raise from you fine folks will help pay for: transportation, steel, bolts, taps, welding gas, oxygen, lighting, storage for the pieces of the project, propane, and much more.</p>
<h2>Help a Monkey out?</h2>
<p>Now is when we ask you to help us! Any gift, from $1.00 to $1,000 helps us create this piece of art. We have a bunch of great rewards this year to entice you. Check them out out over on the right.</p>
<p>Thank you! THANK YOU! There is no way we could build this kind of big ass art without the support of our friends and fans. This is our 13th year in Black Rock City and it is thanks to all of our supporters (that's YOU!) that we have thrived for so long. We look forward to sharing our art  with the masses yet again, be it in Seattle, in Black Rock City, or beyond!</p> <p>From the bottom of our rusty little hearts, thank you.</p>
<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>This is our 13th year building a project for Black Rock City, and we have completed our project on time, every time.</p>
<p>That said, things do happen. If we find ourselves in a crunch for time there are elements of the project we can simplify or cut out.</p>

<p></p></span></span></div>","Summary of the Project
Dean and Lauren were brought together by the Reel Asian Film festival to collaborate on a project.  
They had never met before.  
The project had to be a mix of dance and film, Dean repping the Film and Lauren/Alias Dance Project repping the dance.  
Dean and Lauren started having meetings, trying to figure out what kind of a project they wanted to work on.  Their brainstorming sessions included coloured blocks, diagrams, and other objects.  They finally decided they were going to rework Lauren's 'Restorative Structure' into an interactive film and dance performance piece. 
Lauren's inspiration for this piece came from her experience of watching the mind and body of someone very close to her be taken over by alzheimer's disease.  They connected on this subject matter immediately as Dean also had personal experiences dealing with mental disease in his family.  
TODAY... the only thing that is missing is the financial support to make this vision a reality.  Given the time, studio space, funding and the support of the fabulous artists that surround us, the potential for this project is endless.  
What we need and what you get!
We need the resources to complete the creative process and film production of this project.
All proceeds from this campaign will support:
-the production and post production of the film
-the rental of equipment and space
-THE ARTISTS (!!!)
Right now, our goal is low: $1500.00.  The reason is that if we don't reach our goal, Indiegogo will take an additional 5%  (they take 4%, no matter what) of the funds raised as a fee.  If we can raise $3000, we will be able to pay the artists what they deserve for their collaboration and contribution in rehearsals and in the editing room!  If we raise more than that we will reserve this money to help fund the next phase of the project!  That would be incredible.
We would be grateful for any contribution that you can make to this project.  A lot of little bits add up to one big bit.  
... if you are thinking about making a donation, we have a few perks to offer you:
For a $25.00 donation, you will be given recognition on the Alias Dance Project website.
For a $50.00 donation, you will be given recognition on the Alias Dance Project website and a trio of photographs taken in rehearsals of 'Restorative Structure'.
For a $100.00 donation, you will be given recognition on the Alias Dance Project website, a photo trio and two tickets to 'Makin' it happen: a funder', a party on October 19th at Trinity Video.  If your donation is made after October 19th, you will receive two tickets to Alias Dance Projects next fundraising event.
For a $250.00 donation, you will receive a personalized thank you video message from the team working on 'Restorative Structure', plus all of the perks listed above. 
The Impact
This is a milestone in our professional careers.  We are both inspired by each others mediums in our own creative practices and we have always wanted to work on an interactive dance/film project.  This is the first dance film that either of us have ever worked on.  Having the support of Reel Asian and a platform for our work to be seen is incredibly valuable.  We have built a meaningful working relationship with one another and have already been discussing all of the future projects we would like to work on.  This project is only the beginning, but beginnings are the most important piece of the puzzle.  
In addition to the professional development opportunity that this project has created for us, this project has also engaged:
4 Dance artists
1 Sound Designer
2 Film production assistants
In meaningful creative work.

<h3>Coastal Conservation Projects</h3>
<p>I'm Glyn Macey, a British artist, writer and fundraiser. I'm pretty well known for my work with organisations such as RNLI, UNICEF, National Trust and Greenpeace.</p>
<p>In 2017 I completed work on my most ambitious artistic venture to date: painting my way around the coast of Arctic Svalbard, documenting the wildlife and climate changes affecting one of the most fragile environments on the planet.</p>
<p>No stranger to demanding projects over the last six years, I have also painted my way across America from New York to Los Angeles for UNICEF, circumnavigated the English coast producing 180 original paintings en-route for RNLI and crisscrossed the UK filming the television series ‘A Brush with the Landscape’ for Sky Arts. The projects have now raised well over £100,000 for the benefitting charities.</p>
<p>I love to get as many people involved with my projects as possible and over the last decade, with the help of many beautiful people around the world we have helped some truly great causes.</p>
<p>This is where I need your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In a nutshell I need to raise £500 ($825) towards travel costs, but more importantly I want to get as many lovely folks involved as possible, it's much more fun for me that way! And in return I have a delectable range of juicy goodies for you including exclusive Limited Edition prints, Original artworks, Books and Vouchers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Result</h3>
<p>My goal is to paint 180 original artworks whilst traveling the English Coast, every one of which will be crafted into a set of signed limited edition prints helping to raise funds for one of the UK's leading environmental and coastal campaign charities Surfers Against Sewage and their PLASTIC FREE COMMUNITIES initiatives.</p>
<p>The year long trip will also see me deliver free demonstrations and talks to communities from Berwick upon Tweed to the Solway Firth (and everywhere in between!).</p>
<p>The project artworks and my travel writings will also be published as a set of three fully illustrated books.</p>

<b>THE SECRET CITY IS LOVE!</b> This is our annual fund-drive to support
 the powerful, transformational and inspiring work of the Obie-Award 
winning Secret City, a performance art ritual in NYC, LA and, as of this
 summer, Woodstock. We rely on individual contributions to keep our work
 alive. Please give at any level and receive some of the great, new swag
 we're making for next season to sell in our online store. You get it 
here first! If you've never been to one of our events, please read on

reading about the visions we have for the future.<br/><b><br/>BUT, WAIT, DIDN'T YOU HOLD YOUR ""LAST INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN EVER"" LAST YEAR?</b>
 Well, we thought so, seeing as we're now a big, ol, official non-profit
 BUT, it turns out that crowd funding is a really great way for us to 
raise money so we're gonna stick with it. There's some 
different accounting that takes place now that we're our own 501(c)3 - 
the money raised goes directly to our bank account and we provide our 
funders with tax write-offs directly.<br/><br/><b>BUT, WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</b> We’ve been holding our one-of-a-kind performances
in New York for 7 years, in LA for the past 2 years and, this summer we will
have our first Hudson Valley event in Woodstock. But what exactly is <i>it</i>? The Obie committee said back in
2010, “It’s a salon, it’s a celebration, it’s a show….a ceremony without any
dogma. A monthly event that builds connections among artists by offering them
sanctuary, humor, beauty, and wonder.”<br/></p><p><b>I CALL IT AN ARTISTIC TENT REVIVAL</b>: all are welcome, we celebrate the creative
spirit, and community is created on the spot. The events are pay-what-you-can

by a coffee hour with treats brought by community members. The events themselves
are joyful and deep; we practice a form of artistic mindfulness – asking people
to pay attention, to sing, to mingle, to look at what someone has made, to
watch performances, to participate in community interactions, and, to laugh
their asses off. <br/></p>
<p>The Secret City is special in that, aside from the

some of the visions for how we might grow and, because they say people really
like a plan with numbers, I’m going to call it <i>My 3 Vision Plan for the Future
of The Secret City</i>. VISION #1: <b>To take The Secret City to other cities</b> around
the country – Portland, Austin, San Francisco, Baltimore, Philadelphia,
Minneapolis, Chicago and more – you get the idea, an entire network of art
worshippers across the land. VISION #2: <b>A radio version
of The Secret City</b>, weekly on public radio: featuring live music, the Secret
City Singers, games and storytelling, meditation; the featured visual art would
be on our website so those listening at home could interact with the service as
it’s taking place. VISION #3: I want us to buy a place in the country, a retreat where we’ll
start <b>The Secret City Institute</b>: part think tank/part artist retreat/part
training center where people can learn what we do and how to do it in their own
town.</p>
<b>ALL OF THESE VISIONS ARE COMING TRUE</b> – they’re manifesting as you read
this right now. And they are made more powerful by being witnessed by all of you
– for they have left the isolated, mad chamber of my mind and reside in all of
your mad chambers now, too.<br/><br/><p>Visions, however, must be built on solid ground.
We must stabilize this organization. So, hold on, cuz I’m going to change it up
– now I'm going to call it <i>My 4 Vision
Plan</i>, and I’m going to move this to position #1. <b>We have to build
infrastructure</b>. We have a ton of really amazing volunteers – and we couldn’t
pull of what we do every month without them but, to really grow, we need a
staff. <br/></p>
<p><b>I'M GOING TO SHARE SOME NUMBERS WITH YOU:</b> Our
annual budget has hovered just below $75 grand for the last few years. This year, my aim is to meet
that budget and, to add another $50k to it – a $125,000 annual budget. What the
hell, let’s call that Vision #5! It's now a 5 Vision Plan! I’m getting crazy up in here!</p>
<p><b>BUT HOW CHRIS? HOW WILL WE MAKE THESE VISIONS COME TRUE?</b> First, we’re kicking off this online fund-drive – it’s called The Summer of
Love, cuz we’re all about love, and because we’re heading up to Woodstock this
summer. The goal of the online fund-drive is $30,000 raised over the next 45
days. I hope you’ll share the link with your friends, give generously and
spread the word. We have accomplished amazing things on a shoe-string! Imagine the future we are building together. We're also planning a party in LA in the fall - and we've just started writing grants. So, we've got things in the works.<br/></p><p>Creating The Secret City has made me a better

<h3>Latvija nepazūd, tas ir tikai sākums</h3>
<p>Sveiciens tev, lasītāj, šodienā! Es esmu Elīna, tāda vienkārša meitene no laukiem. Pirms vairāk nekā diviem gadiem es devos prom no Latvijas, lai pieredzētu nezināmo un ieskatītos savas dvēseles arhīvos. Kāpēc tas man bija tik svarīgi? Jo es ticu, ka pasaule var mainīties tikai tad, kad tu velti laiku sevis iepazīšanai. Katru dienu es atklāju jaunas patiesības par sevi un pasauli un to visu esmu aicināta tulkot mākslas valodā. Saku, ka aicināta, jo man ir sajūta, ka kāds augstāks spēks mani virza, un mana kontrole un loģika vairs nav primārais lēmumu pieņemšanas rīks.</p>
<p>Es zīmēju ģeometriskas konstelācijas un, gluži vai kā senie latvieši zīmēja rakstus un magnetizēja tos, es ļauju šiem simboliem ienākt pasaulē arī tetovējumu formā. Tetovēšanas procesā es izmantoju adatu (bez tetovēšanas mašīnas) un, veidojot tetovējumu, lieku punktu pie punkta. Tas ir roku darbs, ko mācos šeit, Hamburgā. Papildus tam, es attīstu gaismas valodas mākslu. Kas vēl ir svarīgi: mājās es nebraukšu viena. Ar mani brauks Svens, mans izredzētais, kuram ir brazīļu asinis. Viņš ir baigajā starā par šādu dzīves pavērsienu, jo grib darīt, būvēt, attīstīt vidi mums apkārt. Ģimene: tas ir darāmo darbu sarakstā.</p>
<p>Godīgi, man vienkārši ļoti gribas uz mājām. Dzīvot laukos un nodibināt mazu ģimenes uzņēmumu. Redzēt, cik mamma priecīga mirkļos, kad viņa var darīt to, kas vislabāk padodas. Ieklausīties vecmammas padomos. Sajust atkal īstu zemi zem kājām. Vasaras naktī ēst upenes no krūma. Auklēt savus bērnus vidē, kurā uzaugām mēs. Man ilgu laiku ir licies, ka Latvija lēnām pazūd, bet tā ir ilūzija, no kuras es mostos, un es spēju to atzīt. Es beidzot esmu gatava būt tur, ar jaunām idejām un pārliecību, ka arī nekurienē var tapt lielas lietas.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Nopirkt automašīnu, atbraukt uz mājām un turpināt radīt</h3>
<p>Lai nokļūtu Latvijā, mums<strong> </strong><strong>ir nepieciešama automašīna. </strong>Lai es varētu izveidot savu mazo <strong>mākslas studiju</strong>, man ir nepieciešams <strong>pamatkapitāls</strong>. Tādai absolūtai caurredzamībai: uz Vāciju es neatbraucu pelnīt lielo piķi. Arī šeit, Hamburgā, es vēlējos būt maksimāli brīva, bet tas maksā. Pirmkārt, dzīvokļu īres cenas šeit ir pamatīgi gaisā, otrkārt, visiem ir jāmaksā obligātā veselības apdrošināšana. Ja tu esi pašnodarbinātais, maksā no sava maka divsimt eiro mēnesī. Kāpēc es to pieminu - tradicionālā medicīna nav mans jājamzirdziņš, un šo naudu es varētu ieguldīt savos mākslas projektos. Es sapratu, ka mana eksistence šeit absolūti nav rentabla, un mana dzīve ir kā  uz adatām.  </p>
<p>Šo gadu laikā es esmu pilnveidojusi sevi un attīstījusi savas prasmes, un sākusi būvēt dzīvi tādu, kādu man ir prieks dzīvot. Ar savu dzīves uztveri es esmu iedvesmojusi daudzus, kas ir saņēmuši manu mākslu, ģeometriskus personalizētus dizainus un tetovējumus. Es radu ar nodomu, un man ir svarīgi sadzirdēt otra cilvēka stāstu. Reizēm pietiek ar skatienu vien, lai ienirtu otra dzīlēs. Mani dizaini ir aizceļojuši uz dažādām pasaules valstīm Eiropā un Amerikā. Pagājušā gada laikā es paspēju uztetovēt desmitiem simbolisku tetovējumu, kas kalpo kā spēcinoši amuleti.  Šogad es pārdevu savu pirmo fizisko gaismas valodas mākslas darbu. Papildus veicu arī dažādus grafikas dizaina darbus (logotipu izstrāde, promo materiālu dizains u.c.), tomēr šobrīd izvēlos fokusēties uz savu unikālo mākslas izpausmi, jo es zinu, ka tas ir kaut kas īpašs.</p>
<p>Es strādāju no mājām, bet mana auditorija nav tikai un vienīgi lokāla. Mans mērķis: atvērt studiju/kafejnīcu Baltinavā. Lai vai cik jocīgi tas neizklausītos, bet, manuprāt, Latvija šodien ir izbraukājama vienā dienā. Galu galā — kas ir 4 stundu brauciens salīdzinājumā ar tetovējumu uz visu tavu dzīvi? Globalizācijas un digitalizācijas laikā cilvēki ir pieraduši visu saņemt pēc iespējas ātrāk, bet tas nav tas, kā es vēlos strādāt. Manās acīs vērtība ir ne tikai sasniegtais rezultāts, bet pats process. Nesteidzīgs, baudāms.  Veids, kā es tetovēju, ir pieredze, kuru vēlos piesātināt ar iespaidiem par lauku burvību. Mans tētis, aizejot citā pasaulē, laukos atstājis ļoti daudz rīkus un materiālus, kuri bez vīrieša zelta rokām pazūd. Savukārt Svens prot metināt, labot mehāniku un pat uzcelt māju, ja vajag. Plāni ir lieli, bet, lai turpinātu, mums abiem ir jābūt Latvijā fiziski. </p>

<div>
<p>Lielu daļu savas dzīves es esmu ticējusi, ka Latvijā kaut ko sasniegt nav iespējams. Jā un nē — atkarībā no tā, kas ir sasniegums tavā personīgajā izpratnē. Jā, protams, apstākļi māksliniekam šeit nav paši labvēlīgākie, bet ir jāatceras, ka pašā augšgalā ir cilvēka griba un Augstākie Spēki (sauc to par Visuma spēku, Dievu vai kā citādi), viss pārējais pakārtojas. Mans lielākais izaicinājums ir iemiesot manu mākslinieka būtību un apgāzt priekšstatus par to, ka mākslinieks (jebkādā radošajā formā) nav īsta profesija un ar to neko nevar nopelnīt. Var. Ne vien man ir šāda misija, bet arī latviešiem kopumā: iemiesot savus talantus, atklāt spējas, kas dzirksteļo un ceļ sabiedrību. Pajautā sev: kāda jēga katru dienu iet uz darbu, kas neiegriež tavu enerģiju, beigās knapi savilkt galus un pa virsu tam nejust sevi savā ķermenī? Es izvēlos dzīvot citādāk un nojaukt robežas starp pieņemtajām normām un bezgalīgo cilvēka potenciālu.</p>

<h3>Pateicībā dot atpakaļ</h3>
<p>Tuvojas mana dzimšanas diena 17. martā, un šogad mana lielākā dāvana ir būšana mājās. Mūsu mērķis ir <i>9 000 eiro: automašīnai, ceļa izdevumiem un manas radošās darbības pamatkapitālam Latvijā.</i> Izklausās riktīgi daudz. Rakstu šo skaitli, un piezogas kauns. Tomēr, es nebaidos prasīt atbalstu, jo zinu, ko es daru un kāpēc es to daru. Mans mērķis ir cēls un tīrs. Iegūstot šādu summu, <i>es vēlos pateicībā dot atpakaļ (pie katras summas ir minēts pakalpojums, kuru piedāvāju tev, neaizmirsti izlasīt arī aprakstu)  </i>Lai arī cik liels skaitlis beigās tas būs, nauda tiks ieguldīta jau iepriekš minētajos plānos.  Lēmums ir pieņemts — mēs dzīvosim Latvijā.</p>

<p>Elīna </p>
</div></div>","Latvija nepazūd, tas ir tikai sākums
Sveiciens tev, lasītāj, šodienā! Es esmu Elīna, tāda vienkārša meitene no laukiem. Pirms vairāk nekā diviem gadiem es devos prom no Latvijas, lai pieredzētu nezināmo un ieskatītos savas dvēseles arhīvos. Kāpēc tas man bija tik svarīgi? Jo es ticu, ka pasaule var mainīties tikai tad, kad tu velti laiku sevis iepazīšanai. Katru dienu es atklāju jaunas patiesības par sevi un pasauli un to visu esmu aicināta tulkot mākslas valodā. Saku, ka aicināta, jo man ir sajūta, ka kāds augstāks spēks mani virza, un mana kontrole un loģika vairs nav primārais lēmumu pieņemšanas rīks.
Es zīmēju ģeometriskas konstelācijas un, gluži vai kā senie latvieši zīmēja rakstus un magnetizēja tos, es ļauju šiem simboliem ienākt pasaulē arī tetovējumu formā. Tetovēšanas procesā es izmantoju adatu (bez tetovēšanas mašīnas) un, veidojot tetovējumu, lieku punktu pie punkta. Tas ir roku darbs, ko mācos šeit, Hamburgā. Papildus tam, es attīstu gaismas valodas mākslu. Kas vēl ir svarīgi: mājās es nebraukšu viena. Ar mani brauks Svens, mans izredzētais, kuram ir brazīļu asinis. Viņš ir baigajā starā par šādu dzīves pavērsienu, jo grib darīt, būvēt, attīstīt vidi mums apkārt. Ģimene: tas ir darāmo darbu sarakstā.
Godīgi, man vienkārši ļoti gribas uz mājām. Dzīvot laukos un nodibināt mazu ģimenes uzņēmumu. Redzēt, cik mamma priecīga mirkļos, kad viņa var darīt to, kas vislabāk padodas. Ieklausīties vecmammas padomos. Sajust atkal īstu zemi zem kājām. Vasaras naktī ēst upenes no krūma. Auklēt savus bērnus vidē, kurā uzaugām mēs. Man ilgu laiku ir licies, ka Latvija lēnām pazūd, bet tā ir ilūzija, no kuras es mostos, un es spēju to atzīt. Es beidzot esmu gatava būt tur, ar jaunām idejām un pārliecību, ka arī nekurienē var tapt lielas lietas.
 

Nopirkt automašīnu, atbraukt uz mājām un turpināt radīt
Lai nokļūtu Latvijā, mums ir nepieciešama automašīna. Lai es varētu izveidot savu mazo mākslas studiju, man ir nepieciešams pamatkapitāls. Tādai absolūtai caurredzamībai: uz Vāciju es neatbraucu pelnīt lielo piķi. Arī šeit, Hamburgā, es vēlējos būt maksimāli brīva, bet tas maksā. Pirmkārt, dzīvokļu īres cenas šeit ir pamatīgi gaisā, otrkārt, visiem ir jāmaksā obligātā veselības apdrošināšana. Ja tu esi pašnodarbinātais, maksā no sava maka divsimt eiro mēnesī. Kāpēc es to pieminu - tradicionālā medicīna nav mans jājamzirdziņš, un šo naudu es varētu ieguldīt savos mākslas projektos. Es sapratu, ka mana eksistence šeit absolūti nav rentabla, un mana dzīve ir kā  uz adatām.  
Šo gadu laikā es esmu pilnveidojusi sevi un attīstījusi savas prasmes, un sākusi būvēt dzīvi tādu, kādu man ir prieks dzīvot. Ar savu dzīves uztveri es esmu iedvesmojusi daudzus, kas ir saņēmuši manu mākslu, ģeometriskus personalizētus dizainus un tetovējumus. Es radu ar nodomu, un man ir svarīgi sadzirdēt otra cilvēka stāstu. Reizēm pietiek ar skatienu vien, lai ienirtu otra dzīlēs. Mani dizaini ir aizceļojuši uz dažādām pasaules valstīm Eiropā un Amerikā. Pagājušā gada laikā es paspēju uztetovēt desmitiem simbolisku tetovējumu, kas kalpo kā spēcinoši amuleti.  Šogad es pārdevu savu pirmo fizisko gaismas valodas mākslas darbu.

<h2>GIRL ON CANVAS </h2>
<p><strong><em>Girl on Canvas </em></strong><strong>is an artbook project by Pola Dwurnik. It will be a book about painting and its reception. It will show a new life of Dwurnik’s paintings, one completely uncontorlled by the artist – life born in the imagination of 30 outstanding personalities, e.g.: Ruth Mitchell, Denise Grollmus, Andreas Blaettler, Olga Tokarczuk, Joanna Erbel, Piotr Lachmann.</strong></p>
<p>The book is both openly personal and bravely intimate. Subversive, rascally and girlish. A subtle riot.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>EXCERPTS FROM THE BOOK</h2>
<p><em>At first I try to silence them, to control them just as I’ve always tried to repress myself underneath. I try to speak in whisper to them, but they only grow stronger, start flashing more intensely, it’s unstoppable. And then I give up, let them keep firing off, let them keep exploding, let them keep twinkling across the flame colour spectrum</em>. - from the text of Agata Araszkiewicz, <em>Blowballs, Kites…</em></p>
<p><em>You have to inhale air and smoke deep into your lungs and then slowly change them into thoughts, conceptions, and theories. The more complicated, the better—the more impressive the names the theories get and the more effect they have on people. For instance, you have to come up with ways of imagining the unimaginable, you have to create the most entangled and inherently contradictory mental states, and you have to combine separate emotions into intricate complexes and syndromes—and then you can ponder and attempt to cure them, and explicate, express, and interpret them</em>. - from the text of Olga Tokarczuk, <em>Pola Dwurnik, The School of Smoking, Or a Concert in a Cave</em></p>
<p><em>I liked the piece, because it made me think of a refuge. I have a balcony overgrown with creepers, fruit bushes and a few flowers. When I sit or crouch there, I am cut off from the world, hidden, tightly surrounded by my green jungle, and when I stand up, I am bathed in light and visible (...). The figure in the painting is about to stand up, to enter a stage watched with anxiety, hurriedly painting her nails. The artist has entitled his painting </em><em>The Paintress</em><em>, which I suspect is self-ironic, especially that Pola Dwurnik’s work is often autobiographica</em>l. - from the text of Jerzy Szygiel, <em>The Paintress</em>’s Luggage</p>

</div></span></div>","GIRL ON CANVAS 
Girl on Canvas is an artbook project by Pola Dwurnik. It will be a book about painting and its reception. It will show a new life of Dwurnik’s paintings, one completely uncontorlled by the artist – life born in the imagination of 30 outstanding personalities, e.g.: Ruth Mitchell, Denise Grollmus, Andreas Blaettler, Olga Tokarczuk, Joanna Erbel, Piotr Lachmann.
The book is both openly personal and bravely intimate. Subversive, rascally and girlish. A subtle riot.
 
EXCERPTS FROM THE BOOK
At first I try to silence them, to control them just as I’ve always tried to repress myself underneath. I try to speak in whisper to them, but they only grow stronger, start flashing more intensely, it’s unstoppable. And then I give up, let them keep firing off, let them keep exploding, let them keep twinkling across the flame colour spectrum. - from the text of Agata Araszkiewicz, Blowballs, Kites…
You have to inhale air and smoke deep into your lungs and then slowly change them into thoughts, conceptions, and theories. The more complicated, the better—the more impressive the names the theories get and the more effect they have on people. For instance, you have to come up with ways of imagining the unimaginable, you have to create the most entangled and inherently contradictory mental states, and you have to combine separate emotions into intricate complexes and syndromes—and then you can ponder and attempt to cure them, and explicate, express, and interpret them. - from the text of Olga Tokarczuk, Pola Dwurnik, The School of Smoking, Or a Concert in a Cave
I liked the piece, because it made me think of a refuge. I have a balcony overgrown with creepers, fruit bushes and a few flowers. When I sit or crouch there, I am cut off from the world, hidden, tightly surrounded by my green jungle, and when I stand up, I am bathed in light and visible (...). The figure in the painting is about to stand up, to enter a stage watched with anxiety, hurriedly painting her nails. The artist has entitled his painting The Paintress, which I suspect is self-ironic, especially that Pola Dwurnik’s work is often autobiographical. - from the text of Jerzy Szygiel, The Paintress’s Luggage
 

GRAPHIC DESIGN
The book-object received its form from MOONMADNESS– Dagny and Daniel Szwed, the designers of numerous beautiful publications, including this year’s catalogue for the Polish exhibition at the Venice Biennale.
THE BOOK WILL BE A POLISH&ENGLISH PUBLICATION

Using the testimony of a Palmach commander, which provides me with an outline of the pre-1948 map, I attempt to locate these villages, or what remains of them.

<h3><span>Ruins and abandonded structures </span></h3>
<p><span>I always had a strong curiosity about ruins and architectural remains. That's no wonder, as Berlin in the late 1960s was a place where you could easily spot the scars and empty sites, resulting from WWII. Yet as a child, we crawled through bunkers and ruins, collected cartridges, rusted helmets and handguns, drilled bullets and shell splinters out of walls and tried to sense the smell of history and what had happened in these places, when they were still inhabited and animated.<br/> Decades later, when the Berlin wall came down, this curiosity hadn’t subsided and I strolled through countless barracks and Plattenbauten which had been recently abandoned. Unfortunately, I didn’t photograph at that time, but the pictures stayed in my head. </span></p>
<p><span>It took more than another decade, when a friend took me for a visit to Wünsdorf, a vast military area from the time of WWI, which had been the headquarters of the Red Army in Western Europe. As a kid who grew up in times of the Cold War, this was quite fascinating to see and it really propelled the imagination. What I saw there led to the strong impulse to take out the camera and capture the locations. As usual with my sense of exaggeration, this led to consequently discovering all related remains of historic impact around Berlin. The then mostly forgotten Olympic Village from 1936, military airfields, barracks, forgotten sanatoriums and even the listening post atop Teufelsberg</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/964876/pictures/full/20130802125527-_DSC9525_29_3.JPG?1375473332"" src="""" style="""" title=""Theatre Hall, Wünsdorf""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Four-legged survivors </strong></h3>
<p><span>The next years I was chasing around, looking for abandoned structures - preferably of historic interest - which contained a space that would have an impact on me. I mostly found these in abandoned sanatoriums and theatre halls where I could easily sense the “Genius Loci”. </span></p>
<p><span>When I visited an abandoned power plant from the early 30s, I unexpectedly came across a single yellow chair, just standing there, like a last sign of previous life, which could give future archaeologists a hint of the former inhabitants. Somehow this chair helped me inhabit and structure the space to not get totally lost - in space and mind. And from then on I was determined to find a chair everywhere I went. Strangely enough, even if structures had been completely stripped off, you could always find a chair - nothing else, but chairs remained.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/964869/pictures/full/20130802125256-_DSC7107_11_3.JPG?1375473181"" src="""" style="""" title=""Therapeutical Pool, Hohenlychen""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Object of desire</h3>
<p><span>Important to me was the rediscovery of Lacan’s theorem of the “Object small a”, which made me realize, that these chairs were the substitute for my “unattainable object of desire” and symbolized my fear of photographing real, living people, as much as the ruins stood for my own life at that time. It then became clear to me what drove me, and I knew I needed to get out of this, but still kept pursuing this project like a maniac. I felt I had to ride it out to the end, and finally did.</span></p>
<p><span>When I came across the term <em>Sede Vacante</em> (vacant seat / vacant site), which  signifies the interim period after a pope has died and his successor is in charge, I was instantly struck with the multiple meaning of it. Even more, as it fuelled my predilection for wordplay.</span></p>

<h3> </h3></span></div>","Ruins and abandonded structures 
I always had a strong curiosity about ruins and architectural remains. That's no wonder, as Berlin in the late 1960s was a place where you could easily spot the scars and empty sites, resulting from WWII. Yet as a child, we crawled through bunkers and ruins, collected cartridges, rusted helmets and handguns, drilled bullets and shell splinters out of walls and tried to sense the smell of history and what had happened in these places, when they were still inhabited and animated. Decades later, when the Berlin wall came down, this curiosity hadn’t subsided and I strolled through countless barracks and Plattenbauten which had been recently abandoned. Unfortunately, I didn’t photograph at that time, but the pictures stayed in my head. 
It took more than another decade, when a friend took me for a visit to Wünsdorf, a vast military area from the time of WWI, which had been the headquarters of the Red Army in Western Europe. As a kid who grew up in times of the Cold War, this was quite fascinating to see and it really propelled the imagination. What I saw there led to the strong impulse to take out the camera and capture the locations. As usual with my sense of exaggeration, this led to consequently discovering all related remains of historic impact around Berlin. The then mostly forgotten Olympic Village from 1936, military airfields, barracks, forgotten sanatoriums and even the listening post atop Teufelsberg
 

 
Four-legged survivors 
The next years I was chasing around, looking for abandoned structures - preferably of historic interest - which contained a space that would have an impact on me. I mostly found these in abandoned sanatoriums and theatre halls where I could easily sense the “Genius Loci”. 
When I visited an abandoned power plant from the early 30s, I unexpectedly came across a single yellow chair, just standing there, like a last sign of previous life, which could give future archaeologists a hint of the former inhabitants. Somehow this chair helped me inhabit and structure the space to not get totally lost - in space and mind. And from then on I was determined to find a chair everywhere I went. Strangely enough, even if structures had been completely stripped off, you could always find a chair - nothing else, but chairs remained.
 

 
Object of desire
Important to me was the rediscovery of Lacan’s theorem of the “Object small a”, which made me realize, that these chairs were the substitute for my “unattainable object of desire” and symbolized my fear of photographing real, living people, as much as the ruins stood for my own life at that time. It then became clear to me what drove me, and I knew I needed to get out of this, but still kept pursuing this project like a maniac. I felt I had to ride it out to the end, and finally did.
When I came across the term Sede Vacante (vacant seat / vacant site), which  signifies the interim period after a pope has died and his successor is in charge, I was instantly struck with the multiple meaning of it. Even more, as it fuelled my predilection for wordplay.
Now, a couple of years later there only remains the need to make a book which bends the chaos left by the past into something meaningful, the final statement in a working process. And because of this, I regard this work rather as a depiction of a state of mind, than an exact mapping of historical sites. And that's precisely the point, that distinguishes this project from others dealing with abandoned places.

Some months ago, I was approached by Rob van Hoesel, the noted designer and co-founder of The Eriskay Connection, an independent publishing house in the Netherlands, asking why these pictures hadn't been published yet. I replied, who should dare to publish this series? and he answered dryly: me.

</h3><p>OUR STORY</p>
<p>We are in an
exciting phase !<br/></p>
<p>Pepatian has performance
and film projects that are ready to be presented at other communities and need
additional support to create marketing materials in order to reach those
communities in the college/university, high school and community centers. We are also asking for support to launch an archival and documentation project to make existing video materials
more accessible. </p>
<p>Projects include:</p>
<p>1) BRONX HIP-HOP
ACADEMY</p>
<p>Teaching artists:
Rokafella, Caridad De La Luz/La Bruja, Toofly, DP One, and Fred Sepulveda</p>
<p>We are in the middle
of a magical year at BronxWorks. <br/></p><p>Our workshop series culminates in a final
performance to friends, families and supporters. We are ready to explore taking
the Hip-Hop Academy to other young people.<span>  Your support will help pay for design and photographer fees
to help us make beautiful materials ! As well as pay for zip-up lightweight tops for staff to wear
at the concluding performance. ($600) </span></p>
<p>2) SHADOW LANDS</p>
<p>Collaborating
artists: Caridad De La Luz/La Bruja (poet and singer) and Cynthia Paniagua
(dancer)</p>
<p>Shadow Lands is a collaboration that explores feminine prowess and vulnerabilities
through a surreal navigation of the female psyche, released
through movement, music, comedy and poetry.
<br/></p><p>The artists
premiered the work at Pregones Theater in June 2013 and are preparing to work
with artist and choreographer Teresa Hernandez in Puerto Rico this summer to
create another presentation on la isla. The artists are working on strengthening the work so its ready to engage with other communities.<span> 
Your support will help pay for photographer and design fees for a
brochure that will outline the performance project and also workshops that the collaborating
artists can provide to young people. ($300)</span></p>
<p>3) OUT OF LA
NEGRURA/Out of Blackness</p>
<p>Collaborating
artist: Sita Frederick, Ana “Rokafella” Garcia, Marion Ramirez</p>
<p>Film Editor: Naeema
Jamilah</p>
<p>Out of La
Negrura/Out of Blackness will be a 40-minute documentary film based on a dance
theater project created over five years which explored
Caribbean/Latina-American experience through dance. Emerging film editor Naeema
Jamilah is sculpting the work into an engaging interplay of live clips and
interviews with the performing artists. She has completed a rough draft of 10minutes
and will be working on the remainder over Summer 2014.</p>
<p>Our aim is to create
a strong and engaging film that could also serve as a platform for the artists
to offer workshops and performances as well as audience discussions about
making the work. The film increases the potential to reach and inspire
audiences in other locations and supports the potential for the artists to tour
with the film.</p>
<p>The intended
audience is college and universities with Dance, Hip-Hop, as well as
Cultural/Performance/Latino-American/Caribbean/Women/Urban Studies
Departments.<span>  Additionally the film
could also be shown at high schools and community centers. Your support will
help pay design fees to pull together the marketing “look” of the
documentary.  ($300)</span></p>
<p>4) PEPATIAN ARCHIVES</p>
<p>Pepatian has a
backlog of VHS tapes of previous performances that need to be transferred to
DVD. We are going to begin collaborating with a media expert who has the equipment and experience to help
transfer and organize the years of documentary material. Your support will help
us launch the first phase of this archival project. ($300).</p>
<p>THE IMPACT</p>
<p>These projects are
very important to the artists involved and to Pepatian’s ability to engage with
other communities within and outside of the Bronx, New York.<span>  Your support with our efforts to produce
strong materials will help us gain the attention of the college and university

We are in an
exciting phase !
Pepatian has performance
and film projects that are ready to be presented at other communities and need
additional support to create marketing materials in order to reach those
communities in the college/university, high school and community centers. We are also asking for support to launch an archival and documentation project to make existing video materials
more accessible. 
Projects include:
1) BRONX HIP-HOP
ACADEMY
Teaching artists:
Rokafella, Caridad De La Luz/La Bruja, Toofly, DP One, and Fred Sepulveda
We are in the middle
of a magical year at BronxWorks. Our workshop series culminates in a final
performance to friends, families and supporters. We are ready to explore taking
the Hip-Hop Academy to other young people.  Your support will help pay for design and photographer fees
to help us make beautiful materials ! As well as pay for zip-up lightweight tops for staff to wear
at the concluding performance. ($600) 
2) SHADOW LANDS
Collaborating
artists: Caridad De La Luz/La Bruja (poet and singer) and Cynthia Paniagua
(dancer)
Shadow Lands is a collaboration that explores feminine prowess and vulnerabilities
through a surreal navigation of the female psyche, released
through movement, music, comedy and poetry.
The artists
premiered the work at Pregones Theater in June 2013 and are preparing to work
with artist and choreographer Teresa Hernandez in Puerto Rico this summer to
create another presentation on la isla. The artists are working on strengthening the work so its ready to engage with other communities. 
Your support will help pay for photographer and design fees for a
brochure that will outline the performance project and also workshops that the collaborating
artists can provide to young people. ($300)
3) OUT OF LA
NEGRURA/Out of Blackness
Collaborating
artist: Sita Frederick, Ana “Rokafella” Garcia, Marion Ramirez
Film Editor: Naeema
Jamilah
Out of La
Negrura/Out of Blackness will be a 40-minute documentary film based on a dance
theater project created over five years which explored
Caribbean/Latina-American experience through dance. Emerging film editor Naeema
Jamilah is sculpting the work into an engaging interplay of live clips and
interviews with the performing artists. She has completed a rough draft of 10minutes
and will be working on the remainder over Summer 2014.
Our aim is to create
a strong and engaging film that could also serve as a platform for the artists
to offer workshops and performances as well as audience discussions about
making the work. The film increases the potential to reach and inspire
audiences in other locations and supports the potential for the artists to tour
with the film.
The intended
audience is college and universities with Dance, Hip-Hop, as well as
Cultural/Performance/Latino-American/Caribbean/Women/Urban Studies
Departments.  Additionally the film
could also be shown at high schools and community centers. Your support will
help pay design fees to pull together the marketing “look” of the
documentary.  ($300)
4) PEPATIAN ARCHIVES
Pepatian has a
backlog of VHS tapes of previous performances that need to be transferred to
DVD. We are going to begin collaborating with a media expert who has the equipment and experience to help
transfer and organize the years of documentary material. Your support will help
us launch the first phase of this archival project. ($300).
THE IMPACT
These projects are
very important to the artists involved and to Pepatian’s ability to engage with
other communities within and outside of the Bronx, New York.  Your support with our efforts to produce
strong materials will help us gain the attention of the college and university
markets, as well as local high schools and community centers for potential
future gigs and touring.

On the 21st we loaded up Big Red (1996 Dodge Ram 2500 8L V10) with our art, The Supreme Ultimate, and headed out to BRC. The drive down was exuberant with excitement building for the burn, our art and the stories we would bring back home. The burn went great, we erected our art over the weekend. The rest of the week was spent exploring, making new friends, and enjoying the burn to the fullest extent. The morning of the 30th, we burned The Supreme Ultimate at sunrise and that afternoon we packed camp into Big Red and headed out that night. Big Red was a strong runner, tough as a team of mules, and ready to tackle any big job. Little did we know that Big Red was ready to call it quits. We headed north on 447, it was late and we settled in for a long drive back to Tri-Cities, WA, about 9 hours away. </p>
<p>60 Miles into the journey Big Red was starting to make strange noises. We pulled over and found a loose wire on the battery and thought that might be the issue. We managed to get it running again with the batteries used to power lights for The Supreme Ultimate and a length of speaker wire (Radical Self-Reliance at its best). We traveled down the road another 7 or so miles when Big Red started to overheat and started making sounds that no engine should make. We pulled off to the side of 447 as best we could and lifted the hood to find an enormous amount of coolant and oil spewed every which way.. After an hour or so of desperation and helplessness, a wonderful couple of burners from Vancouver, BC, stopped and offered to help. They drove me into Cedarville in which I could finally get cell phone coverage and managed to procure a tow truck from Alturas, CA. </p>
<p>I finally made it back to the Big Red and my stranded friends about 2.5 hours later where I found them eating Pickles and drinking Capt'n Morgan.. We got Big Red loaded and towed him back to Alturas. Every hotel in town was booked. An angel appeared in the shape of a Tow Truck Driver. Alan from Pioneer Auto invited us to his house where he lets us bunk in his 5th wheel and offered us showers and coffee in the morning. We went to the garage where we jumped Big Red. Alan immediately noted the gurgling of the coolant into the overflow reservoir, more than likely a cracked head or a blown head gasket.  </p>
<p>Around noon, I managed to get my folks to drive down from WA State to pick all of us up. No garages would be open until after the Labor Day holiday and we had to get home to the default world to take care of our families and jobs. We left Big Red in Cali and drove home reaching Tri-Cities at 3am on Monday morning. This morning, Tuesday the 2nd of Sept I received a call from Ronnie at Ron Campbell Automotive that Big Red has biten the dust and is in need of a new engine.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p>Breakdown of what is needed:</p> <ul>
<li>Used/Rebuilt Engine - Ronnie has found one from a reputable company that has around 80k miles on it for $2000.</li> <li>Shop charges - Ron will charge us $1500 to install the engine.</li>
<li>Travel Expenses - $700 To get back down to Alturas, CA to pick-up Big Red and pay for fuel to get Big Red home. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>“Wooden Wars” – a
new multilingual play about Polish-Jewish relationships by Jana Mazurkiewicz</b></p>
<p>During my
academic studies I developed a strong interest in the “rejected daughter of
Jewish culture” - Yiddish theatre. I would like to contribute to its rich
tradition by staging a multilingual play that I wrote, The main language of the play is
Yiddish, in addition to English and Polish. The title of the play is “Wooden
Wars” and it comments on Polish-Jewish relationships in contemporary Poland. </p>
<p>As a Yiddishist,
I am devoted to rescuing the dying Yiddish language and culture. I would like
to demonstrate that Yiddish can be revived not only in academia but also in the
arts. I also strive to encourage a discussion about a revival of Yiddish as a
stage language and as a mean of exploring the current state of Polish-Jewish
relationships. I expect to attract audiences from a wide range of backgrounds:
Polish, Polish-American, Jewish, non-Jewish, general theatre enthusiasts, and
students of the University of Michigan.</p><p>
</p><p><b>The Story </b></p>
<p>“Wooden Wars” focuses on
the lives of four young Catholics from modern Poland, each of whom changes
forever when they discover that they might have Jewish roots. Sisters Zosia and
Ania separate as one travels to America, converts to reform Judaism, and
embraces her lesbian sexuality, while the other stays behind in Poland and marries
a <i>Chabadnik</i>. Both come to speak Yiddish at home. Their stories are intertwined
with those of their friends Jakub and Tadek, two young men whose own
relationships with Jewish identity and Yiddish language are troubled. Neither
as children nor as adults do the characters have control of their fates.
Various paranormal forces are involved in the action, and Jesus appears to
sings in Yiddish.</p>
<p><b>The Title</b></p>
<p>The title “Wooden Wars” refers to
a cultural battle in contemporary Poland that’s highlighted in the play by two
symbolic wooden artifacts: wooden crosses, and wooden figurines of Jews. These figurines, made
of wood or clay, are a part of contemporary Polish culture. People buy them as
amulets believing that they will bring happiness to their households. This article
explains their meaning: <a href=""http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/hey-poland-whats-up-with-those-lucky-jew-statues"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/hey-poland-whats-up-with-those-lucky-jew-statues</a></p>
<p><b>The Languages </b></p>
<p>“Wooden Wars” starts in English
and Polish, but gradually includes more Yiddish so that by the second act
almost all of the performance is in Yiddish. This structure asks us to reflect:
Is Yiddish the key to understanding the Polish-Jewish past? For the audience’s
ease, an English translation will also be projected as subtitles.</p><b>

Main goals of the project</b><br/><br/>• Initiating the collaboration between different communities at the University of Michigan<br/>• Promoting creativity in Yiddish<br/>• Encouraging people to involve in the arts<br/>• Enhancing Polish–Jewish dialogue<br/><br/>The $5000 I raise is needed to stage the play (at least 4 performances) in a fully professional way and to record it on video. <p></p><p><b>Your contribution goes towards:</b></p><ul>

new multilingual play about Polish-Jewish relationships by Jana Mazurkiewicz
During my
academic studies I developed a strong interest in the “rejected daughter of
Jewish culture” - Yiddish theatre. I would like to contribute to its rich
tradition by staging a multilingual play that I wrote, The main language of the play is
Yiddish, in addition to English and Polish. The title of the play is “Wooden
Wars” and it comments on Polish-Jewish relationships in contemporary Poland. 
As a Yiddishist,
I am devoted to rescuing the dying Yiddish language and culture. I would like
to demonstrate that Yiddish can be revived not only in academia but also in the
arts. I also strive to encourage a discussion about a revival of Yiddish as a
stage language and as a mean of exploring the current state of Polish-Jewish
relationships. I expect to attract audiences from a wide range of backgrounds:
Polish, Polish-American, Jewish, non-Jewish, general theatre enthusiasts, and
students of the University of Michigan.
The Story 
“Wooden Wars” focuses on
the lives of four young Catholics from modern Poland, each of whom changes
forever when they discover that they might have Jewish roots. Sisters Zosia and
Ania separate as one travels to America, converts to reform Judaism, and
embraces her lesbian sexuality, while the other stays behind in Poland and marries
a Chabadnik. Both come to speak Yiddish at home. Their stories are intertwined
with those of their friends Jakub and Tadek, two young men whose own
relationships with Jewish identity and Yiddish language are troubled. Neither
as children nor as adults do the characters have control of their fates.
Various paranormal forces are involved in the action, and Jesus appears to
sings in Yiddish.
The Title
The title “Wooden Wars” refers to
a cultural battle in contemporary Poland that’s highlighted in the play by two
symbolic wooden artifacts: wooden crosses, and wooden figurines of Jews. These figurines, made
of wood or clay, are a part of contemporary Polish culture. People buy them as
amulets believing that they will bring happiness to their households. This article
explains their meaning: http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/hey-poland-whats-up-with-those-lucky-jew-statues
The Languages 
“Wooden Wars” starts in English
and Polish, but gradually includes more Yiddish so that by the second act
almost all of the performance is in Yiddish. This structure asks us to reflect:
Is Yiddish the key to understanding the Polish-Jewish past? For the audience’s
ease, an English translation will also be projected as subtitles.

Main goals of the project• Initiating the collaboration between different communities at the University of Michigan• Promoting creativity in Yiddish• Encouraging people to involve in the arts• Enhancing Polish–Jewish dialogueThe $5000 I raise is needed to stage the play (at least 4 performances) in a fully professional way and to record it on video. Your contribution goes towards:

<p><b>THORBIRD'S ART</b></p><p>
</p><p>Less than a
year ago, it was discovered that Richard possesses a treasure trove of over 150
paintings dating back to the mid-60′s thru the
late 70′s.  His exquisite art seems as
if pulled from a time-capsule, yet the imagery somehow remains contemporary.
 This revelation makes the re-introduction of Richard Thorbird to the art
world and the 21st century thrilling for us and the inevitable next step in helping to save his home<b>.</b>  We
could not be more proud or excited to present these hidden gems to the public for the first time.</p>
<p>Born in
1937, Richard Thorstenson (A.K.A. Thor, Thorbird, Ricardo Montalblonde or just
Montalblonde) is originally from Duluth, Minnesota. With a degree in Art from
the University of Minnesota, Richard packed up his 1940 Chevy hot-rod and
headed west to Topanga Canyon at the beginning of the counter-cultural
revolution. Over the following decade and half, amidst the bohemian enclave of
artists gathering in Southern California, Thorbird made hundreds of paintings,
scraping together a living by selling them to friends, celebrities, and local
characters straight from his home. We believe they embody not only the unique
vision of a genuine talent, but the essence of California’s golden age, and its
spirit of creative, sexual, and psychedelic discovery.</p>
<p><b>THE DRIVE TO
SAVE THORBIRD'S HOME</b></p>
<p>Richard's
home in Topanga Canyon is in foreclosure due to a series of unfortunate events
(none of which Richard will allow himself to feel victimized by). Richard is 78
years old, has no family, and is isolated from the world because of his age and
poor health. Without family or funds, if he doesn’t come up with $17,500
by April 30th, he will become homeless and will quite literally lose
everything. The bank will repossess Richard’s small home and take away a
lifetime of earnest hard work and creativity.</p>
<p>We’re making
this effort and doing what we’re doing because Richard is one of us and, quite
simply, <i>he is worth it</i>.  We firmly believe that as a society, we
must continue to place value on special individuals like Richard who inspire us
creatively <i>and</i>  as human beings.  We are all in this effort
together, as a group of young artists, and are rallying to help him raise this
money.  Richard’s struggle is not unique, <i>but he is</i> -- we truly
appreciate the gold he shares and reflects back to us all. </p>
<p><b>THE FUTURE
FOR RICHARD</b></p>
<p>The goal of
this campaign is two-fold: 1) In the next two weeks we are seeking to preserve
the roof over Richard’s head by setting up a living trust from these campaign
funds;  2) In the process, we will introduce Richard’s artwork to the
public so that it can help provide him with a sustainable revenue stream moving
forward. </p><p> After we save his home, we are planning a formalized showing in Los
Angeles of Richard's paintings - a vast body of work
created between 1964 and 1978. The ultimate hope is that we help establish an appreciation &amp;
interest in the art, so that Richard never has to fear domestic foreclosure
again. Of course, Thorbird himself is worth such an endeavor, but moreover, we
believe his artwork -- heretofore unknown to the general public -- will be
highly praised and valued as it is revealed. <br/></p><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b></b></span></p><p>You can view more of Richard's work here: <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/25533577@N04/sets/72157650303669822/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/25533577@N04/sets/72157651815487738/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Richard Thorbird</a>.  </p>

Less than a

paintings dating back to the mid-60′s thru the
late 70′s.  His exquisite art seems as
if pulled from a time-capsule, yet the imagery somehow remains contemporary.
 This revelation makes the re-introduction of Richard Thorbird to the art
world and the 21st century thrilling for us and the inevitable next step in helping to save his home.  We
could not be more proud or excited to present these hidden gems to the public for the first time.
Born in
1937, Richard Thorstenson (A.K.A. Thor, Thorbird, Ricardo Montalblonde or just
Montalblonde) is originally from Duluth, Minnesota. With a degree in Art from
the University of Minnesota, Richard packed up his 1940 Chevy hot-rod and
headed west to Topanga Canyon at the beginning of the counter-cultural
revolution. Over the following decade and half, amidst the bohemian enclave of
artists gathering in Southern California, Thorbird made hundreds of paintings,
scraping together a living by selling them to friends, celebrities, and local
characters straight from his home. We believe they embody not only the unique
vision of a genuine talent, but the essence of California’s golden age, and its
spirit of creative, sexual, and psychedelic discovery.
THE DRIVE TO
SAVE THORBIRD'S HOME
Richard's
home in Topanga Canyon is in foreclosure due to a series of unfortunate events
(none of which Richard will allow himself to feel victimized by). Richard is 78
years old, has no family, and is isolated from the world because of his age and
poor health. Without family or funds, if he doesn’t come up with $17,500
by April 30th, he will become homeless and will quite literally lose
everything. The bank will repossess Richard’s small home and take away a
lifetime of earnest hard work and creativity.
We’re making
this effort and doing what we’re doing because Richard is one of us and, quite
simply, he is worth it.  We firmly believe that as a society, we
must continue to place value on special individuals like Richard who inspire us
creatively and  as human beings.  We are all in this effort
together, as a group of young artists, and are rallying to help him raise this
money.  Richard’s struggle is not unique, but he is -- we truly
appreciate the gold he shares and reflects back to us all.

Angeles of Richard's paintings - a vast body of work
created between 1964 and 1978. The ultimate hope is that we help establish an appreciation &
interest in the art, so that Richard never has to fear domestic foreclosure
again. Of course, Thorbird himself is worth such an endeavor, but moreover, we

<h3>Who Are You Guys?</h3>
<p>We are a team of high school students with a passion for charity, art, and engineering. As part of our community service cirriculum, we build and race sculptures in the <a href=""http://www.kineticgrandchampionship.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kinetic Grand Championship</a> and raise money for <a href=""http://bettychinn.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Betty Chinn's charity</a>.</p>

<li>This will be our fourth year racing.</li>
<li>We have raised over $700 for Betty, and donated countless socks and cans of food.</li>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>This year, we are trying to ""do it right"". The first year we raced, our sculpture was nothing but two bikes welded together, braced with conduit and duct tape. The second year, we overcompensated and built a frame out of 2"" water pipe that was at a minimum three times overly heavy and strong for our two pilots. All we could find at the junk yard were three differently sized motorcycle tires.</p>
<p>The third year, we realized that there were reasons the other team's sculptures were built the way they were-</p>
<ul>
<li>They wanted speed and lightweight construction</li>
<li>They had money</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: xx-small;"">We wanted the first and didn't have the second. We solicited donations from local businesses and were fortunate to be given enough metal to build a light and fast sculpture. We fundraised and scrounged the junk yard for other parts, managing to build a much improved sculpture for less than $450.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: xx-small;"">This year, we are at it once again. Our welders have been busy refurbishing last year's frame and our art team has designed a Roman Chariot theme for our new art. We have been fundraising, but we have large goals. Our most experienced welders and engineers are graduating this year and they want to build a sculpture that will last after they leave. The most complicated and maintenance-intense part of the sculpture are the bike parts that we use to drive the machine, something that we have to upgrade if the sculpture is going to last past this year.</span></p>
<p>Any money we raise here will be spent on</p>

<div><b><br/></b></div>Hi. Hello. Welcome!  </b>We are Matilde, Daniel and Sara and together we are B'atz'. We believe in connecting communities through culture and creativity, and
hope you will be as inspired by our vision as we are. We're passionate about Guatemala's beautiful textile art and turn it into unique boots and bags that will have a positive impact not just on your wardrobe, but on all the hands that have come together to weave, embroider, stitch and love them to life.<br/><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<br/>
<p>B’atz’ means “thread” in the Mayan language
Kaqchikel. It is the thread of life that unites all living things, and in daily life it is the
thread that is used to weave the beautiful traditional textiles that are a
great source of pride here in Guatemala. These
threads tie each of us to our communities and cultures all over the world, but they
also connect us to each other through<span> bridges that allow us to share skills and inspiration. B’atz’ is about building these bridges so that talented
local artisans can share their gifts and you can invest in ethically and
beautifully handcrafted works of art to wear with pride. </span></p>
<p><span><b>***Please see the gallery (last tab, top of page) for more lovely photos***</b><br/></span></p>

<h4><br/></h4>
<h3>Why?<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>Women are at the heart of Guatemala's <span>vibrant textile culture,
and also of what we do here at B’atz’. We believe women have the potential to
be powerful agents of revolutionary change in their communities. With the
opportunity to earn a sustainable living and share their talents with a wider
audience, this potential can be unleashed. We are supporting this process by linking hands with talented
women weavers, and are inviting you to join our network by taking our hand and investing in our vision.<br/><br/></span><h3><span>How?</span></h3>
<h3><span>
</span></h3>
<span><p>We are bringing this vision to life by creating
partnerships based on mutual respect and cooperation, and harnessing the power
of these partnerships as paths to prosperity. We believe in strengthening
people’s own ability to catalyse change in their communities and are currently
in the process of teaming up with a microloan provider here in Guatemala. We
will soon be ready to begin re-investing a portion of our proceeds in microloans
that will fund women’s innovative small business ideas all over Guatemala.</p>

<br/>
<p></p>
<h3>What we need

</h3>
<p>We operate
under a grassroots artisanal philosophy, meaning that every stage of production is
completed entirely by hand, requiring great skill and creativity. All materials, down to
shoelaces, buttons and rubber sole protectors are purchased from local small
businesses. The fabrics we use are woven thread by thread by women in the
Solol<em>á</em> region of Guatemala, with some patterns taking over a month to complete. As we expand, we hope to be able to join hands with
more artisans in more communities, strengthening our network, amplifying our
impact and <span>bringing you
many more beautiful textiles to choose from in the future. </span></p>
<p>The funds we
raise on this campaign will go towards:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>Fulfillment</b> – making sure you get your perks and that they are of our signature high
quality.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>Expanding our texile network</b> – we will
be seeking out more women weavers who want to share their talents with the
world.</p>
<p><span>·<span> <b>
</b></span></span><b>Tools</b> – we need to invest in new workshop tools so we can keep making high-quality beautiful products for a long time to come.</p>
<p><span></span><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>Building our website</b> so
we can continue to invest, empower and inspire!</p>

this project is <b>£2,500</b>. This is the minimum we need to get up and running, and so we have picked the ""fixed funding"" model, meaning that <i>we must meet our goal in order to access any funds raised</i>. We
also have 2 stretch goals:<br/><br/><p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>£3,000</b> – it’s not
much more but this little bit extra will allow us to do many more things, such as developing lots of new styles to offer you in the next few months.<br/></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
<b>£</b></span></span><b>7,000</b> – Whoa!

Crafting boots by hand is a complex process, but our talented partner artisans are experts and every pair is custom-fitted - even when you're on the other side of the world!

</div><br/></div>","** Hello lovely people visiting us after the 23rd of December 2014! All the information below is still correct, except for shipping estimates and shipping costs. As of 2015, orders are subject to a £25 shipping fee and will likely take 10-12 weeks to reach you from the time we receive your measurements, but we will keep you posted**
Hi. Hello. Welcome!  We are Matilde, Daniel and Sara and together we are B'atz'. We believe in connecting communities through culture and creativity, and
hope you will be as inspired by our vision as we are. We're passionate about Guatemala's beautiful textile art and turn it into unique boots and bags that will have a positive impact not just on your wardrobe, but on all the hands that have come together to weave, embroider, stitch and love them to life.

B’atz’ means “thread” in the Mayan language
Kaqchikel. It is the thread of life that unites all living things, and in daily life it is the
thread that is used to weave the beautiful traditional textiles that are a
great source of pride here in Guatemala. These
threads tie each of us to our communities and cultures all over the world, but they
also connect us to each other through bridges that allow us to share skills and inspiration. B’atz’ is about building these bridges so that talented
local artisans can share their gifts and you can invest in ethically and
beautifully handcrafted works of art to wear with pride. 
***Please see the gallery (last tab, top of page) for more lovely photos***





Why?

Women are at the heart of Guatemala's vibrant textile culture,
and also of what we do here at B’atz’. We believe women have the potential to
be powerful agents of revolutionary change in their communities. With the
opportunity to earn a sustainable living and share their talents with a wider
audience, this potential can be unleashed. We are supporting this process by linking hands with talented
women weavers, and are inviting you to join our network by taking our hand and investing in our vision.How?


We are bringing this vision to life by creating
partnerships based on mutual respect and cooperation, and harnessing the power
of these partnerships as paths to prosperity. We believe in strengthening
people’s own ability to catalyse change in their communities and are currently
in the process of teaming up with a microloan provider here in Guatemala. We
will soon be ready to begin re-investing a portion of our proceeds in microloans
that will fund women’s innovative small business ideas all over Guatemala.





What we need


We operate
under a grassroots artisanal philosophy, meaning that every stage of production is
completed entirely by hand, requiring great skill and creativity. All materials, down to
shoelaces, buttons and rubber sole protectors are purchased from local small
businesses. The fabrics we use are woven thread by thread by women in the
Sololá region of Guatemala, with some patterns taking over a month to complete. As we expand, we hope to be able to join hands with
more artisans in more communities, strengthening our network, amplifying our
impact and bringing you
many more beautiful textiles to choose from in the future. 
The funds we
raise on this campaign will go towards:
· 
Fulfillment – making sure you get your perks and that they are of our signature high
quality.
· 
Expanding our texile network – we will
be seeking out more women weavers who want to share their talents with the
world.
· 
Tools – we need to invest in new workshop tools so we can keep making high-quality beautiful products for a long time to come.
· 
Building our website so
we can continue to invest, empower and inspire!


· 
Funding our
first microloans – exciting!



Our goal for
this project is £2,500. This is the minimum we need to get up and running, and so we have picked the ""fixed funding"" model, meaning that we must meet our goal in order to access any funds raised. We
also have 2 stretch goals:· 
£3,000 – it’s not
much more but this little bit extra will allow us to do many more things, such as developing lots of new styles to offer you in the next few months.
· 
£7,000 – Whoa!
Incredible! With this kind of investment we could really grow. We would be able
to rent a workshop space all of our own, and hire more talented artisans eager
to share their talents.





The Good Stuff
All of the prices quoted here on or Indiegogo page are our starter sale prices - so grab 'em while they're discounted! Here is a
breakdown of our lovely boots and bags and how to order them:
We are currently
working with 3 different textiles:




                Maria                              Catarina                             Luisa



 

And 3
different tones of leather:



                  Café                                 Árbol                                Tinte




There are 2 flexible
styles of boot - Doblado Boot and Ankle Bootie. Plus 1 flexible style of bagpack (it’s both a bag and a backpack!) - Mochila. ""Flexible” means that you
can design your very own by choosing which leather and fabric combinations
inspire you. 



     Doblado  Boot                   Ankle Bootie                     Doblado Boot

     (Café & Catarina)                      (Tinte & Catarina)                         (Árbol & Luisa) 




               Mochila - as shoulder bag           Mochila - as backpack
                                                                   (Café & Maria)
We also have a fixed style of handbag - Morralito - which comes in 2 different colour combos - Tierra and Colibri.  



The textiles in these beauties are totally unique and we have a very limited number of each - 10 of Tierra and 5 of Colibri.



             
Morralito (Tierra)                                                       Morralito (Colibri)



                    Lastly, we have some lovely Arcoiris bracelets on offer for those of you who aren't ready for boots or a bag just yet. We had a lot of fun making these bracelets and love them so much we wanted to keep them for ourselves! They come in many different colours and no two are alike.

       Contributing to the Barefoot Bowl Project will not only make me ecstatic. You will receive unique one of a kind perks. What is shown in the video is just the tip of the iceberg of possibilities of how this project can grow.
The Footprints
              The Barefoot Bowl project simply can not grow without your support. Supporting this project is also supporting me as an artist. With your help I may flourish in the art of pottery and continue on to become a happy and successful potter. I have the enthusiasm, creativity, and determination and am confidant in my ability to provide fantastic perks. The world needs Barefoot Bowls and you can help make it happen! You don't even need to contribute much.
Barebones Support!
             If you aren't in the financial position to contribute you can still help! Spread the word using the Indiegogo share tools or just tell people about my project. Any support is valuable to me and I greatly appreciate those who do.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In the past couple of years  they worked together on various projects. The most spectacular work they did (together with a bunch of other artists) was called 'WEDNESDAY' (<a href=""https://vimeo.com/29523773"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vimeo.com/29523773</a>) which won a price at the 32nd Wroclaw Stage Song Review Festival in 2011. 'WEDNESDAY' was based on an original idea by Grzegorz. It was a performance about 'an astronout' who goes into space forever. During the performance 'the astronaut' would give 'a goodbye-hug' to every member of the public before entering 'a rocket' and then leaving Earth forever. The performance was premiered in late 2010 at DeltA Center For Contemporary Art in The Hague and then performed again in March 2011 in Wroclaw.</p>
<p>The current project - the art video to one of OMEGA IMPACT songs - is based on the idea by Grzegorz. The video will consist of several short scenes of cutting different types of wood by a couple of female performers. The short scenes will be recorded each in different style with variety of costumes and scenography. Additionally to that, the sounds of cuting wood will be recorded and mixed with the audio of the song. The video will be shot in one of the squats in The Hague.</p>

<li>Open studio for all those out there who need the materials, space, advice or artistic camaraderie to create something extraordinary.</li>
<li>Support for emerging artists with services such as critique circles and collaborative production groups, making it a place of growth a professional development.</li>
<li>Art Gallery to highlight the work of unique and interesting artists.</li>
</ul><p>The Art Grist believes that providing each of these services together, under one roof, makes for a dynamic art community. Great art making has a huge impact on Art Education, and Art Education is an essential part of creating great Art. Artists of all ages and skill levels, informing and inspiring the next painting, the next piece of pottery, the next couture dress - that comes from a vibrant art community.</p>

<p>Kristin and Heather have saved and saved for this moment, and they are putting their entire savings into the project.

<p>It all started with two very simple TRUTHS: we love ART and we're crazy about T-SHIRTS. So we decided to create a community of artists that can express themselves using t-shirts as their canvas.<img alt=""Taparrabo Tees"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/824406/pictures/full/20130522040349-Taparrabo-Timeline-Tees.jpg?1369220635"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> In Puerto Rico you can find art everywhere…from amazing urban murals on the walls of one of the poorest parts of San Juan, to world-class museums, sculptures, tattoos and more…is like we say: “from artists, looneys and kings, everyone has their thing”, or something like that…<img alt=""Murales Santurce"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/824404/pictures/full/20130522040045-Santurce_es_Ley_Murales.jpg?1369220447"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> Here we like to show who we really are and we do so with creative expressions every day. That’s why Taparrabo will help unite many local and international artists in one community where they can showcase their work, sell their designs on t-shirts and get people to know them for their ART.</p>
<p>And so we ensure ART continues to be developed in Puerto Rico, we will share part of our profits with the Crearte Foundation. This way we can grow that community from within and spread this crazy mission we have of <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Dusting Out Daily Worries One Masterpiece at a Time</span></strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>what does Taparrabo mean</strong></h3>
<p>Taparrabo is the Spanish word for <strong><em>loincloth</em></strong>. The loincloth is a basic form of dress, often worn as an only garment, especially in societies where no other clothing is needed or wanted.</p>
<p>Basically a Taparrabo is what our native Indians used to wear to hide their stuff! So why Taparrabo? Well it was the first and most basic piece of clothing from our ancestors and t-shirts are our #1 choice of wear today…</p>
<h3><strong>what we need </strong></h3>
<p>We want to make this happen and to do so we need three main things:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">1. The design and development of our complete website (aprox. cost of $12,000) that includes:</p>
<ol></ol><ul>
<li>Our artists’ community showing who they are, their portfolios, links to contact them, etc.</li>
<li>The online store that allows you to browse by artist, category, color…</li>
<li>A Create-Your-Own web designer tool, so people can make their customized designs online</li>
<li>Our blog, impact on our community and more</li>

<p> </p></div>","who we are
It all started with two very simple TRUTHS: we love ART and we're crazy about T-SHIRTS. So we decided to create a community of artists that can express themselves using t-shirts as their canvas.
 In Puerto Rico you can find art everywhere…from amazing urban murals on the walls of one of the poorest parts of San Juan, to world-class museums, sculptures, tattoos and more…is like we say: “from artists, looneys and kings, everyone has their thing”, or something like that…
 Here we like to show who we really are and we do so with creative expressions every day. That’s why Taparrabo will help unite many local and international artists in one community where they can showcase their work, sell their designs on t-shirts and get people to know them for their ART.
And so we ensure ART continues to be developed in Puerto Rico, we will share part of our profits with the Crearte Foundation. This way we can grow that community from within and spread this crazy mission we have of Dusting Out Daily Worries One Masterpiece at a Time.
what does Taparrabo mean
Taparrabo is the Spanish word for loincloth. The loincloth is a basic form of dress, often worn as an only garment, especially in societies where no other clothing is needed or wanted.
Basically a Taparrabo is what our native Indians used to wear to hide their stuff! So why Taparrabo? Well it was the first and most basic piece of clothing from our ancestors and t-shirts are our #1 choice of wear today…
what we need 
We want to make this happen and to do so we need three main things:
1. The design and development of our complete website (aprox. cost of $12,000) that includes:

Our artists’ community showing who they are, their portfolios, links to contact them, etc.
The online store that allows you to browse by artist, category, color…
A Create-Your-Own web designer tool, so people can make their customized designs online
Our blog, impact on our community and more

2. A digital direct-to-garment printer to print full color designs on our high-quality 100% ringspun cotton t-shirts; these printers prices average from $10,000 to $20,000.
 3. A new iron press to seal the ink on the t-shirts that goes for $750.
 
And there are many more expenses that we need to cover to make this happen...but with our life savings, bank loans and other sources of income we’ll have to manage…
what you get
We know you just like to help out projects you believe in and want to see succeed; this is why you do it!
And even though you’ll get our most sincere and heartfelt appreciation for helping us out with our dream… we’ve come up with additional art-related perks to make your contribution even more worthwhile.

<h3>Painting the South</h3>
<p>I am Claudia Massie, an artist from Scotland. This summer, I will be travelling around Southern France and Northern Spain in search of new landscapes to paint. I will record the landscapes I encounter in sketches and plein air paintings and then produce a series of larger works in the studio when I return home.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I did a similar expedition across Northern Europe, driving from Holland to Norway via Germany, Denmark and Sweden. The trip was genuinely inspirational and the experience of documenting the fresh landscapes and intense light and colours of the Northern summer had a significant impact upon my approach to painting.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489052333/ffczdsxgqhmucdf81kvv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Wooden cabins in the forest at Åybtorp, Sweden</i></p>
<p>I had a baby last year and this summer's expedition will represent my return to painting. I am eager to get to work again after a break of a few months and have no doubt that the new landscapes I encounter will be stimulating and fruitful. My family will accompany me on this trip and while I paint they will enjoy their own adventures. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489052401/wg5gveccwbboi7rh7xo1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Painting in the shade, Skåne, Sweden</i></p>
<h3>Why get involved?</h3>
<p>It is important to me to seek fresh inspiration in new landscapes and my experience of overseas previous expeditions has been hugely positive. As such, I will do this trip in some form regardless of any external funding but being able to share the work I produce will both help extend the adventure and make it more challenging (there's a certain pressure involved when you know your sketches must be shared) and a lot of fun (it's exciting to work like this). I hope that any potential backers will be thrilled by the prospect of receiving an original piece of art through the mail by the end of the summer, or a larger oil painting by Christmas.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Perks: what you will receive</strong></p>
<p>I am offering a range of ""perks"" from postcards and plein air acrylic studies to large, framed oil paintings. This is your chance to commission a unique, original artwork, some of which will be mailed direct from locations along my journey.</p>
<p>If you choose to get involved with this venture, I will select your commissioned picture from the strongest work produced during the trip. What you receive will be my choice - this is part of the enjoyment! However, I am happy to accommodate specific requests too. It is essential that everyone who contributes is happy with what they receive.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I can't wait to get painting again and the opportunity to re-engage with the process of looking and drawing and painting in a new environment is, as ever, tremendously exciting. During my previous expedition, I produced around 70 new pieces of art ranging from postcard sized sketches to large oil paintings. I would hope to be equally productive this time and return home with a substantial body of new work, the best of which will be dispatched to backers.</p>

I had a baby last year and this summer's expedition will represent my return to painting. I am eager to get to work again after a break of a few months and have no doubt that the new landscapes I encounter will be stimulating and fruitful. My family will accompany me on this trip and while I paint they will enjoy their own adventures.

Why get involved?
It is important to me to seek fresh inspiration in new landscapes and my experience of overseas previous expeditions has been hugely positive. As such, I will do this trip in some form regardless of any external funding but being able to share the work I produce will both help extend the adventure and make it more challenging (there's a certain pressure involved when you know your sketches must be shared) and a lot of fun (it's exciting to work like this). I hope that any potential backers will be thrilled by the prospect of receiving an original piece of art through the mail by the end of the summer, or a larger oil painting by Christmas.

Perks: what you will receive
I am offering a range of ""perks"" from postcards and plein air acrylic studies to large, framed oil paintings. This is your chance to commission a unique, original artwork, some of which will be mailed direct from locations along my journey.
If you choose to get involved with this venture, I will select your commissioned picture from the strongest work produced during the trip. What you receive will be my choice - this is part of the enjoyment! However, I am happy to accommodate specific requests too. It is essential that everyone who contributes is happy with what they receive.

The Impact
I can't wait to get painting again and the opportunity to re-engage with the process of looking and drawing and painting in a new environment is, as ever, tremendously exciting. During my previous expedition, I produced around 70 new pieces of art ranging from postcard sized sketches to large oil paintings. I would hope to be equally productive this time and return home with a substantial body of new work, the best of which will be dispatched to backers.

<h3>About Young but Capable</h3>
<p>Young but Capable Project is an art and writing anthology featuring seventeen artists and seven writers. On the administrative team we have two artists, a writer, and a beta reader. The project is organized by American Kestrel, who is running this campaign. The team has been working on this project since September 2019 and, in addition to the book, would like to offer additional stickers, prints, and charms to this project.</p>
<p><i>So what makes Young but Capable different and worth supporting? </i></p>
<p>Our core mission is lifting up young, often overlooked, creative talent. It’s about saying that years of experience aren’t everything. It’s about acknowledging the amount of respect that the dedication and enthusiasm of young adults deserves. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Crowdfunding this project should provide us with enough to meet our three primary objectives: paying our contributing creatives, offset production costs, and donate a little bit to charities around the world. Our goal has been set at $3,000 which will help cover the following expenses:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581138070/oqmmeouo4kbc6beuymde.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Paying our contributors.</strong> There are 26 people behind the creation of this project. Around 34% of funding costs go to them, if we meet our goal. If we surpass our goal, 50% of the excess funds also go to them.</p>
<p><strong>Fulfillment of perks: </strong>From sampling to printing and ordering merchandise, more than half of the initial expenses fit into this category. This also includes Indiegogo fees and transaction fees. </p>
<p><strong>Charity funds:</strong> 5%, or around $150, of our initial funding goal goes to support three amazing causes. These causes are the Polaris Project, Cystic Fibrosis Canada, and a Fire Relief Fund for First Nations in Australia. If we surpass our goal, 50% of excess funds will go to these causes.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So what happens if this anthology is a success? You get some really wonderful creative work and support some important global causes! This project will also help boost visibility for these creative people and let other young artists and writers be inspired.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we succeed in our funding goal before the midpoint of the campaign, stretch goals will be made available. Those will feature in an update.</p>
<p>As stated above, this an all-or-nothing or fixed funding campaign; if we don’t raise the full amount or more, you get refunded and none of the physical perks will be printed or made. We will update backers on our plans, if that ends up being the case.</p>
<p>We have a wide pool of contributors due to our focus on giving fresh voices a place to be heard. It's a risk that not all of them might deliver the content expected. You'll still get some excellent pieces.</p>
<p>In any project like this, the printer is an important factor. We plan to use established vendors with a reputation for delivering, and will make sure to look into outcomes before placing the order. American Kestrel has experience in this domain, and is excited to look at their outcomes.</p>
<p>We have also received samples from several sticker and acrylic charm producing vendors. This gives us the opportunity to do quality assurance on their end product, meaning the risk is not whether they can deliver, but whether they can do so in a timely manner. Much like the printers, part of this will be out of our hands once the order is put in, but we've done the best job we can do as far as selecting them.</p>
<p>For an international project, the question of international shipping comes up. While we've priced things to reflect the shipping prices as they are now, there's always a chance those prices might change. We've built in a margin we believe is large enough to cover things even in the event of an unexpected increase.</p>

I'm an artist, designer, and musician based in Atlanta, GA. My love of art and music collided in 2002 when I started designing gigposters.</p><p><br/>Over the past 18 years, I've had the honor of creating over 350 gigposters for the bands Superdrag, Dinosaur Jr., Nada Surf, Letters To Cleo, Ozma, The Rentals, El Scorcho, Daniel Miller, Hyperspace, The Descendents, Guided By Voices, and many more.</p><p><br/>Being in quarantine inspired me to self-publish a 132 page book that collects all of my poster designs to date. I thought this would be a fun way to celebrate a time when we could go see super awesome shows and without having to worry about a global pandemic.</p><p><br/>With this campaign, I'm asking for your support to help offset the cost of printing the books and have plenty of cool incentives in return for your donations. Some of the designs in this book will be printed and published in color for the first time.

I'm an artist, designer, and musician based in Atlanta, GA. My love of art and music collided in 2002 when I started designing gigposters.Over the past 18 years, I've had the honor of creating over 350 gigposters for the bands Superdrag, Dinosaur Jr., Nada Surf, Letters To Cleo, Ozma, The Rentals, El Scorcho, Daniel Miller, Hyperspace, The Descendents, Guided By Voices, and many more.Being in quarantine inspired me to self-publish a 132 page book that collects all of my poster designs to date. I thought this would be a fun way to celebrate a time when we could go see super awesome shows and without having to worry about a global pandemic.With this campaign, I'm asking for your support to help offset the cost of printing the books and have plenty of cool incentives in return for your donations. Some of the designs in this book will be printed and published in color for the first time. John Davis, the lead singer of Superdrag and The Lees of Memory has even provided the intro to the book reflecting on how gigposters help fans commemorate the time they had at the show.Rocking Rewards Include the Following:· Exclusive Rock Soldier stickers and buttons.· A downloadable e-book version of the book.· Having your name printed and featured in the book.· Rock Soldier t-shirts and hats· Printed versions of the book are available in softcover and hardcover.· Several rare, one-of-a-kind artist proofs of sold out Superdrag posters. Once the campaign is complete, all rewards will ship by December 2020. Shipping times may vary due to COVID-19.Can’t contribute, don't worry! You can still help me by sharing this page and getting the word out.

<p><strong>THE EXHIBITION</strong></p>
<p>Place, travel and environment play an important part in the fiber artist Maria-Theresa Fernandes’ internationally acclaimed work. Throughout her career, travel has given her the opportunity to reflect and create works relating to the surroundings of the countries she experienced. History and poetry are brilliantly woven into the fabric of Fernandes’ works, which translate her physical and emotional attachment to the lands she visited. </p>

<p><strong>ARTIST STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>Travel has been the main source of inspiration and has influenced the direction of my work over the years. Some countries, it's people and the landscape have contributed to the imagery, concepts in my work. The investigation of new materials and technology has allowed for experimentation. While earlier works showed the use of paint and stitchery as mark making, recent work has involved the density of population in East London and it's rich cultural diversity. Place and living in the surroundings is an important element in my work. The physical and emotional aspect of feeling and experiencing rather than an artificial portrayal of the environment. Density of surface using layering of material to create a dimensional effect related to the density of population. Some work was also politically related e.g. The Wait 2009, ""Exclusion"" 2006. These works were created as a result of living in E.London where over 200 languages are spoken. Technical skills often using traditional application is combined with new technology. I often take workshops in order to improve my skills and this allows for another way of thinking and working. The business and commercial area of London has recently inspired the new body of work. Handmade felting using translucent material is combined with digital photography and printing to create works that relate to the new development of this area which has recently been bought by the Chinese for business purposes. The relocation back to Baltimore after 12 years is exciting. Baltimore has a large Art Community and the abandoned buildings have some amazing art. I would like to work on a project showing the contrasts of 2 cities one that has a smaller diverse community, the other, a Major World City that is large and has the most diverse Group of people living there.</p>

<p><strong><em> Live It, Breathe It</em></strong> comes as the idea-child of Titilayo Derricotte, graduate of Newark, NJ's performing Arts High School and is a recent graduate of New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. The goal of this evening-length performance is to showcase artistic talent ranging from dance, drama, and vocal to instrumental and visual arts. In addition, <strong><em>Live It, Breathe It</em></strong> seeks to provide an atmosphere for Newark’s talent and beyond to perform their crafts, and to immerse themselves in that which creatively gives them life and breath. <strong><em>Live It, Breathe It</em></strong> is a vehicle with many goals. We aim to instill a sense of value and purpose in the Newark arts community, create a movement among young professionals that will sustain and garner positive attention in the media, bridge gaps between artists, establish a sense of kinship, and engage the next wave of artists to aspire and achieve their dreams. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>The Impact </u></strong></p>
<p>In addition to being held at historical Newark Symphony Hall, a performance venue that has housed such great performers as James Brown, the Rolling Stones, Judy Garland, Sarah Vaughn and more, <strong><em>Live It, Breathe It</em></strong> aims to give voice to a new generation of artists. Further, it endeavors to present artists who are dedicated to their art form and wish to bring the fruits of their labor to a platform where the quietly thriving creative community of Newark, NJ can be seen in a positive light.  Ultimately <strong><em>Live It, Breathe It</em></strong> seeks to bring hope and higher aspirations to succeeding artistic generations.  What better way to accomplish this goal than provide the example ourselves?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>What We Need, What You Get</u></strong></p>
<p>The <strong><em>Live It, Breathe It</em></strong> campaign will begin on June 26, 2011 and end on October 10, 2011.  The performance is se to launch October 29, 2011 but we need funding now.  We want to make this event one that will go beyond a good night at the theatre to penetrate the consciousness of audience members.  We don't just want patrons to leave having seen an evening of excellent performances.  We want them to leave with a sense that this is something that can truly change the way Newark is viewed by the public, and that will inspire younger generations to become involved with the arts.  All monies will go to the <strong><em>Live It, Breathe It</em></strong> campaign which includes the Black Box theatre at Newark Symphony Hall, reception activities, and personal 'thank you, patron' gift bags to show our appreciation for supporting this incredible endeavor!</p>

<h3>Hey. Who the hell are you?</h3>
<p>Oh... hey there... um... I'm Griffin. I draw for a living. Just go to my website and see. It's ShadedAreas.com.</p>
<h3>Oh neat! So... what's all this then? A Nerdy Sexy Pinup Calendar?</h3>
<p>My tastefully sexy pinups of fictional icons have brought me a touch of positive notiriaty. I get lot of requests and a calendar is one of them. I think it's time to make it happen!<br/><br/>It's a great way to package up a collection of art that can be easily shared and shown. I'd be happy. You'd be happy. Future nerdy folks besides us would be happy. Everyone would win!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Neat! So... why haven't you done it yourself?</h3>
<p>Two reasons. Other paid commissions always get to cut in line and the cost of printing quality calendars is a little tough.</p>
<h3>So what's this ""Limited Edition"" stuff? Sounds like you're making a bunch of these.</h3>
<p>Oh! The campaign backers get an exclusive version of it. They will include ALL the pinups plus added materials. Then the calendars for public sale will include only the pinups.</p>
<p>Exclusive content is important with these things, IMHO.</p>
<h3>Sounds like you put a lot of thought into this. Why a campaign though?</h3>
</div>

<p>Thank you so much! I won't dissapoint.</p></div>","Hey. Who the hell are you?
Oh... hey there... um... I'm Griffin. I draw for a living. Just go to my website and see. It's ShadedAreas.com.
Oh neat! So... what's all this then? A Nerdy Sexy Pinup Calendar?
My tastefully sexy pinups of fictional icons have brought me a touch of positive notiriaty. I get lot of requests and a calendar is one of them. I think it's time to make it happen!It's a great way to package up a collection of art that can be easily shared and shown. I'd be happy. You'd be happy. Future nerdy folks besides us would be happy. Everyone would win!


Neat! So... why haven't you done it yourself?
Two reasons. Other paid commissions always get to cut in line and the cost of printing quality calendars is a little tough.
So what's this ""Limited Edition"" stuff? Sounds like you're making a bunch of these.
Oh! The campaign backers get an exclusive version of it. They will include ALL the pinups plus added materials. Then the calendars for public sale will include only the pinups.
Exclusive content is important with these things, IMHO.
Sounds like you put a lot of thought into this. Why a campaign though?


I think people would be excited about, but you can never be certain. This way I know people want it before I break my wrist trying to get it done. Also, this makes certain that other paid work can't cut in line. This won't be a personal project if it's backed.I'm kind of psyched about this if you can't tell. :-)

<h3>A huge door has opened for me that can help me become an international artist! ... and possibly get a Gary Smith Portait in Pastel too!<br/>
</h3>
<p>I am an artist who drawings and paints figures, portraits, urban scenes and murals. <br/></p>
<p>I have been invited to compete at the Louvre (under the Crystal) in Figure Drawing. This event also includes displaying large artwork there. <br/></p>
<p><b>The Impact:</b></p>
<p>This can lead to my being able to sell my paintings in other countries which is a HUGE jump in any artist's career. </p>
<p>ALREADY a Fine Art Auction House <b>in China</b> has let me know they are interested in representing me if I do well.  ... so it i up to me now that this door is open.<br/></p>
<p><b>What I need:</b></p>
<p>I have managed to save the money for the French Art Symposium ($2600) and the flight but am short for such costs as boxing and shipping large artwork BY ONLY $1800.</p>
<p><b>What you get:</b></p>
<p>If you can champion me for some amount and send me your email, I will send you photos and possibly a video of the event when I return. <br/></p>
<p>Furthermore if you sponsor me for $300 and send a photo of your family member or pet I will gladly draw him/her in soft pastels and mail it to you. This is a deeply discounted price.<br/></p>
<p>I am totally willing to earn your support.</p>

<p>Camp Cannonball is an interactive pirate ship structure built at the YMCA on Maui originally designed for Source! Maui Festival. The ship includes a bow that protrudes from the ground out towards the water. At Source! it serves as a hang out, stage and dance floor.

Stunning views of the Keanae coastline can be seen including friends and whales. This year we are adding a flame cannon to the crows nest, and to repair and reinforce existing structures.

</p><p><i>MANIFESTO</i></p>
<p>Everything around us seems to run quickly. We are not regardless to that. We let us carry away by the speed that surrounds us. We try to travel as much as possible, to collect music as much as possible, to see as many movies as possible, to visit as many exhibitions as possible, to read as many books as possible. Everything as quick as we can. Nowadays time is gold. The new economy is based on the exploitation of this speed. There is no time to waste for knowing people, programs like facebook, twitter or instagram allow you to live the world while seated on a chair. We can do our shopping with a click, make music with a click, have sex with a click. The newspapers compete for the latest news. The news is more and more concise and nimble. The advertising adapts to time. The product is not didactly represented anymore, only suggested. It is unveiled with a veil. As regards this vortex of time, that gets us down, the concept of this project is to reverse the course. People don't read much: I make lots of pages. Paper is dead, internet is everything: I make a paper publication. And most of all, instead of competing for the first place, I compete for the last by making a publication that comes out every 5 years. </p>
<p>The right period of time to verify the changes of taste, of language, of style and of the collective imaginary.</p>
<p>The publication is issued 5 yearly, but its contents has been prepared four years before that. It’s a time capsule. A bit like when as a kid you put a letter, a picture or a newspaper in a box, and then after years you look at it again with new eyes and another perspective. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Lisa Ann Sparks.  I am a fused glass artist based in Los Angeles.  I work out of my studio apartment and everything is handmade by me.  My work is mostly inspired by nature.  I am in love with the earth and what it has to show us.  I love working with glass because of it's natural beauty, and, as a bonus, I can always recycle it.  Glass itself is made from naturally occurring elements from the earth and I feel it does a beautiful job showcasing my designs inspired by nature.  </p>
<p>I have been working with glass for 10 years and selling my work fulltime for the last 5 years.  I sell both wholesale and retail.  The stores I sell to are boutiques, galleries and museums, and zoos and aquariums.  For retail, you can find me around LA at various farmer's markets, art festivals and street fairs.  </p>
<p>Which brings me to why I'm here asking for help.  The last year of trade shows has been very slow and this year has been the same.  It has been tough and I have been picking up odd jobs just to make ends meet.  I think it is time to try a different trade show and see if that brings in new business.  Autumn Fair is a trade show in Birmingham, England that focuses on the gift trade.  Not only is this a new set of potential buyers, it's also an amazing opportunity to share my handmade, nature-inspired, eco-conscious fused glass art with a global market.  How fabulous is that!  It is a great time to take this risk as the English Pound is very strong and the trend to import US made products into Europe is at it's height.  I asked the show for a small space and was lucky to get one.  Usually the layout is a 10' x 10' or nothing and that size booth is way out of my price range.  </p>
<p>I feel like this is a last ditch effort to try before throwing in the towel.  I do everything myself and I usually work around 12 hours a day.  Including markets, firings, creating new designs, updating my website, calling stores, accounting, etc. Having your own business is hard work and I am glad to do it if I can make it work.</p>
<p>I just need help with this next step.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is what I need and why I asking for $7,200.  Remember when I said the Pound was strong...it's great for them, but for us, more expensive.  The exchange rate is currently 1.52.</p>

Now I am going to use these handmade bricks to build  2 intersecting adobe walls that will be sealed, primed and prepped for painting. Throughout the course of a year local graffiti artists, painters and sculptors will be invited to design, paint, and build onto the surface of Con/Safos.

<i><div style=""text-align: right;""><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Photo by Marcel Hurtut at Self-Help Graphics<br/></i></div></i><br/>The Los Angeles River has long been a contested site in many forms. As of  2008, the Los Angeles Graffiti Abatement Program resulted in the removal of much of the historic graffiti that lined the embankments and walls along the river. It erased not only a significant history of artistic production specific to Los Angeles, but with it dislocated and disbanded a community whose primary creative forum was found along these banks. This collaboration is designed to highlight a history of displacement along the river, support local artists who historically lack organizational/ institutional and financial support, create a safe platform for artists to practice, build creative networks, and to help them explore exhibition opportunities inside and outside of traditional art spaces.<br/><br/>

</h3> <p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif;"">Con/Safos will help foster networks of support for artists who seek to or are actively making public art by providing a unique multimedia platform that is both public and accessible as well as financial support. SHGA has been a  generative space in this way for nearly 40 years and has provided countless services and opportunities to emerging artists whom are now some of the cities most prolific cultural producers. In thinking about access and my relationship to land, I have progressively made more work engaging audiences outside of traditional art spaces and in this effort to have a targeted conversation with “place”  and communities who often don’t access art in museums and galleries. With your help Con/Safos will connect artists with new avenues to explore their possibilities as makers inside and outside of mainstream art markets.<br/></p>

</div><div> <p> </p>
<p><span>The Bowtie Project is public land, a shared space, and this presents a few concrete challenges. Here’s an example: after the first day of making bricks with my father at the bowtie last summer, I came to discover a batch of bricks run over by a dirt bike. The bricks were unsalvageable. We had spent one full day working in the blazing sun to make them, and the thought of explaining to my father what had happened was more disappointing to me than the fact that they had been destroyed. But as I scraped up the crumbled, heavy chunks of damp clay from those 68 destroyed bricks, a realization came to me that would color my relationship with this piece of land into the weeks ahead. The realization that this land is a shared space and utilized by many in different ways directly inspired the Con/Safos project. </span></p>

C/S or Con/Safos (with respect) is a year long project along the banks of the Los Angeles River, created as part of the Bowtie Project on California State Parks land. Over the summer of 2014 my father and I, with help from the rest of my family and some friends, made 1500 adobe bricks which were used as part of site-specific performance. Now I am going to use these handmade bricks to build  2 intersecting adobe walls that will be sealed, primed and prepped for painting. Throughout the course of a year local graffiti artists, painters and sculptors will be invited to design, paint, and build onto the surface of Con/Safos. This work will provide an open sanctioned space for painters and graffiti artists to create temporal artworks. 


C/S Mock-Up with works by Timo Fahler and Iris HuI am partnering up with three organizations: Clockshop, an arts organization, California State Parks, and Self Help Graphics & Art, a popular and vital community resource for the creation and presentation of Chicano/Mexicano art and culture in East LA to create this work. Self Help will invite each participating artists to partake in their Atelier Program where they will print a limited edition serigraphic print inspired by their work at C/S. SHGA will also be conducting onsite experiments creating dyes from native plants to use in printing, thus producing their first ever site-specific edition and infusing each print with the feeling and life of the LA river. 



Photo by Marcel Hurtut at Self-Help GraphicsThe Los Angeles River has long been a contested site in many forms. As of  2008, the Los Angeles Graffiti Abatement Program resulted in the removal of much of the historic graffiti that lined the embankments and walls along the river. It erased not only a significant history of artistic production specific to Los Angeles, but with it dislocated and disbanded a community whose primary creative forum was found along these banks. This collaboration is designed to highlight a history of displacement along the river, support local artists who historically lack organizational/ institutional and financial support, create a safe platform for artists to practice, build creative networks, and to help them explore exhibition opportunities inside and outside of traditional art spaces.

Con/Safos will be free and open to the public to view, up to and while the works are being created.List of Participating Artists (names added as confirmed):Sarah DoughertyTimo Fahler Juan Manuel GudiñoHOODsistersIris Hu Leo LimonThe Maricon CollectiveLocal Bowtie Artists


Onsite Graffiti at the Bowtie Project

Rafa Esparza is a multidisciplinary artist. His work ranges in medium from installation, sculpture to drawing, painting; and most predominantly live performance. Woven into Esparza’s bodies of work are his interests in history, personal narratives, and kinship. He is inspired by his own relationship to colonization and the disrupted genealogies that come forth as a result of this. Esparza has performed in a variety of spaces ranging from community engaged places such as AIDS Project Los Angeles, to galleries including Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, Highways Performance Space, REDCAT, Human Resources, SOMArts and most recently public sites through out the city of L.A. He is a recipient of an Emerging Artist 2014 California Community Foundation Fellowship for Visual Artists. 


Rafa Esparza Performance Summer 2014
For almost 40 years, Self Help Graphics & Art has emerged as the leading visual arts cultural center which serves the predominantly Chicano/Mexicano community of Los Angeles. Located in the heart of East Los Angeles, and surrounded by a local population of over two million Chicanos/Mexicanos, Self Help Graphics & Art has been a popular and vital community resource of for the creation and presentation of Chicano/Mexicano art and culture in East LA. SHGA is a nationally recognized center for Latino arts that develops and nurtures artists in printmaking. It seeks to advance Latino art broadly through programming, exhibitions and outreach to diverse audiences in East Los Angeles and beyond. SHGA seeks to identify and engage young and emerging artists from the community in all aspects of its activities.

California State Parks contains the largest and most diverse natural and cultural heritage holdings of any state agency in the nation. State park units include underwater preserves, reserves, and parks; redwood, rhododendron, and wildlife reserves; state beaches, recreation areas, wilderness areas, and reservoirs; state historic parks, historic homes, Spanish era adobe buildings, including museums, visitor centers, cultural reserves, and preserves; as well as lighthouses, ghost towns,  waterslides, conference centers, and off-highway vehicle parks. These parks protect and preserve an unparalleled collection of culturally and environmentally sensitive structures and habitats, threatened plant and animal species, ancient Native American sites, historic structures and artifacts . . . the best of California's natural and cultural history.


The Bowtie ProjectThe Bowtie Project is a collaboration between Clockshop and California State Parks to activate a 19-acre post-industrial lot known as The Bowtie, located along the LA River in Northeast Los Angeles. Owned by CA State parks since 2003 and closed to the public for over a decade, Clockshop has been invited to bring a broad and experimental blend of artists’ projects and collaborations to this overlooked piece of land.
This partnership is made possible with support from California State Parks Foundation, the Metropolitan Water District, the National Park Service, and the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority.

   The Impact
 Con/Safos will help foster networks of support for artists who seek to or are actively making public art by providing a unique multimedia platform that is both public and accessible as well as financial support. SHGA has been a  generative space in this way for nearly 40 years and has provided countless services and opportunities to emerging artists whom are now some of the cities most prolific cultural producers. In thinking about access and my relationship to land, I have progressively made more work engaging audiences outside of traditional art spaces and in this effort to have a targeted conversation with “place”  and communities who often don’t access art in museums and galleries. With your help Con/Safos will connect artists with new avenues to explore their possibilities as makers inside and outside of mainstream art markets.

Risks & Challenges
  
The Bowtie Project is public land, a shared space, and this presents a few concrete challenges. Here’s an example: after the first day of making bricks with my father at the bowtie last summer, I came to discover a batch of bricks run over by a dirt bike. The bricks were unsalvageable. We had spent one full day working in the blazing sun to make them, and the thought of explaining to my father what had happened was more disappointing to me than the fact that they had been destroyed. But as I scraped up the crumbled, heavy chunks of damp clay from those 68 destroyed bricks, a realization came to me that would color my relationship with this piece of land into the weeks ahead. The realization that this land is a shared space and utilized by many in different ways directly inspired the Con/Safos project. 


At the Bowtie ProjectFrom the people that live there, to the students that cut through the park to get to and from school, to the neighbors who walk their pets in the morning and sunset, to the kayakers rowing downstream in packs, to the veteranos who proudly wear their neighborhood on their bodies, to the taggers who claim it as their own by writing on it. I put up signs in English in Spanish explaining what my family and I were doing at the park, moved our workstation out of the open space and throughout the rest of the 3-4 weeks the bricks were left unharmed. I got to meet many of the regulars that pass through the park, many of whom live there. I had conversations with them, had lunch with them, as we shared bits of each others lives with one another. The challenge and the opportunity I see in Con/Safos is to engage a community that has been criminalized. The sanctioning of the walls and making them accessible is part of the way I plan to engage graffiti artists; where the writing on the walls will itself can be the mode of communication and an invitation for collaboration.

<h3>PROJECT</h3>
<p>The continuation of the PDX Art Guide takes our ongoing publication and puts it in the hands of artists to showcase their own style for special quarterly releases.</p>
<p>Our Art Guide is a project that highlights art spaces in Portland, Oregon. The project's goal is to both feature art spaces important to the community and to help expand the visibility of selected artists. The publication also looks to unite art spaces, museums, galleries, and project spaces in a risograph publication designed in each artists' interpretation which will be issued quarterly.</p>
<p>We're hoping to reach our fundraising goal so that we can offer these guides free to the public. These quarterly publications will be available at select establishments all around the Portland area.</p>
<p>We're expanding our scope beyond just documenting the contemporary art scene and sharing it on our <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/artandaboutpdx"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Instagram</strong></a>, our main social media platform. This project aims to accomplish this movement outside digital media to something physical and tangible for the community.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>SUPPORT</h3>
<p>Your contribution will greatly assist in reaching the goals of our project. Contributions will go towards the costs of; paper; ink, printing, artist stipends, and creative content. We're hoping to print at least 100 copies of each artists' collaborative guide.</p>
<p>This project is for the Portland arts community, and we hope that we have your support with this project. So we can continue to produce and expand on projects that uplift the arts community.</p>
<p>Additional funds we receive beyond our goal will be instrumental to the realization of each artists' collaborations and materials. Even if you can't make a donation, we hope that you please spread the word about this project. We appreciate any contribution however big or small, it means so much to us!</p>

They established themselves in Clerkenwell Workshops, in London, and after a couple of years moved onto Clerkenwell Road, where the bindery has been ever since. While Rosie and Hannah left soon after, Mark kept the bindery going, surrounding himself with a team of highly skilled bookbinders from various backgrounds and training.</p><p>Now after all of these years, Mark is retiring. Julian, Kaori and Pauline, all employees for more than 10 years, together with the same team (Aimee, Amélie, Kate, Nick and Piotr) have decided to take on the challenge of keeping the Wyvern going and building on it's legacy.</p><p>The bindery is dedicated to preserving the highest standards of craftsmanship and we pride ourselves in our work and problem solving. Using traditional skills, we aim to produce quality work tailored to our client's specific requirements for design, budget and deadline.
