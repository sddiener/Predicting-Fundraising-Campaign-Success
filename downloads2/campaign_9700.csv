<p class=""Formatlibre"">La recherche poétique s’articule autour du mythe de la «Femme-Arbre», créature imaginaire, mythique et symbolique, Fées-Esprit de la Forêt, qu’évoquent les Hespérides.

<p class=""Formatlibre""><strong><em>Inspiration and description of the project </em></strong></p>
<p class=""Formatlibre""><em>In the ancient Greek mythology, Hesperides are the three nymphs of the Sunset. They live in a fabulous orchard, the Garden of Hesperides, located in the western limit of the world. Hera had given them the task of guarding and protecting the golden apples of the Garden of Hesperides, and offered them for this task the assistance of the dragon Ladon.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>The poetical research is articulated around the myth of the ""Tree-Woman"", the mythical and symbolic creature, Fairies-spirit of the Forest, whom evoke Hesperides. The performance will be sensitive, elaborated with feminity and grace, filled with strong and symbolic images, but also with a part of humor. The characters will sometimes be metamorphosed in trees, sometimes emerging  from the landscape under more human features, sometimes acting like pure ethereal spirits.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>The protagonists of this unique moment will be Caroline Rochefort, a dancer, aerialist and equestrian voltigeuse; Hélène Leveau, looserope walker and equilibrist; Marie-Claude Bouillon, equestrian trainer and rider, accompanied with three circus horses. The music will be created live by Maïeul Clairefond, with his electric bass and various sound objects suspended from trees.</em></p>
<p class=""Formatlibre""><em> </em></p>
<p class=""Formatlibre""><em>The project will take place in a forest that touches the heart of the village of Notre-Dame-du-Rosaire, in the Park of Appalachians.

The site will be accessible by foot by an enlighten path from the village. Three representations will be offered on August 29, 30 and 31th.</em></p>

<p><strong>What is Ligature?</strong></p>
<p>Ligature is an annual design symposium made up of three parts. </p>
<p>A gallery exhibition of juried student work.</p>
<p>A lecture series by internationally recognized designers. This year we are hosting:</p>       Laura Bee working in New York City, New York lovelyascanbee.com<p>       Josh Lafayette working in Atlanta, GA joshlafayette.com</p>
<p>   3.Hands-on workshops and portfolio reviews by the guest designers.</p>
<p>The best part about Ligature is that it is completely student-run, from the concept to the gallery design. Partially funded by Student Government, this event has become a gathering for alumni, designers from the community, and world-renowned artists who visit to share their insight in a rapidly changing industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Help us celebrate 26 Years!</strong></p>
<p>Ligature has been an integral part of UF's graphic design program as well as the Gainesville design community for the past 26 years–it’s an opportunity to meet and work alongside the designers that inspire us on a daily basis. With budget cuts increasing each year Ligature becomes more difficult to put together. Any money raised would help us complete the gallery, produce materials for the event, and supplement payment for the designers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Budget Breakdown for Ligature 26</strong></p>
<p>The funding we have received thus far has covered flights and part of the guests honorariums. However, we still need your help for the following: </p>
<p>Guest Honorariums: $1,000</p>
<p>Guest Expenses (hotel + gas + food): $1,000</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lets make this happen!</strong></p>
<p>If the available perks aren't appealing enough, let us know and we will personally try and figure something out for you!</p>
<p>If you have any questions at all, send email us at ligature26@gmail.com.</p> <p>Ligature 26 will be the weekend of February 25th, 2016 at University of Florida's Fine Arts Building C.</p>

An Excerpt From The Story


In a faraway kingdom that you’ve probably never heard ofA young princess was born on a cloudy spring day.She had three older sisters, all princesses,(because that’s what happens when your mom is the Queen, you know),But she was not like them.Her sisters were all born Princesses...But she was born a Ninja.The King and the Queen were quite distraught.“A ninja for a daughter!” they moaned. “The shame!”They filled her life with Princessly things,like ball gowns and ponies and tea parties and games,but it was no use.Her sisters ate teacakes andPrincess Ninja ate octopus.Her sisters drank honey tea andPrincess Ninja drank hot sauce.For dessert, her sisters had ice cream sundaes.And so did Princess Ninja...because even ninjas like ice cream.In their desperation, the King and Queen turned to Sir Zephyr, the Royal Retainer, wise in the ways of honour and nobility.“Help us, most honourable Sir,” they pleaded,“Princess Ninja is hardly a Princess at all!”As the months went by, the King and Queen grew impatient.“Well?” they asked one day. “Does she still think she’s a Ninja?”“Of course,” said Sir Zephyr. “She was born a Ninja.”“But she’s a Princess!” they insisted.“Of course,” said Sir Zephyr. “She was born a Princess.”

 Princess Ninja sets out on a quest to find someone who truly understands her: a pet. What sort of pet would a Princess Ninja choose? Why, nothing short of a dragon.On her journey, she discovers that sometimes even she can have misconceptions, and sometimes the most important thing you can find is a friend.  What We Need & What You Get I've gotten quotes from several online and local publishers, as well as sampled finding an illustrator on Elance. Of the roughly 24 submissions I received on Elance, I found 7 or 8 that were skilled and highly-rated. I am budgeting approximately $1000 for publishing and $850 for illustrations, and $150 for incidentals (shipping, displays, advertising, etc).
I already have verbal agreements with the libraries in the Okanagan, as well as the library in Prince George, to carry the book, as they love to support local authors.  Many other local bookstores sell local authors' self-published books, and Books & Co. has agreed to sell Princess Ninja when I can supply them with copies. 
And, of course, there are copies for all of my supportive friends and family!

</div></div>","About me: My name is Jessica Caldas and I am an Atlanta based visual artist and social justice advocate. My work revolves around sharing people’s stories and connecting those stories to the social issues that impact them, including domestic violence, homelessness, sexual assault and more.  I believe viewing larger social and political issues through a personal lens allows various audiences to be drawn in, to accept that the issues impact everyone, and to abandon the notion of “other”.  I am driven by a philosophy that understanding comes through either direct experience or through the sharing of personal narratives  and that by focusing on the extremely personal we can understand and experience something more universal.

About the residency: I was selected in a competitive process to travel to Newcastle, Australia in November to participate in an artist's residency called the Backyard Bus. During this residency I will grow my project, We are all statistics, using community collaboration and art to create awareness, further education, and engage the public with various social issues as they affect their local community.  This is a rare opportunity for me to engage with a new community and to grow my practice in a significant way.  In order to take complete advantage of this opportunity I need your help to reach the full sum I am asking for.


What I'm asking for and what I'm giving you:
 I am asking for a total of $5000. Any amount you can give to reach that goal will help me considerably-every little bit helps!  As a full time artist, it's important that I reach the full sum to cover the complete cost of this residency and the work I will do there. This sum will cover airfare, travel expenses, daily living in Australia, materials for the project and work I do in Australia, materials for what I'm giving to you in return for your generosity, and expenses that occur while I'm away from home.
In return for your contribution, I am offering a lot, and the majority of what I'm giving you are original artworks, often tailored to what you specifically want. Every dollar will help me reach my goal, and so every dollar you give will be rewarded.
(For an abbreviated list of perks, see the side bar to the right, all perks are estimated to be delivered between December 2014 and February 2015) $1 or more= shout out on social media: everyone who contributes to this campaign (unless otherwise specified) will receive a shout out from me on my various social media outlets.  I'm serious when I say every dollar counts.

An image of my installation in Harrisonburg, Virginia


$10 or more=photographic postcard of the work done in Australia: everyone who contributes $10 or more will receive a postcard with an image of my work with a handwritten note from me.
(Delivery of all of the following perks will include social media shout outs as well as a postcard.)

$25=When in Oz... Zine:  For $25, you will receive a hand bound copy of a Zine based on my sketchbook and journal from my time in Australia

Educate Yourself: Violence in Relationships Series: This three print series was inspired by three wheels used to educate people about domestic violence; the power and control wheel, the cycle of violence wheel, and the equality wheel. Each print is a hand pulled, two color, 11x14 inch relief print.

I highly recommend browsing the site and using your own name for the box, as an example, you can check out what definitions have been entered for my name, Jessica.

$500=Commissioned Portrait: I call the portraits I make ""Visual Narratives"" because I'm invested in telling a story, however short or small, about the subject of the portrait.  For $500, I'll create a portrait for you, of whoever you like (you, your dog, your children, or even your favorite celebrity, etc).  The size of the portrait will range between 24 to 36 inches in width and 20 to 40 inches in height.  Pictured above, you can see a few examples of past portraits I've been commissioned to complete.  This process will require extra communication with me, and possibly even a meeting or several to complete.



  


$800=Personalized Hello, my name is... print series:  The first edition of this series was a part of my body of work, Out of Context, and was made about my own various identifiers.  For $800 I'll create a 32 print series of name tags for you, relating to your own experience with identity. Each print in the series is a hand pulled,  6x8 inch, mono type, screen, and relief based print with hand drawn elements. This perk will require additional communication with me to complete.""Barriers to consent"" An example of past prints I have made based on experiences with survivors.

$1000=Work created from survivor stories and interactions during residency: during my time in Australia I'll be interviewing various survivors and advocates about their experiences and based on these interviews I will create unique mono prints.  The sizes of these prints will vary and you will be able to choose from the entire series in the order of when you contributed.


What else should you know about me:
I am an emerging artist which means I'm in the beginning stages of my career.  Still, at this rather early stage I have already gone full time in my practice and work hard to make a living creating.  Recently I was awarded the City of Atlanta's Emerging Artist Award for Visual Arts and was a finalist for the Forward Arts Foundation's Emerging Artist Award.

My work is shown locally and nationally and has been covered in various publications including ArtsAtl, Burnaway, the Creative Loafing, Atlanta Magazine, CommonCreativATL, and the Examiner. On September 1st, my work will be featured in ""Artists to look out for"", a publication released by the Starry Night Retreat.

What is an artist's residency?
Artist residencies are generally opportunities for artists to spend time away from the pressures of daily living in order to focus on their art.

The Backyard Bus is hosted by Emerald Violin and is a project based residency.  The Backyard Bus is located in Newcastle, Australia and seeks artists of any discipline, who are committed to creating work with a strong alignment to health and well-being, social justice and/or community development values.  They provide free accommodation and project support during the residency but do not cover food costs, materials costs, or travel expenses.

During my time in Newcastle I will meet with several organizations I have contacted to learn more first hand about the work they do.  Each of the organizations I meet with will be invited to share data they have collected about their work with me, so that I can use it for installations in public spaces around the city.  These installations are a continuation of my project, We are all statistics.  Additionally, I hope to schedule community conversations and materials with the help of the partner organizations to help increase education and awareness about the issues and the work they do.

In addition to the public art installations, I will invite the organizations to connect me with willing advocates and survivors that are interested in being interviewed. Based on those interviews I will create new prints, and each interviewee will receive a print as thanks for their time and generosity.  For the last three years it has been a huge part of my practice to create images that tell general stories of those affected by various social issues and I am focusing this practice now into individual stories.

Finally, I will continue research for my ongoing body of work Out of Context.  This body of work explores the ways we use language in negative and positive contexts in connection to issues of identity. I am concerned how our behaviors are affected by the use of language, whether used positively or negatively, how we identify with language, how we reclaim it, how we censor it, and what this means for us as individuals and as a community.  I hope to continue this research with regards to the specific community in Newcastle and the languages of Australia particularly.

Have I ever done this kind of public, community engaged work?

Yes! I have done several public art projects through programs like the City of Atlanta's public art project, ELEVATE, the Beltline's Public Art project, and through other residencies.  All of my public art projects have relied on communication and collaboration with local organizations and sought to create awareness about various issues and the organizations that work on those issues in the community.

Have I ever done this kind of intensive residency before?


Yes! I have been selected for various competitive residencies and fellowships in the past, both in and outside of my home base, Atlanta.  All have been incredibly important, and valuable experiences for me where I have grown as an individual and an artist and allowed me to continue to be competitive in my career.  These residencies and fellowships include The Atlanta Printmakers Studio's Emerging Artist Residency, MINT Gallery's Leap Year Residency, WonderRoot's Walthall Fellowship, The Hambidge Center, The Old Furnace Arts Residency, and The Blue Mountain Center.


What is the project, We are all statistics about?

We are all statistics is an ongoing project I began this year.  I wanted to toy with the kind of information and data that the issues I am interested in generate.  In a reversal from examining the larger social impact on an individual and their story, I am interested in how demographic information expresses not only the individual but the group.  For this project I take data concerning a specific issue and community and work to translate that information in a visual way and public way, allowing someone to see the impact the issue has on their community. 
 
The most recent installation of this project occurred in Harrisonburg, Virginia where I collaborated with a local rape prevention and sexual assault awareness organization.  They had helped 152 child victims of abuse and from the data regarding those children I drew 152 hopscotch courts in the downtown area of the town.  During the time I was installing this work, I was able to speak with community members about the project, raise awareness about the issue and the organization's work.  You can read more about that work here.
  
In Atlanta, Georgia I was able to create another installation of this project.  The Atlanta installation represented the more then 2000 victims of intimate partner violence in the city who had filed for temporary protective orders in 2013.  Through a wallpaper pattern I was able to relate the specific demographics of each person and family affected by domestic violence.
In Australia I will expand the installations further and invite communities to join me in the process.",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

//We have big dreams and a sincere vision//
The ICT-Army of Artists is a volunteer based effort whose current mural project has hit walls across Wichita and headlines across America. The first and most recognized mural celebrating the rich history of the North End’s immigrant roots went up last summer. 





Since then, a mural bringing out the richness of Kansas history has gone up in Delano, and another, celebrating the empowerment of women through education and experience, is set to go up in the North End. During the festival, participants will work together to create the ICT-Army of Artists’ first mobile mural celebrating LGBTQ rights and the freedom of identity. This mural will travel around the city and state to churches and other sites that support acceptance of identity and the arts.
 The funding collected through this campaign will be used exclusively to cover costs associated with the production of the festival. We want to present a high quality festival that attracts young audiences from across the city. 
We are committed to local artists, makers and creators, to elevate their businesses and to contribute to the local economy. It is in that spirit that we seek to broaden the horizons of community expression, and setting the precedent a high quality festival and cultural interventions to come.

<p>My passion and vision in the arts often has meant working in a solitary environment, and expressing a personal and vulnerable piece of myself to be viewed. I want to collaborate with other artists and <b>make work that contributes to communities and help provide education to the future artists of our world</b>. </p>

<h3>About the artist</h3>
<p> I grew up in extremely rural Scotland, without electricity or running water, until I attended art college in the city of Glasgow at the age of 16. My love of drawing and painting sprouted at only three years old. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout my art career, I have faced the adversity of the struggling artist. I work very hard creating works of art but to support such creativeness, I sought jobs and opportunities to make ends meet which often pulled me away from the constant creation of my work.</p>
<p><span>As the years raced by, it seemed like I relied heavily on chasing what might sell in an effort to just make a living, keep a roof over my head and food on my table. At that moment, I realized my current situation was stifling my pure expression, exploration of new ideas and personal study as an artist. The world and all of its distractions had me working more and more part-time, non art related jobs for basic financial security<b>.</b> It was most difficult trying to develop my art<b>-</b>making on the side because I could not afford nearly enough time or concentration that the creative art process requires. I started to ask why? nearly every artist I know struggles this way.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
</div><p>Art is vital to our lives, it expresses so much and colors the world we live in so vibrantly. Yet Artists are not valued as they once were in the days of old, when the masterpieces we house in museums today were created.</p><p>Imagine a world without art.</p><p><br/></p><p>I am determined to complete my studies; be the best maker of art I can be; create works of art, connect groups of artists to collaborate, and support each other in a way that will have an impact on connecting communities around the world.</p><div>
<div>
<div>
<br/><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3> <p>Against all odds I was accepted into the prestigious New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture. </p>It was extremely obvious to me that returning to study as a student was the only way that I can accomplish all that needs to be done. It is not only necessary as a matter of learning different techniques, paths of thought and interacting with like-minded peers, but it will allow me to find my own personal style and discover my true identity as a maker of art.</div>
<div>
<p>The school accepted me based on the strength of the work that I produced in their summer program, just one month before classes started. I have almost completed the first 6 months and my work has improved exponentially. I have a gap of time before I can get public assistance and apply for loans. </p>
<p>I haven't been in school in over 20 years! My records are proving hard to acquire from Scotland since the College I attended no longer exists. As a result, I am required to do pre prequalifier 1 year certificate course that will roll into the 2 year Masters in Fine Arts. I need to raise the funds necessary to pay for the last 6 months of my tuition, art supplies and rent. After completion of this initial year, I will be able to apply for loans to help cover the additional MFA 2 years.</p>

<div>Louise Rachel Kerr was born in a very rural part of Scotland and has been painting and drawing from the age of three. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1047497/files/20141125184711-IMG_4758.jpg?1416970031"" src="""" style=""width: 338.21409921671017px; height: 512px;""/></p>
<br/>Growing up with no electricity until she was twelve, art was truly her passion. Both of her parents had been artists and drawing every day was highly encouraged. She was accepted into Art College in Glasgow at the age of sixteen for architecture and fine art. <br/><br/>Moving to New York in 1991, She discovered soft pastel and studied under some of New York’s finest pastel artists, Daniel Greene and Suzanne Young, to name a couple. She was also a member of various art leagues both in Manhattan and Long Island. She started giving live portrait demonstrations in pastel. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1029883/files/20141119122245-KERR.L_2.jpg?1416428565"" src="""" style=""width: 286.7117647058824px; height: 422px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1029890/files/20141119122455-KERR.L_4.jpg?1416428695"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; width: 293.21684210526314px; height: 417px;""/></p>
<p>While living in New York, she was invited to exhibit her work in six Starbucks locations, paving the way for other artists nationwide.</p>Due this exposure, private collectors started purchasing her work.<br/><br/>In 1999 and 2000, she won first prize in pastel for the New York Art League and exhibited in The National Arts Gallery of Manhattan and the Coe Hall Museum on Long Island. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1029894/files/20141119122616-KERR.L_5.jpg?1416428776"" src="""" style=""width: 700.9704918032787px; height: 452px;""/></p>

<br/>In 2005, she moved to California and became a US citizen. she has participated in the local art festivals for which Laguna is famous, has had numerous shows in her own gallery and studio and has been a member of the Laguna Canyon Artist studios since 2007. She is an active participant and donates of work to the Laguna College of Art And Design annually and was featured in American art collector 2013 for the above work titled 'Grey Muskoka day'. <br/>She currently maintains a studio in Laguna Beach and is working on a new body of work in Manhattan at the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture. She is currently studying with Graham Nickson, Judy Glantzman and Ron Milewicz.<br/><br/>The new work is often large scale, combining oil paint and other wet mediums on paper and canvas. <br/>Although primarily figurative, the New York Studio school with its esteemed alumni of artists such as De Kooning,  and Philip Guston, has opened a new abstract nature and exploration.<br/>

My goal while in New York, is to see artists valued and supported as integral parts of a community and help art collectives spring up to connect and brighten the places in which we live. While, I simultaneously complete my masters degree in painting.

My passion and vision in the arts often has meant working in a solitary environment, and expressing a personal and vulnerable piece of myself to be viewed.

I believe being an artist is my calling. I want to do the work that quietly waits inside of me, collaborate with like-minded artists to create large public works on buildings, in parks and in schools.

  The Impact 
Connecting large groups of artists to create public works that better our communities also enhances and gives great creative expansion to everyone involved.
It is my belief that a true artist should be given the opportunity to create art purely from their soul. When an individual is able to express that what is their passion and calling, you experience something profound and are reminded that we can achieve anything, inspire others and live out loud -- with purpose.



For once in all artists lives, they should be able to express and enhance their talents, freely without reservation, not driven by a financial need or what trends demand; but in a collaborative and nurturing environment, that enhances the expansion of both the artist and the work.

Who is Louise Rachel Kerr?
Louise Rachel Kerr was born in a very rural part of Scotland and has been painting and drawing from the age of three. 
Growing up with no electricity until she was twelve, art was truly her passion. Both of her parents had been artists and drawing every day was highly encouraged. She was accepted into Art College in Glasgow at the age of sixteen for architecture and fine art. Moving to New York in 1991, She discovered soft pastel and studied under some of New York’s finest pastel artists, Daniel Greene and Suzanne Young, to name a couple. She was also a member of various art leagues both in Manhattan and Long Island. She started giving live portrait demonstrations in pastel. 
While living in New York, she was invited to exhibit her work in six Starbucks locations, paving the way for other artists nationwide.Due this exposure, private collectors started purchasing her work.In 1999 and 2000, she won first prize in pastel for the New York Art League and exhibited in The National Arts Gallery of Manhattan and the Coe Hall Museum on Long Island. 

In 2005, she moved to California and became a US citizen. she has participated in the local art festivals for which Laguna is famous, has had numerous shows in her own gallery and studio and has been a member of the Laguna Canyon Artist studios since 2007. She is an active participant and donates of work to the Laguna College of Art And Design annually and was featured in American art collector 2013 for the above work titled 'Grey Muskoka day'. She currently maintains a studio in Laguna Beach and is working on a new body of work in Manhattan at the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture. She is currently studying with Graham Nickson, Judy Glantzman and Ron Milewicz.The new work is often large scale, combining oil paint and other wet mediums on paper and canvas. Although primarily figurative, the New York Studio school with its esteemed alumni of artists such as De Kooning,  and Philip Guston, has opened a new abstract nature and exploration.

Minneapolis, when the painter and musician—both originally from the area and friends since 1995—were brainstorming a way to fuse their respective arts. BRUSH|REED

<h2><em><strong>THANKS FOR LOOKING AT THE DREAMCYCLE!</strong></em></h2>
<h3><em><strong>WHO I AM AND WHY I AM DOING THIS?</strong></em></h3>
<p>Thanks for checking out my project! I am Keith. Forever I have loved art and how it affects people.  The power that art has on an individual can be the best! It's free and its REAL.  When someone feels positive emotion from observing a piece of art it is a gift. This intangable gift is why I love art.  The Dreamcycle is einginereed to deliver feelings relaxation and creativity in whoever is observing it.  I invite all these emotions into anyone who chooses to or happens to be around my art project for Burning Man this year Dreamcycle.  </p>
<h3><em><strong>WHAT THE DREAMCYCLE IS</strong></em></h3>
<p>It's devised from Brion Gibson's Dreammachine, a device which Timothy Leary called ""the most sophisticated neuro-phenomenological device ever designed.""  Basically it is created to bring the observer into a state where they experience alpha brainwave functioning.  Alpha-waves are associated with a healthy mind and a stress-free life. For those of us with mentally taxing jobs and stressful lives, Dreamcycle can restore order and relaxation. When your brain operates at this level of electical activity you become overwhelmed with feelings of relaxtion, euphoria, and creativity.  The Dreamcycle stimulates this type of brain functioning through creating a series of patterned lights that flicker due to a rotating cylinder.</p>
<p>The difference in the Dreamcycle and the dreammachine is that the Dreamcycle is in the true Burningman spirit. Its is a mutation that is dwelling into the unknown.  The Dreamcycle cylinder is large enough to sit in and recieve the beneficial light pattern from the intense hot dessert sun.   What is unknown with the Dreamcycle is whether or not the sun's heat interacting with our sense of feeling with enhace the dreamcycle's ability to induce alpha brainwave functioning.  This unknown is very exciting.   </p>
<h3><strong><em>WHAT MAGNITUDE OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS</em></strong></h3>
<p>Contributors can feel good knowing that they are helping to create a sacred space that can have the ability to enrich anyones reality in a positive way.  They can also feel good about contributing to the arts, creativity and the human spirit!  Contributers of $25 up to $100 will get have the option to get any initials welded onto the Dreamcycle.  Contributers of $100 or more will get any name welded onto the project in large easily viewed letters.  This can be your physical mark on the dreamcycle displaying your contribution and support.  Even if you are not going to the playa this you will beable to come in spirit with the Dreamcycle. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><em><strong>WHAT THE DREAMCYCLE NEEDS TO COME TO LIGHT!</strong></em></h3>
<p>The Dreamcyle is being created from almost entirely repurposed material which will keep the cost's down.  This includes almost everything from the steel to gears to bicycle parts, and even the nuts and bolts.  I have done everything in my power to keep this project as cheap as possible and am proud to say that through work trade I have gotten it down to be very inexspensive.   However there are a few purchases, which are to ESSENTIAL the Dreamcycle to be used during the night hours when it is dark wich is the intention with the device.  This is necesarry to keep the project SAFE due to it being located in the open playa at Burnigman.</p>
<p>They are...</p>
<ul>
<li>90 degree gearbox=                                      225$ </li>
<li>60 tooth sproket=                                          30$   </li>
<li>70 ft el wire=                                               60$</li>
<li>Small solar powered lights x 3=                        45$</li>
<li>Large solar powered lights x 2=                       120$</li>
<li>4x8 18 gauge steel x2(for the rotating cylinder)    90$</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><em>THE IMPACT</em></strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Dreamcycle aligns with the observer's naturally occurring alpha brainwaves.  When this happens the alpha wave becomes dominate in the observer.You could achieve the same ""alpha state"" after learning and practicing meditation, or by training yourself with bio-feedback machines, however the Dreamcycle offers you a fantastic light show and relatively quick alpha-wave production. People find that in the past dreamachine therapy and other alpha-wave related therapy lead to decreased anxiety, overall calmness, increases IQ scores, increases in brain hemisphere coordination and overall intellectual function.  When complete the Dreamcycle will be a tool and a portal which can help heal the world through individuals feelings of peace!  Contributers can feel good kowing that they are contributing to this cause and doing their part to help keep Blackrock city safe and a place of expirenmentation.</p>
<p>The more money Dreamcycle can make the more illuminated it can be, wich in turn will draw more attention to it, thus enlighenting more people with its meditative effects!  This is a project geared towards enhancing peoples' experience on this planet! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>
<em><strong>Remember that this goal is a bare minumin for the potential of this project</strong></em>.</h3>
</div>
<p>Any additional money that I can raise will be put to exceptional use to bring the dreamcycle into full potential at Burningman.  The more money I can raise the better and more erotic I can illuminate the Dreamcycle.</p>
<p>Please, If you beleive in my project even if you can't contribute tell all your friends, family, co-workers anyone who is interested in the arts!  And also please come find the Dreamcycle at Burningman this year!  I look forward to seeing you!</p></div>","THANKS FOR LOOKING AT THE DREAMCYCLE!

etch a sketch artist. I started playing with an etch a sketch when I was about 4. My grandma wouldn't let me watch TV all that much when I came over to visit, so I played with my etch a sketch instead. I guess the main difference between me and every other kid is that I never stopped playing with it! My staircases slowly evolved into boxy images and soon I figured out that when you turn both knobs at once, you can make diagonal lines and curves. From that point on, my skills with an etch a sketch grew with my skills as an artist. Since I started taking more seriously to the knobs, I have been blessed with some awesome opportunities. Most recently, I've been invited to show my work at Who's Next, a fashion trade show in Paris. <br/></p><p>This brings me to why I am funding $1000. As I am sure you can imagine, going to Paris isn't cheap! I am prepared to cover my own flight. But I'd like to reach out to you to help me fund my stay in Paris. </p><p>When I was first contacted about this opportunity, I almost passed it up when I learned I'd have to cover my own expenses. But my friends and family got me thinking that maybe it's worth the financial plunge. I'm not expecting to make this money back, even though I'll have a chance to sell my work while there. But opportunity only knocks once. So I might as well answer the door! There will always be more money, but who knows if I'll ever get invited to show my work in Paris again? Even if it's a total bust, I'd rather be able to tell people about that time I went on a crazy excursion to Paris, than to look back on my life and think ""what if?"". I'd feel a fool to deny myself the possibilities that could await me in Paris. </p><p>This will be my first time traveling outside of North America. I'm nervous, but excited! Contributing to this project will allow me to share my art with an entirely new audience. Let's show France what an etch a sketch can really do!<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I need</h3><p>I am looking for $1000 to fund my stay in Paris. I expect to be there for ~6-7 days. The money would cover my lodging, as well as food. This will also cover the cost of some of the promotional materials I will be shipping ahead of time, such as business cards and prints. <br/></p><p>I'm offering all sorts of incentives for those who would like to contribute. I'm offering original etch a sketch art and prints, as well as some original art and prints of my illustrative work. Check them out!!!<br/></p><p>If I don't reach my goal, I will pinch my pennies where I can. I'll find the cheapest baguettes in town! I'll get cozy with strangers in a hostel! I'll try to find plane tickets where I would stay in Paris for less time to save on lodging. But the best tickets I've found allow for about a week of staying in Paris. So I'll do my best to fund like no tomorrow!<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>More About Who's Next<br/>
</h3><p>Here's a link to the trade show: <a href=""http://tradeshows.whosnext.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://tradeshows.whosnext.com/</a></p><p>and the facebook page: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/whosnextpap"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/whosnextpap</a></p><p></p><p>The theme for this year is toy, which is why I was contacted. They'd like to feature my etch a sketch art at a booth during the 
expo. I will also be able to do an etch a sketch
 art piece live that would be completed during my time at the expo. I'd have the opportunity to etch people's portraits live as well. </p><p>The etch-a-sketch was invented in France, and is known as the Telecran. So it's very appropriate that they would like to show my work! </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Please spread the word! The more people who know, the more likely my stay in Paris will be funded. Remember to use Indiegogo share tools! This will better help me promote on this website. <br/></p><p>Also, if anyone happens to know someone who lives in Paris, I'd love to get connected! It would be really great to have someone I could show me the ropes while in Paris. I don't know anyone there! <br/></p><p></p><h3>Where to see my etch a sketch art<br/>

I'd feel a fool to deny myself the possibilities that could await me in Paris. This will be my first time traveling outside of North America. I'm nervous, but excited! Contributing to this project will allow me to share my art with an entirely new audience. Let's show France what an etch a sketch can really do!What I needI am looking for $1000 to fund my stay in Paris. I expect to be there for ~6-7 days. The money would cover my lodging, as well as food. This will also cover the cost of some of the promotional materials I will be shipping ahead of time, such as business cards and prints. I'm offering all sorts of incentives for those who would like to contribute. I'm offering original etch a sketch art and prints, as well as some original art and prints of my illustrative work. Check them out!!!If I don't reach my goal, I will pinch my pennies where I can. I'll find the cheapest baguettes in town! I'll get cozy with strangers in a hostel! I'll try to find plane tickets where I would stay in Paris for less time to save on lodging. But the best tickets I've found allow for about a week of staying in Paris. So I'll do my best to fund like no tomorrow!More About Who's Next
Here's a link to the trade show: http://tradeshows.whosnext.com/and the facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/whosnextpapThe theme for this year is toy, which is why I was contacted. They'd like to feature my etch a sketch art at a booth during the 
expo. I will also be able to do an etch a sketch
 art piece live that would be completed during my time at the expo. I'd have the opportunity to etch people's portraits live as well. The etch-a-sketch was invented in France, and is known as the Telecran. So it's very appropriate that they would like to show my work! Other Ways You Can HelpPlease spread the word! The more people who know, the more likely my stay in Paris will be funded. Remember to use Indiegogo share tools! This will better help me promote on this website. Also, if anyone happens to know someone who lives in Paris, I'd love to get connected! It would be really great to have someone I could show me the ropes while in Paris. I don't know anyone there! Where to see my etch a sketch art
I've got my art all over the internet. Here's a list of websites where I show my work:http://princessetchasketch.com/https://www.facebook.com/princess.etchasketchhttp://pikajane.deviantart.com/http://princessetchasketch.tumblr.com/Here are some select images of my most popular work:     Thank you so much!Let's get this funded by Christmas! :)",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

My Name is Anthony Sirios West, I am an Artist based in the foothills of Northern California. I have been given the privilege of curating Art for Sacred Spaces Village at Burning Man 2014. <div>
<br/><div> This opportunity is very meaningful to me as I owe the rekindling of my artistic passion to Burning Man and the visionary art community. The purpose of money raised is to create a visionary art exhibit inspiring creativity and spiritual awakening, through an exhibit space carefully designed to showcase some of the greatest art and talent that our community has to offer. 
The art will create a visionary gathering place for viewers to exchange conversation, vision, and inspiration to fuel cultural advancement. </div>
<div> Every contribution furthers this project and helps me reach my goal: to exhibit more of the art we all enjoy and love, and to give more new, up and coming artists a chance to showcase their work. 
Art showcased through my curated exhibit at Sacred Spaces will have the opportunity to be viewed, explored, experienced, and discussed by thousands of travelers and other Artists from all over the world, as we gather in celebration of Art and creativity at Burning Man. </div>
<div>The more money I raise the greater the experience can be for the artists and guests.   Further, allowing more time and energy that I can dedicate to the creation of an inspiring experience for those who have the privilege to view and enjoy the exhibit.
The funds raised will help with expenses related to the creation of this curated art space. These include things such as: transportation to the event, set up, lighting, and electricity.  All to bring 30+ pieces of art from 12 different artists, from around the world, to the eyes of countless people in a visionary cultural exchange space.</div>
<div> *Amounts contributed past our goal of $1000 will work to further offset the costs of bringing this experience to the playa and will enable us to bring more lighting and fuel to allow for more art to be exhibited around the Sacred Spaces Village. </div>
<div> PERKS! Brian Paul Smith of fractal alchemy and I have teamed up to bring you all some amazing perks for your contribution. The perks range from one of fractal alchemy's amazing hologram creations to an original painting from me, Anthony Sirios West.  Art is an amazing vehicle for inspiring change and spiritual awaking in not only an individual but the entire world.  Perks bring this Art to your home while you help me bring these Art works to a global audience. </div>
<div> The first time I set foot in the Sacred Spaces Village, at Burning Man, the art brought tears to my eyes. I knew, in that moment that my life would never be the same, and it was my mission to inspire change in the world through my own artwork. Now, I find myself tasked with the creation of the very gallery that brought upon that realization, and I am honored to be able to share my gifts alongside so many other great artists. 
As many of you have no doubt been to the playa before, you can understand what a challenge bringing something like this out to the Burn can be.  However, I am confident in my abilities to overcome any obstacles that I find in my path and bring this inspiring experience to fruition.<span style=""background-color: initial;""> With the help of our amazing community, this will undoubtedly be an inspiring experience for everyone that has a chance to see it.</span>

We have each always felt passionate about sound as a creative medium for expression, so through time we naturally came together at school to play and share our sounds. Through a series of living room jam sessions, open mic nights, and shows on and around campus, we began cultivating rich performative and sonic explorations. </p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""At the RISD Museum Takeover"" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/167/498/34baf1c51488d77a1188e44c76cd5978_large.jpg?1403192952"" src="""" style=""""/> <span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>At the RISD Museum Takeover</i></span></figure><p></p><p>Our sounds have been described as “sonic mayhem,” “rowdy noise,” “crazed,” “dissonant,” “intelligent,” “beautiful,” “lovely,” and “SOO GOOD.” We perform with a mixture of rehearsed songs that soothe your ears and improvised sounds that challenge conventionally clean methods of live performance. We often employ choreographed movements, like belly rolls, to signal a switching of instruments and structuring of our chaos. We encourage audience interaction by leaving instruments and tools out for everyone to play with. We sport fun and goofy costumes that highlight our musical personas. Most of all, we have fun and try to get everyone involved to have fun too. :)</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""At RISD Take a Break"" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/167/927/d274a67c3e9f4d8c8677a7a7f2e4c818_large.JPG?1403198177"" src="""" style=""""/> <span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>At RISD Take a Break</i></span></figure><p></p><p>After playing consistently together during the school year, we decided to continue pursuing our passion post graduation with a stinky Summer endeavor!</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/179/741/aa9b8b6f752edb558696922e7ac25383_large.jpg?1403468632"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p><p>Thus, the <b><i>Stinky Summer Fest</i></b> was born. Or, at least, the idea of it. The ideal goal of the Stinky Summer Fest is to meet a wider audience by traveling across the east coast of the United States in a recreational vehicle and to learn and share the experience of making art with the community.</p><p>We plan on leaving from Providence, RI in mid-July, stopping in various locations like music venues, college campuses, houses, parking lots, and public areas for guerilla-style performances. We’ll stop somewhere, set up our instruments and equipment and fire away with power and interactive energy. After we finish playing for the day, we’ll set up a screen on the side of our vehicle and project student works from RISD’s  <b><i>Film/Animation/Video</i></b>  department. By not charging fees for attendance to the performances or screenings, we are giving people from many different backgrounds access to our music and arts festival. The journey will be documented through audio and video recordings to be used for a conclusive <b><i>Stinky Summer Fest Documentary</i></b>!</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/179/733/9c7a6f0e3bacc5e56cdc31266f6a295d_large.jpg?1403468563"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p><p>We want to see this project come to life because we like the idea that music and movement are universal forms of expression that <b>anyone can be a part of</b>. Creating sound is a communal experience that is not exclusive in any way. How something sounds is simply how something sounds; it is not a good or a bad thing that is loaded with ideology, it is an experience to be shared. Having instruments and materials out for the audience to play is a way of encouraging communal creativity and dissolving the perceived divide between audience and performer -- to share in the creation.

We have each always felt passionate about sound as a creative medium for expression, so through time we naturally came together at school to play and share our sounds. Through a series of living room jam sessions, open mic nights, and shows on and around campus, we began cultivating rich performative and sonic explorations.  At the RISD Museum TakeoverOur sounds have been described as “sonic mayhem,” “rowdy noise,” “crazed,” “dissonant,” “intelligent,” “beautiful,” “lovely,” and “SOO GOOD.” We perform with a mixture of rehearsed songs that soothe your ears and improvised sounds that challenge conventionally clean methods of live performance. We often employ choreographed movements, like belly rolls, to signal a switching of instruments and structuring of our chaos. We encourage audience interaction by leaving instruments and tools out for everyone to play with. We sport fun and goofy costumes that highlight our musical personas. Most of all, we have fun and try to get everyone involved to have fun too. :) At RISD Take a BreakAfter playing consistently together during the school year, we decided to continue pursuing our passion post graduation with a stinky Summer endeavor! Thus, the Stinky Summer Fest was born. Or, at least, the idea of it. The ideal goal of the Stinky Summer Fest is to meet a wider audience by traveling across the east coast of the United States in a recreational vehicle and to learn and share the experience of making art with the community.We plan on leaving from Providence, RI in mid-July, stopping in various locations like music venues, college campuses, houses, parking lots, and public areas for guerilla-style performances. We’ll stop somewhere, set up our instruments and equipment and fire away with power and interactive energy. After we finish playing for the day, we’ll set up a screen on the side of our vehicle and project student works from RISD’s  Film/Animation/Video  department. By not charging fees for attendance to the performances or screenings, we are giving people from many different backgrounds access to our music and arts festival. The journey will be documented through audio and video recordings to be used for a conclusive Stinky Summer Fest Documentary! We want to see this project come to life because we like the idea that music and movement are universal forms of expression that anyone can be a part of. Creating sound is a communal experience that is not exclusive in any way. How something sounds is simply how something sounds; it is not a good or a bad thing that is loaded with ideology, it is an experience to be shared. Having instruments and materials out for the audience to play is a way of encouraging communal creativity and dissolving the perceived divide between audience and performer -- to share in the creation. Bringing this live experience across the country is a way of broadening our perspectives on music, performance, traveling, independence, and ultimately what it means to be artists living and working in the United States.While we have a clear idea of what we want to accomplish, we currently do not have a clear idea of how to get it done without funding.

It is in your hands.""—Toni Morrison</p><p> </p><p>     Hello, my name is Lynne Parks and I’m an artist and curator/organizer in Baltimore City. In this latest project, Birdland and the Anthropocene, artists will be addressing extinction, endangered species, the postnatural, ornithology, and more (I’ve copied my curatorial statement below).  I'm not in the least bit happy about the impending loss of species, but I am excited by the creativity, curiosity and care exhibited in this show which includes visual and sound installations, painting, photography, creative taxidermy, performances, and even a hologram.</p><p>     I’m also the Outreach Coordinator for the bird conservation and wildlife rescue organization, Lights Out Baltimore (LOB).  LOB monitors downtown for building collisions during migration.  Light pollution pulls birds into environments full of invisible, deadly glass. Much of my work encompasses advocating for birds via solo and group shows, curatorial projects, and art-generating community workshops.  Recently, I successfully curated Unfriendly Skies I and II at Goucher College and George Mason University.</p><p>     For Birdland, the first happy news was securing the space at the historic Peale Center.  It's the first purpose-built museum in the United States. The Peale family is regarded as the first family of American art.  They were artists and naturalists.  They gave us portraits of the founding fathers and displays of mastodon skeletons.  I can't think of a more perfect setting for our exhibition.</p><p>     I have also been a long-time birder and over the years I've personally witnessed fewer birds.  The impetus for this show is absence.  That said, we are incorporating a solution center in the museum for the duration of the show.  We have artists who illustrate the dangers of light pollution and buildings design (glass) as relating to birds and building collisions. Two artists have created bird-friendly window film.  We will have joint programming with LOB and Patterson Park Audubon.  <br/><br/>     Community outreach is what makes this real to Baltimoreans.  I'll be giving workshops to city students and with disabled artists at Make Studio--I'm a disabled artist, so I love this partnership.  The workshops will discuss migration, the roles birds play in ecosystems, and threats.  Participants will produce artwork, which will be displayed in the show.  We'll also be collecting stories from Baltimore residents using the Be Here Stories app.  What is your bird story?<br/><br/>     For the duration of the show, weekends will feature performances, as will the opening reception and closing costume party (Halloween weekend).  There will be costumed extinction rituals, concerts, open mic with guest readers, lectures, and more.  Some TBA.  So many will communicate what birds mean to them.  This show is about love.<br/><br/>     I should add that given the seriousness of the show, we offer moments of levity.  Some of it might have something to do with bird poop.<br/><br/>     Surely, with all of this energy we can find ways to mitigate the worst effects of The Anthropocene.  This show feels like a culminating moment to me.  It’s eight years of work and community--arts and bird conservation coming together.  I'm very grateful for this opportunity.<br/><br/>     We need your help!  Shipping and transportation costs from ten U.S. cities and The Hague plus truck rentals in the region add up to $2,725.   We also have an additional $1,000 in materials costs considering we have to paint, drape windows and doorways, make costumes, and hang (hardware).  Parking in downtown Baltimore will cost hundreds of dollars.  This is a year’s worth of work for me, and a curatorial stipend would certainly defray some of my personal costs.  Artists should at least receive $250 stipends.  We work so hard.  Frankly, your contributions will make this show happen and support the creative efforts of everyone involved.  The money we raise will first go toward covering expenses, but will then be shared equitably among the artists.  More money means better deserved payments.  You can also help by sharing this campaign!<br/><br/>     As far as the logistics go, there is a lot of experience collected in this bunch.  These artists have installed many times over.  The Peale has not been renovated and it’s quirky, but Submersive Productions are great friends who have shared their knowledge of the building and they’ve donated a lighting designer.  I’ll be putting out a call for interns from the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA).<br/><br/>Perks!  Cathy Cook and I will be offering prints and Jonathan Latiano will offer sculptural elements from past installations. </p><p> </p><p>Exhibition hours:</p><p>Thursdays and Fridays 6-9pm; Saturdays 12-6pm; Sundays 10-4pm from October 6-29, 2017<br/>Opening Reception, Oct. 6, 6-10 p.m. with performances<br/>Closing Costume Party, Oct. 28, 7 p.m. until late<br/><br/>Saturday programs, Rotating artist talks at 2 p.m.<br/>Oct. 7 Benjamin Andrew, Christina Baal, Chris Siron<br/>Oct. 14  Jieyu Zhang, Lynne Parks <br/>Oct. 21 Cathy Cook, Elisabeth Pellathy, Nicole Shiflet, Ben Piwowar</p><p>Saturday 14 at noon.  Lindsay Jacks, Director of Lights Out Baltimore</p><p>Sunday noon programs: <br/>Oct. 8 Open mic referencing birds.

La pieza central de esta transformación será un mural panorámico masivo de 175 pies de largo del reconocido artista del norte de Portland, David Carmack Lewis.Pero no podemos lograr que esto suceda sin su ayuda.Mr. Lewis has been given complete artistic control over the concept and design. As photographers, we appreciate that great art is created by artists, not by clients or committees.Mr. Lewis' work was recently featured in a solo show at the Coos Art Museum. He is a Ford Family Foundation grant recipient for his exhibition on fire and fossil fuels. His work has been represented in galleries and juried shows throughout the American West. His mural, ""The Big Back Yard"" was selected to represent Idaho in Parade Magazine's article ""Murals Across America: The Very Best Street Art in Every State"" and his most recent mural, ""Over the Valley"", was the subject of the short documentary film ""COVID Landscape"" by Feat1stFilms, a featured selection of the 2020 Short Documentary Film Festival.(See our FAQs to learn more about the artist's concept for this project.)El señor Lewis ha recibido control artístico completo sobre el concepto y el diseño. Como fotógrafos, apreciamos que el gran arte sea creado por artistas, no por clientes o comités.Las obras del Sr. Lewis se presentaron recientemente en una exposición individual enel Coos Art Museum. Es un beneficiario de la subvención de la Ford Family Foundation por una exposición sobre el fuego y los combustibles fósiles. Su trabajo ha sido expuesto en galerías y espectáculos con jurado en todo el oeste americano. Su mural “The Big Back Yard” fue elegido para representar al estado de Idaho en el artículo de Parade Magazina titulado ""Murals Across America: The Very Best Street Art in Every State"" y su mural más reciente ""Over the Valley"", fue el sujeto del cortometraje documental de Feat1stFilms ""COVID Landscape"", una selección destacada del Festival de Cortometrajes Documentales 2020.(Consulte nuestras preguntas frecuentes para obtener más información sobre el concepto del artista para este proyecto). What We Need & What You GetAll funds will first be applied to the necessary expenses in the order in which they occur: Wall preparation, paints and supplies, lift rental, insurance, and anti-graffiti coating. The artist will contribute most of his usual fee as an in-kind donation. Additional funds raised will help to partially compensate him for his time. He will be spending nearly every day for two months on a truly monumental piece of public art that will become an iconic part of the historic downtown St. Johns business district.As a thank you for your donation, we are offering a variety of perks, including fine art prints and some schwag from Blue Moon Camera & Machine.

It has long lain fallow with overlooked potential. Frankly, it has been a bit of an eyesore, an unfortunate circumstance for the students across the street. We see it as a giant blank canvas. We have already made significant improvements, including new curbside trees and elegant ""billboard-style"" lighting. It is our hope that the mural will establish this intersection as a centerpiece of the St. Johns community and an inspiration for generations of young minds. El impactoLa esquina de North Kellogg Street y North John Avenue, donde se pintará el mural, se encuentra directamente frente a la Escuela Primaria James John. Tiene un largo barbecho con un potencial pasado por alto. Francamente, ha sido un dolor de ojos, una circunstancia desafortunada para los estudiantes al otro lado de la calle. Lo vemos como un lienzo gigante en blanco.Ya hemos realizado mejoras significativas, incluyendo nuevos árboles en la acera y una elegante iluminación de ""estilo de cartelera"". Esperamos que el mural establezca esta intersección como una pieza central de la comunidad de St. Johns y una inspiración para generaciones de mentes jóvenes. Risks and ChallengesDelays and unexpected hiccups in projects of this scale are inevitable.  Based on our long-term relationship with the artist, and his extensive history of completing challenging projects just like this one, we have every confidence that we will make this happen. Mr. Lewis brings the experience and commitment necessary to accomplishing a huge project such as this.When it’s finished, we hope that you’ll have a chance to visit.  We want you to see what you helped create, and that it was worth every penny.   Riesgos y desafíosLas demoras y los contratiempos inesperados en proyectos de esta escala son inevitables.

<p><i>Ny lokstallsägare - Åsa Maria Hedberg - som behöver lite starthjälp</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Bakgrund</h3>
<p>Jag är yrkesverksam som konstnär-keramiker-glaskonstnär på heltid med mitt företag i Hammerdal. Hit flyttade vi 2013 från Östersund men ursprungligen kommer jag från Härnösand.</p>
<p>Jag har den stora äran och glädjen att få ta över gamla lokstallet!</p>
<p>Jag är passionerat förtjust i Hammerdals gamla lokstall och ända sedan jag fick syn på fastigheten har jag jobbat stenhårt för att rädda och använda lokstallet till eftervärlden, till byborna, till turisters glädje och till konstskapande!! </p>
<p>Indiegogos webplattform tvingar mig att använda engelska rubriker men all annan text är på svenska. Dessutom används dollar med automatik men summorna är översatta till kronor. Beloppen har dock viss felmarginal då decimaler ej tillåts. Jag ber om överseende med detta.</p>
<p>Det här crowdfundingprojektet är första försöket att hitta ekonomi till det mest akuta i min vision... till att RÄDDA LOKSTALLET! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Framtidsvisionen:</h3>
<h3>LOKSTALLET FIRE &amp;HEART</h3>
<h3>- heta tekniker, heta möten</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473446078/o9ld6uesosg8rdf2wmr4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>LOKSTALLET FIRE &amp; HEART handlar om heta tekniker och hjärtliga möten människor emellan</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ett internationellt och lokalt konstskaparcentrum där huvudmaterialen är lera och glas.</strong></p>
<p>I och med lokstallets rymd och volym skapas <i>möjlighet till monumentalskulpterande </i>med hjälp av travers för runtflyttande av skulpturer och material. En inplanerad gångbrygga vid innertakets nedre kant ska möjliggöra att skapandet kan utföras likaväl uppifrån och ner som från golvet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ett inre kursrum i långskeppet...</strong></p>
<p>...skapar möjligheter till såväl nybörjarkurser i keramik och glas, men siktet är också inställt på samarbete med högskolor och universitet i Sverige och internationellt. Visionen är att kortare fortbildningar på kandidat- och magisternivå förläggs till lokstallet i Hammerdal.</p>
<p>Här finns redan visat intresse att förlägga sommar- och kortkurser till lokstallet när allt är klart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>LIVE-sändningar från lokstallets kursverksamhet och workshops</strong></p>
<p>Workshops och kurser ska hålla hög kvalitét och kommer att websändas live i realtid. På så sätt möjliggörs deltagande från annan ort. Vid nästa tillfälle kommer hen att se till att vara på plats i Hammerdal!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473529743/mdwmnzivzcum842dvj93.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Kurser och workshops för både yrkesverksamma och hobbyskapare</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Hållbart skapande och miljöfrågor i fokus från start</b></p>
<p>Satsningen på LOKSTALLET FIRE &amp; HEART kommer redan från grunden att byggas på och kring hållbara lösningar där skapandets miljöpåverkan ska minimeras. Det här blir en unik satsning där allt från ombyggnation till uppbyggnad av ett första verksamhetsprojekt helt ska genomsyras av miljökloka överväganden. Idag finns inget keramik/glascentrum som helt fokuserar på miljöaspekten i skapandet.</p>
<p>Skulpturparken ska även förstärka livskvalitéten och miljön för alla som bor i Hammerdal och för besökare. Olika vårdträd ska planteras och frukt och bär ska vara allas att smaka. En markanalys är gjord för att säkerställa att jorden inte är smutsad av den tidigare verksamheten. Inget fanns att anmärka.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Artist in Residence/mindre sittningar/skisslya i tornet</strong></p>
<p>I torndelen kommer att finnas ett minipentry och handikappanpassad WC med dusch och längst upp i tornet ett litet krypin som ska rymma ett resurs- och materialbibliotek runt om de fyra väggarna med samlad fakta om keramik- och glaskonst i arkitektur och landskap. Här finns även plats för mindre sittningar/samtal/skisslya. Planen är att inreda så att en gästföreläsare/artist in residence ska kunna övernatta kortare tider då hen är inhyst för att arbeta i lokstallets workshop/ateljé.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473529692/r27dbezupsrsjt7a5aek.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Hammerdals vackraste byggnad, torndelen i kvällssol</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Minicafé - saluhylla - kika in i verksamheten </strong></p>
<p>Nere i långskeppet kommer man som gäst att mötas av ett minikafé med kaffemaskin och enkelt tilltugg, en säljdisk och förhoppningsvis en anställd värd/ugnstekniker/vaktmästare. Väljer man att stanna kvar inne i lokstallet kommer man ofta att kunna beskåda glasblåseri/varmformning av glas/monumentalskulptur i lera eller andra material. En annan dag är det storformatsteckning på gång. Det kommer alltid att vara något nytt som händer utifrån vilka konstnärer som är inhysta!</p>
<p>Undertecknad kommer som ägare av lokstallet att vara den konstnär som oftast är på plats och arbetar, men tanken att i perioder kunna öppna upp för fler att hyra in sig känns fantastisk.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473439399/hiogfrh1azfoyhzdudy4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Ett minikafé planeras i lokstallets entré</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Internationell skulpturpark med fokus på stora verk i glas och keramik</strong></p>
<p>Tar man sig en fika och går ut kommer man att kunna sätta sig på någon av alla de trevliga sittplatser som skapas runt lokstallet i den lilla blivande skulpturparken. Tanken är att det vartannat år ska tillkomma en ny monumentalskulptur som ett nytt tillskott till parken. Varannan gång en häftig keramisk skulptur och varannan gång en läcker glasskulptur av en internationellt erkänd konstnär. Detta är en hjärtesak för mig att driva; keramik- och glas i offentliga rum är så eftersatt i den svenska stadsbilden och till viss del även inomhus. Ofta är inköpare felaktigt rädda att keramik och glas inte ska hålla - man inte kunskaper om hur skulpturerna ska skapas för att klara väder och vind. Det vill jag ändra på!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Vad får Hammerdal tillbaka genom LOKSTALLET FIRE &amp; HEART?</strong></p>
<p>Jag tänker mig att ett öppet konstskaparcentrum mitt i Hammerdal kommer att skapa positiva värden i många led. Förhoppningen är ju att alla ska känna sig välkomna, att det ska bli en mötespunkt för att ta en enklare fika och att resenärer och turister extra gärna stannar till i vår by.</p>
<p>Grunden i att ha ett stabilt öppethållande och en öppen park tror jag kan skapa en känsla av att lokstallet lyfts från sjabbig bakgård där vem som helst bryter sig in och klottrar och pangar rutor - till en stolthet för oss alla. </p>
<p>Huvudplanen är att kunna smygöppna hösten 2018...!</p>

<h3>Vad behövs det pengar till - och vad du får i gengäld:</h3>
<p>Projektet att få LOKSTALLET räddat, renoverat och rustat för nytt bruk kan ses som tre delar:</p>
<p>1. DAGSAKUTA KOSTNADER: Avstyckningskostnader, lagfart, informationsmaterial och skyltning/belysning/slyröjning/robotklippare</p>
<p>2. AKUTA OCH MINDRE AKUTA BYGGNADSVÅRDSÅTGÄRDER; både exteriört och interiört. Här är ett takbyte, renovering av fönster/dörrar/tegel det allra mest akuta som kommer att prioriteras omgående.</p>
<p>3. ICKE AKUTA KOSTNADER - men som behövs för i helhetsvisionen: Maskinparkskomplettering, första storskaliga skulpturen ute i parken och kaffemaskin</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A och O för att kunna komma någon vart är att lokstallet med tomt styckas av från lägenhetshusen som hör till samma fastighet. Lantmäteriet har nämnt en vag siffra på cirka 55000 kronor för detta, en summa jag idag inte har till övers. Då det är en engångsmöjlighet att ta tag i att rädda lokstallet från att rasa ihop (taket på norra långskeppet och torndelen är i riktigt dåligt skick) vill jag greppa chansen. </p>
<p>Lantmäteriet har i dagarna påbörjat sitt ärende med avstyckningen av lokstallet med tillhörande markyta (för kommande skulpturpark). Då jag nu har köpekontrakt på fastigheten kommer jag att så fort medel finns att sätta igång med skriande välbehövlig byggnadsvård av lokstallet.</p>
<p>Under hösten 2015 fick jag ett 90 %-igt stöd från länsstyrelsen Jämtlands kulturavdelning för ett åtgärdsprogram som sedan genomfördes av Jamtlis byggnadsvårdsbolag. Här hittar du en länk till dokumentet som i detalj beskriver lokstallets skick och förslag till varsam renovering och ombyggnation utifrån den nya planerade användningen:</p>

<p><i>Jamtli på plats senhösten/vintern 2015 för att gå igenom skicket på lokstallet</i></p>
<p>Kjell Gisterå, arkitekt på GisteråSjöstrand, fanns med i processen och har ritat in hur lokstallet ska bli användbart året om som ett skaparcentrum med monumentalateljé för huvudsakligen glas och keramikkonst. Lokstallet har idag inget golv, vatten och avlopp, toalett eller liknande. Allt detta grundläggande och därtill en kurslokal, förvaringsutrymme, pentry, handikapptoalett med dusch, entresolplan och resursbibliotek och övernattningslya/kurslokal i tornet finns inritat här.</p>

<p><i>Del av de framtagna arkitektskisserna för ombyggnationen av lokstallet</i></p>
<p>Ombyggnationen är kostnadsberäknad till lite drygt tre miljoner kronor. Därtill tillkommer bland annat kostnader för stensättning framför fastigheten, investeringar i miljöteknik och viss markberedning med mera i skulpturparken.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473498972/lgpvqr4wl11jo1thpfke.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Bufferthålen i mellanväggen och andra historiska detaljer i lokstallet sparas i ombyggnationen (Se filmen för att få höra Torsten Nilsson, 94, berätta hur bufferthålen kom till...!)</i></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Kostnader som insamlingen gäller</h3>
<p>Här följer en lista med kostnader för olika delar av lokstallets upprustning och omdaning, men innan du kikar på den vill jag göra ett förtydligande angående denna insamlingskampanj:</p>
<p>Varenda krona som kan samlas in här och nu behövs - i första hand till att täcka själva avstyckningen och övriga kostnader under punkt ett ovan.</p>
<p>Jag är inte så naiv att jag räknar med att Hammerdarlingarna och andra utsocknes vänner och lokstallsfantaster kommer att kunna/vilja täcka <i>hela</i> det ekonomiska behovet för lokstallet - här finns fler idéer kring var det skulle kunna finnas ekonomiska medel till genomförandet.</p>
<p><strong>SKULLE det däremot ramla in större summor kommer dessa att direkt täcka renovering i den ordning som det är akut. Konstigare saker har hänt förut - och den stora drömmen vore att taket kunde byggas om bums och fönstren lagas så att inte vädret fortsätter att tära på huset.</strong></p>
<p>Ju längre den här insamlingen når, desto närmare är Hammerdal ett räddat lokstall som innehåller konstnärlig öppen aktivitet, en öppen skulpturpark och ett minifik.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>KOSTNADER - i detalj:</h3>
<p>(Några siffror utelämnade - det går naturligtvis att få veta mer!)</p>
<p><strong>TAKET PÅ LÅNGSKEPPET och TAKET PÅ TORNET</strong> skulle ha behövt bytas senast för ett par år sedan och det är osäkert vilken vinter de kommer att ramla in. Att byta tak är absolut prioritet ett. Jag skulle skatta min lyckliga stjärna om det redan nu kom in tillräckligt mycket pengar så detta kunde genomföras under vintern/tidig vår.  Prel kostnad:  610 000 kr. (I den summan ingår allt arbete inklusive plåt- och skorstenslagningar, material, byggställning.)</p>
<p><strong>FÖNSTER och DÖRRAR</strong> som inte vinden blåser rakt igenom och som fungerar att öppna och stänga, skulle jag skatta som absolut prio nr 2. Prel kostnad: 140 000 kr.</p>
<p><strong>REKONSTRUKTION av PORTEN</strong> som nu är helt skranglig och står och slår med trasiga rutor. Prel kostnad: 100 000 kr. </p>
<p><strong>MURNING och LAGNING</strong> av krön, stenar, puts av innerväggar. Prel kostnad: 227 000 kr.</p>
<p><strong>GOLV, VATTEN och AVLOPP</strong> (bland annat så de som arbetar i lokstallet ska kunna gå på toa!) känns som tredje prioritet. Fortfarande på rätt akut nivå för att överhuvud taget kunna använda lokstallet och hålla öppet. Prel kostnad:  660 000 kr.</p>
<p><strong>VARMBONAD KURSLOKAL plus PENTRY</strong> där lera och kursdeltagare inte fryser hamnar bortåt nummer fyra. Prel kostnad: 380 000 kr.</p>
<p><strong>ENTRESOLPLAN</strong> med lagringsutrymme och passage upp till övre tornrummet. Prel kostnad: 400 000 kr.</p>
<p><strong>BJÄLKLAG</strong> i tornrummets nya golv. Prel kostnad: 38 000 kr.</p>
<p><strong>SKYLTNING och INFORMATION</strong> utförd av Jamtli mm. Prel kostnad: 19 500 kr.</p>
<p><strong>KAFFEMASKIN och MINIKAFÉ</strong> i lokstallets entré skulle jag önska mig redan till nästa sommar - men det kan inte prioriteras så högt... tak och golv måste komma före kafferep. Men vänta bara, det kommer det också.  Ej kostnadssatt.</p>
<p><strong>STENSÄTTNING</strong> och iläggning av två järnvägsspårsnuttar för att visa historiens vingslag framför entréportarna. Det kan bara hända om jag får ruskigt mycket pengar över eller om någon skulle få lust att skänka några ton med smågatsten och räls. Man vet ju aldrig! Ej kostnadssatt.</p>

<h3>PERK betyder lockbete och tackgåva i ett ord<span style=""display: none;""> </span>
</h3>
<p>Ett crowdfundingprojekt går ut på att de som backar upp insamlingen ekonomiskt också får någon sorts så kallad 'PERK' - en tackpresent. För att undvika att pengarna jag samlar in blir skattepliktiga får dessa bara vara av mindre värde jämfört med summan som betalas in. De får heller inte vara av en karaktär som jag i övrigt skulle kunna sälja i min verksamhet, allt enligt Skatteverkets regler.</p>
<p>Jag har satt ihop en rad olika belöningar som du kan välja på för olika sponsringsbelopp. Tanken är att det ska kännas som en gott-och-blandat-påse med godsaker. Mycket att välja på; vilken är din favorit? Kanske vill du ha två eller flera godsaker?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Även små stöd är viktiga - allt räknas dubbelt:</h3>
<p>Du behöver inte känna dig dålig om du så bara skulle backa upp projektet med en krona eller en tia om det är vad du kan ge. Det finns en stor poäng i om du ändå vill göra det!</p>
<p>Det är nämligen så att den här insamlingen också kommer att visa på ANTALET PERSONER som deltar och backar upp projektet. Då syns det att det här är en jätteviktig satsning som si eller så många faktiskt vill se hända och jag har 'på fötter' när jag ska söka medel från andra håll. Tänk om det gick att visa att exempelvis 70% av alla som bor i Hammerdal/Jämtland (och bortom) vill att detta ska bli av. Eller att si och så många yrkesverksamma längtar efter att få komma till lokstallet på kurs när det är färdigt...</p>

<h3>Framtiden med LOKSTALLET FIRE &amp; HEART</h3>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<p>Parallellt med det här första försöket att hitta ekonomi för ombyggnationen av lokstallet söks medel för en förstudie och ett första verksamhetsprojekt kallat 'LOKSTALLET FIRE &amp; HEART - heta tekniker, heta möten'. Tanken är att kunna starta upp driften i ett spännande verksamhetsprojekt direkt när själva byggnaden står renoverad och klar. </p>

<h3>Utmaningar, kritik och tänkbara svar</h3>
<p>Som alla förstår finns det saker som kan sätta käppar i hjulet för den här typen av satsning. Det mest uppenbara är naturligtvis att jag inte hittar de summor som krävs för att få igång den upprustning och verksamhet som är planerad. Men här har jag långt kvar till vägs ände - tvärtom har jag ju bara börjat.</p>
<p>Någon kanske tänker:</p>
<p>- Varför ska vi backa upp henne, hon är ju bara en av alla oss företagare i byn, varför ska vi vara med och betala just hennes satsning? Frågan är relevant och korrekt. Men det finns skäl:</p>
<p>Jag har drivit frågan om att något ska hända med lokstallet i drygt tre års tid och lagt otaliga obetalda timmar på att komma till den punkt när jag tar över fastigheten. Jag har spottat in mer pengar än jag tänker berätta i sammanhanget utan att kunna tjäna en enda krona på det. Bland annat för att jag inte vill bo i en by som inte gör något åt ett förfallande lokstall. Så här kan vi ju inte ha det!</p>
<p>Det finns mängder av andra personer i Hammerdal som har haft planer för lokstallet som aldrig blev av. Av någon fantastisk anledning har jag blivit betrodd med att ta över fastigheten. Det är nu eller aldrig det händer. Nu finns chansen att hjälpa till om man på riktigt tycker att det skulle vara viktigt för byn att vårt vackraste hus tas om hand.</p>
<p>Slutligen kan man ju tycka att det är oskäligt att ekonomiskt backa upp en enskild individs blivande ateljé. Siktet är visserligen inställt på en ateljé jag också kommer att förlägga mitt privata skapande - men överlag som min vision ser ut kommer det att i allra högsta grad sprida ekonomiska fördelar och även en del pur glädje till byn. </p>
<p>En poäng till finns att göra. Min vision för lokstallet kommer nog alltid att ge mer tillbaka till byn och andra besökare än vad jag kommer att plocka ut i reda pengar. Inte den mest lukrativa planen ekonomiskt kanske, men förhoppningsvis en av de mer byabefrämjande planerna för lokstallet?!</p>

<h3>Det finns OLIKA sätt att hjälpa till! </h3>
<p>Som yrkesverksam konstnär har jag full förståelse för att alla människor inte har råd att stödja lokstallsprojektet med ekonomiska medel. Men det finns ett antal andra saker du gärna får hjälpa till med istället:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ett hett tips är att sprida ordet om att detta crowdfundingprojekt/denna insamling nu är påbörjad! Berätta gärna muntligt till släkt och vänner om projektet. En annan bra sak är om du har möjlighet att sprida informationen digitalt. Det gör du lättast genom att gilla och dela inlägg på Facebook/Twitter/Instagram osv. Ju fler som vet om insamlingen och dess mål och syfte/framtidsvision desto fler kan tänkas vilja bidra.</li>
<li>Kampanjen pågår bara några veckor så det är viktigt att informationen sprids SNABBT.</li>
<li>Sitter du på smågatsten/annan marksten eller ett par snuttar av riktig järnvägsräls som du vill skänka så tar jag tacksamt emot dem! Det gör inget om jag får sten i olika former och storlekar bara det är just sten. Mosaik är inte ett problem utan en konstnärlig möjlighet!</li>

The Swedish Land Survey Authority has mentioned a vague figure of around 55,000 SEK for this - 6348 US$, a sum I do not have today. As this is a once in a life time possibility when the apartments are sold, I feel I need to grab the opportunity. But the roof on the north nave and tower portion is in a really bad condition, this is the last chance to save the building...</p><p>The process of subdivision of the estate has just begun.

Ny lokstallsägare - Åsa Maria Hedberg - som behöver lite starthjälp
 
Bakgrund
Jag är yrkesverksam som konstnär-keramiker-glaskonstnär på heltid med mitt företag i Hammerdal. Hit flyttade vi 2013 från Östersund men ursprungligen kommer jag från Härnösand.
Jag har den stora äran och glädjen att få ta över gamla lokstallet!
Jag är passionerat förtjust i Hammerdals gamla lokstall och ända sedan jag fick syn på fastigheten har jag jobbat stenhårt för att rädda och använda lokstallet till eftervärlden, till byborna, till turisters glädje och till konstskapande!! 
Indiegogos webplattform tvingar mig att använda engelska rubriker men all annan text är på svenska. Dessutom används dollar med automatik men summorna är översatta till kronor. Beloppen har dock viss felmarginal då decimaler ej tillåts. Jag ber om överseende med detta.
Det här crowdfundingprojektet är första försöket att hitta ekonomi till det mest akuta i min vision... till att RÄDDA LOKSTALLET! 
 
Framtidsvisionen:
LOKSTALLET FIRE &HEART
- heta tekniker, heta möten

LOKSTALLET FIRE & HEART handlar om heta tekniker och hjärtliga möten människor emellan
 
Ett internationellt och lokalt konstskaparcentrum där huvudmaterialen är lera och glas.
I och med lokstallets rymd och volym skapas möjlighet till monumentalskulpterande med hjälp av travers för runtflyttande av skulpturer och material. En inplanerad gångbrygga vid innertakets nedre kant ska möjliggöra att skapandet kan utföras likaväl uppifrån och ner som från golvet.
 
Ett inre kursrum i långskeppet...
...skapar möjligheter till såväl nybörjarkurser i keramik och glas, men siktet är också inställt på samarbete med högskolor och universitet i Sverige och internationellt. Visionen är att kortare fortbildningar på kandidat- och magisternivå förläggs till lokstallet i Hammerdal.
Här finns redan visat intresse att förlägga sommar- och kortkurser till lokstallet när allt är klart.
 
LIVE-sändningar från lokstallets kursverksamhet och workshops
Workshops och kurser ska hålla hög kvalitét och kommer att websändas live i realtid. På så sätt möjliggörs deltagande från annan ort. Vid nästa tillfälle kommer hen att se till att vara på plats i Hammerdal!

Kurser och workshops för både yrkesverksamma och hobbyskapare
 
Hållbart skapande och miljöfrågor i fokus från start
Satsningen på LOKSTALLET FIRE & HEART kommer redan från grunden att byggas på och kring hållbara lösningar där skapandets miljöpåverkan ska minimeras. Det här blir en unik satsning där allt från ombyggnation till uppbyggnad av ett första verksamhetsprojekt helt ska genomsyras av miljökloka överväganden. Idag finns inget keramik/glascentrum som helt fokuserar på miljöaspekten i skapandet.
Skulpturparken ska även förstärka livskvalitéten och miljön för alla som bor i Hammerdal och för besökare. Olika vårdträd ska planteras och frukt och bär ska vara allas att smaka. En markanalys är gjord för att säkerställa att jorden inte är smutsad av den tidigare verksamheten. Inget fanns att anmärka.
 
Artist in Residence/mindre sittningar/skisslya i tornet
I torndelen kommer att finnas ett minipentry och handikappanpassad WC med dusch och längst upp i tornet ett litet krypin som ska rymma ett resurs- och materialbibliotek runt om de fyra väggarna med samlad fakta om keramik- och glaskonst i arkitektur och landskap. Här finns även plats för mindre sittningar/samtal/skisslya. Planen är att inreda så att en gästföreläsare/artist in residence ska kunna övernatta kortare tider då hen är inhyst för att arbeta i lokstallets workshop/ateljé.

Minicafé - saluhylla - kika in i verksamheten 
Nere i långskeppet kommer man som gäst att mötas av ett minikafé med kaffemaskin och enkelt tilltugg, en säljdisk och förhoppningsvis en anställd värd/ugnstekniker/vaktmästare. Väljer man att stanna kvar inne i lokstallet kommer man ofta att kunna beskåda glasblåseri/varmformning av glas/monumentalskulptur i lera eller andra material. En annan dag är det storformatsteckning på gång. Det kommer alltid att vara något nytt som händer utifrån vilka konstnärer som är inhysta!
Undertecknad kommer som ägare av lokstallet att vara den konstnär som oftast är på plats och arbetar, men tanken att i perioder kunna öppna upp för fler att hyra in sig känns fantastisk.

Ett minikafé planeras i lokstallets entré
 
Internationell skulpturpark med fokus på stora verk i glas och keramik
Tar man sig en fika och går ut kommer man att kunna sätta sig på någon av alla de trevliga sittplatser som skapas runt lokstallet i den lilla blivande skulpturparken. Tanken är att det vartannat år ska tillkomma en ny monumentalskulptur som ett nytt tillskott till parken. Varannan gång en häftig keramisk skulptur och varannan gång en läcker glasskulptur av en internationellt erkänd konstnär. Detta är en hjärtesak för mig att driva; keramik- och glas i offentliga rum är så eftersatt i den svenska stadsbilden och till viss del även inomhus. Ofta är inköpare felaktigt rädda att keramik och glas inte ska hålla - man inte kunskaper om hur skulpturerna ska skapas för att klara väder och vind. Det vill jag ändra på!
 
Vad får Hammerdal tillbaka genom LOKSTALLET FIRE & HEART?
Jag tänker mig att ett öppet konstskaparcentrum mitt i Hammerdal kommer att skapa positiva värden i många led. Förhoppningen är ju att alla ska känna sig välkomna, att det ska bli en mötespunkt för att ta en enklare fika och att resenärer och turister extra gärna stannar till i vår by.
Grunden i att ha ett stabilt öppethållande och en öppen park tror jag kan skapa en känsla av att lokstallet lyfts från sjabbig bakgård där vem som helst bryter sig in och klottrar och pangar rutor - till en stolthet för oss alla. 
Huvudplanen är att kunna smygöppna hösten 2018...!


Långskepp på lokstallet och del av blivande skulpturpark
 
Vad behövs det pengar till - och vad du får i gengäld:
Projektet att få LOKSTALLET räddat, renoverat och rustat för nytt bruk kan ses som tre delar:
1. DAGSAKUTA KOSTNADER: Avstyckningskostnader, lagfart, informationsmaterial och skyltning/belysning/slyröjning/robotklippare
2. AKUTA OCH MINDRE AKUTA BYGGNADSVÅRDSÅTGÄRDER; både exteriört och interiört. Här är ett takbyte, renovering av fönster/dörrar/tegel det allra mest akuta som kommer att prioriteras omgående.
3. ICKE AKUTA KOSTNADER - men som behövs för i helhetsvisionen: Maskinparkskomplettering, första storskaliga skulpturen ute i parken och kaffemaskin
 
A och O för att kunna komma någon vart är att lokstallet med tomt styckas av från lägenhetshusen som hör till samma fastighet. Lantmäteriet har nämnt en vag siffra på cirka 55000 kronor för detta, en summa jag idag inte har till övers. Då det är en engångsmöjlighet att ta tag i att rädda lokstallet från att rasa ihop (taket på norra långskeppet och torndelen är i riktigt dåligt skick) vill jag greppa chansen. 
Lantmäteriet har i dagarna påbörjat sitt ärende med avstyckningen av lokstallet med tillhörande markyta (för kommande skulpturpark). Då jag nu har köpekontrakt på fastigheten kommer jag att så fort medel finns att sätta igång med skriande välbehövlig byggnadsvård av lokstallet.
Under hösten 2015 fick jag ett 90 %-igt stöd från länsstyrelsen Jämtlands kulturavdelning för ett åtgärdsprogram som sedan genomfördes av Jamtlis byggnadsvårdsbolag. Här hittar du en länk till dokumentet som i detalj beskriver lokstallets skick och förslag till varsam renovering och ombyggnation utifrån den nya planerade användningen:
http://media.asamariahedberg.se/2016/03/%C3%85t...

Jamtli på plats senhösten/vintern 2015 för att gå igenom skicket på lokstallet
Kjell Gisterå, arkitekt på GisteråSjöstrand, fanns med i processen och har ritat in hur lokstallet ska bli användbart året om som ett skaparcentrum med monumentalateljé för huvudsakligen glas och keramikkonst. Lokstallet har idag inget golv, vatten och avlopp, toalett eller liknande. Allt detta grundläggande och därtill en kurslokal, förvaringsutrymme, pentry, handikapptoalett med dusch, entresolplan och resursbibliotek och övernattningslya/kurslokal i tornet finns inritat här.
Här kan du kika på ombyggnadsförslaget som vi tagit fram tillsammans:

Del av de framtagna arkitektskisserna för ombyggnationen av lokstallet
Ombyggnationen är kostnadsberäknad till lite drygt tre miljoner kronor. Därtill tillkommer bland annat kostnader för stensättning framför fastigheten, investeringar i miljöteknik och viss markberedning med mera i skulpturparken.

Bufferthålen i mellanväggen och andra historiska detaljer i lokstallet sparas i ombyggnationen (Se filmen för att få höra Torsten Nilsson, 94, berätta hur bufferthålen kom till...!)
 
Kostnader som insamlingen gäller
Här följer en lista med kostnader för olika delar av lokstallets upprustning och omdaning, men innan du kikar på den vill jag göra ett förtydligande angående denna insamlingskampanj:
Varenda krona som kan samlas in här och nu behövs - i första hand till att täcka själva avstyckningen och övriga kostnader under punkt ett ovan.
Jag är inte så naiv att jag räknar med att Hammerdarlingarna och andra utsocknes vänner och lokstallsfantaster kommer att kunna/vilja täcka hela det ekonomiska behovet för lokstallet - här finns fler idéer kring var det skulle kunna finnas ekonomiska medel till genomförandet.
SKULLE det däremot ramla in större summor kommer dessa att direkt täcka renovering i den ordning som det är akut. Konstigare saker har hänt förut - och den stora drömmen vore att taket kunde byggas om bums och fönstren lagas så att inte vädret fortsätter att tära på huset.
Ju längre den här insamlingen når, desto närmare är Hammerdal ett räddat lokstall som innehåller konstnärlig öppen aktivitet, en öppen skulpturpark och ett minifik.

Torndelen med gamla vattencisternen till höger blir gästkonstnärsboende och resursbibliotek
 
KOSTNADER - i detalj:
(Några siffror utelämnade - det går naturligtvis att få veta mer!)
TAKET PÅ LÅNGSKEPPET och TAKET PÅ TORNET skulle ha behövt bytas senast för ett par år sedan och det är osäkert vilken vinter de kommer att ramla in. Att byta tak är absolut prioritet ett. Jag skulle skatta min lyckliga stjärna om det redan nu kom in tillräckligt mycket pengar så detta kunde genomföras under vintern/tidig vår.  Prel kostnad:  610 000 kr. (I den summan ingår allt arbete inklusive plåt- och skorstenslagningar, material, byggställning.)
FÖNSTER och DÖRRAR som inte vinden blåser rakt igenom och som fungerar att öppna och stänga, skulle jag skatta som absolut prio nr 2. Prel kostnad: 140 000 kr.
REKONSTRUKTION av PORTEN som nu är helt skranglig och står och slår med trasiga rutor. Prel kostnad: 100 000 kr. 
MURNING och LAGNING av krön, stenar, puts av innerväggar. Prel kostnad: 227 000 kr.
GOLV, VATTEN och AVLOPP (bland annat så de som arbetar i lokstallet ska kunna gå på toa!) känns som tredje prioritet. Fortfarande på rätt akut nivå för att överhuvud taget kunna använda lokstallet och hålla öppet. Prel kostnad:  660 000 kr.
VARMBONAD KURSLOKAL plus PENTRY där lera och kursdeltagare inte fryser hamnar bortåt nummer fyra. Prel kostnad: 380 000 kr.
ENTRESOLPLAN med lagringsutrymme och passage upp till övre tornrummet. Prel kostnad: 400 000 kr.
BJÄLKLAG i tornrummets nya golv. Prel kostnad: 38 000 kr.
SKYLTNING och INFORMATION utförd av Jamtli mm. Prel kostnad: 19 500 kr.
KAFFEMASKIN och MINIKAFÉ i lokstallets entré skulle jag önska mig redan till nästa sommar - men det kan inte prioriteras så högt... tak och golv måste komma före kafferep. Men vänta bara, det kommer det också.  Ej kostnadssatt.
STENSÄTTNING och iläggning av två järnvägsspårsnuttar för att visa historiens vingslag framför entréportarna. Det kan bara hända om jag får ruskigt mycket pengar över eller om någon skulle få lust att skänka några ton med smågatsten och räls. Man vet ju aldrig! Ej kostnadssatt.
 

'Det är bråttom nu, om det inte ska gå alltför illa med byggnaden!'  Björn Olofsson, Jamtli
 
PERK betyder lockbete och tackgåva i ett ord 

Ett crowdfundingprojekt går ut på att de som backar upp insamlingen ekonomiskt också får någon sorts så kallad 'PERK' - en tackpresent. För att undvika att pengarna jag samlar in blir skattepliktiga får dessa bara vara av mindre värde jämfört med summan som betalas in. De får heller inte vara av en karaktär som jag i övrigt skulle kunna sälja i min verksamhet, allt enligt Skatteverkets regler.
Jag har satt ihop en rad olika belöningar som du kan välja på för olika sponsringsbelopp. Tanken är att det ska kännas som en gott-och-blandat-påse med godsaker. Mycket att välja på; vilken är din favorit? Kanske vill du ha två eller flera godsaker?
 
Även små stöd är viktiga - allt räknas dubbelt:
Du behöver inte känna dig dålig om du så bara skulle backa upp projektet med en krona eller en tia om det är vad du kan ge. Det finns en stor poäng i om du ändå vill göra det!
Det är nämligen så att den här insamlingen också kommer att visa på ANTALET PERSONER som deltar och backar upp projektet. Då syns det att det här är en jätteviktig satsning som si eller så många faktiskt vill se hända och jag har 'på fötter' när jag ska söka medel från andra håll. Tänk om det gick att visa att exempelvis 70% av alla som bor i Hammerdal/Jämtland (och bortom) vill att detta ska bli av. Eller att si och så många yrkesverksamma längtar efter att få komma till lokstallet på kurs när det är färdigt...

Framtiden med LOKSTALLET FIRE & HEART


Parallellt med det här första försöket att hitta ekonomi för ombyggnationen av lokstallet söks medel för en förstudie och ett första verksamhetsprojekt kallat 'LOKSTALLET FIRE & HEART - heta tekniker, heta möten'. Tanken är att kunna starta upp driften i ett spännande verksamhetsprojekt direkt när själva byggnaden står renoverad och klar. 


'Tänk att kunna få komma och bygga stort och hyra in sig på en spännande maskinpark!'
 
Utmaningar, kritik och tänkbara svar
Som alla förstår finns det saker som kan sätta käppar i hjulet för den här typen av satsning. Det mest uppenbara är naturligtvis att jag inte hittar de summor som krävs för att få igång den upprustning och verksamhet som är planerad. Men här har jag långt kvar till vägs ände - tvärtom har jag ju bara börjat.
Någon kanske tänker:
- Varför ska vi backa upp henne, hon är ju bara en av alla oss företagare i byn, varför ska vi vara med och betala just hennes satsning? Frågan är relevant och korrekt. Men det finns skäl:
Jag har drivit frågan om att något ska hända med lokstallet i drygt tre års tid och lagt otaliga obetalda timmar på att komma till den punkt när jag tar över fastigheten. Jag har spottat in mer pengar än jag tänker berätta i sammanhanget utan att kunna tjäna en enda krona på det. Bland annat för att jag inte vill bo i en by som inte gör något åt ett förfallande lokstall. Så här kan vi ju inte ha det!
Det finns mängder av andra personer i Hammerdal som har haft planer för lokstallet som aldrig blev av. Av någon fantastisk anledning har jag blivit betrodd med att ta över fastigheten. Det är nu eller aldrig det händer. Nu finns chansen att hjälpa till om man på riktigt tycker att det skulle vara viktigt för byn att vårt vackraste hus tas om hand.
Slutligen kan man ju tycka att det är oskäligt att ekonomiskt backa upp en enskild individs blivande ateljé. Siktet är visserligen inställt på en ateljé jag också kommer att förlägga mitt privata skapande - men överlag som min vision ser ut kommer det att i allra högsta grad sprida ekonomiska fördelar och även en del pur glädje till byn. 
En poäng till finns att göra. Min vision för lokstallet kommer nog alltid att ge mer tillbaka till byn och andra besökare än vad jag kommer att plocka ut i reda pengar. Inte den mest lukrativa planen ekonomiskt kanske, men förhoppningsvis en av de mer byabefrämjande planerna för lokstallet?!


'Det här kommer att bli en satsning som blir viktig både internationellt, nationellt och lokalt.'
 
Det finns OLIKA sätt att hjälpa till! 
Som yrkesverksam konstnär har jag full förståelse för att alla människor inte har råd att stödja lokstallsprojektet med ekonomiska medel. Men det finns ett antal andra saker du gärna får hjälpa till med istället:

Ett hett tips är att sprida ordet om att detta crowdfundingprojekt/denna insamling nu är påbörjad! Berätta gärna muntligt till släkt och vänner om projektet. En annan bra sak är om du har möjlighet att sprida informationen digitalt. Det gör du lättast genom att gilla och dela inlägg på Facebook/Twitter/Instagram osv. Ju fler som vet om insamlingen och dess mål och syfte/framtidsvision desto fler kan tänkas vilja bidra.
Kampanjen pågår bara några veckor så det är viktigt att informationen sprids SNABBT.
Sitter du på smågatsten/annan marksten eller ett par snuttar av riktig järnvägsräls som du vill skänka så tar jag tacksamt emot dem! Det gör inget om jag får sten i olika former och storlekar bara det är just sten. Mosaik är inte ett problem utan en konstnärlig möjlighet!

'Vi kommer att stötta det här - självklart ska vi göra det!' -Anders Pålsson, Fyrås Trä AB VARMT TACK till alla som läst hit ner - nu hoppas jag att du kommer på hur mycket du vill och kan bidra. Kika under menyn/rubriken 'perks' så ser du vad du får för tack för olika stöd. Jag har som sagt försökt hitta på något för alla, lite som en riktigt bra godisblandning och det kan även tillkomma fler PERKS under insamlingens gång!Jag hoppas att du hittar minst en smaskig godbit! (Eller flera.)-Hjärtligt tack för ditt stöd! /Åsa Maria Hedberg. For my English speaking friends;Help me to save the old train car house in Hammerdal to make an international art centre!Hey! My name is Åsa Maria Hedberg and I'm delighted to see you here! Here's all the information about the campain for those interested in background information and future vision.NB: The film is now subtitled and if You click each perk - most of them are translated! Any questions: just click Ask a question - and I will come running to help!Welcome!New train car house owner - Åsa Maria Hedberg - who needs some economical start-up help BackgroundI am a full time working artist-ceramicist-glass artist with my own business in Hammerdal, a tiny village in northern Sweden. We moved here in 2013 from Östersund, a small town upnorth in Sweden, but I grew up at the Swedish east coast. I have been living at many places, among them in Pietermaritzburg in SA and in Sunderland, UK, as I studied for my BA of Fine Arts.Now I have the great honor and and pleasure to take over the old train car house in Hammerdal!I am passionately fond of this train car house and ever since I first saw the property, I have worked hard to save and to make use of the building for the future, for the villagers, to the delight of tourists and to make it into an art centre!As the train car house is such a locally heartfelt project I first and foremost made this a project written in Swedish even though using an American site; Indiegogo. But now I realise I might just as well have some fans 'out there' that could be interested in supporting me and the cause. My vision is to make this into an international art scene, with the main focus on green tech in making art from clay and glass. Also to enable large scale works. So please join me for the explanaition of my vision - and bare with me if my language sometimes failes... my mother tongue is Swedish. ;) Vision:Lokstallet FIRE & HEART- Hot techniques, cordial meetingsLokstallet FIRE & HEART is all about hot technologies and cordial meetings between peopleAn international and local art create centers where the main materials are clay and glass.The volume and space in the old train car house will enable art making in the larger scale using an overhead crane for moving around the sculptures and materials. A planned walkway at the bottom edge of the ceiling will simplify the creation of larger works.  A course room as a house-in-the-house in the further endShort courses for full-time artists on BA and MAlevels and also for hobbyists...creates opportunities for both beginners courses in ceramics and glass, but intentions are also to collaborate with colleges and universities in Sweden and internationally. The vision is to give short courses at bachelor and master level located in the train car house.There has already been some interest from future partner schools to locate some courses to the train car house, when up and runAll courses and workshops held at LOKSTALLET will be broadcast live and many courses will be given as distancy studies should You not be able to come in person. This will connect makers and places. Probably, many makers-students will try their best to be in Hammerdal for the next course, perhaps applying for an artist-in-residence period. Sustainability and environmental concerns in focus from the startThe project of 'LOKSTALLET fire and heART' will start off as a green project from scratch. This will be a unique venture where everything from rebuilding of the house it self to the art making projects will be completely permeated by environmental considerations. Today there is no ceramic/glass art center that focuses entirely on the environmental aspect of creation.The sculpture park will also enhance the quality of life and the environment for all who live in Hammerdal and for temporary guests. Various ornamental trees will be planted and fruit and berries shall be for everyone to pick and enjoy. A soil analysis is made to ensure that the land is not soiled by the previous operations. There were no remarks. Artist in Residence/mini meetings/studioThe tower portion will hold a mini kitchenette and a handicap WC with shower downstairs. At the top floor of the tower a small nook that will house a resource and material library around the four walls with comprehensive facts about ceramic and glass art in architecture and landscape.This room will also be used as a mini studio. The plan is to furnish so that a guest lecturer/artist in residence will be able to stay for shorter periods.Hammerdals' most beautiful building, tower part in sun set Mini caféteria - sales counter - and a sneak peak into art makingEntering the main doors a guest will first see a sales counter and a mini cafeteria; basically a coffee machine and some sandwiches/snacks. An employee host-kiln technician/caretaker will meet up. If you choose to remain inside the train car house You will often be able to see some hot forming of glass or monumental sculpture in clay or other materials. Another day, large-format drawing is at hand. There will always be something new happening on the basis of which artists are in the house!Being the owner of the train car house I (Åsa Maria Hedberg) will be the artist most often at the site, but the idea of being able to open up to other artists to come and work in periods feels great.A mini café is planned for the entrance of LOKSTALLET International sculpture park with a focus on large scale works in glass and ceramicsShould You buy a cup of coffee and go out in the park surrounding the train car house You will find many nice places to sit down and enjoy the moment. The idea is to mount a new large scale sculpture every other year as a new addition to the park. Glass and ceramics will take turns: first a magically special glass sculpture, then a cool ceramic piece by an internationally recognized artist and so on. This is a core topic for me; ceramics and glass art in public sites are not very common in Swedish cityscapes and not in rural areas either and to some extent not so commen even indoors. Often, buyers are wrongly troubled that ceramics and glass will shatter or crack - perhaps lacking knowledge that ceramics and glass do work even for cold climate. I would like to change that! What do Hammerdal back through the engine shed FIRE & HEART?My hope is that an open art center in the heart of the village of Hammerdal will create positive values ​​in many stages. The wish is that everyone shall feel welcome, that this will be a meeting point where villagers can stop by for a cup of coffee - a fika as we say in Sweden - and for travelers/tourists to stop for rest and inspiration.The basis in having a set opening hours and a 24/7 open sculpture park I believe will create a feeling that the old train car house is lifted from being a scruffy backyard where anyone can smash windows and break in for fun - into a pride for all of us.The 'secret' plan is to hopefully open by autumn 2018 ...!Side of the old train car house and part of the sculpture park to be What money is needed - and what you get in return:The project to get the train car house rescued, refurbished and mildly rebuilt for it's new use can be seen in three stages:1. SUPER ACUTE COSTS: Subdivision expenses, land registration, information material and signage/outdoor lighting/clearing of undergrowth in the park/robot mower2. ACUTE AND ACUTE LESS REFURBISHING; both exterior and interior. Here is a mending the roofs, renovation of windows/doors/bricks the most immediate priority. This will need to be fixed a s a p, preferably before or during winter 2016-17.3. NON emergency expenses - but needed for the complete vision: new technology for greener making of ceramic and glass art, fundings for the first large-scale sculpture to be set in the park and coffee machineTo be able to get anywhere with this project the train car house will need to be subdivided from the apartment houses today belonging to the same property. The Swedish Land Survey Authority has mentioned a vague figure of around 55,000 SEK for this - 6348 US$, a sum I do not have today. As this is a once in a life time possibility when the apartments are sold, I feel I need to grab the opportunity. But the roof on the north nave and tower portion is in a really bad condition, this is the last chance to save the building...The process of subdivision of the estate has just begun. I also now hold a signed contract of the purchase of the property, As soon as economical means are at hand I will start the refurbishing.In the autumn of 2015, I received a 90% economical support from the County Administrative Board of Jämtland - Culture department for an investigation of the conditions of the train car house. This was implemented by a specialist on old industrial buildings. Here you will find a link to the document which in detail describes the conditions of the train shed. It also holds proposals for careful restoration/renewal of the building based on the new proposed use:http: ... //media.asamariahedberg.se/2016/03/%C3%85t(Only in Swedish.)Jamtli at site late fall/winter of 2015 to go through the condition of the train car houseKjell Gisterå, architect at GisteråSjöstrand, was included in the process. He has drawn a plan that suggests mild changes to the interior to allow for large scale sculpturing and art making in mainly ceramics and glass. The train car house currently has no floor, no water and sewer, no toilet... All these basics, plus a course room, a storage room, a kitchenette, a toilet with space for wheelchairs, a shower, a mezzanine and resource library/nook for guest artists in the tower are plotted here.You can look at the proposal for the refurbishing here:LINKS TO ARCHITECTURAL DRAWINGS PDF:http: ... //media.asamariahedberg.se/2016/09/Skiss-phttp: ... //media.asamariahedberg.se/2016/09/Skiss-phttp: ... //media.asamariahedberg.se/2016/09/Skiss-pPart of the architectural plans for the remake of the train car houseThe reconstruction is estimated to cost just over three million SEK -  roundly half a million US$. Additional to this will be the paving in front of the entrance, investments in sustainably sound production technology and some scarification and more in the sculpture park area.Buffer holes in the wall and other historical details in the train car house will be saved in the gentle refurbishing. (See the film for the buffer hole story from 94 year old Torsten Nilsson!)
Costs to coverHere is a list of costs for different parts of the LOKSTALLET renovation and remodeling, but before you have a look at the detailed list, I would like to make a clarification about this fundraising campaign:Every penny that can be collected here and now is deeply needed - primarily to cover the subdivision and other costs under paragraph one above.I am not so naive as to expect that the village people of Hammerdal and other nonresidential friends and train car house fans will be able or want to cover all the financial needs - I have many more ideas about where to look for financial resources for the implementation.Should the campain render larger sums - inshallah -, these will directly cover the renovation in the order of urgency. Stranger things have happened before - and the big dream would be that the roof could be mended ASAP and windows repaired so that the weather would stop eroding the house.The better the result of this campain, the closer Hammerdal would be to a saved train car house that opens up for the world to come and work in the open work shop, an open sculpture park with international artists and a mini caféteria.Tower part with old water tank on the right will be nook for guest artists and a resource library
COSTS - in detail:(Some figures omitted - ask if You need more detailed information!)THE ROOF OF THE NORTH SIDE OF THE NAVE and THE ROOF OF THE TOWER should have been refurbished at the very latest a couple of years ago and as such they can fall in any winter with heavy snow. Replacing the roofs is of absolute necessity. I would praise my lucky star if this campain would render enough money so this could be carried out during this winter or early spring 2017. Prel cost: 610 000 SEK. (This amount includes all roof top work including sheet metal and chimney repairs, materials, construction site ladders and more.)WINDOWS and DOORS that is not just holes for the wind to blow right through and which actually functions as in opening and closing. I would deem this to be the absolute priority No. 2. Prel cost: 140 000 SEK.RECONSTRUCTION OF THE FRONT DOOR that is now completely rickety with broken glass windows. Prel cost: SEK 100 000.MASONRY and REPAIRING of crest, bricks, plastering of interior walls. Prel cost: 227 000 SEK.CONCRETE FLOOR, RUNNING WATER and SEWAGE so that people working in the train car house will be able to go to the bathroom! Feels as third priority. Still right on the emergency level to at all be able to use the train car house for art making and to be open to the public. Prel cost: 660 000 SEK.A HOUSE-IN-THE-HOUSE COURSE ROOM plus KITCHENETTE where neither the clay humans freeze comes as priority No 4. Prel cost: 380 000 SEK.MEZZANINE with storage space and access to the upper tower room. Prel cost: 400 000.JOISTS in the new flooring of the tower room. Prel cost: 38 000.SIGNAGE and INFORMATION MATERIAL designed by Jamtli. Prel cost 19 500 SEK.COFFEE MACHINE/MINI CAFÉTERIA in the entrance of the train car house. I wish this already for next summer - but it cannot be prioritized... mending roofs and installing floors must come before coffee/tea and 'fika'. But just wait, a mini cafeteria will be there in time.PAVING including two railway track snippets to show the train car history in front of the entrance gates. This can only happen if I get loads of money OR if anyone would like to donate a few tons of small cobblestones and a couple of rail snippets... You never know! 'Refurbishing need to happen NOW, unless...!' Björn Olofsson, architectural consultant of Jamtli PERK means 'bait' and 'thank you gift' in one wordThe set up of a crowdfunding project means that people backing the cause also get some sort of 'PERK' - a thank you gift. To avoid the money I collect will be taxable, these can only be of less value than the amount actually given. Also, the perks may not be of a character that I otherwise could sell in my business, according to the Swedish Tax Agency's rules.I have put together a variety of rewards that you can choose from. The idea is that it should feel like a bag of sweets. Plenty to choose from; which is your favorite? Maybe you want to have two or more of the sweets? ALL support is important - everything will count twice:There is no need to feel bad if you want to back the project with a penny or a dollar if that's what you can give. There is a great point if you still want to do it!The fact is that this collection will also show the number of people involved that supports the idea. This will tell something about the initiative, that many people really want to see this future vision come true. I can refer to the number of participants when applying for other economical support. It would be terrific if I could say, 70% of all people living in Hammerdal Sweden - and beyond! - wants this to happen. Or that so and so many professionals yearn to get to the train depot to work or study at one of the courses when it is all set...Beautiful roasted chimney from the time of steam engine trains The future project 'LOKSTALLET fire & heART'Parallell to this crowdfunding campain trying to find finances for the refurbishing of the old train car house I also apply for funds for a feasibility study and an initial business project called 'Lokstallet FIRE & HEART - hot techniques, cordial meetings'. The idea is to be able to start up the work shop directly when the building is renovated and purposely rebuilt.'Imagine being able to work and build large and to rent top quality machinery!' CHALLANGES, CRITISISM and some potential ANSWERSAs everyone knows, there are things that can puta brake to a venture of this type. The most obvious of course, is that I do not find the sums required to start the refurbishments and activities as planned. But I have a long way to the end of the road - on the contrary, I have the only just begun this journey.Someone may think:- Why should we back her, she's just one of all small scale business owners in the village, why should we help her idea to come true? The question is relevant and accurate. Here are some reasons:I have pushed for something to happen with the old train car house in just over three years now working countless unpaid hours to get to the point when I now will take over the ownershop of the property. I've already used more money than I will tell you here, without being able to earn a single cent from it. One of the reasons I did that is because I do not want to live in a village that doesn't maintain such a beautiful building as our train car house. Something must be done!There are many people in Hammerdal who had plans for the train car house that never got around to it. For some amazing reason, I was entrusted to take over the property. It's now or never this will happen. Now is the chance to help out if You really think it would be important for the village and world that this marvellous building can be the proposed open art centre/cafeteria we all need.Finally, one might think that it is unfair to financially back up an individual's future studio. The intention is for me to use this house as my own private studio - but my vision for the train car house will most certainly be of economical value to the whole village and also render some sheer joy of art to us all.My vision for the train car house will probably always give more back to the village and other visitors than I will be able to earn economically. Perhaps not the most lucrative plan, but hopefully one of the more village enhancing ones when refurbishing the train car house?!'This will be an investment that will be important both internationally, nationally and locally.' There are DIFFERENT ways to help!As a professional artist, I fully understand that all people can not afford to support the train car house project financially. But there are a number of other things you are welcome to help with instead:
A hot tip is to spread the word about this crowdfunding project! Please tell your friends and family about the project. Another good thing is if you have the opportunity to spread the information digitally. The easy way to do that is by liking and sharing posts on Facebook/ Twitter/Instagram etc. The more people who know about the collection and future vision, the more likely will help.
The campaign will run only a few weeks so it is important that the information spread quickly.
Should You have small paving cobblestones and/or rail road metal snippets and want to donate them I'll gratefully accept! It does not matter if I get street stones in various measurements. Mosaic is not a problem, rather an artistic opportunity!
'We will support this - of course we'll do that!' -Anders Palsson, Fyrås Wood ABMANY THANKS to all who read down here - now I hope that You will consider how and much You can and want to contribute. Peek under the menu 'perks' and you'll see what You can get for various sums. I have tryed to make up something for everyone, a bit like a really good candy mix and I might also add perks as the campain continues!I hope that you will find at least one yummy 'treat'=perk!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I LOVE making pots. It is a passion and an all engulfing obsession, and I’m quite good at it, having made pots over the last decade. I know a lot about throwing, glazing, handbuilding and all the things it takes to make a pottery. I first got involved with clay in 2005, originally handbuilding. I then apprenticed in a hand throwing workshop after this,and have been making ever since. Over the last few years I have continued my work with handthrown pottery and teaching handbuilt pottery, while developing several signature pieces and glazes.<br/><br/>After a decade of working voluntarily for a charity I had a serious crisis of health, and I found myself penniless, without any major qualifications, and without the capacity to work. But what I did have was a trade. I had a decade of practical experience making pottery and that's what I am setting out to do. On my difficult days having something pragmatic gives me the chance to put one foot in front of the other and do something constructive. For now it is to be a productive hobby as I get back to my feet and get active after a year of languishing, but with time I would like to grow towards professional production, sales, and chiseling out a living from what I do well.<br/><br/><strong>So Why a Crowdfund?</strong></p>
<p>I am living hand-to-mouth at the moment, living on less than €800 a month. I am limited in my capacity to work due to a preexisting disability and ongoing chronic health issues and my income and cost of living makes 'just saving' pretty much impossible. This work is something I can do, that I have a decade of successful experience with,  and because it is flexible, it can accommodate my health issues in a positive and affirming way.<br/><br/>I need to make a change. I really need a cash injection to hit the ground running. It's not a pie-in-the-sky dream - this will happen, one way or another, but it would be a lot easier and more immediate with a little help. A lot of people want something for nothing, but that is not what I am looking for. A crowdfund is a way for mutual return, where you positively contribute to my work, and I can offer the fruits of my labour in return. </p>
<p>Your help means that I can do something useful again, regain some of the dignity that long-term illness takes away, and long-term work towards coming off illness related benefits.</p>

<h3>What I Need</h3>

This is not by any stretch of the imagination all of the costs involved, with shelving, batts, tools, materials, a wheel, postage and more, but this would go a long way towards a good start. Besides, I don't want you to pay for everything as I'm balancing asking for help with self-reliance and working towards the dignity and character that comes from clambering to achieve something. I am trying to ask for help to cover the difficult to achieve costs through a crowdfund, but I am also continuing to spend money on all the OTHER costs (because again, not a handout but a leg up).</p>

This Campaign will allow me to travel to the Healing Hill Art Space, Badisher, MorniHills and Chandigarh, in India, from October 29th to November 24th, 2018. Here I have been invited to show a new work and participate in the festival as an observer and an artist in residence.
I have limitations on my capacity to work. This makes it harder and harder to gather funds for opportunities like this. Reaching out and asking for help is now a big part of the transformation of my practice. This opportunity is only possible with your help and I would be deeply grateful for any contribution whatsoever. 
 

What I Need & What You Get.
This funding will cover my travel expenses to and from India as well as allowing me to stay and contribute in a comfortable position. For every donation I am willing to offer my services in many ways.

In addition, I have worked and studied with Fernando Sandoval, Abraham Torres, The Multimedia Center of the National Center of Arts of Mexico, Panoptico Atelier, DiezyMedia Collective, Edwin Salas and Fernando Bellver, among others, learning etching, marionette carving, photogravure, albumen and carbon printing, stenopeic film, stop motion animation, generative code, and digital art.

These deeply felt works combine magical realism, the human figure, and anthropomorphic still lifes to produce eerie visual narratives on the labyrinth of the psyche and the human condition. The paintings address our contemporary spiral into global chaos and confusion, as well as human yearning for the quietude of nature and antiquity. I use dolls, masks, and other objects and draw from myth, archetype and religion, in a dark yet playful, childlike manner.

Desde 2010, he impartido talleres en México, España y Portugal sobre grabado, mecanismos de marionetas, pintura y la aplicación de tintes naturales en serigrafía y arte gráfico.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Sobre mi campaña</strong></p><p>En noviembre de 2018, comencé una nueva serie de retratos al óleo que ahora quiero compartir con el mundo. Estas obras profundamente emotivas combinan el realismo mágico, la figura humana y las naturalezas muertas antropomórficas para producir narraciones visuales espeluznantes sobre el laberinto de la psique y la condición humana. Las pinturas abordan nuestra espiral contemporánea en el caos global y la confusión, así como el anhelo humano por la tranquilidad de la naturaleza y la antigüedad. Utilizo muñecas, máscaras y otros objetos, y me inspiro en los mitos, arquetipos y religiones, de una manera oscura pero juguetona. La serie se titula: ¨ El Descenso de los Querubines "".</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563927651/y3ef6xqgencji1nu3ccz.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A principios de este año, tomé medidas para compartir este trabajo fuera de México, participando activamente en plataformas de redes sociales, contactando al público y otros artistas, y recientemente fui uno de los 100 artistas seleccionados de todo el mundo para mostrar su trabajo en The Other Art Fair (TOAF), este septiembre, 2019 en Los Ángeles, California.

Actualmente, divido mi tiempo entre Oaxaca, Ciudad de México y Xalapa, donde se encuentra mi estudio principal, en medio de un hermoso bosque de niebla. He recibido capacitación profesional en pintura al óleo clásica, al fresco y con el uso de tintes naturales, con artistas como Shane Wolf, Kate Stone, Jesús González Gutiérrez y Maddalena Forcella; en México, Europa, los Estados Unidos y Canadá. Además, he trabajado y estudiado con Fernando Sandoval, Abraham Torres, Taller Panóptico, el Centro Multimedia del CNA de México, el Colectivo DiezyMedia, Edwin Salas y Fernando Bellver, entre otros, en el área de grabado, tallado de marionetas, fotograbado, albúmina e impresión al carbón, cine estenopeico, animación stop motion, código generativo y arte digital. Desde 2010, he impartido talleres en México, España y Portugal sobre grabado, mecanismos de marionetas, pintura y la aplicación de tintes naturales en serigrafía y arte gráfico. Sobre mi campañaEn noviembre de 2018, comencé una nueva serie de retratos al óleo que ahora quiero compartir con el mundo. Estas obras profundamente emotivas combinan el realismo mágico, la figura humana y las naturalezas muertas antropomórficas para producir narraciones visuales espeluznantes sobre el laberinto de la psique y la condición humana. Las pinturas abordan nuestra espiral contemporánea en el caos global y la confusión, así como el anhelo humano por la tranquilidad de la naturaleza y la antigüedad. Utilizo muñecas, máscaras y otros objetos, y me inspiro en los mitos, arquetipos y religiones, de una manera oscura pero juguetona. La serie se titula: ¨ El Descenso de los Querubines "".  A principios de este año, tomé medidas para compartir este trabajo fuera de México, participando activamente en plataformas de redes sociales, contactando al público y otros artistas, y recientemente fui uno de los 100 artistas seleccionados de todo el mundo para mostrar su trabajo en The Other Art Fair (TOAF), este septiembre, 2019 en Los Ángeles, California. En los últimos ocho años, TOAF, organizada por Saatchi Art, ha liderado el camino para descubrir y fomentar nuevos talentos creativos, permitiendo a los artistas forjar relaciones directas con potenciales compradores y galeristas. En este momento me estoy enfocando en pintar ""El Descenso de los Querubines"" mientras preparo este esfuerzo para recaudar la cantidad sustancial de dinero que necesito para pagar el stand en el TOAF, y los gastos relacionados, como mi vuelo a Los Ángeles. Si logro recaudar más que la meta citada abajo, reinvertiré los fondos que queden en materiales de arte y producción para el trabajo que planeo mostrar en Entijuanarte (Tijuana, México), otra importante feria de arte para la que fui aceptada, actualmente programada para octubre de 2019. Si No alcanzo mi objetivo, haré uso de mi ingenio y del dinero que consiga recaudar para asistir a TOAF con mi mejor trabajo nuevo.Finalmente, quiero agradecer a los amigos y familiares que han ayudado con esta campaña, haciendo el video, documentando mi trabajo y dando consejos. Creo que cuando una comunidad hace un esfuerzo para ayudar a una persona a alcanzar una meta, es realmente importante mostrar gratitud y practicar la reciprocidad, así como compartir los efectos positivos de la ayuda brindada. Por lo tanto, sea cual sea el monto de su contribución, recibirá una nota de agradecimiento personal y actualizaciones exclusivas sobre mi nuevo trabajo y el progreso realizado en la campaña.  ESPERO QUE PUEDAS CONTRIBUIR A MI CAMPAÑA PARA RECAUDAR LOS FONDOS QUE NECESITO!  Gastos que necesito cubrir-Materiales de arte para terminar la serie (papel de algodón de alta calidad, tela, bastidores, gesso, pinceles, solventes y pintura al óleo): $ 500 USD-Un stand en la feria TOAF que mide 1.5 m2 con iluminación superior = $ 1,680 + impuesto de ventas = $ 1,818.60 USDBoleto de avión de ida y vuelta Ciudad de México - Los Ángeles: $ 450 USD (este es un costo aproximado)-Enmarcado e instalación de obra para la feria: $ 550 USD.- Cuota por Transacción Internacional Bancaria: $25  Total = $ 3,344 USD RegalosAquí hay una lista de los regalos que ofreceré a cambio de su apoyo.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What is a Merkaba?</strong></p>
<p>The Merkaba transcends history and culture. This symbol is found in many sacred text and its meaning interpreted in many ways. In Jewish teachings the Merkaba represents Ezekiel's Chariot, used to ascend to the Throne of God. It has also been said that the Egyptian god, Ra, used the Merkaba to travel between our plane of existence and those of higher consciousness. In my personal exploration, the Merkaba has transported my spirit to states of Enlightenment. There is a deep connection between the Chakras and the Balance of our personal Merkabas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What is the Merkaba Inner SpaceShip?</strong></p>
<p>M.I.S.S. is an interactive physical representation of the Merkaba. Each point on the star-tetrahedron (Merkaba shape) will represent one of the 7 major Chakras. The panels will have symbols &amp; sacred geometry cut into every side. Each of the points will shine one of seven distinct colors of light to match the color of that Chakra. You will be able to climb inside the Merkaba and have a transcending experience guided by sound. The highest point (Crown Chakra) will be adorned with infinity mirrors to expand awareness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Who is making this thing?</strong></p>
<p>The project is brought to you by the High Noon Village. The idea came about first as a concept for a Temple, however it has evolved and expanded into the interactive awesomeness that is about to become. My name is Bacon, and I'm the project lead. I've delivered on multiple art-grant funded and personally funded projects in the past including:</p>
<ul style=""margin-left:80px;"">
<li>""<i>The Freaky Deeky Time Machine Dance Floor</i>"" - push a button to select a time period, music plays, lights kick on, and people dance. (Flipside 2012)</li>
<li>""<i>NOMIS</i>"" - interactive game of pattern matching, known as Simon, played out with flame cannons and awesome sound effects. (Myschievia 2013)</li>
<li>""<i>The Fire COSM</i>"" - 4 person interactive DJ station, press buttons, twist knobs, and slide sliders, to collaborate, create, and effect music, with tempo synced fire cannon, naturally. (Flipside 2014, Myschievia 2014)</li>
<li>""<i>Tripp's Pyramid of Cubes &amp; the Oblisk</i>"" - interactive projection mapped visuals on LED backed cubes. (Freezerburn 2015-16, Flipside 2016)</li>
<li>""<i>High Noon Saloon Doors"" - </i>The entry way to High Noon, these saloon style doors fire boosh cannons as you walk or kick your way through them! (Freezerburn 2016, Flipside 2016)</li>
</ul>
<p>I could not have completed any of these projects without the amazing village that is High Noon. We are assembled and ready to commence the build for our latest project, the Merkaba Inner SpaceShip! This time we are looking for some help from our community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Budget</strong></p>
<p>The planned budget for the project is around $1400. We are incredibly grateful, and thrilled to announce that we received funding through an art grant from Freezerburn for the amount of $599!!! Huge thanks to everyone who purchased an art grant ticket to FZB! This left us needing $800 to make it happen. I started the fundraising by adding in $50, and now I'm opening it up to the community through this Indiegogo campaign to raise $750.</p>
<p>The beauty of indiegogo is that even if we only raise $500 the money will still go to the project, so its ok if we don't meet the total goal. I will supply any additional funding needed to make this project happen in the event that we don't hit our community funding goal of $750. On the contrary, if we go over our goal all additional funds will go directly to High Noon and be reflected back to the community in the form of gifts at FZB.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<h3>Hello Family, Friends, and Potential Investors,</h3>
<p>My name is Julian Magloire.  I am from Brooklyn, NY, and I'm in the process of producing a photo book entitled ""Peace"".  ""Peace"" would be a collection of historical interpretations through photos.  It involves many different cultures, religions, and theories that are present today.  If I am able to reach my goal, I would continue developing a strategy for marketing the book to touch the hearts of my local community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to reach this goal, the estimated amount I would need to create this book efficiently would be $3000.  The money would be used to rent photography and videography equipment, purchase props, hire models, transportation expenses, and last but not least, print at least 10  books to start.  The equipment rental alone is around $950 for a week.  Now whatever is actually raised would alter some plans to make this done the best way possible, but any contribution would still help the project make a step to come alive.</p>
<ul>
<li>I know people some people love to design their homes with furniture, art, or many other items. As a perk, I would like to contribute to the beauty of your home or office space.  </li>
<li>If you donate $100 or more, I will email a list of abstract photographs that I have taken, and I will print it on a 16x16 canvas to contribute to the overall design of your home or office. In addition, there will be a video production that goes along with the photo-book on youtube. I will list your name as a sponsor for the project in the ending credits.</li>
<li> If $50 is contributed, I will email the same list of abstract photographs, and whichever photo you choose, I will print an 8x10 photo and place it in a beautiful frame. In addition, there will be a video production that goes along with the photo-book on youtube. I will list your name as a sponsor for the project in the ending credits.</li>
<li> If $25 is contributed, I will email the same list of abstract photographs, and whichever you choose, I will print a 4x6 photo and put it in a beautiful frame.  </li>
<li>If the contribution is up to $24, I will list your name as a sponsor for the project in the video production that goes along with the photo-book on youtube.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every contribution matters, even if it is a $1.  The purpose of this book is to inform readers of historical events, and also to open their minds to decipher my interpretations through doing their own research on the topics.</li>
<li>I have worked on a lot of successful projects with a production group called x|posure and was the Editor-in-Chief of my university's yearbook.  If you know me, you know I'm very passionate about my projects. If you don't, trust me and contribute to my project to see how this can potentially impact peoples lives.</li>

<h3>Echoing the words of resistance sprayed across the walls of the Arab Spring.</h3>
<p>In the spirit of Mizna’s literary mission and focus on Arab experience, this installation is meant to fuse for participants a tactile encounter with a foreign language, distant trials of political empowerment, and a universally popular art form.<strong> It’s a touch of what’s been happening in Arab countries on the street, beyond the news stories. </strong>As Occupy Wall Street and other local and national movements here have shown, the aspirations for freedom and political agency across the world are akin to our own. </p>

<h3>What is the <em>Underpass of the Eyes of Freedom?</em>
</h3>
<p>Mohamed Mahmoud Street borders Tahrir Square in Cairo, Egypt. It is also known as ""Street of the Eyes of Freedom"" in honor of those who were wounded during protests. Emblematic of other public spaces in revolutionary Arab countries, this street is a site of provocative and vibrant street art, rendering an ongoing dialogue of the emerging realities of democratization. This project title is in tribute to that extraordinary place, and is rooted in our Northern Spark site which is quite literally an underpass. <strong>With <em>Underpass of the Eyes of Freedom,</em> Mizna invites festival-goers to pay homage to this site of art-as-activism and engage in a simple, creative gesture of solidarity.</strong></p>

<p>Hello! My name is Sara, I’m half Italian and half Bajan, and ever since I was a child I have cultivated the passion for art in all its forms and expressions.</p>
<p>Over the years, my vicissitudes prevented me from continuously dedicating myself to this passion. Only lately I could breathe easy and finally take on painting. You can find some samples of my art on my website: <a href=""http://sarazanocchio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://sarazanocchio.com/"">www.sarazanocchio.com </a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, for a long time I have worked in close contact with the world of design and furniture, so I felt a growing need to express myself also through sculpture and art installations.</p>
<p>Then I decided to create the WonderWall, a wall sprinkled with coloured tits - ghostly drops yearning to amuse, surprise, obsess and keep you company! The art installation is composed by 15 handmade pieces, in 3 sizes and shapes of various colours. It’s called <strong>Will-o’-the-Tits</strong>!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Ciao a tutti! Mi chiamo Sara, sono metà italiana e metà Barbadiana, sin da bambina ho coltivato la passione per la pittura e l’arte in tutte le sue forme ed espressioni.</em></p>
<p><em>Le mie vicissitudini, negli anni, mi hanno impedito di applicarmi continuativamente a queste mie passioni. Solo recentemente ho potuto tirare un po’ il fiato e dedicarmi, finalmente, alla pittura.Potete trovare alcuni miei lavori direttamente sul mio sito: <a href=""http://sarazanocchio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://sarazanocchio.com/"">www.sarazanocchio.com</a></em></p>
<p><em>Lavorando per anni a contatto con il mondo dell’arredamento e del design ho sentito una crescente necessità di esprimermi anche attraverso la scultura e le installazioni.</em></p>
<p><em>Ho quindi deciso di creare il WonderWall, una parete costellata di seni colorati, gocce spettrali desiderose di tenervi compagnia, ossessionarvi, divertivi e stupirvi. L’installazione è composta da 15 pezzi fatti a mano uno ad uno, di 3 dimensioni e forme in vari colori, chiamate <strong>Will-o’-the-Tits!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Here below a sketch of the project:</p>
<p><em>Qui sotto una bozza del progetto:</em></p>
<div>
<p><img alt=""WonderWall"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i45.tinypic.com/ogi0cg.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""WonderWall""/></p>
<p>3 reasons why it’s so crucial to have your grant and support:</p>
<p><strong>- In order to fully realize my project, I need to cover the costs for all of the materials, essential tools and a photobook by a professional photographer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>- I wish to share the idea for my first art installation with as many people as possible, thanks to the Internet and Indiegogo.</strong></p>
<p><strong>- This project is original and funny! It allows to turn a wall in your house into a true WonderWall that’ll be the envy of all your friends! Have you ever desired to have an entire wall sprinkled with tits? I have indeed!!!</strong></p>
<p>Please help make come true such a small dream, but so important to me!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Per me è molto importante avere il vostro contributo e il vostro aiuto per 3 principali motivi:</em></p>
<p><em><strong>- attuare il progetto nella sua interezza, coprendo i costi dei materiali, degli strumenti indispensabili per la sua creazione e quelli richiesti per la realizzazione di un book fotografico con l’ausilio di un fotografo professionista.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>-condividere la mia idea e la mia prima installazione, grazie ad internet e Indiegogo, con più persone possibili.<br/></strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>- Il progetto è originale e divertente, poter rendere una parete di casa vostra un vero e proprio Muro delle Meraviglie farà l’invidia di tutti i vostri amici! Chi non ha mai desiderato un’intera parete costellata di tette? Io sì!!!</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Aiutatemi a realizzare questo piccolo sogno, ma per me importantissimo!</em></p>

<h3><strong><em>Process</em></strong></h3>
<p>All the pieces are first drawn and then shaped by hand, using a modeling paste composed by a base of wax. Then I create the mold pouring slowly silicone.</p>
<p>Once I obtained the mold I pour inside it a two-component silicone with microballs, that makes the final product light but resistant.</p>
<p>Then I sand the tit so I can take any imperfection away, I cover it by brushing it with a primer for three times that will permit the future color to stick and finally I paint it.</p>
<p>The last step, right after the coloring, consists of a hand of plasticizer which makes the piece of art long-lasting.</p>
<p>Voilà! A beautiful colored boob ready to be exhibited!</p>
<p>All the pieces are signed and numbered.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><em><strong>Procedimento</strong></em></h3>

Finally I can show you the first shoots of the Wonderwall!!!

27/05/2013 Hello everybody, I want to truly thank everybody who helped me and believed in me. For me your support has been very important. The project was a success. Now I will have to work a lot, it will be done with a big smile and a great awareness: I can and I want to continue to pursue the path of art.

Ciao a tutti,  Voglio sinceramente ringraziare tutti quelli che mi hanno aiutato e hanno creduto in me. Per me è stato davvero importante. Il progetto è stato un successo. Ora ci sarà tanto tanto da lavorare, verrà fatto con un grande sorriso e una grande consapevolezza: posso e voglio continuare a percorrere la strada dell'arte.
 
 
Hello! My name is Sara, I’m half Italian and half Bajan, and ever since I was a child I have cultivated the passion for art in all its forms and expressions.
Over the years, my vicissitudes prevented me from continuously dedicating myself to this passion. Only lately I could breathe easy and finally take on painting. You can find some samples of my art on my website: www.sarazanocchio.com 
Meanwhile, for a long time I have worked in close contact with the world of design and furniture, so I felt a growing need to express myself also through sculpture and art installations.
Then I decided to create the WonderWall, a wall sprinkled with coloured tits - ghostly drops yearning to amuse, surprise, obsess and keep you company! The art installation is composed by 15 handmade pieces, in 3 sizes and shapes of various colours. It’s called Will-o’-the-Tits!
 
Ciao a tutti! Mi chiamo Sara, sono metà italiana e metà Barbadiana, sin da bambina ho coltivato la passione per la pittura e l’arte in tutte le sue forme ed espressioni.
Le mie vicissitudini, negli anni, mi hanno impedito di applicarmi continuativamente a queste mie passioni. Solo recentemente ho potuto tirare un po’ il fiato e dedicarmi, finalmente, alla pittura.Potete trovare alcuni miei lavori direttamente sul mio sito: www.sarazanocchio.com
Lavorando per anni a contatto con il mondo dell’arredamento e del design ho sentito una crescente necessità di esprimermi anche attraverso la scultura e le installazioni.
Ho quindi deciso di creare il WonderWall, una parete costellata di seni colorati, gocce spettrali desiderose di tenervi compagnia, ossessionarvi, divertivi e stupirvi. L’installazione è composta da 15 pezzi fatti a mano uno ad uno, di 3 dimensioni e forme in vari colori, chiamate Will-o’-the-Tits!
 
Here below a sketch of the project:
Qui sotto una bozza del progetto:


3 reasons why it’s so crucial to have your grant and support:
- In order to fully realize my project, I need to cover the costs for all of the materials, essential tools and a photobook by a professional photographer.
- I wish to share the idea for my first art installation with as many people as possible, thanks to the Internet and Indiegogo.
- This project is original and funny! It allows to turn a wall in your house into a true WonderWall that’ll be the envy of all your friends! Have you ever desired to have an entire wall sprinkled with tits? I have indeed!!!
Please help make come true such a small dream, but so important to me!
 
Per me è molto importante avere il vostro contributo e il vostro aiuto per 3 principali motivi:
- attuare il progetto nella sua interezza, coprendo i costi dei materiali, degli strumenti indispensabili per la sua creazione e quelli richiesti per la realizzazione di un book fotografico con l’ausilio di un fotografo professionista.
-condividere la mia idea e la mia prima installazione, grazie ad internet e Indiegogo, con più persone possibili.
- Il progetto è originale e divertente, poter rendere una parete di casa vostra un vero e proprio Muro delle Meraviglie farà l’invidia di tutti i vostri amici! Chi non ha mai desiderato un’intera parete costellata di tette? Io sì!!!
Aiutatemi a realizzare questo piccolo sogno, ma per me importantissimo!
 
Sculpture Large Will-o'-the-Tit (the colour can change)
(15x28.5x8cm - 6x11x3 inches)
        
 
 
Sculpture Medium Will-o'-the-Tit (the colour can change) 
(11x20x6cm - 4.5x8x2.5 inches)       
 
  

 
 
Sculpture Small Will-o'-the-Tit (the colour can change)
(8x15x5cm - 3x6x2 inches)
                            
                     
Process
All the pieces are first drawn and then shaped by hand, using a modeling paste composed by a base of wax. Then I create the mold pouring slowly silicone.
Once I obtained the mold I pour inside it a two-component silicone with microballs, that makes the final product light but resistant.
Then I sand the tit so I can take any imperfection away, I cover it by brushing it with a primer for three times that will permit the future color to stick and finally I paint it.
The last step, right after the coloring, consists of a hand of plasticizer which makes the piece of art long-lasting.
Voilà! A beautiful colored boob ready to be exhibited!
All the pieces are signed and numbered.
 
Procedimento
Tutti i pezzi vengono prima disegnati e poi plasmati a mano, utilizzando una pasta modellabile a base di cera. Vengono poi creati degli stampi con colate di silicone.
Una volta ottenuti gli stampi viene versato al loro interno un bicomponente siliconico misto a microballs, che rendono il prodotto finale leggero ma resistente.
Poi il seno viene carteggiato e rifinito togliendo le imperfezioni, si da poi un fondo per tre volte che permette al futuro colore di aderire e, infine, viene colorato.
L’ultimo step, subito dopo la colorazione, prevede una passata di plastificante che rende il prodotto duraturo e resistente nel tempo.
E voilà, una bellissima tetta colorata tutta da mostrare!

<p><strong>YouthCanSlam <em>(YCS</em>)</strong> is a spoken word festival that will be held for the first time in <strong>Ottawa  </strong> this <strong>August of 2013.</strong>  Its focus is to fill a cultural void by providing a national stage for youth spoken word artists across Canada to demonstrate poetry at its finest in a five day celebration and competition of the Spoken Word Poetry art form. The Festival Organizing Committee consists of some of Canada's most dedicated and decorated artists. They pledge to bring to Ottawa an event that will not only be memorable, but one that will become a mainstay for the showcasing of Canada's talented youth. Contributions for this landmark event will not only help build a festival that will rival other spoken word festivals across Canada, mainly the Canadian Individual Poetry Slam and the Canadian Festival of Spoken Word, but also heighten awareness of one of the fastest growing art forms while heightening the appeal of the nation’s capital as not only a government city but as a city that is known for its thriving art community.</p>
<p><strong>We're in this together!</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>YCS</em></strong> has set our goal to $3500. This number is small for an art festival and you may be thinking, ""How can a five day festival run on such small funds?"" The reality is, given that we are in our first year, we are planning to start with a reasonable goal and not have to build a five day event around unrealistic expectations.  So we put our goals in arms reach, one that we believe can be accomplished; but not without your generosity! It is with your contribution that we will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book venues for daily poetry competitions and workshops</li>
<li>Book artists to facilitate workshops</li>
<li>Make down payments on renting sound equipment and lodging for travelling artists</li>
<li>Purchase awards, pay for sub-contracting professionals involved in the production process of the festival, and have additional monies to cover any emergency costs or necessary expenses such as purchasing of licenses, registration and administration fees and food and beverage costs for hired artists.</li>
</ul><p><strong>But that's not it!</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>YSC</em></strong> will give back to you! Your contributions will get you feeling the poetic rush as we offer you perks that you just can't say no to. From discounted event tickets, to poetry memorabilia, we have something for the art lover in everybody, and once our campaign is over; if we have not reached our goal we will be applying your generous contributions to manage our base costs for the festival such as venue booking and artist fees.</p>
<p><strong>Where do we go from here?</strong></p>
<p>We grow. Like any festival or event organized for the purpose of bridging communities through the arts, we desire to make this first time event one that puts the talent of our youth across Canada on the map.  For the last 12 years spoken word poetry has gained so much momentum that to not offer a platform for our youth would be a disservice to our national art community. While Spoken Word may unofficially be the fastest growing art form, it is officially the most underrated and underfunded. We hope that spotlighting young poets who are stepping up to claim their space in the rich art legacy that our country has to offer will create avenues that do not presently exist for spoken word poets to professionalize themselves as career artists.   </p>
<p><strong>It's not just about the funds!</strong></p>

Our IndieGoGo campaign: We're raising just $15,000 more to bring this installation to the location, build it with a team of volunteers, pay for municipal permits, fire safety and police protection, enable local artists to be involved with free supplies and materials, outreach to Las Vegas schoolchildren, bringing busloads to the Cube and satellite Cubes out to their schools, host area musicians performing at the Cube, print wish sticks and our photo archive display, design and set up brilliant night-time lighting and create an awesome final Burn ceremony on March 21st.  
Your donation, combined with hundreds of others, will enable us to reach our goal and fund it all!  
Every donor gets a wish! There is other stuff you get (see rewards!) -- but most of all, whether small or large,  you will know that your donation really does support this art project and its message.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Nikiah Potts and I am a 16 year old special effects makeup artist. I have been in the Haunted Attraction Industry for 3 years, and am on my way to the 4th. I started my own company called Fearwithin Special Effects Makeup. I have been passionate about makeup for 3 years and hope to do it full time one day. Currently, i am working with basic supplies that most artists consider to be beginners tools. I would like to change that, but i don't have the money to build my kit up to what I would like it to be. Unfortunately, i have done just about everything that I can with the supplies that I currently have in my kit. I want to further expand my skill set and keep practicing what i love to do, so that it will allow for more oppurtunities for me in the makeup industry. Special Effects Makeup is expensive, but is pretty much a one time investment. So, once i raise the money i need i will be able to learn more and expand my level of skill. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need any help that I can get. The optimal amount would be the $1,250 because that would allow me to buy everything i need to really start learning everything about this wonderful art form. The money is going towards an airbrush makeup system, airbrush makeup, alcohol activated makeup, and materials to begin sculpting and making professional masks and prosthetic appliances. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When you contribute money, there are incentives. </p>
<p>See ""Perks"" below to see what your money can get you besides one extremely happy artist.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Special Effects Makeup is my life. It means the world to me, but i just don't have the money to continue doing more advanced makeups. The littlest amount of money will help me out. I just want to be able to express myself creatively and start planning for my career. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, share my project and help me get the word out about my makeup! </p>

This will be the first full-showing of the collected work and will become a traveling exhibit, available to schools, community centers, and museums.
In addition to private viewings for school and community groups, we are organizing 5 separate programs to bring people to the exhibit. This programming will serve as the template for programming at future exhibits.

Amon Muhammad (a Durham-based minister in the Nation of Islam who helped to organize the Million Man March) and Omisade Burney-Scott (an activist consultant and mother of two boys, who supported the Million Man March). The panel will be moderated by the Rev. Carl Kenney (a faith leader, cultural commentator, and an award-winning columnist who attended the Million Man March).
• The People United Part I - A Pre-Election Townhall Meeting on Oct. 30 (panelists TBA in October 2012)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Larime Taylor is a disabled mouth artist living in California. Life on $750 a month from Social Security isn’t easy, so he supplements his income with his art. All proceeds from his art help to support Larime and his disabled artist wife, Danielle.</p>
<p>Larime draws with his mouth on a Wacom Cintiq tablet generously provided by Wacom. All artwork is digital – there are no ‘original’ or ‘hardcopy’ versions – and finished art is provided in hi-res, print-ready .TIF format.</p>
<p>He has limited access to video, so has no video to share at this time. You can see his art at <a href=""http://larimetaylor.com/?page_id=7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://larimetaylor.com/?page_id=7</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All pledges will go towards the purchase of things Larime needs to better his life and improve his art. Stylus pens for his Wacom tablet, more RAM for his computer, a better video card, stock photos for referencing - it's all related to helping him be a successful artist and get off of Social Security. </p>
<p>Anything over his art needs will go to towards buying clothing and household items Larime desperately needs for his family as they live below the poverty line.</p>
<p>Perks will be art, all drawn by Larime.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is about helping me become self-sufficient, helping me live a better life, and helping me to be able to provide more or my family. This is, bluntly, about changing my world and helping me get out of poverty on my own skills and talents.</p>
<p>I have a successful Kickstarter campaign for a comic book I'm trying to make, but those funds are strictly for paying the production costs and shipping of rewards. This is a general plea to improve my life and my art.</p>

<p>Tieme de Waard is a young adventurer from Zwolle, The Netherlands. He has spent most his life traveling Europe and Asia, but has now set his mind on the renovation of a 1941 wooden fisherman's ship. Merlan. Tieme funds it by working as a carpenter, but his finances are running low and the ship is still not ready for the winter. Due to the financial crisis, there is not a lot of work for him and all the time he spends on making money, the renovation stagnates.</p>
<p>To me, it is clear that Tieme will need a lot more money to be able to ever finish the renovation. He has been working on it for a year now, and came quite a long way, but it will still take a lot of work and effort to bring the ship back to the state it deserves.</p>
<h3 class=""western"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The project needs about $10.000 to finish. This will be spent on the fundamental construction of the ship, as well as the realization of new interior. Even if the goal amount of money won't be realized, all money funded will go to the renovation of the ship!</p>
<h3 class=""western"">The Impact</h3>
<p>Merlan is one of a few 1940's wooden trawlers still sailing. Tieme his plan is to sail Merlan across the entire globe. Showing the impact of one man's effort and the ability to realize your dreams, as long as you stay persistent and do what has to be done.</p>
<p>It is an inspiring story. This is why during the renovation and during the travels following it, I will be making a documentary about him and his perseverance concerning this project.

<p><em>Impermanence</em> is the tenth original collaborative performance presented by Art as Action on November 9-10 at The Dairy Performance Space in Boulder, CO. A collage of diverse art genres and performer’s backgrounds, experiences and ideas, <em>Impermanence </em>will be entertaining, thought provoking and inspiring by inviting performers and audience members to reflect on the tension between holding on and letting go – a common human experience at the root of many exhilarating and/or painful events throughout life.</p>
<h2><strong><em>What is the Artivist Process?</em></strong></h2>
<p>An inherent part of Art as Action performances is the Artivist Process. At our monthly Artivist Sessions, contributing Artivists come together and present their pieces in-progress. Participants offer constructive feedback that provides opportunities for discussion, debate, discovery and brainstorming.</p>
<p>Art as Action performances bring together members of various art communities and allow artists the opportunity to collaborate and transcend the boundaries between art genres. This Artivist Process impacts artists and audience members alike by showcasing unique, creative perspectives on the human experience, prominent social issues, and artistic themes in everyday life.</p>

<h2 align=""center""> </h2></div>","What is Impermanence?
Impermanence is the tenth original collaborative performance presented by Art as Action on November 9-10 at The Dairy Performance Space in Boulder, CO. A collage of diverse art genres and performer’s backgrounds, experiences and ideas, Impermanence will be entertaining, thought provoking and inspiring by inviting performers and audience members to reflect on the tension between holding on and letting go – a common human experience at the root of many exhilarating and/or painful events throughout life.
What is the Artivist Process?
An inherent part of Art as Action performances is the Artivist Process. At our monthly Artivist Sessions, contributing Artivists come together and present their pieces in-progress. Participants offer constructive feedback that provides opportunities for discussion, debate, discovery and brainstorming.
Art as Action performances bring together members of various art communities and allow artists the opportunity to collaborate and transcend the boundaries between art genres. This Artivist Process impacts artists and audience members alike by showcasing unique, creative perspectives on the human experience, prominent social issues, and artistic themes in everyday life.

There are so many worthy causes – why should I put my precious dollars into Art as Action?

<p><strong><em>Fact &amp; Fiction</em></strong></p>
<p>The stories we learn about individuals--whether they be historical or taken from recent headlines--can be incomplete narratives. We learn facts and statistics, or sensationalized intimate details that are used to push an agenda or to sell interest in a publication. Since we are so fond of colorful stories, I thought it would be interesting if the events that describe non-fictional characters were actually taken from fiction. For example, using part of the prologue from Ralph Ellison's ""Invisible Man"" (where the character is describing his frustration of not being seen) with the image of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassin, James Earl Ray, provides a method of insight into an otherwise incomprehensible mind.  Another image from this proposed series is that of a child soldier with text from the ""Lord of the Flies"", a story where children established their own laws and advantages of a newly established civilization. Using these fictional stories is not meant for entertainment. These classic tales of the imagination are tools that frame these individuals as human beings who made decisions and may have been forced into events that we would all find challenging . The fiction is meant to establish empathy and invite introspection upon the actions of these persons.  Knowledge is not a mere quantity--it also permits a quality of understanding to be cherished and shared.</p>
<p>-- Rodney Ewing</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Words from the curator of <em>USSSA</em>:</strong></p>
<p>""I wish I had Rodney as an art instructor when I was growing up.  He is living proof that the arts are not just an industry to make things ""look cool"" or to fool you into buying something.  His work compels me.  I marvel at his technique and in a matter of moments I realize--I am immersed in feelings--I have connected with the character in his work.  I find myself relating to an image.""</p>
<p>Rodney is an emerging artist to watch--his work has reached a sophistication in recent years that has much to teach us about moving into the 21st century.  Early in our conversations, Rodney and I aligned over an interest in Howard Zinn's seminal work ""A People's History of the United States.""  I noticed that in addition to being an artist, Rodney is an eclectic historian. He has learned his lessons from books, both fact and fiction, as well as from the stories of the people in his own life.  At one point in our conversation he sounds like a psychologist and, at another, he becomes a social theorist.  In all cases, he is a wondrous human being.  He has learned from the best and the worst of the decades behind us and what may be strictly political for some, is grounded in human experience for Rodney.""</p>
<p>As my child grows up, I would love for Rodney to teach him how to draw; how to see the world through another person's eyes, how to appreciate the values and beliefs of ""the other,"" and to learn that mere tolerance is of no benefit to the profound lessons yet to be learned through genuine empathy and respect.""</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>How your donation will help:</strong></p>
<p>Rodney's drawings for USSSA are some of the best examples of the human condition put onto paper.  The subjects include child soldiers and the despair of the assassin mind.  Sadly, these perspectives have not fallen to be obsolete but may in fact be more relevant than ever.  These large drawings will be installed back-to-back and hang from the ceiling such that viewers can witness these art works from either side and from more than one perspective.  Your donation will help afford the materials, shipping, and hardware for the installation of his work.  Any funds beyond his goal will provide Rodney with transportation to promote the USSSA in a town near you!</p>
<p>As an artist with a growing reputation, Rodney's prints are sure to be an attractive perk and a keen investment.  Please share Rodney's project with anyone you know who supports the arts or, more simply, a compassion for others.</p>

<p>Thirteen contemporary artists will be forming “a more perfect union” in the month leading up to the Presidential Election, 2012. The project, “USSSA (united secret society of subversive artists),” will feature a highly diverse group of artists; all politically invested in the arts. They are educators, activists and organizers. The artists of USSSA will each create an installation around a theme of her or his choice. Through innovations to the curatorial model, this project becomes a venture where each artist presents a personally relevant perspective and engages the project as a space to work toward equal terms of support, respect and resolution. In bringing a collective voice to the issues that are most important to us, this group of artists will be calling attention to the dynamics of democratic process, documenting our innovative forms of collaboration, and bringing form to the patterns of real and actual change.</p>

<p>The <em>Twisted Upright House</em> is one of 35 Structures that will grace Burning Man's <em>Circle of Regional Effigies</em> this year.  An exciting project, it combines the efforts of the North Bay Burners, the SF North Bay Burning Man <em>Northern California Regional</em> network-a living matrix of creative burners that spans the coast from Marin County all the way up to Del Norte County-and <em>Pyroglyphics</em>, a Fire Arts team based in Humboldt County.  </p>
<p>The <em>Twisted Upright House</em> will stand 20 feet tall, with a base diameter of six feet, and will sit off-center on an island 63  feet in circumference.  Tall, slender, and eight-sided, it will stand 1/3 the scale of  its real-world inspiration, but will <em>turn</em>125 degrees from the base to its apex, giving the lighthouse a strong and fluid<em>twist </em>to its architecture. This <em>twisting </em>will be visually reinforced by an equal <em>shift</em> in its doorway, windows and railings, and punctuated further by the island itself:</p>
<p>The island will be made of driftwood that is laid out in concentric swirls emanating from the lighthouse base and will radiate out to the coast, tracing the layout of the golden ratio, so that the arching lines on its surface will connect with and visually reinforce the twisting corners of the lighthouse.</p>
<p>The island’s elevation will be two feet at the base of the lighthouse, and will slope down  to ground level at its coastline.  Off to one side of the island will stand a small, weathered pier, extending out beyond the coast’s perimeter.  The playa floor surrounding the island will be washed in low-lit blue light to simulate the sea.   We hope that the overall effect will be one of an elegant and gracefully illuminated coastal-scene benevolently manipulated by a greater and mischievous power. </p>

<p>We are already over halfway to our goal.  We have raised over four thousand dollars towards the $8500 budget estimated to build our lighthouse and get it out to the playa.  We have what it takes to get the project started, and we will be posting updates as the build begins.</p>

</ul></div>","《日本語はこちら》Hi. My name is Yuzuri Nagai, and I am a botanical dye artist living in Tokyo.Journeying into Blue: journeyingintoblue.comI create natural dye from my organic, home-grown plants. I also grow my own cotton and work with other natural fibers. In spring, I prepare the soil and plant the seeds.In summer, I harvest the dye plants and dye with brilliant, gentle, elegant colors from nature.In autumn, I harvest cotton and seeds for the next year.In winter, I prepare the fibers and spin thread. It’s been such an honor to learn from the rich tradition of ancient Japanese dyeing methods  and work in sync with the rhythm of nature. Exhibition: BEYOND COLORS  I am going to host my very first exhibition “BEYOND COLORS” in Tokyo from April 2nd to 5th this year together with the amazing painter kimi, who is based in the Tohoku area of Japan. The focus of the exhibition is to create a space for visitors to pause and reflect on what’s beyond the colors they see, appreciating the depth of dimension that colors bring into our lives.  My hope is also to do my part to revive the lost art of traditional Japanese plant dyeing. I will also be partnering up with amazing performers to host a side event of music and spoken word (in-person/online *available for participants from overseas,  Japanese/no translation provided). I will also be hosting a botanical dye workshop during the exhibition (in-person only).  The exhibition will be held in Tokyo, but don’t worry! There will also be an online showcase (both in English & Japanese) afterwards, and you can join from wherever you are for FREE!  Why support?Working with materials from nature is a very time consuming process. It can cost quite a lot to prepare environmentally-friendly supplies too. Not to mention, renting a gallery is expensive as well. So then why am I doing this? Because I believe in ART!! Art is FUNDAMENTAL to our being, and we all need it to become better, deeper and more whole. I would love to invite you into this meaningful and exciting project and make this happen together as a team!  What We Need & What You Will GetThe money will be used towards:

Until July 2016, the directors of MILS ran a gallery space - MILS Gallery - out of an unoccupied shop-front located on Randle Street, Surry Hills.This campaign is to raise money for the independent production of an art book documenting the exhibitions held at MILS Gallery throughout the 7 years of its existence.</i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473391138/supernova-05-vlad_grvpmx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></i></p><h2>The Importance of the Fringe Art Book</h2><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Works of art often last forever, or nearly so. But exhibitions themselves, especially gallery exhibitions, are like flowers; they bloom and then they die. It is important that they be recorded, because exhibitions – especially contemporary art exhibitions -establish and administer the cultural meanings of art. Part spectacle, part socio-historical event, exhibitions are the primary site of exchange in the political economy of art. Since the advent of cheap colour-printing in the 1960s, art books and exhibition catalogues have become the most common way for institutions to memorialise these events, in an assemblage of colour-printed photographs, and writing about the artist(s) and works depicted. These books are intended as contributions to scholarship as much as books that are likely to appeal to many general readers. Importantly, they constitute a form through which artists, curators, or anyone at all, can engage with art history outside of the academy. But, in 2016, exhibition catalogues remain the preserve of institutions that can afford them; there is a vast disconnect between the contribution that fringe galleries and artist-run initiatives (ARIs) make to local art culture, and their means of recording those developments for art history. What we need is support for a new category of art book: one that could be published independently, by emerging curators. Crowd funding and social media have opened up new possibilities for emerging artists and curators to realise themselves whilst remaining outside of ‘the institution’; enabling ARIs to self-publish their own catalogue books is incredibly important for the preservation of a genuinely alternative and experimental art culture.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473390358/gallery_-_1a_mv6ta0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>About MILS Gallery</h2><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><span>MILS Gallery began when Rosselli, at the age of 21, decided to occupy the empty ground floor space of his building, a triangular-shaped apartment block, where he was living on the third floor. The co-directors of MILS were his friends - fellow students at the National Art School - and the space was initially used to showcase the work of other practicing art students. At the time, the streets just east of Sydney’s Central Station were home to a number of artist-run initiatives; MILS co-existed amongst First Draft Gallery, Chalk Horse, China Heights, Serial Space and Gaffa Space.</span></p><p>While some of the inner-Sydney ARIs have continued successfully in new locations, supported by government grants, it was inevitable that most would close as soon as their directors’ capacity to run them fell short. Out-of-date websites do not suffice as a record - the life of these galleries, its artists, and exhibitions, have vanished into the personal memories of the people who participated in their existence.</p><p>MILS matured alongside its artists, developing a stable of regular contributors who had grown up with the gallery. With the time, energy and thinking space that this provided, the MILS directors became increasingly interested in seeking out and exhibiting international artists from non-Western cultures. Over the years, MILS introduced their inner-Sydney community to contemporary output from Iran, Syria, Inuit Canada, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Ghana, and China, amongst others.</p><p>In July, 2016 the building that MILS Gallery occupied was sold to property developers as part of a greater construction project that includes the buildings where Gaffa and Artspace once resided.</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473391668/supernova-03-mouneer_q5ozrh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></h2><h2>The Book Project</h2><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>Rosselli, MILS’ primary director, saw the tragedy in allowing the ephemera of artworks, photographic documentation, exhibition invitations and texts, to languish invisibly and incoherently within the algorithmic trenches of the MILS website, his personal computer hard drive, and in the storage spaces of his apartment. Since the closure of the gallery in July, he has set about gathering, editing, and compiling all documentation of MILS’ exhibitions into an intimate, historical catalogue of the artists’ work. The book is being produced in collaboration with two of MILS most esteemed artists, Eko Bang Bang Wisnu (Indonesia) and Huw Lewis (Sydney), who each designed a cover. He has now completed a digital version of the book that contains over 450 images of artworks, by over 120 artists. The published book will feature an introductory essay by Sydney-based writer Anna Georgia Mackay, and several essays by other writers and artists who were affiliated with the gallery.<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><h2></h2><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473638351/supernova-08-eko1_kbbecp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h2>Our Request</h2><h4>Costs:</h4><div>We will be printing onshore with Inscope books who have quoted us $4,860.00  for 80 copies.  </div><div>

</div><p></p><p></p></div>","SnapshotMILS is a Sydney-based non-for-profit organisation that was founded by Adriano Rosselli in 2009. Until July 2016, the directors of MILS ran a gallery space - MILS Gallery - out of an unoccupied shop-front located on Randle Street, Surry Hills.This campaign is to raise money for the independent production of an art book documenting the exhibitions held at MILS Gallery throughout the 7 years of its existence.The Importance of the Fringe Art BookWorks of art often last forever, or nearly so. But exhibitions themselves, especially gallery exhibitions, are like flowers; they bloom and then they die. It is important that they be recorded, because exhibitions – especially contemporary art exhibitions -establish and administer the cultural meanings of art. Part spectacle, part socio-historical event, exhibitions are the primary site of exchange in the political economy of art. Since the advent of cheap colour-printing in the 1960s, art books and exhibition catalogues have become the most common way for institutions to memorialise these events, in an assemblage of colour-printed photographs, and writing about the artist(s) and works depicted. These books are intended as contributions to scholarship as much as books that are likely to appeal to many general readers. Importantly, they constitute a form through which artists, curators, or anyone at all, can engage with art history outside of the academy. But, in 2016, exhibition catalogues remain the preserve of institutions that can afford them; there is a vast disconnect between the contribution that fringe galleries and artist-run initiatives (ARIs) make to local art culture, and their means of recording those developments for art history. What we need is support for a new category of art book: one that could be published independently, by emerging curators. Crowd funding and social media have opened up new possibilities for emerging artists and curators to realise themselves whilst remaining outside of ‘the institution’; enabling ARIs to self-publish their own catalogue books is incredibly important for the preservation of a genuinely alternative and experimental art culture.About MILS GalleryMILS Gallery began when Rosselli, at the age of 21, decided to occupy the empty ground floor space of his building, a triangular-shaped apartment block, where he was living on the third floor. The co-directors of MILS were his friends - fellow students at the National Art School - and the space was initially used to showcase the work of other practicing art students. At the time, the streets just east of Sydney’s Central Station were home to a number of artist-run initiatives; MILS co-existed amongst First Draft Gallery, Chalk Horse, China Heights, Serial Space and Gaffa Space.While some of the inner-Sydney ARIs have continued successfully in new locations, supported by government grants, it was inevitable that most would close as soon as their directors’ capacity to run them fell short. Out-of-date websites do not suffice as a record - the life of these galleries, its artists, and exhibitions, have vanished into the personal memories of the people who participated in their existence.MILS matured alongside its artists, developing a stable of regular contributors who had grown up with the gallery. With the time, energy and thinking space that this provided, the MILS directors became increasingly interested in seeking out and exhibiting international artists from non-Western cultures. Over the years, MILS introduced their inner-Sydney community to contemporary output from Iran, Syria, Inuit Canada, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Ghana, and China, amongst others.In July, 2016 the building that MILS Gallery occupied was sold to property developers as part of a greater construction project that includes the buildings where Gaffa and Artspace once resided.The Book ProjectRosselli, MILS’ primary director, saw the tragedy in allowing the ephemera of artworks, photographic documentation, exhibition invitations and texts, to languish invisibly and incoherently within the algorithmic trenches of the MILS website, his personal computer hard drive, and in the storage spaces of his apartment. Since the closure of the gallery in July, he has set about gathering, editing, and compiling all documentation of MILS’ exhibitions into an intimate, historical catalogue of the artists’ work. The book is being produced in collaboration with two of MILS most esteemed artists, Eko Bang Bang Wisnu (Indonesia) and Huw Lewis (Sydney), who each designed a cover. He has now completed a digital version of the book that contains over 450 images of artworks, by over 120 artists. The published book will feature an introductory essay by Sydney-based writer Anna Georgia Mackay, and several essays by other writers and artists who were affiliated with the gallery.Our RequestCosts:We will be printing onshore with Inscope books who have quoted us $4,860.00  for 80 copies.

<p><b>C</b>ommon <b>A</b>rea <b>M</b>aintenance is a new 3000 sq. ft community gallery space in the heart of downtown Seattle,
designed to offer affordable workspace and direct community access to art. Our
goal is to amplify Seattle's artistic vitality, and we need your support!</p>
<p>CAM will welcome <i>you</i> and the rest of the
community to celebrate arts and culture via enriching events, such as
performances, readings, video installations and pop shops. We will deepen community
involvement in the arts through the use of our storefront as a public art
gallery and regular open door hours—promoting consistent exposure to the inner
workings of our artistic ventures!</p>
<p>Your
contribution will provide the community and emergent artists with opportunities
for art engagement, and connect artists with their art by offering working-class
artists affordable space where they can create and have curatorial
opportunities. Our space will be able to provide up to 10+ artists with
personal and collaborative workspace, and offer curatorial and creative
involvement for artists in the community at large.</p>
<p>We
are looking to generate enough capital to begin renovating the space. To
close our funding gap we need to raise 20,000.00 dollars!</p>

<p>My name is Timothy Firth. I am a full-time working artist here in Seattle, WA. My personal practice is strongly directed by interactivity, participation and the belief that accessibility leads to greater forms of expression—the development of Common Area Maintenance is in part guided by those keywords and will help lay the foundation for the work we do together in the future.</p>
<p> As Seattle inevitably continues to grow and change, I believe that individual artists and arts supporters are the ones with the power to promote change that will keep our cultural programs and organizations alive.</p>

</div></div>","CAM: A NEW ARTS AND CULTURAL SPACE


Common Area Maintenance is a new 3000 sq. ft community gallery space in the heart of downtown Seattle,
designed to offer affordable workspace and direct community access to art. Our
goal is to amplify Seattle's artistic vitality, and we need your support!
CAM will welcome you and the rest of the
community to celebrate arts and culture via enriching events, such as
performances, readings, video installations and pop shops. We will deepen community
involvement in the arts through the use of our storefront as a public art
gallery and regular open door hours—promoting consistent exposure to the inner
workings of our artistic ventures!
Your
contribution will provide the community and emergent artists with opportunities
for art engagement, and connect artists with their art by offering working-class
artists affordable space where they can create and have curatorial
opportunities. Our space will be able to provide up to 10+ artists with
personal and collaborative workspace, and offer curatorial and creative
involvement for artists in the community at large.
We
are looking to generate enough capital to begin renovating the space. To
close our funding gap we need to raise 20,000.00 dollars!
2125 2nd Ave. Seattle, WA 98121
HOW EXACTLY
WILL YOUR SUPPORT BENEFIT THE PROJECT?
All of the money you donate will
exclusively be used to renovate the building:


$950- An updated ADA compliant bathroom, so
everybody, without exception, will have equal access to the space! 


$1,820 - Electrical system updates: Let
there be lights!

$6,500 - We are cutting a hole in the floor
and adding an alternating tread staircase down
to the basement! This will give us an extra 1,000 sq. ft of space to
work with while keeping everyone connected.

$5,300 - An amazing wall to
separate the gallery space from the work environment. The wall will
be jointed and rest on over-sized casters, allowing it to fold up for open-space events! 


$2,550 - We get to patch and paint the walls, too! Remember, this old building needs a lot of love!

$2,500 - Permits
Any money raised beyond our goal will go toward further renovation!



Just a few of the holes we have to patch to make this building happy again! 
THE LIGHTS ARE GETTING BRIGHTER IN BELLTOWN: Our new arts community will be in the great company of several longstanding and incoming local businesses, including: Theatre Schmeater, Object, Crybaby Studios, The Holocaust Center, and Suyama Space among many others. 
HELP US KEEP THE ARTS ALIVE & WELL IN SEATTLE!
During a time when many artists’ workspaces are closing or becoming financially inaccessible, many artists are forced to halt production or search for affordable work space outside of the city--ultimately bleeding Seattle of its artistic vibrancy. 
Please support us in the creation of an affordable art space that benefits the whole community by keeping art local!  
                                    5x3.5 foot internally lit sign, to be used as an alternative exhibition space.  A unique opportunity for exposure and interactivity! 
OUR DESIGN WILL PROMOTE INCLUSIVITY ON MULTIPLE LEVELS!
We want to break art out of isolation: Through our events, open door hours, and storefront gallery, we hope to mend the gap that can exist between artists and the surrounding community. We aspire to unmask the creative process by encouraging community interaction with working artists.


Our simultaneously intimate and open workspaces will enable communal opportunities such as, collaborative idea making, skill sharing, and access to tools and materials—all of which multiply artistic possibilities!


Open Formatted Workspace


HELLO





My name is Timothy Firth. I am a full-time working artist here in Seattle, WA. My personal practice is strongly directed by interactivity, participation and the belief that accessibility leads to greater forms of expression—the development of Common Area Maintenance is in part guided by those keywords and will help lay the foundation for the work we do together in the future.
 As Seattle inevitably continues to grow and change, I believe that individual artists and arts supporters are the ones with the power to promote change that will keep our cultural programs and organizations alive.

Other Ways You Can Help


 Please, even if you can't donate, make sure to
share this campaign with other people who are dedicated to maintaining arts in
Seattle. Arts and Cultural spaces are what make a city livable—art is the beat
of a community's heart. Let's keep Seattle alive and vibrant!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of six students from IESA Arts &amp; Culture Paris, all of us coming from different countries of the world: Brasil, China, Germany, Italy and Russia. <br/>We started this project a school-driven project, but with time it became a lot more: it became a project that is so close to our hearts that we decided to create a crowdfunding page to make it possible at all costs. </p>
<p>The topic of the exhibition is very hot nowadays, and it's time for us too to speak out: we present nine contemporary artists who suffered from sexual abuse or that are very close to the subject and that produced artworks to overcome it.</p>
<p>Making this exhibition possible will help an entire community to have the tools to understand partriarchy a lot better and to start fighting it actively.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As we would like to make this a charity event too, we kept the costs as low as possible, to be able to give all the profits to an NGO that works with this topic*. The goal of this campaign is not enough to make it a beautiful and complete exhibition, but it's enough to make it happen. <br/>More specifically, the funds will go to the following:<br/>- the venue<br/>- the transportation of the artworks<br/>- the installation material<br/>- the printing material</p>
<p>* If you are a French resident and you want an invoice for tax purposes (donations are deductible from taxes), please contact us directly before donating on this crowdfunding page!</p>
<p>We designed perks to give to the donors with an exclusive illustration designed by Silvia Bocchero, but we don't know if we can afford the production of them. We decided to give everything we can to the NGO, so you can be sure that no money is wasted. If we exceed the goal we set here we will produce the perks and they will be sent to all of you!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536676527/z9je7htvq3az2o2bekai.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If we don't reach the goal, the exhibition will happen anyway, but it will have less impact and less professionality. We are investing a lot too in this and we hope to make it worth it!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many people are already believing in us: the NGO we are working with, the non-profit Led By Her, that will be our partner, the venue, the artists. Everyone is doing this almost or completely for free, collaborating with us for a very good cause. Some artists are willing to donate some works to raise money to donate to the NGO. <br/>You can certainly feel how dear this topic is for all of us, and how urgent it is to adress it in active ways. We believe that art can heal wounds, maybe we can help healing this wound of the world.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenge for us is to find sponsors: given the delicate topic, many companies (too many, actually) don't want to be associated with it, believing that it will have a negative impact on their marketing strategies. We have faced many nos, just because of this. This is why we need this crowdfunding to work!</p>

<p>If you can't donate, this is perfectly acceptable! You can help by sharing this campaign, or by sharing the event in the different social media. People have to know about this!</p>

</p><p><b>Esercizi di Visione</b>

<p><b>Intro</b></p>
<p>Invitata a realizzare una mostra
nello spazio di AlbumArte, ho pensato ad un progetto che risponda alla domanda:
può lo spazio performare o possiamo noi performare lo spazio?  Ho dunque elaborato alcuni esercizi di
visione, dedicati esclusivamente allo spazio di <a href=""http://www.albumarte.org/chiara-mu-from-here-to-eternity/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AlbumArte</a>. I fondi raccolti
serviranno a sostenere parte delle spese di produzione della mostra. </p>
<p><b>Gli Esercizi di Visione qui proposti sono invece dedicati a te che
mi sosterrai.</b></p>
<p><b>Se accetti, ogni esercizio ti mostrerà come guardare intorno a te
e la città attraverso il racconto di un modo e un tempo diversi di percezione. </b></p>

2002 alla scuola E. Rolli di Roma, ha vissuto a Londra per 10 anni, ove ha
conseguito il diploma biennale di Master in Fine Art al Chelsea College of Art
and Design. Chiara Mu opera esclusivamente nell'ambito di interventi specifici
su luogo e/o situazione, utilizzando installazioni, performance e video come
modalità preferenziali di lavoro. Si definisce una ‘<i>time-based artist’ </i>che
abita in modo specifico spazi e tematiche, creando strategie relazionali tra
luogo, oggetti e presenza del corpo, sua e dei visitatori. Intende intervenire
in modo intimo e provocatorio sulla qualità del tempo di fruizione di chi
esperisce il lavoro, mettendo in discussione il ruolo stesso del visitatore ed
il suo posizionarsi rispetto all’opera. Ha collaborato negli anni con diverse
realtà <i>underground </i>e noprofit inglesi ed italiane, tra cui “Cambridge
Artworks Gallery” a Cambridge (UK), “Five Years Gallery” e Yinka Shonibare
“Guest Projects Space” a Londra e “Condotto C” a Roma. Ha poi collaborato con
la Galleria “Edieuropa-Qui Arte Contemporanea” a Roma e “CIAC” Museo di Arte
Contemporanea di Genazzano (Roma). Ha prodotto performances site-specific per
il Comune di Venezia ed il Comune di Milano ed e’ stata artist resident in Cina

</p><p>Exercises in Vision are performative exercises, designed and

<p>This art project originated  from the process of elaboration of my next exhibition ""From
Here to Eternity"", to be held in February at the non profit space “AlbumArte”
in Rome.</p>
<p>Invited to have an exhibition in the new space of AlbumArte, I decided
to create a project in order to deal with this recurrent question of mine: can the
space perform or can we perform the space? I then developed some exercises in
vision, specifically  for AlbumArte
and the raised amount  will support
part of the production costs of the show.</p>
<p>The Exercises in Vision proposed here are, instead, dedicated to
you, asking for your support.</p>
<p>If you accept this aesthetic relationship with me, each exercise
will show you how to look at the outside and the city through exploring another time and another
perception of what surrounds us.</p>
<p>So, would you you take my hand?</p>
<p>Asking for donations and offering in return exercises in vision –through
clues that you will receive digitally or by phone or by simply walking together – it is my
way to connect the concept of economic value to the practice of Performance Art.</p>
<p>I am interested in exploring a method of applying an ‘economic
dignity’ to Performance Art; when it is taken as a relational and live event, in fact,
it seems ontologically and historically not a sustainable form of profit,
except  when it is subjugated to be sold as photography, video, documentation of any kind, texts...</p>
<p>This crowd funding campaign aims to support the Italian Art by helping
the realization of a complex work of art for the exhibition. The aimed support
becomes essential for the artistic creation, both conceptually and in practice.</p>
<p>Supporters are allowed to enter into a relationship with the
artist during the process of creation of the works by having a direct experience of the artist's practice; just donating and receiving the chance of experiencing together a new way of gazing the world.</p>
<p>The dynamics of crowd funding seems very suitable to finance ""time-based""
art, which is not aesthetically conveyed by the production of objects but by
the production of time and space. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This campaign therefore does not offer objects to collect. The

<p>The exhibition will illustrate how this process relates to the space of AlbumArte, not revolving around the outside space as proposed here but dealing with an inner one.</p>
<p>Your support will be essential for:</p>
<p>- Bearing the costs for the realization of the exhibition;</p>
<p>- Realizing a project of web documentary to show what really

indipendentemente dalla loro nazionalità, origine o religione, ed è  impegnata sin dalla sua fondazione nella
promozione della condizione femminile nella società.

La Adei-Wizo opera in Italia dal 1927 ed è affiliata alla WIZO , una ONG laica, apolitica,  impegnata nell'azione sociale al servizio di donne e bambini in Israele sin dal 1920.

Il Nostro Progetto:""Arte per la Pace"" è una mostra itinerante di 35 dipinti che sarà ospitata in otto Paesi ed arriverà in Italia, a Roma, il 18 Ottobre 2015.

I dipinti della mostra sono nati dalle mani di un gruppo di donne ebree, cristiane arabe, musulmane e circasse residenti ad Afula, a Nazareth e in altri villaggi circostanti. Le donne, tra i 17 e gli 80 anni, sono originarie della Lituania, di Umm-Al-Fahm, di Tiberiade, della  Romania, di Nazareth, di Isfahan, dell' Argentina e delle montagne del Caucaso.Il gruppo di donne e' nato nel Dicembre 2013 e, da allora, si riunisce due ore alla settimana con Sheila, insegnante di pittura, e David, il direttore del centro
WIZO di Afula , per dipingere l'ulivo (simbolo di pace) e per condividere storie di vita vissuta e prelibati piatti fatti in casa afferenti alle diverse tradizioni.Da questo gruppo e' nata una prima Mostra inaugurata presso la Galleria Comunale di Afula e il Centro Culturale Francese di Nazareth.Attraverso l'Arte, le Donne dell’Ulivo  sono magnificamente riuscite a costruire un mondo di tolleranza, amicizia e condivisione.

Il Nostro Obbiettivo:Il nostro obbiettivo è portare la Mostra in Italia  per ""importare"" attraverso l'arte quel messaggio di condivisione, tolleranza ed amicizia che il gruppo di donne di Afula è riuscito ad esprimere nonostante le tensioni che permeano la vita israeliana. 


Il loro approccio ci riguarda tutti: rivela un ""altro"" possibile.Il vostro contributo sarà prezioso per aiutarci a realizzare questo nostro desiderio.Come Utilizzeremo i Soldi Raccolti:I soldi raccolti verranno destinati alle spese di viaggio e di soggiorno di quattro Donne del gruppo dell'Ulivo, del direttore del Centro di Afula e dell'insegnante di pittura, i quali, durante la mostra, racconteranno agli ospiti la loro esperienza. 


Dettagli Logistici:La mostra avrà luogo a Roma e sarà composta da 35 dipinti
di altrettante artiste del centro Wizo di Afula. 

L'inagurazione è prevista per il 18 Ottobre 2015, presso lo spazio espositivo Sala Maranga. Qui accoglieremo le artiste assieme al direttore del Centro Wizo di Afula e alla direttrice del laboratorio di pittura.L’ingresso alla mostra sarà gratuito.Dettagli sulla Mostra:Ogni dipinto sarà corredato da un pannello che racconta la storia

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Hi! My name is Josh Whittaker. I am a recent graduate of UNC School of the Arts. I have been making ultra low budget movies for the past few years and have finally decided to take the next step in my filmmaking journey. My senior year script ""Looking for Andrew"" is something I'm incredibly passionate about and have wanted to make for years. It's a great story that deserves to be told in the most artful, professional way possible. It is a coming of age story that is unique, relatable, and honest. A group of childhood friends return home after graduating college to discover that one of their own has mysteriously gone missing. They have one lead, and decide that during their last summer together that they are going to embark on a cross country road trip to find him and rekindle their friendships. </span></p>
<p>Moving up from the Canon 7D, hiring 'real' actors and a 'real' crew will allow us to make a heartfelt film with incredible potential on the festival circuit. </p>
</div><div>
<p>We are raising a portion of our budget through indiegogo. Our total goal is $20,000. This will go towards paying cast and crew members a modest salary, equipment rentals, post-production, props, festival entries, gas (road trip movie), and food.</p>
<p>We are offering a wide range of perks - tickets to the local private screening, DVDs, custom paintings of geese, bridge lessons, posters, private visits on set and more.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal we will still make the movie but it will have to be scaled back accordingly. This may change the shooting schedule, equipment, and post production, but we are going to do everything we can to make the best movie possible.</p>
<p>This film takes a deep and honest look at friendship, love, and sex. The characters transition into adulthood and their fading friendships are something we have all gone through and will continue to go through. This will be a very unique film that explores many deep, interesting, relatable characters.</p>
<p>Our last movie made it into the NYC Independent Film Festival. Director of Photography Ben Zschunke has a lot of experience and produced ""The Polar Bear Club"" which has done well at various festivals throughout the country.</p>
<p>We will have a very small crew, with a tight shooting schedule and a portion of our shoot will be on the road. Ben and I have both worked on various projects with little to no crew. In my previous few films I have acted as the 1st and 2nd AC, director, script supervisor, producer, sound guy, gaffer, camera operator, director of photography, and actor - typically at the same time. To have a professional support group to take over these duties and allow me to just direct will lift a huge burden.  </p>
<p>Every penny helps, but even if you can just share the word we would really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

We will have a very small crew, with a tight shooting schedule and a portion of our shoot will be on the road. Ben and I have both worked on various projects with little to no crew. In my previous few films I have acted as the 1st and 2nd AC, director, script supervisor, producer, sound guy, gaffer, camera operator, director of photography, and actor - typically at the same time. To have a professional support group to take over these duties and allow me to just direct will lift a huge burden.  
Every penny helps, but even if you can just share the word we would really appreciate it.

Con su ayuda, podemos cultivar aún más la conciencia internacional en torno a la creciente escena del arte contemporáneo en Buenos Aires, y destacar las conexiones entre el trabajo de artistas emergentes en ambas ciudades. En agradecimiento a su generoso apoyo, los artistas que participan en este proyecto han contribuido con obras de arte a esta campaña. A continuación encontrará notas de la curadora y organizadora Claudia Cortínez y arriba se puede encontrar una lista completa de los artistas expositores.--En la práctica de la fotografía, los términos retrato y paisaje han llegado a definir no sólo los géneros más tradicionales del medio, sino también los estándares de composición a la hora de ver o hacer una imagen. Retrato de un Paisaje re-enmarca estas convenciones y traza una línea entre continentes; reúne a artistas de Nueva York y Buenos Aires para proponer un punto de encuentro entre el mundo fotográfico y el físico. La exposición juega a reformatear la fotografía como un objeto en el cual la memoria y la materialidad están en primer plano, cada obra de arte desplegando sus parámetros de visualización como una experiencia física que habla de los contextos geográficos y sociales en los que fue realizada.--",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>The Project</strong></h2>
<p><strong>In the summer of 2011, I met with the Dr. Christine Soler, pediatric oncologist of the CHU- L’Archet-2 Hospital in Nice and began discussing the possibility of providing a collaborative art experience to the patients of the children’s ward. What came of this was the idea to have the children come up with a new name for their ward and design a mosaic mural that would depict the new name. Since that time the idea has grown into an international collaborative art effort called “What Goes Around Comes Around”.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>What Goes Around Comes Around</strong> is a project that will start and end with the children of the pediatric cancer ward of the CHU-L’Archet-2 hospital in Nice, France. With the help of Dr. Soler, Pascale Cozzi and the Blouses Roses of CHU-L'Archet-2 Nice, the patients of CHU-L'Archet-2 will select a new name for their ward. Patients  of CHU-L'Archet-2 and the Lenval will then decorate a part of each letter. </p>
<p> The Blouses Roses are a wonderful group of volunteers that provide creative support for hospitalized children and the elderly. The Blouses Roses of CHU-L'Archet-2 Nice; Dominique Resegotti, Bernadette Negre and Marse Garcin along with Monique Barthelemy and her team at CHU-Lenval Nice embraced the project with exceptional enthusiasm, thus providing great support for the children of these hospitals enabling them to get the project off to a great start.</p>
<p>The letters will be sent to Ms. Ana Maria Cruz’s elementary school art students, at the American International School of Budapest in Hungary, who will learn how art can be used in service learning projects and add their own original ideas to the second third of each letterform. </p>
<p>From there the letterforms will travel once again, this time to Paris, France where my daughter and her friends will add their creative ideas to the last third of each letterform. </p>
<p>The final letterforms will travel once again, this time back to Nice to be the center piece of an art installation at the ECIS – European Council of International Schools – Conference at the Acropolis Conference Hall in Nice. During the first 3 days of this conference, visitors will have the opportunity of participating in the making of the mosaic mural by gluing glass tiles onto the final collaborative letterform designs. The final mosaic mural will be completed by members of the ECIS Art Committee and presented to the CHU-L'Archet-2 on Saturday November 24, 2012.Thus completing the cycle of<strong>“What Goes Around Comes Ar</strong><strong>ound”.</strong></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact </h2>
<p>In a world filled with medicine, machines, and technology, it is amazing to see how the simple act of creating art together can make people smile. </p>
<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>My name is Stacey Wilson ""Jaco"" McMahon. I am an African American artist and art teacher living and working in Paris France.</p>
<p>A graduate of Parsons School of Design Paris, France. My experiences in the art world include many art forms ranging from graphic design to calligraphy, silk painting, and mosaic work. I began teaching art 25 years ago.</p>
<p>It is my belief that each person is born with an innate desire and ability to create art in some form and that a persons life is a quest to find these hidden talents and create art that expresses their experiences, their spirit, and life around them thus becoming an artist.</p>
<p>I come from a family of patchwork quilt makers - the Jaco’s, from Salisbury, Missouri, USA.  My journey to creating and facilitating collaborative art projects began in 1990, on a visit back home to Salisbury, when my great Aunt Edna gave me some of our family heirloom quilts along with a pile of patchwork squares. They were over 100 years old.  Aunt Edna challenged me to carry on the Jaco tradition by encouraging me to incorporate the pieces into a new quilt. Since receiving those timeless treasures, it has been my quest to find a way to incorporate the concept of a patchwork – the art of joining together different pieces of art into one unified piece, that provides protection,  not only into my art and teaching but also into my way of life.</p>
<p>In 1995 my mother, who was an amazing artist, art teacher and my mentor, died of breast cancer. She had a long battle with the disease and went through the many changes that are typical of cancer patients: mis-diagnosis, doctor changes, clinical trials, chemotherapy, radiation and all the dreadful effects that accompany these treatments. In our many trips to the hospital, I noticed that patients spent long periods sitting around with their loved ones, awaiting their various treatments. The periods that cancer patients spend in the hospital, whether short or long, are critical, distressing times. Since my mother’s death I thought about using my art skills to improve the time people spend at the hospital. But at the time, I was as yet unclear how I could do this.</p>
<p>While living and teaching art on the island of Antigua, in the Caribbean, between 2000 - 2007, I took many of my lessons out of the classroom to construct and create art installations in the community such as murals, totem poles, grafitti’d crosses. I discovered how devoted my secondary students became when they were involved in creating art that had a specific purpose and a long-term benefit. I also learned how the collaborative process of designing and creating art installations brought people of different ages, races, religions and social backgrounds together for a common goal. Since 2000, I have created, facilitated and directed over 25 collaborative art projects in Antigua, France and the USA.</p>
<p>In 2010 I lost my second parent to cancer and decided it was time to make a difference and improve the quality of life for cancer patients, particularly those in hospitals. I wanted to focus on children not only because of my love for working with young people but also because I believe that throughout the ordeal of cancer treatments there should be something positive from their time spent in hospital and that they deserve to smile.</p>
<p>Since 2000, I have been facilitating collaborative art projects and installations that range from work with teenage girls on the island of Antigua in the Caribbean to work with young people of the Summer Youth Program of the Madison Park Development Corporation in Boston,Massachusetts  to work with children with cancer in France.</p>

<p>Greetings to bridge, public art and yarn lovers!  <strong><em>Bridge For Blankets</em></strong> is a community-based knit project, and temporary public art installation, set for install on the Broadway Bridge in August, 2013, as a part of the<em> PDX Bridge Festival</em>.  2013 is the Centennial Anniversary for the Broadway Bridge, and <em><strong>Bridge For Blankets</strong> </em>is our way of drawing focus to this historical structure’s role in the Portland community.</p>
<p>This public art installation consists of 4 -18’ x 21’ knit banners hung outside the drawspans, on both the North and South sides of the Broadway Bridge.  The construction of these banners depends upon the support of 150+ knitting volunteers, local mainly to the Portland area.  After the project has been taken back down, these knit banners will be broken down into 42 - 6’ x 6’ afghans, washed, and donated to Portland area homeless shelters (i.e. Human Solutions &amp; SnoCap).</p>
<p><strong>Who is Helping Us?</strong></p>
<p>Multnomah County is lending us their skilled engineers, those that manage and care for the Broadway Bridge, to help <em><strong>Bridge For Blankets</strong></em> go up on the Broadway for the month of August.  We are very grateful for their enthusiastic support of this multi-purpose art installation, and can’t wait to see the banners brightening up this iconic, brick-red bridge.  We need help raising the funds for installation materials and equipment rental, and that is one of the reasons that we are campaigning for your support on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>The knit banners will all be constructed from a colorful array of Cascade 220 Superwash Wool – a wool that will not felt, allowing the homeless shelter recipients to wash these blankets just as they would any other blanket.  Abundant Yarns (<a href=""http://www.abundant-yarn.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.abundant-yarn.com</a>) and Cascade Yarns (<a href=""http://www.cascadeyarns.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.cascadeyarns.com/</a>) have teamed together to offer us a significant discount on the wool we need to for the project, and for that, we are delighted beyond belief.  However, just as with the installation costs, we need your assistance to pay for the large yarn order.  It costs more to create an afghan from quality natural fibers, but we also know that using natural fibers makes the resulting charitable gesture mean more to the recipients.  Please help us pay for the yarn today by making a tax-deductible donation to <em><strong>Bridge For Blankets</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>***** We have all the knitting volunteers that we require for this project.</p>

<p><strong>How You Can Help:</strong></p>
<p>We invite you to show your support and enthusiasm for what we are doing for the Portland community, and donate generously to<em><strong> Bridge For Blankets</strong></em> on this page.</p>
<p>When you make a donation of $130+ to our project today, you have paid for the yarn for one entire knit blanket.  We accept all donation levels; no donation amount is too great or too small.</p>
<p>Spread the word about this project by sharing the link to this crowdfunding page with your friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers.  Tweet, post on Facebook, and cast an even wider, and more personal, net by sharing our fundraising story via e-mail.  Want some 1/4 sheet cards to hand out to promote the project in hard copy form?  E-mail me at <strong><em>tyler.mackie@gmail.com</em></strong>.</p>
<p>We absolutely could not realize this project without your help.  Donate today, and help us bridge the gap, and restore lives for those within our homeless communities.</p>

WHO
WE ARE 
SW!PE
Magazine was founded in 2009, by artists working as guards at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. It features the diverse creative output of fellow MET guards who
are artists and writers, with work ranging from painting and performance to
short stories and critical essays. The magazine is produced and published
independently of the museum, which figures simply as the place where this particular
group became acquainted.

WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
Currently, the 127 page SW!PE Volume 2 is being prepared for printing, highlighting work that takes as it's subject the MET Museum.  As an independent magazine without
advertising, we are turning to the public for financial support.  Currently the
editors are providing funds for printing, and end up breaking even after
the magazine is sold.  Any profits are put back into the magazine for further
printing, but this doesn’t get us very far after reimbursing ourselves.  As guards our salaries are not impressive, so besides time and effort, we cannot invest the funds we require for future success.  

THE
FUTURE 
Without
outside funding, it won't be possible to realize the potential of what SW!PE
Magazine could be.  The editors envision SW!PE becoming a global
phenomenon, a magazine that shares the work of museum guards from around the
world in effect creating a vast network of emerging talent.  In order to do this, we need to increase distribution, which means printing more magazines, which means raising more funds.
Please
help us realize this vision with your support, and also, please check out
the many perks we offer in appreciation of this support.

<p>Since 1980, I have been involved in the creation and production of hundreds of independent artistic works and events.  These have included music and sound art, live music performances, video productions and screenings, graphic design, photography and written works both fictional and analytical.  These have been produced both independently, as a solo artist, and in collaboration within various groups and creative collectives.  My role in these has ranged from performer to producer to marketing and distribution management, all the way down to the nuts and bolts of administration.  </p>
<p>Throughout all of the years I've been producing, one of my primary concerns has been the preservation of these works in some form.  For the past dozen or so years, this has been focused on digitally capturing and storing this material in whatever medium has been available from compact discs to hard drives.  For the most part, these means of data storage have proven tenuous, at best.  Discs become corrupted within a couple of years, hard drives fail generally in less than five years.  Cloud storage is still prohibitively expensive and lacking in security.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, the entirety of the creative output I have been involved with resides on a single hard drive that is disturbingly showing signs of wear.  While some small portion of this material does have off site storage, a large amount of it is only on this one drive and teetering on the brink of destruction should anything befall this fragile vessel.  </p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to, at minimum, invest in at least one backup hard drive of sufficient capacity, quality and reliability to ensure that this precious data may be preserved for another few years - long enough to make it to the next point of preservation with whatever new technology may appear by then.  </p>
<p>These are not famous works.  They are known by few and loved by fewer, but they ARE loved and they DO have the potential to one day reach a larger audience should they manage to survive into an uncertain future.  By supporting this campaign, you can participate in that preservation process and become part of the story by sharing in this content and discovering it for yourself.</p>
<p>At the present time, my means are strained.  As an independent artist, I have no source of support for these works beyond what I can muster.  Employment opportunities have been few and unreliable.  Recorded music now offers virtually no opportunities for sales for producers who appeal to small audiences.  This is the only means by which I can preserve these works.  Your support is critical to the future survival of a lifetime's work.  But, best of all, you get to experience it by helping it survive.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In order to ensure the safety and preservation of the creative legacy I've invested over 30 years of my life producing, I need to purchase at least one high quality (excellent longevity &amp; reliability stats), high capacity (3-4 TB) backup hard drive.   What you will receive in return for your support will be as follows:</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Greetings fellow Geeks and Nerds.  Perhaps you're already a fan of GeekGoddess, maybe you are just hearing about us for the first time.  If you are let me take a quick moment to explain who we are.  We are a site run by two incredibly Geeky women that features pinups of equally geeky and/or nerdy ladies, our Goddesses.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong>You get to help us fund a truly EPIC GeekGoddess Calendar.  </strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Our Goddesses already have some amazing ideas and costumes in the works to make this Calendar truly spectacular.  As we go we’ll be updating with images from those shoots.  For now we can only give you a taste of the kinds of things you’ll be able to expect.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">More than simply images of our Goddesses in costume the Calendar shots will be truly EPIC, combining our lovely Goddesses with some iconic costumes and amazing scenes that just aren’t feasible when we are shooting an entire set of 60+ images for our site.  </p>

<p dir=""ltr"">By our conservative estimates the whole project will cost us at least $3,000.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This includes the cost of paying models, photographers and getting the calendars printed.  Of course, if our supporters are generous we can add and do even more amazing things.  Every penny we receive will go right back into making GeekGoddess even better and giving our fans even more geeky goodness.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the Calendar, we will also be saving some extra images from each Goddesses calendar shoot.  From these images we will be selecting one of each Goddess that will be an exclusive print available only through this fundraiser.  You won’t be able to buy it later.</p></div>","Thank you so much to everyone who has already backed our little campaign.  Due to your generosity I am happy to report that the 2014 Calendar will happen!  But we aren't done, in fact we are just getting started.

Other Ways You Can Help
Are you strapped for cash and unable to help us directly?  You can still help us get out the word using the Indiegogo share tools! 
 

Referall Contest:  
There is a new way to help GeekGoddess reach our next stretch goal.   Refer your friends to our campaign to help us reach our goal and maybe you can get a little something in return.   We have options for both individuals and companies.  
The first step:  Regardless of whether you are a company or an individual you will need to create an account on Indiegogo to participage.   Otherwise we will not be able to see the traffic you drive and give you credit for your contribution.  Once you have an account you can use Indiegogo's share tools.  
Share Tools are located at the top of the page directly below the video. 
What you might get? 
Individuals:  The person who sends the most referral traffic/donations our way will receive a free GeekGoddess T-Shirt.  
Companies:  The company who sends us the most referral traffic/donations will receive a free ad in our Calendar along with a banner on our website.
*Important*:  If you are a company and it isn't obvious from your referral name you must send us a message and let us know.  Otherwise we may treat you as an individual.   

Greetings fellow Geeks and Nerds.  Perhaps you're already a fan of GeekGoddess, maybe you are just hearing about us for the first time.  If you are let me take a quick moment to explain who we are.  We are a site run by two incredibly Geeky women that features pinups of equally geeky and/or nerdy ladies, our Goddesses.
You get to help us fund a truly EPIC GeekGoddess Calendar.  
Our Goddesses already have some amazing ideas and costumes in the works to make this Calendar truly spectacular.  As we go we’ll be updating with images from those shoots.  For now we can only give you a taste of the kinds of things you’ll be able to expect.  
More than simply images of our Goddesses in costume the Calendar shots will be truly EPIC, combining our lovely Goddesses with some iconic costumes and amazing scenes that just aren’t feasible when we are shooting an entire set of 60+ images for our site.  

By our conservative estimates the whole project will cost us at least $3,000.  
This includes the cost of paying models, photographers and getting the calendars printed.  Of course, if our supporters are generous we can add and do even more amazing things.  Every penny we receive will go right back into making GeekGoddess even better and giving our fans even more geeky goodness.  
In addition to the Calendar, we will also be saving some extra images from each Goddesses calendar shoot.  From these images we will be selecting one of each Goddess that will be an exclusive print available only through this fundraiser.  You won’t be able to buy it later.",12.0,0,"6 Campaigns

Shyla is a  body of flesh, transformed into a poem-on-napkin, trying her best to clean up the mess she's made of.

For me poetry is an act of resistance by means of self-expression, self-recognition and self-love. Poetry is breathing. There is no way to succinctly introduce what poetry is for me without acknowledging that poetry is a part of who I am but mostly what I am striving to become.

<p><i>Groundwork is a reflection on history, labor, industry, boundaries and growth. Working together, artists Carrie Iverson and Nathan Sandberg will present new works in a variety of materials on the grounds of the Pullman State Historic Site.</i><br/></p>
<p>The exhibit will take place in two parts: Part 1 will be an iron pour on the factory grounds where members of the community will be invited to participate. Part 2 will be a site-specific art installation within the Clock Tower and Administration Building.</p>
<p>“The iron pour will bring to life the community and foundry history of the factory in a dramatic and fiery way - an exciting chance for the public to participate in and learn about the processes that used to happen within the factory. We will then use some of the remnants from the pour to create a site-specific installation within the factory, supplemented by other found and existing works. This more reflective installation will offer an outside perspective on the spirit that built Pullman and the events that lead to its present state.”</p>

Groundwork is a reflection on history, labor, industry, boundaries and growth. Working together, artists Carrie Iverson and Nathan Sandberg will present new works in a variety of materials on the grounds of the Pullman State Historic Site.
The exhibit will take place in two parts: Part 1 will be an iron pour on the factory grounds where members of the community will be invited to participate. Part 2 will be a site-specific art installation within the Clock Tower and Administration Building.
“The iron pour will bring to life the community and foundry history of the factory in a dramatic and fiery way - an exciting chance for the public to participate in and learn about the processes that used to happen within the factory.

<strong><br/></strong><strong>Please Help Us Fund Wavelength’s 2012 ALL CAPS! Island Festival</strong>
</h2>
<p> The <strong>ALL CAPS! Island Festival</strong> is an annual festival of independent music, visual arts and community for ALL AGES presented by <strong>Wavelength - Toronto’s longest-running non-profit, artist-run concert series </strong>- at Artscape Gibraltar Point on Toronto Island. The fourth edition of the ALL CAPS! Island Festival will take place August 11 &amp; 12, 2012.</p>
<p class=""FillableField"">The aim of the ALL CAPS! Island Festival is <strong>to take independent music out of its usual context and make it accessible to new audiences – via affordable ticket prices and all-ages admittance.</strong> Blessed by beaches and parkland, Toronto Island is an oasis of calm just a 10 minute ferry ride from the city’s downtown core. <strong>ALL CAPS! is the only music festival at which camping is permitted within the city of Toronto!</strong></p>

<p class=""FillableField"">The ALL CAPS! Island Festival is an ambitious festival produced by Wavelength, a non-profit arts organization that is a labour of love for its organizers. Since 2010, we have staged this event with the support of small government grants and modest sponsorships. The 2011 Festival was such a surprise success – we had to turn away close to 100 people on our opening day – that we have increased the capacity of the festival by creating an outdoor stage area to meet the demand. However, increased size means increased expenses.</p>
<p class=""FillableField""> </p>

<p> <strong>Wavelength prides itself on producing cost-effective events – and offering these events to you at a reasonable, affordable ticket prices.</strong> But these costs do add up. Your support will help us produce a festival that runs smoothly for everyone!</p>
<p>Your support will assist us in covering production costs such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staging</li>
<li>Sound &amp; lighting</li>
<li>Staffing</li>
<li>Fencing</li>
<li>Licensing</li>
<li>Marketing</li>

Please Help Us Fund Wavelength’s 2012 ALL CAPS! Island Festival

 The ALL CAPS! Island Festival is an annual festival of independent music, visual arts and community for ALL AGES presented by Wavelength - Toronto’s longest-running non-profit, artist-run concert series - at Artscape Gibraltar Point on Toronto Island. The fourth edition of the ALL CAPS! Island Festival will take place August 11 & 12, 2012.
The aim of the ALL CAPS! Island Festival is to take independent music out of its usual context and make it accessible to new audiences – via affordable ticket prices and all-ages admittance. Blessed by beaches and parkland, Toronto Island is an oasis of calm just a 10 minute ferry ride from the city’s downtown core. ALL CAPS! is the only music festival at which camping is permitted within the city of Toronto!
 
About US
Wavelength has been extensively recognized for being ahead-of the curve bookers-and-essential Toronto tastemakers. Internationally recognized artists such as Broken Social Scene, Owen Pallett, Constantines, Fucked Up, The Hidden Cameras and Crystal Castles all played important early gigs at our showcase night.
The ALL CAPS! Island Festival is an ambitious festival produced by Wavelength, a non-profit arts organization that is a labour of love for its organizers. Since 2010, we have staged this event with the support of small government grants and modest sponsorships. The 2011 Festival was such a surprise success – we had to turn away close to 100 people on our opening day – that we have increased the capacity of the festival by creating an outdoor stage area to meet the demand. However, increased size means increased expenses.
 
What We Need
 Wavelength prides itself on producing cost-effective events – and offering these events to you at a reasonable, affordable ticket prices. But these costs do add up. Your support will help us produce a festival that runs smoothly for everyone!
Your support will assist us in covering production costs such as:

Staging
Sound & lighting
Staffing
Fencing
Licensing
Marketing
Publicity
Transportation
 Just as importantly, your support will also allow us to pay artists fairly. We are committed to fairly paying ALL artists that perform as part of our events.

<p><strong>Call for submissions: NEW DOWNTOWN MURAL PROJECT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Submissions due Saturday, Sept. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>[DAYTON, Ohio- </strong><em>July 22, 2012]</em> <strong>–</strong>A team of downtown arts leaders and activists consisting of Lisa Helm (Garden Station), Jerri Stanard (K-12 Gallery) and Carli Dixon (AttaGirl), is spearheading an effort to beautify a section of East Third Street with a new mural project. In much the same way as the Wayne Avenue murals at the underpass next to Garden Station, this new set of murals at Third and Webster will be selected from submissions by local artists, and a stipend will be awarded to each winning artist. The project will be partially funded by a Neighborhood Mini Grant from the City of Dayton.</p>
<p>Due to the close proximity of the 2nd Street Market, a vegetable and fruit theme has been adopted for the murals. The theme may include, but is not limited to, large scale, colorful fruits and vegetables (local to the area preferred), and related items. Abstract and non-conventional interpretations of produce are also welcomed.</p>
<p>“If some of the images were inspired by famous artists that would be an amazing transition from the HAALO project, (on 3rd Street just west of the proposed murals) completed by 30 teens from the Montgomery County Juvenile Court program, and would allow the walk-by patrons to learn about art history in a fun and memorable way” says team member Jerri Stanard of K-12 Gallery. Some ideas for submission of artwork for the underpass at Third and Webster could include: Keith Haring “Carrots”, Giuseppe Arcimboldo “Vegetable Faces”, Edward Hoppers “Ears of Corn”, Mary Cassatt’s “Cucumbers”, Georgia O’Keeffe’s “Okra” or “Green Beans”, and Tripoli’s “Tomatoes”.</p>
<p>The spaces available for painting will include the areas on the retaining wall on the southeast side of the intersection as well as sections under the overpass. Spaces on the retaining wall are approximately 13’ x13’ and the underpass spaces are 8’x 8’ squares (see attached pictures, these can be used as a submission template by printing or tracing dimensions).</p>
<p>A committee comprised of artists, area business owners and city representatives will select the winning designs. Designs will be judged based on originality, appropriateness for the space and design quality.</p>
<p>Each artist whose mural design is selected will receive $125 upon completion of each mural. Sixteen gallons of exterior paint will be available to all of the artists to share. The colors will include red, orange, yellow, light and dark green, sky blue, lilac, and purple. Also, a $75 supply stipend per mural will be given to each artist to individualize his/her palette.</p>
<p>Multiple submissions are encouraged. Submissions may be submitted in any format or size, as long as the proposed design is clearly illustrated. Artists also are encouraged to submit a resume or letter outlining their qualifications to complete this type of project.</p>
<p>Submissions are due by 6 p.m. on Saturday, September 1. Winners will be announced at Urban Nights on September 14 at an event in Garden Station.</p>
<p>Submissions can be e-mailed to daytongardenstation@gmail.com or mailed to:</p>
<p>Downtown Mural Project c/o Carli Dixon, 811 E. Third Street, Dayton, OH 45402</p>
<p>Winning artists will have until Friday, November 2, to finish their work. The murals will be unveiled that evening at First Friday festivities. “The City of Dayton grant to create more murals along East Third Streets puts us that much closer to competing with Philadelphia’s public art and becoming the destination where tourists will stay an extra day to experience all the incredible amenities we have in Dayton Ohio”, says Stanard.</p>
<p>Additional donations are also being accepted to help fund the project at <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/DaytonVeggieMurals"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.indiegogo.com/DaytonVeggieMurals</a>. “The Neighborhood Mini Grant from the city will cover the cost of about 13 murals and requires a 50% match”, says Lisa Helm. “While we will more than meet our match requirements with the value of all the volunteer hours, we need the money for paint and artist stipends. There are 37 spaces in the intersection available to paint, it would be nice to fill them all, if not with full murals at least with bright colored spaces between some of the murals “</p>
<p>Clean up days are scheduled for the morning of August 25 and 26.  Volunteers will be needed to clear brush, weeds, trash and to prime the spaces. Updates will be posted at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/GardenStation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/GardenStation</a></p>
