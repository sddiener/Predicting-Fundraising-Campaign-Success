After a very difficult bypass surgery she hasn't returned to us and we are shock as well as staying in wonder at her process. As we write this we have been sitting vigil by her bedside for over ten days and it has been 6 days since surgery - wondering when and if, she will awake. We are in profoundly deep sorrow as the chances are very slim.  Everyone is one of a kind but Sue is one in a million. As vast as the cosmos, she so often paints. We were all so certain she would come through, as she was so excited to continue in her vision, her love of teaching, and to continue the legacy of her land as a sanctuary for women.<br/></p>
<b>Sue Hoya Sellars has a vision:</b> To gather and guide others to commit art. She wanted us to experience a connection to ourselves, the land - to learn how to see - and to heal through intentional creating as anyone who has worked with her will understand and remember. She believed so strongly in the power of art to heal and as the way to connect with our consciousness that she has been working on this her entire life. We are so blessed to have a woman like this in our life a true mentor to pass on her teachings. We will continue to learn from both the legacy of her land - and the teachings from her notebooks.<br/><br/><b>How about a Barn raising</b> instead of fundraising?<br/><br/>At first our community thought of a fundraiser to help during this difficult time, as there isn't an 'estate plan' to cover the expanse of expenses that happens when someone is in this kind of life transition. But she doesn't want to be a 'cause' and this isn't a traditional fundraiser. The most important thing for her life and legacy was and is to secure her land: Terra Sophia:  20 Acres of pristine land in the beautiful Anderson Valley. So we went with a Barn Raising. So much more Sue. And so much closer to her plans to have an Art Barn on her property.<br/><br/>We have some short term goals based on where we are on the journey at this time, which is to cover her immediate expenses. And we have our eye on her larger vision - yes, a barn raising is planned.... has been planned... and this vision helps us as a community focus on her and her wishes for her land. She was very clear with her desires for her property. She has been working with students there for over twenty years and she longed to continue that into her future.<br/><br/>So we, the community, would be most grateful for your participation and support during this time - and for you to keep the eye on the larger vision with us, while we focus on what is at hand right now. Which is our dear Sue. It is a curious journey to sit with someone on the edge of life and death and ponder what is really important to them...in some ways...it is the same thing. What they would want after their death is the same thing they would want if they were living.<br/><br/>We are working to secure the land. And so we shall. <br/><br/><b>IMMEDIATE GOAL</b><br/><br/>Our immediate short term goal is to cover Sue's mortgage and immediate medical costs for the next 4 months is estimated at around 30k - anything remaining will be used towards paying off the land. <br/><br/><b>PERK CHOICES</b><br/><br/>We know the perk choices aren't all fleshed out at this time - but we wanted to offer you something tangible in gratitude for your support and participation.<br/><br/><b>Buy Art</b><br/><br/>Another way to support Sue is to purchase prints from her Fine Art America site:<br/><a href=""http://fineartamerica.com/profiles/sue-hoya-sellars.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://fineartamerica.com/profiles/sue-hoya-sel...</a><br/><br/><b>An INVITATION</b><br/>This is an invitation to work with us on the legacy of the Terra Sophia Sanctuary.

<h3>Our Story<br/>
</h3> <p></p>At Burning Man 2013, Shane Evans had a life changing experience that 
inspired him to push his artistic and technical skills to the next 
level. He decided to build a giant robot with 
fire effects and beautiful lighting that people could control. In October 2013, Shane began 
building the Robot. Over the course of 6 months a crew of volunteers 
coalesced around his vision to bring the Robot to life. Every person 
brought their skills to the project and learned more, the support 
continued and a community formed. We Are The Robots. In June 2014 the 
Robot appeared at a festival of 2,000 people in Colorado to much 
fanfare. The Robot crew now wants to help Shane see his vision through, by bringing it to Burning Man 2014 to drive across the earth. This is why we need 
your support.<br/><br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need and Why</h3>
<p>This campaign is to raise $8,500 but in an ideal world we would raise 
$10,000.</p>
<h4>First priority: $3,000
 for drive, steering, brakes and mounting systems to make the base a mobile platform.</h4>
<p>The existing base of the Robot does not accommodate these things, we need to build it
 all. Estimates put that cost around $2,000. Repairs to the skin, 
igniters, and lighting effects are also minor but necessary. These 
repairs will be about $1,000 and will be protected in transport by the 
box truck.</p>
<h4>Second priority: $7,000 for a 16' box truck and gas to drive a 2,000 lb Robot 2,000 miles. <br/>
</h4>
<p>See the photos in our gallery for the transportation we have 
now. You'll see why we need something new.<br/></p> <p></p>Some
 parts of the robot need to be protected during transport so a box truck
 is imperative. We've found a truck we want for $5,000. A box truck will
 also allow the crew to transport essential tools, as well as batteries,
 compressors, and propane tanks for Robot performances. Hauling the 
truck over mountain passes will require around $2,000 in gas.<div>
<div>
<div><div><div><br/></div></div></div>
</div>
</div>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact You Will Make<br/>
</h3> <p>No
 matter how much we raise, your support will help a proven artist propel
 his career to the next level. Burning Man is a festival of 73,000 people
 where the biggest and most complex experiential art exists. By bringing
 the Robot to Burning Man, Shane will have an opportunity to connect with
 like-minded artists and funders who could support his work in the 
future.</p>
<p>The Robot is made from 90% recycled airplane parts. Reusing existing materials in a new way is a key concept in all of Shane's art. At a time when consumption is rising and disposable goods are the way of life, the Robot communicates a very powerful alternate idea. A large venue like Burning Man will help to spread the word that there is value in the things that people discard. Using existing materials also helps to keep costs down.</p>
<p>The Robot crew are all volunteers. We helped build it because we wanted to create something great to share with the world. The power of participation is demonstrated through the formation of the community that has supported the Robot. We want to take it to Burning Man to encourage wider participation in it's existence and show others that big things are possible.</p>
<p>Building the Robot was a dream that was achieved by a leader, his crew and the support of a community. Installing and operating the Robot for the first time at a mountain festival
 in front of 2,000 people was a risk that paid off in huge ways. We made on-site repairs to the 
small glitches we encountered and dealt with very un-level ground 
successfully. All challenges were overcome. The Robot and it's team are proven. Now we want to do more.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The ""What If?""...<br/>
</h3>
</div><div> <p>If we don't raise our ideal goal of $10,000 then we will prioritize funds this way.<br/></p>
<div>1. Build the mobile platform upgrades because Shane's vision is for the Robot to move freely across the ground. Funds will go to this task first and foremost.<br/><br/>2. Transportation
 and gas. It is a huge challenge to find 4+ trucks, drivers and gas
 (think of the waste!) to haul the Robot and all of it's components 2,000 miles for a 7 day 
festival. Our crew has already poured their hearts, souls and money into
 this project and we would love to pay for their gas if the drive 
happens in multiple trucks. A box truck would be ideal because it would 
solve the problem of multiple trucks and gas for each one.<br/><br/>

<p>The Canadian Frame(lines) project seeks to foster learning and 
discussion around the ideas of Canadian cultural identity 
through community engagement and film craft workshops. This project has 
given Canadians across the country a platform to share, in their own 
words and images, the stories that define themselves and our nation. 
We’ve successfully engaged diverse demographics: from the 
young to the old, Canadian-born people, indigenous people, immigrants, 
and anglo- and francophones. We have always sought to maintain a 
bias-free environment where all opinions and views are incorporated into
 a larger and more comprehensive total view of the country’s ideas.</p>
<p>So far, we have worked in 9 seperate communities: Pender Harbour, 
British Columbia; Cremona, Alberta; Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan; St. 
Stephen, New Brunswick; Tignish, Prince Edward Island; Tyendinaga Mohawk
 Territory; Tobermory, Ontario;  Baie Verte, Newfoundland and Seaforth, 
Nova Scotia. We will be working with 3 more communities before the end 
of the year, including Stanbridge East, Quebec; Carman, Manitoba; and one additional First Nations community in British Columbia.<br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here's what people have said about how the Canadian Frame(lines) project has affected their communities:</p>
<p><i>“…I  was moved by the impact Canadian Framelines left on our little community and would welcome them back again to carry on from where they left off. They really did bring our small community together for the month and left behind some friendships and bonding that would not have taken place otherwise. Close to 100 residents attended the premier viewing of the 10 locally produced films.

The Canadian Frame(lines) project seeks to foster learning and 
discussion around the ideas of Canadian cultural identity 
through community engagement and film craft workshops. This project has 
given Canadians across the country a platform to share, in their own 
words and images, the stories that define themselves and our nation. 
We’ve successfully engaged diverse demographics: from the 
young to the old, Canadian-born people, indigenous people, immigrants, 
and anglo- and francophones. We have always sought to maintain a 
bias-free environment where all opinions and views are incorporated into
 a larger and more comprehensive total view of the country’s ideas.
So far, we have worked in 9 seperate communities: Pender Harbour, 
British Columbia; Cremona, Alberta; Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan; St. 
Stephen, New Brunswick; Tignish, Prince Edward Island; Tyendinaga Mohawk
 Territory; Tobermory, Ontario;  Baie Verte, Newfoundland and Seaforth, 
Nova Scotia. We will be working with 3 more communities before the end 
of the year, including Stanbridge East, Quebec; Carman, Manitoba; and one additional First Nations community in British Columbia.
The Impact
Here's what people have said about how the Canadian Frame(lines) project has affected their communities:
“…I  was moved by the impact Canadian Framelines left on our little community and would welcome them back again to carry on from where they left off. They really did bring our small community together for the month and left behind some friendships and bonding that would not have taken place otherwise. Close to 100 residents attended the premier viewing of the 10 locally produced films. It was a very emotional experience for me personally to see the people who would not normally participate get as involved as they did and mix with the younger generation. Since they have left community members are still talking about the experience and what else we could be doing to let the rest of Canada know who we are…” – Gail C.

<p dir=""ltr""><span>                           As Night Ascends the Wolves Awake,</span><span> Oil on canvas 44 x 79 in</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong><strong><br/><br/><br/></strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The Story:</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong><strong><br/><br/></strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>All my life I have been involved with art.  I’d say it’s more love than work.  When I was really young I spontaneously began to draw, and from then on I never stopped creating.  </span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Through the years I grew and developed into an artist.  My mother immersed my brother and I with as many galleries, museums, and overall cultural experiences as possible early in our lives.  This left a lasting mark in my life.  I trained in various art mediums through high school.  After graduating, I set out to develop a really strong portfolio in order to apply and be accepted to some of the major art schools in the nation.  Taking classes part time at a local university, I realized that if I was going to accomplish my degree I would need some financial support.  So I stopped school and started my own industrial pallet recycling company with my brother.  </span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We started it with nothing and eventually built it up to where I was able to return to school full-time with some financial support, get a 4.0 GPA with all my humanities and science courses done, and transfer to a major art institution.  I am now studying Fine Art in Seattle,</span><span> and I am truly blessed.  </span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For years now I have explored different avenues of the painting process, searching for my own unique method to then launch my career into the art world.  After hundreds of paintings and years of experimentation I have found two specific processes that I now want to develop into a master collection of 30-50 paintings.  In doing this I will have a body of work that I can then present to major galleries and collectors to then be represented and grow into a career in the international art world.  I think that with my background in business, and my passion in art, I can be very successful in this endeavor.  I am very driven, and above all else I have had this specific vision that I know can come to fruition with the right amount of hard work and persistence.  </span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So the reason I am launching this indiegogo crowd funding campaign is so that I can have the funds to accomplish this collection of paintings.  Between living cost, tuition, and everything in my life, I won’t have the financial ability to do this immediately.  Even though I am completely ready, trained, and have the goal, I still have this one limitation that I know we as a collective group can overcome.  Materials are just crazy expensive in painting.  So with your help, and everybody pitching in little by little, we can pull together the funds to complete this 2013 collection of paintings. Thanks so much for your support.</span></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong><strong><br/><br/><br/></strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Bio:</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I am an interdisciplinary multimedia artist focusing in video/film, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, digital work, and drawing.  Between sculpture, photography, digital, I have many works and methods in progress.  I recently was named assistant director on a short film here in Seattle, as well as producing and directing my own shorts.  I approach my work crossing many mediums to derive a collective whole.  Right now, I want to create a 2013 collection of paintings.  For years now I’ve been on the hunt for a new and experimental method of painting, and after completing over a hundred or so works in that investigation, I found it.  </span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It has been my vision to execute 30-50 paintings all in large scale.  The reason for the size of the images to be so grand is so the viewer can be encompassed by these somewhat other worlds that are created.  Its is my goal to execute at least 30 so that I can have a large body of work to then be able to present to galleries, collectors, and agencies in order to gain representation, launching my career in the international art world.  In the act of being a successful artist, you have to have a concise method and a deliberate art practice to go forth from.  So in developing this method I have found that definitive style that can then be explored in a series of 30 - 50 paintings.  This is so exciting for me because I am finally ready to step out into the art world with strong, streamlined work that I am passionate about. </span></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong><strong><br/><br/><br/></strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Logistics:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This brings us to the point of why we're here today.  Painting is expensive, bottom line.  It’s gonna take a lot to pull this off, but I feel it can happen.  On top of applying for grant opportunities, I’m launching this indiegogo to fund this campaign.  In order to do this I need very specific materials and that can get pricey.  Oil paint is a very refined product with some smaller tubes starting at ten dollars going up to a hundred or more. The thing is with my process I use a lot of paint, and tubes won’t cut it.  So I have to buy gallons of oil paint, costing around 75.00 a piece.  With a collection this big and dealing with larger scale, this is definitely a necessity.  So in order to have a full spectrum and to be able to develop the work to it’s full potential, I will need around 20-30 different colors in gallon form.  Not to worry.  It all can happen and it can be beautiful.  Other materials are going to include door skin paneling to make canvas supports, 2x2 wood to reinforce the panels, canvas to stretch over the panels so that the canvas won’t warp from the weight of the paint, at least 30 gallons of gesso to coat and seal the canvas from the oil paint, screws and wood glue to attach the wooden panel structures, staples for the canvas, 3 box fans for ventilation, one shop fan, chop saw, skill saw, 2 work tables.  I want to execute starting in July and working through the fall of this year.</span></p>

The Story:

All my life I have been involved with art.  I’d say it’s more love than work.  When I was really young I spontaneously began to draw, and from then on I never stopped creating.  
 
Through the years I grew and developed into an artist.  My mother immersed my brother and I with as many galleries, museums, and overall cultural experiences as possible early in our lives.  This left a lasting mark in my life.  I trained in various art mediums through high school.  After graduating, I set out to develop a really strong portfolio in order to apply and be accepted to some of the major art schools in the nation.  Taking classes part time at a local university, I realized that if I was going to accomplish my degree I would need some financial support.  So I stopped school and started my own industrial pallet recycling company with my brother.  
 
We started it with nothing and eventually built it up to where I was able to return to school full-time with some financial support, get a 4.0 GPA with all my humanities and science courses done, and transfer to a major art institution.  I am now studying Fine Art in Seattle, and I am truly blessed.  
 
For years now I have explored different avenues of the painting process, searching for my own unique method to then launch my career into the art world.  After hundreds of paintings and years of experimentation I have found two specific processes that I now want to develop into a master collection of 30-50 paintings.  In doing this I will have a body of work that I can then present to major galleries and collectors to then be represented and grow into a career in the international art world.  I think that with my background in business, and my passion in art, I can be very successful in this endeavor.  I am very driven, and above all else I have had this specific vision that I know can come to fruition with the right amount of hard work and persistence.  
 
So the reason I am launching this indiegogo crowd funding campaign is so that I can have the funds to accomplish this collection of paintings.  Between living cost, tuition, and everything in my life, I won’t have the financial ability to do this immediately.  Even though I am completely ready, trained, and have the goal, I still have this one limitation that I know we as a collective group can overcome.  Materials are just crazy expensive in painting.  So with your help, and everybody pitching in little by little, we can pull together the funds to complete this 2013 collection of paintings. Thanks so much for your support.

                                    The Lion Lives,  Oil on canvas 60 x 60 inches

Bio:
 
I am an interdisciplinary multimedia artist focusing in video/film, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, digital work, and drawing.  Between sculpture, photography, digital, I have many works and methods in progress.  I recently was named assistant director on a short film here in Seattle, as well as producing and directing my own shorts.  I approach my work crossing many mediums to derive a collective whole.  Right now, I want to create a 2013 collection of paintings.  For years now I’ve been on the hunt for a new and experimental method of painting, and after completing over a hundred or so works in that investigation, I found it.  
 
It has been my vision to execute 30-50 paintings all in large scale.  The reason for the size of the images to be so grand is so the viewer can be encompassed by these somewhat other worlds that are created.  Its is my goal to execute at least 30 so that I can have a large body of work to then be able to present to galleries, collectors, and agencies in order to gain representation, launching my career in the international art world.  In the act of being a successful artist, you have to have a concise method and a deliberate art practice to go forth from.  So in developing this method I have found that definitive style that can then be explored in a series of 30 - 50 paintings.  This is so exciting for me because I am finally ready to step out into the art world with strong, streamlined work that I am passionate about.

Logistics:
 
This brings us to the point of why we're here today.  Painting is expensive, bottom line.  It’s gonna take a lot to pull this off, but I feel it can happen.  On top of applying for grant opportunities, I’m launching this indiegogo to fund this campaign.  In order to do this I need very specific materials and that can get pricey.  Oil paint is a very refined product with some smaller tubes starting at ten dollars going up to a hundred or more. The thing is with my process I use a lot of paint, and tubes won’t cut it.  So I have to buy gallons of oil paint, costing around 75.00 a piece.  With a collection this big and dealing with larger scale, this is definitely a necessity.  So in order to have a full spectrum and to be able to develop the work to it’s full potential, I will need around 20-30 different colors in gallon form.  Not to worry.  It all can happen and it can be beautiful.  Other materials are going to include door skin paneling to make canvas supports, 2x2 wood to reinforce the panels, canvas to stretch over the panels so that the canvas won’t warp from the weight of the paint, at least 30 gallons of gesso to coat and seal the canvas from the oil paint, screws and wood glue to attach the wooden panel structures, staples for the canvas, 3 box fans for ventilation, one shop fan, chop saw, skill saw, 2 work tables.  I want to execute starting in July and working through the fall of this year.

venue for art and performance events, which will host everything from summer

<p align=""justify""><b>The story:</b> In 1860 Henry Burden stood up at his wife's funeral and
announced he would build a church in her honor. Nine years later it was
completed. For over 125 years the church was a central part of the South Troy
neighborhood where it recorded the births, deaths, marriages, trials and
triumphs of the community.</p>

wished to knock it down. The good people of Troy, NY refused to let that
happen. After years of struggle Woodside was returned to the care of the
great-great grandchildren of Henry Burden who were determined that it survive.

over 350 artists from all over the U.S.A. and abroad. A few months ago we
finished up the exterior facade renovation of the church as thousands of stones
were built back up in the gable end walls. You can see some of that work here: <a href=""http://cacwoodside.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://cacwoodside.tumblr.com/</span></a></p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: small;"">My Story</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">I'm a young photographer struggling to get started. I'm currently working a part-time job and going to school part-time as well. I also live in the city which means most of my income go to rent. So not a lot of funds go to my passion, photography. After struggling to to find direction in my life I fell back to something that always seemed to be there, a camera. Now without a doubt I know this is what and who I want to be. I just need a little help to get there. I went back and forth with asking for help, because I'm not one to ask for anything but this is something that will impact my life and my family. This is my dream and any help reaching a part of it would be utterly amazing. <br/></span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: small;"">The Impact</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">My dream is to inspire and make people think when they view my work. If I make someone uncomfortable and question something in themselves or the world then I will feel I've done what I set out to do. Future projects include but are not limited to gender studies, community research through photos, street photography, fashion series, still life and lifestyle. This would impact my life in so many ways and with your help I would be eternally grateful.<br/></span></p>

</div></div>","My Story
I'm a young photographer struggling to get started. I'm currently working a part-time job and going to school part-time as well. I also live in the city which means most of my income go to rent. So not a lot of funds go to my passion, photography. After struggling to to find direction in my life I fell back to something that always seemed to be there, a camera. Now without a doubt I know this is what and who I want to be. I just need a little help to get there. I went back and forth with asking for help, because I'm not one to ask for anything but this is something that will impact my life and my family. This is my dream and any help reaching a part of it would be utterly amazing. 
New goal - $500



The Impact
My dream is to inspire and make people think when they view my work. If I make someone uncomfortable and question something in themselves or the world then I will feel I've done what I set out to do. Future projects include but are not limited to gender studies, community research through photos, street photography, fashion series, still life and lifestyle. This would impact my life in so many ways and with your help I would be eternally grateful.




What I Need 
Every little bit helps and with your kind contribution I will be able to put my plans into motion!


Lighting - monoheads, soft boxes, grids, reflectors, stands etc.
Studio budget - a few shoots done for building my portfolio and projects
Model & make-up artist costs - kit fees, sitting fees etc.
Domain set-up fees & business cards
Possible gallery show!


& What You Get
Due to my limited budget what I can offer is also limited. I hope to give you a feeling of doing something great for a fellow human being! See perks on side-bar for more info!

<p>I am a performer, designer, director and teacher living in Brooklyn.  While most of my training is in acting (Carnegie Mellon BFA, 2000; Yale MFA 2008) I have spent the last four years exploring design, production and performance art.  The Ghost Walk is a manifestation of lost spirits who return to our world in places where they know they will not be seen to engage in ritual acts of remembrance and forgiveness.  We record these rituals in non-traditional space for an unspecified audience and later reveal them as memory through the medium of video art and photography. </p>
<p>The performers create these rituals in rehearsal by filtering personal story through the vocabulary of Butoh and Mystical Imagery.  By returning to the locations from which the costume materials were collected to engage in ceremony, we transform neglected space into a platform for magic and restore forgotten memories to life. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2> <strong>Why we need your help and where is your donation going?</strong>
</h2>
<p>Because the costumes for this piece are made almost completely of collected refuse the baseline budget is very minimal.  97% of the budget goes toward paying cast and crew.  </p>
<h3>If we reach $2,240.00 cast and crew receive a travel stipend! Not bad!</h3>
<h3>If we reach $4,295.00 cast and crew receive a travel stipend AND pay for the day of the shoot!  Even better!</h3>
<h3>If we reach $7,078.00 cast and crew receive a travel stipend, pay for the day of the shoot AND pay for rehearsal!  Hallelujah the world is as it should be!!!</h3>
<p> (Any amount raised over our goal will be distributed by percentage to cast and crew as a bonus.)</p>
<p> Too often in our culture artists are expected to work without pay and I want to do everything in my power to compensate these extraordinary talents for their time and effort.  I am deeply dedicated to taking care of the artists who work with me, from protecting their safety and well-being on set to allowing them the freedom to contribute their creative expression to the overall vision of the piece.  Putting my team on salary is a huge part of that respect and dedication.  With your help I can give them the compensation they deserve! </p>
<h2>Unable to make a donation? You can still help!</h2>
<p>We understand that not everyone will be able to make a monetary contribution to our project.  That's O.K!  If you are interested in what we are doing and would like to support us post a link to this campaign on your Facebook page, send an e-mail, Tweet or post on your blog.  The more people we can reach the better.  Every action counts and we need your help!</p>

Chi perde uno spazio di lavoro perde una casa.
Non può più riposare, pensare, ospitare,

Leggere Strutture Factory è un centro culturale indipendente ubicato in un ex stabile industriale nella città di Bologna.
Alla Factory ti accolgono un caffè vegan, uno spazio di produzione artistica e creativa, una compagnia di danza e un centro di formazione professionale per danzatori, uno sportello di consulenze per l’impresa sociale e culturale, tutto in una modalità di coworking e di scambio di risorse.
La Factory ha pavimenti in legno biocompatibile ed è riscaldata da pannelli solari. Gli arredi sono costruiti da giovani designer o provenienti da percorsi di scambio senza denaro. I materiali di uso comune seguono il principio del recupero e dell’acquisto verde.
La Factory e’ un progetto che parla di nuove economie, che coprogetta e include, che riporta al centro ciò che sta ai margini, che ama le periferie, i confini, che non crede nel denaro come unica risposta, che sceglie il piccolo e sostiene le differenze.
Il suo progetto di Social Business si occupa di riavvio di competenze, nuove povertà, persone fuoriuscite dal mercato del lavoro. Inventa nuovi percorsi per la sostenibilità, si mette alla prova.
La Factory non possiede nulla, ha solo ciò che serve. 

 
La Factory in 5 anni di attività ha dato lavoro a più di 100 persone. 
Ha rappresentato un punto di riferimento per attività culturali, artistiche, ha formato e inserito in compagnie di danza nazionali e internazionali quasi 50 giovani danzatori, ha sostenuto percorsi di reintegrazione sociale e lavorativa, ha realizzato progetti, ha inventato nuovi modi di lavorare, ha fatto incontrare persone, idee, esperienze, ha costruito e disfatto, ricomposto e reinventato, si è persa e si è ritrovata.
Ha accolto. Ha regalato. Ha preso posizioni.
Si è presa tutta la responsabilità.
 

 
Dal 2009:


ha riconvertito in centro creativo un magazzino chiuso da anni, sostenendone le spese di ristrutturazione, di adeguamento locali, di cambio di destinazione d’uso con un investimento privato di oltre 200.000 euro e la stipula di un mutuo ventennale;


ha attivato un percorso di coworking ospitando altri professionisti all’interno della struttura;


ha aperto un spazio bar riallestendo il piano terra dello stabile. 


Dal 2012:


ha richiesto una riduzione del canone di locazione. Riduzione non concessa;


ha subito un aumento del canone di locazione per l’utilizzo di due posti auto di cui non usufruisce. Non è stata possibile alcuna negoziazione.


a seguito della modifica delle norme antincendio per i locali di pubblico spettacolo ha dovuto sospendere parte delle attività che potranno riprendere solo una volta effettuate le modifiche strutturali necessarie all’adeguamento normativo.
 

NON RIUSCIAMO A FAR FRONTE A TUTTE LE SPESE. 
NON POSSIAMO PIÙ LAVORARE. 
 
Quali soluzioni? 


Un progetto di azionariato popolare per il sostegno economico del percorso intrapreso.


Un piano di ristrutturazione aziendale aperto e partecipato in cui convergano:



 progetti di sostegno alla programmazione;


collaborazioni volontarie;


azioni di coprogettazione.

IS THE FACTORY GOING TO CLOSE?

WE MADE THE FACTORY. 
WHAT CAN YOU ADD?
 
We have got 2 months.
Who loses his place of work looses his home.
He can’t rest, he can’t think, he can’t host, he can’t imagine.
 
Leggere Strutture Factory is an independent cultural centre sited in an ex industrial building in Bologna. At the Factory you can find a vegan cafè, a space for artistic and creative production, a dance company and a training centre for dancers, a counselling service for social and cultural enterprise. All the activities are conducted in a co-working and shared way. The Factory has eco-friendly wood flooring and it is heated by solar panels. The whole furniture is made by young designers or obtained through exchange and other forms of non-monetary trade, conforming to a general eco-friendly policies. The Factory project is also focused on new economies: it does not conceive money as the only answer, it includes and brings back to the centre what is at the margins, it privileges what is small and works among boundaries and differences. The Factory runs a Social Business project that is focused on restarting skills, new poverties and unemployed people. It invents new ways of sustainability and it puts itself to the test. 
The Factory owes nothing and possesses only the necessary. 
 
In five years of activity, the Factory has given a job to more than 100 people.
 It has become a datum point for cultural and artistic activities, it has trained almost 50 dancers and it has found for them a job in important national and international dance companies. It has supported social reintegration and employment restatement paths, it has carried out projects, it has invented new methods of work, it has brought together people, ideas and experiences. It has built and destroyed, reinvented and rebuilt. It has got lost and then it has found the way. It has received and given, it has taken a stand, as well as it has taken the whole responsibility.

 
Since 2009:


The Factory has transformed a closed warehouse into a creative centre, bearing the costs of reconstruction, of structural adaptation and bureaucratic expenses through a private investment of 200.000 euros and a twenty-year loan;


It has started a co-working process, hosting other professionals inside the building;


It has opened a bar at the ground floor.

  
Since 2012:


The Factory has called for a reduction in rent, which has not been granted;


There has been an increase of rent for the use of a parking which we do not use. There was no possible negotiation;


Due to a modification of the standard fire for places of public entertainment, the Factory had to suspend some of its activities, which can restart only after an adaptation to the standards.

We can’t bear such expenses. 
We can’t go on working.
 
What solutions? 


A popular shareholding for sustaining the project developed until now.


An open and participated corporate restructuring which could put together:  



projects for planning activities;


voluntary collaborations;
co-projecting activities.
 
WE HAVE WORKED AND STILL WORK:
For a shared place
We do co-working and promote new projects, organize residences for artists, host workshops and interdisciplinary collaborations.
For a shared responsibility
We co-project, trying to involve the local community, we believe in sharing ideas and skills in order to develop new job opportunities.
For new job opportunities and skill restarting
We indicate opportunities and realize training courses for young dancers, trying to facilitate their placement in national and international dance companies. We realize workshops on enterprise creation for unemployed and disadvantaged people, we are involved in a project on urban fragilities and we have created a counselling service for social business projects.
For a project accessible to all
We realize training courses for free and support projects on social inclusion and disability, we also work on the activation of bursary works for disadvantaged people.
For exchange trading
We organize exchange activities and support non-monetary economies, planning and projecting events in which money is not the only resource.
 
WE MADE ALL THESE THINGS

<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""font-size: medium; font-family: Candara, sans-serif; color: #333333;"">My project's goal is to tell twenty-one stories of “Changing Women” in form of art portraits. Women from different backgrounds, that have struggled for acceptance and equality in the contemporary model of society. By portraying women that, against all odds, have found their inner strength and thrived, I hope to enhance their power and make of them models and a voice for all women that have struggled with the challenges to be themselves and embrace their own choices. I want these stories to inspire and empower other women in seeking for their own path, and to raise awareness of how it is like to be a woman in today's world. I want to transform these women in modern muses, enhancing their real beauty in form of works of art.</span></p>

If everything goes as planned, all the portraits might be completed around <strong>April/May 2014. </strong>After that, I will be starting the design part of my work, preparing files for print and perks, designing the book, etc. I will be also sending the works for framing, support the edition of the video, planning the art show, and a myriad of other tasks. My plan is to deliver everything by the Harvest season, or the Autumn Equinox - around <strong>October 2012. </strong>Before<strong> December 2014, </strong>to close the year with a feeling of mission accomplished,<strong> </strong>I hope to have all the works hanging on a gallery wall, the perks shipped, and a check to give to the women's support organization we will help.<br/><br/></span></span></span></p>

<p> </p></div>","HELLO.My name is Patricia Ariel, and I am an artist and illustrator.
I have created images that have been licensed in several products and published and collected all over the world.


 
To me, creating art is a way to
INSPIRE
CONSCIENTIZEandPROMOTE CHANGES
and I want to use my skills and creativity to help shaping a better WORLD for all.
 
One of the most gratifying parts of my work is the making of portraits. It is so fascinating to decode the emotions brought out by the human face, their uniqueness, their stories. The process of creating a portrait can be very revealing. Through the lens of art, we end up seeing ourselves with different eyes, and finding out strengths - both physical and spiritual – we could never suspect we had.
 
 


 
And it was thinking about this unique empowerment and clarity that Art is able to bring, that I have designed a project that would help empower and inspire women to seek for their unique light and value – the one that lies beyond their physical look. 
 
 
THE PROJECT.
The “Changing Woman” is a myth of the` Navajo people, and represents the personification of the Earth, the seasons, and the cycles of life. Nothing more appropriate to represent our strengths, our nurturing nature, but also our huge capacity to change ourselves and the world around us.

 
 
My project's goal is to tell twenty-one stories of “Changing Women” in form of art portraits. Women from different backgrounds, that have struggled for acceptance and equality in the contemporary model of society. By portraying women that, against all odds, have found their inner strength and thrived, I hope to enhance their power and make of them models and a voice for all women that have struggled with the challenges to be themselves and embrace their own choices. I want these stories to inspire and empower other women in seeking for their own path, and to raise awareness of how it is like to be a woman in today's world. I want to transform these women in modern muses, enhancing their real beauty in form of works of art.
 
The portraits will be exhibited in an art show and featured in a book, along with the stories and photos of the women who inspired them. There will also be a production of limited edition prints and possibly other merchandise products. A “behind the scene” video of the project will be produced. All the proceeds from the sales of prints and merchandise, will support an organization pro women's rights or a shelter. 
 
 
YOUR SUPPORT WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE.
To make this project possible, and help changing lives, minds, and hearts, I need your help. I have estimated a minimum of $29,000 to make it happen according to my vision. With your support it will be possible...
… to purchase quality art materials for the production and presentation of twenty-one works of art.
… to purchase electronic equipment and services that will produce quality graphic results for deliverables like prints and books.
… to cover expenses with art show preparation and reception, professional scanning, framing, promotion, video edition, and miscellaneous services like packing, shipping, and others.
… to cover the artist's hours so she can fully focus on giving her best. :)
… to cover runs of postcards, books, prints, and t-shirts, destined to reward backers.
… to cover the first runs of prints which sales will be destined to support our organization of choice.
I can find alternatives to keep  the project alive even without reaching my campaign goal, and this is why I have decided to opt for ""Flexible funding"". There will be, however, a bit more struggle, more time required until the completion,  and less resources, which  might force me to reduce the potential of all that the project could become.
 
THE TIMEFRAMES.The project is scheduled to start on July 2013, when I will be doing my first studies on how the portraits will be conceptualized, the techniques, the execution, etc. I am planning to complete at least two portraits a month, but art is not an exact science and this can also vary. If everything goes as planned, all the portraits might be completed around April/May 2014. After that, I will be starting the design part of my work, preparing files for print and perks, designing the book, etc. I will be also sending the works for framing, support the edition of the video, planning the art show, and a myriad of other tasks. My plan is to deliver everything by the Harvest season, or the Autumn Equinox - around October 2012. Before December 2014, to close the year with a feeling of mission accomplished, I hope to have all the works hanging on a gallery wall, the perks shipped, and a check to give to the women's support organization we will help.
Notice that this is a projection made for a fully funded campaign. This timeframe can change depending on how much funding I will be able to raise, which will be a decisive factor on time and resources availability.
 
 
WHAT YOU WILL GET.
Along with recognition and acknowledgment for your generous support, your kindness will be rewarded with items specially created for this project. That includes:

 exclusive postcards, t-shirts, posters, and art zines (all created only for the Indie Gogo backers!)
 electronic and hard copies of the Changing Woman art book. 
Contributions of $200 or more will win original artworks, including custom art portraits of a woman of your life. 
Contributions of $3,000 will take home one of the Changing Woman original artworks.
All backers from the Hummingbird to the Dragonfly sponsorships will have their names in a  drawing (per sponsorship category) that will give them a chance to win one of the limited edition art prints released by the project.
All backers will have premier online access to the Changing Woman behind the scenes video.

 
And, as I love to give away cool stuff with my art,  I will also be giving surprise gifts to my backers along the way, no matter how much they have contributed with! So, expect to have the chance to win prints and other goodies, and even original artworks, as the project progresses! 
 UPDATE: First Surprise Perk!!4.5″ × 6.5″ high quality journal featuring my painting “Witness” + my original 5″ × 7″ mix media painting “Natura #2”, matted and ready to frame. All the backers names will enter a drawing at the end of the campaign and one of them will take both items home by mid June. Yep, you won't need to wait until the project is completed to start receiving your perks!

 
THE CHANGE WE NEED.
 We all know that, in spite of the many efforts towards abolishing inequality, there are still a lot to be done. Women still suffer discrimination in their communities and workplaces; the numbers of genre violence such as abuse, sexual harassment, rape, and domestic violence, are still astonishing; not mentioning that, in many countries, social exclusion, trafficking, restricted mobility, “honor” killings, genital mutilation, and other horrors, are still part of the reality of thousands of women. 
To change this scenario, more than never, we need open eyes. We need inspiration, we need examples, we need role models. Real women, with real lives, and how they changed them and their reality. 
 
I want to show through real stories and inspiring art that yes, it is possible to thrive and live our dreams and choices in a world that is still far from fairness, but that it is possible to be changed, and it is, every day, through the lives of powerful and brave women. I want to show that we all can be the change, and inspire others.
 
 
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP.
If for some reason you are not able to help with funding, there are other ways you can support the project.
 

You can simply share the campaign on your Facebook, Twitter, Google+, or other social network.

<p>Who would have thunk, but I suppose this whole idea here came into supposing sometime late this past winter one afternoon at the kitchen table in the home of my friend, a music-maker. I had never liked the idea of prints and having not touched the <em>thing</em> that someone has in their hands.  He said that he would never sell the master recording of one of his albums, but he would make available the albums.

<h3>Abraham Danso‘s dream is to touch peoples emotions and souls with his creations &amp; paintings.</h3>
<br/>YOUR SUPPORT FOR HIS FIRST EXHIBITION AT THE AGORA ART GALLERY IN NEW YORK WILL BRING HIM ONE STEP CLOSER.<br/><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p><i><br/>"" I am looking to spread new tone-elements with the power of the spirit.""</i><b><br/></b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b><br/>In more concrete terms</b> - in the creation and painting of abstract expressionism, the dissolution of the visual shapes on the one hand while making energies and vibration visible on the other hand is primary. This alouds me, my dream to touch peoples emotions and souls with my artistic works and inspirate them. I have already accepted to participate in this prestigious Art Gallery<i>.<br/></i></p>
<p><i>"" but I need your help to cover the costs of this Art Gallery Exhibition Project "".</i> <br/></p>
<p><br/><b>The Agora Art Gallery in New York</b> is a international renowned contemporary Art Gallery. With a audience of over 40‘000 art interested viewers and colectors, my art style will be able to make an impact on society. The Gallery is also the publisher of the ARTis-Spectrum Artmagazin in New York.</p>
<p><i>""The pieces i create are meant to touch and stimulate the viewers visually and mentally. This is done through the vibrant color combination and composition and the subject matter expands upon concepts of self-awerness, personal enhancement and hidden massages about the universe and the humans in it.""</i><br/></p>
<p><i>"" My dream is to make life a better place through art and the joy of creativity. ""</i><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<br/>Creative Process</h3>
<p>This is an introduction to the unique style of art called <b>“ spiritually free creation with color material “</b>. The mixture of abstract expressionism deeply spiritually infused, mixed with many other color design technologycal technics and other classical and modern art influences. By way of my senses, the various materials and textures, colors and implements I try to experiment and break with the known norms.<i><br/></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<b>Below:</b> A SLICE of the finished work ""3 Ytilibissop"" on canvas 47.3' x 63' inch<br/>               mixed media with tiny inclusions of phosphorus fluorescent pigment. <br/><br/><p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/953056/files/20141023004744-slice-of__3_Ytilibissop_.jpg?1414050464"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>""This enables me to create with the color materials not only on the pictorial surface.</i> <i>Through the actual work with painting media-shape illustration I am led back to the color material dissolution of shape and therefore arrive at the core essence of the original movement that arose to the surface.</i>""<br/><br/><h3>
<br/>About the Artist</h3>
<p>Abraham Danso is born in <b>London, UK</b>, from there he moved in the infancy over <br/><b>The Gambia / West Africa</b> in to <b>Zurich, Switzerland</b>. <br/></p>
<p>In the course of his life he visited the occupational school for bricklayers and educated further to himself with the main focus Interior design/decoration at the new art school of Zurich. Then he learnt the occupation to the dipl. painter/ decorator by Christian Schmidt in Zurich, a specialist in dealing and handling with material, form and color. <br/></p>
<p>Fascinated by this craft tradition and artistic technologies he further specialised in this area and worked during the next years as a painter/decorator among other things on the Opera House Zurich. The advancement in the areas of Decoration painting, Space and object creation was deepened. <br/></p>
<p>To allow more dimension to his activities he studied for the dipl. colour designer / creator HF/TS (prof. BEng. Color Design Technology). Abraham develops in the areas of the humanities, visual art, space and object design, and investigates the energetic effect from colors and materials. <br/><br/><i>With pleasure he would introduce himself in schools and programmes for 
children and youngsters to give an understanding of the most different 
creation possibilities of constructive creativity to them.</i></p>
<p><br/>- Special Thanks to Mel, Zion, Nael and Tino for the amazing mental support.<br/></p>

Abraham Danso‘s dream is to touch peoples emotions and souls with his creations & paintings.
YOUR SUPPORT FOR HIS FIRST EXHIBITION AT THE AGORA ART GALLERY IN NEW YORK WILL BRING HIM ONE STEP CLOSER.
The Goal
"" I am looking to spread new tone-elements with the power of the spirit.""

In more concrete terms - in the creation and painting of abstract expressionism, the dissolution of the visual shapes on the one hand while making energies and vibration visible on the other hand is primary. This alouds me, my dream to touch peoples emotions and souls with my artistic works and inspirate them. I have already accepted to participate in this prestigious Art Gallery.
"" but I need your help to cover the costs of this Art Gallery Exhibition Project "". 
The Agora Art Gallery in New York is a international renowned contemporary Art Gallery. With a audience of over 40‘000 art interested viewers and colectors, my art style will be able to make an impact on society. The Gallery is also the publisher of the ARTis-Spectrum Artmagazin in New York.
""The pieces i create are meant to touch and stimulate the viewers visually and mentally. This is done through the vibrant color combination and composition and the subject matter expands upon concepts of self-awerness, personal enhancement and hidden massages about the universe and the humans in it.""
"" My dream is to make life a better place through art and the joy of creativity. ""


Creative Process
This is an introduction to the unique style of art called “ spiritually free creation with color material “. The mixture of abstract expressionism deeply spiritually infused, mixed with many other color design technologycal technics and other classical and modern art influences. By way of my senses, the various materials and textures, colors and implements I try to experiment and break with the known norms.

Below: A SLICE of the finished work ""3 Ytilibissop"" on canvas 47.3' x 63' inch               mixed media with tiny inclusions of phosphorus fluorescent pigment.      
""This enables me to create with the color materials not only on the pictorial surface. Through the actual work with painting media-shape illustration I am led back to the color material dissolution of shape and therefore arrive at the core essence of the original movement that arose to the surface.""
About the Artist
Abraham Danso is born in London, UK, from there he moved in the infancy over The Gambia / West Africa in to Zurich, Switzerland. 
In the course of his life he visited the occupational school for bricklayers and educated further to himself with the main focus Interior design/decoration at the new art school of Zurich. Then he learnt the occupation to the dipl. painter/ decorator by Christian Schmidt in Zurich, a specialist in dealing and handling with material, form and color. 
Fascinated by this craft tradition and artistic technologies he further specialised in this area and worked during the next years as a painter/decorator among other things on the Opera House Zurich. The advancement in the areas of Decoration painting, Space and object creation was deepened. 
To allow more dimension to his activities he studied for the dipl. colour designer / creator HF/TS (prof. BEng. Color Design Technology). Abraham develops in the areas of the humanities, visual art, space and object design, and investigates the energetic effect from colors and materials. With pleasure he would introduce himself in schools and programmes for 
children and youngsters to give an understanding of the most different 
creation possibilities of constructive creativity to them.
- Special Thanks to Mel, Zion, Nael and Tino for the amazing mental support.

Abraham Danso‘s Traum ist mit Kreation & Bild die Emotionen und Seelen der 
Menschen zu berühren.
IHRE UNTERSTÜTZUNG FÜR SEINE ERSTE AUSSTELLUNG IN DER AGORA KUNST GALERIE IN NEW YORK BRINGT IHM SEINEN TRAUM EIN STÜCK NÄHER.
Das Ziel
""Ich
 bemühe mich mit geistiger Kraft für die Verbreitung neuer Klang-Werte.""Konkret - bei meiner Art der Gestaltung und Malerei von abstraktem Expressionismus, ist die Auflösung der visuellen Formen und das sichtbar
 machen von Energien und deren Vibrationen primär. Dies ermöglicht mir 
meinen Traum andere Mitmenschen durch meine künstlerische Art zu 
berühren und zu inspieriren. Ich habe bereits die Anerkennung und 
Einladung der repräsentativen Agora Art Gallery bekommen.""aber ich 
brauche Eure Hilfe um die Kosten für dieses Agora Art Gallery Austellungs -Projekt zu 
decken "". Die Agora Art Gallery ist eine weltbekannte und zeitgenössische 
Kunst-Galerie. Mit einem Kundenstamm von über 40‘000 
Interessenten, Sammlern und Käufern hat meine Kunst die Möglichkeit 
einem breiten Publikum präsentiert zu werden. Die Galerie ist auch der 
Herausgeber des ARTis-Spectrum Kunstmagazin in New York. ""Mit den Bildern die ich kreiere, der Spiegelung und Kraft des geistigen 
sowie über die Kombination, Komposition und Reflexion von 
Farbmaterialklängen möchte ich durch Vibrationen neue Klang-Werte 
schaffen und andere Mitmenschen visuell und emotional stimulieren, berühren. Diese Art von Kommunikation möchte ich mit anderen teilen und
 versuche dabei deren Emotionen zu wecken."" ""Die Bildimformationen dehnen 
sich dem Betrachter subijektiv aus, verknüpfen sich mit dem Betrachter,
 seiner
 Wahrnemung, -Selbsterfahrung und persönlichen Weiterentwicklung, dabei 
transportieren sie versteckte Botschaften des Universum und schwingen 
mit 
dem Innenleben das Menschen in sich haben."""" Mein Traum ist es, durch die Kreativität und Kunst den Menschen Freude 
im Leben zu bereiten. ""
Kreativ-ProzessIch
 nenne meinen Kunststyl “ Geistige freie Gestaltung mit Farben-Material 
“. Der Mix von abstraktem Expressionismus verflochten mit geistigem 
Schaffen, gemischt mit vielen anderen Gestaltungs- Maltechniken, 
klassischen und modernen Einflüssen. Mittels meinen Sinnen, den 
Farben-Materialien und Transportmitteln experimentieren und bekannte 
Normen aufbrechen. Unten: Erste künstlerische Arbeit nach meiner Schulter Operation im März 2014                      ""Noitarebil"" mix media auf Leinwand 33.5' x 59' inch /85 x 120 cm Aug. 14
      
""Dies ermöglicht mir mit den Farbmaterialien nicht nur
 auf der Bildoberfläche zu schaffen. Über die Arbeit der 
eigentlichen Farbmaterial-Formdarstellung wieder zurück zur 
farbmateriellen Formauflösung, dem eigentlichen und Wesentlichen.""Über den Künstler
Abraham
 Danso ist in London, UK geboren, von dort aus er im Kindesalter über The Gambia / West Afrika in die Schweiz nach Zürich übersiedelte. Im Laufe seines Lebens 
besuchte er die Berufschule für Maurer und bildete sich mit dem 
Schwerpunkt Innenarchitektur an der Neuen Kunst Schule Zürich weiter. 
Danach erlernte er den Beruf zum dipl. Maler/Dekorationsmaler bei 
Christian Schmidt in Zürich, einem Spezialisten im Umgang mit Material,
 Form und Farbe. Fasziniert von dieser Handwerkstradition und den 
künstlerischen Techniken spezialisierte er sich weiter auf diesem 
Gebiet und arbeitete in den darauffolgenden Jahren als Maler/Dekorationsmaler u.a. am Opern Haus Zürich. Um seinem Tun mehr Dimension zu ermöglichen bildete er sich zum diplomierten Farbdesigner/Gestalter HF/TS (prof. B Eng. Color Design Technology) aus. Abraham entfaltet sich auf den Gebieten der Geisteswissenschaften, visuellen Kunst, Raum-und Objektgestaltung, und erforscht die energetische Wirkung von Farben-Material. Gerne würde er sich in Schulen und Programmen für Kinder und Jugendliche einbringen, um Ihnen dieverschiedensten Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten von konstruktiver kreativität näher zu bringen.

- Besonderen Dank an Mel, Zion, Nael und Tino für die erstaunliche mentale Unterstützung.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In order to learn from the mistakes of nations before us it is imperative to view the current deficit as an opportunity and not a stagnant:</p>
<p>Benjamin Bugs is an underground rap artist with 21 years in the ent. field.</p>
<p>Personally experiencing power struggles along with strenuous workloads in the corporate world to cut costs and witnessing irrelevant excessive spending amongst low income individuals gave me insight on how to bring balance to the economy when factoring in higher education. </p>
<p>Contributors to the ""Lowering campaign"" will expand the focused voice of conflict resolution to world groups who may not sufficiently receive the current collective message from political leaders because of how it is conveyed. At the same time elite groups can hear it and get a better understanding of what approaches can be used to support and finance the unemployed and dependent based on behavioral statistics and how it correlates with disadvantage rather than failed existing market strategies that cause large deficits. Subsidized incentives should be only given to programs that are competent.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>$4,194 is needed (perks included) for a soundcloud solo account ($103.85), a LinkedIn business account ($239.40) and a Facebook ad ($1,850) [all accounts are annual]. These accounts will be used to expand my networks in the music, social and business forums giving the project more prestige. This particular project is not-for-profit so you will not receive a return on investment unless you participate in one of the perks offered; however, you will be an investor in all pervading intellectual accomplishments from the project which hopefully ignites economized action.</p>
<p>Benjamin Bugs stands firm on the decision to  NOT sign deals with major music labels in the existing market to ensure there will be no misrepresentation or dilution of content.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<p>This project is being projected on a widescale from my point of view in order  to make myself one with the world. In my travels I learned people don't value advice as much as they value opinions so this LP is my opinion. I am aware some may disagree with what I say so I put formal research behind it along with my experience. The addition of accredited education gives ""Nerdcore Hiphop"" more exposure with the hope of gaining attention of aspiring students and people interested in education.</p>
<p>I have a history of performing on cards with the greatest hip hop artists as well as having audio placements on television and movies when I was working with mainstream; however, this is my solo effort combining business and art to address actual world issues proactively. Basically the money is not as important as the results. The results will determine how and if I will pursue  my career independently. </p>
<p>Contributing may not be something you can do which I understand completely. The click of a play button just to hear the material is greatly appreciated. If you value it then by all means using the share option on my page along with indiegogo tools will gain the attention of someone else. Tweet the link to your favorite song amongst your associates or in forums where you feel it would be of help. All interaction are factors that can be used for  financial projections and viable when financing future endeavors.

Now, in the final hours, I just need to get another $240 and I’ve got enough for the biggie 9×9 square. And remember: this money goes to <a href=""http://www.youthinarts.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Youth in Arts</a>  and arts education. Thanks for you interest and support!</p>
<hr/><p>The annual Street Painting Festival in San Rafael is a benefit for Youth in Arts, a wonderful organization that is struggling to pick up some of the arts education slack left by dwindling budgets.</p>
<p>This year the festival theme is Bella Terra (or Beautiful Earth) and my take on it is mildly satiric, pro-environmental, and rather anti-development (it also tastes a bit steampunk but I don’t think that’s at issue). I sent my submission in and after a brief and very friendly email correspondence the folks from Youth in Arts said that they would be happy to admit my piece but they think it’s too controversial for them to find a sponsor.</p>
<p>So here I am.</p>
<p>Give a couple bucks if you can. Any extra money raised above and beyond the sponsorship cost (and perhaps a few bucks for me to buy extra chalk) will be donated evenly between Youth in Arts and the Marin Open Space District.</p>
<p>So let folks know that street painting can and should be more than just ephemeral decorations, help me get my work on the ground, and donate to two very worthy causes.</p>
<p>Whether you are able to contribute or not come by and see me at the festival on June 12th and 13th!</p>

I sent my submission in and after a brief and very friendly email correspondence the folks from Youth in Arts said that they would be happy to admit my piece but they think it’s too controversial for them to find a sponsor.
So here I am.
Give a couple bucks if you can. Any extra money raised above and beyond the sponsorship cost (and perhaps a few bucks for me to buy extra chalk) will be donated evenly between Youth in Arts and the Marin Open Space District.
So let folks know that street painting can and should be more than just ephemeral decorations, help me get my work on the ground, and donate to two very worthy causes.
Whether you are able to contribute or not come by and see me at the festival on June 12th and 13th!

<p><span><strong>Who is Marjoni McBride?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I’ve been painting and drawing since I was a young child. Art has always been my passion. The path that life has chosen for me has been a difficult one. Moving to Atlanta, GA from New Jersey at the young age of 19, I didn’t get a chance to continue my college education until I turned 25. My financial struggles began two years ago when I had the honor to donate my kidney to my wonderful grandmother. And ever since then I had to pay out of pocket to pay for tuition. I have used all of my savings and funds to get this far. I’m currently picked up a second job to try to stay afloat, but it will not be enough for me to pay for school.</span></p>
<p><span>However, I’m now almost done!!!!! I have 3 classes until I graduate. </span></p>
<p><span>I’m currently studying Biology and Fine Arts. I choose this as a major, because I want to become a Medical Illustrator. I know most of you are like “What is that?” Well, a medical illustrator would provide any medical related drawings, animations, and/or graphics to doctors, publishing, or pharmaceutical companies. Yes, I have to take pre-med courses (good luck to me) LOL. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>How can you help…</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I’m asking all of my friends, family, acquaintances, and friends of friends to help me on my educational journey. I know that times are hard but anything that you can give would help me. I’m seeking a total donation of $4,500; which will pay for tuition and books and graduation fees. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>What’s in it for you? </strong></span></p>
<p><span>As a token of my appreciation, I have in line some awesome perks for those who decide to donate. </span></p>

<p><span>You will receive a thank you post card of one of my paintings. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>$25 -$49</strong></span></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I'm that quirky artist that you've all met at least once in your life.  I have an odd disposition and dress like noone notices my socks don't match.  As an artist I feel I have the right to be odd, almost like its expected.  I decided to go to school to get educated in the arts, but its kinda....eh. Painting disciplines mainly cover Europe, but I know there's some pretty dope art in other cultures.  Its out there, I've seen it!  I wanna experience it.  I have the fantastic opportunity to study abroad for this summer in 17 different countries and next academic year in Cape Town, South Africa.  The end of journey will culminate into a phoetic poetography book or art, photography, and creative writing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ok this is serious!  The world will begin to cave in on itself as the crust crumbles and the magma center boils over like a cherry pie gone wrong.  Don't worry, I can save us all by studying art abroad.  The information the Chinese and South Africans along with my American training will give me the necessary paintbrush techniques to journey to the center of the earth and turn off the oven.  You're Welcome.  Then, when I get back I will have established contacts with multiple countries and South Africans, and the weird creatures upon my journey to begin a cultural arts exchange program for middle to high school students for summer camps.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm just gonna put it out there.  I need 12 Gs.  The summer programs costs $4500 and the plane ticket costs $1500.  My schooling in South Africa is funded by grants (yayy government!), but the plane tickets for the three mini-me's and my better half aren't.  Their coming to South Africa for the year, because I fear for their nutritional health.  French Fries is not a meal!  That's $7500 for plane tickets alone ( I think.  I do brushstrokes not key strokes).  For your kind and generous support, I am whipping out mini portraits.  These are 3X2 inches of charcoal fun.</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The more people know about the dangers of world destruction, the more funds I may get to save us all.  Spread the word and be the sidekick...I mean Hero Support!</p>

Allan Carrasco, two stars of the miniatures scene, are teaming up again to produce Moloch, the tallest Figone miniature ever! This is your chance to help bring this
ambitious project to life.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442842403/bxp96i06wqaymbyg5zjz.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 643.902px; height: 88px;""/></p>As aficionados of his work can attest,
monsters and orcs are Allan’s specialities. <br/>He first gave our brushes a massive mounted orc. Giants, by their proportions, are monsters which allows him to show his ability to give life to impressive miniatures.<p>FIGONE is a French miniatures company
founded by Jérémie in 2009 and dedicated to producing and selling high quality
figures for collectors, sculptors and painters. <strong>FIGONE</strong> has
what it takes to make a finished sculpt commercially available.</p>
<p>With Indiegogo and your help to fund
this huge, highly anticipated project, Rocco was born.

</p><p>Moloch will be the tallest miniature
ever produced by <strong><span>FIGONE</span></strong> and the one of the largest ever sculpted by Allan Carrasco.</p><p><br/></p>

and these drawings have served as inspiration rather than a concrete blueprint.
He followed them closely but added more details here and there, e.g.
a larger claymore, various ornaments, slight changes on the position (back for instance).<br/><br/>As part of this campaign, Romain Van den Bogaert sculpted a new funny bust: Flap.<div>Straight from Jérémie and Romain's imagination, this bucolic character opens a very wide interpretation panel which should appeal to  artists and collectors.</div><div>

<p>""It is said that Trollus

 their heads. What's more, if they can not find something, they bludgeon

finish on beginning of november.<br/>
Allan Carrasco has started sculpting the miniature, so that we'll be able to start casting minis as soon as the main goal is reached.<br/>
The resin miniature will normally be available in december

<p>Regular updates with WIP shots to all
contributors …</p>

<p>The creation
of a miniature of this scale requires a lot of investment in terms of time and
resources. The team members make their living from painting and sculpting so a
certain degree of profitability needs to be assured before they can commit to the
project.</p>
<p>The funding we
hope to gain will cover the sculpting, molding, casting, packaging and release
of Moloch, Flap as well as future stretch goals and as a thank you for your support, offer the model at a discount
price for contributors.</p>
<p>So if you want
to have your own copy of this marvelous miniature or if you just want to help
Moloch see the light of day, now is the time to contribute. A range of perks are
proposed below to encourage those who would like to help make this project a
success.</p>

« What we stood upon, is not just the land of our ancestors. It is the very body of our all-father. »After Rocco, Jérémie Bonamant Teboul and
Allan Carrasco, two stars of the miniatures scene, are teaming up again to produce Moloch, the tallest Figone miniature ever! This is your chance to help bring this
ambitious project to life.
As aficionados of his work can attest,
monsters and orcs are Allan’s specialities. He first gave our brushes a massive mounted orc. Giants, by their proportions, are monsters which allows him to show his ability to give life to impressive miniatures.FIGONE is a French miniatures company
founded by Jérémie in 2009 and dedicated to producing and selling high quality
figures for collectors, sculptors and painters. FIGONE has
what it takes to make a finished sculpt commercially available.
With Indiegogo and your help to fund
this huge, highly anticipated project, Rocco was born.

Moloch will be the tallest miniature
ever produced by FIGONE and the one of the largest ever sculpted by Allan Carrasco.

Moloch will be a large 54mm
scale miniature cast in high quality resin, the tallest ever in Figone 170mm!!!! Here you'll see the final miniature, along with the final concept by artist
Bertrand Benoit.Don’t forget that Allan is an artist
and these drawings have served as inspiration rather than a concrete blueprint.
He followed them closely but added more details here and there, e.g.
a larger claymore, various ornaments, slight changes on the position (back for instance).As part of this campaign, Romain Van den Bogaert sculpted a new funny bust: Flap.Straight from Jérémie and Romain's imagination, this bucolic character opens a very wide interpretation panel which should appeal to  artists and collectors.

""It is said that Trollus 
vulgaris, in order to fertilise their mushrooms, splash living beings on
 their heads. What's more, if they can not find something, they bludgeon
 themselves to bleed.- Woaw...THAT explains a lot of things.""

The Indigogo campaign will
finish on beginning of november.
Allan Carrasco has started sculpting the miniature, so that we'll be able to start casting minis as soon as the main goal is reached.
The resin miniature will normally be available in december

Regular updates with WIP shots to all
contributors …


The creation
of a miniature of this scale requires a lot of investment in terms of time and
resources. The team members make their living from painting and sculpting so a
certain degree of profitability needs to be assured before they can commit to the
project.
The funding we
hope to gain will cover the sculpting, molding, casting, packaging and release
of Moloch, Flap as well as future stretch goals and as a thank you for your support, offer the model at a discount
price for contributors.
So if you want
to have your own copy of this marvelous miniature or if you just want to help
Moloch see the light of day, now is the time to contribute. A range of perks are
proposed below to encourage those who would like to help make this project a
success.






IMPORTANT NOTICE: We have a few black shirt left of Figopedia's campaign. For this campaign, we have decided to print a white shirt. 
If you prefer a black version, please send us an email as soon as you have ordered your perk, we'll tell you if there are left in your size.




PLEASE NOTE THAT SHIPPING WORLDWIDE IS INCLUDED IN FOR ALL THE PERKS!

We have planned a couple of stretch goals if the funding is far above the objective.A new Queen is planned, as well as news stickers, bigger than Figopedia's (9cm diameter) and various mushrooms to help you enhance your display bases :)

It is a 2 bedroom house with a 900 sqft dance room (wood floors and mirrors), a 200 sqft painting, sculpting etc. room AND a large 900 sqft terrace overlooking the amazing countryside of Fraine, Italy! There is also an amazing beach 25 minutes down hill! Artists will have the entire home to themselves one group at a time to create. I will also be providing artists with 2 sets of the ear me now translation ear buds: two earpieces to be worn by two people who do not speak the same language and uses an app so the duo can converse with ease in real time. 
What is a residency
A residency program invites artists to live in a specific locale and spend a period of time intensively working on self-directed projects.
 
About the area
The town Fraine, is in the province of Chieti, Abruzzo in the center of Italy. Just hrs from Rome, Florence, Naples etc, yet in a rural remote region with breathtaking views and where you can really experience real Italian culture. There are only 1000 inhabitants in this town. There is also a beautiful beach 25 minutes down hill.
The province, Chieti, is amongst the most ancient of Italian cities. Founded by the greeks, this is a pre-Roman town but eventually was taken over by the Romans. In 1806 Chieti was turned into a fortress by Napoleon's France. In 1860 it became part of the newly created Kingdom of Italy.  Allied forces liberated the city on June 9, 1944, one day after the Germans left the city. 
There are many museums and beautiful churches to visit while in Abruzzo.
 
Why I need your support
This is a dream come true for me, to provide an inspirational space for artists to create work. ""LA Figlia"" means ""the daughter"". This house, this work, this long time dream is dedicated to my daughter. To see the growth and work that will come out of the artists experience at La Figlia, will be a continuing inspiration to me and my family. 
I have just started the process of purchasing this amazing house. This is a huge and exciting undertaking for me. I'm reaching out to you because my offer was accepted by the owner of this house and at the same time one of my funders backed out.  I really need all the help I can get to close this deal. 
 Any money you give is going to this great project and just take a look at these perks I'm offering!!

 
Where the money is going
- I need $15,000 to close this deal and give to the realtor. My family and I are covering the rest and we are also covering the repairs needed to make this property Artist ready.
REPAIRS
The installation of the wood floors, mirror and stereo - $3,500
Getting the bathroom updated - $2,500
Painting- $450
 

Opportunity
This is a great opportunity for artists to see history, to see archeological artifacts (so many still being uncovered) and most of all ART unlike any other! Italy is an exciting mecca of ART and CULTURE. It's rich with inspiration.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello My name is Amandla Baraka. </p>
<p>I was recently accepted into the Creative Minds in Cannes film program; which will be held in Cannes, France from May 13th, 2013-May 26th, 2013. The Creative Minds in Cannes film program is an amazing opportunity for exceptional students to piece together a film with a carefully selected group and have it viewed by, critiqued by, and showcased to film industry professionals. It also provides me with the opportunity to mingle with professionals and network with attendees/participants of the Cannes Film Festival.</p>
<p>The registration fee for the program totals to $2899.00 and round trip travel fees will range anywhere between $900 to $1000. I have until February 14th, 2013 to pay the registration fee IN FULL. I am reaching out because it is my understanding that you have the ability to help me gain the financial assistance that I urgently need, even if it isn't the entire amount. I will appreciate ANY assistance available. If you have more questions I may be reached via cell, email, or both. Phone: 301-525-1991 Email: amandlabaraka@yahoo.com. You may also refer to the official CMIC website <a href=""http://www.creativemindgroup.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.creativemindgroup.com</a></p>
<p> When I initially heard of the program, I knew this was an opportunity to exhibit my well-studied scriptwriting abilities. The CMIC recruitment team believed in me and gave me a chance. All I am asking is that you do the same.</p>

<h3>GLeo - Invited Artist</h3>
<p>""You have the virtue, I mean you really are privileged to make a living doing what you love. This is a privileged life is giving you, no one else. It is life giving you that privilege because even though you make a living from painting you meet others who have a thousand jobs AND also paint. Painting is your job...you get up in the morning, drink a cup of coffee and what do you have to do? Paint. If life is giving you this privilege, then what is the best way to honor and be thankful for life for such a gift? Doing it better every time."" - GLeo, video</p>

Contemplating one of her huge painted walls is an experience comparable to reading a fantastic book. You will get to meet with bright and colorful creatures, wearing freaky masks that will bring you back in the time of Colombia's original cultures. Right after this, you will have a chance to plunge into every one of the magic details GLeo paints, only with rollers and brushes, that make her imaginary worlds so complete and enchanting.

<h1><b>THANK YOU</b></h1>
</div></div></div>","GLeo - Invited Artist
""You have the virtue, I mean you really are privileged to make a living doing what you love. This is a privileged life is giving you, no one else. It is life giving you that privilege because even though you make a living from painting you meet others who have a thousand jobs AND also paint. Painting is your job...you get up in the morning, drink a cup of coffee and what do you have to do? Paint. If life is giving you this privilege, then what is the best way to honor and be thankful for life for such a gift? Doing it better every time."" - GLeo, video
The street artist GLeo, born and raised in Cali - Colombia, is one of the most thrilling figures of the new Latin American urban art scene. Contemplating one of her huge painted walls is an experience comparable to reading a fantastic book. You will get to meet with bright and colorful creatures, wearing freaky masks that will bring you back in the time of Colombia's original cultures. Right after this, you will have a chance to plunge into every one of the magic details GLeo paints, only with rollers and brushes, that make her imaginary worlds so complete and enchanting. And when the book closes, the return to earth can be a little bit dreary.

<h3>Who, Why, and When</h3>
<p>I'm a sculptor blazing a trail in a the highly unsual media of wool and felt, and now I'm branching out into interactive public art. I've been active in the California Bay Area art community for 16 years, and I've exhibited my work all over the world.</p>
<p>People often yearn to touch my visibly soft and mysterious felted wool sculpture, and when I invite them to do so it causes <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">friends and strangers alike to interact with each other in fleeting moments of shared wonder. I want to make that happen more, on a larger scale.  For over two years I've been working on a gallery exhibition of uniquely touchable large-scale sculpture. By enlisting the help of community volunteers in the hands-on artmaking, 'InTouch' is already becoming a successful experiment in getting audiences to connect with the art and each other. </span></p>
</div><div>
<p>In six months 'InTouch' will debut as a free public art exhibition at Santa Clara University's de Saisset Museum, where it will show for 20 weeks and reach upwards of 8,000 visitors. As I head into the home stretch I'm looking for more partners to help me finish funding the project. I've already raised $17K of this $40K project; I'm turning to Indiegogo to help finish it.</p>
<p>I'm so excited to present 'InTouch'-- I can hardly wait to observe how visitors react and interact with the sculpture I’ve been planning and making for over two years. For me, the audience response will be a big part of the artwork.</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Between materials, labor, and workspace, spread out over two years 'InTouch' is a $40K self-funded venture. I’ve already raised $17K through direct donations from individuals, some small grants, and sales of related work. With the addition of significant in-kind donations from the venue, the remaining costs add up to $15K. I’m looking to my wider network to find kindred spirits who want to be a part of making this happen and raise the remaining $15K to bring this project to completion. Funds will be used to construct a steel framework to suspend the 'Hanging Pod' sculptures (since the ceiling of the museum turns out not to be an option), to pay studio assistants, and rent for my studio workspace. See the FAQs for more info.</p>
<p>The perks I'm offering highlight another unique facet of my work: reproductions of 'wool drawings' I create by pushing wool through paper. Additionally I'm offering catalogs and some private events, workshops, and tours to invite you in behind the scenes.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This project has been an experiment from the very beginning: what that means is that nothing quite like it ever existed, and I've been making it all up as I go. </p>
<p>Happily that fundamental challenge is one I've been in the habit of facing and overcoming throughout my 16-year career as a sculptor. Artists have to learn to be comfortable with confidently following their creative impulses without always knowing what the results will be. We pick up skills, resources, experience, and helpers along the way. We educate ourselves and learn what questions to ask. And we pay close attention to the successes and 'failures'-- which generally are nonfatal learning experiences that we carry forward into the next iteration.</p>
<p>I’m applying lessons from all sorts of past experiences with materials, processes, and people to make this new, larger, touchable, public work-- and it’s coming along brilliantly.</p>
<p>We artists also get a lot of flack for being too focused on the creative side to the detriment of business skills-- but I'm here to tell you that to work as a solvent artist over time takes all the same skills as being a CEO with way less of the acknowledgement. </p>
<p>There’s a section I love in Andrew Simonet’s book <i>Making It</i> that addresses the myth that Artists Are Bad With Money: </p>
<ul><li>“It started because artists, unlike much of the world, are not primarily motivated or controlled by money. Artists are actually amazing with money, but we usually don’t have enough of it.  In the for-profit world, someone gives you a project and 100% of the budget necessary to complete it. If you deliver the project on time you are genius, a brilliant manager, and you have a job for life. <i> In the arts, you have a project and somewhere between 0% and 50% of the budget needed, and you still deliver the project on time. That makes you a double genius. </i>Making art with limited resources requires incredible financial skill.”</li></ul>
<p>I’m not only the lead artist and creative developer on this project, I’m also the project manager, marketer, public relations manager, personnel manager, and fundraiser. And I have a track record of success from other projects in all of those realms. This is a bigger project than I’ve ever attempted before, but it follows on years of building up to this scale. And the myriad personal connections I’ve made throughout the process of bringing 'InTouch' to life are helping in each realm. I have a lot of volunteers and supporters on my side. So the only risk at this point is in me not reaching out to everyone who might care about this project to ensure it gets fully funded. </p>
<p>That's not a risk I'm going to take.</p>

Two full
days of guided workshops, community meals and accommodation at Elsewhere costs

While
we already have our travel expenses covered, we are looking to raise $1,000
from our community of Hamiltonian Friends and Family to help make this
retreat a reality for all ten Hamiltonian Fellows.
YOUR IMPACT
Your
support will make this artistic retreat possible but, above all, provide each
fellow with an unique opportunity to:

collaborate and connect
have space and time for reflection, research and production


experiment with new materials

immerse in another mode of working

explore his/her practice in community

be inspired by new surroundings and people

Thank
you for helping us to provide our fellows with this once in a lifetime
experience!  Every donation - small and large -  will go a long way and is greatly appreciated!
Thank
you!

</h3>
<p>My perspective is incredibly hopeful + positive. I trust in my

challenges (life happens!) would be addressed with clear
communication, flexibility, and the intent to persevere.</p>

traveling away from home, so we have to very wisely use the week+ we
have together to meet all of our creative goals. It will be necessary
to do a lot of planning, scripting, and chatting before his trip.
Lastly, I acknowledge that building my small business from the ground
up will be hard work; I'm ready! There will likely be a bit of a
learning curve when it comes to using Etsy, filing paperwork, or
doing whatever tasks need to be done to legitimize my business. I am
blessed to have friends and mentors who will see me through these
processes, though. 
</p>
<p>Something to consider, dear audience, is that I've worked
independently for years on creative projects. I even designed by own

I have a good track record and high rate of productivity, because I
am innately motivated to do this work. Gracias!!</p>

We started off reading it in a living room. Then we took it a step further, rented a space, and rehearsed it without a director - just the seven of us figuring out how to tell this wonderfully eerie and complex and unique story about a family of six sisters. Six sisters who must never stop stirring a pot. (And the outsider who finds her way into their world.) We put up a reading of the play, and the audience response confirmed what we already knew: this story is special.  It’s visceral yet fluid; it’s violent yet full of love. And that felt very exciting to us. Not only is BREWED a play written for seven women, women who are distinct, women who fight and claw and pick and talk over each other and get by, but there’s something in it for everyone.

Prin natura sa unică, spectacolul vine cu un suflu nou, creat cu o echipă de 20 de actori tineri, care odată cu personajele își creează propriile păreri despre lume și realitatea pe care o trăiesc în România zilei de azi. </p><p><strong>Spectacolul inspiră prin diversitatea formelor artistice pe care le pune în scenă (teatru, dans, muzică, proiecții), performanța actorilor și viziunea regizorală a Antoanetei Cojocaru. </strong></p><p>HAMLET ȘI NOI este <strong>un spectacol itinerant</strong> - își mută scena la fiecare reprezentație în clădiri de patrimoniu și muzee din București și din țară. Prin acest demers dorim sa atragem atenția asupra specificului aparte al caselor cu istorie, parte din identitatea României, de a ne petrece o clipă în aerul lor boem, dar și pentru a trage un semnal de alarmă asupra degradării <strong>patrimoniului cultural urban</strong>. </p><p>Ediția a doua HAMLET ȘI NOI în clădiri de patrimoniu este co-finațată de Administrația Fondului Cultural Național. Proiectul nu reprezintă în mod necesar poziția Administrației Fondului Cultural Național.

Eram 10 oameni la început, ”studenții mei” ne spunea Antoaneta, eram prima grupă pentru care ținea un curs de actorie. Veneam de la facultăți și job-uri care nu aveau nici o legătură cu arta, iar cursul de teatru  a devenit un spațiu unde ne provocam limitele și unde ne puteam exprima autentic și liber.  3 ani a durat cursul, timp în care am descoperit frumusețea teatrului și puterea eliberatoare a artei. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560685360/pcpocg9pkfunaxowa9ts.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Masterclass Hamlet </strong><br/>În 2016, septembrie, am simțit că e firesc să mergem mai departe. Așa că am dat de știre în lume că suntem în căutare de studenți UNATC și absolvenți, alături de care să participăm la un Master Class pe actorie, tot cu Antoaneta. În următoarele luni ne-am jucat mult, ne-am cunoscut, am învățat tehnici de actorie și de arta actorului.

Prin natura sa unică, spectacolul vine cu un suflu nou, creat cu o echipă de 20 de actori tineri, care odată cu personajele își creează propriile păreri despre lume și realitatea pe care o trăiesc în România zilei de azi. Spectacolul inspiră prin diversitatea formelor artistice pe care le pune în scenă (teatru, dans, muzică, proiecții), performanța actorilor și viziunea regizorală a Antoanetei Cojocaru. HAMLET ȘI NOI este un spectacol itinerant - își mută scena la fiecare reprezentație în clădiri de patrimoniu și muzee din București și din țară. Prin acest demers dorim sa atragem atenția asupra specificului aparte al caselor cu istorie, parte din identitatea României, de a ne petrece o clipă în aerul lor boem, dar și pentru a trage un semnal de alarmă asupra degradării patrimoniului cultural urban. Ediția a doua HAMLET ȘI NOI în clădiri de patrimoniu este co-finațată de Administrația Fondului Cultural Național. Proiectul nu reprezintă în mod necesar poziția Administrației Fondului Cultural Național. AFCN nu este responsabilă de conținutul proiectului sau de modul în care rezultatele proiectului pot fi folosite. Acestea sunt în întregime responsabilitatea beneficiarului finanțării.  Povestea HAMLET ȘI NOICursul de teatru cu Antoaneta CojocaruPovestea Hamlet și noi a început în septembrie 2016, însă oamenii care o construiesc au început să se adune în 2014. Eram 10 oameni la început, ”studenții mei” ne spunea Antoaneta, eram prima grupă pentru care ținea un curs de actorie. Veneam de la facultăți și job-uri care nu aveau nici o legătură cu arta, iar cursul de teatru  a devenit un spațiu unde ne provocam limitele și unde ne puteam exprima autentic și liber.  3 ani a durat cursul, timp în care am descoperit frumusețea teatrului și puterea eliberatoare a artei.  Masterclass Hamlet În 2016, septembrie, am simțit că e firesc să mergem mai departe. Așa că am dat de știre în lume că suntem în căutare de studenți UNATC și absolvenți, alături de care să participăm la un Master Class pe actorie, tot cu Antoaneta. În următoarele luni ne-am jucat mult, ne-am cunoscut, am învățat tehnici de actorie și de arta actorului. Master Class-ul s-a transformat, iar noi am început să construim spectacolul “Hamlet”.  La Noaptea Albă a Muzeelor, am avut prima reprezentație, cu Primul Act din Hamlet. Am jucat în acea seară de 3 ori  deși erau programate doar 2, oamenii stăteau la coadă să intre la HAMLET. Atunci am știut că oamenii au nevoie de artă. Am construit timp de  6 luni celelalte patru acte din HAMLET. Pe perioada repetițiilor căutam și finanțări și parteneriate care să ne ajute să scoatem spectacolul. Investisem foarte mult în proiect însă fără un sprijin din exterior nu am fi reușit să aducem spectacol în fața publicului. Am reușit să-i găsim pe acei oameni, organizații și companii care s-au alăturat demersului nostru - suntem mândri să spunem că proiectul HAMLET ȘI NOI a fost realizat de artiști însă susținut de oameni care iubesc arta, iar aportul a fost egal.  HAMLET ȘI NOI - prima edițiePrimul spectacol HAMLET ȘI NOI a fost la Muzeul de Istorie a României, un loc în care nici nu visasem că vom juca. Au urmat alte spectacole în case de patrimoniu și muzee din București: Muzeul Municipiului București - Palatul Suțu, Vila Oromolu, Muzeul Național de Artă al României, Casa Universitarilor, Palatul Cercului Militar Național, Centrul Cultural Nicolae Bălcescu. Au participat peste 2000 de spectatori: unii care au venit chiar și de 5 ori sa vadă spectacolul, alții care au stat și în picioare și pe jos, unii care după ce au văzut spectacolul au intrat în echipa proiectului ca voluntari.  HAMLET ȘI NOI - a doua edițieAnul acesta, cu ajutorul AFCN, am reușit să avem și o a doua ediție a proiectului HAMLET ȘI NOI care a cuprins pe lângă 3 spectacole în clădiri de patrimoniu și muzee din București și alte 2 spectacole în țară - la Palatul ASTRA din Sibiu și Centrul Cultural Reduta din Brașov. Pe lângă clădirile de patrimoniu și muzeele în care vom juca HAMLET ȘI NOI în această ediție, vom promova și alte 30 de case de patrimoniu din România care merită vizitate și unde ne propunem în viitor să jucăm spectacolul HAMLET ȘI NOI. Dezvoltăm astfel o hartă culturală a proiectului cu peste 30 de case și muzee reprezentante ale patrimoniului cultural autohton. Investiția ta presupuneDe la începutul proiectului, în 2017, până în prezent, proiectul HAMLET ȘI NOI a obținut susținere financiară de la Ministerul Culturii (11 000 $),  de la AFCN (17 050 $)  și 6000 $ de la Mobexpert (pentru decor). De asemenea, echipa din spatele proiectului a investit peste 12 000 $ în producție și susținerea mai departe a spectacolului. Pentru ce-a de a doua ediție a proiectului mai avem nevoie să strângem 2900 $ pentru a susține ultimul spectacol HAMLET ȘI NOI care se va desfășura la ARCUB Gabroveni în 18 iulie 2019.Cum se vor distribui fondurile:Un alt important scop pentru care ne-am decis să începem această companie de crowdfunding este pentru a încuraja comunitatea iubitorilor de artă să susțină proiecte artistice independente care nu pot concura altfel cu un buget de teatru de stat.Dorința noastră de viitor este să ajungem să jucam spectacolul HAMLET ȘI NOI în fiecare lună într-o clădire de patrimoniu din București și din alte orașe din țară, să dezvoltăm o hartă culturală cu aceste spații pe care să le promovăm ca alternative pentru săli de spectacole. Ce îți oferim

<p>Hello Hello. As many of you know I provided downtown Plymouth with safe and sterile body piercing for almost twenty years. Due to work related conflicts I was forced to step down from a position I truly loved. For the past year or so I have been looking for a new endeavor to dedicate myself to but I couldn’t deny that I missed what I have always done. My passion is in this field, and it would mean the world to me to continue to provide people with a positive body piercing experience. </p>
<p>This is where I ask for your help. I am reaching out to my tens and thousands of happy customers to help make this dream a reality. I have secured a building and will need to create a new shop from the ground up. This will require building walls, running electrical and plumbing, filling the shop with high quality jewelry as well as re licensing and branding myself so I can once again be ‘Americas hometown piercer.’ It is my hope to have this up and running as soon as possible. I know that this will take months of hard work, and I am more than ready to take on this new chapter.</p>
<p>Even if you choose not to donate, I thank you for taking the time to read this. I have had so many great years in this field and I look forward to many, many more.  Let's get weird.-Matt</p>

<p><strong>Campaign Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hi y'all! I am heading to the Vermont Studio Center in Johnson, VT for a one month Artist Residency. I was selected from a wide range of applicants all across the globe that will come together for the purpose of creating and learning with others that are dedicated to their craft. </p>
<p>The total cost of this residency is $3,900 and I received on a merit and work study scholarship $1,100, so I am asking you, philanthropists and friends, to assist me in achieving my goal in matching my scholarship in funding or get me all the way to $2,800 which would not only help me pay for the fees and tuition but for flights and materials needed to make this residency happen!</p>
<p>During this residency I will be creating a brand new body of work, consisting mainly of paintings and drawings. This residency isn't just something to put on my CV, it means that I will be able to focus all my time and energy into just my artwork, a challenging task I have not had the chance at tackling since I completed my BFA in Painting in 2015. I am beyond happy to share this with you and I hope you can support this journey by selecting one of the <u><i>perks</i></u> I have to offer for your gift of giving for this exciting project! As I have a deadline to put down my tuition and buy flights, sharing or donating is very appreciated even if you can't donate or purchase a perk!! Thank you!</p>
<p>Be sure to check out my website for more available works to purchase! <a href=""http://jeffreyheiman.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jeffreyheiman.tumblr.com</a> or at my instagram page <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jeffreyheimanart/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/jeffreyheimanart/</a></p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>There are some setbacks if I don't reach my projected goal. However, my pricing for the <i><u>perks</u></i> is at a VALUE rate and if only THREE donors join the Collector's Circle then I will have already gone above and beyond my expectations!! In addition, there are even options for rewards that wouldn't cost more than taking me out to lunch, and you even get a couple postcards! I believe we can do this but I need friends, family, and even admirers of my work to get involved and donate! I won't let you down.</p>

I’m thrilled to share that BOA has offered me the role of Gianni Schicchi in the beautiful Opera Gianni Schicchi by Giacomo Puccini. It would be an honor for me to accept the role and participate in this prestigious program. However, I cannot do it without your generous help. Berlin Opera Academy's esteemed program tuition totals to €4950 not including the cost of air travel and the various expenses for living in Berlin. This program would extend me the advantage of a career by providing the chance for me to sing a full principal role and make professional connections in the European classical voice circuit.I won a scholarship but unfortunately it is not enough. To participate in this wonderful experience and career opportunity I need an additional 4000 € for school fees + airfare and miscellaneous expenses to live in Berlin.Have a look at the website - www.berlinoperaacademy.comI will send you all my artistic updates and who know, if karma will want, to have the opportunity to sing for all of you in a famous theater.I would appreciate any help you can lend including sincere words of encouragement.Thank-you for your support",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>You can't talk about East Jesus without first talking about Charles Stephen Russell. Here was a man who had it all: education, insight, wisdom, charisma, potential, and he took it out to the desert with him to pursue a dream. a desire to get away, to experience freedom, to live on his own terms, to pursue his art and music away from conformity and critics, to be free.</p>

<p>In the short time he was here he accomplished that and more. He cleaned up a literal garbage dump and turned it into a sculpture garden and zen center. He encouraged other like-minded individuals to visit and take their hand at building East Jesus, to entertain their dreams and visions as works of art, whether sculpture, music, photography, storytelling, or more esoteric genres like fire, nudity, and shotguns. He allowed artists a place to show their work within Nature's own splendor, back-lit by vivid sunsets. He and his friends built a home that still welcomes new visitors with a hug.</p>

<h3> Who I am and what I hope to achieve.</h3>
<p>     Everyone has a dream. It's embedded within us and is a burning passion that we cannot ignore. Being a full-time actress is mine. My name is Megan Hensley and I am from Des Moines, Iowa. I was born and raised here by my lovely mama, gram grams and father. I have been acting since I was in middle school and professionally acting for over 6 years. I have studied at many different places and I have been a part of many different projects. (Feel free to view my resume on my site.) <a href=""http://www.meganhensley.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.meganhensley.com</a>  I have agents in 4 different states. I am very passionate about acting and there is nothing else that I would rather be doing. It completes me in many ways. I cannot be a full-time actress where I am located, therefore, I am looking to relocate to L.A. to follow my path. I am not asking for money, I am willing to work hard for it</p>
<p>    This campaign is very important to me because it will help me get where I need to be to be at the level that I want to be at. I have been working a regular job and doing different projects but most of my money goes to traveling to auditions and shoots. I have 5000$ saved up and I know how expensive L.A. can be. Also, I can help the people that help me.</p>
<p>   <strong>If you donate to my fund, I will be able to tackle my dreams full throttle.  Every dollar helps.  If you cannot afford to help me, you could post a link to my page=)</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p> The money will go toward workshops, gas, headshots, rent, business cards etc. I am a great budgeter and I spend my money wisely=) </p>
<p>  I have a list of wonderful perks to choose from! You can also personalize any of them that you want to! For instance, if you want me to paint your walls instead of mow your lawn...or you want a coconut cream pie instead of a dozen cookies...just let me know! If you live out of state, give me a task that I can do from where I am=)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Everything helps!</h3>
<p>  Every little bit helps! Whether you are paying me to knit you a scarf, watch your children or even if you copy and paste my link, you are helping me out tons! </p>
<p>  I will stick to my word. You give me a date that works for you and we will figure something out! I make goodies for friends all of the time, I have helped my mom with her daycare my entire life and I am a hard worker.</p>
<p>   I know that nothing in this world is free. You have to earn what you want. Everything takes work. I know that being an actress isn't easy. I drive 2-5 hours for auditions several times a week. I am not always guaranteed the work...but I go for it anyway. I am willing to work to have the opportunity to work=)</p>

SupporterMark
Kelley products help support local causes in a variety of ways.  Since their inception in 1989 Mark Kelley
calendars sales have helped generate over $20,000 in total annual donations to
Discovery Southeast and the Juneau Raptor Center.  Mark is a former soccer coach, and during the
Christmas holiday Mark Kelley’s calendar sales support fundraising efforts by local
soccer teams, raising more than $10,000 each year.  A percentage of sales from Mark’s book “Alaska’s
Watchable Whales” supports the work of whale researcher Jan Straley, and the
Sitka Sound Science Center.
Mark is a
regular speaker at community events and with his slideshows shares the beauty
of Southeast Alaska with locals and visitors alike.  Mark Kelley supports the local public schools

Sculpture will also be included as the Gallery expands. <br/></p>
<p>The Town of Gibsons has granted us approval to use public property for the installation of the Gallery's up to 40  pieces of local weatherproof artwork, including 30 two dimensional originals and 10 sculptures.</p>
<p>All artwork will be for sale, and at the end of the year long exhibition, anything not sold will be auctioned off thus enabling us to install a  fresh batch of artwork. <b><i>With your help</i>,  t</b><i><b>he Outdoor Art Gallery will become the only social enterprise Gallery in the World, operating entirely outdoors. </b> </i>No bricks, no mortar, just FRESH ART in the FRESH AIR<br/></p>
<p>It will be a unique venue for artists to showcase their work, will beautify the Town and will attract much needed tourism thus benefiting local merchants.  <i><br/></i></p>

<p>Following the Gallery's first successful year of operation in Gibsons, the Outdoor Art Gallery will continue to open similar Paint Our Town exhibits in various small Towns throughout British Columbia and North America with artwork specific to that particular community. We believe that an outdoor art gallery will have the biggest impact in smaller towns where the citizens can actively support the artists. <br/></p>

</div> <div style=""text-align: center;""> <h2>The Local Impact</h2> <p>The Town of Gibsons, BC has a small population of 4,000 people, and is part of a community of small towns known as the Sunshine Coast. Transportation into the area is very difficult due to the total lack of roads and the sole option is a 40 minute ferry ride across Howe Sound into the Town.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Town granted the Gallery permission to use public lands and buildings due to the perceived community benefits, which include the added perk of delighting tourists and simultaneously benefiting artists. The Outdoor Art Gallery will brighten up and beautify the Town. It will also benefit local merchants since more art-inspired tourists will spend more time and money in the Town.</p>

<br/><h1>Art Walk</h1>An art walk map will be printed and distributed so that art lovers can take a stroll and see all the artwork.  The map will show the locations and the names of artists and their works.  <br/><br/>In addition, we will provide a downloadable smartphone application that will map the art walk and provide viewers with information about the art and the artist.  <br/><br/><h1>Funding the Arts</h1>We are making all the artwork available for sale plus we will be seeking ongoing sponsorships and sell prints, cards and books of the artwork.  We are committed to a healthy arts community in Gibsons and thus a portion of any profit will be donated to art related projects and activities in the Town.  The more installations we achieve, the greater the potential funding we can generate. <br/><br/><h1>What About Your Town?</h1>If you live in a small Town, perhaps it would benefit from a <b><i>Paint Our Town</i></b> campaign of its own.  Once we've established the Outdoor Art Gallery in Gibsons, we'll have a blueprint for other Towns.  It's part of our mission - to expand the Outdoor Art Gallery concept so that other Towns and artists benefit.  In helping us, you will potentially be helping out other Towns as well.  <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2> <p> To operate an Outdoor Art Gallery, we have some challenges that you, our supporters should be aware of:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Weather - ensuring the two dimensional artwork will withstand the weather, including rain, hot sun and wind. To overcome this, we will require that the work be weatherproofed with silicone and varnishes and that the panels used will be suitable for an outdoor environment.  <br/>
</li> <li>Vandalism - we are concerned that there might be vandalism or ""tagging"" of the artwork.  In similar small communities where public artwork is on display this hasn't become a major problem.  We believe that continual communication, especially with the Town's youth will sensitize them to the benefits of the gallery. We will be working with the Town's youth outreach counselors to avoid this from becoming a problem.  </li>
<li>Theft - while this is always a concern, we will be working with law enforcement in the Town to request they pay particular attention to the issue.  In addition, the artworks will be large works and in many cases they will require specialized equipment to remove.  Again, education and awareness are the principal tools to prevent this from occurring. <br/>
</li>
<li>Establishment of anything new is a challenge.  One of the inspirations for the Paint Our Town project was the small town of Chemainus, BC who installed, over a period of 30 years, 42 murals.  We are expecting to install that same number of works in a much shorter time and then rotate the work on an annual exhibition cycle.</li>

</div></div>","Paint Our Town  Paint Our Town is a campaign to raise funds to install artwork outdoors in the small Town of Gibsons,  British Columbia (near Vancouver).  It's an initiative of the Outdoor Art Gallery.  It will be a year-round exhibition of original artwork on building walls and also attached to free standing wooden structures on public lands! Sculpture will also be included as the Gallery expands. 
The Town of Gibsons has granted us approval to use public property for the installation of the Gallery's up to 40  pieces of local weatherproof artwork, including 30 two dimensional originals and 10 sculptures.
All artwork will be for sale, and at the end of the year long exhibition, anything not sold will be auctioned off thus enabling us to install a  fresh batch of artwork. With your help,  the Outdoor Art Gallery will become the only social enterprise Gallery in the World, operating entirely outdoors.  No bricks, no mortar, just FRESH ART in the FRESH AIR
It will be a unique venue for artists to showcase their work, will beautify the Town and will attract much needed tourism thus benefiting local merchants.  



                                                       A view of Gibsons harbour

Following the Gallery's first successful year of operation in Gibsons, the Outdoor Art Gallery will continue to open similar Paint Our Town exhibits in various small Towns throughout British Columbia and North America with artwork specific to that particular community. We believe that an outdoor art gallery will have the biggest impact in smaller towns where the citizens can actively support the artists. 
As seen in the image below, the first 4' x 8' piece by Elizabeth Ann Evans was recently unveiled and will be installed  in the Town.
""Trilogy in Time"" characterizes sea, land & sky with an eagle, whale & deer. The dim shadow of a bear emphasizes to us that if habitats disappear, so too will the animals whose survival depends upon them. 


""The Outdoor Art Gallery is a movement to install artwork outside the walls of a gallery and into the community where it can be appreciated by more people.  Fresh Art in the Fresh Air.""

Taking It One Brush Stroke at a Time In order to successfully install the Outdoor Art Gallery, we need your support in raising $12,000 CAD, which will be used to pay for the installations including... 

Structures for Artwork


Legal & insurance


Publicity & Social Media


Hi-Res Photography of the Art


Postcard prints


Poster prints


Limited Edition prints


Postage


Fulfillment of rewards


Event video/photos


Commemorative book


Gallery website


Averaged out, each installation costs approximately $2,000.  Our goal is to install a minimum of 6 installations and of course, if we exceed this goal, additional installations will be possible.  We have identified about 40 locations where we'd love to Paint Our Town. 
  The Local Impact The Town of Gibsons, BC has a small population of 4,000 people, and is part of a community of small towns known as the Sunshine Coast. Transportation into the area is very difficult due to the total lack of roads and the sole option is a 40 minute ferry ride across Howe Sound into the Town.

The Town granted the Gallery permission to use public lands and buildings due to the perceived community benefits, which include the added perk of delighting tourists and simultaneously benefiting artists. The Outdoor Art Gallery will brighten up and beautify the Town. It will also benefit local merchants since more art-inspired tourists will spend more time and money in the Town.

Art WalkAn art walk map will be printed and distributed so that art lovers can take a stroll and see all the artwork.  The map will show the locations and the names of artists and their works.  In addition, we will provide a downloadable smartphone application that will map the art walk and provide viewers with information about the art and the artist.  Funding the ArtsWe are making all the artwork available for sale plus we will be seeking ongoing sponsorships and sell prints, cards and books of the artwork.  We are committed to a healthy arts community in Gibsons and thus a portion of any profit will be donated to art related projects and activities in the Town.  The more installations we achieve, the greater the potential funding we can generate. What About Your Town?If you live in a small Town, perhaps it would benefit from a Paint Our Town campaign of its own.  Once we've established the Outdoor Art Gallery in Gibsons, we'll have a blueprint for other Towns.  It's part of our mission - to expand the Outdoor Art Gallery concept so that other Towns and artists benefit.  In helping us, you will potentially be helping out other Towns as well.  
  Risks & Challenges  To operate an Outdoor Art Gallery, we have some challenges that you, our supporters should be aware of: 
Weather - ensuring the two dimensional artwork will withstand the weather, including rain, hot sun and wind. To overcome this, we will require that the work be weatherproofed with silicone and varnishes and that the panels used will be suitable for an outdoor environment.  
 Vandalism - we are concerned that there might be vandalism or ""tagging"" of the artwork.  In similar small communities where public artwork is on display this hasn't become a major problem.  We believe that continual communication, especially with the Town's youth will sensitize them to the benefits of the gallery. We will be working with the Town's youth outreach counselors to avoid this from becoming a problem.  
Theft - while this is always a concern, we will be working with law enforcement in the Town to request they pay particular attention to the issue.  In addition, the artworks will be large works and in many cases they will require specialized equipment to remove.  Again, education and awareness are the principal tools to prevent this from occurring. 

Establishment of anything new is a challenge.  One of the inspirations for the Paint Our Town project was the small town of Chemainus, BC who installed, over a period of 30 years, 42 murals.  We are expecting to install that same number of works in a much shorter time and then rotate the work on an annual exhibition cycle.

<p>In this exhibition, we employ light as an artistic expression to stimulate the interaction between human beings. Our interest is developing a discourse on the influence of artificial light on social behavior, expecially after the development of synthetic light sources and electronic devices.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Light plays a vital role in regulating our circadian rhythm, as one of our natural biological rhythms: human beings are naturally dependent on physical and psychological light. In addition, light can easily create and intervene in space, leading to different perspectives of the same space and a feeling of integration in the virtual space. </p>
<p>In <i>Phototaxis - the movement towards light</i>, we explore different interpretations of light from a scientific and philosophical perspective, with the continuous reference to history of art.</p>
<p>We have invited eight artists to partecipate to our exhibition.</p>
<p><strong>Roland Burkart</strong>, a French artist based in Munich and recently featured in Salon de Montrouge , will present a video work.</p>
<p><strong>Mali Arun</strong>, a French artist based in Berlin, will present a sculpture that was recently featured in Salon de Montrouge 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Dowling</strong>, a British artist based in Amsterdam, will present two commissioned brand-new neon sculptures.</p>
<p><strong>Emilie Brout and Maxime Marion</strong>, a duo of French artists based in Paris, will present a sculpture part of their famous installation ""The Return of The Broken Screen"".</p>
<p><strong>Pierre Bellot</strong>, a French artist based in Paris, will present an oil painting on paper that was featured in 100% Beaux-Arts show at La Villette.</p>
<p><strong>Matteo Fieni</strong>, a Swiss artist based in Paris, will present a serie of photographs recently displayed at Cité Internationale des Arts, as the artist is resident there.</p>
<p><strong>Ellen Barratt</strong>, a British artist based in London and who just graduated from art school, will present her immersive installation. </p>

</div></div>","The exhibition PHOTOTAXIS - the movement towards light, will be held from 25th to 31st October 2018, at Untitled Factory in Paris.
 We sincerely thank you for your support to our project.

                                                  Pierre Bellot - Untitled (Japanese bath), 2017
In this exhibition, we employ light as an artistic expression to stimulate the interaction between human beings. Our interest is developing a discourse on the influence of artificial light on social behavior, expecially after the development of synthetic light sources and electronic devices.

Light plays a vital role in regulating our circadian rhythm, as one of our natural biological rhythms: human beings are naturally dependent on physical and psychological light. In addition, light can easily create and intervene in space, leading to different perspectives of the same space and a feeling of integration in the virtual space. 
In Phototaxis - the movement towards light, we explore different interpretations of light from a scientific and philosophical perspective, with the continuous reference to history of art.
We have invited eight artists to partecipate to our exhibition.
Roland Burkart, a French artist based in Munich and recently featured in Salon de Montrouge , will present a video work.
Mali Arun, a French artist based in Berlin, will present a sculpture that was recently featured in Salon de Montrouge 2018.
Helen Dowling, a British artist based in Amsterdam, will present two commissioned brand-new neon sculptures.
Emilie Brout and Maxime Marion, a duo of French artists based in Paris, will present a sculpture part of their famous installation ""The Return of The Broken Screen"".
Pierre Bellot, a French artist based in Paris, will present an oil painting on paper that was featured in 100% Beaux-Arts show at La Villette.
Matteo Fieni, a Swiss artist based in Paris, will present a serie of photographs recently displayed at Cité Internationale des Arts, as the artist is resident there.
Ellen Barratt, a British artist based in London and who just graduated from art school, will present her immersive installation. 

                               
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mali Arun, Kein Licht (Sans lumière), 2017
 
We need a total of 1000 euros for the exhibition.
All the funding will be used in 4 parts:
1. Venue rental: 65% of the funding will be used to rent a place to hold the exhibition;
2. Support of artists, insurance and transportation of artworks: 25% of the funding will go to the artistic support;
3. Venue installation and vernissage: 7% of the funding will be used to buy equipment and materials for exhibition and vernissage;
4. Communication: 3% of the funding will be used for printed materials.

<p>The photo book What Remains is the story of 14 people who have Alzheimers. It celebrates who they are and what they cherish. Although at times documentary in format, it is created as an art piece, intentionally portraying them in a way that does not betray their condition but focuses on the one thing that they love most, that which still today, defines them. It is also a personal series that chronicles my own journey - 3 years of visits to the Saint Monique nursing home, one of Brussels' most diverse and independent nursing homes - getting to know these people, collecting their stories, and reflecting on memory and loss. Now, I'm looking for your help, to publish this work as a book.</p>

<h3>Why is this book important?</h3>
<p>There are currently an estimated 50 million people worldwide living with dementia, with one new case every three seconds.  Dementia knows no social, economic, ethnic or geographical boundaries and currently has no cure.  Each experience of this illness is unique yet dementia is often hidden away, not spoken about, not even diagnosed, often feared or ignored. Those affected are often stigmatized and become, with their families and caregivers, isolated.</p>
<p>This project intends to lift the stigma associated with the illness, give it a real face, humanize it by focusing on the beautiful faces and stories of real men and women who are affected by it. It encourages conversations about dementia beyond whispers in homes or care centers to a wider audience. I believe that if we can change people’s perception of this illness, we can protect those affected from the isolation, support care and research programmes that are inclusive and caring, and create an open dialogue around dementia.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527932771/p37ochdhpx3q2cbqnclm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Edith nurtures space, that which sits between breaths, between people, between words. She always loved writing. When she first came to the nursing home she’d often add notes to nurses’ daily journal. What betrayed her, was the fact that her handwriting was so beautiful. </i></p>
<h3>Who am I and what's my story?</h3>
<p>My father, whom I adored was diagnosed with advanced Alzheimers in 2010. A proud, public and intelligent man, he worked hard at hiding his condition, including to us, his family, so to not worry or burden us. Obsessed with secretly understanding my father and what he was going through, my response was to learn all I could about this disease - started reading all I could about the illness, asking doctors questions and even taking online courses, making random connections to the condition everywhere.</p>
<p>One day I read about how Polaroid fades and all the ways people make sure this doesn't happen. I instantly made me think of dementia and how this technology was similar to the illness and how essentially it was a metaphor for the ephemerality of life. In that moment, I imagined a portrait series of people who had Alzheimer's on Polaroid.</p>
<p>In 2015, when my father suddenly passed away and I became a mother shortly after, my series idea haunted me and I had the calling to move it out of my head and finally produce this work - regardless of what came of this work. I am thrilled to be able to show this work in an exhibition for the upcoming September Alzheimers Awareness Month in Brussels. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What will your contribution support?</h3>
<p>I have already self-funded collecting all the portraits and stories. If the campaign is successful, we will develop a beautiful art book of these portraits and these stories (polaroid, words, qoutes, ancedotes and annotations). Our intention is to create a book that feels like an art object, a play on paper, an experience, an extension of the accompanying travelling exhibition. Funds will be used to have the photographs professionally scanned, the book designed and printed, as well the shipping and logistics of the perks. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527931990/zqodh4c8vsx8xeaklbig.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If we surpass our goal, this will allow for the exhbit to be translated into other languages than English and for extra copies of the book to be printed and donated to schools, support groups, and nursing homes. We hope that the book will be used as a tool to discuss compassion and care for those with dementia.</p>
</div><div>
<p>If you have suggestions regarding groups, nursing homes, schools, and other organisations we should connect with, please email me.</p>
<h3>Why Crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>While the <strong>What Remains </strong>project has always been self-funded, publishing a book is very expensive and requires that I hire others. I also see this crowdfunding campaign, like the book, as a means to engage with a wider audience, open up positive conversations about dementia.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527931910/jlwwxzl5lnb9qb3mdxsi.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I expect the book to be published by September 2018, but because we are in the early stages of the production process, delays may arise. We have, of course, planned and are doing our outmost to avoid delays. I will regularly update contributors with the status of the project.</p>
</div><div><p>Also, given today’s publishing environment, an art book can be a risk.

This project intends to lift the stigma associated with the illness, give it a real face, humanize it by focusing on the beautiful faces and stories of real men and women who are affected by it. It encourages conversations about dementia beyond whispers in homes or care centers to a wider audience. I believe that if we can change people’s perception of this illness, we can protect those affected from the isolation, support care and research programmes that are inclusive and caring, and create an open dialogue around dementia.

Edith nurtures space, that which sits between breaths, between people, between words. She always loved writing. When she first came to the nursing home she’d often add notes to nurses’ daily journal. What betrayed her, was the fact that her handwriting was so beautiful. 
Who am I and what's my story?
My father, whom I adored was diagnosed with advanced Alzheimers in 2010. A proud, public and intelligent man, he worked hard at hiding his condition, including to us, his family, so to not worry or burden us. Obsessed with secretly understanding my father and what he was going through, my response was to learn all I could about this disease - started reading all I could about the illness, asking doctors questions and even taking online courses, making random connections to the condition everywhere.
One day I read about how Polaroid fades and all the ways people make sure this doesn't happen. I instantly made me think of dementia and how this technology was similar to the illness and how essentially it was a metaphor for the ephemerality of life. In that moment, I imagined a portrait series of people who had Alzheimer's on Polaroid.
In 2015, when my father suddenly passed away and I became a mother shortly after, my series idea haunted me and I had the calling to move it out of my head and finally produce this work - regardless of what came of this work. I am thrilled to be able to show this work in an exhibition for the upcoming September Alzheimers Awareness Month in Brussels. 


What will your contribution support?
I have already self-funded collecting all the portraits and stories. If the campaign is successful, we will develop a beautiful art book of these portraits and these stories (polaroid, words, qoutes, ancedotes and annotations). Our intention is to create a book that feels like an art object, a play on paper, an experience, an extension of the accompanying travelling exhibition. Funds will be used to have the photographs professionally scanned, the book designed and printed, as well the shipping and logistics of the perks. 

If we surpass our goal, this will allow for the exhbit to be translated into other languages than English and for extra copies of the book to be printed and donated to schools, support groups, and nursing homes. We hope that the book will be used as a tool to discuss compassion and care for those with dementia.

If you have suggestions regarding groups, nursing homes, schools, and other organisations we should connect with, please email me.
Why Crowdfunding?
While the What Remains project has always been self-funded, publishing a book is very expensive and requires that I hire others. I also see this crowdfunding campaign, like the book, as a means to engage with a wider audience, open up positive conversations about dementia.

Risks & Challenges
I expect the book to be published by September 2018, but because we are in the early stages of the production process, delays may arise. We have, of course, planned and are doing our outmost to avoid delays. I will regularly update contributors with the status of the project.
Also, given today’s publishing environment, an art book can be a risk. That is why I have decided to distribute the book through this campaign, online and at the galleries where the exhibition will be held. And hopefully at handful of specialized art book shops.Thank you very much for your help! Whether you have pledged or helped to spread the word, your support means a lot!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>
<br/>What is The Monster is on Fire?</h3>
<p>The Monster Is On Fire is a event that is part of the festival of Cerro al Lambro (MI), under the patronage of the Municipality of Cerro al Lambro. In line with the Italian tradition of burning a ""old hag"" made of wood to celebrate the new year, we will celebrate the end of summer with a big bonfire, in which we will burn a mythological monster. It is not the first time we have done this: this will be the fourth event! In the first we roasted the Dragon, in the second Medusa, in the third a Minotaur, last Year the Kraken and now it's time to burn Modran the Treebeard!</p>
<p>To make the event more meaningful, when the bonfire collapses, leaving only the embers on the ground, people will be able to overcome the security cordon and throw into the fire their Monster. This can be clothes , a diary, a photograph or whatever you want!</p>
<p>In addition, based on the availability of volunteers, during the day there will be workshops for juggling, archery and percussion, and whoever wants to can participate freely or help us build the pyre.</p>
<p>Every Year we try to organize a bigger and better event and you can make the difference helping us!</p>

<p>Why contribute?</p>
<p>To help us make The Monster Is On Fire a permanent celebration every year. There is a very important thing that we would like to emphasize:</p>
<p>THE EVENT IS ENTIRELY NON-PROFIT. All cash collected is used to cover the expenses of the fire, to pay the Red Cross and the Firefighters presidiating the event and the choreographic stuff as banquets and diesel fuel for jugglers. </p>
<p>Any excess money will be donated entirely to the Civil Protection and everything will be publicly documented. We would therefore like to make it clear that we gain nothing and we are interested only be able to do the bonfire without losing (too much) money.</p>
<p>As every year we will make a document with the expenses.</p>

<h3>Cos'è The Monster is on Fire?</h3>
<p>The Monster Is On Fire è un'iniziativa inserita all'interno della sagra di Cerro al Lambro (MI) con il patrocinio del Comune di Cerro al Lambro. In linea con la tradizione italiana di bruciare ""la vecchia"" di legna per festeggiare l'anno nuovo, celebreremo la fine dell'estate con un grande falò che rappresenta un mostro mitologico. Non è la prima volta che lo facciamo: siamo già alla quarta edizione! Nella prima abbiamo arrostito il Drago, nella seconda Medusa, nella terza un Minotauro, l'anno scorso il Kraken e quest'anno bruceremo Modren il Barbalbero!</p>
<p>Per rendere l'evento più significativo, quando il falò crollerà e rimarranno solo le braci a terra, a turno le persone potranno superare il cordone di sicurezza e lanciare nel fuoco il proprio Mostro. Può essere un vestito, un diario, una fotografia o quello che volete!</p>
<p>Inoltre, in base alle disponibilità dei volontari, durante il giorno si terranno workshop di giocoleria, tiro con l'arco e percussioni e chiunque vorrà potrà partecipare liberamente oppure aiutarci a costruire la pira.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ogni anno cerchiamo di organizzare un evento migliore e più grande e puoi fare la differenza aiutandoci a renderlo reale!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473845646/tt1ewhdvsrnclym3lgui.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Perché contribuire?</p>
<p>Per aiutarci a rendere The Monster Is On Fire un appuntamento fisso, un momento di ritrovo e di unione. C'è una cosa molto importante che vorremmo sottolineare:</p>
<p>L'EVENTO E' INTERAMENTE NON-PROFIT. Tutti i soldi raccolti servono per coprire le spese del falò, il conto della croce rossa e della protezione civile per averli presenti sul posto e le coreografie come le bancarelle e il gasolio per i giocolieri. </p>
<p>Eventuali soldi eccedenti verrano donati interamente alla Protezione Civile e tutto sarà documentato pubblicamente. Vorremmo quindi che sia chiaro che non guadagneremo nulla e a noi interessa solo poter fare il falò senza perderci (troppo). </p>
<p>Come tutti gli anni faremo un rendiconto delle spese. </p>

HELP US MAKING THE BONFIRE HAPPEN!Meanwhile mark Saturday 24th of September on your calendar and get ready! 
When you do something, you should burn yourself up completely, like a good bonfire, leaving no trace of yourself.

What is The Monster is on Fire?
The Monster Is On Fire is a event that is part of the festival of Cerro al Lambro (MI), under the patronage of the Municipality of Cerro al Lambro. In line with the Italian tradition of burning a ""old hag"" made of wood to celebrate the new year, we will celebrate the end of summer with a big bonfire, in which we will burn a mythological monster. It is not the first time we have done this: this will be the fourth event! In the first we roasted the Dragon, in the second Medusa, in the third a Minotaur, last Year the Kraken and now it's time to burn Modran the Treebeard!
To make the event more meaningful, when the bonfire collapses, leaving only the embers on the ground, people will be able to overcome the security cordon and throw into the fire their Monster. This can be clothes , a diary, a photograph or whatever you want!
In addition, based on the availability of volunteers, during the day there will be workshops for juggling, archery and percussion, and whoever wants to can participate freely or help us build the pyre.
Every Year we try to organize a bigger and better event and you can make the difference helping us!

Why contribute?
To help us make The Monster Is On Fire a permanent celebration every year. There is a very important thing that we would like to emphasize:
THE EVENT IS ENTIRELY NON-PROFIT. All cash collected is used to cover the expenses of the fire, to pay the Red Cross and the Firefighters presidiating the event and the choreographic stuff as banquets and diesel fuel for jugglers. 
Any excess money will be donated entirely to the Civil Protection and everything will be publicly documented. We would therefore like to make it clear that we gain nothing and we are interested only be able to do the bonfire without losing (too much) money.
As every year we will make a document with the expenses.

AIUTACI A RENDERE IL FALO' REALTA'!Intanto segnate sul calendario Sabato 24 Settembre e tenetevi pronti!
Quando si fa qualcosa, si dovrebbe bruciare completamente, come un buon falò, senza lasciare traccia di sé stessi.

Cos'è The Monster is on Fire?
The Monster Is On Fire è un'iniziativa inserita all'interno della sagra di Cerro al Lambro (MI) con il patrocinio del Comune di Cerro al Lambro. In linea con la tradizione italiana di bruciare ""la vecchia"" di legna per festeggiare l'anno nuovo, celebreremo la fine dell'estate con un grande falò che rappresenta un mostro mitologico. Non è la prima volta che lo facciamo: siamo già alla quarta edizione! Nella prima abbiamo arrostito il Drago, nella seconda Medusa, nella terza un Minotauro, l'anno scorso il Kraken e quest'anno bruceremo Modren il Barbalbero!
Per rendere l'evento più significativo, quando il falò crollerà e rimarranno solo le braci a terra, a turno le persone potranno superare il cordone di sicurezza e lanciare nel fuoco il proprio Mostro. Può essere un vestito, un diario, una fotografia o quello che volete!
Inoltre, in base alle disponibilità dei volontari, durante il giorno si terranno workshop di giocoleria, tiro con l'arco e percussioni e chiunque vorrà potrà partecipare liberamente oppure aiutarci a costruire la pira.
 
Ogni anno cerchiamo di organizzare un evento migliore e più grande e puoi fare la differenza aiutandoci a renderlo reale!

Perché contribuire?
Per aiutarci a rendere The Monster Is On Fire un appuntamento fisso, un momento di ritrovo e di unione. C'è una cosa molto importante che vorremmo sottolineare:
L'EVENTO E' INTERAMENTE NON-PROFIT. Tutti i soldi raccolti servono per coprire le spese del falò, il conto della croce rossa e della protezione civile per averli presenti sul posto e le coreografie come le bancarelle e il gasolio per i giocolieri. 
Eventuali soldi eccedenti verrano donati interamente alla Protezione Civile e tutto sarà documentato pubblicamente. Vorremmo quindi che sia chiaro che non guadagneremo nulla e a noi interessa solo poter fare il falò senza perderci (troppo). 
Come tutti gli anni faremo un rendiconto delle spese.

<h3>Here's the skinny!</h3>
<p>I'm DJ Sir Daniel ofAtlanta. I have had the opportunity to DJ for mostly Gay men of color in various safe spaces from adult entertainment to upscale art events. In 2016 I began to create events that would pay homage to iconic musicians and movements in modern Black music and package it to queer people of color because no one else was. After a run of four successful events last year, I went beyond typical day parties and utilized my voice as a DJ to affirm the community.</p>
<p>Artist Ajmal Miller and I (DJ Sir Daniel) are collaborating on an art/music event called ""Prizmatic.""  Ajmal is an accomplished Caribbean carnival costume maker and uses his medium to tell a story of the Diaspora, the Orishas, the contributions of Black men to art &amp; industry while deconstructing the narrative of Black masculinity. As the DJ, I will a provide a sonic backdrop for the evening inspired by Pharrell . We will also take the opportunity to honor the cinematic vision of Hype Williams. The event is taking place at a local art gallery under UV lights (black light.)</p>
<p>Your contributions will allow us to patronize a local art gallery to house the event. Art requires materials and your support will guarantee that Ajmal Miller has the necessary mediums to execute the vision.

<p><b>Brief summary</b></p>
<p>Hi
everyone, my name is Jupiterfab and I'm an Italian artist based in Barcelona,
Spain working on social topics around the world. </p>
<p>I am
here today because I have been invited to a mural festival in Niagara Falls,
Canada, which has been locally held for over 15 years and finally this year
they are opening their doors also to international artists and I feel very
proud to have been invited!</p>
<p>Unfortunately
they do not have that much funds available so they will only be able to cover a
part of the costs of my staying. </p>
<p>I am
here today, hoping you can help me <b>support
the fight against mental health</b>, that being the main topic of the festival.</p>
<p><b>Your financial support will help me covering part of the costs</b>, mainly the travel from Spain to Canada.<b> I
will not receive any salary </b>for this work but I am happy as I believe it is a
great opportunity to be part of such an important cause.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464761196/13220110_10156979345210204_1342649314_n_yo6epv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>The mural and
the Festival </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The<b>
Niagara International</b> <b>Mural Festival (NIMF)</b> is an annual festival focused on
street art taking place in St. Catharines close to Niagara Falls in Ontario, Canada,
from 13<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th </sup>June. It has worked, for over 15 years,
to beautify some degraded parts of the city and to give local and regional artists
an opportunity to express themselves in a big context. This year they decided
to become international but the transition between one period and the other is
not that easy, so that they are struggling a bit in terms of funds and organization.
</p>
<p>For me to
be there, they have been able to cover the costs of paint, scaffolding, meals and
a place to sleep but not travel expenses and any extra cost I may have. </p>
<p></p>
<i></i><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466305614/20160618_144008_icj3ga.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The mural!<p><br/></p>
<p>Despite
the money issue I decided to work with them because they are professional
and genuine and I really like the topic of this year's festival, which is <b>Mental
health</b>. In fact, this year's festival is in collaboration with the St. Catharines
Mental Health Organization. The hashtag of the event is #paintoverthestigma.</p>
<p>My
contribution to the cause will be a mural of 3500 sq. ft depicting the excess
in the use of mobile phones, emphasizing how this fact changes our social and
daily life and how it can generate new social and mental disorders. In order to
generate discussion and make people reflect on it, I will paint a group of
people around a table, alienated by playing endlessly with their cell phone
instead of talking to or interacting with each other.</p>
<p>If I have
your contribution, I will be able to help. <br/></p>

<p><b>Jupiterfab</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>I
work on social art.
I think art can be a strong tool to help society to self-reflect about our way
of life and to support the communities' work. </p>
<p>I focus my observation on the feelings and emotions of
human beings and I depict them in a realistic way, aiming to attract people's
attention, make them stop for a second and reflect on modern society and
consumerism <span>world and how their rules interfere and change rapidly our
habits and our lives, and quite often in a negative way.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>I create murals, paintings and
sound installations but I consider murals the strongest tool to reach audiences
and my favorite media too.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<i>The wall as it will be (the empty wall will be white)</i><br/><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>For the last 10 years, I have been
collaborating with art galleries as well as public and private institutions worldwide,
such as the Court of Justice of Rotterdam, the Barcelona Subway, U of T
(University of Toronto) and several City Halls too.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In fact, during the last 7 years I
have been working on several social projects about marginalized communities
working both on the inside and the outside to improve their situation (check
out the section of my webpage about social projects </span><a href=""http://www.jupiterfab.com/project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.jupiterfab.com/project/</span></a><span>).
Moreover, to make my work more intense and more effective, a couple of years
ago I founded a NGO and put together a team of professionals working on every
single step of a project (preparation, production, logistics, creation,
communication).</span></p>

<i>One of my murals, painted in Richmond, USA in 2015</i><b><br/></b><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Art and social issues</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>As both an artist and a director of a
NGO I constantly work on social issues and, in particular, with marginalized
communities worldwide suffering from different kind of problems: starving, immigration,
integration, gentrification…</p>
<p>This mural is part of a project in which
I immortalize a group of people in an urban context showing the state of
uneasiness behind their masks. </p>
<p>This mural talks about a serious problem
that is getting even more serious every day. The people, and mainly the younger
generations, are starting to have socialization problems, because they live and
are growing up in a society where everything is virtual and fake. </p>
<p>By contributing to this project I hope we
can help people to reflect on this ""virtual society"" we live in and also
help to generate a genuine dialogue about it. </p>
<p>In exchange, I offer my donors some of
my art, from an autographed limited edition postcard to a real painting. I believe
your contribution can be helpful for society and at the same time you will be
able to have a good and unique piece of art for a present ….if you like what I
create, of course!!</p>
<p>Please go ahead, if you feel like it.

</div></div>","Brief summary
Hi
everyone, my name is Jupiterfab and I'm an Italian artist based in Barcelona,
Spain working on social topics around the world. 
I am
here today because I have been invited to a mural festival in Niagara Falls,
Canada, which has been locally held for over 15 years and finally this year
they are opening their doors also to international artists and I feel very
proud to have been invited!
Unfortunately
they do not have that much funds available so they will only be able to cover a
part of the costs of my staying. 
I am
here today, hoping you can help me support
the fight against mental health, that being the main topic of the festival.
Your financial support will help me covering part of the costs, mainly the travel from Spain to Canada. I
will not receive any salary for this work but I am happy as I believe it is a
great opportunity to be part of such an important cause.


The wall I am going to paint over.


The mural and
the Festival 

The
Niagara International Mural Festival (NIMF) is an annual festival focused on
street art taking place in St. Catharines close to Niagara Falls in Ontario, Canada,
from 13th to 19th June. It has worked, for over 15 years,
to beautify some degraded parts of the city and to give local and regional artists
an opportunity to express themselves in a big context. This year they decided
to become international but the transition between one period and the other is
not that easy, so that they are struggling a bit in terms of funds and organization.

For me to
be there, they have been able to cover the costs of paint, scaffolding, meals and
a place to sleep but not travel expenses and any extra cost I may have. 

The mural!
Despite
the money issue I decided to work with them because they are professional
and genuine and I really like the topic of this year's festival, which is Mental
health. In fact, this year's festival is in collaboration with the St. Catharines
Mental Health Organization. The hashtag of the event is #paintoverthestigma.
My
contribution to the cause will be a mural of 3500 sq. ft depicting the excess
in the use of mobile phones, emphasizing how this fact changes our social and
daily life and how it can generate new social and mental disorders. In order to
generate discussion and make people reflect on it, I will paint a group of
people around a table, alienated by playing endlessly with their cell phone
instead of talking to or interacting with each other.
If I have
your contribution, I will be able to help. 




Mural I made in Athens in 2015

Jupiterfab

I
work on social art.
I think art can be a strong tool to help society to self-reflect about our way
of life and to support the communities' work. 
I focus my observation on the feelings and emotions of
human beings and I depict them in a realistic way, aiming to attract people's
attention, make them stop for a second and reflect on modern society and
consumerism world and how their rules interfere and change rapidly our
habits and our lives, and quite often in a negative way.

I create murals, paintings and
sound installations but I consider murals the strongest tool to reach audiences
and my favorite media too.

The wall as it will be (the empty wall will be white)

For the last 10 years, I have been
collaborating with art galleries as well as public and private institutions worldwide,
such as the Court of Justice of Rotterdam, the Barcelona Subway, U of T
(University of Toronto) and several City Halls too.

In fact, during the last 7 years I
have been working on several social projects about marginalized communities
working both on the inside and the outside to improve their situation (check
out the section of my webpage about social projects http://www.jupiterfab.com/project/).
Moreover, to make my work more intense and more effective, a couple of years
ago I founded a NGO and put together a team of professionals working on every
single step of a project (preparation, production, logistics, creation,
communication).



One of my murals, painted in Richmond, USA in 2015
Art and social issues

As both an artist and a director of a
NGO I constantly work on social issues and, in particular, with marginalized
communities worldwide suffering from different kind of problems: starving, immigration,
integration, gentrification…
This mural is part of a project in which
I immortalize a group of people in an urban context showing the state of
uneasiness behind their masks. 
This mural talks about a serious problem
that is getting even more serious every day. The people, and mainly the younger
generations, are starting to have socialization problems, because they live and
are growing up in a society where everything is virtual and fake. 
By contributing to this project I hope we
can help people to reflect on this ""virtual society"" we live in and also
help to generate a genuine dialogue about it. 
In exchange, I offer my donors some of
my art, from an autographed limited edition postcard to a real painting. I believe
your contribution can be helpful for society and at the same time you will be
able to have a good and unique piece of art for a present ….if you like what I
create, of course!!
Please go ahead, if you feel like it.
And if you cannot give any economic contribution, please share this project
with as many friends and people you can. It will be still helpful to the cause.

The challenge and the wish to help

For the last 10 years I have dedicated
my entire life to social art using my experience and my skills as a multinational
ex-manager, trying to go beyond a simple art action but working both within the
community area and outside so to empower them to negotiate a better quality of
life. 
I have chosen a double hard road as, nowadays,
art and social well-being are no easy roads to ride. But I did so. I chose to
quit my job as a manager of one of the most important multinationals in the
motorbike market. I left the benefits and the good salary behind to work on
what I like and, as you can imagine, money has been a constant issue during my career
but at the same time, I had the chance to know many interesting and great
people on my path 
However, I have always found a way to pursue
my dream and how I wanted and I am sure I will be able to make it also for this
project!
So, a bit of sun and positive energy
from Spain!
Thank you in advance

<div>As musicians and artists, it is important for us in the early stages of our professional careers to broaden our horizons whilst at the same time giving back to others by sharing our music through performance or in an educative manner.</div>
<div>In this instance, we have been presented a unique opportunity to collaborate with composers and performers in various countries of the Pacific region, as well as share our own thoughts on music with the students at these institutions we are planning to visit.</div>
<div>With your help, we will be able to share our love and passion for new music with a completely new group of people. Some of which may have not seen music like this before, or who may be interested in engaging in new perspectives of performance practice. Specifically that involving percussion and piano duo repertoire, music for small chamber ensemble, and solo percussion.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising money to support our travel costs from the United States to the Pacific. Since we will be hopping from country to country for a two and a half to three week period, we will also need to be able to afford lodging for the both of us whilst visiting to teach and perform. Our fundraising goal is $6,000.</p>

<p><em>ORAL HISTORY PROJECT:</em></p>
<p>We seek to develop a traveling oral history booth for individuals, couples, families, friends to record stories about their experiences of race, skin tone, and/or sexuality in the formation of their identities.  Our goal is to build an archive of personal stories documenting American History for sharing, teaching, learning, and growing and to offer each participant a FREE copy of their audio recordings.</p>
<p>We are a collection of our stories...and we are writing new chapters every day.  No one can tell your story better than you.

Founded by Carlton Mackey, visual artist and Director of the Ethics & the Arts Initiative at the Emory University Center for Ethics, 50 Shades of Black is committed to exploring the complex relationship between race, skin tone, sexuality, and the formation of identity. Through collaborations with visual artists, scholars and the general public, this project hopes to offer a deeper understanding of what diversity means. It is in the recognition of this diversity that 50 Shades of Black acknowledges the historical role that race and skin tone have played in shaping the way we engage the world, how we perceive beauty, and our own self worth.  Visit www.50shadesofblack.com

Finally, ""the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom."" (Anaïs Nin). With my 4Spitfire to Blossom campaign, I am making this my moment to escape the silencing so common to this type of trauma; to use art, which is central to my own healing journey, to help other women, men, girls, and boys; and to give myself the chance to let my heart, mind, creativity, and soul blossom into a new place and space of healing, growth, and recovery from the tremendous wounding that occurred 44 years ago. Just typing the words “four year old raped,” I could feel my heart constricting, indeed tight, like a bud, and it brings tears to my eyes every time I hear how tiny my voice sounds in the YouTube video of my <em>Phoenix</em> poem (shared for the first time in 2009 at the 9Muses Creativity Café in Fort Lauderdale). Some of this feeling comes from the incomprehensibility of this occurring when I was only four years old, some from the incomprehensible facts that one in four women have been raped and one person is raped or sexually assaulted every four minutes (US DOJ).</p>
<p>Recovering from abuse feels as if I had open heart surgery, but nobody stitched up the wound, leaving it to fester and infect my life. I tried cowboy medicine and poured tons of alcohol on the wound, but it infected my ability to live my life in a way that wasn’t darkly colored by dis-order, dis-ease, disassociation, drunkenness, anger, self-abuse, and addiction. After the debilitating onset of post-traumatic stress disorder and flashbacks in 2000, I used in and outpatient treatment, support groups, and community resources (western medicine, alternative treatments, and anything else I could find) to conquer more than a dozen diagnosed dis-eases. During my journey, several therapeutic practitioners encouraged the use of journaling, creative writing, and collage; opening avenues for healing and blossoming in ways I had never fathomed. In the past four years I have explored the process of sharing, publishing, reading, and entering submissions into juried art shows; the baby steps that got me closer to today and choosing to use the unique platform offered by Indiegogo to end my silence.</p>
<p>With my tiny voice, with the tears I continue to shed, I intend to embrace my nickname, and to spit fire…using my words and art as a catalyst to move past the uncountable walls I have run into in the traditional/dominant health care and justice systems as I have tried to heal. After the disastrous toll PTSD took on my psychological and financial health, most recently I am running into walls while trying to move past the dependency upon the generosity of family with whom I have lived for a number of years. After a highly competitive process I was recently selected for a loft in an artist’s live/work coop studio, but I cannot get a traditional mortgage, probably for at least several more years of cleaning up my credit.</p>
<p>(1) My first goal, through this 4Spitfire campaign, is to purchase a live/work coop studio in which to create the art you are commissioning through your donations and selections of the “perks” I have listed. “A house is not a home unless it contains...fire for the mind as well as the body (Benjamin Franklin).” Playing with the idea of catalysts and spitting fire from hot peppers, all of the perks are designed to continue my process of using art to end the silencing of me and other girls, boys, women, and men who are raped, assaulted, or abused.</p>
<p>(2) My second goal is to launch this campaign today, four days before Valentine’s Day, also known as VDay, to raise awareness about this global movement to end violence against women and girls. <a href=""http://www.vday.org/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.vday.org/home</a></p>
<p>I am using this timing to spark and catalyze my art production to create an entry for an upcoming event called ArtPrize. <a href=""http://www.artprize.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.artprize.org/</a></p>
<p>“Every fall, two thousand artists from around the world invade Grand Rapids, Michigan, to compete for half a million dollars in prizes. Their installations fill the city, from museums and galleries to restaurants, banks, and city parks. During the two and a half week exhibition, the public votes on the winner of a $200,000 prize, while world-renowned jurors select a $100,000 Juried Grand Prize winner, and five $20,000 winners based on categories. New for 2013, ArtPrize is partnering with The Walker in Minneapolis to help fund an ambitious project by a Minnesota artist for a prominent ArtPrize venue. Artists will create proposals for an installation on Gillett Bridge, a highly trafficked pedestrian bridge in the center of ArtPrize.”</p>
<p>I want to use my entry in ArtPrize to contribute to the idea of and movement toward creating a national memorial, one idea for which is being presented on the national mall on VDay: “'The most common trauma of women remains confined to the sphere of private life, without formal recognition or restitution from the community. There is no public monument for rape survivors (Judith Herman, Trauma and Recovery)'.” On VDay this February, FORCE: Upsetting Rape Culture is creating a public memorial for survivors and victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse and rape. During V-DAY’s 1 Billion Rising event, FORCE will float the words I can’t forget what happened but no one else remembers on the reflecting pool of the national mall. The statement, written by a survivor, reflects the isolating and traumatic experience of living with sexual violence. The temporary testament is a public call to create a permanent national monument to honor survivors.” <a href=""http://onebillionrising.org/page/event/detail/startarising/4jvtb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://onebillionrising.org/page/event/detail/startarising/4jvtb</a></p>
<p>(3) Because the internet has such power to surprise, if this campaign exceeds my fundraising goal, I will launch a second phase to raise funds under non-profit status to (a) bring additional therapeutic arts programming to the types of agencies that have been so helpful in my own healing journey and (b) continue raising funds toward a public memorial for survivors and victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse and rape.</p>
<p>Recall that one person is raped or sexually assaulted every four minutes. There are 525,949 minutes in a year, which means that 5,785,439 people were raped or sexually assaulted in the 44 years since I was abused.</p>
<p>Over the years I have given time and written grants and proposals that have raised hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions of dollars for other people, agencies, businesses, programs, and causes. I love that Indiegogo created this new crowd funding platform and hope that you can help me, help us, to end the silence. I am running this campaign for 44 days, to raise $44,444, hoping to provide some of services outlined in my “perks” starting in the fourth month of the year: April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness Month.</p>
<p>I know that some of you can’t contribute, but I would appreciate any help you could give to get the word out via Facebook, Twitter, your email list, any other creative ways you have at your disposal, or by using the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

<p>The foundation has been laid for a dynamic, interactive, world class museum in New York City dedicated to peacebuilding, through education and the arts.  Pasos Peace Museum was established after 9/11 to connect, inspire and empower peacebuilders. Pasos does this through artistic exhibitions, community programs and our Virtual Museum.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>PROJECT BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>We seek your support for our two upcoming month-long exhibits that will be shown in New York City. </p>
<ul>
<li>""A Peace of My Mind"" will open on February 22, 2013.  It is an award-winning collection of photographs and digital recordings derived from interviews of individuals with a wide range of backgrounds and experienes about their thoughts on peace.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>""A Picture of Peace,"" an international photography exhibit showcasing photographs selected through a contest sponsored by the United Network of Young Peacebuilders, will open in June 2013.</li>
</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHY CHOOSE PASOS?</strong></p>
<p>Pasos is a Spanish word meaning steps, crossing or passage.  We believe that Peace is achieved in steps and requires each of us to accept the challenge of reaching our full potential as peacebuilders.  We strive to connect peacebuilders around the world, stimulate their individual and collective imaginations, and take them to the next transformational steps leading to a just and peaceful world.</p>
<p>Pasos Peace Museum has been steadily growing since 2006.  Our most recent milestone was the receipt of a provisional charter as a museum from the State of New York.  We have made inroads, but we still have a long way to go toward achieving our vision of securing a permanent space and becoming the first fully chartered peace museum in New York City.  </p>
<p>Please join us on this exciting journey!  We invite you to visit our website, <a href=""http://www.pasospeacemuseum.org%2C/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pasospeacemuseum.org,</a> to learn more about the Museum and meet our people.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR CONTRIBUTION</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Pasos's immediate goal is to raise $10,000 to cover the costs of the upcoming exhibits.  Your contributions will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rental space</li>
<li>Shipping, insuring and mounting the exhibits</li>
<li>Artist compensation</li>
<li>Development of programs and curricula that will allow New York City school children to access and learn about the exhibits</li>

<p> </p></div>","ABOUT PASOS PEACE MUSEUM
The foundation has been laid for a dynamic, interactive, world class museum in New York City dedicated to peacebuilding, through education and the arts.  Pasos Peace Museum was established after 9/11 to connect, inspire and empower peacebuilders. Pasos does this through artistic exhibitions, community programs and our Virtual Museum.
 
PROJECT BACKGROUND
We seek your support for our two upcoming month-long exhibits that will be shown in New York City. 

""A Peace of My Mind"" will open on February 22, 2013.  It is an award-winning collection of photographs and digital recordings derived from interviews of individuals with a wide range of backgrounds and experienes about their thoughts on peace.

""A Picture of Peace,"" an international photography exhibit showcasing photographs selected through a contest sponsored by the United Network of Young Peacebuilders, will open in June 2013.
 
WHY CHOOSE PASOS?
Pasos is a Spanish word meaning steps, crossing or passage.  We believe that Peace is achieved in steps and requires each of us to accept the challenge of reaching our full potential as peacebuilders.  We strive to connect peacebuilders around the world, stimulate their individual and collective imaginations, and take them to the next transformational steps leading to a just and peaceful world.
Pasos Peace Museum has been steadily growing since 2006.  Our most recent milestone was the receipt of a provisional charter as a museum from the State of New York.  We have made inroads, but we still have a long way to go toward achieving our vision of securing a permanent space and becoming the first fully chartered peace museum in New York City.  
Please join us on this exciting journey!  We invite you to visit our website, www.pasospeacemuseum.org, to learn more about the Museum and meet our people.
 
YOUR CONTRIBUTION
 Pasos's immediate goal is to raise $10,000 to cover the costs of the upcoming exhibits.  Your contributions will be used for:

Rental space
Shipping, insuring and mounting the exhibits
Artist compensation
Development of programs and curricula that will allow New York City school children to access and learn about the exhibits
The success of these exhibits will propel Pasos toward its goals of opening its first home and becoming a fully-charterd peace museum in New York.  Please help us make this happen!
THANK YOU!

<p>Greetings! Welcome to our <strong>BLIND WHINO: SW Arts Club</strong> x <strong>G40 Art Summit </strong>Indiegogo!</p>
<p><em>Our</em><em> main objective in seeking your support flows through two main goals:</em></p>
<p><strong>[GOAL #1]</strong> To raise funds for continued improvements to the 138 year old building nestled in Southwest Washington DC in our Nations Capitol. Although we have cleaned up the building and commissioned two amazing artists to paint the Exterior (HENSE - ATL) and Interior (MEGGS - AUS) of the building there is still quite a bit to do. We need to further improve the building with items such as painting on resin floors, bringing in 20 additional artists to paint the exhibit halls and project spaces, changing of light fixtures, repairing of the roof and items of the like.</p>
<p><strong>[GOAL #2] </strong>Once our goal is met to solidify all cosmetics within the space we can initiate the second phase which is to raise funds for additional programing at our annual G40 Art Summit held in September 2013.  We are planning to do a full lineup of programming throughout the month to bring residents from DC, Maryland and Virginia down to the Southwest Waterfront. Programming will consist of Art Related Events, Musical Performances and Art Workshops. We are also planning a Private Fundraising Concert with special celebrity guests hosts and musical entertainment to help fund our project. </p>

<p>The success of this initial intervention was followed by the recently completed mural by Australian artist <strong>MEGGS</strong>. This second project brings life to the interior of the building with its graphic primary colors and colossal scale. Now that there is life both inside and out, the building will be a inspirational beacon for patrons within the DC region to come to the space and be overwhelmed with Art in a scale unlike anything seen before.</p>

<h1><strong>About G40 2013:</strong></h1>
<p>Art Whino will be teaming up with Suite Nation to present a month-long, multi- experiential Art Summit with extensive art programming and musical performances throughout the exhibition month.  This year’s theme is the “Art of Transformation” and the exploration of reclaimed spaces and objects. These will range from using found objects to create art installations, to transforming the space using artwork. The location of G40 Arts Summit this year will be an awe inspiring experience, as every inch is an all surrounding work of art. The building itself has a rich background. Completed by James A. Boyce over a 12-year period in 1875, it exhibits an eclectic Victorian style with Romanesque, Gothic Revival, and Queen Anne elements.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>2 years ago this May 7<sup>th</sup>.  My wife came very close to dying during the birth of our son.  After just under a month in multiple hospitals she was able to come home to see our new family.  In speaking with her months later about the events, she mentioned that the biggest helper in her surviving something that should have killed her (Her liver ruptured) was all the people around us visiting, Calling, Texting, Sending Cards, etc.   She told me,  "" I had no idea so many people loved me.""</p>
<p> I have always painted her something special for random occasions as a way to show her I love her in a unique way.  For the 2nd anniversary of my wife being given a second chance at life, as well as my sons 2nd birthday I want to do something AMAZING. </p>
<p> I plan to paint my wife something that can capture peoples love not just locally.  I will use this funding from people that understand the power love can bring and how amazing it is to paint her LIFE ANNIVERSARY painting.  This way every time she looks at it, she will be reminded that love is strong.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My goal is that I can finally upgrade from the warped slab canvas's I have been using.  To an actual deep stretched canvas.  I want this to be something in my family for generations. </li>
<li>To upgrade to real paintbrushes.  I have been using old hand me downs and other random objects that seem to be able to hold paint.</li>
<li>I want to start using oil paints instead of acrylic.</li>
<li>I can't wait to take photos of the process to send to those who are able to support my cause.  To share with you all the unveiling of this ""group"" art masterpiece to my precious  wife</li>
<li>If I am unable to meet the entire goal that is ok.  A dollar helps me prove that Love is strong and the message will not be lost.  All the money I am able to raise goes purely into the purchase of supplies, which means I will be painting no matter what.  The goal of this is the message behind it.</li>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my campaign</p></div>","Short Summary
2 years ago this May 7th.  My wife came very close to dying during the birth of our son.  After just under a month in multiple hospitals she was able to come home to see our new family.  In speaking with her months later about the events, she mentioned that the biggest helper in her surviving something that should have killed her (Her liver ruptured) was all the people around us visiting, Calling, Texting, Sending Cards, etc.   She told me,  "" I had no idea so many people loved me.""
 I have always painted her something special for random occasions as a way to show her I love her in a unique way.  For the 2nd anniversary of my wife being given a second chance at life, as well as my sons 2nd birthday I want to do something AMAZING. 
 I plan to paint my wife something that can capture peoples love not just locally.  I will use this funding from people that understand the power love can bring and how amazing it is to paint her LIFE ANNIVERSARY painting.  This way every time she looks at it, she will be reminded that love is strong.
What We Need & What You Get

My goal is that I can finally upgrade from the warped slab canvas's I have been using.  To an actual deep stretched canvas.  I want this to be something in my family for generations. 
To upgrade to real paintbrushes.  I have been using old hand me downs and other random objects that seem to be able to hold paint.
I want to start using oil paints instead of acrylic.
I can't wait to take photos of the process to send to those who are able to support my cause.  To share with you all the unveiling of this ""group"" art masterpiece to my precious  wife
If I am unable to meet the entire goal that is ok.  A dollar helps me prove that Love is strong and the message will not be lost.  All the money I am able to raise goes purely into the purchase of supplies, which means I will be painting no matter what.  The goal of this is the message behind it.
The Impact
I hope that whether or not I reach my goal, everyone who does donate is a believer that love IS strong.  My wife and I are firmly believe that she would not have survived had she not actually been able to FEEL the love those around her have for her.
My hope would be that just by you visiting this campaign you will be reminded of the benefit we can have on those around us.  We all have people around us that although may not be in need of urgent medical attention.  They may still be able to benefit from feeling a little extra love today.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am WoolWench. Friends know me as Suzy. I am a fiber artist and yarn spinner. I currently sell all the yarn I produce via my online Etsy shop, which can be found at: <a href=""http://www.woolwench.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.woolwench.com</a></p>
<p>I first started spinning when my daughter was a small baby, that was 17 years ago! Wow. And guess what, I am still using the same wonderful spinning wheel that I learned on. My goal now though, is to raise enough funds to purchase the fabulous Majacraft Aura Spinning Wheel (the ONE wheel to rule them all!), a wheel specifically designed to manage both traditional and mega art yarns! With it, I plan to take my creative art yarn spinning to the next level, while continuing to make wonderful functional yarn of great quality for knitters, crocheters, felters, and fiber artists all over the globe. Additionally, I would like to raise enough to make at least the minimum wholesale order of fibers, then I will be able to create even more wonderous yarns of all kinds as well as send you fabulous supporters the super perk skeins planned for you!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span>In a nutshell? Simple :) I need $1390 to purchase the Aura spinning Wheel.  To also allow me to straight away start with these extra special yarns I am planning to send to supporters, I also need to raise the $265 required to make a minimum wholesale order of fleece which I can then dye, and spin on the new wheel! Following the production of 'perk yarns' I will be working hard to increase my standard yarn range to include all sorts of wonderful fluffy and textured art yarns, which will be exhibited and sold through my online shop. I want to create this range as distinctive to me. I already have a strong branding for my yarns through the  unique and super high quality photos I make to showcase my yarn, however I want to now go a step further and start building a range of unique to me techniques, yet to be invented :) The Aura wheel will give me a lot more freedom to be inventive and follow my ideas to a final product on this ONE wheel!</span></p>
<p><span>If I am only able to raise partial funding, dont worry, if there is enough for the wheel only, I can still supply you with your wonderful yarns with retail sourced fiber! If I raise enough only for the wholesale fiber order, dont worry, I can still use my trusty old wheel to produce the reward yarns! So whatever happens, if you help out with at least $25+ you will get a beautiful yarn just as promised :) Please note, delivery outside of Europe takes an extra week or two from the estimated delivery dates listed with the perks!</span></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE to perks! </strong></p>
<p>Here's a small addition to the 'Perks' available for supporters! I realise not everyone really wants yarn, so as an alternative, if you want to spin your own, or if you want to do something else like wet or needle felting, I also make drum carded fiber batts - So if you would prefer a batt as your perk, just leave me a note to tell me your preference and I will send you a batt instead! A $25 donate will get you one yummy batt and a $50 donate comes with two batts! And I might even throw in a little something extra as a surprise :) (for examples have a look in my Etsy shop <a href=""http://www.woolwench.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.woolwench.com</a> -also in the 'sold' section)</p>
<p>And remember, I ship all perks worldwide at my cost! So even though you can certainly buy through my Etsy shop anytime, donating on my campaign is going to save you $$, and some of the yarns I am making are exclusive to this mission, so extra special :)</p>

<h3>Heres the story of the One Wheel (in case you were wondering!)</h3>
<p>In the dark time before handmade became known to all, before knitting and crochet was released from the drudgery of granny squares and itchy socks, the great wizard Majacraft created many spinning wheels with the power to create yarn, he released them into the world, where they were taken up by many, spreading the power of handmade far and wide. But he knew, they were lacking, their yarns were beautiful but missing the final creative force that would take yarn and its users to the next level. Humanity, and the fibers we used, started slipping back into the dark times, the hippies and earthchildren creating their earthforce yarns lost their souls and gave in to the mighty power of Massproducagon. These times were known only as 'the eighties' and they lasted several decades. But now, there is a new light in the world. The great wizard Majacraft could not let the world suffer under the constraints of yarns limited by orifice sizes and snaggy hooks, he joined forces with the incredible Pluckyfluff, legend among sheep and revolutionary bringer of a new age of yarnish enlightenment. Together they created The One Wheel, which they named 'Aura'. This wheel was destined to rule them all. Together, Majacraft and Pluckyfluff gave this wheel the power to take fibers and turn them into art, incorporating other objects of power into the yarn in a way never before seen.  With this wheel it became possible to spin amulets into the fibers, to create twists, knots, spin entire sheep into a creation of great wonder, a creation which would bring the dulled and uniformed humanity back to the art of needlecraft, wool art, natural fibers, and revitalise handmade, sending Massproducagon back into the crater of mediocrity.</p>
<p><strong>WoolWench i</strong>s part of this journey, striving to create inspirational yarns and artworks in fiber. She saw these wonderful creations that Pluckyfluff released into the world, and was inspired. She understood Majacraft, and felt drawn to the Aura, created in the very land where she was born and to which she was spiritually tied, and she instantly saw an expression of her potential in the spin of this wheel.  The Aura contains the power of her connection to the land and the forest, the spirit of Tane Mahuta, forest god, reflected in the rich colour of the Rimu wood used to give it form. </p>

<h1><em><strong>Ciao!</strong></em></h1>
</div></div>","Lingua Parla is a website that allows you to learn to speak any language for FREE, by connecting you with native speakers.
 


 
Whether you're just starting out in your secondary language, almost fluent, but need more practice or you just need someone to talk to so you don't lose it, Lingua Parla is YOUR solution.
I’ve spent much of the last six years trying to find the best way to learn a new language. While there are many great ways of building vocabulary, memorizing conjugations and all-around filling your mind with useful information, absolutely nothing beats the experience and acquisition of knowledge that can be accomplished by speaking with a native speaker.
You'll be matched with the right people to advance your learning. In addition, you can search the chat rooms for someone to practice and strike up a conversation with (at their consent, of course).
Your payment to the other person is time: The person to whom you’re talking is also there to learn a secondary language (we matched them to you because you speak the language they want to learn). Each conversation will last 15 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour or whatever the two people agree upon.

I have a passion for making art, especially art that has that the power to make a positive impact in the world. One issue that has always been close to my heart is the injustice of human trafficking. For my senior project I’ll be exploring this social justice issue further by creating 3-D multi-media pieces paired with graphic prints. I hope to create pieces that provoke an intense emotional experience that becomes personal to viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong></p>
<p>I want to make this project really awesome so it makes a lasting impression on viewers to the point where they are moved/inspired to do something to stop it. In order to make this project a reality I’m asking for funding in the amount of $2,750. This goes towards tools, materials, print services and other specialty craftsman services. If I don’t reach my goal all the funds will still go toward this but the piece itself won’t be as awesome as I originally envisioned.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact </strong></p>
<p>I don’t want to say that if you contribute to my campaign you’ll be stopping human trafficking. I do believe that knowledge is power and the fact that were saying it’s a problem hopefully will inspire more people to join the fight. This piece will be on display at Pacific Lutheran University so the minds of tomorrow and the public will interact with it. Personally, I’d like to imagine this project creating larger possibilities, like inspiring the next major human rights activist or connecting the right people at the right time to stop another human sale from occurring.  <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Other Ways to Help</strong></p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated. If you can’t help out financially just promoting this project (utilize the Indiegogo share tools) or the injustices of human trafficking in general is an enormous help!</p>

The idea is simple.  We want a coloring book that highlights the local justice work we support as a childcare collective, and embraces the values of love and liberation that inform our childcaring.  So we decided to make one!

The Chicago Childcare Collective is a group of volunteers who play with kids to support parent and caregivers' participation in racial and economic justice organizing in the city.

Coloring is such a calming, fun, important part of childcare.  We want to make the most of our time with kids by having coloring pages with extra special meaning.

We started dreaming about this project over a year ago, put out a call for submissions in November, and after tons of community input we're ready to print!


By contributing to our campaign, you'll have the chance to be a part of this community-driven project to bring stories of resistance and empowerment in Chicago to kids and people with crayons.  What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise funds for printing, and you need to make sure you can get a copy.  These are gonna go quick!

We're ordering 300 copies from Tampico Press in Pilsen for $575.  But since Indiegogo takes out some fees, and we need postage money for the perks, we're trying to raise $650!

Once printed, we will be distributing books for a sliding scale rate, and a link to download the pages will be made available on our blog.




Any funds raised above printing costs will go to support kid and family participation at the 2014 Allied Media Conference!


You really want to be a part of this.  Really.
Over 35 artists submitted pages.  
7 people translated the entire book so that it can be accessible in English and Spanish.  
An incredibly talented artist and designer edited the entire book and made our cover.  
An all volunteer editing team has been curating the book for months.  And some of the captions are real clever.
Several of our pages were already featured in the most recent issue of AREA Chicago: Childhoods, along with a story of how the coloring book came to be.

<p>That’s right! Popular art and mass media imagery are new
frontiers in the field of the visual arts, as well as in Museum galleries. Scholars
and the general public alike are beginning to pick up on the significance of casual
art created for consumer use. Think about it—what better way to study the formation
and function of mass ideas and beliefs of a given place, time, or culture than
through the art that was produced for large-scale consumption and broad enjoyment by
the public? What better way to understand how the American West became the Wild
West we cherish than through the very images that formed and reinforced this

This October, the Old West and the New West will collide at
the Tucson Museum of Art! A one-of-a-kind exhibition—Western Heroes of Pulp
Fiction—will use art from comic books, pulp fiction novels, dime novels, and
magazine and book illustrations to explore the ways in which mass media images
of the Wild West have built and reinforced its status as the American land of
legends. In fact, we dare say that this exhibition is the first of its kind in
terms of media, scope, and focus. Interested? Here is the exciting part—YOU can
be a lasting part of this historic exhibition by helping us get its catalogue
published!
   Comic Books? At an Art Museum? 
That’s right! Popular art and mass media imagery are new
frontiers in the field of the visual arts, as well as in Museum galleries. Scholars
and the general public alike are beginning to pick up on the significance of casual
art created for consumer use. Think about it—what better way to study the formation
and function of mass ideas and beliefs of a given place, time, or culture than
through the art that was produced for large-scale consumption and broad enjoyment by
the public? What better way to understand how the American West became the Wild
West we cherish than through the very images that formed and reinforced this
world of tall tales and legends?
You know the wonder and imaginative awe these images
provoke, as well as the deep nostalgia and meaning they hold. Maybe you grew up
watching Rio Bravo with your grandfather during the holidays or played along
with the Lone Ranger. Maybe you are a graphic designer with a love of classic
Western illustrators which inspires you in your daily work. Maybe your Dad hums
the tune of the Rawhide theme while he’s busy and quotes John Wayne
when he’s feeling feisty. Or, maybe YOU have the greatest collection of Jonah
Hex comics on the planet and attend every steampunk convention in America. If
you fall into any of these categories, or any space in between, this exhibition

<p><i>Ski is a Rock n' Roll photographer, Nora is an artist. He's American, she's Hungarian. They are destined to be together, even though now they are a world apart.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/453971/files/20140323104550-SkiNori2.png?1395596750"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><font color=""grey""><b>About Ski</b></font></h3>
<blockquote><font color=""a6a6a6""><i>If there was one phrase that would fit Ski perfectly, it would be ""Rock n' Roll Paparazzi"". <font color=""ff2376"">His greatest talent is to capture the essence of a moment in such a way, that it makes you feel you were there right beside him when he'd taken his photos.</font> Ever since he was a child, his love for music has been a defining factor for Ski. Growing up in Newport Beach, CA, his instant draw towards early punk rock was accompanied with his profound interest in photography at the age of 15. Even at that young age he already knew his purpose in life. By the time he turned 18 years, Ski was living in Los Angeles on his own, more often than not in the back of his station wagon, relentlessly pursuing what was to become his greatest passion: concert photography. For over a decade, Ski has been living in Las Vegas, NV, and continues to be well-loved and highly appreciated in rock n' roll circles for not only his outstanding photography skills, but also his charming, vibrant personality. Over the years Ski has mastered the art of studio photography, and has also developed as an artist. But whatever he does, he continues to rebel against conventional creative concepts. All of his photos and artwork are unique and ""follow the beat of his punk rock heart"".</i></font></blockquote>
<h3><font color=""grey""><b>About Nora</b></font></h3>
<blockquote><font color=""a6a6a6""><i>If Nora - or Nori, as she's known by her friends - had to use a single phrase to describe herself, she wouldn't necessarily choose the word ""artist"", much to Ski's annoyance. She was born and raised in Budapest, Hungary, and ever since she was a child, she has found great pleasure in drawing and painting, and her excellent art teachers in school only fueled her passion for creativity. Having worked in Communications and Public Relations for many years, her artistic ambitions took a backseat for a while, but after a long pause, she once again picked up a pencil in the summer of 2011 and - inspired by her lifelong love for rock music - started drawing her favorite rock stars. She has never looked back ever since: in the past three years Nora has put great effort into perfecting and evolving her techniques, constantly practicing and keen on learning, sometimes venturing from rock music towards other directions. Never having been a trained artist, only recently did she start taking up drawing classes, in order to finally have the opportunity to work with live models.

Ski is a Rock n' Roll photographer, Nora is an artist. He's American, she's Hungarian. They are destined to be together, even though now they are a world apart.

About Ski
If there was one phrase that would fit Ski perfectly, it would be ""Rock n' Roll Paparazzi"". His greatest talent is to capture the essence of a moment in such a way, that it makes you feel you were there right beside him when he'd taken his photos. Ever since he was a child, his love for music has been a defining factor for Ski. Growing up in Newport Beach, CA, his instant draw towards early punk rock was accompanied with his profound interest in photography at the age of 15. Even at that young age he already knew his purpose in life. By the time he turned 18 years, Ski was living in Los Angeles on his own, more often than not in the back of his station wagon, relentlessly pursuing what was to become his greatest passion: concert photography. For over a decade, Ski has been living in Las Vegas, NV, and continues to be well-loved and highly appreciated in rock n' roll circles for not only his outstanding photography skills, but also his charming, vibrant personality. Over the years Ski has mastered the art of studio photography, and has also developed as an artist. But whatever he does, he continues to rebel against conventional creative concepts. All of his photos and artwork are unique and ""follow the beat of his punk rock heart"".
About Nora
If Nora - or Nori, as she's known by her friends - had to use a single phrase to describe herself, she wouldn't necessarily choose the word ""artist"", much to Ski's annoyance. She was born and raised in Budapest, Hungary, and ever since she was a child, she has found great pleasure in drawing and painting, and her excellent art teachers in school only fueled her passion for creativity. Having worked in Communications and Public Relations for many years, her artistic ambitions took a backseat for a while, but after a long pause, she once again picked up a pencil in the summer of 2011 and - inspired by her lifelong love for rock music - started drawing her favorite rock stars. She has never looked back ever since: in the past three years Nora has put great effort into perfecting and evolving her techniques, constantly practicing and keen on learning, sometimes venturing from rock music towards other directions. Never having been a trained artist, only recently did she start taking up drawing classes, in order to finally have the opportunity to work with live models. Her artworks range from portraits to landscapes, from pencil drawings to oil paintings, always with a special emphasis on elaborate details. She readily admits, however, that her forte has always been drawing portraits, ever since she was in high school. Being able to capture the emotions of her models and make their features - especially their eyes - come alive on paper is what she considers the greatest reward and accomplishment for herself. Ever since she's known him, Nora considers Ski to be one of the strongest inspirations not just in her life, but in her art as well.
How And When...
...did we meet, you might ask? Well,on Facebook (of all places!) almost a year ago, inadvertently thanks to our mutual friend and rock musician Todd ""Dammit"" Kerns. Nora asked for Ski's permission to base a new drawing of hers on one of Ski's photos of Todd... and he jumped at the chance to say a big YES, because as soon as he saw her profile picture, he knew that he had to get to know her... and the rest is
now history, or so they say.
It was art, photography, and rock music that brought us together in the first place, almost one year ago, so it's only fitting that it should bring us even closer, this time in the physical sense. Going 5997 miles for a first kiss doesn't seem much when two people love each other as much as we do, but unfortunately with life throwing us curves it has so far been impossible to put aside money for a return ticket either to Las Vegas or to Budapest, Hungary. After countless collaborations and endless hours of chats and Skype dates we are surer than ever that we want to be together, and at the moment the only way we can make the first step towards that is to offer you our labor of love.
We're giving up one-of-a-kind photos, artwork, and some very special memorabilia to raise enough money to be able to finally meet for the first time.
What We Need & What You Get
We set our goal at 1500 USD, which would cover one return ticket to Las Vegas for Nora, and a short road trip to California to visit Ski's mom together. Anything we get above that amount would go into a return ticket to Budapest for Ski's visit later this year. Naturally, even if we don't reach our goal, the funds will be put aside for the same purpose; it just means that we would need to wait a little longer to finally meet. Needless to say, it's getting harder and harder to be apart with each
day...
So what do we have for you in return for your contribution? A whole range of goodies, and there is more to come each week!
Our Perks Are:


If you don't have the money to buy anything, but still would want to contribute, you can pledge for a special ""Thank You"" Video message or a ""Thank You"" Post Card from us. It's guaranteed that we will pour our hearts and souls into them!


If you are looking into having a high-quality Original Photo Print, you can choose from a selection of unique R'n'R shots (all of them taken by Ski himself, of course) of legendary musicians such as James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Lemmy Kilmister, Joey Ramone, Dave Navarro, Scott Ian, James Brown, Sebastian Bach, Rob Zombie, the Sin City
Sinners, and many more.


Nora also has a range of original drawings, of which you can get yourself beautiful prints to go on your wall.


But if you are interested in buying original artwork, she has a selection of her drawings available for that purpose. Her subjects are quite famous, too...


What is more, she would love to draw a custom portrait for you, if that's what your heart desires. Now it doesn't matter who the subject(s) is/are, or what the size of the drawing is (limited up to A1 only for shipping purposes), it comes at a fixed price!


Our friend, and in a sense the person responsible for us getting to know each other, Todd Kerns - Canadian musician who played in Age of Electric, Static In Stereo, Las Vegas's very own Sin City Sinners, and currently in Slash feat. Myles Kennedy And The Conspirators - was so kind as to sign for us a few exclusive photos that Ski took of him, which are now up for grabs - two prints of each photo! 


If you are living in or near Las Vegas, and you have been toying with the idea of having a professional photo shoot for yourself, your partner, your child, etc. (at a reasonable price), here is your chance to get it done by Ski. If you want to have it Rock n' Roll style, even better! If you have any questions for him about this perk, feel free to post them in the Comments section!

Of course there will be more brand new perks coming up every week, so keep an eye on this page!
When Will You Get Your Perks?


The video and the post cards will be sent all the way from Las Vegas, so
sometime during the summer months, hopefully in July/early August.


The photos, prints, and drawings will be mailed to you by early June the latest (as soon as they are ready for shipping).


For the photo shoot you and Ski will need to set a date together.



Your Contribution Will...
...help us realize a dream that has played a vital part of our lives for every single day of the past year. With your help we will be able to hold each other, kiss each other, and after so much time spent on Skype, look each other in the eye for the first time.

Also, beyond our personal happiness, we would be absolutely delighted if you gave any of our artwork a loving new home. For two people who love to create and appreciate art and beauty as much as we do, your finding pleasure in our creations is a source of happiness in itself.

My decompression time usually lasted a week or so. After the 2013 burn, I had no withdrawals,  I was so pumped up with excitement to begin this project and It only took a week for me to acquire the vehicle.   I remember trying to explain this ""Mayan Temple"" to a very close friend as I was telling her how this whole vision came to light and so I  jumped on my computer and started to do a  Google search for images.  It took some time, I mean, doing a search for ""Burning Man"" and ""temple"",  you'll get a return of 25 years of 
the actual Temples but very, very few of this particular art 
structure.   <br/></p><p>We learned the ""Mayan"" Temple had a name:  ""Temple of Kukulkan"" and  finally found a picture, a random photographer by the name Arin Fishkin had an amazing album of images from the 2013 burn<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/arinfish/9678513665/in/set-72157635375243180"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/arinfish/9678513665/in/set-72157635375243180"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Photographer Arin Fishkin's Burning Man 2013 Album</a>   <br/>I was showing the image to my friend and  began to zoom in, reminiscing and admiring the image that Miss Fishkin had captured....and that's when I received the shock of my life......  Miss Fishkin actually captured the MOMENT!!! That 30 seconds of clarity when I became one with the Playa, that moment that I had the vision.  What are the chances?  I am still blown away.....

My decompression time usually lasted a week or so. After the 2013 burn, I had no withdrawals,  I was so pumped up with excitement to begin this project and It only took a week for me to acquire the vehicle.   I remember trying to explain this ""Mayan Temple"" to a very close friend as I was telling her how this whole vision came to light and so I  jumped on my computer and started to do a  Google search for images.  It took some time, I mean, doing a search for ""Burning Man"" and ""temple"",  you'll get a return of 25 years of 
the actual Temples but very, very few of this particular art 
structure.   We learned the ""Mayan"" Temple had a name:  ""Temple of Kukulkan"" and  finally found a picture, a random photographer by the name Arin Fishkin had an amazing album of images from the 2013 burnPhotographer Arin Fishkin's Burning Man 2013 Album   I was showing the image to my friend and  began to zoom in, reminiscing and admiring the image that Miss Fishkin had captured....and that's when I received the shock of my life......  Miss Fishkin actually captured the MOMENT!!! That 30 seconds of clarity when I became one with the Playa, that moment that I had the vision.  What are the chances?  I am still blown away..... I have yet to meet Miss Fishkin, but when and if I do, big hugs and a huge thank you will be had :-)As I was doing more research I discovered another ""Are you kidding me?"" moment.     I've been wanting to attend Burning man for at least 10 years prior to my eventual first burn in 2010, but there was always something that prevented me.   When I finally received a gifted ticket to the 2010 Burn I knew the life I had known would forever be changed!   This is the first picture that was taken of me when I received my ticket ""home""..happy guy huh? :                                        What's the Significance? Ready for this?  The design of the 2010 Burning Man Metropolis Ticket was created by..... Yup......Arin Fishkin!!!!!  http://arinfishkin.com/burning_man_ticket_2010.html......... just another ""power of the Playa"" moment.  -Mike C""Justin Case""",7.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<h3>The collaboration</h3>
<p>The poetry in ""Getting To Know You"" describes Christopher's experience of discovering Vancouver. Anyone acquainted with this city will find familiar landmarks, vistas, and situations in these poems. After 5 years of living here, our poet operates somewhere between ""outsider"" and ""seasoned citizen."" He is still becoming a Vancouverite. And as such, he is in a perfect position to comment on Vancouver becoming a bigger version of itself, and on the in-between spaces that this growth produces. Here is an exploration of the stillness and solitude that exists within the frenetic, electric pace of the city. These poems recount the drastic changes we impose upon our urban environment, and concurrently, the subtle ways in which we are changed by it.</p>
<p>Over the course of six months, Sigrid visited the locations of the poems to collect sketches and photographs. Although she has created many drawings in her lifetime, this is her first attempt at copper plate etching. She has been trying all kinds of techniques including hard ground, drypoint, aquatint, burnishing, scraping, and soft ground lift. Her strong attention to detail, and her mastery of line and shadow translate beautifully to the copper plate, resulting in some rich pieces of art. Sigrid has chosen her favourite long vertical format for her etchings, and this goes particularly well with the subject of the poems.</p>
<p>Our book covers will be printed on custom designed paper made by local paper maker, Reg Lissel. The poems will be printed on a Vandercook Universal I, from polymer plates created at Blackstone Press. We electroplate our copper plates with steel. These will be printed on a Takach etching press onto Arches Text Wove etching paper. All printing and book binding will be done at New Leaf Editions on Granville Island.<br/></p>

Her strong attention to detail, and her mastery of line and shadow translate beautifully to the copper plate, resulting in some rich pieces of art. Sigrid has chosen her favourite long vertical format for her etchings, and this goes particularly well with the subject of the poems.
Our book covers will be printed on custom designed paper made by local paper maker, Reg Lissel. The poems will be printed on a Vandercook Universal I, from polymer plates created at Blackstone Press. We electroplate our copper plates with steel. These will be printed on a Takach etching press onto Arches Text Wove etching paper. All printing and book binding will be done at New Leaf Editions on Granville Island.

All funds raised will go towards the cost of materials.
Any extra funds raised will be divided between the collaborators.

</p><p>As many of you know, for the past year I have been studying and performing contemporary Butoh dance in New York City. I have performed solo Butoh-inspired performance pieces throughout the city, and have been training regularly and guest performing with the <a href=""www.vangeline.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vangeline Theater</a>, an esteemed Butoh dance company based in New York. It has been a wonderful expansion of my physical theater and performance background, and I am honored to be able to share my evolving work with others. </p>
<p>My theatrical and movement-based roots in Atlanta, Italy, and Chicago have all influenced my work to this point, and I am beyond excited to explore my art more deeply. I was recently afforded the opportunity to present two new solo works in Berlin, Germany, as part of the city's annual Month of Performance Art (MPA-B 2015). Along with several other Hispanic/Latin identified artists working under the name <a href=""http://performeandousa.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PERFORMEANDO</a>, I will be performing work at three locations between May 27 and June 2. I am incredibly humbled by this chance to share myself with a larger audience, but, like many artists in this country, I am unfortunately not in a financial position to afford the logistical costs on my own.</p>
<p>I am terrible at asking for help, but at this point in my career, I am unable to cover the cost of this trip independently. The funds raised here will help cover the cost of travel, lodging, and meals, pay my sound designer, and assist with costuming. No amount is too small and even just spreading the word and sharing this campaign with friends and family would be incredibly helpful. </p>
<p>Any money raised beyond my basic costs will go directly to further training in New York as well as to helping bolster my presence as an artist in the city (website creation, etc.)</p>
<p>I am so grateful for any help, and in exchange for your kind donations, I have created a few incentives (tarot readings, hugs, tears of gratitude, etc.).
