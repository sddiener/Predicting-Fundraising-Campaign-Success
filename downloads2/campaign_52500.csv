<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong><i>Driver</i></strong>, <i> A noir-style web series starring Rhett Johnson.</i>  Rhett brings intensity, talent and good looks; Damon Wood brings a vision, a script, relationships with craftsmen and actors, and a track record of finishing projects. <i> Driver </i> is no vanity project. Our goal is to create a quality series that deals with the middle age condition and provides some new actors of all ages and races a chance to do something other than stand in the background or do limited ""48 hour-style"" projects.  The story is full of characters at the apex of their crises.  <i>Driver </i> is fast-paced, taut, gritty and stylish.  Above all, the show is close-up and almost uncomfortably so.  Like the confines of a car, this story has very little leg room.</p>
<p>The pilot episode is to be funded in part by this campaign. Directed by Damon Wood, who brings over 20 years of independent film and video production, and starring Rhett Johnson, a professional actor based in Atlanta, Georgia,<i> Driver </i> is certainly not G-rated, but it is discreet. Many of the characters' lives hang in the balance and discretion is their only friend.  Sexy?  Yes.  Gritty? Yes.  Gratuitous? No.  It is a world only exposed through the eyes of the Driver, who unfortunately cannot understand the danger of his choices until it is too late.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Written as a web series, <i>Driver </i> is 13 episodes, culminating in the death of The Driver, its main character. It is finite. One story of many stories, some significant and some simply interesting, humorous or misleading. Full of suspense, action and a pathos for the down-trodden, <i>Driver </i> is about a fractured life-- one that must end rather than be fixed.</p>
<p>We need $ 5,000.  What for? Here:</p>
<ul>
<li>To pay actors</li>
<li>To pay craftsmen and women (hair/mua, grips, pa's, artists, etc.)</li>
<li>To acquire graphic art</li>
<li>Creation of series website</li>
<li>To arrange music and sound effects</li>
<li>To promote and raise funding for the resulting series</li>
</ul>
<p>That amount, $ 5000, won't really pay for a genuine quality series pilot.  Nope.  The partners will need to contribute three times that in time, equipment, locations, post-production and legal work,  But it will insure that actors and workers get paid up front (not in that elusive ""back end"") for their toil.</p>
<p>And what do you, the patron, get for your donations, aside from the satisfaction of seeing a new, interesting entertainment product?  Here:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ 10 The Hitchhiker- Gets a personalized thank you and Production Still</li>
<li>$ 25 Rider -  Also gets a digital download of the pilot</li>
<li>$ 50  Easy Rider - Also gets a Driver T-shirt</li>
<li>$ 100 Repeat Offender - gets the T-shirt and Special Thanks Credit and invitations to the Premiere</li>
<li>$ 500 gets all that and a cameo in the pilot, you can even die if you want to!</li>
<li>Greater amounts will land you as a Producer and we need to talk!</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the pilot script, $ 5,000 would break down into $ 385 per page of the script.  That's to get actors, MUA, PA's, crew members, locations, transportation, props, craft services and other up-front costs. Considering the small, tight independent action/suspense production that is planned, the actually per page cost would be in the neighborhood of $ 750 - $ 1000 per page.  I am pledging to get that done.  I'm simply asking for help, whatever help you can afford.  I promise that your money will be spent on employing others.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will put creative people to work. This project is more than just about ""getting it done.""  We want to launch careers.  We want to entertain.  We want to make a story that is compelling, keeps you guessing, sets expectations and then WHAM! blows your mind.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The number one risk is a shortage of talent, time or money.  You should never let those problems stop a production, and we will not let that happen.  This project shoots in late September through October 2016.  I promise that this pilot will be legally protected, completed and shown publicly.  I will see to it that it goes to competitions, conventions and gets in front of funding sources so that the series may continue.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Let's say you can't contribute.  That doesn't mean you can't help:</p>

Saeed
is a 45 year old conspiracy theorist who believes without a shadow of
a doubt that extra terrestrial life exists (He’s right, obviously).</p>

Toby

These
differences in background, age and opinion don't seem to matter, the
two are still best of friends.

<p>The friends make an extra terrestrial discovery that throws their lives into chaos and pushes their friendship to the limits. Will their relationship survive? Will they survive? Or will they be probed to within an inch of their lives? <br/></p>

</div></div>","We are sure our film ""Out Of This World"" will be an intergalactic success!! 
YOU can be part of this extra terrestrial mystery!!
We need YOUR help to make this film!!






Saeed
is a 45 year old conspiracy theorist who believes without a shadow of
a doubt that extra terrestrial life exists (He’s right, obviously).



Toby
is a 23 year old skateboarding lad and a total skeptic. 




These
differences in background, age and opinion don't seem to matter, the
two are still best of friends. 

The friends make an extra terrestrial discovery that throws their lives into chaos and pushes their friendship to the limits. Will their relationship survive? Will they survive? Or will they be probed to within an inch of their lives? 




Actors Saeed Ashiq and Ryan Gilmartin stargazing during the audition
process.

The
purpose of this interstellar project is to create an entertaining,
emotionally engaging film that will be entered into film festivals
around the world and get wide exposure for everyone involved,
including YOU.


The
film will also be a calling card to obtain funding to turn the short
into a feature film.


We
believe in giving you something before asking for something in
return, so we’ve made the above video for your
entertainment… it's a sneak peek introduction to our characters.


We're
shooting in Manchester in September 2016.
""OUT
OF THIS WORLD"" will be an unforgettable experience.










We’ve
included a small payment for each of our crew members in our budget. 



Our
bare minimum target is £3566 If we go “InDemand” and pass this amount we’ll pay our crew
more than the gesture we’ve budgeted for by dividing any extra
funding equally between us.






The
building of a flying saucer model for use in the film and also... a
top secret extra terrestrial prop. Which you will see plans for here
before the film is released.
The production standard of the props which are already in production is very exciting and we can't wait to bring them to life on screen.






Two
of our cast, Saeed Ashiq and Martin Partington have been involved
from the beginning of the project. The role of Toby will be played by extremely talented actor, Ryan Gilmartin.

 
Ryan has years of experience across theatre, radio, film and television. Here's a link to his casting call pro page: http://www.castingcallpro.com/uk/actor/profile/ryan-gilmartin

Martin Partington will play the character of... Partington (one that was written specifically for him). Martin has experience playing a range of characters in short films over the past three years, he will be stepping up to play a main role in the film.

Our talented team have worked together on many projects before.

Producer Chiara Marchino has an extra Terrestrial level intelligence. She is an excellent negotiator and has produced a wide variety short films.

Director Gareth Soens-Hughes is a Royal Television Society nominated short film director and a self proclaimed egotist.
Leading the camera department is Royal Television Society and Hollywood International Film Festival award winning Director of Photography Theo Kirkpatrick. He can light a scene with the best of them along with quick witted, slightly mental gaffer Craig Shepherd. 

Sound Designer Martyn Ellis is well known for his excellent skills in all things sound and love of his own jokes.


Key Grip Aiden Bell is known for his determined attitude and no nonsense approach. Aiden works on high end TV commercials and feature films, recently working on a feature starring Sean Bean and Ruth Wilson. He has also worked as a jib assistant on Peter Kay's Car Share.

Our talented heads of the Art Department Rhiannon Clifford and Martin Butterworth will be leading a dedicated team in creating all manner of extra terrestrial props, spaceships and goodies and also creating more mess on the set than anyone else. Rhiannon has freelanced in the art department for the last 5 years, winning best Art Design and Costume at Screen Stockport Film Festival.

Our excellent VFX designer Oliver Bates won best VFX at Utah Film awards for the short called ""Kiss the Devil in the Dark"", has done VFX for Coronation Street and the 4oClock Club (a BBC children's TV series) Oli can manipulate time and space. Enough said.

Eleri Lovegrove is our incredibly gifted Make Up Artist. She will be designing and creating some prosthetics for one of the characters. Which one is....Top Secret! 

1st Assistant Director Hannah Saul is well organised, a people person and extremely loud (which makes her ideal for her role) Hannah is also an award winning short film producer and is currently working for a production company based in Manchester.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>EN </strong>My name is Ariam Tekle, I am of Eritrean origin and I was born and raised in Milan. This documentary stems from the need to recount the experiences of a generation of immigrants’ children that so far has been ignored. I trust being part of what is known as the Second Generation immigrants has automatically made me more sensible and keen to immigration, integration, identity and similar issues. I strongly felt the need of this documentary since Second Generations are currently discussed as Italy’s new phenomenon. This has made a whole generation invisible, a generation that is instead an integral part of the Italian society, and specifically in the case of Milan.</p>

<p>In the tradition of great ensemble movies like ""The Big Chill"" and ""Breakfast Club"", we want produce this inspiring story about a group of Generation-X friends that get together to celebrate a wedding. Too focused on their personal failure and too ill-equipped to really help each other, they will face a traumatic event that will force them to rethink what really matters in their lives.</p>
<p><i>Nicole (mid 30s) is a struggling writer who misses her ex boyfriend; Chris (mid 30s) is a frustrated studio musician who misses his band; Mary (mid 30s) is a married yoga instructor who misses some excitement. They’ve been best friends since high school and they get together to celebrate the wedding of another high school BFF, Julia. </i></p>
<p><i>Nicole brings some motivational books and a notepad, Chris his guitar and a bottle of Jack, Mary brings Ted (mid 40s), her workaholic husband, and a pregnancy test. </i></p>
<p><i>It’s all fun and games until Adam (50s), Nicole’s ex, arrives with his new girlfriend, the exotic and clever Veronica (mid 20s), and Pandora’s box is opened. </i></p>
<p><i>Now Nicole wants Adam back, Chris wants to get drunk and laid, and Mary confesses she’s having an affair. While everything goes sour, their personal dramas must be put on hold when tragedy hits and the wedding is suddenly cancelled.</i></p>

<p>And now, let's start to get personal.</p>
<p>My name is Simone Bartesaghi and I’m the director and producer of ‘<strong><i>It hits you when you know it'</i></strong>.</p>

<p>I moved to Los Angeles 12 years ago with my wife. At that time, I was chasing a dream. Now I am living it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476899985/jcd3gpm3k55qaulhqy7v.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>My projects and I have won several international awards (lately 'Best Screenplay' and 'Best Director to Watch' with the feature film <i><a href=""http://www.runthemovie.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RUN</a></i>) and now I’m also a professor in filmmaking at the Santa Monica College and a published author of a book called “<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Directors-Six-Senses-Innovative-Developing/dp/1615932348/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477862158&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+director%27s+six+senses"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Director’s Six Senses</a>”. </p>
<p>Why am I bragging so much about myself? It’s not my intention to brag, just to share with you the fact that I live and breath film 24/7, because truly, I love every aspect of this art form.</p>
<p>The reason why I embarked on this project is because I love the inspiration that derives from ensemble movies like “<i>The </i><i>Breakfast Club</i>” and “<i>The Big Chill</i>”, and I don't think that there are enough out there anymore.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476899830/pvwj3zv8m3vpvuygu2pv.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p>Thanks to the great story written by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2765433/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elisa Manzini</a>, I finally have the opportunity to make a movie in that tradition and I'll do my utmost to make it happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This project has already attracted the attention of very talented and creative artists.</p>
<p>Starting with the impeccable taste for talent, the Casting Director and industry veteran, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564559/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Valerie McCaffrey</a>, (known for <i>American History X</i>, <i>Hard Candy</i>, <i>Dark City</i> and <i>Babe</i>), to the creative depth of the Cinematographer, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0679932/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jon Philion</a>, (you've seen his work in the indy movie <i>Hate Crime</i> and, of course, his camera skills in the <i>Avengers</i>, <i>Suicide Squad,</i> and <i>War of the Worlds)</i> to the rich and vibrant Set Designer and industry veteran <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0242986/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Barbara Dunphy</a>, (<i>The Men Without a Face</i>, <i>Reindeer Games </i>and <i>Monk</i>).</p>

<p>Thanks to the contribution and support of the Los Angeles Film School, we already have a place to shoot (in the legendary Main Stage) and have a portion of the equipment. </p>
<p>But it’s not enough.</p>
<p>First of all, we need, of course, actors. Oh yes. Convincing, talented, passionate actors that will breath true life into the characters.</p>
<p>But we also need a crew to shoot, more props and decorations, a few more tools to make the movie look professional and… of course, we need to feed everybody!</p>
<p>And this is where you come in. We need your support and your donations to reach the budget for our project and to start principle photography on December 16th.</p>
<p>Here is how we are going to use your funds - based on the budget and the independent nature of our project, the money will be invested according to the following guidelines:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478312170/wfi9despckqxlwjkq1dy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The reason why we decided to do a flexible crowdfunding campaign is based on two facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>We know our budget: we know what the least amount of money we need is and what the most amount of money we need is. Both budgets will allow us to create a great story but, as you can imagine, one allow us to access different talents and more 'technical toys' then the other. The story won't change, but the opportunities accepted by the market will change drastically. After all, this is still an industry, right?</li>
<li>Investors are welcome: we are reaching out to different kinds of sources, and for the one of you that might be interested in investing in a movie, we are right here, ready to share all the details of our business plan with you. Contact us at sibamedia@gmail.com.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478041085/g5s5b6erfjnpl9j9nd68.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Why should you do it?</p>
<p>Well, if the story pitch is not enough and my italian charm didn’t cast a spell on you, well, we still have many perks for you, whatever the level of contribution you can and want to give. Depending on your contribution, you can enjoy the following; a signed copy of the script, a visit on the set, a special one-on-one encounter with the Director (myself), the title and credit of Executive Producer, and all the way up to the professional coverage and commentary of your own script. I'm sure you'll find further motivation in our perks list.</p>
<p>But to me, the thing that is most important is what I call the <strong><i>Intangible</i> <i>ROI</i></strong>, or, 'return of investment'. The <strong><i>Intangible ROI</i></strong> is a special kind of return that only movies can provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, a movie doesn’t have a due date. There is no expiration. When a movie <i>is</i> done, it’s forever.</li>
<li>Second, it does have a life of its own. A movie can provide financial and emotional rewards for a life time, an eternity.</li>
<li>Third, a movie can contribute to the enrichment of society and the enrichment of each other, and this art form is something we call ‘cinema'.</li>
</ol>
<p>And of course, we are perfectly aware of the fact that not everyone can support us with money. But you can still help us!</p>
<p>Here is how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please spread the word about our campaign, and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us!</li>
<li>If you have the capability to help us through 'in kind' services or products, contact us ASAP.</li>
<li>Share our campaign with your social network pals and through the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you do it for us, for the special perks, or for your Intangible ROI, whatever your motivation is, please help us contribute to society with our little cautionary tale.</p>

<p>The list of perks that we have created tries to offer a variety of goods and services that will make you proud for supporting us. Take advantage of the professional experts involved in the project, and access a true production experience!</p>
<p>Considering that the characters of our movie all belong to Generation-X, and that their teenage years were between the mid 80s and 90s, we thought that it would be appropriate to pay homage to those years' best movies and legendary quotes. Are you ready?</p>

<p>Let's start with ""<i>I was born ready</i>"" (Big Trouble in Little China)...it is our <i>Thank You</i>!</p>
<p>We'll give you a big THANK YOU that grants you access to all our updates, along with a classic souvenir from the movie (the signed script) and the FULL SET EXPERIENCE where you can see what's happening on the set every day via streaming.</p>
<p>And, one of my favorites, the song game ('I feel the need, the need for speed'). This is a game that the characters play in the movie, and we are going to play it with you. Play the game with us and get the song from iTunes.</p>
<p>You can also take advantage and get connected with the Director and book author, again, myself, Simone Bartesaghi. I have won international festivals both as Director and as Writer, am the author of the book ""The Director's Six Senses"", and a directing and screenwriting teacher at the Santa Monica College. If you want to know more about the movie and how I prepared for it (Director's Vision), you can contribute, and we can have a one on one interview about how to become a director and you'll receive a copy of my book (Director's Six Senses). If you have one, I can even read your script and write out a special coverage and give constructive commentary on it (Directing Consulting).</p>
<p>The last group of perks are the biggest and best payback for your help. </p>
<p>Everything gets real with the last group of perks: with Associate Producer, Executive Producer and Special Executive Guest, you'll get real movie credits, real contact with the crew, and even a trip to the set.</p>

<p>As with every film production, we are going to face many challenges and risks. The way we are mitigating these risks is through assembling a team of highly skilled and experienced professionals that have been in the trenches for a while and can navigate the treacherous waters of production. We're also taking advantage of the logistical and organizational opportunities that the crew members can access thanks to their wide and unique networks.</p>
<p>Thanks to these elements, and all our hard work, we believe and know we will succeed.</p>
<p>If, at any time during this adventure, it will become apparent that the movie cannot be produced and therefore the perks cannot be delivered, we decided that all the funds will be returned to the donors.</p>
<p>We truly think that, when you see this movie on the big screen, you'll be proud to be enlisted as one of the early supporters that believed in this great story.</p>

In the tradition of great ensemble movies like ""The Big Chill"" and ""Breakfast Club"", we want produce this inspiring story about a group of Generation-X friends that get together to celebrate a wedding. Too focused on their personal failure and too ill-equipped to really help each other, they will face a traumatic event that will force them to rethink what really matters in their lives.
Nicole (mid 30s) is a struggling writer who misses her ex boyfriend; Chris (mid 30s) is a frustrated studio musician who misses his band; Mary (mid 30s) is a married yoga instructor who misses some excitement. They’ve been best friends since high school and they get together to celebrate the wedding of another high school BFF, Julia. 
Nicole brings some motivational books and a notepad, Chris his guitar and a bottle of Jack, Mary brings Ted (mid 40s), her workaholic husband, and a pregnancy test. 
It’s all fun and games until Adam (50s), Nicole’s ex, arrives with his new girlfriend, the exotic and clever Veronica (mid 20s), and Pandora’s box is opened. 
Now Nicole wants Adam back, Chris wants to get drunk and laid, and Mary confesses she’s having an affair. While everything goes sour, their personal dramas must be put on hold when tragedy hits and the wedding is suddenly cancelled.
 

And now, let's start to get personal.
My name is Simone Bartesaghi and I’m the director and producer of ‘It hits you when you know it'.
As you can see from my profile, I’m Italian, and yes, in case you were wondering, I know how to make a great pizza.
I moved to Los Angeles 12 years ago with my wife. At that time, I was chasing a dream. Now I am living it.
My projects and I have won several international awards (lately 'Best Screenplay' and 'Best Director to Watch' with the feature film RUN) and now I’m also a professor in filmmaking at the Santa Monica College and a published author of a book called “The Director’s Six Senses”. 
Why am I bragging so much about myself? It’s not my intention to brag, just to share with you the fact that I live and breath film 24/7, because truly, I love every aspect of this art form.
The reason why I embarked on this project is because I love the inspiration that derives from ensemble movies like “The Breakfast Club” and “The Big Chill”, and I don't think that there are enough out there anymore.

Thanks to the great story written by Elisa Manzini, I finally have the opportunity to make a movie in that tradition and I'll do my utmost to make it happen.
 
This project has already attracted the attention of very talented and creative artists.
Starting with the impeccable taste for talent, the Casting Director and industry veteran, Valerie McCaffrey, (known for American History X, Hard Candy, Dark City and Babe), to the creative depth of the Cinematographer, Jon Philion, (you've seen his work in the indy movie Hate Crime and, of course, his camera skills in the Avengers, Suicide Squad, and War of the Worlds) to the rich and vibrant Set Designer and industry veteran Barbara Dunphy, (The Men Without a Face, Reindeer Games and Monk).
 

To tell this great story, we need resources.
Thanks to the contribution and support of the Los Angeles Film School, we already have a place to shoot (in the legendary Main Stage) and have a portion of the equipment. 
But it’s not enough.
First of all, we need, of course, actors. Oh yes. Convincing, talented, passionate actors that will breath true life into the characters.
But we also need a crew to shoot, more props and decorations, a few more tools to make the movie look professional and… of course, we need to feed everybody!
And this is where you come in. We need your support and your donations to reach the budget for our project and to start principle photography on December 16th.
Here is how we are going to use your funds - based on the budget and the independent nature of our project, the money will be invested according to the following guidelines:

The reason why we decided to do a flexible crowdfunding campaign is based on two facts:

We know our budget: we know what the least amount of money we need is and what the most amount of money we need is. Both budgets will allow us to create a great story but, as you can imagine, one allow us to access different talents and more 'technical toys' then the other. The story won't change, but the opportunities accepted by the market will change drastically. After all, this is still an industry, right?
Investors are welcome: we are reaching out to different kinds of sources, and for the one of you that might be interested in investing in a movie, we are right here, ready to share all the details of our business plan with you. Contact us at sibamedia@gmail.com.

 

Why should you do it?
Well, if the story pitch is not enough and my italian charm didn’t cast a spell on you, well, we still have many perks for you, whatever the level of contribution you can and want to give. Depending on your contribution, you can enjoy the following; a signed copy of the script, a visit on the set, a special one-on-one encounter with the Director (myself), the title and credit of Executive Producer, and all the way up to the professional coverage and commentary of your own script. I'm sure you'll find further motivation in our perks list.
But to me, the thing that is most important is what I call the Intangible ROI, or, 'return of investment'. The Intangible ROI is a special kind of return that only movies can provide.

First, a movie doesn’t have a due date. There is no expiration. When a movie is done, it’s forever.
Second, it does have a life of its own. A movie can provide financial and emotional rewards for a life time, an eternity.
Third, a movie can contribute to the enrichment of society and the enrichment of each other, and this art form is something we call ‘cinema'.

And of course, we are perfectly aware of the fact that not everyone can support us with money. But you can still help us!
Here is how:

Please spread the word about our campaign, and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us!
If you have the capability to help us through 'in kind' services or products, contact us ASAP.
Share our campaign with your social network pals and through the Indiegogo share tools!

Whether you do it for us, for the special perks, or for your Intangible ROI, whatever your motivation is, please help us contribute to society with our little cautionary tale.
 



The list of perks that we have created tries to offer a variety of goods and services that will make you proud for supporting us. Take advantage of the professional experts involved in the project, and access a true production experience!
Considering that the characters of our movie all belong to Generation-X, and that their teenage years were between the mid 80s and 90s, we thought that it would be appropriate to pay homage to those years' best movies and legendary quotes. Are you ready?










Let's start with ""I was born ready"" (Big Trouble in Little China)...it is our Thank You!
We'll give you a big THANK YOU that grants you access to all our updates, along with a classic souvenir from the movie (the signed script) and the FULL SET EXPERIENCE where you can see what's happening on the set every day via streaming.
And, one of my favorites, the song game ('I feel the need, the need for speed'). This is a game that the characters play in the movie, and we are going to play it with you. Play the game with us and get the song from iTunes.
You can also take advantage and get connected with the Director and book author, again, myself, Simone Bartesaghi. I have won international festivals both as Director and as Writer, am the author of the book ""The Director's Six Senses"", and a directing and screenwriting teacher at the Santa Monica College. If you want to know more about the movie and how I prepared for it (Director's Vision), you can contribute, and we can have a one on one interview about how to become a director and you'll receive a copy of my book (Director's Six Senses). If you have one, I can even read your script and write out a special coverage and give constructive commentary on it (Directing Consulting).
The last group of perks are the biggest and best payback for your help. 
Everything gets real with the last group of perks: with Associate Producer, Executive Producer and Special Executive Guest, you'll get real movie credits, real contact with the crew, and even a trip to the set.
 


 

As with every film production, we are going to face many challenges and risks. The way we are mitigating these risks is through assembling a team of highly skilled and experienced professionals that have been in the trenches for a while and can navigate the treacherous waters of production. We're also taking advantage of the logistical and organizational opportunities that the crew members can access thanks to their wide and unique networks.
Thanks to these elements, and all our hard work, we believe and know we will succeed.
If, at any time during this adventure, it will become apparent that the movie cannot be produced and therefore the perks cannot be delivered, we decided that all the funds will be returned to the donors.
We truly think that, when you see this movie on the big screen, you'll be proud to be enlisted as one of the early supporters that believed in this great story.
 
Thank you everybody,We wish you all the best,Simone Bartesaghi and The Production TeamAvreste mai immaginato di poter partecipare ad un'impresa come questa? Stiamo facendo qualcosa di veramente straordinario e con il vostro supporto ci riusciremo. Cominciamo dall'inizio.LA STORIANella tradizione di “Il grande freddo”, “Breakfast Club” e ""Compagni di Scuola"" vogliamo raccontare una storia su un gruppo di amici della Generazione X che si ritrovano per celebrare un matrimonio. Troppo focalizzati sui loro fallimenti personali e con un bagaglio emotivo troppo pesante per aiutarsi a vicenda, i sei amici dovranno affrontare un evento traumatico che li costringerà a ripensare cosa è che conta veramente nella vita.  Nicole è una squattrinata scrittrice a cui manca il suo ex, Adam; Chris è un musicista frustrato a cui manca la sua band; Mary è un’istruttrice di yoga sposata con Ted e le manca una vita eccitante; sono migliori amici fin dalla scuola superiore e si ritrovano per celebrare il matrimonio di Julia e Jimmy.Nicole si porta dei libri e gli appunti per l'eternamente rinviato nuovo libro, Chris la chitarra e una bottiglia di whiskey per trovare l'ispirazione giusta, e Mary porta il marito, un avvocato arrivista e, di nascosto, un test di gravidanza.L’atmosfera sembra allegra e giocosa finché arriva Adam che si presenta con Veronica, la sua nuova fidanzata, giovane, esotica, intraprendente. Ed il classico vaso di Pandora viene aperto rivelando sogni, drammi, segreti e fantasie.Ora Nicole vuole riconquistare Adam, Chris vuole ubriacarsi e Mary confessa di tradire Ted.Mentre tutto va a rotoli, i loro drammi personali vengono improvvisamente eclissati quando una tragedia mette in pericolo il matrimonio. E ora, veniamo a noi!Mi chiamo Simone Bartesaghi e sono il regista e produttore di “It hits you when you know it”. Sono italiano e da quando sono arrivato con mia moglie in America 12 anni fa mi sono rimboccato le maniche per avverare il mio sogno e per imparare a fare la pizza, perche' da queste parti non se ne trova.Oggi sono un regista e sceneggiatore con diversi film alle spalle (Run, Downstream) e premi internazionali. Sono anche professore di regia e sceneggiatura al Santa Monica College e autore di un libro, che uscira' presto anche in Italia, che si intitola ""The Director's Six Senses"" (I sei sensi del regista).Direi che il sogno lo sto proprio vivendo. E la pizza? Ebbene sì, anche gli Italiani che ci vengono a trovare me lo dicono, faccio una pizza da leccarsi i baffi!Non vi dico tutte queste cose per vantarmi, ma solo per condividere con voi l’amore che ho per il cinema in tutti i suoi aspetti.Il motivo per cui mi sono appassionato a questo progetto è perché amo i film d’insieme come “Il grande freddo”, “Breakfast Club” ed anche il nostrano ""Compagni di Scuola"" e non penso ce ne siano abbastanza oggigiorno. Sembra che manchi l'ispirazione giusta per raccontare questo tipo di storie.Grazie alla bellissima storia scritta da Elisa Manzini ho finalmente l’opportunità di fare un film di quel genere.Il progetto ha già attratto l’attenzione di molti artisti di talento, a partire dalla direttrice del casting Valerie McCaffrey (conosciuta per American History X, Hard Candy, Dark City e Babe), sino al direttore della fotografia Jon Philion (Avengers, Suicide Squad e La Guerra dei Mondi) passando per la scenografa e veterana dell’industria del cinema Barbara Dunphy (L’Uomo senza faccia, Monk e Reindeer Games). ECCO COSA VI OFFRIAMOGrazie alla passione di molti colleghi che hanno riconosciuto il valore del nostro progetto, siamo riusciti a mettere insieme un team assolutamente vincente e ad accedere a opportunita' uniche.Siamo in contatto con grandi attori interessati alle parti (aggiornamenti sull'argomento in pochi giorni), inoltre avremo accesso al teatro di posa della Los Angeles Film School e all'utilizzo di equipaggiamento e attrezzature come telecamere, luci e carrelli.Ma i tempi sono ristretti, dobbiamo girare entro la fine dell'anno o tutte queste opportunita' svaniranno.Ed è qui che entrate in gioco voi. Ci servono il vostro aiuto e le vostre donazioni per raggiungere il nostro budget e iniziare a girare il 16 dicembre.Essendo questo un film indipendente, ecco come useremo i fondi:Se la passione per il cinema non e' abbastanza, se la storia che vogliamo raccontare non e' abbastanza, se la voglia di creare qualcosa di unico e speciale non e' abbastanza, allora abbiamo creato anche dei benefici tangibili (in Inglese li chiamano PERKS).Li trovate nella colonna qui a destra. Hanno nomi 'eccentrici', sono infatti tutte citazionida film degli anni 80. Ogni ""Perk"", contiene una serie di 'benefici', dal copione firmato dalla sceneggiatrice e dal regista, ad una visita sul set, da un incontro col regista per avere dei consigli professionali a un credito come Produttore Esecutivo e tanto altro. Potrete trovare sicuramente qualcosa che vi interessa.Per gli appassionati, vediamo se riconoscete i film dalle citazioni...""I was born ready (Io sono nato pronto)"" - donazione di $ 10 - In cambio ricevete gli aggiornamenti sul progetto e un ringraziamento nei titoli di coda.""Yippie Ki-Yay motherfuckers (Yippie Ki-Yay, figli di puttana!)"" - donazione di $ 20 - In cambio ricevete gli aggiornamenti sul progetto, un ringraziamento nei titoli di coda e una copia digitale del copione firmata.""Roads?

<h3><strong>We’ve built the Queen’s Castle – now we have to fill it up!</strong></h3>
<p>Hey, remember back on the 22<sup>nd</sup> March, when <a href=""https://rafikimwema.com/constance-media-articles/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Queen Constance Hall shared a link</a> to <a href=""http://www.rafikimwema.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rafikimwema.com</a> with an impassioned plea to help raise funds to build a second safe house at our farm in Nakuru, Kenya, for sexually abused little girls? Of course you do, because what happened in the hours and day following her post were a demonstration of the very best of humankind and community.</p>
<p>Constance set forth a trickle of empathy, and what returned was a tidal wave of love, kindness and hope. By 10am the following morning our campaign to build a ‘Queen’s Castle’ had raised $150,000 – DOUBLE the original target of $75,000. And thanks to kindness and generosity of people just like you, $200,000 was raised in less than one month. <i>Rafiki Mwema</i> was able to build the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/277005382452854/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=652983958188326"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">‘<i>Queen’s Castle’</i> </a>and so much more.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476689565/clwhutma9igtjqko1bqu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>The ‘Queen’s Castle’ now stands tall – ready to provide refuge and a future to 19 very vulnerable young girls, however we need so much more than walls and a roof. The time has come to call on you for a little more help, because we need to furnish the ‘Queen’s Castle’ before the girls can move in.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476689671/sy9bdh17fl6o9pmerifo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We’ve crunched the numbers, and what we need is $35,000 so that we can provide items like beds, bedding, mosquito nets, a fridge, cutlery, plates, towels and so much more so that these young Queens may be afforded the dignity that simple creature comforts like these provide. By taking care of these needs for them – the needs that most of us don’t even have to think twice about in our own lives - we can allow them to focus on themselves, and begin healing from the unimaginable trauma that has been burdened upon them.</p>
<h3><strong>Need further motivation?</strong></h3>
<p>We are eternally grateful for the awareness that you bring to our cause with every share, every click, and every cent you are kind enough to bid for us.</p>
<p>So we don’t want to ask you to donate for nothing. We know the feeling of helping these kids is immeasurable in dollars, we really do, but we’d love to give something back too.</p>

</div></div>","We’ve built the Queen’s Castle – now we have to fill it up!
Hey, remember back on the 22nd March, when Queen Constance Hall shared a link to rafikimwema.com with an impassioned plea to help raise funds to build a second safe house at our farm in Nakuru, Kenya, for sexually abused little girls? Of course you do, because what happened in the hours and day following her post were a demonstration of the very best of humankind and community.
Constance set forth a trickle of empathy, and what returned was a tidal wave of love, kindness and hope. By 10am the following morning our campaign to build a ‘Queen’s Castle’ had raised $150,000 – DOUBLE the original target of $75,000. And thanks to kindness and generosity of people just like you, $200,000 was raised in less than one month. Rafiki Mwema was able to build the ‘Queen’s Castle’ and so much more.
The ‘Queen’s Castle’ now stands tall – ready to provide refuge and a future to 19 very vulnerable young girls, however we need so much more than walls and a roof. The time has come to call on you for a little more help, because we need to furnish the ‘Queen’s Castle’ before the girls can move in.

We’ve crunched the numbers, and what we need is $35,000 so that we can provide items like beds, bedding, mosquito nets, a fridge, cutlery, plates, towels and so much more so that these young Queens may be afforded the dignity that simple creature comforts like these provide. By taking care of these needs for them – the needs that most of us don’t even have to think twice about in our own lives - we can allow them to focus on themselves, and begin healing from the unimaginable trauma that has been burdened upon them.
Need further motivation?
We are eternally grateful for the awareness that you bring to our cause with every share, every click, and every cent you are kind enough to bid for us.
So we don’t want to ask you to donate for nothing. We know the feeling of helping these kids is immeasurable in dollars, we really do, but we’d love to give something back too.
This gorgeous painting created by artist Cat Lee was originally created for our recent Event in Byron. It was auctioned off to a lucky winner who purchased it as a surprise for his wife ... who happens to be Constance Hall! #onyabill

We have permission from both artist Cat Lee and lucky winner Constance to reproduce this print named ‘Malkia Mtoto’ (small queen) to raise funds for our home.
So, here’s what we’re thinking, you can donate towards furnishing the ‘Queen’s Castle’ and receive this print in return!Donate $25 – you’ll get an A5 sized print of ‘Malkia Mtoto’Donate $50 – you’ll get an A4 sized print of ‘Malkia Mtoto’Donate $100 – you’ll get an A3 sized print of ‘Malkia Mtoto’
Example of Print below.  Frame not included. 

We will also send you this card to explain where the money has gone in case you are gifting this to someone!

But, as always we want you to help however you can. You don't HAVE to purchase a print. If you would just like to make a donation no matter how big or small we appreciate anything you can do from as little as $1.. as we have seen with the success of the Queens Castle, every single dollar helps. 
You can help in many more ways
We know that money can be difficult to come by, and we truly do appreciate every single cent that you entrust to us for the care of these children.
If you can’t spare a cent today, we understand, and we want you to know that awareness, for us, is just as valuable.

<p>Hey, my name is Glacier Rohrer. Since I was young, Star Wars has been a large part of my life. You couldn’t walk through my room without stepping on Yoda’s ears or someone’s lightsaber. I cried when Episode 3 came out but I couldn’t see it until the following week in theaters. I was obsessed with anything Star Wars I could get my hands on, including books and comics. I also bought a video camera at a very early age and started making short films, I loved writing scripts and bringing my ideas to a screen.</p>
<p> A few years after Revenge of the Sith came out, my love started to fade. I got older and life became what is to be expected out of adulthood; hectic and stressful. Then, amazing news came: Disney unveiled they would be continuing the Star Wars Franchise in the form of 3 more movies, and on top of that, Star Wars story movies on the side. I was so ecstatic, after 2 years at college, I dropped out and got two full time jobs, saving money and putting everything I had into this project: Chaos Evolved. I was inspired again, the kid in me had emerged once more.</p>
<p> A friend of mine, Matt Seames, sat down with me and in one night and day we wrote a script that was a work of art. I’m serious, this story will blow your mind, and I pray every day I can share it with all of my fellow fans. This campaign is so important to me, because of all the sacrifices I have made for it. I have spent over $20,000 just from personal expenses to make this film happen, because of my love for Star Wars and for film. This will be an achievement of a lifetime, and I want the contributors to know every donation matters. You have the chance to help fund quite possibly the greatest Star Wars feature length fan film to date, and win an opportunity to be on set with us for the whole ride! We hope you can be a part of what we are trying to accomplish, and take part in something in a galaxy far far away!</p>

</div></div>","For more than three years we have followed Rhodessa Jones and the Medea Project: Theater for Incarcerated Women/HIV Circle.  This remarkable, diverse ensemble of women worked together across colors, ages and backgrounds in their creation and performance of “Birthright?” - powerful stories of surviving rape, asserting their reproductive rights and living with HIV.
The women’s personal truths, their creative process and their performances are framed by the current political storm over choice - the fight to protect women’s reproductive rights and full access to quality health care. The “Birthright?” documentary project brings the Medea Project story to the screen, giving life and reach to their work beyond the Bay Area performances. Our goal is to reach a national audience with the work of Rhodessa and The Medea Project, and to provide advocates for women’s rights and health with compelling stories.  The project includes a full length documentary about the Medea project and their creation of ""Birthright?,""  a video version of the complete performance at Brava Theater in SF,  short web-friendly stories excerpted from the film that focus on critical issues - choice, living with HIV and surviving rape - and an engagement guide tailored to diverse audiences. Advocacy groups will be provided with materials free of charge. We need your help to get this finished and available to communities across the country. 
TRAILER:“Birthright?” is not content to simply shed light on the pervasive oppression of women and minorities; rather, it's intent on crushing it, and its method is through the rawness of their stories… aggressive, unapologetic, self-assured femininity.” San Francisco ChronicleThe Medea Project, founded and led by Cultural Odyssey’s Rhodessa Jones, is among the most provocative of contemporary theater workshops. The original idea for ""Birthright?"" grew out of conversations between the Medea Project and Planned Parenthood in the greater Bay Area. 
Rhodessa Jones: “We’ve learned that Planned Parenthood plays into the lives of many of the broken and wounded people. Our company is creating a tapestry, a patchwork quilt…sharing women's stories of survival.”
Many of the Medea project women - against all odds - have emerged from the shadows of addiction, violent abuse, jail and hopelessness to the sisterhood of Medea and the spotlight of the stage to tell their stories. The artistic vision documented is itself path-breaking - bringing together women of diverse experiences to find their voices and create professionally produced theater directly from their own lives. The women of the Medea Project are an inspiration.  Please join us in any way you can. If you cannot give, help spread the word. Use the share tools.  Share our campaign video and the ""Birthright?"" documentary preview. Email friends and family.



“In over thirty years of working professionally in media production and distribution, the Medea women bring the most compelling and unique story with which I’ve had the privilege to become involved.”   Bruce Schmiechen, Producer
The immediate funding goal of $24,500 will bring the documentary through story editing to final post-production. Donors of $20 or more will each get preview videos of excerpts from the “Birthright?”  theatrical performance. (If we reach beyond the editing stage goal via this campaign, all additional funds will go to completion and distribution. Contributions are through the 501c3 fiscal sponsor, Cultural Odyssey.)

<h3>How it started…</h3>
<p>My name is Arkadius. I'm a 3D designer and a barista. I've spent few years of my life making coffee as a barista, coffee event manager, and coffee shop manager. One of the things I have learned is the importance of <strong>efficiency</strong>. After seeing <strong>advancements</strong> made with the espresso machines, more barista tools designed to help <strong>protect barista's wrists</strong>, I decided to challenge the way we ""coffee makers"" clean the portafilter after each espresso. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627225851/iwk84cweugcadrixdjvx.png"" src=""""/> </p>
<h2>. . . </h2>
<p>After almost 2 years of prototyping and 7 iterations of QuinSpin here we are :)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/GJJMQtJG06hplLpOku/giphy.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<h2>. . .</h2>
<p>QuinSpin - actually does the job it's designed to do! :) It’s a <strong>fast, silent, clean, and healthy</strong> way to clean your coffee basket! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/Tv3An3XmlnM2kOC7Oq/giphy.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<h2>. . .</h2>
<p>Together with my small team of hardworking people, we are running <strong>pre-production</strong> with help of different suppliers. We're using HP MJF technology at the moment which is a high-quality type of 3D additive manufacturing</p>
<p>.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/La7JKeAIjFdlP4KC9t/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<div>
<h2>.   .   .</h2>
<p>Let me clear that we have <strong>UK and PCT patents pending</strong> for specific features of QuinSpin, so we will be using HP MJF Technology anyway for our drills and brushes. We want to make sure you get the <strong>right fit</strong> for your coffee basket!</p>
<h2>.   .   .</h2>
<h3>QuinSpin's features: </h3>

<p><strong>Correct technique of use:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.Drill head -&gt;<br/>2. Tiny pause when lifting allows the motor to slow down a bit. -&gt;<br/>3. Proceed to brush</strong></p>

<h2>.   .   .</h2>
<p>Our patent-pending <strong>brushes can be refurbished to help reduce plastic waste.</strong><br/>The brush should last min <strong>10 000 cycles or longer</strong>. <br/><strong>TIP</strong>: If it's spinning - don't press it harder. Using force not gonna help with better results. You can only slow down the motor and deform the brush faster!</p>
<p><strong>Be gentle</strong> :) It's about the technique, not force! </p>

<h2>What we'd love…</h2>
<p>We would <strong>LOVE</strong> for you <strong>to see the benefit of QuinSpin</strong>! <br/>After getting quotes from multiple companies that can help us grow we need to raise around 60 000 GBP. It's around 300 crowdfunded QuinSpins. </p>
<p><strong>The money would go for:</strong></p>
<p>2 <strong>mold injection forms</strong> ( 1 for the QuinSpin main unit and the 2nd one for a ""family"" mold for the smaller components) (This is the longest process that can last up to 10 weeks)</p>
<p>Designing <strong>custom packaging</strong> for QuinSpin ( Min order quantity 1500 pieces. Lead time around 3-4 weeks)</p>
<p>Setting up the <strong>assembly line, warehouse</strong> and <strong>employing</strong> more people to our team</p>
<p>We are also considering <strong>our own MJF production.</strong> HP in the UK is ready to help us out, but it all depends on how well our campaign will do! We will keep you posted!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What's in it FOR YOU...</h3>
<p>First you can be <strong>proud</strong> you're helping to <strong>bring QuinSpin</strong> - the missing piece to efficiency - <strong>to LIFE</strong>!</p>
<p>and of course some <strong>PERKS</strong> :)</p>
<p>QuinSpin - portafilter cleaner, so you can finally stop exploiting your wrists, get rid of the dirty clothes, and stop making your hands look like you're a car mechanic! :)</p>

<h3>One final push…</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We have waited long with the launch of the crowdfunding campaign. We wanted to test QuinSpin in real-life conditions and be sure it does the job it’s designed to do. For the last 2.5 years, we were making mistakes so once our campaign is launched, there would be no surprises.  We have found suppliers and manufacturers, who provided us with quotes and lead times.  All we need now is for a few hundred people to see the benefits of QuinSpin!<br/><strong>Can you see it?</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/IZENPC6Xst3tZt45cS/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></strong></p>

<div>
<p><strong><strong>If you aren’t able to contribute to our campaign, please spread the word. Maybe you know some baristas or your friend or family owns a coffee shop? We’d appreciate all the effort :)</strong></strong></p>

I've spent few years of my life making coffee as a barista, coffee event manager, and coffee shop manager. One of the things I have learned is the importance of efficiency. After seeing advancements made with the espresso machines, more barista tools designed to help protect barista's wrists, I decided to challenge the way we ""coffee makers"" clean the portafilter after each espresso. 
 
. . . 
After almost 2 years of prototyping and 7 iterations of QuinSpin here we are :)
 
. . .
QuinSpin - actually does the job it's designed to do! :) It’s a fast, silent, clean, and healthy way to clean your coffee basket! 
 
. . .
Together with my small team of hardworking people, we are running pre-production with help of different suppliers. We're using HP MJF technology at the moment which is a high-quality type of 3D additive manufacturing
.

.   .   .
Let me clear that we have UK and PCT patents pending for specific features of QuinSpin, so we will be using HP MJF Technology anyway for our drills and brushes. We want to make sure you get the right fit for your coffee basket!
.   .   .
QuinSpin's features: 
Drill designed according to the geometry of your coffee basket 
 
Brush head trimmed to fit your coffee basket
 
Interchangeable heads

.   .   .
Correct technique of use:
1.Drill head ->2. Tiny pause when lifting allows the motor to slow down a bit. ->3. Proceed to brush

.   .   .
Our patent-pending brushes can be refurbished to help reduce plastic waste.The brush should last min 10 000 cycles or longer. TIP: If it's spinning - don't press it harder. Using force not gonna help with better results. You can only slow down the motor and deform the brush faster!
Be gentle :) It's about the technique, not force! 
 
We will be providing bristles replacement as an Add On.
Smile :)
 
 
What we'd love…
We would LOVE for you to see the benefit of QuinSpin! After getting quotes from multiple companies that can help us grow we need to raise around 60 000 GBP. It's around 300 crowdfunded QuinSpins. 
The money would go for:
2 mold injection forms ( 1 for the QuinSpin main unit and the 2nd one for a ""family"" mold for the smaller components) (This is the longest process that can last up to 10 weeks)
Designing custom packaging for QuinSpin ( Min order quantity 1500 pieces. Lead time around 3-4 weeks)
Setting up the assembly line, warehouse and employing more people to our team
We are also considering our own MJF production. HP in the UK is ready to help us out, but it all depends on how well our campaign will do! We will keep you posted!
 
What's in it FOR YOU...
First you can be proud you're helping to bring QuinSpin - the missing piece to efficiency - to LIFE!
and of course some PERKS :)
QuinSpin - portafilter cleaner, so you can finally stop exploiting your wrists, get rid of the dirty clothes, and stop making your hands look like you're a car mechanic! :)

Feedback…


Your support is precious to us! We know QuinSpin will benefit the coffee community worldwide! Not only speeding up the process of cleaning coffee baskets, but also eliminating the sudden noise of banging and protecting your wrists! 
We have over 100 pre-production QuinSpins already roaming in the world and constantly providing feedback.

One final push…


We have waited long with the launch of the crowdfunding campaign. We wanted to test QuinSpin in real-life conditions and be sure it does the job it’s designed to do. For the last 2.5 years, we were making mistakes so once our campaign is launched, there would be no surprises.  We have found suppliers and manufacturers, who provided us with quotes and lead times.  All we need now is for a few hundred people to see the benefits of QuinSpin!Can you see it?



If you aren’t able to contribute to our campaign, please spread the word. Maybe you know some baristas or your friend or family owns a coffee shop? We’d appreciate all the effort :)
Thank you!",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>When titanium is exposed in air, a very thin layer of titanium atoms interact with the oxygen to create a nano-coating of titanium dioxide (Titania).

<h2>Due to Popular Demand</h2>
<p>Last year we introduced BARE Knives. High-quality, affordable, and sustainable cookware.  We were blown away to reach our funding goal within 24 hours. Since then we've been getting emails asking when we would produce more knife types.  So, not wanting to disappoint, we're back. And we have all the knives you'll ever need!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://barecookware.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Intro-gif.gif"" src=""""/>  </p>
<p>We've spent the last year testing, redesigning, and retesting. We're ready to introduce BARE Knives 2.0. The be-all and end-all of knife sets. Our knives are razor-sharp, carbon-negative, and come with a lifetime warranty. The mountain pattern on each knife stops most foods from sticking. And honestly, it just looks gorgeous. </p>
<p>You'll buy directly from us. With no middlemen and a crowdfunding volume discount, you get an incredible one-time-only price.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What Our Backers Say</strong></h3>
<p>We are very proud of a 4.7 / 5.0 average rating from our backers. Our previous campaign was a success thanks to our amazing backers. We have used all their feedback in designing our knife set and improving our products.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623181138/y6o4rveznvud7hb7bm61.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3><strong>But My Butter Knife Also Works?</strong></h3>
<p>Sure, you can cut a sirloin steak with a cheap plastic paring knife and some elbow grease. You might even enjoy the steak. But what if we could make slicing that steak enjoyable too!? And that's just it, you're supposed to enjoy cooking. </p>
<p>Before you know it, you'll even want to slice some vegetables! We all know: homemade food is healthier food. We want you to enjoy cooking. And with the right tools, it's even faster than ordering in.</p>

<h3><strong>The Right Knife For The Job</strong></h3>
<p>A good set of kitchen knives will last you a lifetime. To ensure every kitchen task is covered we designed a 5-piece knife set. Check out the sharp details that make each knife unique!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623181213/dvgz1msvwxvdjqymmoli.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>These five knives combined, cover the complete spectrum of kitchen tasks.  There are, however, two additional knives we absolutely love. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623181236/yzn9rpecbvxmlf6ismfl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Nakiri is perfect for cutting straight slices or julienne. It's the perfect vegetable knife. The Kiritsuke on the other hand excels at meat and fish. Cutting sashimi or a large piece of meat, this 10-inch sword makes easy work of it.</p>
<p>We are aware you might have never heard of these knives, and probably have never seen the need for them. But we know how amazing and unique these knives are and we want you to have them. Because we reached our stretch goals, everyone who pledged for a 5 piece set will receive these knives for free.  These knives make cooking so much more fun. We would feel bad not getting them to you.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>How We Maintain An Honest Price</strong></h3>
<p>Traditionally retailers mark up the products they sell between 50 and 100%. This means you could be paying double for the same goods. This doesn't sit right with us.</p>
<p>Separately these 5 knives will cost more than €300,-.  If we reach our stretch goals the 7 knives you'll receive have a combined MSRP of €483! We're offering our complete set to you for only €149,-. We can offer you this price because we ship directly to you, unlike traditional retailers. No middlemen or retailer markup means more knives for your money. </p>
<p>With your pledges, we are able to manufacture a large batch of knives. Because of the large batch size, we are able to reduce production costs. This means even more discount.</p>

<h3><strong>What Makes Our Knives Great</strong></h3>
<p>We have designed our knives for a lifetime of use. Below you can find all the nitty-gritty design details. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623396408/r2r22mgrbpq8epgtmarr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our Manufacturing Process</strong></h3>
<p>Under tremendous pressure and heat, a steel blank is imprinted with our unique mountain pattern. This does three things. Firstly, through a mechanism called 'work hardening', it hardens the surface of the knife steel. Secondly, the mountain pattern reduces surface tension during cutting, which means food does not stick as much. Lastly, the mountain pattern signifies our sustainable approach. </p>
<p>The blanks are then reheated, quenched, and tempered to 58HRC. Next, we grind the primary bevel under continuous water cooling. After fitting and finishing the hardwood handle our knives are sharpened by hand.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623181454/hyc0sltzwvlffygptdc8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Sustainable Production</strong></h3>
<p>We believe in responsible production. We compensate for all CO2 emitted making and shipping our knives 10 times over. Last year we compensated more than 33.000 kg of CO2. That's about as much as a car driven around the planet 9 times. We do this because we believe companies should take responsibility for their emissions. </p>
<p>We invest in tree planting projects to offset our carbon footprint 10 times. Planting trees is an effective way to compensate for carbon emissions. A tree absorbs C02 from the air and releases oxygen during its lifetime. Trees also provide a habitat for various species of animals. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Strip</strong></p>
<p>Our magnet strip makes sure your knives are stored safely and will not get damaged banging around in a drawer.  Easily holds your full set. Made from natural Acacia hardwood. The magnet strip measures 45 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm (17.7 x 2.5 x 1 inch). Mounting hardware is included!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Block</strong></p>
<p>Ahh yes, the block... a 4 kg heavy, solid wood, magnetic knife block. A commercial nightmare. Expensive to manufacture, and difficult to ship. Try telling that to an engineer who just spent the afternoon gleefully thinking up formulas to find the optimal width to height ratio and magnetic holding force for a knife block. </p>
<p>Traditional knife blocks have three big issues:</p>
<p>They get unsanitary on the inside because you can not clean the slots.  </p>
<p>You can never see what knife you are reaching for. </p>
<p>You have a fixed number of slots, which means you can't store any extra knives. </p>
<p>Max tried to solve all the problems at once.  So after 26 concepts (yes, really, 26 different knife blocks), Max concluded that the most efficient solution to these problems is to have a solid wood block with magnets on all sides.  It's super easy to clean and it can store all the knives you'll ever need in plain sight. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623181631/ssyjxqwf16pvxajldwav.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our first reaction was;  can't we make it a little smaller? To which Max's reaction was a list of formulas that proved any smaller or lighter would result in the block tipping when grabbing a knife. At the end of the day, the numbers man is usually right. Therefore the block measures 27 x 15 x 15 cm (10.5 x 6 x 6 inch).</p>
<p>So that is how we ended up with a solid 8-pound knife block. We absolutely love the look and feel, and (especially Max) would love to ship them to you. However, we can't produce the block in small batches due to the tooling cost. This is why it is a stretch goal that will be unlocked if we're lucky enough to reach €200.000,-.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>How We Got Here</strong></h3>
<p>We have spent the last year developing knives and testing prototypes. We asked our backers for feedback and used their input to guide our process. By testing and redesigning we make sure each knife is perfectly engineered for its specific purpose.</p>
<p>We have improved our manufacturing process to ensure every knife is razor-sharp right out of the box. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623181664/seuk7mbaohtodcrnkras.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>Materials have been sourced, designs have been finalized and our manufacturing partner in China is ready to rock. We need to produce a large volume of knives to be able to sell our set at the incredible discount we're offering. Only through volume, we are able to reduce production costs to the point that you get the knives you deserve for the BARE minimum. (pun intended)</p>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<p>We'll ship all rewards January. Our main focus is quality, we stand behind our products. We'll not ship a single knife until we are satisfied it exceeds our quality standards.  On our last campaign, we shipped about a month later than planned due to the global pandemic, despite our best efforts. This time around we're starting our campaign a month earlier to ensure we're able to deliver on time. </p>

</div></div>","Due to Popular Demand
Last year we introduced BARE Knives. High-quality, affordable, and sustainable cookware.  We were blown away to reach our funding goal within 24 hours. Since then we've been getting emails asking when we would produce more knife types.  So, not wanting to disappoint, we're back. And we have all the knives you'll ever need!
  
We've spent the last year testing, redesigning, and retesting. We're ready to introduce BARE Knives 2.0. The be-all and end-all of knife sets. Our knives are razor-sharp, carbon-negative, and come with a lifetime warranty. The mountain pattern on each knife stops most foods from sticking. And honestly, it just looks gorgeous. 
You'll buy directly from us. With no middlemen and a crowdfunding volume discount, you get an incredible one-time-only price.
 

What Our Backers Say
We are very proud of a 4.7 / 5.0 average rating from our backers. Our previous campaign was a success thanks to our amazing backers. We have used all their feedback in designing our knife set and improving our products.

 

But My Butter Knife Also Works?
Sure, you can cut a sirloin steak with a cheap plastic paring knife and some elbow grease. You might even enjoy the steak. But what if we could make slicing that steak enjoyable too!? And that's just it, you're supposed to enjoy cooking. 
Before you know it, you'll even want to slice some vegetables! We all know: homemade food is healthier food. We want you to enjoy cooking. And with the right tools, it's even faster than ordering in.


 
The Right Knife For The Job
A good set of kitchen knives will last you a lifetime. To ensure every kitchen task is covered we designed a 5-piece knife set. Check out the sharp details that make each knife unique!

These five knives combined, cover the complete spectrum of kitchen tasks.  There are, however, two additional knives we absolutely love. 

The Nakiri is perfect for cutting straight slices or julienne. It's the perfect vegetable knife. The Kiritsuke on the other hand excels at meat and fish. Cutting sashimi or a large piece of meat, this 10-inch sword makes easy work of it.
We are aware you might have never heard of these knives, and probably have never seen the need for them. But we know how amazing and unique these knives are and we want you to have them. Because we reached our stretch goals, everyone who pledged for a 5 piece set will receive these knives for free.  These knives make cooking so much more fun. We would feel bad not getting them to you.
 

How We Maintain An Honest Price
Traditionally retailers mark up the products they sell between 50 and 100%. This means you could be paying double for the same goods. This doesn't sit right with us.
Separately these 5 knives will cost more than €300,-.  If we reach our stretch goals the 7 knives you'll receive have a combined MSRP of €483! We're offering our complete set to you for only €149,-. We can offer you this price because we ship directly to you, unlike traditional retailers. No middlemen or retailer markup means more knives for your money. 
With your pledges, we are able to manufacture a large batch of knives. Because of the large batch size, we are able to reduce production costs. This means even more discount.

What Makes Our Knives Great
We have designed our knives for a lifetime of use. Below you can find all the nitty-gritty design details. 

 
Our Manufacturing Process
Under tremendous pressure and heat, a steel blank is imprinted with our unique mountain pattern. This does three things. Firstly, through a mechanism called 'work hardening', it hardens the surface of the knife steel. Secondly, the mountain pattern reduces surface tension during cutting, which means food does not stick as much. Lastly, the mountain pattern signifies our sustainable approach. 
The blanks are then reheated, quenched, and tempered to 58HRC. Next, we grind the primary bevel under continuous water cooling. After fitting and finishing the hardwood handle our knives are sharpened by hand.

 
Sustainable Production
We believe in responsible production. We compensate for all CO2 emitted making and shipping our knives 10 times over. Last year we compensated more than 33.000 kg of CO2. That's about as much as a car driven around the planet 9 times. We do this because we believe companies should take responsibility for their emissions. 
We invest in tree planting projects to offset our carbon footprint 10 times. Planting trees is an effective way to compensate for carbon emissions. A tree absorbs C02 from the air and releases oxygen during its lifetime. Trees also provide a habitat for various species of animals. 

 
The Rewards

 
Add-ons 


 
The Strip
Our magnet strip makes sure your knives are stored safely and will not get damaged banging around in a drawer.  Easily holds your full set. Made from natural Acacia hardwood. The magnet strip measures 45 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm (17.7 x 2.5 x 1 inch). Mounting hardware is included!
 
The Block
Ahh yes, the block... a 4 kg heavy, solid wood, magnetic knife block. A commercial nightmare. Expensive to manufacture, and difficult to ship. Try telling that to an engineer who just spent the afternoon gleefully thinking up formulas to find the optimal width to height ratio and magnetic holding force for a knife block. 
Traditional knife blocks have three big issues:
They get unsanitary on the inside because you can not clean the slots.  
You can never see what knife you are reaching for. 
You have a fixed number of slots, which means you can't store any extra knives. 
Max tried to solve all the problems at once.  So after 26 concepts (yes, really, 26 different knife blocks), Max concluded that the most efficient solution to these problems is to have a solid wood block with magnets on all sides.  It's super easy to clean and it can store all the knives you'll ever need in plain sight. 

Our first reaction was;  can't we make it a little smaller? To which Max's reaction was a list of formulas that proved any smaller or lighter would result in the block tipping when grabbing a knife. At the end of the day, the numbers man is usually right. Therefore the block measures 27 x 15 x 15 cm (10.5 x 6 x 6 inch).
So that is how we ended up with a solid 8-pound knife block. We absolutely love the look and feel, and (especially Max) would love to ship them to you. However, we can't produce the block in small batches due to the tooling cost. This is why it is a stretch goal that will be unlocked if we're lucky enough to reach €200.000,-.
 
How We Got Here
We have spent the last year developing knives and testing prototypes. We asked our backers for feedback and used their input to guide our process. By testing and redesigning we make sure each knife is perfectly engineered for its specific purpose.
We have improved our manufacturing process to ensure every knife is razor-sharp right out of the box. 

 
What We Need
Materials have been sourced, designs have been finalized and our manufacturing partner in China is ready to rock. We need to produce a large volume of knives to be able to sell our set at the incredible discount we're offering. Only through volume, we are able to reduce production costs to the point that you get the knives you deserve for the BARE minimum. (pun intended)
Timeline
We'll ship all rewards January. Our main focus is quality, we stand behind our products. We'll not ship a single knife until we are satisfied it exceeds our quality standards.  On our last campaign, we shipped about a month later than planned due to the global pandemic, despite our best efforts. This time around we're starting our campaign a month earlier to ensure we're able to deliver on time. 

 
Customer Service
We believe in customer care. We aim to make sure everyone who supports us by backing our campaign gets exactly what they were promised.  Anything less is unacceptable. Don't believe us? Below are few reviews we received on our last campaign. 

 
About Us
Four years ago we started BARE Cookware with the goal to develop high-quality and sustainable cookware. We think that having good tools is half the work, and we want everyone to be able to afford good tools. 
We're of the opinion that cooking can and should be fun. Having the right tools can make it even more fun.  Having fun in the kitchen makes leading a healthy lifestyle easy!

We used the feedback of our amazing community to develop the ultimate set of kitchen knives. Taking good care of our knives makes them last a lifetime. Therefore we have created a learning center on our website which covers all knife-related topics. From cutting techniques to sharpening tips to hardwood handle maintenance. We've got you covered.

<p>Please see the images below indicating the changes and why they have improved Coffeejack.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>1. Increased Volume of Water Chamber by over 20%.</strong> Now holds 90ml for those wanting a larger coffee, its your choice.</p>
<p><strong>2. New Valve System. </strong>Instead of using metal ball bearings, springs and o-ring seals we have now moved to an all silicone system. This means improved user interaction when replacing valve seals and increased reliability.</p>
<p><strong>3. Depth of Coffee Basket. </strong>This is a really important upgrade as it means an increased coffee yield for a given cup without basket obstruction. It also means a wider range of glasses/mugs can be used as it better accommodates the wall taper of the cup. We had to move around all the existing internals to make this improvement which meant a complete design overhaul.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594377817/t1se1k4dbyvyphy1fk7l.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>4. Custom Branded ‘Soft Place’ Rubber. </strong>This means a silent, seamless transition when placing Coffeejack on the rim of a coffee cup. It also spreads the load whilst pumping, preventing any movement/ scratches on the cup or elevation stand.</p>
<p><strong>5. Rubber Grip.</strong> Provides extra grip when twisting the coffee basket onto the bayonets. We found this useful when components are wet after being washed or in rainy/cold conditions.</p>
<p><strong>6. Anti Drip Valve. </strong>On occasions, Coffeejack left the odd drip if all the water had not passed through the puck. Please note this valve does not prevent the system from being an unpressurised portafilter. Its shore hardness is only high enough to retain a water droplet. Additionally it provides air-tight freshness when storing the grind in our coffee basket carry case.</p>
<p><strong>7. Soft Place Rubber. </strong>Prevents movement on a flat surface and provides a luxurious feel when placing on a table. This is a fine but noticeable detail for many quality products.</p>

<p><strong>8. Rubber Seal. </strong>This has two purposes, first being that it will fully seal the chamber from unwanted dust/dirt during transit. This keeps the water chamber clean at all times. Secondly, it provides a ‘smooth rotation’ feel when locking the lid in the closed position.</p>
<p><strong>9. Heavy duty Locking Mechanism.</strong> Although the old design worked, we had concerns about it breaking if it were to be mistreated. This design adds further protection incase any tiny hands find your Coffeejack!</p>

<p><strong>10. Piston Lock. </strong>This feature locks both the lid and the piston in a secure closed position. This is important as these robust features must hold the internal compression spring in the loaded position.</p>
<p><strong>11. Safety Water Trap. </strong>This is an additional component to the original design. If Coffeejack is knocked from the side, the downward facing chamfers prevent water splashing upwards. Whilst it protects against water splashes, it also allows water refill without removing the component every time.</p>
<p><strong>12. Full Width Water Spreader.</strong> Increasing water flow area therefore improving espresso taste quality.</p>
<p>The design improvements above mean extra cost for us, not for you. You will receive a far superior product to the one you originally backed.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, we are contracting the expertise of a professional packaging design company. This means Coffeejack will arrive in highly presentable, gift worthy packaging with full instructions for use.</p>
<p>We appreciate packaging is a concern for many backers in that you may not want this for environmental reasons. We commend this view and will be sending a survey nearer the time of delivery where you will be able to opt-out of packaging if desired.

We’ve essentially been able to release ‘Coffeejack Version 2’ for you all by utilising the COVID-19 lockdown time to make some fantastic design upgrades. Many of these features were suggested by backers so thank you for your feedback throughout the project.
Please see the images below indicating the changes and why they have improved Coffeejack.

 
1. Increased Volume of Water Chamber by over 20%. Now holds 90ml for those wanting a larger coffee, its your choice.
2. New Valve System. Instead of using metal ball bearings, springs and o-ring seals we have now moved to an all silicone system. This means improved user interaction when replacing valve seals and increased reliability.
3. Depth of Coffee Basket. This is a really important upgrade as it means an increased coffee yield for a given cup without basket obstruction. It also means a wider range of glasses/mugs can be used as it better accommodates the wall taper of the cup. We had to move around all the existing internals to make this improvement which meant a complete design overhaul.

4. Custom Branded ‘Soft Place’ Rubber. This means a silent, seamless transition when placing Coffeejack on the rim of a coffee cup. It also spreads the load whilst pumping, preventing any movement/ scratches on the cup or elevation stand.
5. Rubber Grip. Provides extra grip when twisting the coffee basket onto the bayonets. We found this useful when components are wet after being washed or in rainy/cold conditions.
6. Anti Drip Valve. On occasions, Coffeejack left the odd drip if all the water had not passed through the puck. Please note this valve does not prevent the system from being an unpressurised portafilter. Its shore hardness is only high enough to retain a water droplet. Additionally it provides air-tight freshness when storing the grind in our coffee basket carry case.
7. Soft Place Rubber. Prevents movement on a flat surface and provides a luxurious feel when placing on a table. This is a fine but noticeable detail for many quality products.

8. Rubber Seal. This has two purposes, first being that it will fully seal the chamber from unwanted dust/dirt during transit. This keeps the water chamber clean at all times. Secondly, it provides a ‘smooth rotation’ feel when locking the lid in the closed position.
9. Heavy duty Locking Mechanism. Although the old design worked, we had concerns about it breaking if it were to be mistreated. This design adds further protection incase any tiny hands find your Coffeejack!

10. Piston Lock. This feature locks both the lid and the piston in a secure closed position. This is important as these robust features must hold the internal compression spring in the loaded position.
11. Safety Water Trap. This is an additional component to the original design. If Coffeejack is knocked from the side, the downward facing chamfers prevent water splashing upwards. Whilst it protects against water splashes, it also allows water refill without removing the component every time.
12. Full Width Water Spreader. Increasing water flow area therefore improving espresso taste quality.
The design improvements above mean extra cost for us, not for you. You will receive a far superior product to the one you originally backed.
In addition to the above, we are contracting the expertise of a professional packaging design company. This means Coffeejack will arrive in highly presentable, gift worthy packaging with full instructions for use.
We appreciate packaging is a concern for many backers in that you may not want this for environmental reasons. We commend this view and will be sending a survey nearer the time of delivery where you will be able to opt-out of packaging if desired.

Many, many prototypes later and we cracked it!All design work and machining prototypes have been done by ourselves. We also have a very good relationship with our manufacturers and talk on a daily basis. This is essential to ensure we can easily monitor production and ensure the very best quality.Thank you for your time.",41.0,3,"1 Campaign

We had a blast doing local events such as Celebrate Holyoke, the Holyoke Canoe Club Brewfest, the Volleyball Hall of Fame fundraiser, The Plan Grand Opening, Big Brother Big Sister Brews and Bites fundraiser, The Worthy Fest, and many more. With every event we felt as though our presence was growing.

Our Brewing Guide began as a humble way to share tips for making delicious coffee at home during the pandemic but has since grown into a worldwide representation of the people behind every cup. We found that the coffee world was missing information and educative opportunities. The culinary world offers varieties of cookbooks and recipes from different chefs, but there was no equivalent for coffee products. The I'M NOT A BARISTA brewing guide is exactly that – a collection of recipes, tested by coffee experts and skilled home brewers, for you to level up your coffee experience. We believe that anyone can brew and that everyone deserves good coffee. This is not just about the brewing recipes – it is about connecting you on a global scale with talented individuals who want to share their knowledge and technique for better brews. Our goal is to spread the love for drinking coffee around the world and to empower baristas - those we know by name and those we want to shine a light on.  There is nothing that delights us more than seeing our baristas and coffee lovers progress and be able to get their voices heard. It is honouring to know that we have been part of the process, but we want to do more. We would like to provide financial aid to members of our coffee community who have been immensely affected by the pandemic. In this, we will launch our #Tipabarista charity project and make donations to help baristas in need.  We are aware that $100 for each barista won’t give a chance to turn around a business or get anyone too far, but we hope to provide some relief, happiness, and most importantly, hope. You are not alone, and we believe in you as professionals as well as human beings.We firmly believe in being transparent with our followers and donors. To do so, we have linked a page from our website that details our donation status, with all necessary details regarding our incoming funds and their allocation. Click here for more info. Today we live in a world dominated by social media, and sometimes, it can be hard to switch off. 2020 felt like a constant flow of negative news. This year, it seems that life is only getting more overwhelming. We believe that coffee can always bring some peace to our daily lives. Brewing a cup of coffee in the morning can serve as a moment of calm, and a time to reflect and relax. 
Each card represents so much more than a recipe: it is a vehicle for connection in these lonely times. Each card represents a real coffee lover or a barista champion who you can reach out to, whether because you want to learn from them, show gratitude for their work or simply bond over your shared passion for coffee. Nothing is more powerful than this connection.

 

 
The brewing guide consists of forty-eight recipe cards from baristas around the world. These recipes are based upon community-verified and hand-selected major brewing methods:AeroPress, Pour-over, French Press, or a Moka pot… Some cards also provide step-by-step visual instruction to help new home brewers.Each card represents so much more than a recipe: it is a vehicle for connection in these lonely times. Each card represents a real coffee lover or a barista champion who you can reach out to, to follow their work, share your thoughts on their brews, and bond over your love of coffee. Nothing is more powerful than this connection.  Make music a part of your brewing experience - we asked recipe owners for their favorite brewing music, and we created an irresistible Spotify playlist to enhance your brewing routine. A compilation of forty-eight songs hand-picked by each of our collaborators, our aim is to make your brewing experience one that is peaceful and intimate. Each recipe comes with a specific song track to recreate the exact experience. To browse this playlist, scan the code below with your Spotify App.  To better help you connect with the coffee community, we have also added a QR code on each card to help you easily find the barista behind the recipe. If you really like the recipe, scan the QR code and connect. That being said, we understand that not everyone can afford to support our project. However, we believe everyone deserves good coffee - if you want to share any recipe, simply scan the code and share it with your friends. This is not a one-time project that ends after the campaign. It is only the beginning, and we want to invite you to join us in our future projects. After trying all of these wonderful recipes, don't you want to share yours with us?For this purpose, we prepared a special card just for you. Sharing is caring, so write down your favourite recipe and share it with the world. The cards are symbolic of our community’s effort to create a collaborative product. 30 countries, 27 languages, 110 recipe testers, 10 volunteers, and 10 student interns, and literally thousands of hours.Instagram / Linkedin / Facebook / Patreon

We're BOLT. We created the world’s first modular heated mug designed to go in the dishwasher. To never deal with cold cups of coffee ever again, preorder your very own BOLT by clicking Back This Project or read on to learn more! Most temperature controlled mugs are over-engineered, expensive, underperforming, and a pain to use.  BOLT is a completely portable and rechargeable heated 10oz mug that maintains your drink at three ideal temperatures for 4+ hours.BOLT is a completely portable and rechargeable heated mug.  At 11oz (10oz if you like adding cream) the BOLT maintains your drink at three ideal temperatures for 4+ hours. Unlike other solutions that barely last an hour, for the average coffee drinker it means you’ll only have to charge the BOLT twice per week. This dramatically reduces the cycle strain on the battery and drastically increases the life of the BOLT.   Control the temperature of your coffee or tea using simple capacitive one-touch controls.
Press and hold for any temperature setting
Tap-to-Wake LED panel
15s auto-dim lighting system to reduce glare and conserve battery life 
Touch panel deactivates after 10s if no temperature is set to avoid accidental activations
How to Use the BOLT - A Simple Demonstration    BOLT is designed to all UL safety standards required for certification. It features an automatic shut-off in the base if no liquid or mug is present to make the BOLT safe to use at all times and to conserve battery life.  To regulate any liquid at a warm temperature you either have to A) add heat (energy) to the liquid or B) keep its existing heat from dissipating. BOLT does both. The BOLT MugTop is engineered with the most effective insulation system that features a double walled static air gap design and a food grade stainless steel inner liner that conducts and radiates heat back into the liquid. By prioritizing insulation within the MugTop, our engineering team was freed to create an intelligent base housing liquid level sensors, thermostatic controls and a light, yet powerful lithium ion battery. This combination provides more than enough heat to keep your drink warm for 4+ hours. Longer than any other heated mug on the market!  Using a bayonet mount, the BOLT Base and MugTop can be attached/detached with one easy click. Attach a fresh MugTop to an the existing base with plenty of remaining charge or swap in a new base with a full battery for that never-ending office meeting.  No clutter and no stationary charger required.   The easily detachable MugTop is completely inert, sealed, and 100% waterproof. No handwashing needed. Just click, toss and go. Let the dishwasher do the rest. Any BOLT MugTop can be swapped out with a clean one while the dishwasher cycle is running. All MugTops are compatible wth the BOLT Base, regardless of colour. Each MugTop features a scratch-resistant, hair-brushed stainless steel surface that ensures whatever you drink from the BOLT tastes exactly how it’s supposed to taste.The inert steel drinkware won’t chip, flake or corrode in your dishwasher, and you won’t end up with flecks of anything in your drink, or most importantly, your mouth. The slim and lightweight design of the base blends seamlessly into the MugTop creating a sleek look and is easy to take anywhere. All mounting components are on the internal edge of the MugTop and Base, allowing you to store and use the MugTop as you would any other mug.  Designed to fit under any standard counter coffee maker or espresso machine, the BOLT’s non-slip base prevents slips and spills. On the go? All BOLT MugTops come with a silicon gasketed Travel Lid to keep the cold out and your drink in. *You can select any colour option or combination of full unit colours at any perk level* When engineering the BOLT, we didn't want to include some proprietary charging cord, cable, disk, plate or adapter that could only be used by the BOLT and the BOLT alone. Our users will be able to transport their BOLT worry free between the home and the office, even if you forget the charger behind.So we made the BOLT smart enough to charge with any USB Type C chargers. 75% of the world uses Android phones, so odds are you ALREADY have a charger that works with the BOLT.

But brewing an amazing cup of coffee doesn’t always seem worth it: unpacking your pour-over setup, washing everything, carefully measuring and grinding, making a mess in the kitchen, and worst of all it still doesn’t always come out the way you want it.But a wise barista makes use of all the tools available- enter the Gevi 2-in-1, an all-in-one coffee grinder, and pour-over coffee machine, each element held to the most exacting professional-grade standards.We’ve sent the first batch of prototypes to some professional baristas. Stay tuned for more unboxing videos and special recipes!Coffee lovers know, grinding your coffee fresh for every cup provides the most flavor possible, and is a vitally important part of any kind of coffee process. Gevi begins with a commercial-grade burr grinding system featuring 60mm flat burrs, 51-step grind settings, and a built-in digital scale. It’s designed to provide the optimum coffee grounds with close to zero retention. Simplify your coffee-making routine, save counter space, and start making gold-standard cups of coffee, today.When choosing a grinder, perhaps no virtue is as important as consistency- it helps you refine your technique and prevents distortion of your coffee’s flavors. That’s why, unlike traditional conical burr grinders, Gevi uses flat burrs to create more uniform micro-grounds and allow you to extract the maximum flavor, without heating up and distorting the flavor of your beans.And, our high torque motor turns slowly for cool, quiet operation, so you won’t have to wake up the entire house to brew yourself a cup of coffee.Different brewing methods need different grounds. It’s not enough to be consistent if you lack flexibility. That’s why Gevi's rotatable dial allows for 51 distinct grind settings, and it can process a wider variety of coffee beans to produce many different extraction levels. This way, you have complete control over exactly how your grounds turn out, every time, for any drink you like.Additionally, the built-in scale provides automatic weight sensing and real-time display on the screen, for easy adjustment while experimenting or replicating your favorite recipe.Gevi allows users to customize the grind function to exactly match their needs. You can select the number of cups to be made, or the grind time, or the weight of beans. Still too complicated? The Free Mode is the most straightforward way to get coffee grounds from beans. Just pause or resume anytime you want, without having to fill in any information. Additionally, the flat burr grinders are removable for easy cleaning, and are rated to last for 529 lbs of coffee beans! We estimate replacements won’t be needed for at least five years. The technique for perfect pour-over coffee is straightforward and fun, but it requires a long time to perfect, and every iteration takes time and focus. Gevi is here to help you easily, quickly, and reliably reach that level.The Gevi automatic mode is designed to ensure every cup achieves the Gold Cup Standard. Users only need to input 3 steps in Automatic Mode, so you won’t have to worry about hand grinding your beans, blooming grounds manually, or carefully monitoring the temperature, angle, and speed of each pour- Gevi can take care of all that for you!Gevi’s team of baristas have done the work to set up a variety of presets to simulate the manual pouring of an experienced barista - we call it Gevi-Standard Baristial Coffee. You can get the same world-class quality for less attention and no matter your experience level, with Gevi.  Besides, we are already in the application process of ECBC  (European Coffee Brewing Centre) Gold Cup Certification to advance its own Barista mode even further.Gevi uses three jet spouts that can rotate up to 360° and pour from 3 inches up, mimicking the movements of an experienced barista to ensure all coffee grounds come into contact with the water, for maximum flavor extraction. Sometimes you don’t want a standard recipe, instead, you need to just take things into your own hands. Gevi is a perfect backup, capable of exactly following your lead. In barista mode, every part of the grinding, heating, blooming, and brewing process can be sped up, slowed down, or even paused while you consider the next step in your masterwork. From the rotation speed and height of your pour to the temperature of the water, Gevi can help you experiment to find what best suits your taste.Instead of following a recipe, use the progress bars and digital graphs to customize the process by feel. Try new combinations of brew ratios, brew speeds, and bloom times, then save them for future use. Virtually every part of the coffee-making experience can be saved and perfectly replicated whenever you need it to deliver unmatched consistency every time.Found something that works for you? Give the recipe a name so you can call it up quickly, any time you like. Every time you feel like it, you can reproduce it perfectly, on-demand. Find something especially good? Share your unique recipe with a friend! Miss the cafe bonding experience? Gevi helps you share the exact same cup of copy, at the same time, with a loved one no matter where they are.  Any high-performance machine needs occasional maintenance, and Gevi’s descaling mode makes it easy and painless. Simply add a certain amount of the descaler into the water tank and start cleaning. You can also click ""second cycle"" to begin the next round.The Gevi comes with a cleaning brush and a coffee scoop neatly tucked away inside the hopper’s lid, so you’ll have everything you need to keep everything ship-shape.Not at your best before your morning coffee? Gevi’s Beginner Mode displays instruction screens to guide you through the process. Experienced users can use Master Mode instead for a quicker experience, once they’ve got the hang of things.There’s nothing worse than an obnoxiously loud coffee grinder waking up the whole house early in the morning. Not only does Gevi offer premium grinding quality, but we also understand how important quiet grinders can be for those early mornings. The Gevi grinding process takes less than a minute, and best of all the noise level is kept under 70 dB the whole time.The constant temperature control system maintains water temperature at the desired brew temperature so you never risk scorching your coffee, and it warms up in under four minutes, saving you precious time in the mornings. You will have the option to choose the color after you choose a specific perk on the right top of the page.  Please check the complete specs in the google sheet below, which includes not only the specs of the grinder and the brewer separately, but also the specific parameters for the machine recipe under Auto Mode in terms of the brew ratio, water volume, brew speed, bloom time, etc. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HtU1Aa9AeH09eN...Established in 2017, Gevi is a kitchen appliance brand from the USA that believes strongly in innovative design. Currently, the Gevi series produces coffee machines, air fryers, toasters, juicers, electric kettles, and more. They are sold in more than 30 countries, improving the quality of life for more than 1.5 million consumers across the USA, Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. Gevi has always strived to provide high-quality and reliable products for all our customers. For the past year and a half, our team has been working day and night to develop the Gevi 2-in-1 Coffee Grinder & Pour-over Machine. We visited more than a hundred pour-over coffee lovers and professionals to better understand their needs and concerns about using coffee machines, and we’ve worked hard to provide you with the best solution on the market today. We stand behind our products & services with full confidence. Gevi warranties the product for 1 year and will provide customer service to answer technical questions. Gevi will also warrant that each product purchased is free from defects in materials and workmanship, under normal use during the limited warranty period. *Please note that the warranty period complies with the applicable consumer laws in the consumer's country of purchase required.We've already entered into the mass production stage with Indiegogo’s official verification. The estimated shipping will start in October. FREE shipping and no extra custom fee for orders to the US, CA & AU. We will first ship the products to local warehouses and then ship to backers through the local delivery options. For orders to UK and the most of countries in EU. Due to the new policy of VAT and customs fees, it’s difficult for us to cover all the costs after having provided the largest discount and covering a proportion of the shipping fees. So we will charge an additional 100USD for each machine for logistics with customs fees included. For orders to other countries and regions, we will ship the packages via air express directly, and charge a specific amount of shipping fee based on different shipping addresses. Overview on Functions

We have far too many similar items in our kitchen & bathroom.

To preserve Nature, we must drastically reduce our production of single-use products & daily products. We have to reduce our mass production.
We need more durable products.
This is why we created Scrubbio: to replace all similar and single-use products with only a simple product, thereby considerably reducing our production.This product replaces many other products in your home and will decrease global production. You could also keep it and use it for years. Scrubbio is made with a recyclable & ultra-durable silicone.    We must reduce our production of products to save nature. We have to produce durable and recyclable items easily.                      So FUN! Throw SCRUBBIO on any metal surface you want as a fridge or a credenza.                        Please note: We don't have a lot of Oranges in stock anymore.

A food business in Albuquerque with a focus on familiar and comforting dishes that are 100% vegan. We launched Vegos May 2019 at the local grower’s market with nothing but a couple tables and delicious food. From there we’ve grown into two food trucks and acquired as well as outfitted our very own commissary kitchen. In two years time, we have grown from a two-person team, into an six-person crew. Despite 2020’s hardships we worked harder than ever to serve our community. In this year, we won third best food truck in the city and second best chef by local paper Albuquerque Journal. In May 2021, only two years from our debut, we won Best Food Truck in the state of New Mexico by the Edible Magazine. We are humbled by these awards but know there is much more to achieve and much much more to cook! It is our goal to serve the community more consistently by offering a brick and mortar location.</p><h3><strong>How do we get there</strong></h3><p>With the great growth we’ve had in the last two years, it has come at a cost. We have invested $30k of our own money and we are paying on loans of $24k we have taken out to make this dream a reality. Because of these financial responsibilities it has slowed growth and the possibility of offering a storefront option to our customers. We can continue to serve through our food trucks but we would really love to showcase our kitchen and have a stable location with plenty of parking for everyone. We are asking your help to renovate our existing kitchen space into a beautiful walk-up option. We are asking for help with the renovations to transform this old pie shop into Albuquerque’s number one destination for vegan New Mexican food. This renovation would widely open our menu and allow us to whip up even more tasty dishes. Here’s the breakdown:</p><p>Total Space: 1,000 sq ft</p><ul>
<li>Signage: $4,000</li>
<li>Décor/Furnishings: $4,000</li>
<li>Wifi/POS System/Security: $2,300</li>
<li>Menu board/ordering counter/cabinets/lighting/waiting area: $12,000</li>
<li>Total before tax: $22,300</li>
</ul><p>We would love to offer as much seating as possible but with the limited space we will only be able to offer a waiting area at this time. However, having a brick and mortar location means we will no longer have to cancel service because of crazy wind or inclement weather. This also means, our menu is no longer restricted by what can and cannot be transported to our food trailer, which means fewer sell out days!</p><h3><strong>What it's all about</strong></h3><p>At Vegos our mission has always been to deliver delicious hearty vegan dishes that don’t break the bank. We want our customers to walk away feeling full and satisfied. We make food that appeals to everyone, omnivores and vegans alike! We believe good food is good food! We are passionate about food and believe it is important to show people through delicious flavors and textures just how satisfying a fully plant-based meal can be. We often hear things like “I can’t believe this is vegan” or “I don’t even miss the meat” and those are huge wins! But we think the greatest “win” of all is when our customers share our name with their friends and families.</p><h3><strong>We're turning heads</strong></h3><p>We believe in Vegos and people seem to believe in us too! 2020 was a tough year for a lot of businesses, ours included. However, we hustled and served as many days as we could, and at however many locations we could. Last year required adaptability in order to survive, and not only did we survive but we grew! In 2020 our Seitan Burrito was recognized by PETA as one of the Top 10 burritos in the country. This national recognition gained notice from our local community and we were featured in our local newspaper the Albuquerque Journal. In November 2020 we were listed as the top 10 local destinations for tamales in Albuquerque and we've been featured in the New Mexico magazine as a plant-based destination. From there we were voted 3rd Best Food Truck in the city and Elizabeth was voted 2nd Best Chef in the city! At the time we were only a year old but we kept pushing. We credit a large amount of our success to our amazing customers but also to our determination to succeed! In May of 2021 we were named The Best Food Truck in the State of New Mexico by National Publication the Edible Magazine and we are seeking to raise funds to help us grow even more! </p><p>There is no doubt that this industry can be challenging and hard but we believe we’ve proven our willingness to overcome adversity, even in the wake of overwhelmingly difficult odds. We love our community and know that this town deserves more. Raising these funds would mean we would have a centrally located kitchen, for our customers to easily reach us. Our kitchen is located on Carlisle Blvd between Montgomery Blvd and Comanche in the old NM Pie Company space. It's a 5 minute drive to either interstate, making is easily accessible. While we would love a space that offers seating, our current kitchen is just too small for that. Instead,  this space offers customers the option to walk up and place their order with us on a consistent basis. Unlike the food truck world, where people have to check our website and social media pages to see where we are located, this space would give them a dependable place to go to grab their vegan comfort food.  We believe in Vegos and we are dedicated to serving our community. We would love your help in making this dream a reality! Let us serve you in a walk-up brick and mortar location! </p><h3><strong>How do we make dining space a reality now?</strong></h3><p>There is a vacancy in the space next to us that used to be an old hair salon for 20+ years. The idea would be to knock down part of the wall and connect our current space with this new one. We would transform the old hair salon building into a beautiful dining room and we would use our current space to expand our kitchen. To be honest this was our initial goal. We worked with a contractor and got the following specs. The price was higher than we were hoping for which is why this campaign is targeted toward renovating our existing space instead, a much more affordable project. However, in the interest of transparency we wanted to share the following numbers with you. If you were hoping for Vegos to turn into a sit down dining restaurant, there is a way! If we are able to raise the following funds then Vegos could build a beautiful dining area for guests to enjoy their tasty New Mexican cuisine in. </p><p>Total Space: 1,200 sq ft</p><p>Seating to start: up to 48 ppl</p><ul>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> Jack-B's is a tiny 100% Takeout restaurant located in the heart of Downtown Findlay.  It is owned by husband and wife:  Brenden and Sherie Butler.</p>
<p>The restaurant is named after  Brenden's Dad:  Jack Butler, who died of Esophageal cancer in 2004.  Brenden was very close to his Father, and he has always had a passion for cooking and the food industry. Before Brenden moved back to be with his dying Father in 2004, he was close to starting up a new Restaurant/Cafe in Ft. Myer's Beach, FL.</p>
<p>Brenden chose to walk away from that opportunity in order to spend time with his Dad during his last days on earth.  His dream from that point forward, and promise to his Dad, was to run his own restaurant, and name the business after his Father.</p>

<li>If we exceed our goal, funds will be reinvested into both Jack-B's locations, and/or a Food Truck.  Jack-B's has big plans, but this is only the beginning. We can't do it without you and we are looking forward to serving you some more Jack-B's Goodness-To-Go!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>Available and Affordable Locations are VERY hard to find.  We have already had our eye on a few places in town, but later found they were simply unattainable.</li>
<li> Planning, licenses, inspections and regulations can all throw up potential problems, but that is always unknown until you come up against it.</li>
<li>The Pandemic has altered the restaurant industry.  We understand that staffing issues currently continue to be a problem.  Our model has survived because we are able to run our business with low overhead. </li>
</ul>
<p>. We understand there is always the potential for problems, but we are determined and dedicated to push forward no matter what.  We are willing to take on the risks and challenges.</p>
<p> </p>

Your support is essential to our success.  Thank you so much for reading and learning about our campaign.
If we exceed our goal, funds will be reinvested into both Jack-B's locations, and/or a Food Truck.  Jack-B's has big plans, but this is only the beginning. We can't do it without you and we are looking forward to serving you some more Jack-B's Goodness-To-Go!

 
Risks & Challenges


Available and Affordable Locations are VERY hard to find.  We have already had our eye on a few places in town, but later found they were simply unattainable.
 Planning, licenses, inspections and regulations can all throw up potential problems, but that is always unknown until you come up against it.
The Pandemic has altered the restaurant industry.  We understand that staffing issues currently continue to be a problem.  Our model has survived because we are able to run our business with low overhead. 

. We understand there is always the potential for problems, but we are determined and dedicated to push forward no matter what.  We are willing to take on the risks and challenges.
 
Other Ways You Can Help

We understand that not everyone can contribute monetarily, and that is completely understandable! The good news is that there are other ways you can help! You can help spread the word about our campaign using the ""Share"" tool on this site. Also, please consider posting our link on Facebook and through Twitter or Instagram. The more the word gets out, the sooner we reach our goal and get this ball rolling! <3
 
WE APPRECIATE YOU!
Thank you again for your time and attention! There are not enough words to express how much it means to us, and how much we love our Jack-B's FAMILY!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> InKETOble! Treats is a low carb, no sugar healthy desserts company. We pride ourselves on making sweets that taste sinfully delicious you won't even know they are keto. Our journey started in September 2020  and all of the hard work is paying off and the business has taken off! We have an established presence online and at local farmers' markets and the demand has been growing ( we have reached almost 33,0000 searches on google in the last 30 days). I have decided to expand the brand and open up the first of its kind, a casual cafe and bakery that will be keto and diabetic-friendly, and low carb-focused. This will include the appetizers, entrees, alcoholic and non-alcoholic offerings, and of course the desserts.</p>

<h2>UK's First Natural-Rinded Matured Vegan Cheese</h2>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>Hey, my name is Sumear.</p>
<p>I am the hard vegan cheese &amp; long-aged cheese specialist here in Bristol, UK.</p>
<p>My job is to create authentic vegan cheese using the experience and techniques as an ex-dairy cheesemaker. By creating the cultures from scratch and understanding the science of cheesemaking, I am able to develop well rounded flavoured cheeses while achieving the right texture.</p>
<p>With flavours &amp; textures similar to dairy, there are no artificial flavours or artificial preservatives. Everything is free-from soy, miso and even free from nutritional yeast. The cultures and good old fashion dairy cheesemaking practices help develop a true natural cheese flavour without any tricks.</p>
<p>This Plantbased Creamery has become a successful at-home-business since 2018 but it is time to branch out into a new commercial space. The local &amp; loyal passionate cheese-lovers have helped make this business a success. And now it is time to branch out more across the UK.</p>
<p>The Food by Sumear cheese range has been highly rated since it started. <strong><a href=""http://foodbysumear.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check out the review over on foodbysumear.co.uk.</a></strong></p>
<p>Press Attention -<a href=""https://foodbysumear.co.uk/pages/in-the-press"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> I've been in the news as well</a>.</p>

<h3>Funding to Build the New Commercial Kitchen and Rebuilding of the Specialist Cheese Cave</h3>
<p>A new commercial building has already been purchased, and the build of the new kitchen is underway. However money is tight so the expansion project will take several months, to a year, to complete fully. The business is trading as normal with production currently taking place in the at-home location, however the new commercial location will push the business into new developments of vegan cheesemaking.</p>
<p>The expansion into a commercial premises will help increase production to meet demand, increase accessibility by lowering costs and RRPs, allowing for new products, open opportunities for employment, <strong>but more importantly bring back the UK's FIRST natural rinded matured vegan cheeses</strong>. These wonderful marvels require a hyper sensitive cheese maturing room which broke down last year. So a better version will be built in the new location.</p>
<p>While I accept the project expansion will be slow without outside funding, crowdfunding has been recommended by loyal fans to speed up the process to bring this project to life quicker, bigger and better, with high-end facilities and equipment.</p>
<p>I love developing vegan cheeses and sharing them with fellow cheese lovers but for this business and my passion to really work I need to grow bigger and quicker than ever before.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What is needed</h3>
<p>Funding of £5000 will help get the base kitchen ready in a few months and get the current range of vegan cheese out to more people and independent stockists around the UK.</p>
<p>An extra £2000 will help obtain cold-rooms for storing vast amounts of cheese to cater for more stockists.</p>
<p>An extra £10-15,000 will help pay for specialist cheese maturing experts to build the cheese cave the right way. This would indefinitely bring back the natural rind cave aged vegan cheese without any problems that occurred in 2020.</p>
<p>The business is successful, slow growing micro-business, so with any form of funding will push the business further in a positive route. The more money received means the projects that were projected to be completed next year, will be completed sooner.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risk is pretty low. The business is still strong where production is ongoing and sales are being made. The new commercial building has already been purchased with zero debt owed to anyone. A unit next door has been rented with an option to buy in two years.</p>
<p>The business reinvestments, and personal money, both equating in total to over £60,000 has already been invested in these new projects</p>
<p>With a personal financial stake in the business, the project can be deemed as low risk, with rewards purchased being zero-risk.</p>
<p>Any funding will be used in a positive manner to complete the project. The crowdfunding will help cement the business into the ground for time to come against the every growing vegan cheese industry here in the UK.</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Is nutrition holding your kid back?</span></h3>
<p><font><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;"">Most kids don't get proper nutrition. This isn't news. But youth athletes face particular challenges when it comes to getting proper nutrition. </span></font></p>
<p><font><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;"">Kids who are playing in weekend tournaments with three, four, or five games in a weekend and are practicing multiple days per week on top of that often find their fuel in one of three ways:</span></font></p>
<ul>
<li>Gas station food, concession stands, and drive-thrus</li>
<li>Sugary sports drinks</li>
<li>Energy drinks</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Fast food and concessions don't typically offer healthy or nutritious options. Some sports drinks<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> contain up to 200% of the daily recommended value of added sugars in a single bottle.</span> And energy drinks are flat out dangerous for youth athletes.</p>
<p>Time, energy, and availability make it harder than ever for youth athletes to get the healthy fuel they need to be their best. Colleges and professional sports pay millions of dollars to ensure their athletes have the right nutrition. Our kids deserve proper nutrition too. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>This is where STRONGFAST comes in.</h3>
<p>We've developed a nutritional bar based on the most current FDA recommendations for 8-15 year old athletes. The formula has been reviewed by nutritionists, pediatricians, and neuroscientists because parents and coaches should feel absolutely confident in what they are putting in their athlete’s bodies. Ingredients should be great for you, with no fluff. Nothing artificial. Nothing grown in a lab. Here are the highlights: </p>
<ul>
<li>The bar is gluten free, lactose free, non-GMO, preservative free, and free from any and all artificial colors, sweeteners, or flavors.</li>
<li>The bar tastes delicious, because flavor matters more to kids than it does to adults. </li>
<li>The bar is big, but not too big. Many bars for kids are more like snack bars for lunch boxes. They're too small to fuel athletic performance. Protein bars for adults are often too big or have high levels of certain macronutrients that can cause stomach problems.</li>
</ul>
</div><h3> </h3><h3>We're ready to get these bars into sports bags across the country.</h3><p>After a year of research and development, more than five rounds of prototypes, and reviews from food scientists, neuroscientists, pediatricians, and nutritionists, we're ready to get the STRONGFAST nutrition bar into mass production:</p><ul>
<li>We conducted a nation-wide search and spent hours in interviews and have found a co-manufacturer in Florida who has the experience, quality certifications, and passion for our project that we need to get the bars mass produced to our standards of quality.</li>
<li>The nutrition bar is gluten free, lactose free, non-GMO, preservative free, and free from any and all artificial colors, sweeteners, or flavors. We couldn't have just anyone produce it!</li>
<li>Every penny we make through this campaign will go to our initial order of product. </li>

The greatest risk in a project like this is scale. Food products like this really work best when they are being mass produced. Co-manufacturers are set up for orders of 10,000,000 easier than 10,000. The larger our order, the less our costs, the more affordable we can make the bars to consumers. </p></div>","Nutrition is essential for athletic performance.

Nothing is better than seeing your child succeed. 
You'll do anything to help your son or daughter do their best. You'll stay up late, get up early, drive them everywhere, spend money on equipment, book private lessons... the list goes on. Why do you put yourself through it?
Because nothing is better than the joy on your kid's face when their hard work pays off.
 

Is nutrition holding your kid back?
Most kids don't get proper nutrition. This isn't news. But youth athletes face particular challenges when it comes to getting proper nutrition. 
Kids who are playing in weekend tournaments with three, four, or five games in a weekend and are practicing multiple days per week on top of that often find their fuel in one of three ways:

Gas station food, concession stands, and drive-thrus
Sugary sports drinks
Energy drinks

 
Fast food and concessions don't typically offer healthy or nutritious options. Some sports drinks contain up to 200% of the daily recommended value of added sugars in a single bottle. And energy drinks are flat out dangerous for youth athletes.
Time, energy, and availability make it harder than ever for youth athletes to get the healthy fuel they need to be their best. Colleges and professional sports pay millions of dollars to ensure their athletes have the right nutrition. Our kids deserve proper nutrition too. 
 


 
This is where STRONGFAST comes in.
We've developed a nutritional bar based on the most current FDA recommendations for 8-15 year old athletes. The formula has been reviewed by nutritionists, pediatricians, and neuroscientists because parents and coaches should feel absolutely confident in what they are putting in their athlete’s bodies. Ingredients should be great for you, with no fluff. Nothing artificial. Nothing grown in a lab. Here are the highlights: 

The bar is gluten free, lactose free, non-GMO, preservative free, and free from any and all artificial colors, sweeteners, or flavors.
The bar tastes delicious, because flavor matters more to kids than it does to adults. 
The bar is big, but not too big. Many bars for kids are more like snack bars for lunch boxes. They're too small to fuel athletic performance. Protein bars for adults are often too big or have high levels of certain macronutrients that can cause stomach problems.

 We're ready to get these bars into sports bags across the country.After a year of research and development, more than five rounds of prototypes, and reviews from food scientists, neuroscientists, pediatricians, and nutritionists, we're ready to get the STRONGFAST nutrition bar into mass production:
We conducted a nation-wide search and spent hours in interviews and have found a co-manufacturer in Florida who has the experience, quality certifications, and passion for our project that we need to get the bars mass produced to our standards of quality.
The nutrition bar is gluten free, lactose free, non-GMO, preservative free, and free from any and all artificial colors, sweeteners, or flavors. We couldn't have just anyone produce it!
Every penny we make through this campaign will go to our initial order of product. 
  Every project has its share of risks. The greatest risk in a project like this is scale. Food products like this really work best when they are being mass produced. Co-manufacturers are set up for orders of 10,000,000 easier than 10,000. The larger our order, the less our costs, the more affordable we can make the bars to consumers.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

Luxurious engineering that follows you in style from the kitchen prep counter to your tabletop.
 

Whether you want a sprinkle or shower of salt, Moulin makes it effortless with 10x more output than standard mills and 10+ adjustable grind options. To top it off, its exquisite, minimalist design enhances any kitchen or dining setting. 
 
   Moulin lets you control salt size and volume with a simple twist. Instead of putting your coarse-grain, medium-grain, and finishing salts in 3 different bowls, Moulin has 10 grinding levels so you can adjust with precise granularity to the ideal size.The external dial hits everything between a fine powder (around 0) and a coarser grain (around 9). It technically goes ""below 0"" and ""above 9”, plus in between each number, giving you 50+ grind options.  0 Powder Salt — Great for adding flavor to dishes you wouldn’t want to bite into and feel a grain of salt like homemade guacamole, dips, popcorn and sauces.  3 Fine Grain Salt —Perfect for adjusting the final level of saltiness of a dish like roasted vegetables, fish or pasta, much like the use of finishing salt (fleur de sel).  5 Medium Grain Salt —A must have for seasoning meat to pull proteins out from the inside before and during cooking, helping achieve caramelization as you cook without worrying about over-salting.  9 Coarse Grain Salt —Give it a few robust turns to salt your pasta water and make it burst with flavor, akin to Gros Sel.  The Moulin Salt Mill beats the pants off any other salt or pepper mill you’ve had in your hands because it was designed with intentional purpose from the inside out.Bearings & Burrs: Moulin Salt Mill uses alumina ceramic burrs and zirconia ceramic bearings specifically, because ceramic is rust and corrosion resistant.Interior Chamber & Exterior Finish: 6061 aerospace-grade, anodized aluminum. There is no paint to chip off or leach into the salt to contaminate it. It’s highly scratch resistant and will last a lifetime (or many!) of serious use.Gentle Bottom Ring: There’s a 316L stainless steel retaining ring (the same grade as used on high-end watches) on the bottom so Moulin sits nicely on any table without damaging the surface. It’s insert molded with a Viton ring (like in Formula 1 car engine gaskets) so it will never peel off.Lid: We integrated powerful Neodymium magnets into the lid to hold it on firmly during use, but still allow it to be pulled off when needed for quick refilling.  Despite the science, most “designer” and “pro-grade” salt mills use grinding mechanisms made of steel. And it doesn’t matter if it’s steel, stainless steel or carbon steel—eventually, salt corrodes all 3.This is the main reason we don’t recommend putting salt in the complementary Moulin Pepper Mill—it’s made of stainless steel which is ideal for pepper as it doesn’t corrode like salt.You don’t have to worry about what you put in Moulin. Large-grained salts, either refined from saltwater or mined salts like pink himalayan are fine. We simply recommend not to fill it with wet salt or fibrous spices, like cardamom. Moulin Salt Mill’s chamber fits approximately 90 grams of large-granule salt. This will vary depending on granule size and packing density. And when it’s empty, refilling has never been easier. Just pull and  ""pop"" the top off. Once filled, pop the lid back on and it will gravity-feed back on by floating down on a pocket of air.Plus, corrosion-resistant materials mean this won’t be hard to open for refills, ever.Weber went on to be in charge of implementing the glass screen for the first iPhones, but ultimately left Apple after 13 years to found Weber Workshops (WW). Their first product was a commercial-grade electric coffee grinder, and the team used that same expertise to redefine another frustrating kitchen item: the pepper mill. Moulin Pepper Mills have been such a success that naturally customers are asking for its companion: the Moulin Salt Mill.Weber created the matchless product you see today by rethinking the standard salt mill at Apple-level detail and delivering it at Apple-level quality.Weber created the matchless product you see today by rethinking the standard salt mill at Apple-level detail and delivering it at Apple-level quality.    As a long-time Product Design Engineer at Apple, I learned the difference between products created with purpose and those made for the sake of sales.On top of wasting resources and costing us and the environment more in the long term, these products don’t provide a quality user experience or spark joy in our daily lives.In the case of salt shakers and mills, the cheap ones are full of additives and barely work, while the supposedly high-end ones end up barely lasting longer than the $4 ones.Unlike cell phones, when these items are built with purpose and integrity, they can continue to serve us and improve our quality of life on a daily basis for decades, if not longer. That’s something I get excited about.As anyone with an Apple product can attest, the quality, look, and feel of any Apple product genuinely enhances the experience of using it. The designers and engineers spent innumerable hours sweating the details people didn’t even realize existed, and as products, that puts them on a different plane than the “cheaper” versions available at Walmart.You take quality photos with your iPhone to capture memories that are actually worth looking at later. It all adds up. This is especially true with cooking and eating. Both processes use the senses — taste, smell, touch, sight and even hearing — and the Moulin Mill greatly enhances both the cooking experience and the flavors of eating.This is all to say that we all enjoy high-quality products that deliver. They enhance our quality of life. That’s why Moulin Salt—and all Weber Workshops products for that matter—matter.   Rainfactory is a multiple-award-winning crowdfunding marketing agency that operates as a marketing department for growing brands.

This is done using our own yeast strains which we find in the Danish nature. </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What is bourbon whisky? </h3><p>Bourbon is a type of whisky - broadly characterized by three distinct traits: 1) It must be made of a grain bill that is at least 51% corn, 2) It must be aged on virgin (new) oak casks, and 3) It has to be made within the US. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616668786/uttxirwzo6wxy1dnr020.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We fulfil all the requirements for making bourbon except one: We make it outside the US. Hence, what we produce is a bourbon-style or bourbon-inspired whisky. We do, however, mature our spirit in virgin oak casks and our recipes are in accordance with traditional bourbon recipes. Furthermore, our products are made entirely from Danish ingredients and with our own strains of yeast!</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our still</h3><p>In order to capture and emphasize the taste of our new make we have chosen to use a pot still. The majority of bourbon distilleries use column stills; however, in the quest for complexity in flavor, we went with a pot still which allows us to more precisely manage and adjust the flavor profiles of our whiskies: </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616669142/ekilnisnkfrrpudguc1l.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our products</h3><p>Our output is 100% Danish bourbon-style whisky:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616669197/jlcndjj03mccdugc3bu8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>As indicated in the image above, our first production will include two bourbon-style whiskies: One wheated and one high-rye. You can claim these for yourself by clicking the perks on the right! You will find that our products are competitively priced: Our hope is that this will motivate you to actually drink our whisky instead of letting it gather dust as part of your collection. </p><p>The two whiskies will have different flavors: </p><p>Adding wheat to our whisky gives it a smooth, sweet flavor. We age it in 200 L casks to give it a balanced profile and the final alcohol percent of 40-45% makes this bourbon-style whisky accessible for most.</p><p>Adding rye to our whisky provides a spicier, more peppery flavor, mixed with the intensity of the wood infusion that comes from aging it in a 50 L cask. As we keep this spirit at a cask strength of around 55-60% alcohol, our high-rye bourbon-style whisky will provide a premium taste that we hope even the most experienced taster will enjoy.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The team</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616770852/ryzyzb5ti8bxkphmfwqz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Your contribution</h3><p>It is no secret that our set-up is small. We can’t compete with the big scale productions of many other distilleries, nor is that our ambition. What we wish to do is make innovative, top-quality whisky. And we will not compromise on the quality of our product.</p><p>Your contribution will allow us to perform all of our experiments and to develop our products. Without your contribution we won't be able to unfold the full potential of our distillery.

Our mash bills generally consist of 60-65% corn and just enough malted barley to ensure diastatic acitivty for proper starch conversion. So far, we include either wheat or rye in the grain bill, giving each whisky its own distinct character: </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616669342/lmjeudjxljhjp0e5147z.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Yeast</h3><p>Serving a simple purpose of ethanol formation, yeast is often an overlooked contributor in the art of whisky crafting. Just like, say, the grain of choice, the distillation process, the maturation in casks all confer a significant impact on the properties of the bottled whisky, yeast metabolites formed during fermentation have a big say in the quality of this fine product.</p><p>Because, when yeasts break down sugars to form ethanol and carbondioxide, a plethora of other reactions take place simultaneously. These resulting molecules can impart flavors both beneficial as well as detrimental to the spirit. If the right yeast is used, compounds associated with e.g. fruity and floral flavors will be formed during the fermentation stage. These will then carry over into the distillate.</p><p>This is why we have decided to cultivate our own strains of yeast, which we harvest ourselves from plants we find in nature. After collecting populations of yeasts, we select strains fit for our purpose based on favourable qualities such as fermentation performance and the flavors they form. Having our very own 'house yeasts' is in line with age-old bourbon traditions!</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Still</h3><p>There are, very broadly, two main still types for distilling whisky: Pot stills and Column stills. Both come with a number of subcategories.

This is done using our own yeast strains which we find in the Danish nature. What is bourbon whisky? Bourbon is a type of whisky - broadly characterized by three distinct traits: 1) It must be made of a grain bill that is at least 51% corn, 2) It must be aged on virgin (new) oak casks, and 3) It has to be made within the US. We fulfil all the requirements for making bourbon except one: We make it outside the US. Hence, what we produce is a bourbon-style or bourbon-inspired whisky. We do, however, mature our spirit in virgin oak casks and our recipes are in accordance with traditional bourbon recipes. Furthermore, our products are made entirely from Danish ingredients and with our own strains of yeast! Our stillIn order to capture and emphasize the taste of our new make we have chosen to use a pot still. The majority of bourbon distilleries use column stills; however, in the quest for complexity in flavor, we went with a pot still which allows us to more precisely manage and adjust the flavor profiles of our whiskies: Our productsOur output is 100% Danish bourbon-style whisky:As indicated in the image above, our first production will include two bourbon-style whiskies: One wheated and one high-rye. You can claim these for yourself by clicking the perks on the right! You will find that our products are competitively priced: Our hope is that this will motivate you to actually drink our whisky instead of letting it gather dust as part of your collection. The two whiskies will have different flavors: Adding wheat to our whisky gives it a smooth, sweet flavor. We age it in 200 L casks to give it a balanced profile and the final alcohol percent of 40-45% makes this bourbon-style whisky accessible for most.Adding rye to our whisky provides a spicier, more peppery flavor, mixed with the intensity of the wood infusion that comes from aging it in a 50 L cask. As we keep this spirit at a cask strength of around 55-60% alcohol, our high-rye bourbon-style whisky will provide a premium taste that we hope even the most experienced taster will enjoy. The team Your contributionIt is no secret that our set-up is small. We can’t compete with the big scale productions of many other distilleries, nor is that our ambition. What we wish to do is make innovative, top-quality whisky. And we will not compromise on the quality of our product.Your contribution will allow us to perform all of our experiments and to develop our products. Without your contribution we won't be able to unfold the full potential of our distillery. Help us achieve our whisky dream and cement Denmark as a stronghold on the whisky scene! If you don’t have the financial capacity or motivation to support us economically that’s okay! Luckily, there are other ways through which you can support us. Spread our name on social media and in your personal networks. Chances are you know someone who might be interested in whisky – let them know our name! TimelineThank you so much for reading so far! Now that we've uncovered the basics of our project in general and who we are, we would like to get a little nerdy and elaborate on some of the ways that we want to run our distillery. Mash billsAt Hjortu Destilleri we make bourbon-style whisky using the best Danish corn we can get our hands on - and lots of it. Our mash bills generally consist of 60-65% corn and just enough malted barley to ensure diastatic acitivty for proper starch conversion. So far, we include either wheat or rye in the grain bill, giving each whisky its own distinct character: YeastServing a simple purpose of ethanol formation, yeast is often an overlooked contributor in the art of whisky crafting. Just like, say, the grain of choice, the distillation process, the maturation in casks all confer a significant impact on the properties of the bottled whisky, yeast metabolites formed during fermentation have a big say in the quality of this fine product.Because, when yeasts break down sugars to form ethanol and carbondioxide, a plethora of other reactions take place simultaneously. These resulting molecules can impart flavors both beneficial as well as detrimental to the spirit. If the right yeast is used, compounds associated with e.g. fruity and floral flavors will be formed during the fermentation stage. These will then carry over into the distillate.This is why we have decided to cultivate our own strains of yeast, which we harvest ourselves from plants we find in nature. After collecting populations of yeasts, we select strains fit for our purpose based on favourable qualities such as fermentation performance and the flavors they form. Having our very own 'house yeasts' is in line with age-old bourbon traditions! StillThere are, very broadly, two main still types for distilling whisky: Pot stills and Column stills. Both come with a number of subcategories. In Scotland and Ireland, distilleries traditionally use pot stills (as do most Danish distilleries, by the way) – but in the US, and within the bourbon tradition, column stills are the preferred choice. There is a multitude of theory covering this subject, but the main rule of thumb is this: Pot stills produce more flavor and complexity, whereas column stills provide a cleaner, more refined product.We have ourselves visited a number of distilleries and tasted countless bourbon whiskies. And although it is tradition to make bourbon-style whisky on column stills, we have chosen to use a pot still in order to capture and emphasize the taste as much as possible. This is not totally uncommon: We have visited a number of distilleries in the US, some of which also use pot stills. Inspired by the complexity and taste of their products, we decided to follow in their footsteps. CasksOne of the criteria for making bourbon is that you have to use virgin casks – that is, casks that never have aged another spirit or liquid. Moreover, the cask has to be charred, meaning that the cask is burnt within, which helps unfold and develop certain tastes in the spirit.According to this tradition, we have chosen to use charred virgin oak casks and will like many American distilleries begin with American oak. Later on, we are looking forward to start experimenting with different types of casks as well as finishes.We have chosen to age the two products of our first production on two different sizes of casks. Out wheated bourbon-style whisky is aged on a 200 L cask, because the wheat requires a softer and smoother aging from the tree, since the taste is delicate and mild. Hence, it requires a lesser wood infusion. Our high-rye bourbon-style whisky, however, is aged on a 50 L cask. The rye is very distinct and potent in its taste and is often very hard to drown out – so we believe that it will benefit from a stronger wood infusion. ExperimentsWe wish to be an innovative and experimenting distillery. We want to explore not only taste but also different methods and processes. This is why we also experiment with our own different strains of yeast – we just can’t help but explore the impact that it has on the final product.We will also be experimenting with different grain bills in order to give different flavor profiles to our whiskies.

We hope that in 3 years’ time or so we will continue aging some of our product in different casks. This could be casks that have aged sherry, port wine, rum or other spirits. We will also hope to finish on other types of wood – for example French oak or other wood types outside the oak family. Thank you!Thank you very much for reading our page!

With 6 distinct varieties featuring different combinations of ingredients, you’ll find Yuno serves you in a variety of #lifehappens moments and beyond.What is Biotactical? BioTactical is a term YUNO has coined to define the process of improving human performance at the biological level through botanical ingredients; spices, herbs, roots, fruits, berries, and seeds. By making slight tweaks to your diet, you can heal your gut and other healing benefits will follow suit. YUNO provides NATURAL and PRACTICAL ways to power up, relax, and everything in between. Why science-backed nutrition? With a commitment to the quality of every blend, Yuno is backed by science by harnessing research behind the gut-brain axis. The idea is that when your body is in balance and everything’s running smoothly, you run better as well.These 2-ounce blends are convenient and portable, so you can always have your favorite Yuno on hand. They are also vegan and keto-friendly,  designed to pack the punch you need without any additives, crashes, or ingredients you can’t pronounce.Yuno Energy | If you’ve got a particularly busy day ahead and need sustained energy that won’t make you crash, Yuno Energy is your go-to. This spicy yet sweet citrus and pepper blend works by giving your metabolism a boost, helping your body absorb and process nutrients to promote both mental and physical alertness. You’ll move right through that midday slump and feel light on your feet as you tackle all the challenges of your day. Yuno Energy is great when taken in place of your normal espresso shot.Yuno Focus | When you have deadlines to hit but your mind won’t stop wandering, turn to Yuno Focus. By focusing on calming your mind, increasing your concentration and refreshing your eyesight as you stare at that screen, Yuno Focus helps you feel more attentive, alert, and able to tackle your task head-on. Unlike other fleeting focus drinks you may have tried, this fruity and refreshing blend gives you a sustained focus to channel throughout the day. Yuno Focus tastes great when made into a latte by adding a bit of milk.Yuno Memory | If your brain is about to get a serious workout, give it the boost it needs with Yuno Memory. Formulated to help clear up a foggy brain and improve your mental acuity, you’ll want Yuno Memory by your side to enhance critical and creative thinking. This unique umami flavor will be your new favorite “brain food”, working particularly great when added to your favorite smoothie.Yuno Uplift | For those searching for that little extra help to get through a stressful situation either socially or professionally, Yuno Uplift gives you the confidence you need to conquer anything. Yuno Uplift works by making you feel more relaxed and therefore, better able to be your wonderful self. Bold and full-bodied, Yuno Uplift is the perfect complement to your favorite glass of red.Yuno Zen | If you have trouble unwinding or need to snap out of your funk, Yuno Zen is here to help. Whether it’s relaxing after a particularly stressful day or simply giving yourself a natural pick-me-up, Yuno Zen is made to make you feel warm and cozy inside. And once you’re feeling like that on the inside, you’ll be able to project that on the outside. We love Yuno Zen as the metaphorical cherry on top of your favorite ice cream sundae.Yuno Dream | When all you need is just a good night’s sleep, turn to Yuno Dream to start counting more restful, nourishing Zzzs. Its drowsy experience soothes you into a natural state of relaxation, so your body can go into “repair” mode. This woodsy and sleepy blend ensures you will wake up feeling more naturally rested than ever. Simply warm it up with your choice of nighttime beverage and start counting sheep. See how Yuno stacks up against your favorite beverages.You might not think about your gut all that often. But it’s actually key to maintaining homeostasis in the body. After all, there’s a reason mom told you to “trust your gut”. That’s how important it is.And this is not just about smoother trips to the bathroom. In fact, scientific studies show that the gut-brain axis is one of the most critical aspects of performance. If your gut-brain axis is out of whack, so are you. That’s why all Yuno blends are chosen ingredients shown to improve gut-brain communication. And with carefully-selected ingredients that naturally provide certain benefits like immunity, energy, and relaxation, each Yuno blend becomes a powerful little pack that makes you more YOU. No additives. No crash. No bullsh*t mystery ingredients. The gut-brain axis is key to how active, happy, focused or relaxed you feel (or don’t feel). But why?Well as it turns out, the gut holds the key to all those little neurotransmitters that are running around inside our bodies all the time. These are the little hits of serotonin and dopamine that the body serves up to make us happy, productive, and in control. Yuno works from the inside out, using the gut as a superhighway to your brain and delivering these neurotransmitters more directly. By targeting the gut in this way, we activate your body using an all-natural approach much different from using additives like caffeine. It’s all about optimizing the best you - straight from your gut to your brain.At Yuno, we care deeply about the quality of our products - and that includes how they get made. We have adopted a carefully-considered zero waste, sustainable production process. Alongside our partner Grounded-Upcycling, we ensure that any residue created in the Yuno production process is turned into nutrient-rich food used to grow mushrooms. And when you’re done with your Yuno pack, you don’t have to worry about recycling it on your own because every delivery box will be able to be sent to and recycled by our partners at Terracycle at no additional cost to you. These efforts result in us being 12X more sustainable than a single can of soda. So you can feel great drinking Yuno and feel great about your low-impact on the Earth.We founded Yuno because we believe in the power of nature. For us, it was important that we created a product that aligned with our values of transparency and effectiveness. The “natural” food market is cluttered with so many products making so many claims that it’s hard to know what you can trust.Our company, Food to Heal, was founded on these principles. We make natural ingredients the heroes of our products, focusing on how unique product and flavor combinations together to achieve high-performance results.With a background in food research, we had science on our side from the beginning. And that commitment to science carries through in everything we do. Our focus on the relationship between the brain and the gut enables us to provide a product that is grounded in nature but approached in an entirely new way.We can’t wait to have you join the Yuno family.Please check out the FAQ section available within Indiegogo, our website at www.yuno.nyc for more information, or drop us a line at hello@yuno.nyc if you have any additional questions!",41.0,5,"1 Campaign

Add up to 26 grams of coffee,  hot water, wait, and press. Oomph™ 2.0 will take care of the rest - coffee perfection! Enjoy the coffee on its own or add milk and sugar.  The video animation above shows internally how the Oomph™ 2.0 brews. Oomph™ 2.0 locks in the flavour and aromas after the brew. Simultaneously, the brewed coffee is separated from the grounds preventing bitterness.   As you can see, Oomph™ has been featured in some popular publications who all agree with just how good the coffee is from the Oomph. Along with this Oomph™ has featured on Radio shows, Podcasts and even BBC's Dragons Den, securing an investment from one of the Dragons.   Being an amazing coffee maker is not where it ends... Once brewed, Oomph™ 2.0 locks securely to become a fully watertight, insulated travel cup.        Oomph™ 2.0 is made for more than just the kitchen and is the ultimate 2 in 1 coffee maker and travel cup:  Oomph™ 2.0 makes amazing black coffee that can be taken anywhere! The easy-press piston design seals in the flavour after brewing until you are ready to drink. Completely self-contained within a watertight, compact travel cup, Oomph™ 2.0 will surpass your go-to kitchen coffee maker and enjoyed on-the-go.  Oomphs totally watertight design means no problems with accidental spills or carrying it around and that just brewed taste will be kept fresh and hot for up to an hour!  Oomph™ 2.0 may be packed full of coffee wizardry but still only takes up the same space as many popular travel cups.  Oomph™ 2.0 will fit in 96% of car cup holders and even if you are in the unlucky 4% it's watertight so can fit anywhere else.  Our case locking design is inspired by the Japanese methodology of Poka-Yoke. The casing now glides into the lock from any position so you simply can't get it wrong! With a reassuring CLICK, all that delicate aroma and fresh coffee taste are sealed in! [POKA-YOKE is a Japanese term which means “mistake-proofing”]  Safe and tough, Oomph™ 2.0 is made from the best materials available for the job. Never clouding, keeping its style and visually striking appearance use after use.  Pumping the Oomph™ 2.0 piston allows you to flush clean water back and forth through the reusable ultra-fine filter.  Watch as clogged coffee particles are blasted clear of the filter.  Just rinse out and you're ready to go.   Thanks to the narrowing chamber with a domed filter the used and compressed coffee cake just drops out of Oomph™ 2.0.   Oomph™ 2.0 can brew hot, cold and even tea! Our improved mechanism allows for a softer press, however producing a higher pressure!    Oomph 2.0's non-drip designed spout means sharing Oomph with anyone is quick, easy and spill-free!   With all of the coffee makers on the market, many people ask how is Oomph™ 2.0 different, and better than other coffee makers?

<h3>Hello! </h3>
<p>My name is Adrian and I have been roasting beans at home for myself for about 8 years or so and have dreamed of one day starting my own roasting business. Prior to that I was a barista for a number of years. As I've honed my roasting skills I have been encouraged by many to take the leap and be able to sell beans on a larger scale. </p>
<p>In order to do that, I need to be trained on how to use a machine that roasts around 18 pounds of beans at a time compared to my home roaster that can roast 4 ounces at a time. Instead of 1 or 2 pound bags of green coffee beans I will need to buy 65 pound bags of beans! </p>
<p>Once beans are roasted I will sell them via a website (where single bags and subscriptions will be available), as well as face to face (farmer's markets, etc.). My vision is to try to offer regular varietals as well limited seasonal roasts. <br/><br/>I have already taken steps to start this venture. The business is registered, I have a domain and am working on a website, I have storage for roasted beans, bags, and even a logo stamp. This campaign will help with the final push to start buying beans, get the training, and purchase other needed gear and materials. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Story Behind The Name </h3>
<p>Ace Run Roasting is the name. I like to play disc golf and compete in tournaments when I can. In disc golf (and regular golf) when you are trying to make a hole in one, it's called an ace run. When I was a child my nickname was Ace, and I used to run track. That's the story.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Is Needed</h3>
<p>The training will be done at the place where I've been buying my personal green beans from: Mr. Green Beans in Portland, OR. The training will be in 3 hour long sessions and will cost <strong>$300</strong>. After the training I will be able to rent their machine for <strong>$35/hr</strong>. I should be able to do 3 roasts per hour.<br/><br/>I have to go through another source for the larger amounts of green beans. On average a 65 pound bag or box of green beans will cost around <strong>$200 each</strong>. I will need at least 3-4 boxes to get through the training.<br/><br/>I will need a machine that seals the bags in order to keep the coffee fresh.

<p>People like stickers and can be great promotional items and gifts. Those and business cards will cost me about <strong>$150</strong></p>
<p>I really feel that that is about all I really need at the bare minimum to get started and have confidence that once people can taste what I have to offer that I will be able to maintain and slowly scale up from there. All in all everything listed above comes up to <strong>$1440</strong>. This platform holds money in case people change their minds and want a refund and it also takes a percentage off the top.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have confidence that I have good skills when it comes to roasting. I am admittedly nervous to learn to roast so much at a time even though the folks doing the training say that it's basically the same except for different buttons and knobs and being able to hook up a laptop to it and see what's going on! Knowing that they will be there guiding me helps me take deep breathes.

Whether the atmosphere was unwelcoming, the prices were inaccessible, or the menu just wasn't your cup of tea, we know how that feels, and we want to make a space for you. </p><p><strong>Hi, we’re Jevonna and Kels, and we’re opening The Galaxy Coffee: a coffee truck for everyone!</strong></p><p>As baristas and former coffee shop managers, we have a lot of pride in the coffee we serve. We also have pride in who we are — a small, local, queer and trans-owned worker cooperative with a commitment to building community and paying it forward. </p><p><strong>Our vision is to create a space where community gathers</strong> — people of all genders and generations — where you don't feel out of place. It's the reason we named ourselves after an idea in the queer community that gender is more than a binary, more than a spectrum, and more like a whole galaxy of possibilities. It's why we have our Community Jar for anyone to pay it forward when they can, and use when they need. It's also why, eventually, we want to open a brick-and-mortar coffee shop for everyone to enjoy each other's company as much as they enjoy our lattes and baked goods. H<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">opefully with your help, we can make this happen!</span></p><p> </p><h2>Our Goals</h2><ul>
<li>
<strong>Inclusivity </strong>— we'll always be queer and trans inclusive, and our menu will include vegan, gluten-free, and sugar-free options, all for no extra charge.</li>
<li>
<strong>Accessibility</strong> — we'll have accessible locations, braille and large-print menus, and with our Community Jar we can provide free food and drink options to customers who need it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Transparency</strong> — we work with queer and/or locally owned businesses at every possible opportunity to source our products.</li>
<li>
<strong>Empowerment</strong> — we are a worker cooperative, which means we are completely worker-owned.</li>
<li>
<strong>Employment</strong> — we're prioritizing BIPOC, queer, trans, and disabled applicants of all generations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Safety</strong> — we're requiring masks and social distancing, and we’re committed to creating a safe, healthy, and welcoming environment for our team and customers. </li>
</ul><p> </p><h2>Why We Need Your Help</h2><ul>
<li>
<strong>Food truck ($25,000 - $35,000)</strong> — we’re prioritizing looking at used food trucks from other local businesses.</li>
<li>
<strong>Brewing equipment ($12,000)</strong> — we need two espresso machines, scales, grinders, a fridge, and an oven.</li>
<li>
<strong>Product ($3,000 to start)</strong> — we’ll need to buy coffee beans, tea, dairy and non-dairy milks, sweeteners and syrups, and food and bakery items.</li>
<li>
<strong>Licensing and Legal Fees ($2,500)</strong> — we need inspections, certifications, and all our ducks in a row before we can officially open our windows!</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><strong>All together, we're looking at $42,500 - $52,500 to start.</strong> With the help of loans and savings, we can get our coffee truck up and running if we make it to our $40,000 Indiegogo campaign goal, which would be incredible! And if the stars align and we're lucky enough to go past that, we can add even more vegan, gluten-free, and low carb food items to our menu, and we can go to more places in Columbus and see more of you!</p><p> </p><h2>Our Perks</h2><p>We have so many perks!

Whether the atmosphere was unwelcoming, the prices were inaccessible, or the menu just wasn't your cup of tea, we know how that feels, and we want to make a space for you. Hi, we’re Jevonna and Kels, and we’re opening The Galaxy Coffee: a coffee truck for everyone!As baristas and former coffee shop managers, we have a lot of pride in the coffee we serve. We also have pride in who we are — a small, local, queer and trans-owned worker cooperative with a commitment to building community and paying it forward. Our vision is to create a space where community gathers — people of all genders and generations — where you don't feel out of place. It's the reason we named ourselves after an idea in the queer community that gender is more than a binary, more than a spectrum, and more like a whole galaxy of possibilities. It's why we have our Community Jar for anyone to pay it forward when they can, and use when they need. It's also why, eventually, we want to open a brick-and-mortar coffee shop for everyone to enjoy each other's company as much as they enjoy our lattes and baked goods. Hopefully with your help, we can make this happen! Our Goals

Inclusivity — we'll always be queer and trans inclusive, and our menu will include vegan, gluten-free, and sugar-free options, all for no extra charge.

Accessibility — we'll have accessible locations, braille and large-print menus, and with our Community Jar we can provide free food and drink options to customers who need it.

Transparency — we work with queer and/or locally owned businesses at every possible opportunity to source our products.

Empowerment — we are a worker cooperative, which means we are completely worker-owned.

Employment — we're prioritizing BIPOC, queer, trans, and disabled applicants of all generations.

Safety — we're requiring masks and social distancing, and we’re committed to creating a safe, healthy, and welcoming environment for our team and customers. 
 Why We Need Your Help

Food truck ($25,000 - $35,000) — we’re prioritizing looking at used food trucks from other local businesses.

Brewing equipment ($12,000) — we need two espresso machines, scales, grinders, a fridge, and an oven.

Product ($3,000 to start) — we’ll need to buy coffee beans, tea, dairy and non-dairy milks, sweeteners and syrups, and food and bakery items.

Licensing and Legal Fees ($2,500) — we need inspections, certifications, and all our ducks in a row before we can officially open our windows!
 All together, we're looking at $42,500 - $52,500 to start. With the help of loans and savings, we can get our coffee truck up and running if we make it to our $40,000 Indiegogo campaign goal, which would be incredible! And if the stars align and we're lucky enough to go past that, we can add even more vegan, gluten-free, and low carb food items to our menu, and we can go to more places in Columbus and see more of you! Our PerksWe have so many perks! From coffee mugs and tumblers to t-shirts and masks, stickers and pins, as well as VIP beverage discounts and personalized thank you cards — we want you to find that perfect fit for your donation!Our Community Jar is also included in our perks!

Companies have released a plethora of natural products in hopes to reduce the amount of single-use items produced and used. Wax wraps, stainless steel cutlery, reusable food containers, and compostable trash bags are just a few examples of products that aim to reduce our carbon footprint. However, carrying a number of these products can become cumbersome and cluttered, especially when traveling or going out for the day.Keep your hands and bags clutter-free with this tumbler and its hidden stainless steel cutlery.      Hi, we’re Ryan and Aaron, long-time friends and business partners!We both grew up in the surfing and wakeboard industry, so living a sustainable lifestyle has been a very integral part of our lives. With 15 years as partners in the marketing industry, creating a product of our own was always in the back of our minds. We were brainstorming business ideas and knew that we wanted to create something eco-friendly, which is when the idea for NOSU was born– a reusable tumbler with stainless steel cutlery stored inside. We created something that we were passionate about and are excited to launch a product that will drastically improve sustainability in people’s everyday lives. Simply put, we’re determined to make it effortless for people to be more sustainable while on the go.

<p>You love your family!  You want to keep them safe!  You want to celebrate life and life’s milestones.  The Wishmaker brings additional joy and supreme safety to the act of blowing out candles on your and your loved one’s cake.</p>
<p>With its sleek design, soft whirring sound, ease of use and ability to block 96.79% of harmful germs, bacteria and virus with an FDA approved medical grade filter, the Wishmaker is a must for every occasion that entails blowing out candles.</p>
<p>Simply put it to your lips and blow after you make your wish.</p>
<p>The Wishmaker will give a little push to your dreams and keep everybody safe at the same time.  Afterall, we want to keep everyone healthy and safe; which in itself is a wish come true.</p>
<p>I conceived of the Wishmaker more than 30 years ago by addressing the dirty little secret that we all keep.  Blowing out candles on a cake is GROSS!  I was very sensitive to the design so as not to bring attention to that fact.  Back then, no one wanted to admit the issue.  So we turned a collective blind eye.  I wanted to enhance the wishmaking experience.  Make it more fun and enjoyable and quietly bring safety and efficacy to protecting family, friends and guests.</p>
<p>Well...everybody thought I was a little nuts.  Then 15 years ago I created the new prototype through thorough engineering.  And guess what?  Everybody still thought I was nuts.</p>
<p>Soooo...flash forward to 2020.  I’m not so nuts anymore.I am a father to two adult, and thankfully healthy, daughters.  As a parent, I have always wanted to keep them safe.  And to that extent, my drive has always been to keep as many family's loved ones healthy and safe as well.  I am extremely proud of the team that has helped me refine the Wishmaker to make it affordable, effective and fun.</p>
<p>I named it the Wishmaker and never moved away from that  because I believe that the experience of using the Wishmaker would give a little psychological punctuation to the act of closing your eyes, making your wish, and blowing out your candles.</p>

<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>There are always risks involved in building a business and introducing a new product to the market. The good news is that I have vast experience building successful businesses. That being said, this is the first time I am launching a consumer product and selling directly. I have mitigated much of this by assembling a team of professionals across the spectrum (logistics coordinator, web design, social media organizations, handles on all topical social media platforms, etc..). One risk out of everyone's control at the moment is the cost of raw materials and shipping. If they continue to soar it will be reflected in the cost of the item to the consumer which may impact the total potential purchasers. However, everyone in the world has a birthday from 1-100. So technically there is no specific audience that we would be losing out on. With 350 million people in the US alone, it is a very broad base to draw from.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are seeking to raise $65,000 to finish production and market properly.  I have personally spent more than $35,000 over the past years creating the vision and prototype in addition to setting up a social marketing campaign.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are award-winning creators of Vegan and Gluten-free cakes.  We started at a market stall in London's Berwick Street and were discovered by the buyers at Wholefoods.  We now have a production unit where we lovingly hand make brownies, cakes, cookies and pies.  Plant-based and gluten-free, we use all natural ingredients: our treats are ""clean label"".  We have won 4 Great Taste Awards so far.</p>
<p>We have just put the finishing touches on our best creation to date: Vegan and Gluten-free stollen in two flavours which will be packaged in a gift tin for the Holiday Season.  Cranberry, Pistachio &amp; Orange or Chocolate Hazelnut, both with handmade marzipan.</p>
<p>We know this will be an enormous ""hit"" for us if we are able to properly market it.  It will enable us to grow the business, and make our delicious and great quality ""free from"" products available to a wider consumer base.</p>

We are award-winning creators of Vegan and Gluten-free cakes.  We started at a market stall in London's Berwick Street and were discovered by the buyers at Wholefoods.  We now have a production unit where we lovingly hand make brownies, cakes, cookies and pies.  Plant-based and gluten-free, we use all natural ingredients: our treats are ""clean label"".  We have won 4 Great Taste Awards so far.
We have just put the finishing touches on our best creation to date: Vegan and Gluten-free stollen in two flavours which will be packaged in a gift tin for the Holiday Season.  Cranberry, Pistachio & Orange or Chocolate Hazelnut, both with handmade marzipan.
We know this will be an enormous ""hit"" for us if we are able to properly market it.  It will enable us to grow the business, and make our delicious and great quality ""free from"" products available to a wider consumer base.

<p><strong>Healthy</strong>, <strong>flavorful</strong>, great with any meal, <strong>versatile flavor enhancement</strong>, gives <strong>brightness</strong> and that ""extra something"" to almost any meal, naturally fermented, vegan, gluten free, and <strong>no artificial ingredients</strong>. Acid is something <i>all</i> great chefs think about when they cook, so you should too.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Less Pretentious</strong></h3>
<p>I worked in restaurants for almost 20 years, and was fortunate enough to work in some very good ones in New York City where I learned about some of the most excellent food and wine in the world. I also came to despise the pretentiousness that came along with it. We all have taste buds, and you don't need PhD-level knowledge to enjoy great food and wine. Everyone eats every day. Your taste buds know what's good.</p>
<p>I quit drinking in 2016 and began using wine that was going to be thrown away (I used to throw it away into my belly) to make vinegar as a hobby. After four years of experimentation and working on my craft I decided to start a company to make flavorful, healthy, interesting, and unpretentious vinegars that are crafted for cooking and versatility. </p>
<p>I make vinegars that are easy to use and easy to appreciate. The best way to tie together a meal of random ingredients in the fridge instead of going to the store or ordering delivery.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why I'm asking you for help</strong></h3>
<p>I cannot sell vinegar from my home to you. It needs to be made in a commercial kitchen using food grade equipment, and it takes weeks or sometimes months to complete a batch, and even longer if I barrel age, but it's worth it.</p>
<p>I'm trying now to get the space to bring three new flavors into the world.  All three are vegan products, but taste great with meat, fish, and poultry as well.</p>
<p><strong>Madeira, Sichuan, Calendula </strong></p>
<p>Madeira is sweet wine that's been heated and cooled by the sun over and over until it gets it's distinct baked flavor. Combine that with the zip of acid, the floral, citrusy Sichuan peppercorn with it's distinct ""zap,"" and Calendula, a flavor cousin to saffron, and you have a great alternative to Balsamic, but less sweet.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Atlantic Kelp, Rice Wine, Bay Leaf</strong></p>
<p>Sustainable, organic sugar kelp with rice wine and fresh bay leaf are the perfect balance of savory, sweet, sour, and earthy to bring dishes to life with rice, vegetables, soup, poultry, beans, and especially fish.</p>
<p><strong>Barrel-Aged Dulse</strong></p>
<p>Dulse (sustainably harvested and organic) is sometimes substituted for bacon or mushrooms, but the reality is that this seaweed is quite delicious for what it is and doesn't need to be anything it isn't. I use methods I learned from herbal medicine to make a very strong Dulse broth which I then ferment and age in peated oak barrels (like Scotch barrels.) The saline smokiness is sublime.</p>
<p><strong>More Flavors</strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of great flavors that will happen in the future. Your support now means that they'll be available for sale, and not just for dinner at my place. Watermelon-roasted-for-a-month vinegar? Sugar Pumpkin Amizake vinegar? Exotic wine vinegar? If this Indiegogo blows up it'll be a reality.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Fermentation Collective (not empire)</strong></h3>
<p>I want the world to ferment more to make food more delicious, but also because fermentation is an easy, healthy way to reduce waste so we can be more sustainable human beings. Your support of a small company will also mean that others will see and follow. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi my name is Kennedy L. Morrow Sr and I’m a retired U.S. Army soldier of 25years that happens to love traveling and eating bbq, grilled or smoked turkey leg.

Short Summary

Hi my name is Kennedy L. Morrow Sr and I’m a retired U.S. Army soldier of 25years that happens to love traveling and eating bbq, grilled or smoked turkey leg. Because of this love and observation or problems encountered while eating them, I’ve invented and patented the “Smoked Turkey Leg Case” which will sanitize and revolutionize the way we eat turkey legs.
Since I have experienced receiving a turkey leg that was too hot to hold, saw some of the tender meat drop off the bone then on the ground; tried to eat the turkey leg without all the juice or grease getting all over me;  tried to keep the turkey leg safe and free of air born contaminants; having been unable to eat the whole thing in one setting and wishing I had the ability to store the rest to eat later; I wanted to make sure consumers have a better, safe & sanitize way to eat and store smoked turkey legs.
By helping me with this campaign and making my “Smoked Turkey Leg Case” available to consumers, we can guarantee that the problems typically encountered while eating hot juicy x-large bar-be-que, grilled or smoked turkey legs are solved.

 

What We Need & What You Get

Although I have spent the last seven years personally financing the efforts to design, prototype, test and patent my “Smoked Turkey Leg Case” invention, I will need an estimated $325,000.00 to acquire the injection molds, production contract(s), produce the initial inventory, store it, cover all overhead and operating expense, marketing and selling the product to my waiting and new customers. 
As a start-up, I plan to offer the following perks based on my backers contributions: Personalized Smoked Turkey Leg cases (STLCs) from the initial production run, T-shirts w logo, Ball caps w logo, key chains w logo, printed paper and magnet stickers, etc,..
All funding will go towards moving my company into the production, marketing & sales phase as listed above should we reach our funding goals or not.  


The Impact

This project will generate a product that will be used by turkey leg consumers to address the unpleasant issues encountered while eating them. The product will mainly be used to eat, protect, and store turkey legs in. It will also eliminate wasted turkey leg meat, which saves the consumer money and reduce the normal trash generated the current way they are consumed as it’s washable and reusable. The product will also reduce the chances of spreading germs via hands not touching the turkey leg, or other air transported contaminants or viruses from getting on the meat as the case is closed when the smoked turkey leg is not being eaten.

Since this is the only product of it's kind, there is currently no competition out there. However, I have already taken the initiative to the acquire and publish the respective national and international patents & trademark to protect the product and market it will create to further minimize any risk.
Also my 25years of leadership and management background in the US military, the 14 years of experience I have acquired from managing people and supporting various fortune 500 company’s information systems, my circle of friends that are certified chefs, my ability to attract and or recruit other talented people in the food and beverage industry and my vast knowledge with turkey legs makes me very capable of logically addressing and resolving any hurdles that I may encounter.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>Espresso is the start of many great coffees</div>
<p>That's why we believe in the power of really good espresso. We also believe that the coffee market can - and must - be more sustainable and fairer. </p>
<p>Of course, that starts with the device. Superkop originated from the vision that espresso machines should last longer. That means: no electrical components and only the very best materials. Superkop lasts a lifetime, or even several generations. We do it slightly different. But the essence is that with your Superkop you will be able to make superb espresso.</p>

<p>We are Geert and Sabine, the innovators of Superkop.  </p>
<p>Eight years ago, after another expensive service of our espresso machine, we decided to find a way to make electricity redundant and create a robust but straightforward espresso tool.  Also we didn't like the fact that it takes so long to warm up the machine, and why was that anyway ? We found out it was only because of two things:  1. Heating up the water, and 2. Achieving the right pressure: 9 bar for a good espresso.  Hot water is commodity.  We all make tea, have a hot water tap, or we have another way to get water at the right temperature. </p>
<p>The challenge was achieving the 9 bars of pressure required for an ideal espresso. We had to find a way to make it easy to do manually.  Then we would be able to make a real espresso without any electricity. After many years of trial and error we have now found the solution! Many testers are already enjoying Superkop. We are proud to tell that even one of the best-known baristas was impressed.</p>
<p><strong>How did we get here</strong></p>
<p>Once we got the idea and decided to find a solution we first studied everything that you possibly can learn about the ideal espresso.  You need 9 to 10 bars, water of 92-96 degrees Celcius, 7 grams ground beans for 30 ml espresso.</p>
<p>There were no secrets left after reading many books and online studies. We tried all products that had manual power instead of electricity. But nothing came close to our ideal espresso maker.</p>
<p>To make it a lively project we thought about the look and feel, and created a mood-board for that.</p>

<h3>How's JOEPRESSO™ different from AeroPress®? </h3>
<p>An espresso machine and JOEPRESSO™ forces hot water through a layer of coffee grinds stripping them of dissolvable solids and oils in a method called pressurized percolation. In contrast, in an immersion brewer such as the AeroPress® you mix the coffee with water in the chamber and let it steep before pressing the coffee out through a paper filter.</p>
<p>JOEPRESSO™ uses a classic stainless steel pressurized filter basket found on many espresso machines to transform the AeroPress® from an immersion brewer to a percolation brewer. Using the same coffee to water ratios we have found that JOEPRESSO™ produces a richer espresso with higher levels of TDS - Total Dissolved Solids. JOEPRESSO™ also produces crema, which is a sign of a good fresh espresso.</p>
<h3>How Is JOEPRESSO™ different from a Moka Pot?</h3>
<p>Like a Moka Pot, Joepresso forces hot water through a layer of coffee grinds. However, Joepresso offers much more control. As you can adjust the coffee volume, water volume, the water temperature and the rate at which the water is forced through the coffee grinds.

<h3>Why Indiegogo</h3>
<p>We are happy to have reached our target for producing the JOEPRESSO™ and as of now, we've started shipping the rewards.

How to Use Joepresso™

Experiments

 

How's JOEPRESSO™ different from AeroPress®? 
An espresso machine and JOEPRESSO™ forces hot water through a layer of coffee grinds stripping them of dissolvable solids and oils in a method called pressurized percolation. In contrast, in an immersion brewer such as the AeroPress® you mix the coffee with water in the chamber and let it steep before pressing the coffee out through a paper filter.
JOEPRESSO™ uses a classic stainless steel pressurized filter basket found on many espresso machines to transform the AeroPress® from an immersion brewer to a percolation brewer. Using the same coffee to water ratios we have found that JOEPRESSO™ produces a richer espresso with higher levels of TDS - Total Dissolved Solids. JOEPRESSO™ also produces crema, which is a sign of a good fresh espresso.
How Is JOEPRESSO™ different from a Moka Pot?
Like a Moka Pot, Joepresso forces hot water through a layer of coffee grinds. However, Joepresso offers much more control. As you can adjust the coffee volume, water volume, the water temperature and the rate at which the water is forced through the coffee grinds. Generally, you will be able to make a faster espresso with a JOEPRESSO™ and therefore avoid the drink becoming over-extracted and bitter.
Use it for Espresso, Americano, Cappuccino, Latte and More
When you need a coffee that will cut through the milk, JOEPRESSO™ is a simple solution that works. Not only will you be able to make great tasting espresso, but all other espresso-based drinks. Though it takes a bit of effort, you can froth milk using the JOEPRESSO™.

We are Mauricio and Andres, two young scientists and the best of friends. Like many of you, we’ve passionately searched for the balance between a savory diet and one that is optimal for you. After countless hours combing through the literature and talking to experts in the field, it became clear that a low-carb, and especially a Ketogenic diet can work wonders for one’s well-being. Following our own personal struggles adhering to the diet, we decided to create Keto Kind, a plant-based, ready-to-drink ketogenic shake meeting the highest of standards, to help us, and you along the way. Let's break it downMade from organic ingredients: Keto Kind is designed to help you reach and maintain a state of ketosis. We have created this product to make keto accessible and easy to adhere to.  Keto Kind's calories come mostly from fats and there is no need for iffy net carb calculations. The shakes have just 3g total carbs and are full of healthy monounsaturated fats, with a spoonful of MCT's to provide lasting energy.To us, Keto Kind tastes best cold (and after it is appropriately shaked), but don't only take it from us. Let's see what early adopters are saying:  Making keto simpleWe’ve probably all heard that eating sugar or processed foods is not ideal. And while that is most likely true, actually doing so, is not easy (just ask us about it). Saying “no” to a melted-cheese, crunchy pizza or a freshly baked brownie requires everything we’ve got.  When you add the constraints of a busy schedule, or yearnings after a long day, we tend to go for what’s convenient and will satisfy our cravings, which is not always the healthy choice.At the same time, when we take a few too many of these decisions and compound them over time, our bodies tend to wear down and that can lead to chronic conditions. As Travis Christofferson, author of ""Ketones, the Fourth Fuel"" and one of our scientific advisors describes:(If you want to dive deeper and watch Travis’ full 4-min explanatory video, you can click on this link) Realizing how widespread this problem is, it was clear that a product that was accessible and well-formulated had to be created.

Put a chef in your pocket, with Figo, vacuum seal, cool, and cook food automatically with your phone. Figo not only enhances the quality of your meal but also elevates your health! See how easy Figo makes cooking   Get better results with Figo cooking Steak cooked with Figo is perfect, from edge-to-edge with a tasty light crust. Unlike traditional cooking methods, shown on the left, sous vide cooking yields larger & flavorful results as meat isn’t dried out. Perfectly cooked eggs are a challenge for chefs at any level. Figo allows you to control exactly how the eggs turn out. Traditional cooking tends to create overcooked edges.  Like steaks, salmon made with Figo is perfectly cooked from edge-to-edge, whereas traditional pan-searing or oven methods tend to shrink the meat and overcook the edge.  Figo in the newsFlawless Meals in 3 Easy Steps

 
Figo makes cooking easyOnce limited to the pros, sous vide cooking gets you consistent and tasty results every time, even if you've never cooked before.Sous vide is an easy, hands-free way to cook great food that will wow your guests. It's all about bringing your food to an exact temperature and holding it until you get a perfect result. Sous vide style cooking means:

Healthier and Tastier Cooking  — Use fewer oils by letting food cook in its juices and retain more nutrients with low-temperature cooking.

Consistent Results — Food is always cooked to a precise temperature for a specific amount of time that can be easily repeated.

Never Overcook Again — By slowly reaching the temperatures you set, your food won’t ever overcook. 

Easy Cleanup — Simply wash your reusable bag and jars or recycle plastic bags after cooking. 

Practical Meal Prep — Save time by leaving food cooking for hours, and use tougher cuts of meat that will be left incredibly tender.
 Figo perfects the sous vide experience More than a precision cooker, Figo is built to save time in the kitchen, ensuring your food is ready when you schedule it.Even if you're starting in the kitchen or have years of experience, Figo empowers you to become a better cook:

Hands-Free Cooking — Whether you’re busy with work or entertaining guests, Figo lets you focus on the other busy parts of life. 

Vacuum Sealer Attachment — Seal your food with your favorite herbs and spices while also helping to retain nutrients and cook food in its natural juices for better results. 

Perfect, Consistent Results — Eliminate the margin of error and cook your meals like a pro every time with precise temperature control.

Keeps Food Fresh — Figo safely chills the main compartment before and after cooking down to FDA Recommended 37° F with our patented Dry Sous Vide System. 

App-Assisted Perfection — Cook from 20+ chef-made recipes or choose your adventure with temperature control and cook times.

Cook From Anywhere — Figo connects to the world via WiFi, allowing you to control your meals and schedule no matter where you are.

No More Mush — Removes water from the main compartment after cooking, so food isn’t crushed by pressure resulting in flakier salmon, tender meats, and crisp vegetables.

   PRECISELY COOKEDTO PERFECTION Restaurant quality results, every timeGet consistent in the kitchen. Don’t worry about overcooking or watching an open flame - Figo handles the rest.Sous vide is used by many high-end restaurants and even in chain establishments to ensure consistent results. With Figo, cook with the same level of precision while also exploring new flavor combinations or recipes to get:
Consistent results when you cook means less anxiety about over/undercooking.
Healthier dishes that use few fats and oils while keeping natural moisture.
More nutrients that don't get burned away from hot temperatures.
 Vacuum sealer attachmentFigo is the only sous vide machine with the extra convenience of having a vacuum sealer directly on the device.Take even less time preparing your meals with our vacuum sealer attachment available on the Figo Deluxe model, which works with popular vacuum seal bag varieties so that you don’t have to spend extra money on separate parts or machines. Flavors and moisture are locked in making it easy to get delicious and consistent results without heavy seasoning. Combined with precise temperature control, your food will have a higher yield (less food wasted), better texture, and more tender over traditional methods.Add your ingredients to the bag and start the pump using the Figo app.  Spend less time in the kitchen Save up to 6 hours each week when you cook with Figo, saving you time from dirty dishes and messy prep work.Figo makes mealtime practical. Load and vacuum seal your food in as little as 30 seconds. Our Dry Sous Vide system keeps food chilled until it's time to cook. Leave frozen and prepared dishes inside Figo for when you're on the go. With a large 1.25-gallon storage tank, fit up to 4 servings.  Precise temperature control Sous vide relies on keeping a consistent temperature to cook food perfectly. Figo’s sensors maintain that accuracy.Cook to a +/- 1° temperature difference up 190° F for a perfect medium-rare steak, flaky salmon, or crisp vegetables that are still full of nutrients. Figo's high-quality temperature sensors to regulate the heat within the main cooking compartment. The propeller circulator keeps water moving around so that the temperature is the same everywhere.The app makes it easy to set a custom temperature cook while giving you accurate times when your meal will be ready based on weight and ingredients. Safely store food until cooking Like a small fridge, Figo’s Dry Sous Vide System helps keep food chilled to temperatures as low as 37° F.Vacuum sealing is not enough to stop foodborne illness! They can develop with foods left at room temperature or if food isn't cooled down quickly. With our Dry Sous Vide System, Figo safely cools your food down, surpassing FDA guidelines (below 40° F within 2 hours).  As a bonus, it's kept cold in a dry environment that saves food texture from water pressure.    FIGO'S REVOLUTIONARYDRY SOUS VIDE SYSTEM   Chill food to as low as 37°FFigo uses a dry Peltier system to keep food stored in safe temperatures that prevent spoilage and foodborne illness before and after cooking.Unlike standard fridges, the Peltier system has no moving parts but transfers heat away from your food, safely chilling it down to FDA recommended guidelines (37° F in less than 2 hours). Incredibly power-efficient, it's like having a mini-fridge to hold onto food until it’s time to cook. Heated water surrounds food inside Set the schedule and have water move in and heat up to the exact temperature desired when it's time to start cooking. Thanks to a propeller circulator, water heats up and distributes evenly throughout the cook. This helps flavors meld together while slowly preparing your food. With high-quality temperature sensors, we keep your food cooking at the exact temperature you set  (+/- 1° F variable). Preserve texture and flavorNo one wants mushy meats and vegetables. By removing water after cooking, food maintains maximum texture and flavor.After cooking, water is moved away from your food to help preserve the texture. Salmon remains flaky without extra water pressure, steaks stay tender, and vegetables don’t turn to mush!*Did You Know? — The cooling after cooking helps bring flavor back into the food by absorbing volatile aromas and flavor while chilling. It’s an advanced technique by sous vide creator and chef Bruno Goussault that Figo users can automatically take advantage of it!

Hogan Chef is created by a team of talented individuals with no less than 20 years experience each in their respective fields. A new homemade food delivery app that aims to create income for stay-at-home moms, dads, home cooks and anyone that has a talent in the kitchen, offering multiple delivery options for the convenience of both parties.

<h3>Manufacturing Gummy Bears</h3>
<p>There is a lot that goes into bringing a custom gummy bear recipe to market. The manufacturing process is lengthy and costly. We had no idea when we started down this path.</p>
<p>That’s probably why there isn’t another product like this on the market. But we decided that it had to be done anyway.</p>
<p>We’ve created a perfect recipe. Designed the packaging. And we are almost ready to release our Awesome Gummy Bears to the world.</p>
<p>Gummy bears can’t be made in small batches at home for retail purposes because they can’t be made at any volume and it’s not sustainable…</p>
<p>Gummy bears are made on very specific equipment and the smallest commercial run is 25,000 pounds which works out to 200,000 bags-and that’s only if we can guarantee bigger runs in the future. The equipment alone for a gummy line costs over a million dollars. We checked.</p>
<p>But right now, we have a state-of-the-art facility here in the USA standing by to make our Awesome Gummy Bears, we just need your help funding it.</p>

With only these three steps, you can easily take in fermented foods into your diet. In addition, Tsukemono reduces food waste. Did you know that 1.3 billion tons of food are thrown away every year in the world? Vegetable skins, roots, and leaves that are usually thrown away can also be pickled.
 Let's practice zero waste life with Picklestone! 
There are pickles that can be made in just one night.A common way of making pickles, requires soaking the vegetables in brine and waiting for them to ferment - which can take a long time.However, the Japanese pickles ""Tsukemono"" only take overnight. With Picklestone, it's surprisingly easy to make.【Picklestone220】SIZE:d100mm×H215mm WEIGHT:1170g【Picklestone150】SIZE:d100mm×H135mm WEIGHT:800g【Picklestone115】SIZE:d65mm×H185mm WEIGHT:600gHow to usehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXPq6JdBY9Y To make Tsukemono, you need to first drain the water from the vegetables and make a bacteria-free environment for the vegetables by using salt. Preservation power improves by salt entering the vegetable fiber, and the number of lactic acid bacteria increases, and the sourness of the pickle is produced. Easy as that, now you have Japanese style pickles. Why put a stone?Why can pickles be made in just one day? The secret lies in the weight. By applying pressure vertically to a cylindrical glass pot, the speed at which water is drained from the vegetables increases, and this is how the pickles get their unique texture! Pickled vegetables are completed in about 4 hours for finely cut vegetables.In addition, when we seal the container with the stone, the pickles do not come in contact with air and the preservation power improves.Health benefits of Japanese picklesIf you can't eat a large volume of raw vegetables, pickle them and you can get plenty of fiber and vitamins. In addition, the effect of lactic acid bacteria improves the intestinal environment. Japanese-style pickles are the perfect vegan superfood. Why not make them a part of your daily diet?  Smart design without waste1. Picklestone can be stored in the refrigerator doorIts smart design saves space even in a small kitchen. Pickles can be made even for one person.2. Simple structure Stones and wood are hygienic, and easily removed for cleaning. After use, dry it and store it in the shade. About the stone For the Picklestone sold in Japan, we use the highest quality ""Aji stone"" from Kagawa, Japan's which is known for stones.  Used in the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Torch, garden stones of the Prime Minister's Office, and hot springs dedicated to the Emperor, we use precious stone mined from a that has lasted for the past 400 years. Our missionHow can we ensure that not only Japanese people but also people from other countries enjoy pickles?There are two problems that need to be solved.The first is that after you receive the product, you do not have the ingredients on hand.Japanese pickles require salt, Konbu, and dried red chili.But we learned that getting Konbu outside of Japan was much harder than we imagined.Of course, it is possible to make pickles with just salt, but we wanted people to enjoy more traditional pickles, so we decided to include the Picklestone starter kit.With this, all you need to do is prepare the vegetables you have at home and you can start making pickles right away the day you receive them.The second challenge is that many people are not familiar with the taste of Japanese pickles, so the person making the pickles cannot judge whether the taste of the pickles made according to the recipe is correct or not. For those who are making pickles for the first time, we decided to develop a perfect original soy sauce that is much easier to use. All you have to do is put soy sauce into the pot with the vegetables. There is no risk of failure.We developed our own original blend of soy sauce.The added flavor of the shiitake mushrooms changes the taste of the pickles for the better.It is also free of animal ingredients, so it can be eaten by vegans.About the recipeWe enclose a booklet with 12 recipes for pickles made with salt, which should be your first step, and also 20 recipes for dishes arranged with pickles made with magic soy sauce.We developed a new set to introduce people to traditional Japanese pickles.

Food is about flavour.With an Acqua Garden, you’ll rediscover the real flavour of strawberries, tomatoes, basil, sweet peppers, coriander, butterhead lettuce and everything else you grow. Once you eat food from an Acqua Garden, we guarantee you will never go back. Sustainability is at the core of the Acqua Garden’s design. With an Acqua Garden you are growing sustainably. With all of our challenges with the environment, climate change and other critical issues, we are doing our part. There are many environmental benefits with the Acqua Garden including:Reduce your consumption of shop-bought produce. The food you buy in the store has a huge carbon footprint. By growing your own, you’ll reduce this dramatically.Save water. The Acqua Garden uses up to 90% less water than conventional growing. Water is a valuable commodity. Conserve it with an Acqua Garden.Coconut coir growing medium. We are a peat free business, our peat bogs should be protected! Coco coir is sustainable, renewable and 100% organic.Low energy consumption. The Acqua Garden uses very little power. A micro pump uses just 14 watts of electricity, a few minutes a day. Our solar version is even better, using the power of the sun.Recyclable. We use 100% recyclable food grade HDPE 2 plastic and operate a ‘Circle of Life’ policy. At the end of its life, we will offer to  take back your Acqua Garden and have it all recycled.The Acqua Garden is available globally and for purchases in this campaign, we will ship FREE of charge to the purchaser, in accordance with our terms and conditions.We look forward to seeing Acqua Gardens all over the world, providing a new way of gardening to the widest range of people, everywhere.",35.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Bear Bagels</h3>
<p>Bear Bagels was born at Easter in 2020, as Melbourne locked down and went into hibernation. </p>
<p>Baker and chef Erik Koel had closed up shop at his Healesville cafe, Hominy Southern Kitchen, which was just a year old. Times were tough for hospitality venues, especially fledgling ones.</p>
<p>To keep busy, Erik began making hot cross buns out of our home kitchen to supply our friends' Mitcham cafe, The Mabel. </p>
<p>Having spent years as a baker at Silo in Canberra, at Melbourne’s Rathdowne Street Food Store and at Healesville’s Innocent Bystander/Giant Steps, Erik found that returning to baking was like coming home.</p>
<p>He began making bagels and other baked treats, and delivering them to The Mabel and locally in Healesville.</p>
<p>As lockdown eased, markets started up again. Erik started baking through the night, then heading straight to a market, accompanied by our hardworking 13-year-old, Lu, to see everything snapped up in few hours. </p>
<p>Our home kitchen couldn't keep up with demand.</p>
<p>It was time for a proper set-up. It was time for a fully equipped Bear Bagelry.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We’ve taken the lease on a Yarra Valley location and planned and costed the fit-out.  </p>
<p>In addition to our own investment, we'll need $35,000 to purchase bakery equipment and have the required plumbing and electrical work carried out. </p>
<p>In return for your support, you will receive a Bear Bagels voucher and a shout-out on social media, along with our sincere gratitude. There’s also the option to choose an exclusive T-shirt featuring our Bear Bagels logo, designed by Sean Zachariah. </p>
<p>PLUS the first 50 people to support the campaign and share it on social media using #bearbagels will receive an invitation to the Bear Bagels launch party, where you know the food will be GOOD. There’ll be bagels, there’ll be sweet treats, there’ll be so much more.</p>

<h3>
<br/>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We will need bagelry and delivery staff as soon as production hits its stride. We are also keen to take on a baking apprentice. The more successful this campaign is, the sooner we can add to our team and the more hours we'll be able to open the bagelry each week. </p>
<p>Hominy Southern Kitchen employed two part-time staff as well as catering staff for functions. All staff members were local. We can't wait to employ locals again.</p>
<p>If the campaign goes super-well, we'll be able to buy the equipment we need to make baguettes and focaccia, a range of sourdough products, and speciality items such as <i>shokupan</i> (Japanese milk bread).</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Bear Bagels has gone from strength to strength, even through the challenges of Melbourne's lockdowns and travel restrictions. While the bagelry is being built, Erik will continue to produce from our home kitchen to ensure that the business remains stable (and those bagels keep coming!) </p>
<p>Erik has worked in senior roles in two hospitality openings: Little Hugh cafe (where he was head chef) and Meletos (where he was sous chef). He has a wealth of experience planning and overseeing kitchen fit-outs and has worked as a consultant to other hospitality ventures, helping them plan their kitchens and menus. </p>
<p>We have factored delays in securing electrical and plumbing work into our plans, because lockdowns are a certainty over the next couple of months. No matter what, we'll get the bagelry doors open in time for summer 2021–22.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute financially, it would mean the world to us if you could share our campaign in your networks. Indiegogo has share tools to make that as easy as possible.</p>

<h3>Chocolates of Glenshiel needs your help to build a new home. Join us on our Highland adventure as we create a chocolate factory that Willy Wonka would be proud of!</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where We Started</strong></h3>
<p>In 2016 after finishing high school, Finlay followed his passion for artisanal chocolate and his love of his Highland home and founded Chocolates of Glenshiel. In the five years since, he’s managed to recruit a wee team of folk who share his passion and strong values.</p>
<p>At Chocolates of Glenshiel we set out to bring people a true taste of Scotland; our chocolates are inspired by our Highland home – the beautiful scenery and the everchanging seasons - and created using the finest Scottish ingredients. We strive to be a force for good in every aspect of business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our environmental impact is closely monitored and considered before any decisions are taken.</li>
<li>Our small Highland community is very important to us and we do everything we can to support and uplift it.</li>
<li>We bring people together through the medium of chocolate!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where We Are Now</strong></h3>
<p>Since we began, we’ve been handcrafting our chocolates in a wee cabin in Ratagan, Glenshiel. This cabin has been so great to us – it’s offered us a chocolate production site as well as a small shop where we’ve been able to welcome one or two customers in at a time. Now, thanks to the amazing support of these customers, we’re in the blessed position of having vastly outgrown our cabin. We’re struggling to keep up with production demand and due to taking on new team members and expanding our office, we no longer have room for our shop or to have any customers in to experience our craft. It’s time to build a new home for Chocolates of Glenshiel.</p>
<p>So, we’re moving! We have secured new premises for our business just down the road from where we are now, at the foot of the Five Sisters of Kintail in the heart of Glenshiel. Somewhere with enough room for us all; somewhere we can really put our stamp on and call our own.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630493741/ghsegpwiu7dlerzjetum.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where We’re Going</strong></h3>
<p>Our customers are at the heart of everything we do. We strongly believe that delicious, quality chocolate is for everyone and that everyone should be able to experience it fully. As we’re sure you already know, chocolate is one of the few universally adored foods and really does have the ability to bring people together – there’s nothing else quite like it! We want to be able to welcome our customers into our business; allow them to see, smell and fully understand our chocolate, not just taste it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630493953/bh1u3eoxliowerwuk2uk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Now, we don’t want to brag, but we’ve got the chocolate bit down - that’s good to go. What we need is space and our new chocolate centre has space by the bucketload! We want to build a big (yet cosy) seating area with views into the chocolate kitchen on one side and out on to the Five Sisters of Kintail mountains on the other, with a private seating area for guided tastings; a café serving delicious, fresh, local produce; and a shop selling beautiful, unique Scottish goodies (we’re on the lookout for things to stock – shoot us a message on Facebook or Instagram if you have any suggestions!). That’s a big ask – we know – but we know we can do it.</p>
<p>Now, this is where you come in.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>We're hoping to raise £8,000. This will go towards creating our chocolate tasting experience, a window into the chocolate kitchen and making sure our seating area is the perfect, cosy spot to enjoy a cuppa, a chocolate and a blether. In exchange for your help we have lots of tasty treats and exciting experiences to offer you!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where We’ll Do It </strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630495342/rern6lzx4vah29tuxz4p.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Glenshiel is located 65 miles west of Inverness, around 7 miles south of Eilean Donan Castle, 15 miles south of Kyle of Lochalsh and 17 miles south of the Skye Bridge.

Our new chocolate kitchen will give us increased production capacity, allowing us to boost wholesale sales. </p>
<p>Secondly, we are very people-orientated and we know that hiring the right team is essential to any successful business. In order to hire the right people, the right people need to be available! Glenshiel - and much of the Highlands in general - has a lack of available workers and accommodation which may become an issue for us in the future. </p>

</div></div>","Chocolates of Glenshiel needs your help to build a new home. Join us on our Highland adventure as we create a chocolate factory that Willy Wonka would be proud of!
 
Where We Started
In 2016 after finishing high school, Finlay followed his passion for artisanal chocolate and his love of his Highland home and founded Chocolates of Glenshiel. In the five years since, he’s managed to recruit a wee team of folk who share his passion and strong values.
At Chocolates of Glenshiel we set out to bring people a true taste of Scotland; our chocolates are inspired by our Highland home – the beautiful scenery and the everchanging seasons - and created using the finest Scottish ingredients. We strive to be a force for good in every aspect of business:

Our environmental impact is closely monitored and considered before any decisions are taken.
Our small Highland community is very important to us and we do everything we can to support and uplift it.
We bring people together through the medium of chocolate!

 
Where We Are Now
Since we began, we’ve been handcrafting our chocolates in a wee cabin in Ratagan, Glenshiel. This cabin has been so great to us – it’s offered us a chocolate production site as well as a small shop where we’ve been able to welcome one or two customers in at a time. Now, thanks to the amazing support of these customers, we’re in the blessed position of having vastly outgrown our cabin. We’re struggling to keep up with production demand and due to taking on new team members and expanding our office, we no longer have room for our shop or to have any customers in to experience our craft. It’s time to build a new home for Chocolates of Glenshiel.
So, we’re moving! We have secured new premises for our business just down the road from where we are now, at the foot of the Five Sisters of Kintail in the heart of Glenshiel. Somewhere with enough room for us all; somewhere we can really put our stamp on and call our own.

 
Where We’re Going
Our customers are at the heart of everything we do. We strongly believe that delicious, quality chocolate is for everyone and that everyone should be able to experience it fully. As we’re sure you already know, chocolate is one of the few universally adored foods and really does have the ability to bring people together – there’s nothing else quite like it! We want to be able to welcome our customers into our business; allow them to see, smell and fully understand our chocolate, not just taste it.

Now, we don’t want to brag, but we’ve got the chocolate bit down - that’s good to go. What we need is space and our new chocolate centre has space by the bucketload! We want to build a big (yet cosy) seating area with views into the chocolate kitchen on one side and out on to the Five Sisters of Kintail mountains on the other, with a private seating area for guided tastings; a café serving delicious, fresh, local produce; and a shop selling beautiful, unique Scottish goodies (we’re on the lookout for things to stock – shoot us a message on Facebook or Instagram if you have any suggestions!). That’s a big ask – we know – but we know we can do it.
Now, this is where you come in.
 
What We Need
We're hoping to raise £8,000. This will go towards creating our chocolate tasting experience, a window into the chocolate kitchen and making sure our seating area is the perfect, cosy spot to enjoy a cuppa, a chocolate and a blether. In exchange for your help we have lots of tasty treats and exciting experiences to offer you!
 
Where We’ll Do It 

Glenshiel is located 65 miles west of Inverness, around 7 miles south of Eilean Donan Castle, 15 miles south of Kyle of Lochalsh and 17 miles south of the Skye Bridge. At the moment, Glenshiel is a place without much recognition. Despite the breath-taking views and world-class walking and climbing routes, there is not much tourism in the area – Glenshiel is a place driven through rather than to.
Our new premises is located right on the main road to the Skye Bridge which sees around 5,000 cars per day. Our chocolate centre will put Glenshiel on the map – the visitors are already here, they just need something to do!

This makes porcelain pores extremely fine, making it easy to clean and prevents any stain and smell to linger on it. Say goodbye to coffee stainsOne of the popular question being asked: What is the main difference between porcelain and ceramic? The main difference is the size of surface pores. Ceramic has relatively larger pores compared to porcelain, resulting in stain might still occur in common ceramic. Which it will not happen in porcelain.No Peeling OffAnother common question to be asked is what is the difference between solid porcelain and ceramic coating? Ceramic coatings is only a coating, it might peel off and having the risk of peel off residues to be consumed. Swanz Kokoro interior made of 100% Solid Fine Porcelain.

<p>After a glass of wine or two, what do you do with the bottle? There is still wine in there, after all. You want to be able to pick back up right where you've left off. When you pour another glass – tomorrow, the next day, or a week from now – you want to feel confident that the wine is going to taste and feel just as good as it did the first time around. If you go shopping for wine stoppers, though, you are going to find two options, neither ideal: wine stoppers that are expensive and wine stoppers that are complicated.</p>
<p>The Auto Stopper is different. Both affordable and straightforward, it makes it easy for you to hold on to your bottle of wine, saving it until you are ready to finish it at your next meal or once the next weekend rolls around. Keeping your wine fresh for a full 7 to 10 days, the Auto Stopper ensures that every glass is lovely, whether the bottle is brand-new or now.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: After installing two AAA batteries, you place the Auto Stopper on the bottle and press down. The Auto Stopper then does all of the work for you, kicking its vacuum function into action, as signaled via the blue indicator light on top. Once the Auto Stopper has completed its vacuum function, the green indicator light will let you know.</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>We are now turning to you to help raise the funds that we need to manufacture, market, and distribute the Auto Stopper on a large scale. Our goal through this campaign is $20,000, which will cover the costs that we are facing as we put in our minimum order quantities and promote the Auto Stopper to casual wine drinkers far and wide.</p>
<p>To say thanks to everyone who contributes to this campaign, we are offering early access to the Auto Stopper exclusively through this campaign. That means for a limited time only, by acting now, you can get an Auto Stopper of your own before anyone else does.</p>
<p>Just make a contribution and pre-order now!</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p> At the time of this campaign launch, we are approximately one month away from delivering the Auto Stopper's initial orders. We do not foresee any additional challenges arising – at least, nothing that would cause a delay in our timeline. Regardless, you can count on us to remain transparent throughout this process, letting you know of all the progress we are making.</p>
<p>One More Way to Help</p>
<p>In addition to making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can show your support for the Auto Stopper by sharing a link to the campaign page on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use. The more people are aware of the Auto Stopper before we start shipping out pre-orders and promoting it to a broader audience, the smoother the next several months will go for us.</p>
<p>We appreciate all your support, both monetary and non-monetary, and we thank you for your time.</p>

<h3>Spotted Octopus Brewing Company!</h3>
<p>Our focus is to build an atmosphere unlike any of the existing taprooms in the city’s booming craft brewing industry by bringing unique and experimental offerings in small revolving batches.

We hope that all of you that are passionate about craft beer, local small businesses and pushing the limits of what is available in your community, will consider becoming a supporter. We are a brewery for those that love different flavors and will not settle for the same old beer day after day week after week. Our intention is to be a place for all people, all lifestyles to come be comfortable and drink great beer and crafted cocktails. Your contributions will not only validate our mission and your desire for more options, but it will also ultimately help us reach our goal of being an anchor in Buffalo, NY.</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>To serve the greater Buffalo area effectively with our awesome brews, we need to invest in furnishing our taproom. Without tables and seating, we will not be able to have a comfortable environment for our customers. Without keg racks, we will not be able to adequately stock our walk-in cold room to keep the draft lines full of delicious beer. Your support will help us finish the aesthetics with matching lighting, shelves, and other décor. Which will help make it a comfortable place where people want to hang out. Without these items our tap house will struggle to become a place where people enjoy each other’s company.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While these items may not seem the most exciting, they are critical for our success. Your donation to Spotted Octopus will help us to produce a quality product that can be shared and enjoyed in a great location in the heart of the city. This campaign is intended to be completely transparent. So contact us with any questions you may have.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Startup breweries are labor and capital intensive, and our plan is to avoid as much commercial debt as we can. We’ve done our due diligence researching every possible roadblock we can think of but, as with any new business, unforeseen expenses and delays could be a challenge. Fall of 2021 is our goal for opening and we’re working towards that goal in every spare moment. Lots of great people are behind us — and we hope to include you! Thank you!</p>

Our focus is to build an atmosphere unlike any of the existing taprooms in the city’s booming craft brewing industry by bringing unique and experimental offerings in small revolving batches. All of our beers will be made with a majority of NY products and NY grown ingredients.  The snacks and lite fare we will serve will be obtained by local small business around the city.

<p>Hi my name is Marlon and I would like to tell you a little bit about my story. I’m from Los Valles Centrales Oaxaca and moved to Los Angeles 10 years ago. It was here where I discovered my passion for coffee and what I could express through it. A couple of years later I met Pilar, and I never imagined we would start the Café Santo journey together.</p>
<p>We have been serving our community since 2016, making coffee at Farmers Markets, pop-ups, private events, and festivals. As a locally-owned family business, connecting with our community is what we have loved the most as part of this experience.</p>
<p>Last year, we found a perfect place to take Café Santo to the next chapter, a place where we could open a permanent location at BLVD MRKT in Montebello. Establishing our first brick-and-mortar will allow us to serve the community by providing a space where they can enjoy quality coffee, specialty Oaxacan chocolate, and a light breakfast that will include some classic items from my hometown. As Montebello residents, we know our city needs a space to build community. We want to unite our community by offering workshops and create a space for art, music, and cultural events that everyone can have access to. </p>
<p>It’s been an adventure full of surprises and experiences, and most recently we’re reminded once more that without our family, friends, and beloved costumers, Café Santo wouldn’t have come this far. We truly believe coffee connects people in a magical way. It is your support that keeps us going.</p>
<p>As we are preparing for this milestone in our business, we have created a fundraiser with the hopes that you can continue to support and contribute to make our first coffee shop a reality and help us grow our community.</p>
<p>Our team and incredibly talented artists Mariana Rodriguez Fernandez (from Oaxaca) and Juan Renteria (Born in Cuernavaca, raised in LA), have designed special and unique pieces to help raise funds. These funds will allow us to finish building the space that is being created with lots of love and gratitude for our community. As we continue to look forward despite adversity, your kind contribution will help finish building the space and make this a successful transition from mobile services to our first brick and mortar shop. You can also help by sharing this message, or even cheering us on until we reach our goal. </p>

<p>An overnight success story, 23 years in the making?</p>
<p><strong>When Jennie - the owner of beloved Chicago vegan restaurant Kitchen 17 - stopped eating meat at 6 years old, nobody knew that her passion for animals and the environment would bring her to creating a nationally distributed brand, but here we are!</strong> All vegan and made from scratch. Now, we are asking for your support, in exchange for delicious and rad rewards, as we expand.</p>
<p>All of our ""perks"" are fair market value and <strong>exclusive</strong> to this campaign! Want to try the classics? Check out kitchen17.com - we appreciate and value your support any way you slice it!</p>
<p>Launching “the original vegan deep dish” frozen pizzas had been quietly in development for years before we pushed the green button - a little earlier than expected. <strong>We launched in March 2020, the day after lockdown started in Chicago. </strong>When over 1000 orders came in on the first day, we wondered if it was a fluke… but it wasn’t. Online orders have been consistent and we now ship nationally! Kitchen 17 was also just named the #2 <strong>BEST VEGAN RESTAURANT IN THE NATION</strong> by vegan authority VegOut. The vibes are excellent.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the problem: the entire restaurant is now a pizza factory… and the pizza factory is too small. </strong></p>
<p>We need to get the restaurant open, and <i><strong>we just went into contract on a building</strong></i>. It’s happening, and it’s perfect. </p>
<p><strong>It’s also large enough to accommodate Smiley Face Media </strong>- Jennie’s sister Lorry, and brother-in-law, Rick’s media production company - who are conveniently now living 5 minutes from the building after relocating from Los Angeles in March (thank you again, pandemic)! They handle a lot of Kitchen 17's content, branding, packaging, and marketing - <strong>things like this campaign's video.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The building is located in Huntington, Indiana - the old newspaper building</strong> right across from the courthouse and Little River. At the heart of this story, is the fact that Huntington is Lorry and Jennie’s hometown, with family lines on both sides going back generations. </p>
<p><strong>Our goal of 750k covers the cost of the building, the initial buildout and equipment for the pizza factory, and the initial labor for our new hires. </strong>Jennie’s visions have never been limited to pizza - we have a master plan to bring healthy, fresh, delicious plant-based foods to all the hard-to-reach places: small towns, public schools, nursing homes, hospitals… everywhere we can, one step at a time.</p>
<p>As soon as the pizza factory is up and running, we will begin building out “The Newsroom” - in the old newsroom - a spin-off of Kitchen 17, as well as being Huntington, Indiana’s first plant-based restaurant and coworking space. The building has a riverfront area perfect for outdoor dining, and there’s never been a better time to bring vegan food to a small town in the Midwest. <strong>For those of you that have had Kitchen 17 - you know - it’s not just good, it’s d*mn good. Craveable. Distinct.</strong> The kind of vegan food that people who “hate vegan food” find delicious. </p>
<p>Once that’s up and rolling, we are going to convert the basement into a wild mushroom farm (a much cleaner project than it sounds), and add greenhouses onto the rooftop with space for rooftop dining and events. We know, we know - one step at a time. By ultimately maximizing the square footage for sustainable endeavors that relate to the business (<strong>wild mushroom pizza!</strong>) and by enhancing the arts and entertainment options in Huntington, we create a blueprint for how small towns… or big towns, anywhere... can turn unutilized, historically relevant buildings into something really rad and with real utility.  </p>

<h3>Who is Brew -N- Krew? </h3>
<p>Brew -N- Krew Ale House is a new brewery coming to Salinas City Center (downtown Salinas) late Winter. </p>
<p>We need your help TODAY to bring BREW -N- KREW ALE HOUSE - the first brewery out of Salinas owned by a locals who decided to turn their hobby into a reality. Take a look at the perks we have established and click on them for more details. If more clarification is needed, feel free to send us an email. </p>
<p>When this project started, we had three conditions:  to implement our Mexican/Salinas culture in every beer made, any public event hosted would be family friendly, and regardless of the circumstances we'd always try to give back to our loving community.</p>
<p>'Till this day we have been able to stay true to our conditions. </p>
<p>What started as a hobby is about to be the new wave in Downtown Salinas! Donate today and help create a permanent space for locals to celebrate our community culture while drinking craft beer. </p>

<h3><i>MAKING DOPE BEER CON CULTURA! </i></h3>
<h3>WE NEED YOUR HELP BRINGING BREW -N- KREW ALE HOUSE TO SALINAS, CA. </h3>
<p>If you have walked down main street by the cinema you have most likely seen our COMING SOON sign. Our brewery and tasting room home will be 155 Main Street (in between Maya Cinema &amp; Villa Azteca). We are beyond excited to open our doors very soon to every single one of you. It's been a long journey and it is <i>slowly</i> coming together. </p>

<p>The concept of brewing our own beer started in our garage. We used to travel up and down CA visiting breweries. We love collecting and investing in beer cans from the West and East Coast. One day we decided to invest in the love we have for beer and we began to make it. We are family oriented and are committed to building a legacy of pouring exceptional craft beer. We are driven by the idea of adding our Mexican/Salinas cultura to our brew in every batch we make. Nonetheless, we want to continue making dope beer, have fun and celebrate life everyday.</p>

Nonetheless, it’s expensive, but the end result is empowering.  With your contribution today, you will help remind our community that anything can be accomplished with hard work, dedication, corazon, creativity, intelligence and support from one another. We want everyone to know that there are great people/business in Salinas, Ca. We want people to come visit us and see the authenticity we're bringing to Downtown Salinas.

<h3>IF WE DO NOT MEET OUR GOAL...</h3>
<p>Even if we do not reach our goal, we will still move forward with opening the brewery/tasting room.

<p>Many of you, along with our family and friends, have seen this grow from the ground up and we appreciate you. There is still a lot of work to be done. There is a lot of great people working along us to make it happen. </p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, we will continue to work hard, have patience, make dope beer con cultura and have fun while doing so.

Brew -N- Krew Ale House is a new brewery coming to Salinas City Center (downtown Salinas) late Winter. 
We need your help TODAY to bring BREW -N- KREW ALE HOUSE - the first brewery out of Salinas owned by a locals who decided to turn their hobby into a reality. Take a look at the perks we have established and click on them for more details. If more clarification is needed, feel free to send us an email. 
When this project started, we had three conditions:  to implement our Mexican/Salinas culture in every beer made, any public event hosted would be family friendly, and regardless of the circumstances we'd always try to give back to our loving community.
'Till this day we have been able to stay true to our conditions. 
What started as a hobby is about to be the new wave in Downtown Salinas! Donate today and help create a permanent space for locals to celebrate our community culture while drinking craft beer. 


MAKING DOPE BEER CON CULTURA! 
WE NEED YOUR HELP BRINGING BREW -N- KREW ALE HOUSE TO SALINAS, CA. 
If you have walked down main street by the cinema you have most likely seen our COMING SOON sign. Our brewery and tasting room home will be 155 Main Street (in between Maya Cinema & Villa Azteca). We are beyond excited to open our doors very soon to every single one of you. It's been a long journey and it is slowly coming together. 

The concept of brewing our own beer started in our garage. We used to travel up and down CA visiting breweries. We love collecting and investing in beer cans from the West and East Coast. One day we decided to invest in the love we have for beer and we began to make it. We are family oriented and are committed to building a legacy of pouring exceptional craft beer. We are driven by the idea of adding our Mexican/Salinas cultura to our brew in every batch we make. Nonetheless, we want to continue making dope beer, have fun and celebrate life everyday.


Proud of one of our brewers who was featured in the Monterey Weekly! http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/people/face_to_face/marlene-garc-a/article_8bed3a94-a35b-11e9-aec4-7322af9195c1.html
A COMMUNITY EFFORT
As you can imagine, to fund a project of this magnitude is no walk in the park. It is hard and stressful. A lot of sacrifices have been made to make this dream of ours happen. Nonetheless, it’s expensive, but the end result is empowering.  With your contribution today, you will help remind our community that anything can be accomplished with hard work, dedication, corazon, creativity, intelligence and support from one another. We want everyone to know that there are great people/business in Salinas, Ca. We want people to come visit us and see the authenticity we're bringing to Downtown Salinas.

It also accelerates flowering in some plants. For experienced farmers or those who love the geeky stuffs, nutrient solutions can be adjusted to get the desired taste and leaf structure.  Increasing the EC is a proven way to increase flavour in many hydroponic crops. An individual can grow super-foods microgreens together with herbs or leafy greens using the included accessories. Aside from viewing the latest photo, you can enjoy watching your plants growth with time lapse video feature.  You can view these remotely so you have less worry when you're on holidays. There are 13 environmental sensors installed in the garden to monitor your plants.  The data are sent securely to the cloud and can be viewed anywhere through your companion App.           LAGWERTA is an Agritech Start-up company that focuses on Urban Farming.  We develop technology that will transform people’s perception of farming.  Our vision is to help people become sustainable by growing their food, eating fresh produce and, most importantly, clean and healthy greens and herbs without pesticides or GMOs.  Our long-term vision is to provide communities easy access to healthy produce all year round and help farmers use our technology to increase their productivity and yield. Our team comprises Engineers, Data Scientist, Software Developers,  a finance officer, and a retail manager.  We are confident in our strength as a team to deliver this product.  We spent most of our time developing the technology started by one of our members five years ago.  In 2019, we finally made it official to start our journey in making this innovative product a possibility.   LAGWERTA  started on year 2019 and has been doing lots of prototyping and testing with our system.  We have already contacted a few manufacturers and will start production as soon as we reach our funding goals.  Our system is ready and the software has been tested for stability.  We are just soaking the system by running it with our current hardware solutions to test the stability while developing the database at the back end.  We are committed to delivering the product on time.  We have manufactured and developed our intelligent systems and software here in Australia.  The Demeter Mini perks are available to Australia, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Philippines and Qatar.Shipping costs do not include any taxes or duties, which are applied by your local government and customs office, on imported goods.  The backer is responsible for any customs duties, foreign taxes or other fees which may be imposed.Should the backer refuse to pay duties and taxes applied by customs,  the responsibility lies with the backer to arrange for the order to be returned to us in order to receive a refund.Please contact your local customs office directly for more information on taxes, duties and regulations. We already had three significant versions since we started this project.  With each version, we have learned how to make it simple and easy for the user.  We made sure that it is well designed and crafted with a minimalist and modern feel so you can proudly display it at your home.Unfortunately, with most of the projects, often the problem comes with unforeseen issues on manufacturing or shipping timelines.  But having said that, we know that we have action plans ready when these things come.  We will make sure to check from time to time with our suppliers and manufacturers.  We do believe that we will be able to deliver the best and reliable product.  This would revolutionise the field of urban farming.  Rest assured that we will communicate to our customers for updates and status when it comes to production. Even if it's just $10, every contribution helps us in getting closer to make Demeter Mini a reality.If you can't contribute to this project financially, there are other ways to helps us.You can follow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube and join us in making home farming much easier and fun.You can spread the word about Demeter Mini.  Tell your family, friends, neighbours, colleagues and everybody you know about our product and our vision in leading the way to healthier community through having easy access to fresh and healthy food all the time.",39.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>The Flour Girl Bakery started as a small group in July of 2019. I started testing sourdough and passing it out for free to friends who wanted to try it. A lot of people wanted ""in""!</p>
<p>After becoming a licensed Cottage Food Bakery in December of that year I started officially selling bread. It was a very informal setup... when your bread was ready you would get a text from me telling you which box it was in on my front porch!</p>
<p>Without any actual culinary training, 3 other jobs, and 3 small kids at home, there was very little thought this would ever turn into anything more than a hobby. Boy was I wrong!</p>
<p>As we went into crazy 2020, and suddenly there was no bread in the grocery stores but you could order a loaf from me, get a text and pick it up warm off my front porch!</p>
<p>But my little bakery wasn't so little anymore! And soon the weekly ordering started selling out so fast that we had to start a lottery system. If you ""won the bread lottery"" you were able to order for the following week with a limit of only 1 item per person! </p>
<p>We needed to get bigger and quickly. We had a lot of ideas on how to do that, unfortunately, none of them worked. When our final effort to build a food cart to sell the bread from at another location came crashing down with hurricane-force winds and we were out of ideas. </p>
<p>And this is where things started to turn around. St. Peters Church came to the rescue, offering both a place to bake and a place to sell. I was able to get a commercial license, set up shop in the church kitchen, and start selling all in the same place. </p>
<p>Then, amazingly, I was connected with a family who had just purchased a historic home in downtown Hebron and they wanted The Flour Girl Bakery to open inside that building. There was so much excitement, confusion, shock, and fear but I finally decided to move forward. </p>
<p>And that is was brought me here! </p>

<h3>What you receive for participating in crowdfunding...</h3>
<p>The way crowdfunding works is that you support the business upfront to help with the costs of start-up and in return, you receive something from the business that you can't get anywhere else, something special. I have worked very hard in making a list of special items that will only be available during this initial start-up phase. Thank you so much for your consideration and your support. </p>

<h3>The Biscuit: A Somerville/Cambridge Institution</h3>
<p>  After 15 years at 406 Washington St, and 6 years of fruitless negotiation with an unreasonable landlord, The Biscuit will be forced to close on 12/31/19. We did not lose the space due to rent increase, nor because the space will be demolished for condo development. We lost the space because the owner of the property wants it empty and fallow, like the majority of their other properties in the neighborhood. This eviction is devastating, both for The Biscuit, its many, many employees, and the neighboring community. </p>
<p>  We have found a new location, however, and it's in the area! It's a unique space, and subterranean, but also a short walking distance from our old spot. It does require a significant amount of renovation, and re-imagination. For the very short term, it will be a storage spot for all of our equipment and inventory. But in the long term, it can become a new oasis for baked goods and savory fare, salads and coffee creations.  We just need a little help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>  We're looking for fans of The Biscuit to contribute what they can to help us start up a new version of their old favorite. In return, you'll receive gift cards for purchases at the new Biscuit (currently under the moniker, Biscuit in the Basement).  The value of the gift cards will exceed the value of the gift. </p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, we've set our renovation costs at $150,000. We already own and possess the equipment and inventory - just need to redevelop the space and make it food-friendly. If you were within walking distance of the old Biscuit, you are absolutely within walking distance of the New Biscuit! </li>
<li>Any donations will be rewarded with gift cards redeemable at the New Biscuit at a greater value than the donation!</li>
<li>If we are unable to reach our complete goal, your donation will still be honored to the best of our ability. We are using a flexible fund strategy - funds raised will be used as soon as they are available.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>    The Biscuit has been a viable business serving the Cambridge/Somerville Community for more than 15 years. We started our business with loans from friends and family, and we paid off those friends and family within 7 years. We hold a tremendous sense of pride in knowing that we've owned the business outright these last 8 years. Unfortunately, not being able to continue to lease the property further puts a dent in that pride, so...  any investment in our future business is priority to us, and we absolutely value any investment made in our new project. We are greatly appreciative of donations of any denomination.</p>
<p>  We also understand that there is a risk to the lender in any situation such as this. We will diligently do our best to honor any and all funds contributed, as we have in the past, but this time through this platform, and will do so with an in-kind gift rather than an interest based loan. If, however, we are unable to sustain a viable business in the new location, we will not be capable of honoring un-redeemed gift cards.  That said, we hope that, with your kind donation, you will allow us a window of time to get on our feet before redeeming your gift cards, but we will certainly not turn anyone away who presents a gift card in our early days.</p>
<p>  The Biscuit honored its commitments in the past, and it has every interest in doing so in the future.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>  If you're unable to make a contribution, we totally understand - we've been there ourselves.  However, there are other ways you can help:</p>

  After 15 years at 406 Washington St, and 6 years of fruitless negotiation with an unreasonable landlord, The Biscuit will be forced to close on 12/31/19. We did not lose the space due to rent increase, nor because the space will be demolished for condo development. We lost the space because the owner of the property wants it empty and fallow, like the majority of their other properties in the neighborhood. This eviction is devastating, both for The Biscuit, its many, many employees, and the neighboring community. 
  We have found a new location, however, and it's in the area! It's a unique space, and subterranean, but also a short walking distance from our old spot. It does require a significant amount of renovation, and re-imagination. For the very short term, it will be a storage spot for all of our equipment and inventory. But in the long term, it can become a new oasis for baked goods and savory fare, salads and coffee creations.  We just need a little help.

What We Need & What You Get
  We're looking for fans of The Biscuit to contribute what they can to help us start up a new version of their old favorite. In return, you'll receive gift cards for purchases at the new Biscuit (currently under the moniker, Biscuit in the Basement).  The value of the gift cards will exceed the value of the gift. 

Currently, we've set our renovation costs at $150,000. We already own and possess the equipment and inventory - just need to redevelop the space and make it food-friendly. If you were within walking distance of the old Biscuit, you are absolutely within walking distance of the New Biscuit! 
Any donations will be rewarded with gift cards redeemable at the New Biscuit at a greater value than the donation!
If we are unable to reach our complete goal, your donation will still be honored to the best of our ability. We are using a flexible fund strategy - funds raised will be used as soon as they are available. If we are unable to reach our desired goal, well, we'l do whatever we can to get our doors open and get you the goods.

However, we want to create something spectacular, and to do that, we need just a bit more. The funds you donate will thus contribute in pimping up our very first store, making it sparkle amidst a traditional grocery scene screaming for renewal. Specifically speaking, the funds raised will be spent on:</p><ul>
<li>Exterior and Interior of the flagship store, including shelves, flooring, freezers, decor, paint, signage, recycling station, containers, fridges and everything else needed for our very first physical space.</li>
<li>Filling the shelves: Investment in initial product catalogue.</li>
<li>An operational buffer for the first few months of operation.</li>
<li>Deposit for rental premises.</li>
<li>Hired services: Marketing &amp; branding, essential carpentry, electric systems and so forth. </li>

Indeed, we are well on our way towards the goal of making the very first shop a reality. We recently raised MORE THAN USD 200 000 through our first ever capital increase, just enough to get the first shop up and running. However, we want to create something spectacular, and to do that, we need just a bit more. The funds you donate will thus contribute in pimping up our very first store, making it sparkle amidst a traditional grocery scene screaming for renewal. Specifically speaking, the funds raised will be spent on:
Exterior and Interior of the flagship store, including shelves, flooring, freezers, decor, paint, signage, recycling station, containers, fridges and everything else needed for our very first physical space.
Filling the shelves: Investment in initial product catalogue.
An operational buffer for the first few months of operation.
Deposit for rental premises.
Hired services: Marketing & branding, essential carpentry, electric systems and so forth. 
Tech:  POS systems, web development and as a next step; an improved online shop.

<p>In the midst of a global pandemic, Founder Sara Armet woke up one day with a calling to make <i>‘the best chocolate you ever had’.</i>  Designing chocolate bark with larger than life personality became the ultimate remedy for connection during uncertain times.</p>
<p>Word quickly spread of a 24/7 luxury chocolate dispensary, a bootstrapped operation with an open door policy and a sense of humor. Chocolate lovers from far and wide, day and night, ventured to the Upper East Side for a drive-by, a taste, and a woman's wisdom. Lady and the Chocolate was born. </p>
<p>Since inception, Lady and the Chocolate has been a community-driven, collaborative initiative. From recruiting friends as taste-testers and making deliveries on Citi-bike to partnering with NYC based small businesses, including Spice Lab and Candle Cafe,  Lady and the Chocolate boasts an 'all hands on deck' approach. When one of us wins, we all win.</p>

<h3>Are you an Espresso lover?</h3>
<p>We designed this for you: the First Reusable Espresso Cup for Take Away. Your best Espresso always with you.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610028509/jhp7kjb2lu0it5qgbnr9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The cup is part of the tasting experience</h3>
<p>Drinking a good  Espresso coffee is an experience that starts from the bean to the cup. Normal take-away cups don't value your espresso coffee.</p>
<p>Espresso Away with its shape and texture makes you feel like drinking coffee as in the cup at an italian coffee shop.</p>
<p>It is reusable over and over again.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609174766/li9xqdyvd7frlmqy1bxl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Designed to enhance the aromas of coffee</h3>
<ul>
<li>Size of the classic italian espresso cup, 2 oz.</li>
<li> Truncated-conical shape, which allows a better formation and permanence of the cream over time, favoring the best perception of aromas.</li>
<li>The internal base must follow the classic ""egg"" shape to prevent the cream from breaking and to preserve its compactness and color for longer.</li>
<li>The most suitable color for the inside of the cup is bright and glossy white because it facilitates the evaluation of the espresso and, thanks to the strong color contrast, enhances the warm and inviting color of the espresso cream.</li>
<li> The cap with thread guarantees a hermetic seal against spill and can thus be placed in a pocket or bag.</li>
<li>Keeps heat 3 times longer than disposable cups.</li>
</ul>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610028605/nlmmvl2bgrm6vatsaw6n.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>Respect for the Environment</h3>
<p>Espresso Away is reusable and helps reduce the use of disposable cups. Around the world 50 billion are thrown away every year. Most end up in the environment and in the sea. Take part in the movement to reduce disposable cups, every gesture is important.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609175587/blsqfdpugqlslnuq6jcn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Always carry it with you</h3>
<p>You can also use Espresso Away at home to make yourself an espresso before going out.<br/>Or you can use it in the office instead of disposable cups.<br/>Its airtight cap also serves not to dirty after use, you can put it in your pocket or leave it on your desk.</p>
<p>So you can easily clean it with water whenever you want.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609253606/janj3vvzeuncmpx24atz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Approved by professional barista</h3>
<p><br/><strong>Giacomo lo Cascio, Italian coffee cup tasting champion, World cup finalist and professional barista:</strong></p>
<p>""""It is the best solution for take-away coffee, it maintains the organoleptic properties of coffee much better than the disposable cups used up to now. It is a real innovation that marks a turning point towards higher quality.""</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>High quality material, BPA Free</h3>
<p>It's made in Tritan: a latest generation polymer used for food containers at high temperatures. Completely safe, Bpa Free, it is also used for baby bottles.</p>
<p>Its characteristics give it a very resistant ceramic-like effect.</p>
<p>Dishwasher safe.</p>

<p><br/>To do this, I constantly update and follow courses with the best coffee professionals in Italy.<br/>From my years of  experience came the idea of Espresso Away.</p>
<p><br/>I immediately received support from several coffee professionals in Italy, enthusiastic about this product which marks an evolution in the take-away or office espresso coffee experience.</p>
<p>To make it, I followed the suggestion of the best experts and of tradition: the perfect espresso cup must have simple but fundamental characteristics. Inspired by study and tradition, I created Espresso Away.</p>

<p>Use Espresso Away at the coffee shop or office.</p>

We designed this for you: the First Reusable Espresso Cup for Take Away. Your best Espresso always with you.

The cup is part of the tasting experience
Drinking a good  Espresso coffee is an experience that starts from the bean to the cup. Normal take-away cups don't value your espresso coffee.
Espresso Away with its shape and texture makes you feel like drinking coffee as in the cup at an italian coffee shop.
It is reusable over and over again.

 
Designed to enhance the aromas of coffee

Size of the classic italian espresso cup, 2 oz.
 Truncated-conical shape, which allows a better formation and permanence of the cream over time, favoring the best perception of aromas.
The internal base must follow the classic ""egg"" shape to prevent the cream from breaking and to preserve its compactness and color for longer.
The most suitable color for the inside of the cup is bright and glossy white because it facilitates the evaluation of the espresso and, thanks to the strong color contrast, enhances the warm and inviting color of the espresso cream.
 The cap with thread guarantees a hermetic seal against spill and can thus be placed in a pocket or bag.
Keeps heat 3 times longer than disposable cups.


Respect for the Environment
Espresso Away is reusable and helps reduce the use of disposable cups. Around the world 50 billion are thrown away every year. Most end up in the environment and in the sea. Take part in the movement to reduce disposable cups, every gesture is important.

 
Always carry it with you
You can also use Espresso Away at home to make yourself an espresso before going out.Or you can use it in the office instead of disposable cups.Its airtight cap also serves not to dirty after use, you can put it in your pocket or leave it on your desk.
So you can easily clean it with water whenever you want.

Approved by professional barista
Giacomo lo Cascio, Italian coffee cup tasting champion, World cup finalist and professional barista:
""""It is the best solution for take-away coffee, it maintains the organoleptic properties of coffee much better than the disposable cups used up to now. It is a real innovation that marks a turning point towards higher quality.""
 
High quality material, BPA Free
It's made in Tritan: a latest generation polymer used for food containers at high temperatures. Completely safe, Bpa Free, it is also used for baby bottles.
Its characteristics give it a very resistant ceramic-like effect.
Dishwasher safe.

<p>Maehem Spirits started as a passion for craft cocktails and home brewing... we saw the popularity of the craft beer scene in Port Alberni, and realized it was time for a distillery.

There are a lot of elements to our vision and we'll be looking for ways to stay under budget and support local, renewable sources as much as possible.
Here's a breakdown of costs and necessary equipment we'll need:

$25 per set for cocktail glasses/bar ware
$50-100 each for bar stools
$100-150 each for vintage chairs
$250-500 each for live edge tables
$1000 for lighting
$2000 for the bar
$2500 for bathrooms
$1500 for neon signs
$10,000 for a living wall installation where we hope to grow some of our garnishes for cocktails!

Every contribution to our campaign helps us get our lounge ready to welcome you!
 

 
Some perks we're especially excited to share with you are:

Spirit tasting & distillery tour
Online/in-person mixology classes: to help you learn how to make amazing cocktails and craft your own!
Fun, catered bottling party: where you can be a part of the Maehem Spirits production process and ask us as many questions as you like!
Access to our Founders Club: where you'll get frequent mixology classes, access to early releases and discounts and get your name on our Founders Club Board or on our Copper Still!
Unique, limited edition merchandise that nobody else will have access to!

 
We will use all the funds raised towards designing and renovating our lounge area, throughout the campaign we'll be updating you on our progress, and asking your help on key choices like glassware... by being part of our campaign you'll also get to help us design it!
 

Craft beer isn't just beer... and craft spirits aren't just spirits. 
Like all good things, when it's hand crafted by passionate people who care more about creating a great product than the bottom line, the results speak for themselves. 
But craft spirits aren't just for making great cocktails... they bring people together.
After a year where staying apart is necessary, we want to help people feel that sense of community and togetherness whether it's through virtual happy hours or a nice night out with your bubble.
 
If you live in Port Alberni you've probably been to an event that one of us has organized or volunteered at already so you know we love to make sure others are having a good time!
 
 

As with all best laid plans... things might go wrong!
Some of the problems we might run into are:

chairs being hard to find or in bad condition requiring more costly restoration
issues constructing the living wall
difficulty sourcing elements requiring design changes

And as with all best laid plans... we have back up plans.
Which include:

sourcing vintage style chairs from online retailers, if we can't find them locally
working with our construction team and local plant nurseries, to make sure the living wall can happen
sticking to our theme, so that even if we have to change the design a little the vibe will remain the same


We know money isn't everything and there are so many ways you can help us with our campaign!

<h3>The Matrix Shower Screen - what is it and how does it work?</h3>
<p>This is a patented professional tool for espresso lovers with an E61 compatible group and can be installed in several seconds. </p>
<p>The shower is very different than your usual etched or holed espresso shower.  Made of porous stainless steel (99.7% uniform), the shower is compiled of tens of thousands of channels as small as 4-5μ. This technology acts as a pressure damper (similar to a Gicleur) at the absolute last point in the system before the water meets the coffee puck. </p>
<p>Why is this better than other screens?</p>
<p>- No more channeling! The matrix material structure ensures a uniform flow which lowers the risk of channeling, even when the barista is messing up the tamping. </p>
<p>- No more dirty groups! Well, that's a big claim and not entirely true. What happens is that since the channels in the material are much much smaller than any of the coffee grounds, none travel back up the 3/2 valve. However, oily molecules can still travel back with the water being chucked at the end of the action. So it will get dirty, but to an amount that a flush with some cleaning material at the end of the day will be more than enough to keep the group spotless. </p>
<p>- Get more out of less - Improving the flow ontop of the coffee allows the barista to grind the coffee finer and use less of it to reach a similar result. </p>
<p>- Thicker cremier espresso - the micro-bubbles created inside the tiny crevices of the material make their way into the coffee brew. With the fats and fibers, this micro-bubbles build a thicker crema and full body feel.</p>
<p>- No more - ""excuse me, i ordered an espresso but i think you served me a brown hot lemon juice"" - the acidity of the drink drops significanty compared to other screens. It is the immidiately noticeable. This means you can roast your coffee even lighter for more flowery-fruity notes, while being able to compensate for the aggressive acidity a light roast can cause.  <br/>BTW, there's a good chance you will not like your coffee's taste with the matrix screen. You'll probably have to tinker with the grind, amount and brewing profile. Maybe even change the roast. And maybe, even with all of that, you'd prefer the older more acidic version of your coffee.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>So what are you buying?</h3>
<p>The matrix shower was tested and developed using a KVDW speedster, SR opera, Lelit bianca and a banged-up old Grimac. That was Alpha testing and took place over 6 months.</p>
<p>The 100 units being sold are basically a Beta version and you will be my Beta tester. I'd appreciate your private or public feedback (though i'd appreciate a heads-up before posting anything). <br/>All the units are tested and function as intended, yet once the final product gets to production, you'll receive a replacement to the Beta unit. The main difference will have to do with the bonding.<br/>If you're asking yourself - why am i selling Beta versions instead of simply distributing 100 units? Well producing and shipping 100 units is a few thousand euros which i can't afford and also I've realized that people that have something in stake (even if it's just 25euro) will have more interest and input that someone that got a free gizmo to try. No? don't you think?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The production will be done in September with the support of the good people of IMS filters. </p>
