The surface of these planets is covered entirely with water. Our hero Ploppy lives on one of these planets. Ploppy is a friendly and a somewhat clumsy little creature. And ever since he was little he dreamt about traveling to other planets. When he was a child there was a story that changed his life and gave him 3 new friends. This was his birthday and his present was a ROCKET that he dreamed so long about. Ofcourse he ran straightaway outside and tried to launch it. He managed it on his first try. He controlled the rocket as if he were an ace and he had been controlling rockets all his life. While playing, Ploppy noticed an underwater butterfly. Like any teenager, he was a bit of a hooligan and he tried to scare the butterfly. A slight touch of the remote control and the rocket flew after the butterfly, shooting out bubbles from its engines, Ploppy in close pursuit. Suddenly Ploppy tripped and the remote control flew from his hands. The out of control rocket plummeted into a crevasse that was near Ploppy’s house and disappeared in the murky depths.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When he understood what happened Ploppy was very sad and he started to cry. His cries attracted the attention of three unusual inhabitants of this place - 3 bubbles appeared from a crevice below. They were no ordinary bubbles. They had eyes, they could attach themselves to objects using their special hands that looked like vortexes. Once they understood what had happened, the bubbles disappeared for a moment and soon brought the toy back to Ploppy. Ever since Ploppy and his 3 new friends were inseperable. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/629850/files/20140606024826-Frame10.jpg?1402048106"" src="""" style=""width: 50%; cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">They went to school together, then to college and became profound specialists in rocket building.

They were in deep space whizzing by other planets when suddenly an asteroid hit their rocket causing a gaping gash in the fuel tank. Fuel, that resembles bundles of energy spheres, started leaking out at an alarming rate. They were forced to land immediately on one of the planets. Fixing the hole was not a problem, but where could they get the fuel to bring them back home? Ploppy noticed a small bubble with some fuel not far away. And here the game begins. Each level will have the main hero and his 3 friends. Using the bubbles the player will have to collect the fuel and deliver it to Ploppy. Each level box will contain 25 levels. After Ploppy and his friends collect all the fuel, they climb into the rocket and fly to another planet. The main goal of the game is to bring Ploppy home.</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">To finish the game we dont need that much</p><ul>

<p>I’m Muerte, a shitty excuse of a TF2 player. </p>
<p>I had this bright idea of doing a rather…large…uncrating spree…1000 crates (500 Robo, 500 ‘normal’) to be exact, which will of course be livestreamed. </p>
<p>Yeah, some of you might be thinking ‘Right, this guy is pretty fucking stupid for wasting all that money on a video game’.  The majority of the money invested in this incredibly stupid uncrate spree is ‘profit’ from trading TF2 items over a substantial period of time.  I considered simply cashing out but thought, ‘Why not have a little bit of fun?’</p>
<p>Now, I done some ridiculously hard mathematical calculations using Pythagoras and some other fancy shit and figured out that uncrating 1000 crates would take just over 4 hours (assuming the average time for each uncrate is 15 seconds; 7 seconds to navigate to each key, hit use, navigate to the crate, hit uncrate; 5 seconds for the uncrating animation/annoying as fuck noise; 3 seconds to admire the inevitable strange I obtain from the uncrate and click ok).  For this reason, alongside downright laziness in attempting to obtain the remaining keys required, I am splitting this uncrate spree into 2 segments of 500 crates.  The first half will occur sometime this weekend, most likely on Saturday (20/07/2013) at around 2pm GMT (Yeah, that’s London time) – I will keep this post updated with the time I intend to begin uncrating.  The second half?  Well, probably in a few weeks or so…who knows.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Raffle/Donations</strong></em></p>
<p>I have decided to do a raffle too.  The first unusual I uncrate (if I even get one…you better give me one Valve -___-), no matter what it is (yes, even if it is a Burning Team Captain) will be the item which gets raffled.</p>
<p>A $5 donation will give you 1 entry into the raffle, $10 will give you 3 entries and $20 will give you 7.  If, for example, you choose to donate $50, you will receive 17 (7 + 7 + 3) entries into the raffle.</p>
<p>The raffle will close at whatever time I finish uncrating. </p>
<p><strong>Please ensure you put your Steam ID (in whatever format) when you donate.  This is done after payment has been sent.  A page will appear with the option to 'Leave a message for Mohsin Ahmed (me)'.  Enter your Steam ID there and tick 'Make Private'.  </strong>Failure to provide your Steam ID will simply make your donation anonymous and make it impossible to actually add you to the raffle.  Entries made AFTER the raffle has occurred will be considered donations (with obviously no actual entry into the raffle…since it’s already happened…).  The Indiegogo page will be up until Monday (22/07/2013).  The target has been set at $500, which is the minimum Indigogo will allow.  I seriously have no idea how much interest there will be, if any at all. </p>

<p>The history of our project is rather simple. Back in 2008, several future members of our team - and at that time, old fans of the Command and Conquer games - were very unhappy with the recently released Red Alert 3, which they felt had buried a good game series. Together, these disgruntled fans started developing a mod called <a href=""http://www.moddb.com/mods/red-alter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title='""Red Alter""'>""Red Alter""</a> for Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, which they hoped would demonstrate their ideas about the ""right"" Red Alert. We began with a fairly high level of quality and started to create our own universe for the project. A few years later, during the development of the mod, many members of our team had managed to accumulate a lot of experience and work as freelancers on a variety of small projects (many of which have not yet been announced). We realized that it was time to do something with our modification. The potential of our original universe was worthy of implementation on a separate engine and at an entirely new level.</p>
<p>In June 2012 our team decided to restart the project under a new name and develop a new, high quality indie game. At the same time we were joined by several experienced freelancers. So it was that Red Alter came to an end, but in it's place and with renewed vigour, Red March was born.</p>
<p>We named our team Bayonet Studio, and our motto is - ""By gamers - for gamers!"". This represents not only our attitude to Red March, but to games in general.</p>
<p><img alt=""What is Red March?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i45.tinypic.com/o02dg7.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""What is Red March?""/></p>
<p>Red March is at it's heart an RTS, based on the legacy of the old-school strategy games such as Command and Conquer. But this is not just the clone of some old game! Red March intends to reconcile the old-fashioned gameplay with features of newer generation games, for example dynamic infantry cover. Micro-control of units will not be as important as the player's overall strategic plan and making the right decisions. In Red March, you will have to rely on your intelligence to overcome hordes of enemy units.</p>
<p><img alt=""Wolverine 2 tank"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i47.tinypic.com/2eyje5c.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Wolverine 2 tank""/></p>
<p>We feel that RTS developers have been playing around with the multiplayer part of their games too much in recent years at the expense of single-player and the over-all atmosphere of the game. Our team wants to to avoid this this, and focus on a story that will plunge the player into the universe of Red March. This will be achieved by FMV with live actors playing different characters. But we aren't forgetting multiplayer, as we intend to launch with a well constructed multiplayer mode, and following launch, we will closely monitor balance of units and release patches that address any issues with this balance.</p>
<p><img alt=""The Red March universe"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i49.tinypic.com/2ic5do3.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Red March universe""/></p>
<p>The story of Red March is the the climax of the entirety of human conflicts - The Last World War. It was prepared for throughout the whole Cold War, and now, the war to end humanity has finally come true. Military technology has reached its goal - it has placed into the hands of mankind the most deadly arsenal in history. Weapons of mass destruction are brought on full alert and actively used, taking with them countless lives. Millions of soldiers have been sacrificed on the battlefields in futile attempts to turn the tide of the war. Every kilometer of land is stained with blood and paid for by the lives of soldiers. This monstrous meat-grinder extends across the entire globe. In these dark times, heroism and recklessness are synonymous, and human life is worth nothing, even though war is being waged in the name of people. War rages in the blood of humanity, and after this, the final war, the winners will not be left with a happy ending, only survivors. This is the atmosphere which we will instil into the project.</p>
<p>Communists, Capitalists, and a mysterious third side all vie to kill each other in the quest for world domination. Whose side are you on?</p>
<p><img alt=""Soviet Spacemarine"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i49.tinypic.com/zlsr5c.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Soviet Spacemarine""/></p>
<p>Unlike most RTS games involving the participation of the Soviet Union, we do not want to turn the USSR into the clown-like characters, the classic bad guys. Our style is extremely grim and serious, with no room for satire. In Red March, no side will be the ""Good guys"".</p>
<p>Of course, while we can not disclose details of the plot and script, we want to assure you that it will fully comply with the spirit of our game. In this universe there is no place to charity, there is only ruthless brutality, survival and endless war. In creating the universe of Red March, we were inspired by the darkest sci-fi settings in order to create a truly living world.</p>
<p>In style and design, Red March will be a mix of many areas, ranging from dieselpunk and atompunk, to the influence of the style of the 60s.</p>
<p><img alt=""Feedback"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i46.tinypic.com/5l6nas.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Feedback""/></p>
<p>We guarantee to pay heed to and provide a constant medium for feedback from fans and investors after collecting funding. Each month, on our blog and on our website, (which at the time of writing is still being completed) we will post reports (possibly with video) on what work we have done and we'll continue to discuss our plans. Hence we will be constantly talking about the course of our development from the outset, and backers will be able to see what their money is actually going to do.</p>
<p><img alt=""Release of the game"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/2w676g6.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Release of the game""/></p>
<p>According to our current plans, the game will be released in the form of electronic copies and distributed through Steam (if we are approved by potential buyers in the Steam Greenlight or make an agreement with Valve). But even if for some reason we will not be able to sell the game through Steam, we will be selling Red March through our own website. In addition, our backers will have the opportunity to get a boxed collector's version of the game stored on disk and several additional materials.</p>
<p>We are also considering a freeware-version of the game with a multiplayer game and some removed content. This is our response to piracy, as we realise that our game will most likely be broken and laid on torrent websites, but we look forward to maintaining a good relationship with the players. If a player is interested in our game, they can try the game in the freeware-version, and then purchase the full version of the game if they enjoy it.</p>
<p>Our initial task is to make a russian and english version of the game at first. If we'll be funded succesfully, we'll translate Red March on other languages.</p>
<p>In addition, if a publisher was interested in publishing our game in this format, we will consider proposals. However, we are focused primarily on digital distribution, and on the boxed collectors edition of the game.</p>
<p>Now our key platform is PC, Windows only. Porting on other OS's or platforms depends on success of your funding.</p>
<p><img alt=""What will we do with your funding?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/2zspuue.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""What will we do with your funding?""/></p>
<p>Most of the money will go, of course, on salaries and the hiring of additional workers, such as programmers since our current team is not yet large enough to develop this project from scratch. The current team consists mainly of residents of post-Soviet space, and there are many reasons why game development in Russia is much cheaper than in Western countries. This fact allows for a great saving on budget, as in the U.S, development of such a game would cost two or three times our asking price (not to mention spending that would go on marketing).</p>
<p>Unlike large publishers and developers, we do not intend to spend a great deal on marketing and advertising of the game, as we hope instead that the support of fans and their enthusiasm will spread the word of our game. As such, we will focus almost the entirety of the budget on the development of the game.</p>
<p>The engine for our game is currently not selected, but we have a short list of candidates. The final decision in choosing the engine will have to depend on the amount of money collected in this campaign.</p>
<p>However, we are prepared that in the event we collect more than the required minimum amount ($ 350,000), then we are ready to do the following:</p>
<p><strong>$ 450,000</strong> - We will be able to Improve the visuals of the game - better graphics and special effects, and therefore a better overall quality of the game. There can also be an expanded game world, and we will add more terrain and theatres of war. We will also be able to add more neutral objects to maps, and so the game world as a whole would become more detailed.</p>
<p><strong>$ 600,000</strong> - We will be able to release an SDK for modding. We respect both fans and developers who are trying to make their games available for modifying and allowing their own fans to create game content. So why can we not just release the SDK and the game? The fact is that since we are not creating our own engine, and are buying the license for it, therefore the tools of the engine will only be available to us under the contract. We therefore would have to create separate tools for our fans to be able to modify the resources of Red March. In addition, an SDK created for fans needs to be much more convenient and simple than the specialised tools used by developers.</p>
<p>Further funding would allow us to consider additional developments such as additional destructible scenery elements and more detailed physics, better in-game cinematics, development for Mac and Linux platforms, further campaigns and faction add-ons, in addition to a host of other improvements.</p>
<p><img alt=""How can you help?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i47.tinypic.com/29fyotz.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""How can you help?""/></p>
<p>Obviously, giving us even just a couple of dollars will help, and donating more will qualify you for certain rewards (See the rewards section below) In addition to investing money, you can greatly help our project by spreading information about it. Please tell your friends about us and our campaign.</p>
<p><img alt=""Why crowd funding and Indiegogo?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/2nuhl2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Why crowd funding and Indiegogo?""/></p>
<p>As you already know, the world is a very difficult economic situation and many publishers of video games have had problems with their finances. To avoid risk, the norm recently has been to create games in a more traditional form for mainstream gamers. Red March is not the same, and is not created for the mass of players; Instead, our target audience is players who enjoy old-school titles. Publishers of video games would not give us much money for our development, and if they did, would most likely interfere with our concept, to simplify the game for mainstream players and customers. Therefore, we chose сrowd funding as the source of funds for our development.</p>
<p>Initially, we thought we would put our project on Kickstarter, but there are many problems associated with the placement of projects from outside the USA. Indiegogo, however, is much more accessible and easier to use for young teams outside the USA, and that was the basis for our decision to place the campaign here.</p>

Now our key platform is PC, Windows only. Porting on other OS's or platforms depends on success of your funding.

Most of the money will go, of course, on salaries and the hiring of additional workers, such as programmers since our current team is not yet large enough to develop this project from scratch. The current team consists mainly of residents of post-Soviet space, and there are many reasons why game development in Russia is much cheaper than in Western countries. This fact allows for a great saving on budget, as in the U.S, development of such a game would cost two or three times our asking price (not to mention spending that would go on marketing).
Unlike large publishers and developers, we do not intend to spend a great deal on marketing and advertising of the game, as we hope instead that the support of fans and their enthusiasm will spread the word of our game. As such, we will focus almost the entirety of the budget on the development of the game.
The engine for our game is currently not selected, but we have a short list of candidates. The final decision in choosing the engine will have to depend on the amount of money collected in this campaign.
However, we are prepared that in the event we collect more than the required minimum amount ($ 350,000), then we are ready to do the following:
$ 450,000 - We will be able to Improve the visuals of the game - better graphics and special effects, and therefore a better overall quality of the game. There can also be an expanded game world, and we will add more terrain and theatres of war. We will also be able to add more neutral objects to maps, and so the game world as a whole would become more detailed.
$ 600,000 - We will be able to release an SDK for modding. We respect both fans and developers who are trying to make their games available for modifying and allowing their own fans to create game content. So why can we not just release the SDK and the game? The fact is that since we are not creating our own engine, and are buying the license for it, therefore the tools of the engine will only be available to us under the contract. We therefore would have to create separate tools for our fans to be able to modify the resources of Red March. In addition, an SDK created for fans needs to be much more convenient and simple than the specialised tools used by developers.
Further funding would allow us to consider additional developments such as additional destructible scenery elements and more detailed physics, better in-game cinematics, development for Mac and Linux platforms, further campaigns and faction add-ons, in addition to a host of other improvements.

Obviously, giving us even just a couple of dollars will help, and donating more will qualify you for certain rewards (See the rewards section below) In addition to investing money, you can greatly help our project by spreading information about it. Please tell your friends about us and our campaign.

As you already know, the world is a very difficult economic situation and many publishers of video games have had problems with their finances. To avoid risk, the norm recently has been to create games in a more traditional form for mainstream gamers. Red March is not the same, and is not created for the mass of players; Instead, our target audience is players who enjoy old-school titles. Publishers of video games would not give us much money for our development, and if they did, would most likely interfere with our concept, to simplify the game for mainstream players and customers. Therefore, we chose сrowd funding as the source of funds for our development.
Initially, we thought we would put our project on Kickstarter, but there are many problems associated with the placement of projects from outside the USA. Indiegogo, however, is much more accessible and easier to use for young teams outside the USA, and that was the basis for our decision to place the campaign here.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>About Pyromancy</b></p>
<p>Pyromancy Studios is a new gaming studio
start-up that was created with one purpose in mind: to create games that do not
adhere to the main-stream gaming trends and instead inspire our players to
imagine new possibilities in our games.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“You
can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of
conversation.” Plato</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“Humanity
has advanced, when it has advanced, not because it has been sober, responsible,
and cautious, but because it has been playful, rebellious, and immature.” Tom
Robbins</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“We
are never more fully alive, more completely ourselves, or more deeply engrossed in anything, than when we are at play.” Charles
Schaefer</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“Combinatory play seems to be the essential
feature in productive thought.” Albert Einstein</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9810.Albert_Einstein"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<p>Pyromancy plans to create games
that immerse the player into worlds where they invest their time and create
legacies that hold meaning to the world around them, where all their actions
will have positive and negative consequences, and where players are encouraged
to explore their choices with the knowledge that they will be responsible for
the outcome.</p>
<p><b>Chosen</b><b> of Blood</b></p>
<p>Our first game is inspired by the
classic games of the Dungeon Keeper series. However we want to deviate from the
typical approach that other remakes have taken in making the game more or less
age appropriate for everyone. Our game will be both a gritty and gruesome MMO
RTS with heavy RPG elements that will cater to players looking to feel
nefarious glee through taking the mantle of a barely human creature known as a
Blood Lord.</p>
<p>As a Blood Lord the player will be
in command of powerful blood magic that needs one thing to cast - blood. As a
Blood Lord your own personal supply is very limited so you will need to find
humans who will supply you with this much-needed blood to ensure you acquire
and keep your rightful place among the other Blood Lords who also desire the
same sources of power and are willing to plot and conspire against you to keep
you from your rightful place.</p>
<p>The game will be limited
free-to-play with a premium store for perk items that can be purchased with
established forms of currency. With our game being for a more adult audience we
will keep the things in the game and the store that are less appropriate for
children being unlockable and accessible only though official Pyromancy Studio
memberships. These memberships will used to ensure that there are fewer
opportunities for lawsuits and to help preserve the purity of children from
content that probably won’t meet with parental approval.</p>
<p><b>Features</b></p>
<p><span>1.<span> 
</span></span>Lair and Dungeon Building</p>
<p>One of the foundational features to Chosen of Blood is that
the player gets to build and rebuild to their heart’s content. The player’s
home will be divided into two areas:</p>
<p>  The upper
floor will be the Lair and will consist of all the living and working space for
the player, their minions and the player’s slaves.</p>
<p>Downstairs is the Dungeon, where all prisoners are thrown
when they are captured and held until they have either outlived or expanded
their usefulness.</p>
<p>Rooms and hallways may be built into these two floors,
which, because the lair is deep underground, will need a space carved from the
stone first, and then fixtures which will serve as both decorative and
functional in purpose. From every skull that adorns the walls to the marble
tiles there will be positive and/or negative effects attached that will impact
anyone who enters the home that the player builds.</p>
<p><span>2.<span> 
</span></span>Prisoner Management</p>
<p>Prisoners will be kept in the dungeon in holding fixtures
that will contain one or more prisoner at a time. The usefulness of having
prisoners is that they can be tortured and questioned for information and
eventually can be bound into service as one of your minions. Alternately they
can simply be executed for their blood, the most valuable and powerful thing a
mortal possesses but never fully grasps.</p>
<p>Eventually players will want to take the time to
sufficiently tame these prisoners without breaking them, then they can be used
either as slaves to work in the Lair and Dungeon, or the player can release
them to serve as heralds or spies, one to spread information/lies and the other
to collect and deliver information back to the player.</p>
<p><span>3.<span> 
</span></span>Minion Management</p>
<p>Minions are the twisted combat related servants of the
player. In Chosen of Blood we will be replacing the classic leveling system
used in pretty much every RPG available on the market with a system that works
on a combination of gear-based and skill-based systems that will determine the
role and the effectiveness of a player’s army.</p>
<p>Minions will have equipment slots for each and every
purpose, but their function and effectiveness will be determined based on the
type and quality of the gear that the player chooses to use. If the player
wants to train his minion in the ways of melee combat then equipping a sword
will do the trick. If the player wants that same minion to cast curative spells
then putting a magical wand in the off-hand and equipping a healing spell tome
will do just that. The trade off of versatility is that a versatile minion will
lack the single function effectiveness that they would get if it were built for
only one purpose.</p>
<p>We want our players to experiment and find what gear
mixtures work best for them, players can be as ingenious in their play styles
as they like. Pyromancy Studios approves of this pursuit and wants to publicly
support creative game playing in Chosen of Blood and all our future games.</p>
<p><span>4.<span> 
</span></span>Crafting and Enchanting</p>
<p>Players will have the ability to craft some basic items at
the beginning of the game that can be used to build their armies and their lair
and dungeon. But eventually players will want to trap skilled craftsmen from the
surface and tame them into slaves that can be put to use. Blacksmiths, once
tamed and bound into slavery, will then put their skills to use unlocking a
variety of craftable armors and weapons that they alone can make. As more
craftsmen are found, tamed, and finally bound into slavery there will be
further crafting recipes unlocked.</p>
<p>Crafting recipes will cover everything from minion and
player gear to fixtures, even certain types of rooms will require specific
craftsmen to create. Also each recipe will require specified amounts of
materials, but the final product will be determined by the choice of materials
used and the quality of those materials used.</p>
<p><span>a.<span> 
</span></span>Materials</p>
<p>There will be various materials that will be categorical and
sub-categorically divided. The main categories will be: Metals, Hides, Cloth,
Stone/Minerals, Bone, Wood, and Dyes.</p>
<p>For a few examples Metals will include Iron and Copper; and
Hides will include Deer Pelt and Cow Hide; and Wood will include Oak and Yew.</p>
<p><span>b.<span> 
</span></span>Qualities</p>
<p>Materials will be stored in large piles in the storerooms
built into the Lair, and the overall quality of those piles will be the average
of the qualities of the materials in the pile as they are added.</p>
<p>Items that are not needed can also be converted into salvage,
but when items are salvaged for their materials there will be an initial loss
in quality of the materials. Fortunately, with the right specialist craftsman
any and all materials will be able to be purified in quality, but at an
increasing cost based on the number of items being purified and the current
quality. Item quality cannot be improved once crafted, so players will want to
use the purest quality materials at their disposal when crafting for the best
results.</p>
<p><span>c.<span> 
</span></span>Enchanting</p>
<p>All items will be able to be enchanted with a single special
effect. This effect might be an added fire damage bonus, a defense to fire
damage, a bonus to HP or a bonus to melee damage.</p>
<p>All enchantments will be blood magic based and will need
blood to apply the enchantment. These enchantments can be increased to an
unlimited degree but the cost to do so will rise with that increase at an
exponential rate that will quickly make the cost itself a hindrance to any
further enchanting.</p>
<p>Furthermore, enchantments will be item bound and will not be
able to be salvaged along with item materials, so players will want to be
selective and not waste blood on vast amounts on enchanting garbage equipment.</p>
<p><span>5.<span> 
</span></span>Skills and Magic</p>
<p><span>a.<span> 
</span></span>Player</p>
<p>All of the player’s skills and magic will be tied to the use
of blood magic, which will require the consumption of blood. Most of the skills
or spells will drain the blood of the player directly, but some will drain
blood from the target and replenish the blood of the player.</p>
<p>When defending his own home the player will be able to tap
directly into the blood pool and will cast his spells from that first, draining
himself only when he foolishly depletes his greater, non-vital supply. Whenever
anyplace else the only blood he will have access to will be his own blood and
the blood of creatures around him, should they have any blood of their own.</p>
<p><span>b.<span> 
</span></span>Minions and NPCs</p>
<p>Minions will be different from players in their use of magic
and skills. Spells will be tied to gear pieces called tomes and scrolls, and
will have a limited number of uses just like quivers of arrows will have
limited shots before the minion will be out of ammunition.</p>
<p>Skills will not have a limited number of uses, but will have
HP costs associated to them. However, there will be some situations where
players may find ways to circumvent these costs if the players are creative
enough to look for those.</p>
<p>Minions will gain their skills based on a set time using the
discipline into which that skill falls. There are also training fixtures for
the minion to practice their combat disciplines on, and if not in use they will
train themselves for a period of time before stopping to make room for another
minion to practice. Similarly, skills will be learned during actual combat, so
long as the skill is of the same discipline as the weapons they are using—learning
a melee skill can be done with a sword or an ax but not with a bow.</p>
<p><span>6.<span> 
</span></span>Areas and Dominions</p>
<p>Players will trap the humans of the surface world from
towns, estates and cities referred to in the game as areas, every gate and/or
trap portal that a player makes in their lair can only connect to one area at a
time. And while it will be possible, there is no practical reason to have more
than one gate or trap portal per area. On the surface these areas will be tied
together either by geographical similarity or through political provinces,
serving under the command of a surface King vying for political sway over the
other lords on the surface.</p>
<p><span>a.<span> 
</span></span>Areas</p>
<p>There will be four types of areas in the game: Towns,
Estates, Cities, and Wastelands. In the game any area that starts with or is
reduced to a population of zero will be rendered as wasteland. There are a
total of 3876 areas, but we plan on less than a third of those being populated
at the start of the game.</p>
<p>Towns will be rural countryside and while having a small population
they will be the key providers of food for the rest of the province. Strong and
prosperous towns will increase population growth rates and also material
abundance and quality across the whole rest of the province.</p>
<p>Estates are the seat of provincial nobility, here provincial
learning and safety increase with prosperity. When the provinces estates are
prosperous there are fewer bandits and more mages in the province, meaning
there is more coin and better enchanted gears can be found on higher tiered humans.</p>
<p>Cities are the main population centers and are tied directly
to the crafting prowess of a province. The more highly developed and prosperous
the Cities of an area are the more Craftsmen can be found in that province and
the better the quality of the gear that can be obtained from prisoners.</p>
<p>Just because an area is a wasteland does not mean that it is
useless to the players. Material harvest/gathering mission will result in
greater harvests because of the lack of human presence. And should a player decide
to invest into such an area they will have the options to send a sufficient
number of slaves on a settlement mission to create a new town that the player
can both name and hold dominion over from its inception.</p>
<p><span>b.<span> 
</span></span>Geological Regions (Geo-Regions)</p>
<p>The terrain of the surface world is varied and diverse, and
the crafting Materials that can be found will vary from terrain to terrain.
Areas in these various terrains have been assembled into similar terrains to
create the different Geo-Regions in the game. The assigned Geo-Region of an
area will be the dictating factor in what Materials can be harvested in that
area.</p>
<p><span>c.<span> 
</span></span>Provinces</p>
<p>Collections of neighboring areas will be banded together as a
Political Province. Provinces are political in
nature and might crossover between Geo-Regions, so the resources that will be
found in Provinces with the wealth to encourage trade might allow for players
to discover Materials in an Area that cannot be found in that area based on
it’s Geo-Region. Also certain special events in the future will be region
specified for those events.</p>
<p>At the game start there will be over 100 provinces, but over
time some might be destroyed or absorbed by other provinces, and in some rare
cases new provinces might spring up with player help.</p>
<p><span>d.<span> 
</span></span>Dominions</p>
<p>Players will have the opportunity to lay claim to an area and
hold it as a dominion, and while there is no limit to the number of Gates that
a player can build they can only hold up to 5 Domains at any one time. Once
owned they will receive tributes in the form of currency, blood sacrifices,
and/or local materials available in the Province. Players will also receive
missions and have management setting that can be used to prosper or oppress
their domain to their hearts content.</p>
<p>Every action that a player takes involving their domain will
not only impact their domain, but also the rest of the areas in the Province.
With each decision the player makes there will be an impact on Dominion
loyalty. Should the loyalty be high the area might start hunting Heroes who come
to town looking for the Blood Lord, or if loyalty drops too low there might be
a revolt or there will be an increase in heroes in that area looking to
liberate that area which is so sorely oppressed by the Heroes’ sworn
enemies—Blood Lords—our Players.</p>
<p>Lastly if a player’s domain is reduced to a wasteland then
the symbol of Dominion will be destroyed and the Dominion will no longer be
under control. This will apply to any area except for the specialty Exclusive
areas that we are offering only in this funding campaign.</p>
<p><span>7.<span> 
</span></span>Combat</p>
<p>All combat will managed on a RTS basis, in which both player
and NPC units will be actively attacking and advancing in real time. Player
Minions will operate under limited AI unless given a direct order from the
Player. All player orders will supersede any AI decision, and once the order is
completed the unit will revert to their AI behavioral logics. This is designed
so that if a player gets attacked while offline his minions will still defend
the lair, and for those players who do not like to micro-manage battles they
will not need to.</p>
<p><span>a.<span> 
</span></span>Player vrs. Environment</p>
<p>Players will lure and/or trap humans from the surface world
into their lairs where the player will either defeat the invaders, throwing
them into the dungeons below, or the player will be beaten and the humans will
liberate treasures and prisoners from the Lair and Dungeon.</p>
<p>After a player has grown sufficiently notorious, bands of
NPCs will begin to attack on their own volition, and the player will need to
ready to defend against anything that might come after them whether they are
online or offline. This will require suitably equipped minions, expertly placed
traps, and a carefully laid-out lair.</p>
<p>There will also be wandering parties of Heroes who will hunt
the Players that they have a fair chance of defeating. As these parties
successfully raid players’ lairs for treasure and fame, their strength and
numbers will grow until they are a large enough army to attempt liberating
entire provinces at a time. Defeating these heroic parties will be of vital
importance to players who will want to prevent massive heroic armies and also
because heroic units make the best minions.</p>
<p><span>b.<span> 
</span></span>Player vrs Player</p>
<p>Players will have the opportunity to invade the lairs of
other players so long as they know the name of player they are raiding and one
of the areas where the targeted player is living. The attacking player will
then be able to send in his minions to raid the target Lair, being able to
destroy the powerbase of the targeted Player, take treasure and or prisoners,
or even Dominions.</p>
<p>Players should beware, though, of a few things. To die in
another Lair means that their body is not absorbed into the resurrection ritual
and will remain in the defending player’s along with a portion of the attacking
player’s strength and the player’s gear, the body will need to be reclaimed
before the attacking player will be able to regain full strength. This can
either be done through force or through negotiating a ransom for the body.</p>
<p>Also attacking another player requires a sufficient number of
troops and the defender might have friends reinforcing him with their own
troops, or the defender’s friends might launch a counter attack on the
attacking player while he is occupied on his offensive.</p>
<p><span>c.<span> 
</span></span>The Abyss</p>
<p>The Abyss is the place that exists between dimensions; here
there are no laws of logic or reason and here monsters dwell that range from
the normal to the bizarre and from the harmless to dreadful. This dimension
will serve as an arena for players to hold arena events where players can enter
solo, with a group or can send their minions into events that are either solo
or grouped events. Events are either elimination or survival in nature and
prizes will be awarded based on performance in the events.</p>
<p>Since the laws of logic do not apply in the Abyss death does
not exist in the same form, so Blood Lords and their Minions need not fear
dying. While dying will end their participation in any of the events being held
there they will find that they are simply returned to the Insanity Gardens
which are used as the entry and peaceful gathering location in the Abyss.</p>
<p><span>8.<span> 
</span></span>Prestige</p>
<p>Prestige is the measure of renown that a player has
accumulated through their actions and will be the only listed ranking system in
the game.</p>
<p>Players will gain a small amount of prestige for every human
that they defeat and throw into their dungeons. The larger the party of humans
and the higher tier that the humans are the greater the gain will be for the
Player. For defeating parties of heroic humans there is an additional boost for
each human defeated and thrown into the dungeon.</p>
<p>Likewise prestige can only be lost through failure to
adequately protect your home or through failed attack attempts on other
players. The victor in player vrs player combat will gain a percentage of the
prestige that the defeated player loses, should the victor suffer no losses
then he will receive 100% of lost Prestige.</p>
<p>As player prestige rise so do the odds against that player.
Both NPC armies and other players will seek to topple and cast down the highly
prestigious player. At a certain point it will become possible for a player to
name their lair, and if he does not name the lair within a set time it will be
named for him. Once named the prestige gain will be reduced but the difficulty
of the humans that will attack the player will increase.</p>
<p>In the event that a highly prestigious player is defeated
the player or NPC human party leader will receive the title of “[player name]
Slayer”. These titles can be stacked indefinably and will add to the prestige
of a player or will add to the strength of the NPC who overthrew the highly
ranked player.</p>
<p>After being laid low again a player will be able to
resurrect some of their former troops and will be able to rebuild, but his lair
name will remain and his prestige gain will remain reduced, however the added
difficulty will remain proportionately harder for their current prestige than
it would be for a new player making the same climb.</p>
<p><span>9.<span> 
</span></span>Alliances</p>
<p>There will come a point in the game where every player will
find added benefits in making or joining an alliance. As a member of an
alliance, a player will have access to the assistance of their fellow members,
and will have access to additional challenges and benefits that can only be
found in an alliance.</p>
<p><span>a.<span> 
</span></span>Leadership</p>
<p>As an alliance, the leadership is rather democratic, where
the major decisions are made through vote, and the leverage of each player is
based on their prestige. So a player with enough prestige to cast over 50% of
the vote will be the de facto leader of the alliance.</p>
<p>Officers for the leadership council will be elected as well,
but for these elections each player will only receive one vote each. The number
of Officers in an alliance can be less but cannot be more than 20% of the total
members of the alliance. Officers will be responsible for the maintenance and
management of alliance resources, inventories, minions and dominions.</p>
<p><span>b.<span> 
</span></span>Alliance Hall</p>
<p>The Alliance Hall is built like individual player lairs,
except that it is the communal property of the alliance and will require active
player donations to craft, until the alliance is capable of taking hold of a
domain that will then provide tributes to the alliance that will cover the
construction and crafting needs.</p>
<p>Minion armies of the alliance will wander the Allaince hall
and be under the management of the alliance officers. During combat Minions
will follow their AI logic unless given orders from an officer, then the Minion
will follow the most recently received order and then return to following their
logic unless given another order. For this reason it is recommended that during
Alliance
battles that there should only be as many officers online as possible, giving
orders as coordinators. Minions that players bring in as personal
reinforcements will remain under the control of the player they belong to.</p>
<p>Inside the alliance hall players will be able to walk around,
trade items freely, engage in conversations and even duel without loss of life
energies or prestige, except during Alliance
battles where defeats and victories will be reflected in prestige losses and
gains.</p>
<p><span>c.<span> 
</span></span>Alliance
Rank</p>
<p>Alliances will be ranked on the total cumulative prestige of
all their members. A single strong player does not make a strong alliance by
himself even though he might enjoy simple decision making processes.</p>
<p><span>d.<span> 
</span></span>Alliance
Dominion</p>
<p>Alliances will be able to hold one or two dominions if they
have enough cumulative prestige, but unlike players who claim dominion over
individual areas alliances will claim dominion over an entire province. Or if
an alliance has enough population in areas that border each other then it is
potentially possible for them to sponsor a currently subjugated noble to be a
provincial leader over a new province that the alliance will hold dominion over
so long as they have the room to hold the dominion, to found a new province
without having the capacity to hold the domain will result in a new free
province.</p>
<p>Similarly, alliances with enough dominion leverage among
their members through provincially local areas can dispose of a provincial
leader and collapse a province into assimilation to another province, adding to
the wealth and resources of the province gaining the new areas.</p>
<p>If an alliance loses too much prestige and cannot maintain a
second dominion then it will be the domain with the greatest wealth that they
will lose and they will keep their less valuable domain.</p>
<p><b>Alpha Phase</b></p>
<p>During our Alpha development
portion we will be constructing the game one piece at a time and implementing
it onto our testing server. Our carefully selected testers will then take each
new addition and run it through a battery of trials, attempting to break the
new addition or discover ways in which the new additions causes issues with
previously implemented content.</p>
<p>During the last portion of the
Alpha phase, the game will receive its graphical skins, the lighting effects
for the sake of game mood, and other more cosmetic game parts will go into
development. Once the mechanics of the game have been finished and all that
needs added are the virtual cosmetics we will be open to letting our
contributors who have purchased the pre-beta access join into the game and
begin exploring the game and building their lairs and dungeons while we
finalize and confirm the stability of the game and the addition of the premium
shop as a working portion of both the game and the Pyromancy website.</p>
<p><b>Beta Phase</b></p>
<p>After the game is deemed completely
stable and the game the premium store can differentiate between members and
non-members, the game will be rolled over into Beta development phase.</p>
<p>During this phase the game will
become completely available to play and open to the public, with working
memberships and premium store items. Our development focus during this phase
will be to increase the content of the game and the premium store to include
all the items and choices that we have in store for the game.</p>
<p>Upon the completion of our various
content lists and without discovering any game mechanics related issues the
game will officially released and all the players and people who supported our
development will be given credit for the assistance that they gave to us. And
we will begin working on one or more of the other game projects that we have
already have intent to develop.</p>
<p><b>Our Needs</b></p>
<p>As a new start-up game studio Pyromancy
needs funding to not only cover our basic development costs for our game engine
and servers, but also to cover our basic living expenditures so that we can
devote ourselves to working full-time on the programming and development of our
first game with the intent that if we work hard and get our first game done
right then it will pay our needs while we produce all our future game projects.</p>

About Pyromancy
Pyromancy Studios is a new gaming studio
start-up that was created with one purpose in mind: to create games that do not
adhere to the main-stream gaming trends and instead inspire our players to
imagine new possibilities in our games.
“You
can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of
conversation.” Plato
“Humanity
has advanced, when it has advanced, not because it has been sober, responsible,
and cautious, but because it has been playful, rebellious, and immature.” Tom
Robbins

“We
are never more fully alive, more completely ourselves, or more deeply engrossed in anything, than when we are at play.” Charles
Schaefer
“Combinatory play seems to be the essential
feature in productive thought.” Albert Einstein

Pyromancy plans to create games
that immerse the player into worlds where they invest their time and create
legacies that hold meaning to the world around them, where all their actions
will have positive and negative consequences, and where players are encouraged
to explore their choices with the knowledge that they will be responsible for
the outcome.
Chosen of Blood
Our first game is inspired by the
classic games of the Dungeon Keeper series. However we want to deviate from the
typical approach that other remakes have taken in making the game more or less
age appropriate for everyone. Our game will be both a gritty and gruesome MMO
RTS with heavy RPG elements that will cater to players looking to feel
nefarious glee through taking the mantle of a barely human creature known as a
Blood Lord.
As a Blood Lord the player will be
in command of powerful blood magic that needs one thing to cast - blood. As a
Blood Lord your own personal supply is very limited so you will need to find
humans who will supply you with this much-needed blood to ensure you acquire
and keep your rightful place among the other Blood Lords who also desire the
same sources of power and are willing to plot and conspire against you to keep
you from your rightful place.
The game will be limited
free-to-play with a premium store for perk items that can be purchased with
established forms of currency. With our game being for a more adult audience we
will keep the things in the game and the store that are less appropriate for
children being unlockable and accessible only though official Pyromancy Studio
memberships. These memberships will used to ensure that there are fewer
opportunities for lawsuits and to help preserve the purity of children from
content that probably won’t meet with parental approval.
Features
1. 
Lair and Dungeon Building
One of the foundational features to Chosen of Blood is that
the player gets to build and rebuild to their heart’s content. The player’s
home will be divided into two areas:
  The upper
floor will be the Lair and will consist of all the living and working space for
the player, their minions and the player’s slaves.
Downstairs is the Dungeon, where all prisoners are thrown
when they are captured and held until they have either outlived or expanded
their usefulness.
Rooms and hallways may be built into these two floors,
which, because the lair is deep underground, will need a space carved from the
stone first, and then fixtures which will serve as both decorative and
functional in purpose. From every skull that adorns the walls to the marble
tiles there will be positive and/or negative effects attached that will impact
anyone who enters the home that the player builds.
2. 
Prisoner Management
Prisoners will be kept in the dungeon in holding fixtures
that will contain one or more prisoner at a time. The usefulness of having
prisoners is that they can be tortured and questioned for information and
eventually can be bound into service as one of your minions. Alternately they
can simply be executed for their blood, the most valuable and powerful thing a
mortal possesses but never fully grasps.
Eventually players will want to take the time to
sufficiently tame these prisoners without breaking them, then they can be used
either as slaves to work in the Lair and Dungeon, or the player can release
them to serve as heralds or spies, one to spread information/lies and the other
to collect and deliver information back to the player.
3. 
Minion Management
Minions are the twisted combat related servants of the
player. In Chosen of Blood we will be replacing the classic leveling system
used in pretty much every RPG available on the market with a system that works
on a combination of gear-based and skill-based systems that will determine the
role and the effectiveness of a player’s army.
Minions will have equipment slots for each and every
purpose, but their function and effectiveness will be determined based on the
type and quality of the gear that the player chooses to use. If the player
wants to train his minion in the ways of melee combat then equipping a sword
will do the trick. If the player wants that same minion to cast curative spells
then putting a magical wand in the off-hand and equipping a healing spell tome
will do just that. The trade off of versatility is that a versatile minion will
lack the single function effectiveness that they would get if it were built for
only one purpose.
We want our players to experiment and find what gear
mixtures work best for them, players can be as ingenious in their play styles
as they like. Pyromancy Studios approves of this pursuit and wants to publicly
support creative game playing in Chosen of Blood and all our future games.
4. 
Crafting and Enchanting
Players will have the ability to craft some basic items at
the beginning of the game that can be used to build their armies and their lair
and dungeon. But eventually players will want to trap skilled craftsmen from the
surface and tame them into slaves that can be put to use. Blacksmiths, once
tamed and bound into slavery, will then put their skills to use unlocking a
variety of craftable armors and weapons that they alone can make. As more
craftsmen are found, tamed, and finally bound into slavery there will be
further crafting recipes unlocked.
Crafting recipes will cover everything from minion and
player gear to fixtures, even certain types of rooms will require specific
craftsmen to create. Also each recipe will require specified amounts of
materials, but the final product will be determined by the choice of materials
used and the quality of those materials used.
a. 
Materials
There will be various materials that will be categorical and
sub-categorically divided. The main categories will be: Metals, Hides, Cloth,
Stone/Minerals, Bone, Wood, and Dyes.
For a few examples Metals will include Iron and Copper; and
Hides will include Deer Pelt and Cow Hide; and Wood will include Oak and Yew.
b. 
Qualities
Materials will be stored in large piles in the storerooms
built into the Lair, and the overall quality of those piles will be the average
of the qualities of the materials in the pile as they are added.
Items that are not needed can also be converted into salvage,
but when items are salvaged for their materials there will be an initial loss
in quality of the materials. Fortunately, with the right specialist craftsman
any and all materials will be able to be purified in quality, but at an
increasing cost based on the number of items being purified and the current
quality. Item quality cannot be improved once crafted, so players will want to
use the purest quality materials at their disposal when crafting for the best
results.
c. 
Enchanting
All items will be able to be enchanted with a single special
effect. This effect might be an added fire damage bonus, a defense to fire
damage, a bonus to HP or a bonus to melee damage.
All enchantments will be blood magic based and will need
blood to apply the enchantment. These enchantments can be increased to an
unlimited degree but the cost to do so will rise with that increase at an
exponential rate that will quickly make the cost itself a hindrance to any
further enchanting.
Furthermore, enchantments will be item bound and will not be
able to be salvaged along with item materials, so players will want to be
selective and not waste blood on vast amounts on enchanting garbage equipment.
5. 
Skills and Magic
a. 
Player
All of the player’s skills and magic will be tied to the use
of blood magic, which will require the consumption of blood. Most of the skills
or spells will drain the blood of the player directly, but some will drain
blood from the target and replenish the blood of the player.
When defending his own home the player will be able to tap
directly into the blood pool and will cast his spells from that first, draining
himself only when he foolishly depletes his greater, non-vital supply. Whenever
anyplace else the only blood he will have access to will be his own blood and
the blood of creatures around him, should they have any blood of their own.
b. 
Minions and NPCs
Minions will be different from players in their use of magic
and skills. Spells will be tied to gear pieces called tomes and scrolls, and
will have a limited number of uses just like quivers of arrows will have
limited shots before the minion will be out of ammunition.
Skills will not have a limited number of uses, but will have
HP costs associated to them. However, there will be some situations where
players may find ways to circumvent these costs if the players are creative
enough to look for those.
Minions will gain their skills based on a set time using the
discipline into which that skill falls. There are also training fixtures for
the minion to practice their combat disciplines on, and if not in use they will
train themselves for a period of time before stopping to make room for another
minion to practice. Similarly, skills will be learned during actual combat, so
long as the skill is of the same discipline as the weapons they are using—learning
a melee skill can be done with a sword or an ax but not with a bow.
6. 
Areas and Dominions
Players will trap the humans of the surface world from
towns, estates and cities referred to in the game as areas, every gate and/or
trap portal that a player makes in their lair can only connect to one area at a
time. And while it will be possible, there is no practical reason to have more
than one gate or trap portal per area. On the surface these areas will be tied
together either by geographical similarity or through political provinces,
serving under the command of a surface King vying for political sway over the
other lords on the surface.
a. 
Areas
There will be four types of areas in the game: Towns,
Estates, Cities, and Wastelands. In the game any area that starts with or is
reduced to a population of zero will be rendered as wasteland. There are a
total of 3876 areas, but we plan on less than a third of those being populated
at the start of the game.
Towns will be rural countryside and while having a small population
they will be the key providers of food for the rest of the province. Strong and
prosperous towns will increase population growth rates and also material
abundance and quality across the whole rest of the province.
Estates are the seat of provincial nobility, here provincial
learning and safety increase with prosperity. When the provinces estates are
prosperous there are fewer bandits and more mages in the province, meaning
there is more coin and better enchanted gears can be found on higher tiered humans.
Cities are the main population centers and are tied directly
to the crafting prowess of a province. The more highly developed and prosperous
the Cities of an area are the more Craftsmen can be found in that province and
the better the quality of the gear that can be obtained from prisoners.
Just because an area is a wasteland does not mean that it is
useless to the players. Material harvest/gathering mission will result in
greater harvests because of the lack of human presence. And should a player decide
to invest into such an area they will have the options to send a sufficient
number of slaves on a settlement mission to create a new town that the player
can both name and hold dominion over from its inception.
b. 
Geological Regions (Geo-Regions)
The terrain of the surface world is varied and diverse, and
the crafting Materials that can be found will vary from terrain to terrain.
Areas in these various terrains have been assembled into similar terrains to
create the different Geo-Regions in the game. The assigned Geo-Region of an
area will be the dictating factor in what Materials can be harvested in that
area.
c. 
Provinces
Collections of neighboring areas will be banded together as a
Political Province. Provinces are political in
nature and might crossover between Geo-Regions, so the resources that will be
found in Provinces with the wealth to encourage trade might allow for players
to discover Materials in an Area that cannot be found in that area based on
it’s Geo-Region. Also certain special events in the future will be region
specified for those events.
At the game start there will be over 100 provinces, but over
time some might be destroyed or absorbed by other provinces, and in some rare
cases new provinces might spring up with player help.
d. 
Dominions
Players will have the opportunity to lay claim to an area and
hold it as a dominion, and while there is no limit to the number of Gates that
a player can build they can only hold up to 5 Domains at any one time. Once
owned they will receive tributes in the form of currency, blood sacrifices,
and/or local materials available in the Province. Players will also receive
missions and have management setting that can be used to prosper or oppress
their domain to their hearts content.
Every action that a player takes involving their domain will
not only impact their domain, but also the rest of the areas in the Province.
With each decision the player makes there will be an impact on Dominion
loyalty. Should the loyalty be high the area might start hunting Heroes who come
to town looking for the Blood Lord, or if loyalty drops too low there might be
a revolt or there will be an increase in heroes in that area looking to
liberate that area which is so sorely oppressed by the Heroes’ sworn
enemies—Blood Lords—our Players.
Lastly if a player’s domain is reduced to a wasteland then
the symbol of Dominion will be destroyed and the Dominion will no longer be
under control. This will apply to any area except for the specialty Exclusive
areas that we are offering only in this funding campaign.
7. 
Combat
All combat will managed on a RTS basis, in which both player
and NPC units will be actively attacking and advancing in real time. Player
Minions will operate under limited AI unless given a direct order from the
Player. All player orders will supersede any AI decision, and once the order is
completed the unit will revert to their AI behavioral logics. This is designed
so that if a player gets attacked while offline his minions will still defend
the lair, and for those players who do not like to micro-manage battles they
will not need to.
a. 
Player vrs. Environment
Players will lure and/or trap humans from the surface world
into their lairs where the player will either defeat the invaders, throwing
them into the dungeons below, or the player will be beaten and the humans will
liberate treasures and prisoners from the Lair and Dungeon.
After a player has grown sufficiently notorious, bands of
NPCs will begin to attack on their own volition, and the player will need to
ready to defend against anything that might come after them whether they are
online or offline. This will require suitably equipped minions, expertly placed
traps, and a carefully laid-out lair.
There will also be wandering parties of Heroes who will hunt
the Players that they have a fair chance of defeating. As these parties
successfully raid players’ lairs for treasure and fame, their strength and
numbers will grow until they are a large enough army to attempt liberating
entire provinces at a time. Defeating these heroic parties will be of vital
importance to players who will want to prevent massive heroic armies and also
because heroic units make the best minions.
b. 
Player vrs Player
Players will have the opportunity to invade the lairs of
other players so long as they know the name of player they are raiding and one
of the areas where the targeted player is living. The attacking player will
then be able to send in his minions to raid the target Lair, being able to
destroy the powerbase of the targeted Player, take treasure and or prisoners,
or even Dominions.
Players should beware, though, of a few things. To die in
another Lair means that their body is not absorbed into the resurrection ritual
and will remain in the defending player’s along with a portion of the attacking
player’s strength and the player’s gear, the body will need to be reclaimed
before the attacking player will be able to regain full strength. This can
either be done through force or through negotiating a ransom for the body.
Also attacking another player requires a sufficient number of
troops and the defender might have friends reinforcing him with their own
troops, or the defender’s friends might launch a counter attack on the
attacking player while he is occupied on his offensive.
c. 
The Abyss
The Abyss is the place that exists between dimensions; here
there are no laws of logic or reason and here monsters dwell that range from
the normal to the bizarre and from the harmless to dreadful. This dimension
will serve as an arena for players to hold arena events where players can enter
solo, with a group or can send their minions into events that are either solo
or grouped events. Events are either elimination or survival in nature and
prizes will be awarded based on performance in the events.
Since the laws of logic do not apply in the Abyss death does
not exist in the same form, so Blood Lords and their Minions need not fear
dying. While dying will end their participation in any of the events being held
there they will find that they are simply returned to the Insanity Gardens
which are used as the entry and peaceful gathering location in the Abyss.
8. 
Prestige
Prestige is the measure of renown that a player has
accumulated through their actions and will be the only listed ranking system in
the game.
Players will gain a small amount of prestige for every human
that they defeat and throw into their dungeons. The larger the party of humans
and the higher tier that the humans are the greater the gain will be for the
Player. For defeating parties of heroic humans there is an additional boost for
each human defeated and thrown into the dungeon.
Likewise prestige can only be lost through failure to
adequately protect your home or through failed attack attempts on other
players. The victor in player vrs player combat will gain a percentage of the
prestige that the defeated player loses, should the victor suffer no losses
then he will receive 100% of lost Prestige.
As player prestige rise so do the odds against that player.
Both NPC armies and other players will seek to topple and cast down the highly
prestigious player. At a certain point it will become possible for a player to
name their lair, and if he does not name the lair within a set time it will be
named for him. Once named the prestige gain will be reduced but the difficulty
of the humans that will attack the player will increase.
In the event that a highly prestigious player is defeated
the player or NPC human party leader will receive the title of “[player name]
Slayer”. These titles can be stacked indefinably and will add to the prestige
of a player or will add to the strength of the NPC who overthrew the highly
ranked player.
After being laid low again a player will be able to
resurrect some of their former troops and will be able to rebuild, but his lair
name will remain and his prestige gain will remain reduced, however the added
difficulty will remain proportionately harder for their current prestige than
it would be for a new player making the same climb.
9. 
Alliances
There will come a point in the game where every player will
find added benefits in making or joining an alliance. As a member of an
alliance, a player will have access to the assistance of their fellow members,
and will have access to additional challenges and benefits that can only be
found in an alliance.
a. 
Leadership
As an alliance, the leadership is rather democratic, where
the major decisions are made through vote, and the leverage of each player is
based on their prestige. So a player with enough prestige to cast over 50% of
the vote will be the de facto leader of the alliance.
Officers for the leadership council will be elected as well,
but for these elections each player will only receive one vote each. The number
of Officers in an alliance can be less but cannot be more than 20% of the total
members of the alliance. Officers will be responsible for the maintenance and
management of alliance resources, inventories, minions and dominions.
b. 
Alliance Hall
The Alliance Hall is built like individual player lairs,
except that it is the communal property of the alliance and will require active
player donations to craft, until the alliance is capable of taking hold of a
domain that will then provide tributes to the alliance that will cover the
construction and crafting needs.
Minion armies of the alliance will wander the Allaince hall
and be under the management of the alliance officers. During combat Minions
will follow their AI logic unless given orders from an officer, then the Minion
will follow the most recently received order and then return to following their
logic unless given another order. For this reason it is recommended that during
Alliance
battles that there should only be as many officers online as possible, giving
orders as coordinators. Minions that players bring in as personal
reinforcements will remain under the control of the player they belong to.
Inside the alliance hall players will be able to walk around,
trade items freely, engage in conversations and even duel without loss of life
energies or prestige, except during Alliance
battles where defeats and victories will be reflected in prestige losses and
gains.
c. 
Alliance
Rank
Alliances will be ranked on the total cumulative prestige of
all their members. A single strong player does not make a strong alliance by
himself even though he might enjoy simple decision making processes.
d. 
Alliance
Dominion
Alliances will be able to hold one or two dominions if they
have enough cumulative prestige, but unlike players who claim dominion over
individual areas alliances will claim dominion over an entire province. Or if
an alliance has enough population in areas that border each other then it is
potentially possible for them to sponsor a currently subjugated noble to be a
provincial leader over a new province that the alliance will hold dominion over
so long as they have the room to hold the dominion, to found a new province
without having the capacity to hold the domain will result in a new free
province.
Similarly, alliances with enough dominion leverage among
their members through provincially local areas can dispose of a provincial
leader and collapse a province into assimilation to another province, adding to
the wealth and resources of the province gaining the new areas.
If an alliance loses too much prestige and cannot maintain a
second dominion then it will be the domain with the greatest wealth that they
will lose and they will keep their less valuable domain.
Alpha Phase
During our Alpha development
portion we will be constructing the game one piece at a time and implementing
it onto our testing server. Our carefully selected testers will then take each
new addition and run it through a battery of trials, attempting to break the
new addition or discover ways in which the new additions causes issues with
previously implemented content.
During the last portion of the
Alpha phase, the game will receive its graphical skins, the lighting effects
for the sake of game mood, and other more cosmetic game parts will go into
development. Once the mechanics of the game have been finished and all that
needs added are the virtual cosmetics we will be open to letting our
contributors who have purchased the pre-beta access join into the game and
begin exploring the game and building their lairs and dungeons while we
finalize and confirm the stability of the game and the addition of the premium
shop as a working portion of both the game and the Pyromancy website.
Beta Phase
After the game is deemed completely
stable and the game the premium store can differentiate between members and
non-members, the game will be rolled over into Beta development phase.
During this phase the game will
become completely available to play and open to the public, with working
memberships and premium store items. Our development focus during this phase
will be to increase the content of the game and the premium store to include
all the items and choices that we have in store for the game.
Upon the completion of our various
content lists and without discovering any game mechanics related issues the
game will officially released and all the players and people who supported our
development will be given credit for the assistance that they gave to us. And
we will begin working on one or more of the other game projects that we have
already have intent to develop.
Our Needs
As a new start-up game studio Pyromancy
needs funding to not only cover our basic development costs for our game engine
and servers, but also to cover our basic living expenditures so that we can
devote ourselves to working full-time on the programming and development of our
first game with the intent that if we work hard and get our first game done
right then it will pay our needs while we produce all our future game projects.

the less we will need to work elsewhere to pay our living expenses**
○ 
Combined Living Expenses: $17,900
○ 
Initial Company Salaries: $25,000 
● 
Hire/Contract additional personal to augment the
team: Sound Effects, Artists, Web-designers, Additional Programmers, ect.  **The amount of funds that will be diverted

$400 to pay Indiegogo ( they take 9% of the total amount earned) as well as an additional 5% for other fees etc.
 
If I don't reach the entire goal the purchase priority will be:
Game Creation Software
Licensing
Combat System Scripts
Photoshop/Office
 
About the Game:
The game I will be creating will be an RPG based on technology making it similar to the SNES genre of games. There will be a dynamic story line as well as over 30 hours of game play with numerous side quests and misadventures.
Unfortunately at this time I cannot release any pertinent information such as game title, story line, characters, etc. I need the money to trademark my company's name before I start to release information. I'm currently working with a free version of the software I want to purchase and will have a working demo available (hopefully) shortly after funds are acquired.
The picture included is a snap shot from one of my areas to give you an idea of what the game will look like and where your money is going. Please note that the area may change not at all or completly in the development process!
  Distribution:
My distribution method will be on Steam once my title passes Steam Greenlight and is approved.

Eathral serves as Clavarai’s key source of power in the universe, and is a testament to the legacy of the deities imbued with the ability to create and wield pure Stryah.

Hardware for those team members that require upgrades for their computing work spaces.
The hiring of an organic modeller to design and rig unique in-game entities featured primarily whilst in combat.
 Should funding surpass our current goal, we also have some more ambitious aims, designed to further TwilightStar: Heart of Eir's potential. These include:
At $25,000: We are aiming to build at least 30 hours of solid gameplay into TwilightStar: Heart of Eir in its current form. If funding exceeds our goal by this amount, we would like to add in at least another ten hours.
At $35,000: Currently we are only launching the game to PC. Should funding exceed this amount we would like to explore porting TwilightStar: Heart of Eir over to console gaming systems like PS4 and X-Box One.

<h3>La nostra storia</h3>
<p>Il mio nome è Ylenia e sono la fondatrice di Osmotica, un nuovissimo studio indipendente italiano focalizzato sulla narrazione di storie attraverso diversi format innovativi. Sono specializzata in storytelling e story-editing e ho aperto Osmotica dopo aver lavorato per molti anni come web content manager e docente per adulti, con l’obiettivo “di trasformare un sogno in realtà”: ossia dedicarmi a raccontare storie coinvolgenti e a creare storyworld in cui le persone possano immergersi.</p>
<p><strong>La prima idea di Kubos</strong> è nata alcuni anni fa (sì, anni!): ho lavorato a questa idea in modo maniacale, sviluppando concetti, trame, luoghi e personaggi. Infine, Kubos ha assunto la forma di un progetto transmediale, composto da diverse trame, più formati e piattaforme multimediali.</p>
<p>Come immaginare il mondo di Kubos? Non voglio fare spoiler, quindi mi limito a darti alcune parole chiave: #post-apocalittico, #inquietante, #steampunk, #gotico, #misterioso, qualcosa tra naturale e #innaturale.</p>
<p><strong>Questo mondo è per te se ami:</strong> storie poliziesche, giochi narrativi, atmosfere gotiche, mondi post-apocalittici, misteri, avventura, personaggi forti, amori maledetti, filosofia, scienza e forse pseudoscienza. Oggi Kubos è pronto per venire alla luce e mi piacerebbe condividere questo mondo con persone affascinate dalle stesse cose strane, dalle teorie stupefacenti e dalle tinte cupe che affascinano la mia mente.</p>
<p><strong>Kubos è un grande progetto, che richiede molte risorse</strong>, ma finirò la costruzione di questo mondo comunque vada questa campagna di prevendita/crowdfunding: Kubos, con i suoi paesaggi, abitanti, storie e segreti, non può più essere fermato. Ma non pensare che il tuo supporto non sia importante! Invece è essenziale per arricchire questo mondo utilizzando servizi professionali per creare video, grafiche e meccaniche di gioco più coinvolgenti.</p>
<p>Grazie per permettere che Kubos diventi realtà e per far parte del suo mondo!</p>
<h3>Dentro il gioco</h3>
<p>In questa campagna di crowdfunding puoi acquistare le prime due parti dello storyworld di Kubos: una mobile web app, dove scoprire e giocare la storia principale di Kubos, e un gioco da tavolo, in cui seguire una trama parallela. Il gioco da tavolo è in versione Print&amp;Play: puoi scaricarlo tramite l’app e stamparlo in modo autonomo. In pratica, supportando questa campagna, riceverai: 1 app, 2 giochi e più storie.</p>

<p><strong>Kubos · God Plays Dice</strong> è un gioco narrativo dark per gli amanti delle detective stories e dei mondi post-apocalittici. Assumi il ruolo della profiler Nena Kaos e risolvi il cold case di una delle morti più misteriose nella storia di Kubos.

<p><strong>Come giocare</strong></p>
<p>Per risolvere il cold case, è necessario completare una serie di missioni. Come? Esamina teorie e prove, risolvi codici segreti, interroga persone e guadagna punti. Svela i segreti di Kubos, dove il tempo corre contro le leggi della fisica.</p>

For a few minutes of space action on the train, bus or the doctor's waiting room. Or a few hours at home.That's why we at Ironman project have started our biggest game yet, Armada.After two years of hard work, the game is nearing completion. But to finish it and make it the best game it can be, we need your help!User interface graphics are not finalThey came to eradicate our species. They came to take our planets. We will not give them up.Not without a good fight.Commander Nadjarev, Black Knight SquadronA hundred years ago, thousands of human settlers that were fleeing a devasted earth reached a habitable solar system. They named it's planets after the Titans, mythological gods of the golden era. Life and technological advancement prospered on the ten planets of the system, mankind's new home. Until the original inhabitants returned.The Acari are a species that evolved from highly intelligent insects. It is unknown why they had left the system hundreds of years ago. But fact is that they have returned, and demand it back. We have nowhere else to go, so our only option is to fight.You are part of the Black Knight elite squadron. Each of you will stand against a thousand ships of the Acari Armada.    Don't let the fact that this game runs an a smartphone fool you - this is a ""real"" 3D space combat game like Wing Commander (not quite as story-driven though). You will need skill, a little bit of strategy and ideally some experience with other space games. There is no restricted movement, auto-aim or enemies that only act as cannon-fodder (well, most of them don't). This game is not too easy. But the harder the mission, the greater the satisfaction when you succeed!  Based on four different hull types, you can equip your ship with ten different weapons and a variety of shields, boosters and special modules. Create an agile interceptor or a bulky bomber.    Virtual joysticks have a bad reputation among players of mobile games. Many developers go with gyro controls instead. But they have their own disadvantages and wouldn't fit a game like Armada.Our solution: Virtual sticks, done the right way. Flexible, configurable, crazy precise while also allowing fast maneuvers. Think of the advantages of a mouse and stick combined (except the sensory feedback of course).Our testers usually begin to really appreciate the controls after 5-10 minutes of playing.If you still prefer physical controls, of course you can use a gamepad or even a flightstick. (Additional hard- and/or software may be needed - if your pad works with any Android game at all, it will work with Armada.)  You are playing with pilots all over the world in a shared solar system. Every victory takes the human settlers closer to freedom - every defeat does the opposite.   A skilled wingman on your side will make any mission a lot easier. Their ship will be controlled by the computer, but their equipment and skills will match the ones of the real player.  We know that mobile players often only have a few minutes for their game. Therefore, the missions in Armada can be finished in 3 to 10 minutes.

<h3>The Save Ferris Project, in a nutshell:</h3>
<p class=""p1"">Who IS Ferris, and why does he need to be saved? Imagine you have lost your job.  That’s not an uncommon occurrence, but during the subsequent job search, your health starts to fail.  You have a wife and 4 children who depend on you, but your health is so poor that you are no longer physically able to do the tasks at the job that supported them for 10 years.  What do you do?  You might start feel adrift and directionless. <br/><br/> I imagine if your friends came to you with a solution to your dilemma – a way to start over in a new field so you could support your family again, you might jump at the chance.  <br/><br/> And that is The Save Ferris Project:  giving Ferris a chance for a new focus for life, through on the job education.  Oh, and building some <em>really cool video games</em>, too!</p>
<p class=""p1"">Along the way we're going to have a lot of fun - see, we're not doing things quite like a normal crowd sourced fundraiser.  That would be boring.  Instead, there's real-world meet and greet at places like the Great Plains Reniassance Festival on September 22nd &amp; 23rd, where you can meet the founder of the fundraiser in person.  And contests &amp; giveaways, like two free tickets to Midwest Beerfest - nothing like wining free beer for just helping spread the word.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We'll be raising funds to handle a few basic things:<img alt=""Funds Distribution"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thesaveferrisproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ferrisfundsdistribution.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Funds Distribution""/></p>
<p>1) Funding to pay Ferris a paycheck for two years.  Only a portion on the fundraiser goes towards that - part of the cost is handled by my company (Midnight Ryder Technologies) and as game sales begin, the long term costs of his employment are further defrayed until we reach the break even point on sales.</p>
<p>2) Equipment.  Ferris has a fairly old computer, none of the software necessary, and not even a comfy chair in my office to work from.</p>
<p>3) Various business support bits - taxes, the percentages that go to IndieGoGo and PayPal, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>4) Engine and content licensing - that way, the time between breaking ground on development of each of the games and profiting from release is reduced to as short as possible.</p>
<p>A complete breakdown of all the funds distribution (including what the plan becomes if funding exceeds the planned amount) is <a href=""http://www.thesaveferrisproject.com/where-does-the-money-go/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">available online</a>.</p>
<p>This will allow for Ferris's training and the release of FIVE new games from <a href=""http://www.midnightryder.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Midnight Ryder Technologies</a> over the next two years.  Curious what's on the menu?  We've put our <a href=""http://www.thesaveferrisproject.com/the-games/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">list of planned games online,</a> too!</p>

</div></div>","The Save Ferris Project, in a nutshell:
Who IS Ferris, and why does he need to be saved? Imagine you have lost your job.  That’s not an uncommon occurrence, but during the subsequent job search, your health starts to fail.  You have a wife and 4 children who depend on you, but your health is so poor that you are no longer physically able to do the tasks at the job that supported them for 10 years.  What do you do?  You might start feel adrift and directionless.  I imagine if your friends came to you with a solution to your dilemma – a way to start over in a new field so you could support your family again, you might jump at the chance.   And that is The Save Ferris Project:  giving Ferris a chance for a new focus for life, through on the job education.  Oh, and building some really cool video games, too!
Along the way we're going to have a lot of fun - see, we're not doing things quite like a normal crowd sourced fundraiser.  That would be boring.  Instead, there's real-world meet and greet at places like the Great Plains Reniassance Festival on September 22nd & 23rd, where you can meet the founder of the fundraiser in person.  And contests & giveaways, like two free tickets to Midwest Beerfest - nothing like wining free beer for just helping spread the word.


What We Need & What You Get
We'll be raising funds to handle a few basic things:
1) Funding to pay Ferris a paycheck for two years.  Only a portion on the fundraiser goes towards that - part of the cost is handled by my company (Midnight Ryder Technologies) and as game sales begin, the long term costs of his employment are further defrayed until we reach the break even point on sales.
2) Equipment.  Ferris has a fairly old computer, none of the software necessary, and not even a comfy chair in my office to work from.
3) Various business support bits - taxes, the percentages that go to IndieGoGo and PayPal, that sort of thing.
4) Engine and content licensing - that way, the time between breaking ground on development of each of the games and profiting from release is reduced to as short as possible.
A complete breakdown of all the funds distribution (including what the plan becomes if funding exceeds the planned amount) is available online.
This will allow for Ferris's training and the release of FIVE new games from Midnight Ryder Technologies over the next two years.  Curious what's on the menu?  We've put our list of planned games online, too!
And there is a huge list of perks for helping us reach our goal, along with the cool giveaways happening during the 90 day fundraising period!

<p>John Zhao, a Chinese computer-based designer who works in AR (Augmented Reality), is the father of a five-year-old girl. He loves 

his daughter, but his work used to take so much of his time that he could rarely be with her. He wanted to change this situation.</p>
<p>Two years ago it occurred to him to use his talents to make her a special gift. He took two weeks to 

write an iPad program featuring two virtual 3D characters, a dinosaur and a rabbit. He drew the two animals on paper cards, then used the iPad to scan each one. Bang! The dinosaur and rabbit popped up on the screen! They were almost 

lifelike, and could say hello if you touched them. His daughter loved them so much that she showed them to all her friends, and more and more kids came to love his invention. They called the pictures AR Magic Cards.</p>
<p>To develop more 

cards, John dropped the work that he was doing, and began to explore the potential of his new idea with his team. The first version they developed is called AR Magic Cards I, which is already very popular in China. However, this version 

is only available in Chinese, and John's dream is to give every kid a chance to play with his cards and experience AR. He needs an opportunity to attention to his invention, and also money to develop an English version - AR Magic Cards 

II, which has more interesting functions and games.</p>

John Zhao, a Chinese computer-based designer who works in AR (Augmented Reality), is the father of a five-year-old girl. He loves 

his daughter, but his work used to take so much of his time that he could rarely be with her. He wanted to change this situation.
Two years ago it occurred to him to use his talents to make her a special gift. He took two weeks to 

write an iPad program featuring two virtual 3D characters, a dinosaur and a rabbit. He drew the two animals on paper cards, then used the iPad to scan each one. Bang! The dinosaur and rabbit popped up on the screen! They were almost 

lifelike, and could say hello if you touched them. His daughter loved them so much that she showed them to all her friends, and more and more kids came to love his invention. They called the pictures AR Magic Cards.
To develop more 

cards, John dropped the work that he was doing, and began to explore the potential of his new idea with his team. The first version they developed is called AR Magic Cards I, which is already very popular in China. However, this version 

is only available in Chinese, and John's dream is to give every kid a chance to play with his cards and experience AR. He needs an opportunity to attention to his invention, and also money to develop an English version - AR Magic Cards 

II, which has more interesting functions and games.

happiness to hundreds of thousands children. Now,

This project is to raise funds for the next playing cards art project. Plus, I'd like to get your input on what that art should be. So now only will you receive gorgeous Arthur Rackham Fairy Tale art playing cards, posters, prints and more, you will also be very influential in directing the future works of our little company's playing card division. So what do you think I should do next? A friend suggested more Arthur Rackham, specifically Wagner's Ring. Someone else suggested more Fairy Tale art (Alice in Wonderland was one idea). I'd also like to do some fine art cards like Henri Rousseau's work - or Georgia O'Keefe's or some of the Impressionists or DaVinci's sketches...
 
About These Cards and Prints
Arthur Rackham's (1867-1939) haunting and dreamlike illustrations enliven famous works such as Wagner's The Ring of Nibelung, Midsummer Night's Dream, Twilight of the Gods, Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, Alice in Wonderland, Mother Goose, Undine, Wind and the Willows, Gulliver's Travel King of the Golden River and more.  Some of Arthur Rackman's most famous works also adorn these stylish playing cards.
 
The Impact

 
For every thousand dollars raised I can begin a new card project. And your input can help determine what art will grace the card faces of the next project.

<hr/><h2>A little taste of history</h2>
<p>Some of our most cherished stories start with the phrase “Once upon a time “ and come to a more or less abrupt conclusion. This is not the case with our story. It refuses to end because it is a story about football, passion, tradition and human nature in general. It connects continents and is a tale more than a 100 years in the making…</p>
<p>Somewhere in a far off land, our ancestors invented a way to reduce the craving for playing football during the cold winter months. It was the year 1900. The game was coined “<strong>Gombfoci</strong>”, a rather self-explanatory term, which describes a game played with buttons from coats upon a kitchen table. It spread like wildfire and soon came to be well known in such far off lands as Spain, USA or Brazil. These people changed the rules and by this created a new game called “12 Touches”, which later became an even greater success than its predecessor. (Geraldo Cardoso Décourt’s, in 1928).</p>

<p>The path from amateur to professional game playing and sportsmanship took some time, until the early championships were established in the Americas (in 1950’s Brazil), as well as in Europe, where the first European championship took place in 1958, in Hungary. The Brazilian Football Table Game laid the foundation, and was on a collision course with its sibling, Sector Ball, the original Hungarian version. Both of them had Federations, shared almost identical game pieces, but were strikingly different when it came to their rules.</p>
<p>Have you ever met someone who has been playing this game for more than 50 years? We did! Don’t be mistaken! We aren’t talking here about a game which is purely for the older generation. It is a game cherished by a universal age category, starting from the young to the old. There are thousands and thousands of registered players and the numbers are going to go through the roof after we will succeed in making this project happen. This is a project that will be remembered for quite some time to come, by players who will have been charmed by it… And the best thing is that you can play an active part in writing this game's history.</p>
<h2>The project</h2>
<p>Our mission and vision is to unify the two games in one box. <strong>Same board game, two approaches.</strong> East meets West on the same ""soccer pitch"": Sector Ball Table Soccer game vs. 12 Touches Brazilian Game. Pretty awesome, if you ask us!</p>
<p>Why? After talking to some of our members from our local board game club, where table soccer competitions are held regularly, we discovered that people like both games but expressed a desire to experience a board game which combines both of them. Playing at professional level is very difficult and involves a lot of training and is sadly not possible in the majority of cases to train at home. The main reason for not being able to practice at home is the size of the table, which is 180 cm long by 120 cm wide. Our idea is to give them the means to practice wherever they choose to, given the smaller size of the board, and when the moment comes; they will effortlessly conquer their completion in tournaments.</p>
<p>This project is designed for home users. Many of us remember playing an older version back in the day. The quality of its components was quite bad but nevertheless, we played a lot, and occasionally it even happened that our parents joined in. We organized championships in the neighborhood and we had a lot of fun. Days upon days of endless joy!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""SectorBall logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://boardgamefootball.com/publ_images/coperta_orig.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We want to revive these times and build a community. People who want to play this game at home are the people who want to have fun by competing with their friends face-to-face, share real emotions! It is destined for those who choose to do this instead of playing in front of the computer.</p>
<h1>PLEASE don't forget to tell your friends about this so we can keep the momentum going and make these as awesome as they can be!</h1>
<p>The project is set up to offer the “<strong>offline</strong>” players diversity by giving them an alternative to computer games. We also aim to provide clubs with another reason to organize good championships with skilled players. We strive to bring different generations together by engaging parents and children in sharing the passion of playing this game, thus creating excitement and joy around the table and giving them the opportunity of playing soccer even in winter time. This will give supporters the chance of playing the role of their favourite players on the pitch.</p>
<h2>The G-CODE or the online system ...</h2>
<h3 style=""color: #900;""><em><strong>H3N6-MJKL-5645-KPGT - decoding ... decoding ... please <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sectorball-12touches-table-soccer/x/2441229#sect5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">go to the F.A.Q. section, point 5 ...</a></strong></em></h3>
<h2>STRETCH GOALS!</h2>
<p>The current pricing is for 2000 boardgame with a complete tournament manager website. <br/>We would like to reach our goal, but wait and see what we'll do with every 5000 EUR! <br/>We will still release the game even if we have to do it from our own budget we will keep up the fight until we succeed!</p>
<h3>So here we go!</h3>
<h3>5,000 EUR: We will randomly select 10 Romanian orphanages and give away one SectorBall game to each one of them.</h3>
<h2>The goals ...</h2>
<p>Our primary goals are to produce the first board games and to build the online community for social reasons. We set the goal of producing 2.000, corroborated with ample actions in at least 5 countries. In this way we can get the ball rolling and initiate the movement.</p>
<p>The online system provides an environment where people can register, create tournaments, upload results, make comparisons, interact with other communities, exchange collectibles, and inform themselves about the official competitions - advanced or professional tournaments, organized by the <strong><em>International Sectorball Federation (ISBF)</em></strong>.</p>
<h1>""SECTORBALL is a football game that you can play from dawn til dusk.""</h1>
<p>Our expectations are high for the future, that’s why we need 30.000 euro to fund the design, online software, concept, prototypes, marketing, commercial, production of initial games and the creation of the online community. We are totally dedicated towards this project, because it is real and it is happening as you are reading these lines. We need to raise funds to create and accelerate the making of this new community. A brief summary business plan can be available upon request.</p>
<h2>Commercial and marketing strategy ...</h2>
<p>At first glance, you might ask yourself<strong><em> “How can you be sure that you can really make this happen?”</em></strong>. We will give our best to succeed or die in the attempt (metaphorically speaking of course)! We possess the needed know how because we are in a constant dialog with gamers, because we track the gaming habits and trends through countries, because we work with very talented designers, programmers, copywriters and creative people. It is also important to note, and should not be overlooked that most of us are confident businessmen with over 15 years of experience. In the worst case scenario, the game will be made and will follow a steady development. Not depending upon primary marketing fail or success, the Game will exist and we need you beside us! You will be proud to say that you gave a chance to a unifying concept that is quickly spreading around the world.</p>
<p>The idea is pretty simple – if people play, the game is required. And people play! </p>
<h2>How the money will be spent.</h2>
<p>No doubt you've noticed the surprisingly large sum we're requesting to finish SectorBall. Believe it or not, this is actually cheap for a boardgame, and the only reason it's even this cheap is because we will also cover some costs.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of how the money will be spent:</p>
<p>3000 EUR: Staff Salaries - 3 people for 2 months<br/> 1500 EUR: Desiger team for all the design elements<br/> 12000 EUR: Printing 2000 boardgame, paper part<br/> 10000 EUR: Website with complex database system behind for tournaments organizing, etc.<br/> 10000 EUR: Plastic parts of the game, players, ball, etc for 2000 games<br/> 1500 EUR: QA Testing<br/> 500 EUR: Bar codes and CE code<br/> 2700 EUR: IndieGoGo and Payment Processing Fees for 30000 EUR<br/> 1000 EUR: Shipping the games<br/> 3000 EUR: Advertising online<br/> 1000 EUR: Other unknown expenses</p>
<h2>The game ...</h2>
<p>Inside the box, there will be two games containing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>• 2 teams for a total of 10 players<br/> • 4 goalkeepers, 2 for Sector Ball and 2 for 12 Touches<br/> • 2 type of soccer ball, one for Sector Ball and one for 12 touches<br/> • The board, 60 x 90 cm (we still dream about 100 x 70 cm)<br/> • The score board<br/> • 4 mm margin for the board, plastic, to keep the players and the ball on the field<br/> • Hour glass for measuring 10 minute<br/> • 10 unique codes for registering on our website, for you and your friends<br/> • Rulebooks for Sector Ball and for 12 Touches<br/> • Stickers for each player</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The board is the same, only the rules are different. The rulebook will be translated into 6 languages at the beginning (English, Spanish, German, French, Hungarian, Romanian), with the help of the community, the soccer fans.</p>
<p><img alt=""SectorBall"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://boardgamefootball.com/publ_images/unpacked-game-500px.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Aren't you curious about a few rules?</strong> There are 2 x 10 minute game periods, no offside, players can mark valid goals only from opponent side, and the rest is like in real soccer.</p>
<p><strong>Sector Ball:</strong> Each player has one turn. If he can pass the ball from the button to a valid ""sector"", 4.5 cm, not touching other button, there is an extra move. If he can again pass to the next button in the same way, again he has an extra move. This can continue until he fails to pass or have a valid sector and the ball is on the opponent side, where he can shoot. The player asks the opponent to place the goalkeeper and then he shoots to score.</p>
<p><strong>12 Touches:</strong> Here we talk about maximum 12 touches per player. This means if a button touches the ball and the ball does not touch the opponent button, then he can continue again with the same button or with another button. One button can pass maximum 3 times, then you must play with another button. Once the foe fails, by the ball touching the opponent button, he loses the next move. But if the ball is on the adversary’s side, he can ask to shoot a goal! Opponent can place the goalkeeper!</p>
<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<p><strong>1) I just made my contribution on a perk with more than one options. How will I know when the box will arrive?</strong></p>
<p>Once our funding goal is met, we will contact you via email to verify your postal address and to let you know when we will ship.</p>
<p><strong>2) When will you release the game?</strong></p>
<p>We scheduled to have the game ready to be released at Spiel 2013 in Essen-Germany in October 2013.<br/> The production of the game will be done by Germany's largest manufacturer ensuring the highest quality of the components.</p>
<p><strong>3) Shipping Cost for perks or for pre-order?</strong></p>
<p>The game will be dispatched to EU delivery and very soon will be available in stores in EU. For USA and Canada the game will be delivered via postal services. We have a flat shipping cost for EU, USA and Canada which is included in the Perk levels.</p>
<p><strong>4) How can I pay?</strong></p>
<p>Payments are processed through Paypal which ensures the security of your transaction. That does not mean that you need to have a Paypal account or that you have to create one. You can use any Credit Card. All of the payment will go through this website.</p>
<p><strong>5) How will the online registration work? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, that is a good question. We will try to give you an answer as short as possible, but that may take some time. There will be G-Codes (unique codes) in the game. There will be 10 codes, 1 Master Code and 9 Friend Codes. The person, who will buy the game and will handle the championships with his friends, will register with the Master Code, and this is the moment when he becomes a ""tournament organizer"". He is the one who will register his own friends, who will become his own players. </p>
<p>The tournament organizer will be able to create championships (group based, rounds based, swiss) and to add the scores, the markers (optional), the minute of the goal (optional) and other details that will be important in a game. At the end of the championships he will have the possibility to print out a diploma for the 1st-6th place. </p>
<p>The system will award experience points (XP) for each tournament in which a player can participate. For ex.: If you play a tournament with your friends, you receive 1XP for the game and 1XP for each point in the competition. If you have won 6 times and had 2 ties, you get 6x3 + 2x1 = 20XP, meaning a total of 21XP points. </p>
<p>These points will accumulate in time and you may reach, let’s say, 250XP points. The system will monitor the points and we suggest groups from the same areas to meet and organize larger contests. <br/> Each year a European championship will be held where the best players in Europe will be invited. This contest will be the basis for the invitation. In the same time the best players will be invited to learn the professional version of the game and to participate in professional championships.</p>
<p><strong>6) This game is same as Subbuteo?</strong></p>
<p>Subbuteo is an another style. We play with buttons (somewhere in 1900-1950 the game used to be played with coat buttons). <br/>Initially it was in 1905 the game GOMBFOCI - a hungarian style, then in time it became widespread all over the world. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_football"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_football</a>) <br/>From this version people in Brazil made the 12 Touches (most popular), 3 Touches, 1 Touches Fotbal de Butao, which started somewhere in 1920 or around. <br/>Also in time Subbuteo was made together with and other soccer game. Why? Because people like to play soccer and so do I :) <br/>I have played SectorBall since I a was child, and since then 30 years have passed. Then it was a period when I did not play at all, but I started again in 2010. <br/>I play it at a professional level. But as our main problem is that we do not have any new players, I thought it was time to get out a smaller version for home playes. The goal is to teach new people to play, to organize tournaments for them, to meet them online using a well structured website and then invite the best boardgame players to bigger tournaments to get professionals. This is behind this game and I hope we will succeed. Of course is a hard investment which I don't have (it is more then 30K) but I believe I will find people who will support this game.</p>

A little taste of history
Some of our most cherished stories start with the phrase “Once upon a time “ and come to a more or less abrupt conclusion. This is not the case with our story. It refuses to end because it is a story about football, passion, tradition and human nature in general. It connects continents and is a tale more than a 100 years in the making…
Somewhere in a far off land, our ancestors invented a way to reduce the craving for playing football during the cold winter months. It was the year 1900. The game was coined “Gombfoci”, a rather self-explanatory term, which describes a game played with buttons from coats upon a kitchen table. It spread like wildfire and soon came to be well known in such far off lands as Spain, USA or Brazil. These people changed the rules and by this created a new game called “12 Touches”, which later became an even greater success than its predecessor. (Geraldo Cardoso Décourt’s, in 1928).




Detailed history on wiki page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_football
The path from amateur to professional game playing and sportsmanship took some time, until the early championships were established in the Americas (in 1950’s Brazil), as well as in Europe, where the first European championship took place in 1958, in Hungary. The Brazilian Football Table Game laid the foundation, and was on a collision course with its sibling, Sector Ball, the original Hungarian version. Both of them had Federations, shared almost identical game pieces, but were strikingly different when it came to their rules.
Have you ever met someone who has been playing this game for more than 50 years? We did! Don’t be mistaken! We aren’t talking here about a game which is purely for the older generation. It is a game cherished by a universal age category, starting from the young to the old. There are thousands and thousands of registered players and the numbers are going to go through the roof after we will succeed in making this project happen. This is a project that will be remembered for quite some time to come, by players who will have been charmed by it… And the best thing is that you can play an active part in writing this game's history.
The project
Our mission and vision is to unify the two games in one box. Same board game, two approaches. East meets West on the same ""soccer pitch"": Sector Ball Table Soccer game vs. 12 Touches Brazilian Game. Pretty awesome, if you ask us!
Why? After talking to some of our members from our local board game club, where table soccer competitions are held regularly, we discovered that people like both games but expressed a desire to experience a board game which combines both of them. Playing at professional level is very difficult and involves a lot of training and is sadly not possible in the majority of cases to train at home. The main reason for not being able to practice at home is the size of the table, which is 180 cm long by 120 cm wide. Our idea is to give them the means to practice wherever they choose to, given the smaller size of the board, and when the moment comes; they will effortlessly conquer their completion in tournaments.
This project is designed for home users. Many of us remember playing an older version back in the day. The quality of its components was quite bad but nevertheless, we played a lot, and occasionally it even happened that our parents joined in. We organized championships in the neighborhood and we had a lot of fun. Days upon days of endless joy!

We want to revive these times and build a community. People who want to play this game at home are the people who want to have fun by competing with their friends face-to-face, share real emotions! It is destined for those who choose to do this instead of playing in front of the computer.
PLEASE don't forget to tell your friends about this so we can keep the momentum going and make these as awesome as they can be!
The project is set up to offer the “offline” players diversity by giving them an alternative to computer games. We also aim to provide clubs with another reason to organize good championships with skilled players. We strive to bring different generations together by engaging parents and children in sharing the passion of playing this game, thus creating excitement and joy around the table and giving them the opportunity of playing soccer even in winter time. This will give supporters the chance of playing the role of their favourite players on the pitch.
The G-CODE or the online system ...
H3N6-MJKL-5645-KPGT - decoding ... decoding ... please go to the F.A.Q. section, point 5 ...
STRETCH GOALS!
The current pricing is for 2000 boardgame with a complete tournament manager website. We would like to reach our goal, but wait and see what we'll do with every 5000 EUR! We will still release the game even if we have to do it from our own budget we will keep up the fight until we succeed!
So here we go!
5,000 EUR: We will randomly select 10 Romanian orphanages and give away one SectorBall game to each one of them.
The goals ...
Our primary goals are to produce the first board games and to build the online community for social reasons. We set the goal of producing 2.000, corroborated with ample actions in at least 5 countries. In this way we can get the ball rolling and initiate the movement.
The online system provides an environment where people can register, create tournaments, upload results, make comparisons, interact with other communities, exchange collectibles, and inform themselves about the official competitions - advanced or professional tournaments, organized by the International Sectorball Federation (ISBF).
""SECTORBALL is a football game that you can play from dawn til dusk.""
Our expectations are high for the future, that’s why we need 30.000 euro to fund the design, online software, concept, prototypes, marketing, commercial, production of initial games and the creation of the online community. We are totally dedicated towards this project, because it is real and it is happening as you are reading these lines. We need to raise funds to create and accelerate the making of this new community. A brief summary business plan can be available upon request.
Commercial and marketing strategy ...
At first glance, you might ask yourself “How can you be sure that you can really make this happen?”. We will give our best to succeed or die in the attempt (metaphorically speaking of course)! We possess the needed know how because we are in a constant dialog with gamers, because we track the gaming habits and trends through countries, because we work with very talented designers, programmers, copywriters and creative people. It is also important to note, and should not be overlooked that most of us are confident businessmen with over 15 years of experience. In the worst case scenario, the game will be made and will follow a steady development. Not depending upon primary marketing fail or success, the Game will exist and we need you beside us! You will be proud to say that you gave a chance to a unifying concept that is quickly spreading around the world.
The idea is pretty simple – if people play, the game is required. And people play! 
How the money will be spent.
No doubt you've noticed the surprisingly large sum we're requesting to finish SectorBall. Believe it or not, this is actually cheap for a boardgame, and the only reason it's even this cheap is because we will also cover some costs.
Here's the breakdown of how the money will be spent:
3000 EUR: Staff Salaries - 3 people for 2 months 1500 EUR: Desiger team for all the design elements 12000 EUR: Printing 2000 boardgame, paper part 10000 EUR: Website with complex database system behind for tournaments organizing, etc. 10000 EUR: Plastic parts of the game, players, ball, etc for 2000 games 1500 EUR: QA Testing 500 EUR: Bar codes and CE code 2700 EUR: IndieGoGo and Payment Processing Fees for 30000 EUR 1000 EUR: Shipping the games 3000 EUR: Advertising online 1000 EUR: Other unknown expenses
The game ...
Inside the box, there will be two games containing:

• 2 teams for a total of 10 players • 4 goalkeepers, 2 for Sector Ball and 2 for 12 Touches • 2 type of soccer ball, one for Sector Ball and one for 12 touches • The board, 60 x 90 cm (we still dream about 100 x 70 cm) • The score board • 4 mm margin for the board, plastic, to keep the players and the ball on the field • Hour glass for measuring 10 minute • 10 unique codes for registering on our website, for you and your friends • Rulebooks for Sector Ball and for 12 Touches • Stickers for each player

The board is the same, only the rules are different. The rulebook will be translated into 6 languages at the beginning (English, Spanish, German, French, Hungarian, Romanian), with the help of the community, the soccer fans.

Aren't you curious about a few rules? There are 2 x 10 minute game periods, no offside, players can mark valid goals only from opponent side, and the rest is like in real soccer.
Sector Ball: Each player has one turn. If he can pass the ball from the button to a valid ""sector"", 4.5 cm, not touching other button, there is an extra move. If he can again pass to the next button in the same way, again he has an extra move. This can continue until he fails to pass or have a valid sector and the ball is on the opponent side, where he can shoot. The player asks the opponent to place the goalkeeper and then he shoots to score.
12 Touches: Here we talk about maximum 12 touches per player. This means if a button touches the ball and the ball does not touch the opponent button, then he can continue again with the same button or with another button. One button can pass maximum 3 times, then you must play with another button. Once the foe fails, by the ball touching the opponent button, he loses the next move. But if the ball is on the adversary’s side, he can ask to shoot a goal! Opponent can place the goalkeeper!
F.A.Q.
1) I just made my contribution on a perk with more than one options. How will I know when the box will arrive?
Once our funding goal is met, we will contact you via email to verify your postal address and to let you know when we will ship.
2) When will you release the game?
We scheduled to have the game ready to be released at Spiel 2013 in Essen-Germany in October 2013. The production of the game will be done by Germany's largest manufacturer ensuring the highest quality of the components.
3) Shipping Cost for perks or for pre-order?
The game will be dispatched to EU delivery and very soon will be available in stores in EU. For USA and Canada the game will be delivered via postal services. We have a flat shipping cost for EU, USA and Canada which is included in the Perk levels.
4) How can I pay?
Payments are processed through Paypal which ensures the security of your transaction. That does not mean that you need to have a Paypal account or that you have to create one. You can use any Credit Card. All of the payment will go through this website.
5) How will the online registration work? 
Yes, that is a good question. We will try to give you an answer as short as possible, but that may take some time. There will be G-Codes (unique codes) in the game. There will be 10 codes, 1 Master Code and 9 Friend Codes. The person, who will buy the game and will handle the championships with his friends, will register with the Master Code, and this is the moment when he becomes a ""tournament organizer"". He is the one who will register his own friends, who will become his own players. 
The tournament organizer will be able to create championships (group based, rounds based, swiss) and to add the scores, the markers (optional), the minute of the goal (optional) and other details that will be important in a game. At the end of the championships he will have the possibility to print out a diploma for the 1st-6th place. 
The system will award experience points (XP) for each tournament in which a player can participate. For ex.: If you play a tournament with your friends, you receive 1XP for the game and 1XP for each point in the competition. If you have won 6 times and had 2 ties, you get 6x3 + 2x1 = 20XP, meaning a total of 21XP points. 
These points will accumulate in time and you may reach, let’s say, 250XP points. The system will monitor the points and we suggest groups from the same areas to meet and organize larger contests.  Each year a European championship will be held where the best players in Europe will be invited. This contest will be the basis for the invitation. In the same time the best players will be invited to learn the professional version of the game and to participate in professional championships.
6) This game is same as Subbuteo?
Subbuteo is an another style. We play with buttons (somewhere in 1900-1950 the game used to be played with coat buttons). Initially it was in 1905 the game GOMBFOCI - a hungarian style, then in time it became widespread all over the world. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_football) From this version people in Brazil made the 12 Touches (most popular), 3 Touches, 1 Touches Fotbal de Butao, which started somewhere in 1920 or around. Also in time Subbuteo was made together with and other soccer game. Why? Because people like to play soccer and so do I :) I have played SectorBall since I a was child, and since then 30 years have passed. Then it was a period when I did not play at all, but I started again in 2010. I play it at a professional level. But as our main problem is that we do not have any new players, I thought it was time to get out a smaller version for home playes. The goal is to teach new people to play, to organize tournaments for them, to meet them online using a well structured website and then invite the best boardgame players to bigger tournaments to get professionals. This is behind this game and I hope we will succeed. Of course is a hard investment which I don't have (it is more then 30K) but I believe I will find people who will support this game.

Unlocked at $4,000: A 6th surprise token by Inkwell Looter will be included in the Populate, Entwine, and Soulbond Packages.
Drive a Tranquil Bargain 
Over the years, I've met some people who have quit playing Magic because they couldn't afford it.  We all know it: these cards can be pretty expensive.  Crazy expensive, even. 
As the game grows in popularity and price, for many people it becomes increasingly difficult to continue playing, and if you're on a budget it's not fun to feel like you lost to the deck that's just packed full of all the expensive stuff.
PucaTrade has already saved its members over $80,000 by completing more than 15,000 trades.

Our Innovative MtG Trading Solutions


Do you have a hard time finding people to trade with?   PucaTrade offers an Intelligent Trade-Matching system that automatically connects you with people who want the cards you're offering.  

Are you tired of arguing over card prices?  We were too.  Our Card Value Index has the prices of cards pre-loaded, so you'll enjoy a haggle-free trading experience, along with full-value for your cards.

Are you hesitant to trade by mail?  Our Trade Guarantee assures the success of every trade or you’ll be reimbursed in full for the value of your cards, so you can trade with confidence.
 
Beyond Beta: Our Goals for this Project
Our overarching goal for this project is to make this free-trading service self-sustainable by developing crucial features and tools that will help make the site instantly understandable and accessible; especially to people who are visiting for the first time.  We also hope to create branded PucaTrade merchandise that will help to increase the site's membership and thus help to cover the costs of operations.


GOAL #1: PucaTrade Swag — We've designed great stuff with our logo on it, but we need help covering the cost of production.  Help spread the word with PucaTrade Card Sleeves, Playmats, T-shirts, Hoodies, and much more below!  If we achieve this goal, Team PucaTrade will also drive to major MtG events and conventions on the West Coast to get the word out.

GOAL #2: A Delightful User Experience — We will make PucaTrade instantly understandable to people that visit for the first time, and you’ll be able to start trading immediately upon signing up. 

GOAL #3: A Social Community — We’ll build ways to communicate with one another on the site, so that you can leave feedback and rate your experiences with other traders. This will also provide you with more control over who sends you cards.
 
Visual Elegance for an Intuitive Trading Experience
What happens if we exceed our goal?
Producing branded merchandise to help get the word out is just the beginning.  If we exceed our $8,000 goal, all additional funds will be used to continue to build the following features for PucaTrade:
 
What do I get for donating?
$12, SHROUD:  A 100ct pack of our custom card-sleeves emblazoned with the radiant PucaTrade logo. Printed on Legion brand high-quality sleeves.

$20, TRANSFORM:  Format buttons by Inkwell Looter.  Let everyone know what MtG you're into with 6 of these Legacy, Modern, Standard, Cube, Commander, and Trade buttons. 
 
$25, ENTWINE:  Why choose just 1 mode? Gimme the Sleeves, Buttons, and Tokens! 
$25, BUYBACK:  2,500 Trade Credits on PucaTrade.  Thinking about buying $25 of cards any time soon?  Why not get them on PucaTrade and support this project at the same time?
 
$30, FORTIFY:  Roll out to your FNM in style, and represent this new way to trade.  Designed by the delightful gent BeardyPlays.

$35, EQUIP:  Your choice of our Team PucaTrade T-shirt or the ""Circle of Stuff: Green"" T by Inkwell Looter.  Silkscreened by hand on American Apparel Ultra soft 50/50 poly-cotton T's in Men or Women's XS, S, M, L, and XL.

 $1,000, MIRACLE:  YOU are the real Miracle, and I'm yours for a day.  I fly to you anywhere in the US and hand-deliver everything from the SOULBOND package.  While I'm in town, we'll celebrate your major contribution to this project by playing some MtG with you and your friends, help play test the new competitive build you're working on, deck-tech all your decks, or whatever you want! (within reason).  OR you could come to the San Francisco Bay Area and I'll set up a day of MtG here. Thanks for helping keep the dream of PucaTrade alive!

<h3>Arrapha and the dark side of weird.</h3>
<p>  My name is Amon 26, I've been developing games independently since 2008 and I'm responsible for the titles  All Of Our Friends Are Dead, Au Sable, Gyossait, MooD: Waist High In Hell, and Senora.  </p>
<p> I'm currentley in the middle of developing my new title Arrapha.  A tale of high adventure in a dark weird world filled with terrible creatures.  It's been heavily inspired by both film and game classics like Castlevania, Army of Darkness, Ninja Gaiden, and The Addams Family.  It's meant to be both a comedic yet horrific romp through the surreal and hilarious.</p>
<p> As this is my dayjob, and paychecks don't show up until after a publisher makes a bite, my money is running low.  I need help to make ends meet as I draw closer to the projected deadline.  After some number crunching I decided 3,500 will keep me solvent long enough to see Arrapha to completion.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>That's right I need money!</h3>
<p>  $3,500 is a magic bullet, it will cover me for about 3 months worth of rent and provide me with 2,000 left over for utilities, food and internet.  </p>
<p>In the event that I don't make the projected goal I'll still be able to use any and every penny I get to keep myself solvent and just go as long as possible.  Unfortunatley, that will mean I'll need to split my time between Arrapha and a day-job which will drastically hamper progress.</p>
<p>Each and every person who donates will be included in the credits of the game as financial supporters, even a dollar's worth.</p>
<p>$10+ gets you a demo of Arrapha featuring all of act 1 which won't be officially distributed online</p>
<p>$100+ gets you a package of wallpapers featuring characters, settings, and scenes from Arrapha scaled to fit desktop and phone/handsets.</p>
<p>$500+ gets you a set of 4 large posters featuring Arrapha characters, A mailing address will be required for this</p>
<p>$1000+ Gets you a hand-made laptop bag themed after Arrapha, each one designed to look like something owned either by Keith or Runira.  Again this will require a mailing address.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Something old, Something new.</h3>
<p>Games today are either so heavily formulaic you lose track of which one is which, or fixated on shifting paradigms to a fault. I was raised by a wild pack of Nintendos circa 1982 and while I'm from the old-skool I'm also a strong believer in adopting the best of what's happened since then and doing my best to marry the past with the present in a way that's exciting to me.</p>
<p>By donating to the Arrapha project, you're standing up and saying ""I want to have my cake and eat it too!""  You're helping to draw a line in the sand and putting on the grizzliest most depraved devil-rock leather-clad beast-slashing madness this side of a sprite-sheet.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Get Dirty!</h3>
<p>Obviously I know money doesn't grow on trees, and sometimes no matter how much you want to donate, you need to eat and you're in desperate need for a new pair of underwear.  And that's cool!  (get the silk ones btw)</p>

</div></div>","Arrapha and the dark side of weird.
  My name is Amon 26, I've been developing games independently since 2008 and I'm responsible for the titles  All Of Our Friends Are Dead, Au Sable, Gyossait, MooD: Waist High In Hell, and Senora.  
 I'm currentley in the middle of developing my new title Arrapha.  A tale of high adventure in a dark weird world filled with terrible creatures.  It's been heavily inspired by both film and game classics like Castlevania, Army of Darkness, Ninja Gaiden, and The Addams Family.  It's meant to be both a comedic yet horrific romp through the surreal and hilarious.
 As this is my dayjob, and paychecks don't show up until after a publisher makes a bite, my money is running low.  I need help to make ends meet as I draw closer to the projected deadline.  After some number crunching I decided 3,500 will keep me solvent long enough to see Arrapha to completion.


That's right I need money!
  $3,500 is a magic bullet, it will cover me for about 3 months worth of rent and provide me with 2,000 left over for utilities, food and internet.  
In the event that I don't make the projected goal I'll still be able to use any and every penny I get to keep myself solvent and just go as long as possible.  Unfortunatley, that will mean I'll need to split my time between Arrapha and a day-job which will drastically hamper progress.
Each and every person who donates will be included in the credits of the game as financial supporters, even a dollar's worth.
$10+ gets you a demo of Arrapha featuring all of act 1 which won't be officially distributed online
$100+ gets you a package of wallpapers featuring characters, settings, and scenes from Arrapha scaled to fit desktop and phone/handsets.
$500+ gets you a set of 4 large posters featuring Arrapha characters, A mailing address will be required for this
$1000+ Gets you a hand-made laptop bag themed after Arrapha, each one designed to look like something owned either by Keith or Runira.  Again this will require a mailing address.


Something old, Something new.
Games today are either so heavily formulaic you lose track of which one is which, or fixated on shifting paradigms to a fault. I was raised by a wild pack of Nintendos circa 1982 and while I'm from the old-skool I'm also a strong believer in adopting the best of what's happened since then and doing my best to marry the past with the present in a way that's exciting to me.
By donating to the Arrapha project, you're standing up and saying ""I want to have my cake and eat it too!""  You're helping to draw a line in the sand and putting on the grizzliest most depraved devil-rock leather-clad beast-slashing madness this side of a sprite-sheet.


Get Dirty!
Obviously I know money doesn't grow on trees, and sometimes no matter how much you want to donate, you need to eat and you're in desperate need for a new pair of underwear.  And that's cool!  (get the silk ones btw)
You have so much more power at your fingertips then you might know,  you can simply pass this along to other friends who might be interested, OR you could do something totally freakin' gonzo with the idea and help me publicize my project by means of your own personal tallents.
Do you draw?  Draw an Arrapha picture and put it on your deviant art/facebook/Twitter!  Do you write or blog?  Interview me!  Films?  Clothing? Needlepoint? Fine cuisine?  You get the idea.
Get creative and spread the word of Arrapha with the fire that keeps you going!  Let them know Amon 26 sent you and he wants to rock their face off! Tell them the tale of this strange, strange man who is making Chainsaws Rideable!!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

(Game summary directly taken from<a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=92924211"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> its Steam Greenlight</a> page) (Note that the video is somewhat old as it was taken in the 0.78a version. At the moment, the game is in version 0.9a and it is quite more polished and optimised.)</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Private Infiltrator is an arcade-like Stealth game that bears the Noir art style.<br/><br/> In 1867, ASB was founded by a mysterious criminal figure. It was a private corporation and its sole purpose was global domination. Its intentions were masked to the public by the legitimate packaging business it had as a front. Another mysterious figure, rich, powerful and clever enough to deduce that ASB was behind the recent crime wave founded WEC, a corporation whose sole task was to prevent the ASB from achieving their goal. Since then, an invisible war was fought between these two private corporations. Over the years, WEC had been slowly disrupting the ASB's operations and preventing their plans from being materialised. After destroying most of the ASB's assets, WEC sent their best Agent to the heavily guarded ASB Base in order to destroy both it and what was left of the ASB once and for all.  Private Infiltrator tells the story of what happened in that mission.<br/><br/>The game's core mechanics are fairly simple and easy to pick up, yet difficult to master while also retaining a satisfying amount of depth. They revolve around the double-sided nature of light in stealth games enriched by the Noir art style's principles, hacking and bypassing electronic devices, as well as elegant evasion of detection.<br/><br/> At the player's disposal are numerous gadgets such as sound-emitting decoys and poisoned coffee, as well as special abilities such as Blinking and Invisibility. Building on the core gameplay are extra mechanics such as a point reward system accompanied an in-game black market with a dynamic economy system from where the player can either purchase useful equipment, or exploit the fluctuating prices in order to gain profit by selling loot they can steal from the base. <br/><br/>The game also features a wide variety of unlockables such as new characters with their own special abilities, entirely new pieces of soundtrack and bonus maps. The game's difficulty level could be described as both diverse and brutal, offering awareness and resource management challenges amongst the classic stealth gameplay. There is also a relatively strong story element to the game, although in order to fully experience and understand the game's plot the player must rely on written text scattered, and some times hidden, throughout the base. Completing side-objectives also has an effect in the later stages of the game.<br/><br/>Included is also a Cat &amp; Mouse themed multiplayer game, where players take turns in being the hunter or the hunted, while using their equipment to accomplish their objectives. Finally, the game never ceases to retain a humorous and slightly over-the-top attitude that is evident in little details such as the cheesy elevator music and the ridiculous pieces of equipment such as the music player that will make any guard who picks it up listen to music, effectively making them unable to hear the player.<br/><br/> Even though the core gameplay was heavily inspired by titles like Metal Gear Solid, a lot of the game's mechanics were inspired by other titles such as Thief and Deus Ex, that combine into a unique experience that will highly entertain enthusiasts of the genre.<br/><br/>Free content updates have also been at the core of our focus (Besides easter eggs and deus ex references); ideas that derive from even the most minor of external influences have the possibility of becoming full-fledged mechanics available as updates. (For instance, someone mentioned that PI's difficulty resembled Thief's difficulty in terms of brutality, and simply that evolved into adding stealable loot throughout the levels and the full-fledged economy system)</p>

<h3>A Fun Family Game</h3>
<p><b>Irresponsibility </b> is a family friendly card game for 2-4 players. Players take turns either helping Mr Toast be irresponsible by playing fun Recreation cards or by saddling your opponents with Responsibility cards to keep Mr Toast from having fun.  Mr Toast's friends also get in on the action as Buddy cards who add to your score, thanks Joe the Egg!  You also get to play Action cards which can let you draw more cards, play extra cards or even take over another players position.  The winner is the first person to get to 15 points worth of Recreation &amp; Buddy cards!</p>
<h3>Meet Mr Toast &amp; His Friends<br/>
</h3>
<p>The star of the game is Mr Toast.  Also along for the ride is his best friend Joe the Egg.  Mr Toast's next door neighbor is the ever nervous Shaky Bacon.  Many of their other friends and acquaintances <span><span></span></span>make appearances including Clem Lemon, Lemon Ed, Mope the Onion, Lil' Leif, Eugene and Roy the Mushroom.</p>

<h3>Hasbro's Great Game Contest</h3>
<p>One other aspect of this campaign is that <b>Irresponsibility</b> is one of 5 finalists in Hasbro's Great Game Contest!  Chosen from over 500 games, <b>Irresponsibility</b> is now vying with 4 other games to be the Grand Prize winner who receives $10,000 and a trip to Hasbro headquarters
 for advice, mentoring and assistance.  <b>The success of this campaign will help Hasbro determine who wins the contest.</b>  So it would be great if we could get a ton of backers to show how much people want this game!<br/></p>
<p>But my main priority is to produce a fun game through this campaign.  And no matter what happens with the contest, this game is going to be in your hands!</p>

<h3>What Is the Game<br/>
</h3>The game is a 90 card deck of high quality custom bridge cards, a rules sheet and a slipcase box.  I did all the design and art for the game (check out the Gallery to see all the images in the game).  I have been working on the game for the last 6 months and play testing it throughout that time.  So the <b>GAME IS DONE</b>.  All that needs to be finalized is the printing of the game, box and instructions.  We will be shipping finished, ready to play games by February 2016 at the latest.<br/><br/>The game is for 2-4 players, ages 7 and up.  It takes 5-15 minutes to play and about 10 minutes to learn the rules.  The game is fun for kids but with many different strategic options, game play will also be challenging for adults.<br/>

</div></div>","A Fun Family Game
Irresponsibility  is a family friendly card game for 2-4 players. Players take turns either helping Mr Toast be irresponsible by playing fun Recreation cards or by saddling your opponents with Responsibility cards to keep Mr Toast from having fun.  Mr Toast's friends also get in on the action as Buddy cards who add to your score, thanks Joe the Egg!  You also get to play Action cards which can let you draw more cards, play extra cards or even take over another players position.  The winner is the first person to get to 15 points worth of Recreation & Buddy cards!
Meet Mr Toast & His Friends

The star of the game is Mr Toast.  Also along for the ride is his best friend Joe the Egg.  Mr Toast's next door neighbor is the ever nervous Shaky Bacon.  Many of their other friends and acquaintances make appearances including Clem Lemon, Lemon Ed, Mope the Onion, Lil' Leif, Eugene and Roy the Mushroom.


Hasbro's Great Game Contest
One other aspect of this campaign is that Irresponsibility is one of 5 finalists in Hasbro's Great Game Contest!  Chosen from over 500 games, Irresponsibility is now vying with 4 other games to be the Grand Prize winner who receives $10,000 and a trip to Hasbro headquarters
 for advice, mentoring and assistance.  The success of this campaign will help Hasbro determine who wins the contest.  So it would be great if we could get a ton of backers to show how much people want this game!
But my main priority is to produce a fun game through this campaign.  And no matter what happens with the contest, this game is going to be in your hands!
How to Play the Game


What Is the Game
The game is a 90 card deck of high quality custom bridge cards, a rules sheet and a slipcase box.  I did all the design and art for the game (check out the Gallery to see all the images in the game).  I have been working on the game for the last 6 months and play testing it throughout that time.  So the GAME IS DONE.  All that needs to be finalized is the printing of the game, box and instructions.  We will be shipping finished, ready to play games by February 2016 at the latest.The game is for 2-4 players, ages 7 and up.  It takes 5-15 minutes to play and about 10 minutes to learn the rules.  The game is fun for kids but with many different strategic options, game play will also be challenging for adults.

<br/><br/><h2>Crest - Now on Forever Funding</h2>Crest has reached its goal and we are currently working on the final 
version of it. We have decided to participate in <a href=""https://go.indiegogo.com/blog/2014/09/continuing-success-indiegogo.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiegogo's Forever Funding program</a>, meaning that <b>the campaign will be open for more contributions until March when we begin 
our early access stage.</b> Our original plan for our
 crowdfunding was that it would cover part of our budget, but not all of
 it (and that the rest of the budget would come from loans and 
investors). Luckily for us we now have gotten a loan and we have enough funds to be able to continue our 
production of Crest. We got a budget, but it's a tight one.<br/><br/>Your contributions would help us establish a buffer 
and also buy us time to polish and iterate our game, in short, help us 
make Crest as good as possible. We see this as a chance for our current and new
 fans who have missed the campaign to contribute, but also an 
opportunity for our supporters that want to contribute more to be able 
to do that. Thank you to all of our supporters who have helped us get so far, Crest is on its way!<br/><br/>We restarted the perks for the Forever Funding, so that's why there's no visible claims from the older funders. However, we want to underline that all previous claims to perks will be redeemed of course.<br/><h2><br/></h2><h2><b>What is Crest?<br/></b></h2>Crest is a god game where expression is the
key, creative problem solving is your tools and the goal is to create
interesting interactions and consequences. Witness a world populated
by your followers, wholly autonomous entities that live their own
lives and have their own ways they behave. Your
inclusion into the game is to provide a higher reason for their
continued existence, help them along the way, plan ahead what you
want them to become, see how they evolve and how your relationship
with them grows. Crest is developed for Windows, OS X and Linux.<br/><br/><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/806628/files/20140823074129-CrestTeam.png?1408804889"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p><p></p><p>


We hope you have taken time out to watch our pitch video. It
should be noted that gameplay from the video is taken from our
prototype of Crest, and should not be a representative of what the
full version of Crest will look like or function. <b>We encourage you to try out the prototype for yourself if you are interested in how the game plays
out at this stage of development.</b> <br/></p>

<p><br/></p><p>When you've tried the prototype we encourage you to leave feedback. Since we're still early in the game's

<p></p>Crest's method of input is writing commandments. These
commandments are rule sets for your followers, describing what actions
they should take if certain conditions are met. Commandments can be
used as orders. Safety valves to deal with possible future
situations. They can be linked together to create more defined
outcomes amongst other things. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/751406/files/20140729050917-Commandments.png?1406635757"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>How your followers will respond to
your commandments is not a sure thing however. Followers have many
attributes that deal with how they interact with your commandments. They may forget your commandments. Revert back to how they used to
live their lives once a commandment fades from memory. They may even take
what words you have written and translate them to try and extract the
real meaning behind it. See how their vision of their God develops
and how they attempt to figure out your grand master plan for them.<br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/761013/files/20140802034339-Indiegogo.png?1406976219"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>One of our goals with Crest is to create an engine for history
creation.</b> While in the earlier stages of the game your focus may be
on seeing to it that your followers survive, that they have enough
food to support themselves, eventually the game will proceed to
higher areas of discussion than just basic needs. Your goal will be
to shape society in a way you find interesting and see how your
followers will act. Events that happened before will have
consequences on forthcoming generations; remembrance of hard times may cause followers who lived through these periods to be more adamant about saving their food and cautious of expanding their tribe.</p><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FHRnXhGr_HmM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHRnXhGr_HmM&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FHRnXhGr_HmM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/><p>Expressing yourself in
Crest is done through your people. Your people have characteristics
that modify their behavior, and in correlation with their other
characteristics form the essence of their being. Other factors do
favor into their decision-making. Young, happy followers with high
Chastity characteristic may work very hard to provide food (maybe
enough to provide for the entire city) but will not contribute
towards producing the next generation. Old followers with high
Greed characteristic may be too old to work and will constantly take all the food
the young followers produce for their own use. In Crest your goal is to try and tailor your followers behavior to your liking, and their characteristics is one of their defining traits that you need to think about.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b><b>Creative and easy input with varied consequences -</b></b> Writing
commandments for your followers is easy and will have a huge impact on 
their
lives. You write statements that will trigger actions under specific 
conditions. If you write commandments that are sensible to the
people your commandments may survive unfiltered throughout the ages 
whereas other commandments may be interpreted in new ways and may 
provide
disastrous implications for future generations.</li>
<li>
<b><b>Many ways of expression - 

</b></b>Crest is
about what you want your people to become; there will be situations that you
can solve in several ways, but no real inherent right or wrong. It’s about
experimenting and expressing yourself; through seeing how you can shape your
people, and how they in turn, shape history.<b><br/></b>
</li>
<li>
<b><b>Partake in the legacy of the world – </b></b>The
world and everything in it will change over time, long periods of fruitful
harvest may lead to better chances for forthcoming generations. Artifacts
telling the stories of times passed will decorate the scene. Your people will
evolve, and you may need to evolve along with them.</li>
<li>
<b><b>Indirect control – </b></b>Your
followers are autonomous and have their own behaviors, preferences and needs
that will dictate how they act in the world. Your commandments are also viewed
through their perspective, they may reinterpret what you say and if they
dislike your actions as a God they may even turn against you!</li>
<li>
<b><b>Procedurally generated content </b>- </b>The
world will be randomly generated to ensure that each playthrough will
begin with different conditions for your followers. Cities built in deserts will behave differently from cities in areas with heavy vegetation and so forth. The initial surroundings and the lay of the land will play a definite part in the forthcoming development.</li>

Much of the time spent on Crest has been done without pay, next to studies and other work. Luckily, some members have been able to dedicate themselves fully to the game from time to time and a few of our members saved up money in order to be able to work full time during this summer. We now have reached a point where we have something we can show you which will give a glimpse of what Crest could be.<br/><br/>Everybody on the team is passionate about seeing Crest come to fruition. What we are hoping to achieve with this campaign is not only to raise funds in order to see this happen, but also come in closer contact with our current fans and find new ones. We want you to be as excited about Crest as we are and hope to see it materialize.<br/><br/><h3><br/></h3>

<p></p>
<p>Thanks to the generous contributions of our followers and a loan from Almi, a Swedish incubator, we have enough money to keep us afloat until May. We're currently working full time on developing Crest, but we wish to have more time in order to create a more immersive product. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/756310/files/20140731051423-Concept-art.png?1406808863"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b>Our goal with our campaign was not for you to fund our whole production.</b> We have now also received funding from our municipality and Almi as mentioned above. Obviously, the more sources of funding we can secure, the longer we can spend on producing Crest. <b>Crest will be released, right now its just a question of how big it can become.</b><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>As of today, we have 4 employees. We also employ consultants. When
 it comes to personnel cost, we calculate with a monthly cost of around 
7000 USD. This is, obviously, the largest chunk of our costs and 
will dictate how long we can spend on developing Crest. Our other 
costs (bank, rent, fees) amounts to 150 USD / month. For marketing, 
we plan on investing a total sum of 100-200 USD / month. Additional 
licenses will amount to 3000 USD. We mostly use open source software 
to produce our assets. This is our current budget breakdown:<br/><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/838434/files/20140906081721-Pie-Chart2.png?1410016641"" src="""" style=""""/></p> 
<br/>Instead of increasing our low minimum wages we will use the extra income to be able to extend working on it as many months as we are able to make a better game. Your contributions would give us more time to work on Crest and help us out with all other costs that quickly pile up during game production.<br/><br/>

Supporting Crest financially doesn't just mean getting us closer to 
being able to deliver this game to you, but will also help us establish 
ourselves as an indie game studio that focuses on innovative games we feel is missing from the market. Our plan is to stay in the business for as long as we can. If we raise above our intended goal, it means we get more funding into our studio without strings attached; we will be less dependent towards third parties and can spend more time polishing Crest.<br/>

<p>We’re Eat Create Sleep, a small indie studio situated on an island called Gotland (Sweden) in the Baltic Sea. Apart from Roland who has previous experience in professional game development as an audio designer, the other four of us are graduate students from Uppsala University, with bachelor degrees in game design. We’ve all spent years with making smaller experimental games and have now moved on to make a commercial career out of our studies. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/751411/files/20140729051227-Logo---Final.png?1406635947"" src="""" style=""width: 228.288px;height: 244px;""/></p>
<br/><p>We strive to be a studio that take the game medium further and create more meaningful experiences in the game scene. To achieve this we take risks both when it comes to theme and on the way we produce them, but we never reinvent the wheel just for laughs. We’re deeply rooted in game history and conventions, but we aim to explore new paths.</p>
<p>Before we started making Crest, a part of the team started making their first full featured game. Oskar and Martin met in 2012 at their university and started on the ecological management simulation game Among Ripples early 2013. We learned a lot about polishing a project and taking it all the way from start to finish. It was released in the beginning of April, 2014 and has garnered a lot of positive feedback since then. <br/></p>
<p>We’ve appeared on several outlets with positive reviews and have several impressions on Youtube. The game is available for free and can be <a href=""http://eatcreatesleep.net/amongripples"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">downloaded right away</a>, so don’t take our word for it. During the later stage of production for Among Ripples we rallied more 
creative and brave people behind us and started on our new vision, 
Crest. A continuation on our first game in more than one way. <br/></p>

<b>What is the goal of Crest?</b><br/>Crest invites the player to define his/her own goal. If all your followers die you will lose the game, but Crest is not a game where you constantly struggle for survival. During play testing some players have opted for goals such as trying to spread their civilization as much as possible or trying to maintain a balance in the community. We hope the full version will inspire you to experiment and reach for whatever goal you feel is interesting.<br/><b><br/><b>How long can a game session be?</b><br/></b>Crest has no set time limit, players are free to play for as long as they like. Our goal with Crest is to offer gameplay that will keep the player invested in the same session for a substantial amount of time.<br/><b><br/><b>How does player and followers communicate?</b><br/></b>The player will communicate with the followers by commandments; telling them how to behave and how to react in specific situations. The followers will give feedback to the player, ranging from how their work day went to their needs and how they feel about their god. The player is free to ignore or try to appease the people, it will not entirely be clear at all times what actions will better their disposition.<br/><b><br/><b>What is missing from the prototype that will be in the full version?</b><br/></b>The design of the full version of Crest is still dependent on how much funding we can secure. What we want is more immersive feedback, more focus on the gameplay evolving to higher levels as time goes by. More ways to express yourself through your commandments. More interactions between the followers and the world that they populate. A substantial late-game experience that will keep the player invested in the history that will play out.<br/><b><br/><b>Is Crest going to be alpha funded?</b><br/></b>Hopefully. What platform we will use we cannot say yet.<br/><b><br/><b>Why are you not asking for money for the whole production?</b><br/></b>We do not wish to rely entirely upon the generosity of our fans; with your invaluable support we feel we can attain funding from other sources and not ask you for everything. We believe the sum we have set for the campaign is attainable for our fans, both new ones we will gain and our old ones.<br/><b><br/><b>How much is Crest going to cost?</b><br/></b>We are currently unsure of what price we will attach to Crest, the price will vary based on what we value the end product. We want a fair price based on both our target audience and the work effort we have put in.<br/><br/><b>What platforms are Crest going to be released on?<br/></b>Our ambitions is to release it on Steam, Desura, Humble Store and itch. Once we get to post-production we may want to release it for more platforms however. What we want is to have it accessible on many sites so our fans have the option to choose a platform they feel comfortable with.<br/><br/><b>Is Crest going to be DRM-protected?</b><br/>Apart from the Steam version (if we get greenlit) there will be no required DRM to play our game. So if you don't want it on Steam, then you won't need to worry.<br/><b><br/><b>What languages will Crest be released in?</b><br/></b>Due to the uncertainty of Crest's future we are focused right now on just developing a full version we feel does justice to the concept; so we are settling for just an English release. If we have the time, money and resources once we have finished Crest it is a definite possibility however to translate it into other languages.<br/><b><br/><b>Will Crest be released for tablets or other platforms in the future?</b><br/></b>We do not currently have plans for it, but if the fans want it we are open to investigate how migrating the game to other platforms would affect the experience. It's a possibility.<br/><br/><b>Why does the Early Access perk cost so much compared to the Game perk?</b><br/>Our perks are not pre-order products, but incentives for supporting our crowdfunding. All our perks above 15$ give the funder a peek into the process of Crest before it's released as a full game. Our intention is to get the early adopters onboard, those who believe so strongly in us that they think they can safely spend a higher amount.<br/><br/>Since we don't treat the perks as pre-order products they do not represent the final price tag when Crest has become a product.<br/><br/><b>Is your game inspired by god game X?</b><br/>The game is inspired above all by religion and ancient history, and not so much by any specific game. That's how we usually do at ECS, we prefer to start from scratch. But when we've looked at mechanics for inspiration we've looked at The Sumer Game/Hammurabi, Dwarf Fortress, The Civilization series and City Building games such as Pharaoh. <br/>
</div></div>","Crest - Now on Forever FundingCrest has reached its goal and we are currently working on the final 
version of it. We have decided to participate in Indiegogo's Forever Funding program, meaning that the campaign will be open for more contributions until March when we begin 
our early access stage. Our original plan for our
 crowdfunding was that it would cover part of our budget, but not all of
 it (and that the rest of the budget would come from loans and 
investors). Luckily for us we now have gotten a loan and we have enough funds to be able to continue our 
production of Crest. We got a budget, but it's a tight one.Your contributions would help us establish a buffer 
and also buy us time to polish and iterate our game, in short, help us 
make Crest as good as possible. We see this as a chance for our current and new
 fans who have missed the campaign to contribute, but also an 
opportunity for our supporters that want to contribute more to be able 
to do that. Thank you to all of our supporters who have helped us get so far, Crest is on its way!We restarted the perks for the Forever Funding, so that's why there's no visible claims from the older funders. However, we want to underline that all previous claims to perks will be redeemed of course.What is Crest?Crest is a god game where expression is the
key, creative problem solving is your tools and the goal is to create
interesting interactions and consequences. Witness a world populated
by your followers, wholly autonomous entities that live their own
lives and have their own ways they behave. Your
inclusion into the game is to provide a higher reason for their
continued existence, help them along the way, plan ahead what you
want them to become, see how they evolve and how your relationship
with them grows. Crest is developed for Windows, OS X and Linux.


We hope you have taken time out to watch our pitch video. It
should be noted that gameplay from the video is taken from our
prototype of Crest, and should not be a representative of what the
full version of Crest will look like or function. We encourage you to try out the prototype for yourself if you are interested in how the game plays
out at this stage of development. 










When you've tried the prototype we encourage you to leave feedback. Since we're still early in the game's 
development now is the best time to tell us what you think. We're 
interested to hear everything from bugs to what you'd think would be 
nice to see in the future.


Crest's method of input is writing commandments. These
commandments are rule sets for your followers, describing what actions
they should take if certain conditions are met. Commandments can be
used as orders. Safety valves to deal with possible future
situations. They can be linked together to create more defined
outcomes amongst other things. How your followers will respond to
your commandments is not a sure thing however. Followers have many
attributes that deal with how they interact with your commandments. They may forget your commandments. Revert back to how they used to
live their lives once a commandment fades from memory. They may even take
what words you have written and translate them to try and extract the
real meaning behind it. See how their vision of their God develops
and how they attempt to figure out your grand master plan for them.One of our goals with Crest is to create an engine for history
creation. While in the earlier stages of the game your focus may be
on seeing to it that your followers survive, that they have enough
food to support themselves, eventually the game will proceed to
higher areas of discussion than just basic needs. Your goal will be
to shape society in a way you find interesting and see how your
followers will act. Events that happened before will have
consequences on forthcoming generations; remembrance of hard times may cause followers who lived through these periods to be more adamant about saving their food and cautious of expanding their tribe.Expressing yourself in
Crest is done through your people. Your people have characteristics
that modify their behavior, and in correlation with their other
characteristics form the essence of their being. Other factors do
favor into their decision-making. Young, happy followers with high
Chastity characteristic may work very hard to provide food (maybe
enough to provide for the entire city) but will not contribute
towards producing the next generation. Old followers with high
Greed characteristic may be too old to work and will constantly take all the food
the young followers produce for their own use. In Crest your goal is to try and tailor your followers behavior to your liking, and their characteristics is one of their defining traits that you need to think about.















Creative and easy input with varied consequences - Writing
commandments for your followers is easy and will have a huge impact on 
their
lives. You write statements that will trigger actions under specific 
conditions. If you write commandments that are sensible to the
people your commandments may survive unfiltered throughout the ages 
whereas other commandments may be interpreted in new ways and may 
provide
disastrous implications for future generations.

Many ways of expression - 

Crest is
about what you want your people to become; there will be situations that you
can solve in several ways, but no real inherent right or wrong. It’s about
experimenting and expressing yourself; through seeing how you can shape your
people, and how they in turn, shape history.


Partake in the legacy of the world – The
world and everything in it will change over time, long periods of fruitful
harvest may lead to better chances for forthcoming generations. Artifacts
telling the stories of times passed will decorate the scene. Your people will
evolve, and you may need to evolve along with them.

Indirect control – Your
followers are autonomous and have their own behaviors, preferences and needs
that will dictate how they act in the world. Your commandments are also viewed
through their perspective, they may reinterpret what you say and if they
dislike your actions as a God they may even turn against you!

Procedurally generated content - The
world will be randomly generated to ensure that each playthrough will
begin with different conditions for your followers. Cities built in deserts will behave differently from cities in areas with heavy vegetation and so forth. The initial surroundings and the lay of the land will play a definite part in the forthcoming development.

 Our team has worked on Crest since October 2013. Much of the time spent on Crest has been done without pay, next to studies and other work. Luckily, some members have been able to dedicate themselves fully to the game from time to time and a few of our members saved up money in order to be able to work full time during this summer. We now have reached a point where we have something we can show you which will give a glimpse of what Crest could be.Everybody on the team is passionate about seeing Crest come to fruition. What we are hoping to achieve with this campaign is not only to raise funds in order to see this happen, but also come in closer contact with our current fans and find new ones. We want you to be as excited about Crest as we are and hope to see it materialize.



Thanks to the generous contributions of our followers and a loan from Almi, a Swedish incubator, we have enough money to keep us afloat until May. We're currently working full time on developing Crest, but we wish to have more time in order to create a more immersive product. 


Our goal with our campaign was not for you to fund our whole production. We have now also received funding from our municipality and Almi as mentioned above. Obviously, the more sources of funding we can secure, the longer we can spend on producing Crest. Crest will be released, right now its just a question of how big it can become.






As of today, we have 4 employees. We also employ consultants. When
 it comes to personnel cost, we calculate with a monthly cost of around 
7000 USD. This is, obviously, the largest chunk of our costs and 
will dictate how long we can spend on developing Crest. Our other 
costs (bank, rent, fees) amounts to 150 USD / month. For marketing, 
we plan on investing a total sum of 100-200 USD / month. Additional 
licenses will amount to 3000 USD. We mostly use open source software 
to produce our assets. This is our current budget breakdown:

 
Instead of increasing our low minimum wages we will use the extra income to be able to extend working on it as many months as we are able to make a better game. Your contributions would give us more time to work on Crest and help us out with all other costs that quickly pile up during game production.

Supporting Crest financially doesn't just mean getting us closer to 
being able to deliver this game to you, but will also help us establish 
ourselves as an indie game studio that focuses on innovative games we feel is missing from the market. Our plan is to stay in the business for as long as we can. If we raise above our intended goal, it means we get more funding into our studio without strings attached; we will be less dependent towards third parties and can spend more time polishing Crest.
  



We’re Eat Create Sleep, a small indie studio situated on an island called Gotland (Sweden) in the Baltic Sea. Apart from Roland who has previous experience in professional game development as an audio designer, the other four of us are graduate students from Uppsala University, with bachelor degrees in game design. We’ve all spent years with making smaller experimental games and have now moved on to make a commercial career out of our studies. 


We strive to be a studio that take the game medium further and create more meaningful experiences in the game scene. To achieve this we take risks both when it comes to theme and on the way we produce them, but we never reinvent the wheel just for laughs. We’re deeply rooted in game history and conventions, but we aim to explore new paths.
Before we started making Crest, a part of the team started making their first full featured game. Oskar and Martin met in 2012 at their university and started on the ecological management simulation game Among Ripples early 2013. We learned a lot about polishing a project and taking it all the way from start to finish. It was released in the beginning of April, 2014 and has garnered a lot of positive feedback since then. 
We’ve appeared on several outlets with positive reviews and have several impressions on Youtube. The game is available for free and can be downloaded right away, so don’t take our word for it. During the later stage of production for Among Ripples we rallied more 
creative and brave people behind us and started on our new vision, 
Crest. A continuation on our first game in more than one way. 
If you want to know more about us you could always play our behind the scenes RPG ""Eat Create Sleep Adventures!"". Become our producer for a second and partake in our journey. Incidentally the soundtrack for ECSA is available as a perk.

<p><strong>Who we are ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I was introduced to card games at 10 years old. Since, I played almost of all wellknow card games. I also have a passion for  classics board games like monopoly, Clue, Payday etc. I've got into role playing games at the age of 17. (Dongeon and dragon second edition, Forgotten Realms). I evolved with a little RPG players community in my home town. We all got very passionate by new board games at the same period of time. Agricola, Small World and Catan are ones of those we got to play all time.  I studied in programmer\analyst course and I also hold a degree as technical support.</strong></p>
<p><strong> With friends, all skilled in coding and creating graphics, we developed a card games platform called Adecke. Our Studio Adecke.inc company has been created 8 months later. In all over a years work. We have completed the first part of our project : the platform. Now is the time to develop games for the plateform and add extra content.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why do we need crowdfunding ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>We are keepin on investing thousands of free work hour's time. Investing also thousand of dollars comming from our own pockets to get the platform online and working sharp. To us, defining the needs of our customers is a must. Our project was several times submitted to many gouvernment programs, but sadly responces were more or less likely the same. According to them, the project does not match with the appliance planning.  They beleive that we must generate sales before getting any support from them.   </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adecke's platform's phylosophy is to provide material to satisfy the mature, good and all kind of gamer. Let us know we are right. Help us to define the Adecke's project</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><strong>Qui somme-nous?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><strong>J'ai été initié au jeux de cartes à l'âge de 10 ans. À ce jour, j'ai joué à la majorité des jeux de cartes populaires. J'ai aussi développé une passion pour les jeux de société comme Monopoly, Clue, Jour de paye etc. J'ai fait mes débuts dans les jeux de rôles sur table à l'âge de 17 ans. (Donjons et dragons 2ième édition, Les royaumes oubliés.) Je me suis impliqué à plusieurs activités reliées aux jeux de rôles dans une communauté dans ma région. Moi et mes amis sommes tous devenus accros aux nouveaux jeux de société, en même temps. Agricola, Small World, Colon de Catan sont les jeux les plus joués dans nos soirées entre amis. J'ai étudié comme programmeur analyste et j'ai complété un cours de soutien informatique.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><strong>Avec des amis, programmeurs et graphistes, nous avons développé une plate-forme de jeux de cartes qui se nomme Adecke. Nous avons créé la compagnie Studio Adecke.inc huit mois passés. Après un an de préparation et un an de production, nous avons réalisé la moitié notre projet : la plate-forme. Afin de finir notre projet, nous devons développer les jeux de cartes prévus et du contenu supplémentaire.</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><strong>Nous investissons des milliers d'heures de travail sans rémunération.

Who we are ?
I was introduced to card games at 10 years old. Since, I played almost of all wellknow card games. I also have a passion for  classics board games like monopoly, Clue, Payday etc. I've got into role playing games at the age of 17. (Dongeon and dragon second edition, Forgotten Realms). I evolved with a little RPG players community in my home town. We all got very passionate by new board games at the same period of time. Agricola, Small World and Catan are ones of those we got to play all time.  I studied in programmer\analyst course and I also hold a degree as technical support.
 With friends, all skilled in coding and creating graphics, we developed a card games platform called Adecke. Our Studio Adecke.inc company has been created 8 months later. In all over a years work. We have completed the first part of our project : the platform. Now is the time to develop games for the plateform and add extra content.  
Why do we need crowdfunding ?
We are keepin on investing thousands of free work hour's time. Investing also thousand of dollars comming from our own pockets to get the platform online and working sharp. To us, defining the needs of our customers is a must. Our project was several times submitted to many gouvernment programs, but sadly responces were more or less likely the same. According to them, the project does not match with the appliance planning.  They beleive that we must generate sales before getting any support from them.   
The Adecke's platform's phylosophy is to provide material to satisfy the mature, good and all kind of gamer. Let us know we are right. Help us to define the Adecke's project

Après 2 ans de travail, aidez-nous à compléter notre plate-forme de jeux... 8 jeux et 9 modes de jeux. Personnalisation, statistiques, échelles de joueurs, trophées, défis.
Qui somme-nous?
J'ai été initié au jeux de cartes à l'âge de 10 ans. À ce jour, j'ai joué à la majorité des jeux de cartes populaires. J'ai aussi développé une passion pour les jeux de société comme Monopoly, Clue, Jour de paye etc. J'ai fait mes débuts dans les jeux de rôles sur table à l'âge de 17 ans. (Donjons et dragons 2ième édition, Les royaumes oubliés.) Je me suis impliqué à plusieurs activités reliées aux jeux de rôles dans une communauté dans ma région. Moi et mes amis sommes tous devenus accros aux nouveaux jeux de société, en même temps. Agricola, Small World, Colon de Catan sont les jeux les plus joués dans nos soirées entre amis. J'ai étudié comme programmeur analyste et j'ai complété un cours de soutien informatique.
Avec des amis, programmeurs et graphistes, nous avons développé une plate-forme de jeux de cartes qui se nomme Adecke. Nous avons créé la compagnie Studio Adecke.inc huit mois passés. Après un an de préparation et un an de production, nous avons réalisé la moitié notre projet : la plate-forme. Afin de finir notre projet, nous devons développer les jeux de cartes prévus et du contenu supplémentaire.
Pourquoi nous voulons nous financer par la foule? (Crowdfunding)
Nous investissons des milliers d'heures de travail sans rémunération. Nous avons investi aussi des milliers de dollars afin que la plate-forme soit opérationnelle et qu'elle fonctionne bien. Pour nous, définir les besoins des joueurs de jeux de cartes en ligne est une priorité.  Notre projet a été soumis à plusieurs programmes gouvernementaux et organismes, mais sans aucun succès.
La philosophie derrière la plate-forme Adecke est de fournir un bon contenu, mature, et pour tous les types de joueurs. Laissez-nous savoir que nous travaillons dans le bon sens. Aidez-nous à finaliser Adecke. 
Conséquences directes :

Offre une bonne opportunité de jouer aux jeux de cartes à bas prix.
Une assurance d'avoir au minimum 8 jeux de cartes et différents tournois fonctionnels.
Desservir une grande communauté de joueurs
Avoir plus de contenu au lancement de Adecke
Aider notre communauté avec la création d'emplois gratifiant et rempli de défi.
Qu'est ce que nous allons faire avec l'argent?
L'argent va être investi par l'équipe Adecke afin de compléter un maximum de contenu et acheter de la publicité au lancement de la plate-forme.  La plate-forme Adecke reste accessible gratuitement durant la période de développement. Elle deviendra payante seulement au lancement.
Qu'est ce que Adecke?
Adecke c'est une plate-forme de jeux qui offre une place de qualité pour jouer au cartes sur internet.  À prix modique, vous pourrez jouer à 8 jeux avec 9 différentes façons à chacuns des jeux.

 Adecke contient également :

Crédits
Système de spécialisation des joueurs
Création de groupe de joueurs
Échelles de joueurs et groupes
Événements de groupes
Trophées
et plus encore...
 Les joueurs seront capable d'acheter avec l'argent virtuel (Crédits) :

Tables de jeux
Plancher de chambre de jeux
Émoticônes
Paquets de jeux de cartes
Le coût pour jouer sur Adecke? Est-ce un site de loto?
Adecke est accessible avec des frais d'abonnement. Vous aurez accès à tout le contenu pour un coût d'abonnement très bas.  Aucune loterie ou activités de type casino sera disponible sur Adecke. L'argent virtuel est seulement utilisé afin de créer du défi pour certains modes de jeux. Il n'y aura aucune façon de gagner de l'argent. Les jeux seront disponibles pour les bonne raisons... avoir du plaisir, relever un défi intellectuel, et passer du bon temps.
Il y aura beaucoup d'éléments graphiques? (Personnalisations)
 Adecke confer une place spéciale pour les artistes. Plusieurs artistes seront approchés afin de participer à la personnalisation de la plate-forme ainsi qu'à la création des éléments de jeux. Les artistes obtiendrons une bonne visibilité auprès des joueurs d'Adecke et de sa communauté.

Adecke est compatible avec les systèmes d'exploitation Windows, Mac et Linux. Après la sortie de Java 8 (Incluant JavaFX) Adecke fonctionnera sous les téléphones intelligents et tablettes  iOS et Android.

</div></div>","What inspires usA teetotum (TTOTUM) is a spinning top that is known across Europe from Roman times. It has a polygonal body - originally four-sided - marked with letters or numbers, which indicate the result of each spin. The name originates from Latin Totum meaning 'all' which was marked by a T on one of the four sides and indicated that the winning player could take all the played tokens.

<p>Welcome to the ancient port of Whitescar, trading hub of the Euredese Sea and the most rank, noisy, wealthy, diverse and dangerous citadel in the known world.  Pull up a seat in <em>The Focsle</em> - one of our better inns - and take a well-earned break from the thieves, smugglers and traders who cram our streets in the summer months.  Have a cooling tankard of Envent beer and put your feet up.  If you're lucky we'll show you how to play our game, the game we Whitescarians have been playing and adapting over the many generations since its creator - and the founder of our city -  met his Gods.  Have you heard of <em>Jaraph's Table?</em></p>
<p> Perhaps you're from one of those far-flung western lands, like Kolan or Arco, and haven't heard of Jaraph Longpin either, although you should've.  Jaraph was the head of a Korrentse tribe called the Biornwald, some four-and-a-half centuries ago.  The Korrentse were a warlike race - still are - and were pirates and bandits by nature.  Betrayed and attacked by those he thought his allies, Jaraph Longpin fought against overwhelming odds and a terrible Korrentse winter and still managed to escape, taking what remained of his tribe across the Western Sea. </p>
<p>The passage was hard - they had to fight campaigns across the wildernesses of Garacraig and The Land of the Dead before settling among the people of Hern, who were fighting a bitter war (the Euredese War, which raged for three generations)  against the island of Merca.  Here Jaraph's leadership, combined with the seafaring skill and martial prowess of his Korrentse warriors, soon swung the tide of the war.  As a reward for his considerable services to Hern, Jaraph was awarded this island.  Back then it was bare rock, just look at it now.</p>
<p> Anyway, the point was - old Jaraph.  Once he'd settled here and all the war and strife was over his warlike mind still craved challenges (beyond the demands made by governance and taxation).  Now advancing in years, he took to what the Korrentse people simply called <em>the Table</em> to keep his faculties honed.  (I think most countries have their own version of the Korrentse <em>Table</em>:  the eastern isles have a games of nobles and warriors played upon a wooden board and west of the Euredese Sea people play their own similar games using coloured beads)</p>
<p> Drawing upon his own campaign experience, Jaraph developed the rules of <em>the Table </em>until he felt it properly reflected the real demands of the battlefield.  Added were more playing pieces, all with specific strengths, weaknesses and abilities, the element of chance (dice were used to resolve attacks) and the strategic importance of terrain - represented by penalties and bonuses for height, rough ground or defensive structures.  <em>Jaraph's Table</em> has been played here in Whitescar for some four hundred years now.  Think you're up to the challenge?</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newmoongames.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""new moon games company page"">New Moon Games</a> are developing Jaraph's Table for PC, Mac and ultimately iOS and Android.  As with other games we've developed independently in the past, we're making Jaraph's Table because it's something we want to play ourselves - a game with a nod towards the old-school turn-based games of the past but with a sizeable dollop of current-gen polish (plus some cool new takes on the traditional strategy genre).  Built in Flash Develop and utilising the powerful Starling framework, Jaraph's Table showcases a fusion of beautifully crafted 3d art and traditional 2d animation which combines to create a unique take on the traditional hex-based TBS.  Play through Jaraph's early campaigns in single-player mode, grab a quickbattle against AI, or challenge you friends and foes to asynchronous multiplayer combat.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>FEATURES:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Single player</strong> - As well as a quick-play section featuring the main game modes, the full game will contain a number of single player campaigns, each containing a series of levels of increasing difficulty. You begin with the short tutorial campaign, which introduces the standard unit types and tactics, before moving on to bigger challenges, such as Jaraph's early battles.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer</strong> - Challenge your friends to a game online and because of Jaraph’s Table's turn-based nature you can either play your battle in one intensive session or sneak your turns while you’re supposed to be working and spread the fight out over the working week.<br/><br/><strong>Heroes</strong> - Every now and then a unit will go to hell and back on the battlefield, and it's only fair that this should be recognised:  a piece which consistently goes above and beyond the call of duty may acquire <strong>Hero</strong> status.  Heroes become unique pieces, with their own names and statistics.  Through each single and multiplayer game, victorious Hero units will acquire experience and perks. Level up your Heroes in the single player campaign and then take them online to battle those of your friends (or enemies, why limit yourself). <br/> Expand your tactical options by unlocking new Hero units and rare unit types by completing campaigns and online challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Battle Canvas - </strong>Rather than resolve combat (rather dryly) on the board itself, all the action in JT takes place on the 'Battle Canvas', which drops down over the board when a piece is attacked.  The resulting combat is played out in visceral, cinematic shadowplay-meets-magic lantern battles - created dynamically and guaranteed to be different every time.</p>
<p><strong>Build your own</strong> - We're building a user-friendly level editor alongside the game, so after the initial game release we'll be following up with an expansion pack which gives access to the level editor and an online community built around user-generated content. Create your own levels and even entire campaigns and share them with your friends or the whole JT community.</p>
<p><strong>New content packs</strong> - In addition to the core game there are several DLC packs planned, including the oriental expansion - which brings new unit designs, a new board and environment and new solo campaigns.  Later packs will include new unit types, campaigns and battle modes.</p>
<p><strong>You can take it with you</strong> - The first release of Jaraph's Table is going to be for PC and Mac. If we exceed our target for funding we'll be porting the game to iOS, Android and potentially Ouya.  The same user information will be accessible across all devices, so if you start a multiplayer game at your workstation you can continue the battle on your iPad or iPhone while you’re on the train, or even on your console when you get home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""jt2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.newmoongames.co.uk/indiegogo/images/JTgrab02.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""jt2""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>UNIT TYPES:</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have lots of additions planned for later, but here are the pieces you will be able to use in the first version of Jaraph's Table:<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Warrior -</strong> Standard melee piece, fast moving and light.  The 'pawn' of JT.</p>
<p><strong>Champion - </strong>Heavy infantry type, slow moving but powerful.  Think of it as the 'tank' or 'phalanx' of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Spy - </strong>The espionage/assassin piece, it remains invisible to the enemy unless discovered by another spy or otherwise rumbled through error.  With the potential to destroy structures and assassinate powerful units, spies can wreak havoc on the board if no counter-espionage units are fielded by the opposing side.</p>
<p><strong>Archer - </strong>The only playing piece capable of ranged combat, the archer is fast, light and ideal for border skirmish actions.</p>
<p><strong>Engineer - </strong>Capable of raising/lowering terrain, draining/flooding tiles and building/repairing resource-gathering structures (farm, woodcutter, mine) as well as defensive towers, engineers can be used to mould the board to your advantage.  The only piece which can traverse water tiles, they are key to a well-balanced strategy, and being very lightly armed should be well guarded.</p>
<p><strong>Herald - </strong>The messenger, or 'comms' piece.  Keep Heralds close to your combat troops for an action point boost.</p>
<p><strong>King - </strong>The most important piece on the board, the King permanently boosts his side's action points and, in <strong>Regicide</strong> mode, is core to success:  lose him and lose the battle.  The King is a powerful unit but commit him wisely - even in future game modes his loss involves hefty action point penalties.</p>

<p><br/><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/NewMoonGames"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>New Moon Games</strong></a> is an independent studio comprised of 4 developers (including 4 artists, 2 animators, 2 designers and 1.5 programmers, so much more than a sum of its parts) based in the historic city of York, England.  As a company we've been together for two years but the core team has collaborated on numerous multi-platform projects over the last eight years or so.</p>
<p><strong>We are:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alex</strong> is our Creative/Art Director, Game Designer, senior 3d bod, the brains behind Jaraph’s Table and master of BBQs.  During his ten year servitude in the mainstream games industry he worked on titles such as Burnout Revenge, Black, Need for Speed Shift and Need for Speed Shift Unleashed - plus some other's he'd rather forget.</p>
<p><strong>Andy</strong> is our Lead Programmer, Managing Director, fledgling cheese-maker and resident inadvertent stunt motorcyclist.  As comfortable with an art package as an algorithm, Andy served his time in web and educational gaming before going, lone wolf style, into the world of independent game development in the noughties.  His can-do attitude almost counts as a fifth member of the team in itself - if Andy can't get it working, it just isn't going to work, period.</p>
<p><strong>Emma</strong> is our Lead Artist, bargain-hunting Ninja, zombie expert and our only proper, bona fide, graduate artist.   Emma is our photo-real texture expert and is responsible for the look and feel of most of the architecture and environments within Jaraph's Table.  She has Burnout Revenge, Black and Need for Speed Shift 1 in her portfolio.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Mike</strong> is our Concept Artist, Lead Animator, pacifist, cage fighter and teller of tall (albeit factually correct) stories.  He is also our most fanatic gamer, with a gamerscore in excess of 72k (He wanted that to be known!) and the uncanny (and infuriating) ability to put a virtual bullet in your head from any angle or distance.  Although a comparative newcomer to the industry, Mike has worked on projects for clients such as Pirelli, WKD, Fruit of the Loom and various internal projects that we could tell you about but Mike would have to kill you. Politely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Aim:</strong></p>
<p>New Moon Games has existed for two years, during which time we've developed a lot of apps, games, cool flash and html5 sites, augmented reality demos etc - but always for someone else (and as we're subcontracted, we go uncredited).  While this pays the bills, it naturally means our own projects have taken a back seat, leaving us treading water in creative terms (especially painful as we have a few games designed and ready for pre-pro and a folder bursting with other game concepts). </p>
<p>In January 2012 we decided to remedy this and push through one of our projects to completion.  Jaraph's Table - a concept which we'd kicked around a few years ago with a sci-fi theme - came out the winner.  Since then we've worked in our own time to get JT to Alpha.  If we can meet our funding targtet, we can get a stompingly good turn-based strategy game out in the Spring of 2013. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img alt=""rewards"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.newmoongames.co.uk/indiegogo/images/1_rewards.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""rewards""/></strong></p>
<p><br/><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/JaraphsTable"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jaraph's Table</a> is at the pre-Alpha/Alpha nebulous border.  Everyone who contributes towards pushing it over this border gets as a bare minimum:  early access to Beta (including forum for feedback and suggestions), the full game on release, plus the Oriental DLC pack (Oriental pieces and troops, playing board, themed environment, custom urban tiles etc), which is already well into development so will follow hard on the heels of initial release.  We're currently planning on releasing Jaraph's Table with the Regicide - Kill the enemy King - game mode, full multiplayer functionality and quick battle and campaign modes in single player.  The singleplayer campaign will be iterated and expanded on in a series of free updates over time.  Both the game and future expansions will be digital download only.</p>
<p><img alt=""JT pieces"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.newmoongames.co.uk/indiegogo/images/JTpieces.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""JT pieces""/></p>
<p>Alternative game modes, different armies, a level editor so you can build your own battlefields and then challenge all comers, hero progression and toggleable game variables such as weather conditions, disease and natural disasters are among the updates planned. We are all avid gamers and want to make Jaraph's Table as good as it possibly can be.</p>
<p>In addition to the enormous Karma of knowing you've assisted indie game development, as a contributor you not only help make these things happen sooner, you get access to them ASAP - and if you beta-test get the chance to tell us directly what you think.  Larger contributors also get the opportunity to become part of the game by having characters named after them, a listing in the credits, design their own army and even - God help them - meet the dev team!*</p>
<p>As none of us want to give up the creative control of our work which being beholden to a large investor or publisher entails, we decided right from the start that New Moon Games would always be an Indie studio.  We have gone with what we consider to be the most honest route by choosing a flexible funding campaign, as we will continue to work on Jaraph's Table in our own time if we have to.  Without your assistance, Jaraph's Table will be released late next year, but your pledges (which will effectively keep us fed, watered, housed and in office space while we work) will help us get there much, much sooner - if we can meet our target that should be the first quarter 2013. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>*Note that Hero names and Piece designs are subject to negotiation and developers' discretion.  Delivery dates for the game and subsequent expansions will rely on how much we are able to raise - Beta is scheduled for the New Year. How things progress with funding and uptake will also dictate what form the launch party takes;  it'll never be like something Sony would lay on, but regardless it will definitely involve copious amounts of good food, booze and nerdiness :)</p>

Multiplayer - Challenge your friends to a game online and because of Jaraph’s Table's turn-based nature you can either play your battle in one intensive session or sneak your turns while you’re supposed to be working and spread the fight out over the working week.Heroes - Every now and then a unit will go to hell and back on the battlefield, and it's only fair that this should be recognised:  a piece which consistently goes above and beyond the call of duty may acquire Hero status.  Heroes become unique pieces, with their own names and statistics.  Through each single and multiplayer game, victorious Hero units will acquire experience and perks. Level up your Heroes in the single player campaign and then take them online to battle those of your friends (or enemies, why limit yourself).  Expand your tactical options by unlocking new Hero units and rare unit types by completing campaigns and online challenges.
Battle Canvas - Rather than resolve combat (rather dryly) on the board itself, all the action in JT takes place on the 'Battle Canvas', which drops down over the board when a piece is attacked.  The resulting combat is played out in visceral, cinematic shadowplay-meets-magic lantern battles - created dynamically and guaranteed to be different every time.
Build your own - We're building a user-friendly level editor alongside the game, so after the initial game release we'll be following up with an expansion pack which gives access to the level editor and an online community built around user-generated content. Create your own levels and even entire campaigns and share them with your friends or the whole JT community.
New content packs - In addition to the core game there are several DLC packs planned, including the oriental expansion - which brings new unit designs, a new board and environment and new solo campaigns.  Later packs will include new unit types, campaigns and battle modes.
You can take it with you - The first release of Jaraph's Table is going to be for PC and Mac. If we exceed our target for funding we'll be porting the game to iOS, Android and potentially Ouya.  The same user information will be accessible across all devices, so if you start a multiplayer game at your workstation you can continue the battle on your iPad or iPhone while you’re on the train, or even on your console when you get home.
 

 
UNIT TYPES:
We have lots of additions planned for later, but here are the pieces you will be able to use in the first version of Jaraph's Table:
Warrior - Standard melee piece, fast moving and light.  The 'pawn' of JT.
Champion - Heavy infantry type, slow moving but powerful.  Think of it as the 'tank' or 'phalanx' of the game.
Spy - The espionage/assassin piece, it remains invisible to the enemy unless discovered by another spy or otherwise rumbled through error.  With the potential to destroy structures and assassinate powerful units, spies can wreak havoc on the board if no counter-espionage units are fielded by the opposing side.
Archer - The only playing piece capable of ranged combat, the archer is fast, light and ideal for border skirmish actions.
Engineer - Capable of raising/lowering terrain, draining/flooding tiles and building/repairing resource-gathering structures (farm, woodcutter, mine) as well as defensive towers, engineers can be used to mould the board to your advantage.  The only piece which can traverse water tiles, they are key to a well-balanced strategy, and being very lightly armed should be well guarded.
Herald - The messenger, or 'comms' piece.  Keep Heralds close to your combat troops for an action point boost.
King - The most important piece on the board, the King permanently boosts his side's action points and, in Regicide mode, is core to success:  lose him and lose the battle.  The King is a powerful unit but commit him wisely - even in future game modes his loss involves hefty action point penalties.
 

 

New Moon Games is an independent studio comprised of 4 developers (including 4 artists, 2 animators, 2 designers and 1.5 programmers, so much more than a sum of its parts) based in the historic city of York, England.  As a company we've been together for two years but the core team has collaborated on numerous multi-platform projects over the last eight years or so.
We are:
Alex is our Creative/Art Director, Game Designer, senior 3d bod, the brains behind Jaraph’s Table and master of BBQs.  During his ten year servitude in the mainstream games industry he worked on titles such as Burnout Revenge, Black, Need for Speed Shift and Need for Speed Shift Unleashed - plus some other's he'd rather forget.
Andy is our Lead Programmer, Managing Director, fledgling cheese-maker and resident inadvertent stunt motorcyclist.  As comfortable with an art package as an algorithm, Andy served his time in web and educational gaming before going, lone wolf style, into the world of independent game development in the noughties.  His can-do attitude almost counts as a fifth member of the team in itself - if Andy can't get it working, it just isn't going to work, period.
Emma is our Lead Artist, bargain-hunting Ninja, zombie expert and our only proper, bona fide, graduate artist.   Emma is our photo-real texture expert and is responsible for the look and feel of most of the architecture and environments within Jaraph's Table.  She has Burnout Revenge, Black and Need for Speed Shift 1 in her portfolio.
Mike is our Concept Artist, Lead Animator, pacifist, cage fighter and teller of tall (albeit factually correct) stories.  He is also our most fanatic gamer, with a gamerscore in excess of 72k (He wanted that to be known!) and the uncanny (and infuriating) ability to put a virtual bullet in your head from any angle or distance.  Although a comparative newcomer to the industry, Mike has worked on projects for clients such as Pirelli, WKD, Fruit of the Loom and various internal projects that we could tell you about but Mike would have to kill you. Politely.
 
Our Aim:
New Moon Games has existed for two years, during which time we've developed a lot of apps, games, cool flash and html5 sites, augmented reality demos etc - but always for someone else (and as we're subcontracted, we go uncredited).  While this pays the bills, it naturally means our own projects have taken a back seat, leaving us treading water in creative terms (especially painful as we have a few games designed and ready for pre-pro and a folder bursting with other game concepts). 
In January 2012 we decided to remedy this and push through one of our projects to completion.  Jaraph's Table - a concept which we'd kicked around a few years ago with a sci-fi theme - came out the winner.  Since then we've worked in our own time to get JT to Alpha.  If we can meet our funding targtet, we can get a stompingly good turn-based strategy game out in the Spring of 2013. 
 

Jaraph's Table is at the pre-Alpha/Alpha nebulous border.  Everyone who contributes towards pushing it over this border gets as a bare minimum:  early access to Beta (including forum for feedback and suggestions), the full game on release, plus the Oriental DLC pack (Oriental pieces and troops, playing board, themed environment, custom urban tiles etc), which is already well into development so will follow hard on the heels of initial release.  We're currently planning on releasing Jaraph's Table with the Regicide - Kill the enemy King - game mode, full multiplayer functionality and quick battle and campaign modes in single player.  The singleplayer campaign will be iterated and expanded on in a series of free updates over time.  Both the game and future expansions will be digital download only.

Alternative game modes, different armies, a level editor so you can build your own battlefields and then challenge all comers, hero progression and toggleable game variables such as weather conditions, disease and natural disasters are among the updates planned. We are all avid gamers and want to make Jaraph's Table as good as it possibly can be.
In addition to the enormous Karma of knowing you've assisted indie game development, as a contributor you not only help make these things happen sooner, you get access to them ASAP - and if you beta-test get the chance to tell us directly what you think.  Larger contributors also get the opportunity to become part of the game by having characters named after them, a listing in the credits, design their own army and even - God help them - meet the dev team!*
As none of us want to give up the creative control of our work which being beholden to a large investor or publisher entails, we decided right from the start that New Moon Games would always be an Indie studio.  We have gone with what we consider to be the most honest route by choosing a flexible funding campaign, as we will continue to work on Jaraph's Table in our own time if we have to.  Without your assistance, Jaraph's Table will be released late next year, but your pledges (which will effectively keep us fed, watered, housed and in office space while we work) will help us get there much, much sooner - if we can meet our target that should be the first quarter 2013. 
 
 
*Note that Hero names and Piece designs are subject to negotiation and developers' discretion.  Delivery dates for the game and subsequent expansions will rely on how much we are able to raise - Beta is scheduled for the New Year. How things progress with funding and uptake will also dictate what form the launch party takes;  it'll never be like something Sony would lay on, but regardless it will definitely involve copious amounts of good food, booze and nerdiness :)",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Icy will be
a narrative experience which will put the player in the role of a nomad family
leader, traveling for survival in a hostile post-apocalyptic world. The player
will be the one who will set the course, manage the supplies and, most of all,
take the important decisions.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1241559/files/20150223020018-_D88A33C43B4EFBA2C707433A0885363115AC5BD58102950C69_pimgpsh_fullsize_distr.jpg?1424685618"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>In terms of
gameplay the player will manage most practical things on a 2D map with a
complete interface that will allow he/she to travel around the world, hunt
in the woods, scavenge old cities searching for something useful, manage the inventory
and the party. All the actions that aren't really interesting from a narrative
point of view will be managed through the map, but Icy is a narrative game and
we created a proper system to let the player shape his/her own story in the
game. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1242267/files/20150223075645-gifdialogo.gif?1424707005"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/>The map will be similar to the ones we saw in games like Fallout or
Arcanum and the player will be able to travel from an important location to
another just by clicking on it. The map system will also simulate the different
kind of terrain and the different levels of danger across the world: travelling
through the woods will be slower than walking on an open road, but bandits can’t
easily detect you and the wild beasts are usually easier to manage than a group
of people armed with guns.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1241541/files/20150223014825-gifscavenging.gif?1424684905"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 349px;""/></p><br/>
<p>All events
that are narratively interesting will be played using a game-book like system.
We will use texts, 2D images, music and sounds to create a compelling
storytelling that will allow the player to have a remarkable freedom of choice
on both short and long terms. The player will have the full control on his/her
character actions and words, allowing a deep roleplaying experience. Having
these two different dimensions of gameplay allow us to create narrative content
only for important events, without creating boring contents or random contents.

<p>The
character's stats will be really important in the game because the outcome of
most choices is directly related to one or more skills. That doesn't mean that
the player won't need to think to do the best choices, but that the plot will be
affected by character's specializations and there will be a lot of different
ways to solve a problem.</p>
<h2><b>Setting</b></h2>
<p>The
post-apocalyptic setting of Icy is characterized by a never-ending winter. It
will have a deep impact on all the themes we are exploring during the game.
Most of the Earth is covered with ice and snow, and the land suitable for
living is only a quarter of what it used to be.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1241556/files/20150223015508-Into_the_storm2.jpg?1424685308"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>What caused
the world to turn into a White Wasteland? No one knows exactly what happened, though the legends are countless. Some say it was war, others say there was a cataclysm, and all stories differ. What is certain is the cloud of dust still in the atmosphere, and the forgotten color of the sky. Will the player have the chance to uncover the truth behind those legends?</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1241557/files/20150223015828-menu.jpg?1424685508"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>The
playable character will be part of a nomad family and will travel around the
Frozen World, constantly worrying about finding food and shelter. Nomads' life
is not easy: banditry is a common activity because there’s no law. The animals
claimed back their land and a small human group is an easy prey for predators.
The harsh climate is a constantly present threat in a survivor's life.</p>
<h2><b>Why Indiegogo?</b></h2>
<p>Why are we
on Indiegogo? Icy is a self-funded project, but the little money we have is not
enough to cover all the expenses we are facing. We could simply cut some
content and release a simpler version of the game, but we want Icy to be as
good as possible. That’s why we are here asking for your support. With a
successful campaign we will be able to cover some legal expenses and spend more
time refining and improving Icy. The result will be a better, more polished and
definitely more enjoyable experience.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1242575/files/20150223100735-ammonation.jpg?1424714855"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h2>Perks</h2><div style=""text-align: center;"">

All events
that are narratively interesting will be played using a game-book like system.
We will use texts, 2D images, music and sounds to create a compelling
storytelling that will allow the player to have a remarkable freedom of choice
on both short and long terms. The player will have the full control on his/her
character actions and words, allowing a deep roleplaying experience. Having
these two different dimensions of gameplay allow us to create narrative content
only for important events, without creating boring contents or random contents.

The
character's stats will be really important in the game because the outcome of
most choices is directly related to one or more skills. That doesn't mean that
the player won't need to think to do the best choices, but that the plot will be
affected by character's specializations and there will be a lot of different
ways to solve a problem.
Setting
The
post-apocalyptic setting of Icy is characterized by a never-ending winter. It
will have a deep impact on all the themes we are exploring during the game.
Most of the Earth is covered with ice and snow, and the land suitable for
living is only a quarter of what it used to be.
What caused
the world to turn into a White Wasteland? No one knows exactly what happened, though the legends are countless. Some say it was war, others say there was a cataclysm, and all stories differ. What is certain is the cloud of dust still in the atmosphere, and the forgotten color of the sky. Will the player have the chance to uncover the truth behind those legends?
The
playable character will be part of a nomad family and will travel around the
Frozen World, constantly worrying about finding food and shelter. Nomads' life
is not easy: banditry is a common activity because there’s no law. The animals
claimed back their land and a small human group is an easy prey for predators.
The harsh climate is a constantly present threat in a survivor's life.
Why Indiegogo?
Why are we
on Indiegogo? Icy is a self-funded project, but the little money we have is not
enough to cover all the expenses we are facing. We could simply cut some
content and release a simpler version of the game, but we want Icy to be as
good as possible. That’s why we are here asking for your support. With a
successful campaign we will be able to cover some legal expenses and spend more
time refining and improving Icy. The result will be a better, more polished and
definitely more enjoyable experience.Perks




FAQ
Will Icy be DRM-free?
Yes, there
will be DRM-free version of the game, at the same price.
On which platform will Icy be
released?
On PC
(Windows, Mac and Linux).
In which stage of development is the game?
We have
finished working on the core features and we’re now polishing and improving it,
in order to release a better game, with more contents and less bugs.Why are you asking only for 2500$?The game is in an advanced phase of the development, we just need some more money to be able to fully polish it. Being gamers we know how annoying could be to buy an incomplete or bugged game, that’s why we want Icy to be fully enjoyable since day one.In which languages will Icy be available?We wrote Icy in English and we have an editor that is already proofreading all the game contents. The game is getting translated in Italian too, but we don’t know if this translation will be available since day one.I noticed that the English is not always so good, are you going to fix this?Yes, we’re working with an experienced editor who is already proofreading all the in-game contents and we will soon integrate all the corrections in the game. Since we have a low budget, we focused our editor’s efforts on the game and not on the marketing stuff, that’s why you may sometimes notice a not so goo englis, but we can asure yu we will works on tis.I don’t want to be racist, but you are an Italian team of developers and I don’t want my money to finance any criminal organization. How can we trust you?If we had our hands in business like drugs dealing, prostitution or weapons smuggling, we could have asked for money from our godfather. Sadly we have no connections with the local organized crime, so we settled for an Indiegogo campaign.I don’t like you and I don’t like your game. What should I do?You should totally back it, taking the cheapest perk available, then wait until the release to criticize us on your socials and in your favorite communities, questioning the overall quality of our project.",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Each chapter of Savior features different levels and distinct gameplay mechanics. As always, our goal is for the player to face unexpected situations throughout the game. Believe us: Savior is not a regular 2D platform.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Each goal funds an additional chapter of the game, and the objective is to create an interconnected world but at the same time one game that certainly we can develop, complete and deliver on time. </p>

<p>Savior isn’t just a game, it’s a reflection of our personal experiences in Cuba, from the crumbling scenery to the unpredictable story to the stylized and hand drawn artwork. It’s a product of our generation and the evolution of the Cuban artistic community. It gives the players the chance to peer into a unique world—in some ways familiar, but increasingly complex the deeper you go.</p>

<p>Our game is a product of this unique moment in Cuban history. The internet is just beginning to spread on the island. Relations with the US are improving. The economy is changing. The people are optimistic for the future, but uncertain what that future will look like.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Cuba is connecting to the rest of the world like never before. Though would have been impossible to create a game like Savior even just a few years ago, we now we have the opportunity to create a game like this in Cuba with a completely Cuban team. It's our chance to bring our unique voice to the global indie game scene.</span></p>

<p>This would be the one of the first crowdfunding campaign for a Cuban team. This is a monumental step for Cuban developers, and the best way that we feel we can raise money for this project.</p>
<p>Cuba is quite a challenging place to develop a game. Internet access is very limited, funding is hard to come by, equipment is out of date, it’s nearly impossible to participate in international festivals and events, and the developer community is just beginning to grow.</p>
<p>But we know that with your help, we can overcome all these obstacles, and create a truly unique experience, and Cuba’s first indie game!</p>
<p>Indiegogo has our heartfelt thanks for this tremendous opportunity. We owe to them, and to you, not only the existence of Savior, but the future of independent gaming in Cuba.</p>

<p>The aesthetic of the game is inspired by two diverse art forms: comic books and stain glass windows. We pay homage to these sources in the stylization of our characters, using heavy contour lines and iconic imagery in our designs.</p>

Stretch Goals
Each chapter of Savior features different levels and distinct gameplay mechanics. As always, our goal is for the player to face unexpected situations throughout the game. Believe us: Savior is not a regular 2D platform.
Each goal funds an additional chapter of the game, and the objective is to create an interconnected world but at the same time one game that certainly we can develop, complete and deliver on time. 
    

Savior is 2D platformer full of crumbling ruins and bloody battles, civilizations on the brink of extinction, broken creatures and flawed heroes. For eons, this universe was kept in order by the Great God, but he has suddenly gone silent.


In his absence, the world begins to collapse, and as reality pulls apart, his followers wonder if they’re living in nothing more than a failing video game. You play as Little God, one of the few “saviors” able to communicate with the Great God, who may be able to restore order to his world.


As your set out to reach the Great God, you must learn to navigate the disintegrating universe and the troubled creatures that inhabit it. There are many other saviors like yourself, each increasingly desperate to save themselves from annihilation. Beware.


Savior isn’t just a game, it’s a reflection of our personal experiences in Cuba, from the crumbling scenery to the unpredictable story to the stylized and hand drawn artwork. It’s a product of our generation and the evolution of the Cuban artistic community. It gives the players the chance to peer into a unique world—in some ways familiar, but increasingly complex the deeper you go.

Our game is a product of this unique moment in Cuban history. The internet is just beginning to spread on the island. Relations with the US are improving. The economy is changing. The people are optimistic for the future, but uncertain what that future will look like.
Cuba is connecting to the rest of the world like never before. Though would have been impossible to create a game like Savior even just a few years ago, we now we have the opportunity to create a game like this in Cuba with a completely Cuban team. It's our chance to bring our unique voice to the global indie game scene.
Join us, and be a part of history.


This would be the one of the first crowdfunding campaign for a Cuban team. This is a monumental step for Cuban developers, and the best way that we feel we can raise money for this project.
Cuba is quite a challenging place to develop a game. Internet access is very limited, funding is hard to come by, equipment is out of date, it’s nearly impossible to participate in international festivals and events, and the developer community is just beginning to grow.
But we know that with your help, we can overcome all these obstacles, and create a truly unique experience, and Cuba’s first indie game!
Indiegogo has our heartfelt thanks for this tremendous opportunity. We owe to them, and to you, not only the existence of Savior, but the future of independent gaming in Cuba.

 



 

 

 
The world of Savior is one of fantastic locations, ghostly ruins and unreal scenery. It’s a melancholy, gloomy vision inspired by the symbolist artists of late nineteenth century. Every inch of Savior looks and feels unique.
 

The aesthetic of the game is inspired by two diverse art forms: comic books and stain glass windows. We pay homage to these sources in the stylization of our characters, using heavy contour lines and iconic imagery in our designs.

Iconic platformers like Earthworm Jim and Demon’s Crest strongly influence the aesthetics and gameplay of Savior, from the world design to the animation.
           
Savior relies on hand-drawn animation, sometimes using an exceptional 54 frames-per-second, which gives the game a human and lifelike feel.  Each creature’s unique movements and flow gives them their own personality.

Though the controls in Savior uses familiar platformer mechanics, as the game progresses, the world becomes increasingly erratic and surprising.
The levels continually confront players with situations both new and strange. Each world possesses its own unique characteristics, running through both the aesthetics and the gameplay.
The combat and interactions of Savior relies on a unique reaction-based gameplay that players must master.

1. To interact or attack, the player first initiates an expanding ring to select an object or attack a creature

2. Once the item or enemy is selected, the player’s halo will flash a particular color command

3. Players must quickly press the correct button to successfully execute their action or attack

4. Using the right sequence of commands and responses, players and trigger increasingly complex and destructive combos


The characters of Savior are as strange as they are diverse. Each world is unique and distinct, as are the creatures that inhabit it.

Little God: Upon discovering that the Great God has abandoned you, your only purpose is to regain his favor and restore his home.
Child: A strange figment that appears in the dreams of Little God. Is it just his imagination, perhaps a dark memory buried deep within him?

Nebro: This old savior lost his mind after being abandoned by the Great God.
Bleeders: Vicious and destructive creatures almost as old as the Great God himself.

Sacred beds: Ancient tombs that allow the saviors to communicate with the Great God through their dreams. There are few of them left, and so many saviors willing to do anything to find them…


Our Cuban-made score provides the perfect atmosphere. Ominous and eerie, the soundtrack only hints at what might befall the players as they explore the world of Savior.





After over a year of discussions, planning, designing, and assembling our team, we’ve worked tirelessly the past several months to bring our project this far. We’re operating in tandem, creating character designs and backgrounds, coding levels and gameplay mechanics, drawing animations, and composting the score.
With this first $10k we’ll be able to launch a playable demo of the game in February of 2017, encompassing the full opening chapter ""The Boy Who Was Born to Die.” We will spend the next year gradually developing the game chapter-by-chapter. Our vision is for Savior to encompass multiple interconnected worlds with many paths and ways to play them.


Empty Head Games is composed of Josuhe Pagliery and Johann Armenteros. Early last year, the two of us entered a non-game called Destroyer in the 12th Havana Bienal, which was well-received and inspired us to pursue game development full-time. Though our work has always been inspired by video games, we’re excited to fully devote our efforts to indie game development.

<h3>The Backstory<br/>
</h3>First and foremost, I kind of came into this campaign believing that I could throw up some ideas and blindly hope for the best. But this is certainly the worst way to go about it. You all deserve a story.<br/><br/>I have been gaming since I was 2. I understand a lot of people make that claim, but I did have a Nintendo controller in my hand before I could thoroughly express my anger verbally when I got destroyed in Marble Madness. The backwards level will be my arch-nemesis forever. Let's continue...<br/><br/>My gaming life only continued to be fantastic. I proudly donned the digital blood of my enemies in Mortal Kombat, got horridly upset when I couldn't figure out the vine level of The Lion King (yes, I played that game-and it was awesome) and refused to play anything other than the Atlanta Hawks in NBA Jam.<br/><br/>At 14, I won second place at a Killer Instinct tournament. Fulgore is still my favorite.<br/><br/>My life, and my gaming, moved to computers accordingly. I built my first computer before the age of 18. Although I must admit, ""gaming computers"" didn't exactly exist then. It was more of a terminal to check my AOL Mail and chat in AOL Chatrooms, but I digress. I built my next computer in my early 20s and upgraded it obsessively for the next 5 years. With all my gained knowledge, I was able to sell my 6 year old build for more than the best computer builds at Best Buy.<br/><br/>In the end, I had to sell my computer simply because real life took precedence. My benchmarking had to be put on hold. Years passed and life crawled forward. I am now in my early 30s and tuition loans, rent, and life bills are still keeping me in the same place; albeit, I am no less happy.<br/><br/>This campaign is to let me be 20 again. Build my computer from the bare bones and pride myself in the final project. <br/><p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story

This idea began as I sat and played a facebook game where I was very aware of what I had to do for the fake coins the game paid me.  I was more careful with them than with my bank account!  Being an artist as well as a computer chick I was also painfully aware of how few of my friends had any comfort in managing their money.  
 

All I could think was how cool it would be if I could simply play a game and have my money taken care of without having to look at graphs and decide on a budget. Shouldn't financial software see where my money goes and tell me I'm close to doom?  If I'm putting in all my receipts shouldn't I see a pretty picture of where it is going?  Maybe a nagging voice telling me not to keep spending on Eating Out cause at this rate eating at all will be difficult?  Why was I still doing all the work?  It's hard and boring and depressing to watch a bottom line fade to zero.   And somehow made me spend more to thumb my nose at stupid world that only rewarded me with a roof over my head for being frugal.

 
It's time to make money easy for the mathmatically challeged.  It's time to teach visual creatures how to spend wisely with intangible cartoon rewards backing up the true success of paying off debt and saving some cash.  With Lori Moucha as a designer and Lee Goffin-Bonenfant as our house nerd and programmer we're gonna Make Real LIfe More Fun!  


THE HOOK!
Of course, as we are at the beginning of a development cycle we've had a lot of ideas about game play, what is fun to do but Lori and I don't alway agree and need your help.  We are going to leave the final game name and game aesthetics UP TO YOU!  If you give us any money at all You GET A VOTE!  

The two finalists are Money Shot! A game where you sling shot money bags into a sky of obstacles and targets!  and in doing so you will be entering your receipts, tracking your bottom line and categorizing your spending so you can see how fat the different areas that take your cash are.

Or we can call it Bank On It! and set you up on a virtual pool table, with receipt balls on the table ready to be smacked into pockets of categories and bouncing off bumpers.

What We Need & What You Get
Ok so what we need is computer equipment, some software, and a way to pay the rent while we pull this game together.  The amount we're asking for as a start is simply to buy a couple of computers, developer rights, some software and an iphone or two for full testing.

Anything above our funding goal will go to pay our rents so we can focus on getting the game out to you. 

Besides a vote we have PERKS to thank you for supporting our dream.  Which you can see on the sidebar.  Plus, of course is a super cool game as a result.  There will be updates with test images, and as I keep thinking of things to give you random rewards thrown into the perks as well.

Once the powers of the old was unleashed the world as we knew it was no more. Having the world broken apart into islands with magical barriers separating some from others changed everything. Many years later portals were discovered which allowed the people living on the planet to once more connect to each other, but with limited knowledge of these portals it is still not easy to travel around and sometimes you don’t end up where you had planned to go…</p>
<p>Islands Of War is a massively multiplayer online (<span class=""caps"">MMO</span>) game set in the time span 600 years after the great Cataclysm. The races have once more fueled their anger towards each other and have forgotten what happened in the first major war. You adventure into this war with your wits and your weapon.

The quest system provides a wide variety of captivating quests with story elements with multiple endings giving that unique feel that the players choices makes a difference to where you will end up. If you combine this with a flexible reward system you have a quest system that will keep captivating your interest.</p>
<p>Islands Of War’s combat skill system is also unique allowing a player to choose there own type of character that suits best their combat style and tactics against multiple opponents. To top it off there is a builders club system allowing players to create their own adventures and game play type with the creation of their own islands. They can share these islands with their friends or if it follows the guidelines it can be incorporated right into the history books of Talgania.</p>

This also allows our builders club members that have built their own Islands which follow the guidelines to add their islands to the main world collection for others to buy, which in return can generate them some revenue, thus opening up the world of Talgania to players to leave their mark in the history books.</p>

<h3>About The Fundraiser</h3>
<p>Goatlings started out as a very small game with around 100 wonderful members. After a great year, the population had grown to over 3,000 wonderful members! However, we realized the programing needed to be upgraded in order to keep everything running smoothly and securely for many years to come. But we did not have enough funding to get it all done at once on our own. After a couple of attempted hacking scares Goatlings has been temporarily closed until the programing is updated. With your help we will surly meet our goal in no time and get Goatlings.com back up again ASAP!</p>
<p>The entire site is being professionally recoded from the ground up. This will make the site more organized, easier to update, more secure, and function a lot smoother. User data will be reorganized and included so members will not lose anything. All features will be updated, missing or half finished features will be completed, and if we are fortunate enough to receive funding over our goal, never before seen features will be added like quests and crafting! The more the fundraiser gains, the more new content will be added!</p>
<p>People who donate will also receive neat perks such as account upgrades, adoption expansion, pet upgrades, unique avatar outfits, stickers, unique pet Goatlings, and much more! <br/><br/>Your donation will keep this beloved pet site running for years to come. Help Goatlings have a bright future!</p>

<h3>About Zeni</h3>
Zeni is probably one of the most amazing people I have had the pleasure of meeting. She has shown countless times that she is dedicated to this site just as much as I am. For months she has been working without pay, dealing with bugs, adding new features, and occassionally getting harrassed by players. Without her, Paka Sanura could never have happened.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
We need to pay Zeni. At the time that I am typing this, the overdue payments add up to $400USD. And yet Zeni has continued working hard for us. When the campaign ends, if we reach our goal, we will have caught up. And that matters to me a lot.</div>
<div>For the next 60 days, this is how members will purchase upgrades.</div>
<div>
<h3>Why This Is So Important</h3>
As the owner of the site, I can calmly and honestly say that I want Zeni to get paid. Without Zeni, we would never function as a site. We need her. And she needs to get paid. Just think, the sooner she gets paid the more likely it is the genetics bugs and crons will get fixed!</div>

<img alt=""Steel Storm: Burning Retribution"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1280.photobucket.com/albums/a484/DISHTY/sstorm_zps999bf818.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> Remember <a href=""http://one.steel-storm.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Steel Storm: Burning Retribution</a>? The top-down arcade shooter developed by Kot-in-Action Creative Artel? Apparently it was pretty good. Now try to imagine a sequel set within the same universe, but adapted into a first person shooter with old school gunplay in the spirit of Doom and Quake with added adventure elements and a rewarding story.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><center>This is <a href=""http://two.steel-storm.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Steel Storm 2</a>.</center></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yes, unlike the original game, Steel Storm 2 will combine vehicle and on-foot action so that players will experience a more engaging and diverse tale from behind the eyes of its protagonist. With your gun facing forward, prepare to head into an action-packed shooting frenzy with discoveries that will send emotions running high.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<center>
<h2><strong>WTF Is Steel Storm 2?</strong></h2>
</center>Steel Storm 2 is a multi-faceted FPS experience. Imagine the breadth of Rage’s gameplay - the vehicular exploration and enemy extermination - but add a storyline that actually rewards you; something more in line with Halo and Darksiders. Now let’s sprinkle in some of the classic features of older shooters: carrying all weapons, no cover, lots of ammo, fast movement, and so on. The visual style is inspired by Ghost in the Shell anime, <span>with a blend of Blood+, Afrosamurai and Appleseed to a degree</span>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Steel Storm 2 will utilize the mighty idTech 4 GPL engine (the engine behind Doom 3 / Quake 4 / Prey / Wolfenstein / Brink ) and will be available for Linux and Windows, with a Mac release possible if enough funding is received. A release on Valve’s PC distribution store, Steam, has already been secured. A Fall 2013 release is planned.</div>
<p><img alt=""Steel"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1280.photobucket.com/albums/a484/DISHTY/ss2_sshot03_zps19aa3525.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div><strong>Fast flowing FPS:</strong></div>
<div>Infused with the ferocious pace of old school shooters, the meat of Steel Storm 2 is a chapter-based campaign across sprawling terrain accompanied by a harsh climate. Enemies come with various skills and need to be dealt with correctly and upon doing so you’ll witness the satisfaction of gibs! Big bosses, quests, key hunts, vehicular combat and plenty of weapons will keep you entertained from moment to moment.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Rich storyline:</strong></div>
<div>Taking on the role of Aurora, a former hovertank pilot turned natural resource scout, your calling for adventure sends you to a remote corner of the Warbird galaxy, on a remote ancient planet. During your journey you will discover many wonderful places, cool weapons, awaken an ancient alien race and face separatist Union’s General Bova with his ruthless minions. The story is told with cutscenes, NPC interaction and through finding relics from Aurora’s past that have a profound effect on her.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Chapter-based adventure:</strong></div>
<div>In order to mold the game as we hope and to ensure it appears on your monitors as soon as possible, we're releasing the game in four chapters. Think back to how Quake was separated into episodes and you’ll understand how this will function within the game. Releasing content in chapters also allows us to address feedback and tailor the game accordingly.</div>

<div><strong>Manga-influenced artstyle:</strong></div>
<div>Being fans of so many manga and their distinctive artstyle, it’s understandably making it across into Steel Storm 2. Specifically, we’re looking at Ghost in the Shell, Blood+, Afrosamurai, Appleseed and many other prominent animes for the majority of our art direction. These epics of their time serve as a great reference point for the game’s story too; which is charged high with emotion at times and is always action-packed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Modding support:</strong></div>
<div>Dedicating themselves to the project is a team of experienced Doom 3 modders using the idTech 4 GPL game engine. We’re keen to support the community and will do this by distributing the source code with the game as a part of the modding SDK, including all improvements to the game engine. This will allow much better modding capabilities than the previous Steel Storm game.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>4 player online co-op:</strong></div>
<div>Beat the game with up to four friends due to the online and LAN co-op capabilities. The aforementioned mod support is fully integrated with the co-op experience so when you’ve exhausted the campaign you can tweak gameplay to your liking, make your own levels and share new experiences with the global community.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Release on Steam: </strong></div>
<div>As with Steel Storm: Burning Retribution, the sequel will be available to purchase on Steam across all three supporting platforms if the funding comes in. Of course, this carries all the usual benefits of releasing a game through Steam - playing with your friends with ease and the update system making it easy to add the content we’ve got planned for the game as well.</div>

<h2><strong>Why IndieGoGo?</strong></h2>
</center>Steel Storm 2 is an ambitious project and we are only mortals living in this world as you are. It’s the game we’ve always dreamed about making and so we’re determined to ensure it comes to fruition as best as we can make it. I’ve personally been working on the game by myself for 6 months and that includes a meticulous 3 months of switching engines, from Darkplaces to idTech 4. At last, the game is starting to come together and so a number of collaborators have been brought in to supply art, additional programming and music. All of these people need to be paid for their fantastic work and there are a number of other costs that need to be met for the game to truly come to life.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So far I’ve funded Steel Storm 2 with the money made from Steel Storm: Burning Retribution but that pot has since become empty. Undoubtedly there’s still a while to go, which is why it’s high time to get stuck into development so we can share it with players as soon as possible! Ideally we would need some extra members to collaborate on the game and software to boost productivity, but primarily the funding will be used to create plenty of art assets and all of the levels required for the game.</div>
<p><img alt=""Steel Storm 2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1280.photobucket.com/albums/a484/DISHTY/sss2_zpsa52cc86d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>This is why we’ve come to IndieGoGo, with hopes that those interested will fund the game’s further progression and get involved as part of its surrounding community. To wrap it up more succinctly, here’s a quick breakdown as to how any money will be used:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Expanding the core team: </strong></div>
<div>Having the people already lined up to work on the game able to put their focus into it will make a huge difference to the quality and the speed at which we can get it on to your monitors. This includes:
<ul>
<li>2 game logic programmers</li>
<li>an engine programmer</li>
<li>2 artists</li>
<li>marketing/ PR</li>
</ul>
<strong>Contributing freelancers: </strong>
</div>
<div>As well as having a core team to work on the game, we’ll need to hire a few freelancers to fill in other parts of this audiovisual project. As in, we’ll be needing:
<ul>
<li>
<span>atmospheric music from </span><a href=""http://www.svengerlach.de/music.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sven Gerlach</a>
</li>

<li>
<span>voiceover for protagonist and NPCs from </span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/natalie-loftus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Natalie Loftus</a>
</li>
</ul>
Listen to the one of the music tracks from the Steel Storm 2 OST by Sven right here: <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/steel-storm-2/steel-storm-2-title-track"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/steel-storm-2/steel-storm-2-title-track</a>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>
<strong class=""intext_headers"">Software and Hardware:</strong> </div>
<div>While we utilize various open source tools in production, some tasks require proprietary software and additional hardware to achieve desireable results in timely fashion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<center>
<h2><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></h2>
</center>
<span> <img alt=""Apple Mac"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1280.photobucket.com/albums/a484/DISHTY/apple_zpsd8f5c719.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span>
</div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span> If we manage to accumulate extra funds, we will channel them to achieve the following goals:</span></div>
<h3>$105,000 - <strong class=""intext_headers"">Apple Mac OSX Release</strong>
</h3>
<div>
<span>Unfortunately we don't have the capabilities at the current moment in time to create a Mac version of Steel Storm 2 due to a lack of Apple's hardware and license. We definitely don't want to leave a whole player base out though, so are hoping to gain enough funds to make a Mac version possible.</span> </div>
<h3>$115,000 - <strong class=""intext_headers"">Steamworks support</strong>
</h3>
<p><span>Bringing up Steel Storm 2's magnitude is a challenge in itself. Adding comprehensive support for Steamworks to the GPL engine without violating the terms of the GPL license and Valve's SDA is also a challenge. Thankfully we have developed a way so solve this issue. However it will require the work of a programmer who has a deep knowledge of Steamworks.</span></p>

</div></div>","Remember Steel Storm: Burning Retribution? The top-down arcade shooter developed by Kot-in-Action Creative Artel? Apparently it was pretty good. Now try to imagine a sequel set within the same universe, but adapted into a first person shooter with old school gunplay in the spirit of Doom and Quake with added adventure elements and a rewarding story.
 
This is Steel Storm 2.
 
Yes, unlike the original game, Steel Storm 2 will combine vehicle and on-foot action so that players will experience a more engaging and diverse tale from behind the eyes of its protagonist. With your gun facing forward, prepare to head into an action-packed shooting frenzy with discoveries that will send emotions running high.
 


WTF Is Steel Storm 2?
Steel Storm 2 is a multi-faceted FPS experience. Imagine the breadth of Rage’s gameplay - the vehicular exploration and enemy extermination - but add a storyline that actually rewards you; something more in line with Halo and Darksiders. Now let’s sprinkle in some of the classic features of older shooters: carrying all weapons, no cover, lots of ammo, fast movement, and so on. The visual style is inspired by Ghost in the Shell anime, with a blend of Blood+, Afrosamurai and Appleseed to a degree.
 
Steel Storm 2 will utilize the mighty idTech 4 GPL engine (the engine behind Doom 3 / Quake 4 / Prey / Wolfenstein / Brink ) and will be available for Linux and Windows, with a Mac release possible if enough funding is received. A release on Valve’s PC distribution store, Steam, has already been secured. A Fall 2013 release is planned.

Fast flowing FPS:
Infused with the ferocious pace of old school shooters, the meat of Steel Storm 2 is a chapter-based campaign across sprawling terrain accompanied by a harsh climate. Enemies come with various skills and need to be dealt with correctly and upon doing so you’ll witness the satisfaction of gibs! Big bosses, quests, key hunts, vehicular combat and plenty of weapons will keep you entertained from moment to moment.
 
Rich storyline:
Taking on the role of Aurora, a former hovertank pilot turned natural resource scout, your calling for adventure sends you to a remote corner of the Warbird galaxy, on a remote ancient planet. During your journey you will discover many wonderful places, cool weapons, awaken an ancient alien race and face separatist Union’s General Bova with his ruthless minions. The story is told with cutscenes, NPC interaction and through finding relics from Aurora’s past that have a profound effect on her.
 
Chapter-based adventure:
In order to mold the game as we hope and to ensure it appears on your monitors as soon as possible, we're releasing the game in four chapters. Think back to how Quake was separated into episodes and you’ll understand how this will function within the game. Releasing content in chapters also allows us to address feedback and tailor the game accordingly.
 
Manga-influenced artstyle:
Being fans of so many manga and their distinctive artstyle, it’s understandably making it across into Steel Storm 2. Specifically, we’re looking at Ghost in the Shell, Blood+, Afrosamurai, Appleseed and many other prominent animes for the majority of our art direction. These epics of their time serve as a great reference point for the game’s story too; which is charged high with emotion at times and is always action-packed.
 
Modding support:
Dedicating themselves to the project is a team of experienced Doom 3 modders using the idTech 4 GPL game engine. We’re keen to support the community and will do this by distributing the source code with the game as a part of the modding SDK, including all improvements to the game engine. This will allow much better modding capabilities than the previous Steel Storm game.

Beat the game with up to four friends due to the online and LAN co-op capabilities. The aforementioned mod support is fully integrated with the co-op experience so when you’ve exhausted the campaign you can tweak gameplay to your liking, make your own levels and share new experiences with the global community.
 
Release on Steam: 
As with Steel Storm: Burning Retribution, the sequel will be available to purchase on Steam across all three supporting platforms if the funding comes in. Of course, this carries all the usual benefits of releasing a game through Steam - playing with your friends with ease and the update system making it easy to add the content we’ve got planned for the game as well.

 If we manage to accumulate extra funds, we will channel them to achieve the following goals:

We need YOUR help to create our GREATEST EXPERIENCE GAME YET! It's time to give you a platform to EXPERIENCE the East Coast of Australia through a new and EXCITING medium. 'The EXPERIENCE GAMES! T.O.L.A. (Bob Gammage) has toured AUSTRALIA extensively painting countless performers and shows but nothing will be as EXCITING as this!
We have made it to our first goal!
(The Artworks took 20 years to produce!)
5 Experience Games Tournament Card Decks

This project spanning 20 years, by the artist Bob Gammage, produced a body of over 1000 original artworks, known as Live Event Performance Artscapes. In the creation of each Artscape, he encouraged musicians, organizers, staff, tourists and those in attendance to add brushstrokes of colour to each canvas. All performance artworks evolved from blank to finished Artscape within the set time frame of the event. This was the birth of Theatre of Life Artistry.
Now you have the opportunity to be a part of this exciting project! 


The artist, Bob Gammage, became known as T.O.L.A.  Australia's foremost live event performance painter. 
We have also made it to our second goal!
Funding prior to our campaign allowed us to test the solidity of each component in the open market place. The card game, 'GIG CANCELLED',  has been widely accepted due to its variable player options.  We were able to produce five board game prototype templates and prepare all images, writings, poetry and layout for all five books. We have gratefully reached this goal through private funding and we would firstly like to thank the many investors who have assisted with their time and finances toward the complete creation of T.O.L.A.'s total concept.
Secondly, we can now offer you the opportunity to be a part of the EXPERIENCE Games and its Global Launch.
Now it's time to reach our third goal!
Creation of the interactive on-line tourism
tournament 'EXPERIENCE the Game'


This is where YOU CAN HELP.  When you pledge a PERK,  ""EXPERIENCE the Game' is one step closer to being launched globally. We have PERKS to suit any budget. They start from as little as $5.  If you love Musicians, pledge a PERK, if you love Artists, pledge a PERK, if you happen to live in Eumundi, 1770, Gympie, Tamworth or Windsor and you love your town, pledge a PERK; If you're a business owner in one of these locations and would like to see increased business in your town, pledge a PERK. The artist has made it his life's work to weave a tapestry, a memory of the lives and the events of the beautiful people whose paths he has crossed. His works included the brushstrokes of many of you throughout Australia and abroad; Performers and the general public alike. Perhaps even your brush strokes are part of this beautiful tapestry. Beyond this, you may be a perfect stranger who believes in what the artist has created and you too, can be a part of the tapestry by pledging a PERK to assist in the global launch. If you find you can't pledge a PERK, then please make a lot of noise and share our Indeigogo campaign; That will help too.

</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><b>Why The ChristWreath</b><br/>
During the Christmas season a number of years ago our pastor was lamenting that all
we see is Frosty, Rudolph and Santa....Secularism and the American Atheist
movement is being very effective in their war on Christmas.</p><p>The example below was a billboard placed in Time Square, N.Y. during the Christmas Season by the American Atheist Organization.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/965737/files/20141028082851-Scan0053.jpg?1414510131"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>To say this billboard is disturbing to all  Christians is an understatement.</p><p>I was moved to stop just talking about what should be done and to <i>DO SOMETHING</i> about it.<br/></p><p> While our Pastor continued I noticed a Cross adjacent to him and behind that a beautiful
Christmas wreath.  Hmm... Why not bring together the CROSS, the universal
symbol of Christ, and the Christmas  wreath, creating this NEW CHRISTMAS SYMBOL, the
ChristWreath, to serve as an affirmation of the <i>true</i> meaning of Christmas,
the birth of the Christ Child.</p>
<p>The ChristWreath will be a symbol of Christian Pride and what HIS values bring
to our lives, our country and the world.            Our NEW Christmas Symbol.</p><p>  <br/></p><p>   </p><p>                                                    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/977529/files/20141101115429-Small_Drawing_Christ_Wreath.jpg?1414868069"" src="""" style=""width: 199.336px; height: 300px;""/>                                                                                               </p><p>Most Christians place a round wreath on their home at Christmas.  How many

Isn't it time that <i>Christianity stand up for Jesus???   NOW is the time!!!<br/></i></p><p><i></i>There are over 240,000,000 Christians in America.  If only 10% embrace the
meaning of the ChristWreath, that means we have to produce and display 24,000,000 (that's
MILLION) ChristWreath products.  How many JOBS could we also create in America if we
had to manufacture 24,000,000 ChristWreath designed products.</p><p>We now have <i>Christian</i> Christmas gifts that bring the <i>Cross of Jesus  </i> into our Christmas Celebration.

</p><p><b><span></span></b><b>Who We Are</b></p><p>We are the Austin &amp; Kohuth Families and live in the Ft Pierce area of Fla., having moved here from the Northeast a number of years ago. <br/></p><p>We have become very disturbed as many of you have,in seeing how our country is gradually loosing its moral compass. </p><p>In stead of just complaining about it we have decided to take an active role and see if WE, all together as the Christian community,can make a difference.<br/></p><p>This has developed into a wonderful journey.  Having retired a number of
years ago I had not envisioned being at the threshold of a worthy mission as
well as helping create much needed jobs in America. <br/></p><p> My past business
experience was in helping to build independent insurance agencies in Northeast
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>We would love to have the ChristWreath be the start of an example of how
we can ALL help re-build AMERICA and provide individuals with additional
opportunities.</p>We are pleased that Indian River State College's Entrepreneurship Institute is
assisting as we move forward with our planning to help create jobs in America starting here in Ft. Pierce Florida. Saint Anastasia Church and the local Knights of Columbus is assisting in our
marketing initiative plan for Churches and Schools.  <br/><p>
Pastor Trevor Banks of the Resurrection Life Family Worship Center is the first
to be using the ChristWreath to be providing jobs in our  community by
manufacturing  ChristWreath designed products.<br/>
Our objective is that this will spread as a National Campaign across America.<br/><br/><b>Christian Pride and Unity</b><br/>
The ethics and moral values are badly broken in our country and in our world
today. <br/>
The degree of violence and brutality being exhibited throughout the world is
unimaginable.</p><p> Is it not time to have a re-birth of Christian Values? Is it not
time for Christians to join together to bring the Cross of Jesus as His symbol
of Peace and Love to the world?<br/> <br/>
Will YOU help?  If Not You...WHO?  If
Not Now...WHEN?<br/><br/>

Contributions to our campaign will be used to share the message of the New
Christmas Symbol... the ChristWreath... through the Marketing of the SYMBOL in order for it to become recognized throughout the USA and the World. <br/></p><p>The funds raised will be used to create Jobs in many ways.<br/></p><p>We will be using the funds to establish and enhance the entire E-Commerce network needed for the business. Customer Service, Marketing, fulfillment, Information Technology, ETC.<br/></p><p>Phase l: Whitney Wreath Co will handle the fulfillment needed . As demand dictates, additional locations will be introduced.<br/></p><p> Phase II :   To manufacture the ChristWreath here in Ft Pierce we will need to purchase many
things: <br/></p><p>
Wreath making machines, wreath rings, wreath greenery material, decorations,
packaging material, etc., injection plastic mold for plastic ChristWreath Symbol , machinery
to embroider hats with the ChristWreath logo, the ChristWreath Christmas
Jewelry Collection (necklace, earrings, bracelet, etc.)<br/>

</span></p></div>","Why The ChristWreath
During the Christmas season a number of years ago our pastor was lamenting that all
we see is Frosty, Rudolph and Santa....Secularism and the American Atheist
movement is being very effective in their war on Christmas.The example below was a billboard placed in Time Square, N.Y. during the Christmas Season by the American Atheist Organization.To say this billboard is disturbing to all  Christians is an understatement.I was moved to stop just talking about what should be done and to DO SOMETHING about it. While our Pastor continued I noticed a Cross adjacent to him and behind that a beautiful
Christmas wreath.  Hmm... Why not bring together the CROSS, the universal
symbol of Christ, and the Christmas  wreath, creating this NEW CHRISTMAS SYMBOL, the
ChristWreath, to serve as an affirmation of the true meaning of Christmas,
the birth of the Christ Child.
The ChristWreath will be a symbol of Christian Pride and what HIS values bring
to our lives, our country and the world.            Our NEW Christmas Symbol.                                                                                                                                                        Most Christians place a round wreath on their home at Christmas.  How many
would now display the ChristWreath on their home,                                                        or wear a beautiful ChristWreath Christmas Cross to
affirm their Pride in Christianity and support for Religious Freedom and Christian Family Values?              
Isn't it time that Christianity stand up for Jesus???   NOW is the time!!!There are over 240,000,000 Christians in America.  If only 10% embrace the
meaning of the ChristWreath, that means we have to produce and display 24,000,000 (that's
MILLION) ChristWreath products.  How many JOBS could we also create in America if we
had to manufacture 24,000,000 ChristWreath designed products.We now have Christian Christmas gifts that bring the Cross of Jesus   into our Christmas Celebration. Will YOU support this message? Keep Christ In Christmas-- Action requiredBring the Cross of Jesus, the ChristWreath, into our Christmas Celebration!Here are 3 easy things YOU can do to show your active support for this Mission( It truly will make a difference), go to our Web   www.ChristWreath.com and simply:1.

Display a ChristWreath design.Join us to show this is a strong CHRISTIAN country that supports Religious Freedom for ALL.This is OUR time to Celebrate HIS Birthday...It Is all about HIM...Will You Help?                                          If not You...WHO??                 If not NOW...When??Job Creation Opportunity--Become a ChristWreath Legacy PartnerHere is how YOU can also become an IMPORTANT part of our Mission to Keep Christ In Christmas NOW.  Come Join us and in addition to a wonderful Mission, YOU can also help create JOBS in the USA . Locate a manufacturers in YOUR geographic area to help create jobs locally..by manufacturing a ChristWreath Symbol product.Our goal is to introduce this New Christmas Symbol, the ChristWreath, to the USA and the World.  We need manufacturers in ALL states throughout the USA to be manufacturers of various ChristWreath designed products..

Help create jobs locally. Help support a Charity of your choice. BECOME a  CHRISTWREATH LEGACY PARTNER               A..... WIN....WIN....WIN.....Result      YOU can BE THE DIFFERENCE Our United States Patent and Trademark Office makes it work.Millions of artificial Christmas wreaths and Christmas decorations are imported from China every
year.  We Americans, unknowingly, send Billions of OUR  U.S. dollars to China
to manufacture 95% of our CHRISTMAS products for OUR CHRISTIAN
celebration.  Does this make economic sense? (And China is not a Christian
country)
We were elated when we were notified by the United States Patent and Trademark
Office that the ChristWreath has been granted a Design Patent, Trademark and a
Copyright for the ChristWreath design.                                                    With having a Design Patent we now have the opportunity to make the
ChristWreath, the NEW CHRISTMAS SYMBOL, a MADE IN THE USA product and help
create badly needed JOBS in America. China can NOT take this design,The ChristWreath, and bring it into the USA .Whitney Wreath Co, Whitneyville Maine, one of the largest wreath manufacturing companies in America, is manufacturing for us both the real and the artificial wreath. Roberto Arichi, Jewelry Designer, N.Y/L.A has created the beautiful ChristWreath Christmas Cross Collection.Others also are anxious to join them in manufacturing a ChristWreath designed product.
We are starting in Ft Pierce, Florida.
Pastor Trevor Banks  of the Resurrection Family Life Worship Center is helping to create a manufacturing company  to be a model for creating JOBS in a challenged community by manufacturing the ChristWreath and other ChristWreath Products..Our plan is to then take this model and
replicate it in other challenged communities throughout the USA. This is the
major project to which we are requesting your support. Help us create jobs here
and then share this model with other communities in America.
The ChristWreath ,the New Christmas Symbol, is like a two edged sword, not only
bringing a wonderful Christmas message, but also helping to create much needed
jobs in America.Fundraisers
We will work with Churches, Schools and other organizations  to use the
ChristWreath as a fundraiser to help support their various Youth,Family and other Ministries. Any organization is encouraged to use the ChristWreath and our new ChristWreath
Christmas Cross Jewelry Collection plus other ChristWreath designed products to
enhance their fundraising opportunity and share this New Christmas Symbol.

Who We AreWe are the Austin & Kohuth Families and live in the Ft Pierce area of Fla., having moved here from the Northeast a number of years ago. We have become very disturbed as many of you have,in seeing how our country is gradually loosing its moral compass. In stead of just complaining about it we have decided to take an active role and see if WE, all together as the Christian community,can make a difference.This has developed into a wonderful journey.  Having retired a number of
years ago I had not envisioned being at the threshold of a worthy mission as
well as helping create much needed jobs in America.  My past business
experience was in helping to build independent insurance agencies in Northeast
Pennsylvania.
We would love to have the ChristWreath be the start of an example of how
we can ALL help re-build AMERICA and provide individuals with additional
opportunities.We are pleased that Indian River State College's Entrepreneurship Institute is
assisting as we move forward with our planning to help create jobs in America starting here in Ft. Pierce Florida. Saint Anastasia Church and the local Knights of Columbus is assisting in our
marketing initiative plan for Churches and Schools.  
Pastor Trevor Banks of the Resurrection Life Family Worship Center is the first
to be using the ChristWreath to be providing jobs in our  community by
manufacturing  ChristWreath designed products.
Our objective is that this will spread as a National Campaign across America.Christian Pride and Unity
The ethics and moral values are badly broken in our country and in our world
today. 
The degree of violence and brutality being exhibited throughout the world is
unimaginable. Is it not time to have a re-birth of Christian Values? Is it not
time for Christians to join together to bring the Cross of Jesus as His symbol
of Peace and Love to the world? 
Will YOU help?  If Not You...WHO?  If
Not Now...WHEN?

<h4><b>the game</b></h4>
<div>
<b></b><p>Z-Horde takes
place in an apocalyptic scenario where an unknown disease is seizing every
human soul, turning them into blood thirsty and flesh hungry creatures.</p>
<p>But before you
had time to plan ahead a survival kit, you were infected! The cure is a mirage.
It is up to you to sit or fight back. </p>
<p>Take control over an army of zombies, each with special and unique  abilities. Lead them into the ultimate fight against what is left of mankind.
Do not expect mercy, humans are everywhere, ready to attack you at sight, still
believing they are the supreme race. </p>
<p>In this
real time strategy game, you lead an army of zombies in the hunting for every
human being left. Choose the right zombies, gather you hordes, play the right
ability, destroy every single enemy in the way and maybe you will have a chance
to live.</p>
<p>You already
know how it feels to be a human. It is time to try something better…</p>

<h4><b><b>what we need</b></b></h4>
<p>As you know, a product intended for commercial purposes must meet legal requirements. This means that for a game to be publish or distributed, it needs to comply with these legal obligations. </p>
<p>In order to accomplish these requirements we need your help! Licensing software is our next step as we have being developing the game with non-commercial licenses. Some of them are paid, even for non-commercial purposes. That is where we are standing.</p>
<p>Licensing software is our top priority. Commercial licenses are a big piece of this budget cake and without them one cannot publish this game nor future ones the way we are intended to.<br/>At the same time, we want to improve many aspects of the game.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>the goals</h4>
<p>We are committed to develop the game as far as possible. The list below presents all the improvements we are willing to achieve, depending on the funding available.</p>
<p>           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1032150/files/20141120071746-GoalsFinel3.png?1416496666"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><br/><b>Artificial Intelligence</b> – improve the way how playable and non-playable characters behave in the game, programming them to be more action-oriented instead of reaction-oriented, giving them a more realistic feel. This is a key topic in the development.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Animations</b> – improve animations to improve characters’ movements. In general, no one likes unsynchronized characters in games, we are no exception. We want to make our characters move smoothly and more accurate.</p>

</div></div>","short summary
Z-Horde is a 3D Real Time Strategy game for PC and Mac, about zombies fighting for a cause: human annihilation!


the game

Z-Horde takes
place in an apocalyptic scenario where an unknown disease is seizing every
human soul, turning them into blood thirsty and flesh hungry creatures.
But before you
had time to plan ahead a survival kit, you were infected! The cure is a mirage.
It is up to you to sit or fight back. 
Take control over an army of zombies, each with special and unique  abilities. Lead them into the ultimate fight against what is left of mankind.
Do not expect mercy, humans are everywhere, ready to attack you at sight, still
believing they are the supreme race. 
In this
real time strategy game, you lead an army of zombies in the hunting for every
human being left. Choose the right zombies, gather you hordes, play the right
ability, destroy every single enemy in the way and maybe you will have a chance
to live.
You already
know how it feels to be a human. It is time to try something better…

    



the team 


Arrow
Rooster’s team consists of five elements with backgrounds in Game Development Engineering
and Design. Z-Horde is our debut game project. 
At the
moment, Z-Horde is at pre-alpha stage. Almost all features are already
implemented and playable. The trailer is the product of the development stage
the game is in. Everything was accomplished with teamwork, personal effort,
time, know-how and fully developed with personal resources only. 

We are
committed to this project and believe that with help and better support we can
achieve a new step that allow us to bring our project and ideas to life.

the technology we are using





Unity is a
Game Engine, with full support for 2D and 3D game. It has a strong visual
component that helps in the creation and development of the game. It allows development
for PC, Mac, Linux, mobile platform and Web.
https://unity3d.com/




Mixamo is
software for rigging and animation of characters. In a matter of seconds you can
have any model full rigged and using a full pack of animations. It also has
face-rigging and pre-made characters (Humanoids and animals).
https://www.mixamo.com/



RAIN is a
Plugin for Unity, developed by RivalTheory. Its main purpose is simplifying the
creation of Artificial intelligence with the use of Behavior trees. It allows
any character to be fully controlled by an AI in minutes, for any game genre,
be it a FPS, RTS, RPG you name it.  
http://rivaltheory.com/rain/


what are the funds for






what we need
As you know, a product intended for commercial purposes must meet legal requirements. This means that for a game to be publish or distributed, it needs to comply with these legal obligations. 
In order to accomplish these requirements we need your help! Licensing software is our next step as we have being developing the game with non-commercial licenses. Some of them are paid, even for non-commercial purposes. That is where we are standing.
Licensing software is our top priority. Commercial licenses are a big piece of this budget cake and without them one cannot publish this game nor future ones the way we are intended to.At the same time, we want to improve many aspects of the game.


the goals
We are committed to develop the game as far as possible. The list below presents all the improvements we are willing to achieve, depending on the funding available.
           

Artificial Intelligence – improve the way how playable and non-playable characters behave in the game, programming them to be more action-oriented instead of reaction-oriented, giving them a more realistic feel. This is a key topic in the development.




Animations – improve animations to improve characters’ movements. In general, no one likes unsynchronized characters in games, we are no exception. We want to make our characters move smoothly and more accurate.



Scenarios - some maps will be at the dawn of the infection, others will be in a torn apocalyptic world. Expect a wide variety of landscapes, rural, industrial, urban, bridges, highways, secondary roads, and so on...









Characters – raise the amount of different playable and non-playable characters in order to avoid similarity among characters.

                                                                                                                                                            

                 


Supporters – YES! That is our final goal. Build a community that can support our games and be critical about them and we are totally available to answer your questions and doubts as well as any questions about the development of the game. This game is being built for you, therefore your opinion matters!

<h3>
<strong>Target:                    </strong>For all ages and also family target.</h3>
<h3>
<strong>Devices and OS:     </strong>It will be developed for tablets and                                 smartphones Android and Apple iOS.</h3>
<h3>""The babies"" is an entertainment video game for all ages</h3>
<p>The first ray of sunlight comes through the window, the baby wakes up and escapes from his crib because he is excited to start playing!</p>
<p>He's your baby and you'll have to take care of him, feed him, change him, wash him and play with him. If you are good enough, he'll become strong, handsome and, above all he will be happy.</p>
<p>You can customize your character in many different ways, choosing between a boy or a girl, changing his eyes color, hair style, skin type, dresses, accessories and much more.<br/> In advanced levels of the game you'll be able to make him look like a ""zombie"", a ""vampire"", a ""mummy"" or dress him like a ""fire-baby"",  a “stone-baby "": your fantasy is the limit.</p>
<p>You can interact with him directly with your fingers and even tickle him.</p>
<p>He's able to repeat what you say in a variety of intonations and if you play some music he'll dance for you with your favorite dance moves. When you are happy with his performance you can record it on a video and share it with your friends.</p>
<p>We believe it's important that the game design contains educational issues for children and we'll create some mini-games with that purpose.</p>
<p><img alt=""Portada"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://psychstudio.com/crowdfunding/portadafinal.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Portada""/></p>
<h2><strong>GAME DESIGN</strong></h2>
<h2>Module 1: Take care of him!</h2>
<p><br/> This part of the game is the one with all the interactivity with your Baby. You'll have to address him properly to make him grow up happy. The game develops day by day so that you can't neglect of him because he needs eating, he needs to keep clean and more important he needs to play with you.</p>
<p>Leveling up, means spreading the opportunities to customize your character by accessing to new clothes, costumes and other elements that will make the game funnier and unique.</p>

<h2><strong>Module 2: Mini-games.</strong></h2>
<p>Here are several baby-related games. You'll play and collect stars and chocolate coins that will be traded for clothing, food, and other cool stuff. The mini-games will allow you to proceed over the game levels and unlock new game options.</p>
<p>These mini-games are: a Parachute Jump arcade game, a Dive under the ocean exploring game, a Fly in the outer space distressing game. Also we will make some cool card games with an educational aim because, as we said, we believe it's important to  include an educational role in games for kids.</p>

<h2><strong>Module 3: Social Networks.</strong></h2>
<p>The game will integrate a live chat and an instant messaging module to share your experience with your friends.<br/> You can record your voice and make the baby send your message for you to one of your contacts.</p>
<p>If you play some music he will dance and you will also be able to use his animations clips in different contexts.<br/> Then you will share all of this with your friends over your favorite social networks.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Augmented Reality.</strong></h2>
<p>In a successive update we would like to implement augmented reality to integrate the Baby in real-time with your environment.</p>
<p>To make an example, if you play a song and make your Baby dance you can integrate him within a real scene with real persons using the camera of your device, record a video and create a live scene with a kind of choreography.</p>

Target:                    For all ages and also family target.

Devices and OS:     It will be developed for tablets and                                 smartphones Android and Apple iOS.
""The babies"" is an entertainment video game for all ages
The first ray of sunlight comes through the window, the baby wakes up and escapes from his crib because he is excited to start playing!
He's your baby and you'll have to take care of him, feed him, change him, wash him and play with him. If you are good enough, he'll become strong, handsome and, above all he will be happy.
You can customize your character in many different ways, choosing between a boy or a girl, changing his eyes color, hair style, skin type, dresses, accessories and much more. In advanced levels of the game you'll be able to make him look like a ""zombie"", a ""vampire"", a ""mummy"" or dress him like a ""fire-baby"",  a “stone-baby "": your fantasy is the limit.
You can interact with him directly with your fingers and even tickle him.
He's able to repeat what you say in a variety of intonations and if you play some music he'll dance for you with your favorite dance moves. When you are happy with his performance you can record it on a video and share it with your friends.
We believe it's important that the game design contains educational issues for children and we'll create some mini-games with that purpose.

GAME DESIGN
Module 1: Take care of him!
 This part of the game is the one with all the interactivity with your Baby. You'll have to address him properly to make him grow up happy. The game develops day by day so that you can't neglect of him because he needs eating, he needs to keep clean and more important he needs to play with you.
Leveling up, means spreading the opportunities to customize your character by accessing to new clothes, costumes and other elements that will make the game funnier and unique.
  
Module 2: Mini-games.
Here are several baby-related games. You'll play and collect stars and chocolate coins that will be traded for clothing, food, and other cool stuff. The mini-games will allow you to proceed over the game levels and unlock new game options.
These mini-games are: a Parachute Jump arcade game, a Dive under the ocean exploring game, a Fly in the outer space distressing game. Also we will make some cool card games with an educational aim because, as we said, we believe it's important to  include an educational role in games for kids.

Module 3: Social Networks.
The game will integrate a live chat and an instant messaging module to share your experience with your friends. You can record your voice and make the baby send your message for you to one of your contacts.
If you play some music he will dance and you will also be able to use his animations clips in different contexts. Then you will share all of this with your friends over your favorite social networks.
 
Augmented Reality.
In a successive update we would like to implement augmented reality to integrate the Baby in real-time with your environment.
To make an example, if you play a song and make your Baby dance you can integrate him within a real scene with real persons using the camera of your device, record a video and create a live scene with a kind of choreography.

<p dir=""ltr""><em><strong>For those who hate fun:</strong> Questria: Princess Destiny is Life Simulation Game for all age groups. Similar to the Princess Maker series; Princess Destiny will immerse you in the hectic world of growing up as a princess in waiting in a magical kingdom. With 60 Ending variations, character customisation as well as accommodating various play styles, Questria: Princess Destiny will surely satisfy many tastes. The game is PG (About the same entry level you would let your kid watch Who Framed Roger Rabbit)</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>We have spent tons of time and effort on crafting this game and with your pledges and our hard work we can bring the game to you and the rest of the world.</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>The game breaks up into 2 major components. Increasing your stats through daily activities and interacting socially with the residents of Questria. Discover how well you did and what you eventually become on your 20th birthday.</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>In case you weren’t paying attention: You do not directly control the main character in Questria: Princess Destiny. Instead you play as Sirelestia, ruler of Questria; you enact policies and decrees to help guide the princess-in-waiting’s choices. If you are too soft she’ll become lazy and belligerent. If you are too hard she’ll become resentful and perhaps even run away! (from your lame-ass)</em></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><em>This project is set to flexible funding. If we do not hit the 60k goal we will collect and use all funds collected to compensate those who worked on the demo. We will then collaborate with all supporters to get better direction on re-launching or redirecting the project.</em></p>

News & Updates: Considering this legal advice; Questria: Princess Destiny will now employ humor and make commentary based on the brony culture and My Little Pony to be considered under Fair Use. This would thrust the game into the same level of commentary that you have been accustomed to with Spaceballs, Garbage Pail Kids, Mad Magazine and EgoRaptor cartoons.

The project is very near funding end, final funding cost it is still possible! That said, alternatives to fully funded project will be discussed once the project expires;   will want to hear from all of you on how to proceed forward on future projects.
You can read more on this decision here

For those who hate fun: Questria: Princess Destiny is Life Simulation Game for all age groups. Similar to the Princess Maker series; Princess Destiny will immerse you in the hectic world of growing up as a princess in waiting in a magical kingdom. With 60 Ending variations, character customisation as well as accommodating various play styles, Questria: Princess Destiny will surely satisfy many tastes. The game is PG (About the same entry level you would let your kid watch Who Framed Roger Rabbit)
We have spent tons of time and effort on crafting this game and with your pledges and our hard work we can bring the game to you and the rest of the world.
The game breaks up into 2 major components. Increasing your stats through daily activities and interacting socially with the residents of Questria. Discover how well you did and what you eventually become on your 20th birthday.
In case you weren’t paying attention: You do not directly control the main character in Questria: Princess Destiny. Instead you play as Sirelestia, ruler of Questria; you enact policies and decrees to help guide the princess-in-waiting’s choices. If you are too soft she’ll become lazy and belligerent. If you are too hard she’ll become resentful and perhaps even run away! (from your lame-ass)
Supergamedev is proud present Questria: Princess Destiny as its first official game. A collaboration of talented folks including game designers, artists, coders and sound engineers who’ve come together to create a truly lovable and endearing experience.
If you don’t have the funds to help out the project you can always share and announce it to others. A grass-roots campaign will really help push the games final deliverable to where we all want it to be!
This project is set to flexible funding. If we do not hit the 60k goal we will collect and use all funds collected to compensate those who worked on the demo. We will then collaborate with all supporters to get better direction on re-launching or redirecting the project.

</h3> <p>The newest specialised simulator games might seem hip with their lack of gameplay, story, characters or sanity but they are seriously flawed. They don't have enough replayability or true open sandbox feeling (not even that Sandbox Simulator garbage...).<br/></p>We decided to create the one true simulator where the phrase ""The only limit is your imagination"" is not just some marketing lie but the real core element. Our great game, the Empty Space Simulator 2014 will let you use your imagination to the fullest of its potential or even beyond!<br/><br/>With Empty Space Simulator 2014 nothing gets in the way of your imagination! you can imagine your own character(s), NPCs, enemies, scenery, missions, endgame content or even the achievements. With proper experience (80-90 hours by our experts calculations) you'll be able to use your imagination outside of the game just by staring at walls or closing your eyes.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/682035/files/20140629063644-ES1080p.jpg?1404049004"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The tutorial can be useful after all the hand-holding of modern games, but can be skipped if you ever read a book and enjoyed it<br/><br/><h3>Outstanding features </h3><p>We are sure the general idea is enough for your generous support but here are some real industry-unique features just to brag about them.</p> <ul>
<li>Seamless gameplay without any on screen info or even start menu, so nothing breaks your fun.</li>
<li>Co-op with Skype, mobile or landline support.<br/>
</li>
<li>Free DLC in the future, no Season Pass needed ever.<br/>

 The newest specialised simulator games might seem hip with their lack of gameplay, story, characters or sanity but they are seriously flawed. They don't have enough replayability or true open sandbox feeling (not even that Sandbox Simulator garbage...).We decided to create the one true simulator where the phrase ""The only limit is your imagination"" is not just some marketing lie but the real core element. Our great game, the Empty Space Simulator 2014 will let you use your imagination to the fullest of its potential or even beyond!With Empty Space Simulator 2014 nothing gets in the way of your imagination! you can imagine your own character(s), NPCs, enemies, scenery, missions, endgame content or even the achievements. With proper experience (80-90 hours by our experts calculations) you'll be able to use your imagination outside of the game just by staring at walls or closing your eyes.The tutorial can be useful after all the hand-holding of modern games, but can be skipped if you ever read a book and enjoyed itOutstanding features We are sure the general idea is enough for your generous support but here are some real industry-unique features just to brag about them. 
Seamless gameplay without any on screen info or even start menu, so nothing breaks your fun.
Co-op with Skype, mobile or landline support.

Free DLC in the future, no Season Pass needed ever.

The first unit will be quantit city (Gron), where they are incurred. Basic color distribution will be black/red. Pure survival gameplay (you can die... almost everywhere). Another place will be the nature. Black stays (like everywehre else) and there will be green instead of red. The gameplay in the nature will be based on your perception.

It opens without Flash Player!Why do we play games? The reason is simple, games are the funniest and most widely used method of interactive entertainment. For our generation, this is an excessivly used method to enjoy ourselves. In our age, every child that played at least one game dreamt about creating their own. We are beginning to fulfill this dream - and when it comes to interactivity directly in our game, we introduce new and creative methods of interactivity. Do not expect a perfect game without flaws, but an independent experimental project. So - boil a cup of coffee, sit down and think twice if you entrust us your money and we will try our hardest to reward you for doing so.Kopula is not a game. It is only a half of the game, the second half (The Cube) we will create later. Why is it that we show you the concept of only a half of the game? Because half of the game is the game itself. We will try to explain it. Choose any game and divide it into 2 parts. Both part seem as absolutely different games, but everything is connected seamlessly. Does it seem impossible? Maybe. And therefore, we want to make it possible! We are creating a new kind of interactivity. The game we are making is very similar, yet very different.Kopula is a 2D point-and-click survival adventure, where you have to find out how to get rid of the virus in a robot called BA-ET, who is also the protagonist. The story is taking part in two cities and the countryside around. In this way, the game will be divided into three basic color palletes and playable units. The first unit will be quantit city (Gron), where they are incurred. Basic color distribution will be black/red. Pure survival gameplay (you can die... almost everywhere). Another place will be the nature. Black stays (like everywehre else) and there will be green instead of red. The gameplay in the nature will be based on your perception. The last place will be kind of quality city (Urubnia) where the black mixes with blue. In this part you will need to think logically (there will be lots of puzzles around). We assume that the game will have 5-10 story levels,  if all goes according to plan. The game should have 5+ hours of game time.As i have already said, the game will work mainly with black color. Black is the basis of everything in this game; items, characters, everything will be black and the contrast will create just the background and effects. And subtitles of course, will be white. For the items, we chose to be minimalistic. Therefore, do not expect perfectly sculpted and detailed items, the graphics won’t look godlike (yet). The graphic style is related to the level design.Each level will contain several rooms. Each room will have an edgy, colored background with black walls interactive objects will break the aesthetics of the room (look at the picture in section Future, there is a room showcasing the effect). We have divided items into two categories. The main items, that are required to solve the puzzle in the room, and the side items, which will create effects in the background, so the room doesn’t feel so empty. When you finish the room, you move to the next room, which is usually harder and more complicated than the previous. When you finish all of them, on to the next level you go!You can collect letters and objects, that will inform you about the world, achievement hunters won’t go empty-handed either, the arms of a robot are in your hands. The game is literally stuffed with achievements, as well as easter eggs. Letters will also contain codes for bonus levels and some texts with pictures. The bonus level will be closely related to the topic. In some letters you will also find cure against antiviruses in the robot’s body. But now we get to the basic principle on which our game works. It's the best for last.Viruses in your body will attack by different means and functions, trying to sabotage the you in the nastiest way possible. Antivirus will be necessary to have the virus expelled from the system. Here is an example. If the puzzle of the room you are in is sight oriented, the viruses will try to hinder your sight, if you need sounds, your hearing sensors will be the target. While it may not exactly seem 4D, it will be made so you feel every change in BA-AT’s perception to the fullest possible extent. + Special graphic style combination of black and shades. + Interactive gameplay and restrictive virus attack. + Several specific music genres. + Help bar with main and secondary tasks and Ba-et's feelings. + A lot of (brutal) achievements... + Easter eggs. + Special and bonus levels. + Interesting minigames and puzzles. + Interactive environment. + Billions and billions of humorous and trolling subtitles/texts. + Probably interesting dubbing (in Czech and English). + A lot of other features that will be announced soon!Sounds are another part of the game. We especially focused on sound effects. There will be none. Say goodbye to sounds as you know them, every single one will be portrayed via musical instruments. Dripping water? How about a soft, jazzy piano? Explosion? More like dubstep bass. We tried to reach out to the gamers that like challenge, but also those, who enjoy unique design. We tried to mix multiple music genres together, so they will not make your heads explode, and also not to feel repetitive. You won’t hear the same music twice, and no sound will sound as you would expect it to.And one more important thing. Music in our game feels robotic. It's just a Kopula ""style"", so do not expect orchestral machine will play orchestral music etc. Just experimental Kopula. M'kay?After Kopula, we will go on to make the second game of the Linked Pack project, The Cube. We said that we want to make an interactive game, and we decided to split it into two parts. We’re gonna finish the second part, and hop onto next stuff, we would like to make a project every half a year or so. We’re trying to set a solid ground in the gaming industry, and make games that people want based on feedback given by the fanbase. We want to stay independent and true to the core, keeping the games we make likable and wanted. For us, it is a dream we want to realize, and we want you to live it with us.And who are we exactly? We’re just two guys working on the Linked Pack project, trying to break through. Dominik “DarknesS” Gottwald (design, sound and somewhat of a moneygrabber). Art student, has done some projects previously, so he’s no stranger. DarknesS is a great, capable, dependent-ish person. The second fellow is Jakub ""Kubeeš"" Profota (graphics designer, script writer and a madman). High school student. This is his debut in the industry, so he hopes to shine. Kubeeš is the kind of guy who works only when he wants to, but when he does, he gets the job done. DomBee Softworks was estabilished in late 2013, and since that time were thinking about the project we wanted to create. Since Kubeeš is well versed in Flash scripting, we decided to utilize it in the game. We’ve been working on Kopula since February 2014. That is all you need to know about us for now, we would like our games to speak on our behalf.What happens if we get more money than we ask for? The game will take a turn for the better. The main stretch goal is 500 dollars. If we get this amount, the game will be finished in a years time. We will also make a webpage and a domain, and invest more time in social networking to listen to your feedback. We will also put some money to advertising, and turn to Steam Greenlight if everything goes smoothly. The main stretch, will be used for everything listed above, the game will be finished as intended. For a 1000 dollars we will finish the second part of the Linked Pact, The Cube, without delay. We will also design Kopula for Android and iOS, and make custom mouse cursors for PC! If we get here, the quality will rise tenfold. The game will be much more detailed and polished, we will get singers for the music to add variety, try to enhance the experience as much as we can. And don’t get us started about The Cube. The concept is still in diapers, so to speak, but this could lead to something much bigger than we intended.Kopula can react in two impressions - art or madness.

The device stands for a simple but convincing technical approach to be able to dive into Virtual Reality: You use the processing power and the display of your smartphone instead of implementing electronics into a VR headset (like the Oculus Rift). You start the application on your smartphone, insert into the headset, adjust the lenses – and you are done.   With our optional bluetooth controller, you will have absolute control over your VR experience.</span></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>The basic idea is that Virtual Reality should become available for many people without a barrier – after all, most of us already have the “core” in our pocket: our Android or Apple smartphone.  The 4REAL3D works with Android or iOS smartphones that have a gyroscope, accelerometer, and up to 5 inch screen.  4REAL3D compatible apps and games can be found on our website, Google Play Store, Youtube, or just by searching online for SBS standard video or Google Cardboard apps.</span></p>

</div></div>","The Worlds Best $25 Hands-Free Virtual Reality 3D Headset for Smartphones.



The 4REAL3D is the world’s best Virtual Reality headset for consumers - for less than the cost of 2 movie tickets. The device stands for a simple but convincing technical approach to be able to dive into Virtual Reality: You use the processing power and the display of your smartphone instead of implementing electronics into a VR headset (like the Oculus Rift). You start the application on your smartphone, insert into the headset, adjust the lenses – and you are done.   With our optional bluetooth controller, you will have absolute control over your VR experience.
The basic idea is that Virtual Reality should become available for many people without a barrier – after all, most of us already have the “core” in our pocket: our Android or Apple smartphone.  The 4REAL3D works with Android or iOS smartphones that have a gyroscope, accelerometer, and up to 5 inch screen.  4REAL3D compatible apps and games can be found on our website, Google Play Store, Youtube, or just by searching online for SBS standard video or Google Cardboard apps.

<p>Maybe due to the recent absurd events in Ukraine, or maybe due to the August 2008 Russian aggression in Georgia, we somehow feel the biggest enemy of today's world peace is Vladimir Putin So we decided to create a game called Putin-A.</p>
<p>But we think the problem lies not only in Vladimir, son of a...nother Vladimir. Counter actions taken by other leaders are usually far from effective. Maybe they were not brave enough, maybe they didn't see this coming, or maybe they are asses themselves - matters of debate. </p>
<p>By this game we would like to show that Putin-A is willing to put an end to the peace and freedom and it's up to the other leaders whether he succeeds or not.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Concept</h3> <p></p>
<p>The game-play will be made up of three steps: Kick, Flight and Fight. </p>
<p>We start the game by kicking Putin-A with a giant foot, who then goes to a flight mode. After the unpleasant landing he confronts the local leader. It's up to the player how the local leader reacts and so it's up to the user who's going to win. </p>

The Kick


Putin-A is ready to start
The giant foot is rotating

The player must touch the screen to fix the rotating foot and define the strength of the kick. 
The kick is immediately followed by the flight. 


The Flight

Now the player can sit back and enjoy the flight. Stronger the kick, longer the flight.
During this step we fly over all the locations we would have reached by a weaker kick and eventually start falling.


The Fight

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">The Reflow Master Shield from Paladin Enabling Technologies is an Arduino shield that turns your normal toaster oven into a reflow oven. A reflow oven is used in the production of electronics to change solder paste from a paste form to a liquid form and lastly to a solid form. This results in all your components being soldered for you in one run.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">But let me share with you why I've created the Reflow Master Shield and why you would want one.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In 2012 I created my first project and I wanted to upgrade the project but soon realized that I required surface mount devices or components (SMD) to be able to do so.</span></p>
<p>The industry standard these days are to use SMD to populate boards. As you will notice from some of the following commercial boards:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/923719/files/20141012030704-Industry_Standard.png?1413108424"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>Yes we can still make use of through hole components but their SMD cousins are often more feature rich and comes in at a more affordable price. Component sizes are also reduced which enables you to create a smaller circuit board which once again saves you money.</div><div><br/></div><div>These facts lead me to get hold of a reflow oven controller.<br/> 
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I looked to purchase a model but didn't find a model that suited my needs and so I set out to create my own. The Reflow Master Shield is what I came up with. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/923722/files/20141012031102-Reflow_Master_Shield1.png?1413108662"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It is an Arduino shield that is cross compatible with the Arduino UNO and the Arduino MEGA. The user interface have been designed to be user friendly and feature rich. </span></p>
<p>You are able to store your profiles and completely customize it as you would like to. This in other words doesn't limit you to reflow soldering. If you wanted to, you could use it to cook food, reflow solder or to powder coat metals. The shield enables you to have a stand alone unit that doesn't need a computer to run the show.</p>

<p>The unit is designed to operate with a normal mechanical

<p>From left to right, my own DIY relay board, a Solid State Relay

<p>I have also insured that the temperature measurement of the unit is accurate. I've used a ISO traceable calibration rig to do so. This means that your measured temperature is very accurate.<br/></p>

<br/>
I've also implemented a hysteresis functionality which enables the user to use any toaster oven to do the job. The hysteresis functionality prevents the unit from going into limbo if your PID parameters aren't set correctly.

Shield 
The Reflow Master Shield from Paladin Enabling Technologies is an Arduino shield that turns your normal toaster oven into a reflow oven. A reflow oven is used in the production of electronics to change solder paste from a paste form to a liquid form and lastly to a solid form. This results in all your components being soldered for you in one run.
But let me share with you why I've created the Reflow Master Shield and why you would want one.
In 2012 I created my first project and I wanted to upgrade the project but soon realized that I required surface mount devices or components (SMD) to be able to do so.
The industry standard these days are to use SMD to populate boards. As you will notice from some of the following commercial boards:

Yes we can still make use of through hole components but their SMD cousins are often more feature rich and comes in at a more affordable price. Component sizes are also reduced which enables you to create a smaller circuit board which once again saves you money.These facts lead me to get hold of a reflow oven controller. 
I looked to purchase a model but didn't find a model that suited my needs and so I set out to create my own. The Reflow Master Shield is what I came up with. 



It is an Arduino shield that is cross compatible with the Arduino UNO and the Arduino MEGA. The user interface have been designed to be user friendly and feature rich. 
You are able to store your profiles and completely customize it as you would like to. This in other words doesn't limit you to reflow soldering. If you wanted to, you could use it to cook food, reflow solder or to powder coat metals. The shield enables you to have a stand alone unit that doesn't need a computer to run the show.

Connections:




The unit is designed to operate with a normal mechanical
relay, a relay module (Using a high level trigger) or a solid state relay
(SSR). 


From left to right, my own DIY relay board, a Solid State Relay
and a relay module using a high level trigger.
I've managed to work through various prototype stages until I was happy with the final design. Here are the first official prototype after about 4 revisions

I have also insured that the temperature measurement of the unit is accurate. I've used a ISO traceable calibration rig to do so. This means that your measured temperature is very accurate.





I've also implemented a hysteresis functionality which enables the user to use any toaster oven to do the job. The hysteresis functionality prevents the unit from going into limbo if your PID parameters aren't set correctly.



Paladin Enabling Technologies need yours help!
 The Reflow Master Shield have been designed, developed, prototyped and tested. I have a few boards ready to be sent out but I need your help to be able to provide larger quantities at an affordable price.
What you'll receive is the following:



Reflow Master Shield


Graphic LCD module


Awesome stickers 


Type K thermocouple.




What you'll need to provide:


Arduino Uno or Arduino MEGA


Relay module or Solid state relay


Toaster oven


Hacked extension cord. (Make your own - link)


Wiring of the shield to a relay module or to a solid state relay:



Here is a little video demonstrating how a Reflow Master Shield is put together.

  Risks & Challenges This was my first really big Arduino project and I've learnt everything as I went along. I must admit that when I started this project I thought that it would take me 6 months at the most - haha (So I learnt how to realisticly set goals). 
Being new to the Arduino enviroment, it took considerably longer than that. I started the project back at the beginning of 2013 and steadily made progress. I also learnt a lot about Eagle CAD and how to have PCBs produced etc.
There is a risk of being over funded but I foresee that I will be able to cope with demand. I will be able to outsource production should demand exceed expectations.

<p>We're making (actually we're close to finish) a cool shooting&amp;racing multiplayer game inspired by the old-school Grand Theft Auto 2 game which some of you might still remember. We really loved playing it so we decided to make something similar but better :). Here comes Street Arena!</p>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need a little extra money to finish our hobby project. Its main problem has always been that we're both programmers so the artistic side has been lacking. Now, after 6 years of development we finally want to release the game but before we do so, we would like to polish it by hiring professional artists to create some more assets, that is meshes and, in particular, animations.</p>

<p></p></div>","Hello guys,
I have been working on the development of KRUM - hack'n slash, action adventure game, for more than 5 years.  However, what is important now for finishing and polishing the game is funding.
I'm using Blender and Blender Game Engine as a development tool.The community there have been fantastic in giving great ideas and useful source of information for my endeavor. That is why I have decided to start this campaign to fund the last couple of stages of the game , and I'll be grateful if you support this project!

It's a third-person, single-player action game. KRUM has medieval settings, with some fantasy elements. I hope, it will be notable for its high-speed realistic, 1 to 1 combats, and remarkable gameplay.

You are a noble man living in a small and peaceful village.One day you return from the forest with some woods and see your village ravaged in ruins. Your friends and family dead or taken in slavery. One of the few survivors, was able to tell you what happened in his last moments:Unknown demon forces came and destroyed everything without a reason, taking away the ones you love.
There is no other way for you but, go in a quest for saving them...
As you progress in your path, you realize that there is something more, something bigger, something terrifying behind this.


KRUM has a unique combat system that is simple to learn but tricky to master that’s unlike almost any other action video game out there. It’s nothing like a click-and-slash button masher. Button mashing will get you only killed. Each weapon has only a handful of simple to execute and yet brutal combos. The nature of the fights means that you’ll often be waiting your turn and planning your timing, whether that’s to strike or parry or roll out of the way.The game, in other words, leans heavily toward action, but because combat is so perilous and gritty you'll often find yourself in what feels like a stand-off, whether battling monsters or common warriors, waiting with some trepidation for your “turn.”But what is said is said, see it for your self.
Here are some of the enemies you will encounter in the game





































And many more...

Making game from scratch, all by my self is not an easy task.
This project is my passion and the time I put in it, is the most valuable thing I've done in my life.
I need to raise €5,000 so I can finish the last world(""The Wastelands"") and polish the other ones. If I'm able to get a few more enemies created within that budget, I'll be more than happy.
Check the perks to the right to see what you'll get in return for helping me out.
The game will be available for :Steam will be available if we get greenlit.(So help me out there)
It will be great, If I have the opportunity to create one or two more unique worlds, entire races of monsters and demons and create arena type multiplayer mode.Here's how the money will be spend:

Game polishing and features(Optimization/GUI/Sound/Music)  

Additional enemy models and animations
Additional environment and new level designs
Multiplayer feature+server fees/New arenas made exclusively for this mode
Mac & Linux support
Translation of the game by professionals
Indiegogo/Paypal fees
Taxes 
Website, Greenlight, Marketing..
Me drinking a lot of beer!

That is exactly, for what I will use the excess money.Thank you!

<p><span>We are SuperSaga Studios and we want to do the impossible – with your help!</span></p>
<p><span>We created a great mobile game, Heroes &amp; Havoc, at our last job. The game came out on iPhone and iPad and was off to a great start, but the studio closed two days after our worldwide launch.</span></p>
<p><span>That just wouldn’t do.</span></p>
<p><span>The game’s destiny needs to be in the hands of its fans. So a few of us that built the game purchased it and are breathing life back into it. Heroes &amp; Havoc lives!</span></p>
<p><span>Now we’re SuperSaga, and you can join us on our mission! The Ten Houses of Havoc will be restored. The epic story of our world will be told through the Tales, Legends, and Sagas of all our Heroes. We will reveal to you ALL of the Ultimate Ascensions and allow players to craft each Hero’s path. And completion of Tales, Legends, and Sagas will unlock a new kind of Ultimate Ascension – Mythics!</span></p>
<p><span>Best of all, this is just the beginning. We are adding more Heroes! We’re adding Havoc to the world! We’re adding events! We’re going to create the best card battle experience the world has ever known.</span></p>
<p><span>And who are we? We’re super experienced game vets. We’re not employees – we’re a crew. We don’t have jobs – we have a mission. And we don’t just want to make games – we want to make history.</span></p>

<p>SuperSaga needs funding to build out the the world of Heroes &amp; Havoc. Your contributions bring us closer to the game as we have always imagined it, with all ten houses, a story for every Hero, the ability to craft your Hero’s path, multi-player events, Angels that can be recruited to your cause, and expansions that tell even bigger tales. </p>
<p>Help us keep the development effort alive! We’ve done the early heavy lifting. The game is live now and you can play it on your iOS device. But it contains just a tiny fraction of the stories, Heroes, and Houses we’ve designed. Wait till you see the fighters of Alroc and Unduur! </p>

<p>The Heroes of Malakai are the keepers of peace in the world of Havoc. These warrior priests are masters of healing and supressing conflict. As followers of Malakai, the God of Life, they lead monastic lives and forsake all worldy possessions to pursue the study of Malakai’s Laws.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The Heroes of Kulrath are the bringers of death and destruction. They are more beast than man and celebrate their God by rampaging through Havoc, leaving only corpses and ruin in their wake. Kulrath, the God of Destruction, then descends from the sky in the form of thousands of vultures and feeds on the remains of their slaughter.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The Heroes of Isha are the keepers of ancient secrets. They reside deep in the forests of Havoc and ruthlessly hunt down any who would seek to disturb their reclusive existence.

The Heroes of Isha are rarely seen, and those who catch a glimpse of their lithe forms in the moonlight are never heard from again.</p>

<p>The Heroes of Tsadiki are wild harbingers of change. They are highly evolved beings that consider other life forms to be inadequate attempts at perfection. Their shape shifting goddess Tsadiki never takes the same form twice and relentlessly seeks to perfect her biological creations. Her followers are able to adapt to any situation, evolving at alarming rates to match and overcome those lesser beings that would threaten their Mistress’s pursuits.</p>

<p>We’ve built dozens of web and mobile games, from the Kaijudo Trading Card Game for Wizards of the Coast, to award-winning games like Oasis, Resurrection, and Alien Logic. And these aren’t awards like “best intro sequence” either - they’re international awards for Game of the Year, Best Game Design of the Year, Strategy Game of the Year, etc. We’re pros who want to make a difference and give gamers what they crave – decisions that matter in a game THEY love.</p>

The Heroes of Isha are rarely seen, and those who catch a glimpse of their lithe forms in the moonlight are never heard from again.
 
House Tsadiki


The Heroes of Tsadiki are wild harbingers of change. They are highly evolved beings that consider other life forms to be inadequate attempts at perfection. Their shape shifting goddess Tsadiki never takes the same form twice and relentlessly seeks to perfect her biological creations. Her followers are able to adapt to any situation, evolving at alarming rates to match and overcome those lesser beings that would threaten their Mistress’s pursuits.
 
Coming Soon:
 
House Alroc

 
House Unduur

 
But that's not all...
In addition to adding new Houses and Heroes to the game, we are also making some MAJOR enhancements to gameplay and bringing limited-time, exclusive content to the players.
Your contributions will help us:

Add House Alroc and his four dwarven Heroes
Add House Unduur and his deadly toys
Build the campaigns and stories for every Hero in your collection. Each will have a Tale, a Legend, and a Saga that, upon completion, will unlock a new class of Ultimate Ascensions: Mythics!
Add the Ultimate Ascension screen that allows players to see each Hero’s path and sculpt it to their liking.
 
If we reach our funding goal, we'll even be able to add an ongoing Gauntlet event, with a chance to earn weekly prizes and rare battlers unlike ANY OTHER!
 

 
All of the passion is bottled up and ready to be unleashed on all of this and more. The crew has chosen to stick it out to make this game the greatest Card Battle RPG in history. We’ve worked on our own dime and need money to fund operations. That means server costs and paying these fine vets enough to buy their allotment of soup and crackers. Yes, the game is its own reward except for the food and rent and stuff we all have to pay.
Your contributions will help us breathe new life into our dream project, and will grant you the chance to enjoy the fruit of our labors (with extra fruit, of course). If we reach our funding goal, we’ll even sweeten the deal by opening up new perk tiers, including exclusive H&H-themed physical goods!
This isn’t just a game we’re building – it’s an adventure, and it includes YOU. 
 

Your contribution puts the team back in the game development saddle instead of under the yoke of consulting or a regular employment. We’re not lazy. We’re not too good for jobs. We just know the awesomeness that lies within this game and we’re not too proud to ask for your help to keep working to make it as great as it can be.
We’ve built dozens of web and mobile games, from the Kaijudo Trading Card Game for Wizards of the Coast, to award-winning games like Oasis, Resurrection, and Alien Logic. And these aren’t awards like “best intro sequence” either - they’re international awards for Game of the Year, Best Game Design of the Year, Strategy Game of the Year, etc. We’re pros who want to make a difference and give gamers what they crave – decisions that matter in a game THEY love.
We lost our jobs and have one chance to make it right for the game. Help give us this chance and we’ll give back to you with our hard work and great gameplay.
 

You can access the early iOS release build via iTunes here. The Android version is COMING SOON!
 
 
Don't have a smartphone that can access the game? Check out the game's intro movie for the backstory on YouTube, instead!  
 
 
 

Love what we’re doing but can’t contribute? No problem! You can still help us by spreading the word and raising awareness for the game. We appreciate all the help we can get - however big or small.
Happy playing from the team at SuperSaga – now go slay some Orcs!",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Arsiz is a
company known as a pioneer in the intergalactic travels fields. It has
discovered an amazing new concept in connections of resources between the 11
planets with habitants. This way Arsiz became the most valuable and powerful
patrimony of Krysa.  Krysa, is the
organization that has the political and military domain over 7 planets, being the
largest and bigger state in 972 nations, among 6 planetary systems. After the
recognition of the big improvement this was, the Association of Interplanetary
Nations, (NICHT. In the official language of the habitants of Krysa) agreed to
create a platform that would decrease the time between one space trip and
another and they placed in Dhara. Planet Marama has several moons and Dhara is
one of them, it has almost the same size of Marama and they are really close to
The Sun of this planetary system. Although Dhara it´s close to the Sun it does
not receive much radiation from it, thanks to the gravity of Marama it keeps it
in a stable orbit which makes it the perfect place to position the new platform
because of the environment and atmosphere conditions. With the realization of
this universal bridge the frequency of the space travels will increase and will
benefit the Krysa organization. Posterior to the creation of this platform, it
is named officially after the particular place is located in, near a blind spot
to the Sun of that system: Blind Edge.</p>

The content of the game will depend on this point, we have amazing ideas but this means more working time/cost.





Blind Edge in both platforms with all classes (Juggernaut, Striker and Engineer) with ten skills per class  also one weapon (Sword) In two languages English and Spanish.








We have a great story to tell but this means to develop the cinematics scenes and level sequences with this goal we can grow up the team of Babel Games to reach this new Story Mode including Boss Fights


New weapon: The Crossbow. Because the sword have good synergy with the juggernaut and Striker we will develop the Crossbow. Long range weapon able to push, lift or break your enemies with new abilities for each class also we add new looks for weapons and armors.



Create and personalize your character we will also work in the Orb this new weapon bring a different gameplay because it will be the most difficult to control with their respective skills for each class






Like lots

patrimony of Krysa.  Krysa, is the
organization that has the political and military domain over 7 planets, being the
largest and bigger state in 972 nations, among 6 planetary systems. After the
recognition of the big improvement this was, the Association of Interplanetary
Nations, (NICHT. In the official language of the habitants of Krysa) agreed to
create a platform that would decrease the time between one space trip and
another and they placed in Dhara. Planet Marama has several moons and Dhara is
one of them, it has almost the same size of Marama and they are really close to
The Sun of this planetary system. Although Dhara it´s close to the Sun it does
not receive much radiation from it, thanks to the gravity of Marama it keeps it
in a stable orbit which makes it the perfect place to position the new platform
because of the environment and atmosphere conditions. With the realization of
this universal bridge the frequency of the space travels will increase and will
benefit the Krysa organization. Posterior to the creation of this platform, it
is named officially after the particular place is located in, near a blind spot
to the Sun of that system: Blind Edge.
















Blind Edge Original Sountrack (WIP)








Babel Games is a small group of developers with a lot of potential, after a long journey of the first idea we are in this crucial step to reach this transcendental dream. Approximately about 2 years from the initial thought of the game with a lot of motivation and commitment we assume the risk to develop Blind Edge, process cost the investment of a lot of time, days and nights and economic resources to show this humble display of our idea, through Indiegogo and your support we can dedicate all of our time to complete this project to bring your this amazing videogame we also ask for your
support and your opinion on this project. We want to make the process of creating Blind
Edge as open as possible.

Why This Campaign?

Develop with passion
and dedication expressing in this humble campaign which cost a lot of time and
money which we no longer possess we took the risk idea to make a flexible
campaign on Indiegogo.
We decide begin this campaign on august 20 commemorating 38 years of the Voyager II launch, space probe which was sent on a mission to study the planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune addition to the investigations to be performed carries a message that would last 1 billion years. According to this historic event we decided deeply inspired to launch our campaign  that goes beyond entertainment game we want to created is a carrier of a message.
Why Flexible Campaign?

We are an unknown team developers, knowing this, is really difficult get the attention of many users, regardless of this, some passionate gamers decide give their trust to reach this dream, trust which impulse to dedicate all of our effort to complete this project. What happen if we don’t reach our goal? trying to be as transparent as possible to demonstrate all our commitment to realize this dream we will use the funds collected to dedicate full time job to develop Blind Edge to then we be able to make a new campaign with new features, gameplays demo, develop process and more. Our way of showing gratitude is reach the dream those helped us, do not participate in the next campaign and will receive special content to the people who trusted us initially.

Risk

We are a small group of developers which don't have the advanced equipment and workers to progress to speed we would like also we don't add the advertising cost to spread the creation of this project.
How can Help Us?

If you like and want this game to become reality, tell your friends, tell your family and tell the world! Help us to make this game, our dream, come to life. We are grateful for every support because without you, we wouldn’t even be here today.",40.0,0,"1 Campaign

When considering the parallels between what
happens of a chess board and what happens in a board room, there are many
elements that these two environments share.

this campaign.</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>

I have been in the yoyo industry for over 20yrs
and have been an international judge for over 10 years, traveling around the
world to various international competitions.</div><div>
<p>I have seen the evolution of the new generation of playing
styles and the requirement of a high performance BiMetal yoyo. Unfortunately performance comes with a price. Many of them are well beyond the means of many players with the top models going for hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>I started this campaign because I’m seeing a missing
gap in the market. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I wanted to create a BiMetal yoyo that is not only competition worthy but also affordable to everyone. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
</span></p>
<p>I decided to team up with YoyoRanger, a brand who shares the same vision as me. As an upcoming brand relatively new in the
market, I feel that it is the perfect collaboration to fulfill this dream together.</p>
<p>I chose to use crowdfunding to keep the price as low as possible for this first batch before we hit the retail stores where the price will go up. With crowdfunding, there is no middle man in the picture so the price you pay is as low as it gets!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Hertz Story</h3> <p>To achieve this goal of bringing a high performance BiMetal yoyo into the hands of every player, we need help with funding.</p>
<p>I need to raise <b>USD1500</b> which will go directly into the production costs for tooling and machining of the first batch of Hertz.</p>
<p>2 colours are available for purchase, <b>Silver</b> and <b>Black</b>. Early Backers will be able to get them at an affordable price of only <b>USD55</b> each. </p>

<p>There will also be <b>10 Limited Edition Gold</b> coloured Hertz, each individually serialised with a different logo.<br/></p>

</div><div> <p> </p>
<p>While designing this yoyo, I drew ideas from early
prototypes and with feedback from top players in the region. I wanted it to be
a player’s yoyo, designed by players for players.</p>
<p>There were several factors that needed addressing. The size,
the weight, the material and the shape. Everything had to be perfectly in sync
and up to date with market trends and requirements. </p>
<p>It also has to be able to perform new generation tricks like
fingerspins and rejections with ease.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>The final version of what I call the perfect
players' yoyo, the Hertz. It has a diameter of 56.9mm and a width of
43.4mm which is an ideal size and the perfect weight of 66g. </p>
<p>I used 6061 aluminium with a stainless steel rim for the
perfect weight distribution for both horizontal and vertical styles. There were more expensive alternatives like 7075 aluminium but i felt the increased cost didn't justify any significant increase in performance. </p>

<br/> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>So help us spread the word and get this campaign funded and you too can be the next owner of an incredibly affordable yet high performing BiMetal yoyo in the market today.</p>
</div></div>","Hi, my name is Roy Teo and thank you for your interest in
this campaign.



I have been in the yoyo industry for over 20yrs
and have been an international judge for over 10 years, traveling around the
world to various international competitions.
I have seen the evolution of the new generation of playing
styles and the requirement of a high performance BiMetal yoyo. Unfortunately performance comes with a price. Many of them are well beyond the means of many players with the top models going for hundreds of dollars.
I started this campaign because I’m seeing a missing
gap in the market. I wanted to create a BiMetal yoyo that is not only competition worthy but also affordable to everyone. 


I decided to team up with YoyoRanger, a brand who shares the same vision as me. As an upcoming brand relatively new in the
market, I feel that it is the perfect collaboration to fulfill this dream together.
I chose to use crowdfunding to keep the price as low as possible for this first batch before we hit the retail stores where the price will go up. With crowdfunding, there is no middle man in the picture so the price you pay is as low as it gets!


The Hertz Story To achieve this goal of bringing a high performance BiMetal yoyo into the hands of every player, we need help with funding.
I need to raise USD1500 which will go directly into the production costs for tooling and machining of the first batch of Hertz.
2 colours are available for purchase, Silver and Black. Early Backers will be able to get them at an affordable price of only USD55 each. 







There will also be 10 Limited Edition Gold coloured Hertz, each individually serialised with a different logo.

Shipping is FREE worldwide for every order.

The Hertz Design
  
While designing this yoyo, I drew ideas from early
prototypes and with feedback from top players in the region. I wanted it to be
a player’s yoyo, designed by players for players.
There were several factors that needed addressing. The size,
the weight, the material and the shape. Everything had to be perfectly in sync
and up to date with market trends and requirements. 
It also has to be able to perform new generation tricks like
fingerspins and rejections with ease.



The final version of what I call the perfect
players' yoyo, the Hertz. It has a diameter of 56.9mm and a width of
43.4mm which is an ideal size and the perfect weight of 66g. 
I used 6061 aluminium with a stainless steel rim for the
perfect weight distribution for both horizontal and vertical styles. There were more expensive alternatives like 7075 aluminium but i felt the increased cost didn't justify any significant increase in performance.

If you're in the Lynnwood, WA area and you're hearing alternating ""squee!"" and ""OMG!"", that's us. NEXUS: The Zoraidian Oracle is <i>finally</i> out. At least, it is on Windows, and the other platforms will follow as we get them done.<br/></p><p>You can download it <a href=""http://download.aethericworlds.com/nexus/Nexus-installer.exe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">for free, and play the tutorial + 6 games.</a> We decided to go completely ad-free, and return to the old-fashioned notion of trial-ware. </p><p>The backers have received their game codes now - if you're a backer and you have NOT received a game code as of Wednesday, May 20th, PLEASE CONTACT ME! Also, check your spam mail. :/</p><p>In other news, we'll be going to <a href=""http://crypticonseattle.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Crypticon - Seattle</a> on May 22nd - May 24th, where we'll be holding our official Launch Weekend. Please come see us there. <br/></p><p>This will be our last update here, and I'd like to thank everyone who helped us out here. Seriously, thanks - you rock.<br/></p><h3>After the Campaign Update:<br/>
</h3>
<p>Hi. This is Melissa, the president of Ætheric Worlds, coming in with a Really Late After Campaign Update. <br/></p><p>First off, I'm incredibly sorry that this update is so late. We'd intended to get it in at the end of December, but, hey. Holidays. And then in January we moved offices. And you know what? Somewhere in there, we got out an Alpha Build of NEXUS! We're proud of ourselves for that, but it doesn't excuse the lack of update here. <br/></p><h4><i>So what happens now?</i></h4><p>Well, obviously, if we got out an Alpha Build, we're still in production. We are, in fact, still producing NEXUS, to the best of our ability. We moved into a smaller office (better suited to us, actually); we've managed to acquire a few newer (not new, but not ancient) computers, and thanks to our backers from this campaign, we've renewed our necessary software licenses (project management, especially) and business licenses for the next year. </p><p>Having survived until tax season, we're now figuring out what we can and cannot do in terms of art, and where it leaves us in our release schedule. We are, however, still in development. See the updates we release on our Website, or the Facebook, Twitter, and G+ accounts for more information (this campaign probably won't be updated again).</p><p>Thanks for watching here, and we hope to see you out in the world!</p><p>-- <i>Melissa Kell, President, Ætheric Worlds LLC</i><br/></p><h3>Who is Ætheric Worlds and What is Nexus: The Zoraidian Oracle?</h3>
<p>Ætheric Worlds is a fledgling gaming company in Lynnwood, Washington, about 25 miles northeast of Seattle. We currently have over a dozen team members from a diverse set of backgrounds, including programmers, artists, business people, writers, and customer support specialists. We're constantly looking for more compatible people to bring on board as we grow into our dreams. We've all been around the block enough times to know that there's a lot of groundwork and details involved in running a business, and that's what Ætheric is. Well, partly. </p>
<p>The other part is - every single person on the Ætheric Worlds team is a gamer. We love games, and have been playing and designing them for years. Pen and paper role-playing games, card games, multi-user online games, console games, PC games, all of it. As long-time gamers, we know what we <i>expect</i> from gaming companies, and that's what drives us here at Ætheric - giving our customers not only what they want, but what they <i>expect</i>. A solid, quality, entertaining product and a player experience that leaves you wanting more.</p>
<p>Our president is Melissa Kell, who's been involved in several online role-playing projects over the years, most notably <i>Tales of Ta'veren,</i> based on Robert Jordan's <u>Wheel of Time</u> series, from 1995 to 2001. She's also familiar with small business administration, and has accumulated over 15 years of experience in business. </p>
<p>Michelle Travis is our director of writing and the lead designer on the <strong>Nexus</strong> project. She's also the videographer who put together our advertising video! In addition, she's an accomplished amateur fiction writer, a professional technical writer, and has 25 years of experience in designing and playing games. </p>
<p>Directing our Engineering group is JT Traub, who has over 20 years of experience in the software industry, including working on game engine development and AI development. One of his more recent game projects was as a co-developer of <i>Legend of the Green Dragon</i>.</p>
<p><strong>Nexus</strong> is the first of the games Ætheric Worlds is planning. Based in the world of Tyanaphos, <strong>Nexus: The Zoraidian Oracle</strong> provides a glimpse into the larger world that is waiting to be brought forward, while also providing an engaging game of itself. A strategic solitaire card game inspired by Hanafuda (a traditional Japanese flower card game similar to mahjong or rummy), <strong>Nexus</strong> can be either relaxing or challenging to your critical thinking skills, all based on how you approach it. As with any solitaire game, you can choose to go after the highest points available in any hand... but there are other options as well, and sometimes points aren't the final goal. In the end, it's all about the choices you make. </p>
<p>This campaign, too, is all about the choices <i>you</i> make. Ætheric Worlds is a small studio, and we're just getting started. <b>Nexus</b> is only the first of many games that we have planned – games that we want to share with you, games that we want to play with you. You're the key part to this; without you, this doesn't happen. This campaign allows us to bring <strong>Nexus</strong> to you, and also allows us to keep moving forward afterward, so we can bring the next game to you. And the next, and then the next. And if we reach our goal here... well, you get a little more than just the rewards listed to the right there. After all, you're not <i>just</i> helping out one game here, you're helping out the whole studio, and we want you to know we appreciate it. So as we go on, we'll let you know what we can do to show that.</p>
<p>Starting with <strong>Nexus</strong>. Because that's just the beginning. After all, we have to start somewhere.</p>

<p><i>All art on this page is concept art related to the world of Tyanaphos, which Nexus is based on. We'd love to show you the Nexus cards themselves, but that's part of what we're trying to get - the finished artwork.</i></p>
<h3>So why that much?</h3>
<p>Yeah, $50,000 is a lot of money. In her own words, Michelle Travis explains what it's all for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, my name's Michelle Travis. I'm the Director of Writing for Ætheric Worlds, and the lead designer on the <strong>Nexus</strong> project. I'd like to take a couple minutes to tell you about <strong>Nexus</strong> and how you can help bring it, and some of Ætheric's other projects, to fruition.</p>
<p>Over the next thirty or so days, we're aiming for a crowdfunding goal of $50,000. What's this for? Well, I'll tell you.</p>
<p>First, part of it goes to pay IndieGoGo and other administrative fees just for running this in the first place. And that also includes making sure that those of you who support this campaign of ours get your stuff. It's only fair.</p>
<p>Next, part of it goes toward the operational costs, software, and hardware for running Ætheric Worlds - this is stuff like rent, computers, accounting and office software, that sort of thing. Right now we're really doing this on a shoestring, and while that's a sort of good thing for costs, it kind of puts a damper on productivity. And we have a LOT of plans here at Ætheric Worlds. </p>
<p>But the biggest part is for <strong>Nexus</strong> itself. Specifically, the art.</p>
<p>There are 144 cards in the <strong>Nexus</strong> deck - all of which will have distinctly unique art. Even though Ætheric has concept artists on staff, with 144 separate cards, that's a lot of art. So, to get the art done more quickly, as well as with enough diversity to make it visually interesting, we're commissioning multiple artists to translate our ideas from concept to completion.</p>
<p>And even though we here at Ætheric all are currently working for free, we can't expect the artists we intend to commission to do so. </p>
<p>As a quick aside, if you are an artist and are interested in taking on one or more of the commissions for the <strong>Nexus</strong> project, please see <a href=""http://aethericworlds.com/nexus.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the <strong>Nexus</strong> project page</a> for more information on what we're looking for and how to contact us.</p>
<p>This also includes the sound assets for <strong>Nexus</strong>, such as sound effects and music. Incidentally, <strong>Nexus</strong> will be featuring entirely original music. Which is quite cool.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the fundamental design of <strong>Nexus</strong>, how it works, the rules, and that stuff is already done. And we've playtested this like mad (it's kinda brought out the competitive side of the folks in the office.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> --------------------- </p>
<blockquote><p><i>If you would like a further breakdown of what specifically we're spending the money on, please see the attached update. Please contact Melissa if you'd like to discus direct investing. </i></p></blockquote>
<h4> A few additional details</h4>
<p><strong>What platforms will this game work on?</strong> We're using the Unity 3d engine, which is allowing us a lot of flexibility. As a result, we'll be able to release the game onto Windows (7, 8, and probably Modern), Mac, iOS, Android, and Ubuntu Linux. At this time, we don't expect to make it available for other flavors of Linux (it depends on the... well, dependencies), but we'll see.</p>
<p><strong>How are you handling overseas fulfillment?</strong> Since there's not a lot of shipping involved, even at the higher level, we simply factored in the probable price of overseas shipping. If you're an overseas client who would like one of the higher level perks, just go ahead and sign up for it. Once we're ready to fulfill the physical items, we'll contact you and work out how best to get your items to you, so that they arrive in the best condition. In all cases - national and international fulfillment - we're likely to try and minimize the number of shipments we have going out, simply to reduce the number of things that can possibly get lost.</p>
<h4>But... what if Ætheric doesn't make the campaign goal? What happens to Nexus and Ætheric Worlds, and where does the money go?</h4>
<p>Well, that depends on how <i>far</i> short we fall, actually.</p>
<p>We know that art is the most urgent need we have right now. For that, we need about $9,000 (including IndieGoGo's fees and the stuff for you guys). That will allow us to get the art started, although we probably won't be able to get all of it immediately, and we'll definitely have to figure out how to pay for a fair amount from our tax returns and credit cards. We'll also close our office space down to just a mailbox and a phone number, and we'll have to push the completion of <strong>Nexus</strong> out a few months. We'll also probably lose the contract to digitize another game that we're currently in the running for, since we wouldn't be able to get to it for nearly a year.</p>
<p>As soon as we reach about $18-20,000, the art is paid for and at that point, everything else is assigned to the areas of greatest need. For every thousand after that, we either set aside money for rent, purchase another computer, or acquire &amp; update our software licenses, depending on which part is furthest behind. </p>
<p>There is no point at which <strong>Nexus</strong> will not be under development, no matter how little this campaign brings in. The only question is <i>how slow</i> or <i>how fast</i> that development is, and that is entirely up to you.</p>

<h3>So why is Ætheric any different than other gaming companies?</h3>
<p>At Ætheric, we believe that the gaming industry frequently isn't fair to the people who make games – in hours, wages, and turnover – and as long as that's true, it's difficult to form a community. We've seen that often, as soon as players start to bond with a developer, that developer is suddenly gone from the company, and the players become a little more jaded with the next developer to come along or in the next community they join. It doesn't have to be that way. We also all happen to be optimistic enough to believe that people are more than just replaceable resources inside the business machine, and that if we treat employees like <i>people</i>, and as if they are important to the success of the company (which they are!), then we will in turn get the type of people who value that treatment, and respond by giving their absolute best in return. </p>
<p>We want to support our employees, both on and off the job, with cross-training, professional development, and benefits that provide options to fit the employee's life. We want to encourage our employees to become a community within the company – and then to reach out to our customers, to help form a community with them. We have the shared interests already, so let's expand on that, and make it a place where we can find others to have fun with. We want you to play our games with your friends, your family, your spouse, your kids and your grand-kids. And we want you to play our games with us, too. </p>
<p>Starting with <strong>Nexus</strong>. We know where we're going; we have it all planned out. We've got so much more to give you. Thank you for helping us get there, and for coming along on our journey.</p>
<h3>What if contributing isn't in the cards?</h3>
<p>That's okay! You can still help. </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell people about this campaign! That's the only way to get it out there. </li>
<li>Drop us a note and tell us that you're interested! You can do it off our website, and we'd like to know.</li>
<li>Don't forget to use the Indiegogo 'share tools' – that helps get the word out, too. </li>

<blockquote><p><i>There are lessons to be learned in every moment of your life.
<br/>       --Zoraidia the Sage</i></p></blockquote>
<h3>The Story of the Zoraidian Oracle</h3>
<p>To most people on the world of Tyanaphos, Zoraidia is
nothing more than a mysterious figure in history; a reclusive Prophetess who guided her brother, the great leader and teacher Sang Aparo. To those who know both magic and history, however, Zoraidia is a figure that looms as large as her legendary brother, for it was through her hands that the Oracle Deck first came into being. </p>
<p>Half-Human, half-Forestborn, Zoraidia learned about the Tarot from her human relatives. In her hands, the deck helped her focus her
untrained abilities, but because of its purely human history, she found it alien to her world and her understanding. Guided by instinct, she created a new, larger deck that encompassed all of the races within her world – the tall Forestborn, the amphibious Wavecalled, the nocturnal Stoneforged, and the diverse Starmade from so many other worlds and times. Over the course of years, images of these races were all gathered and divided into seven Lesser Arcana, each embracing an overarching concept. She also formed a Greater Arcana based on the Archetypes and Artifacts from legends and the conflicting Dualities that govern fundamental nature of all living things. When she was done with this great Master-work that consumed so many years of her life, Zoraidia fell prey to her gift, and began to prophesize the major nexus points for Tyanaphos for decades and centuries to come. </p>
<p>Scholars came to study Zoraidia's deck, and thus, slowly,
copies were made and distributed. In the hands of the truly gifted, nexus points for the populous can be foreseen. Those with minor gifts may be able to see for others, while most can only discern the barest glimmer of their own path. However, for most people, regardless of race or ability, the Zoraidian Oracle remains only a game.</p>

<h3>Explain more about the perks?</h3>
<p>Well, for one thing, all of the titles that you get for the
first four levels will be granted to you for use on your Ætheric account, for use in our games where titles can be shown (future games, and if we can figure out how to manage it, in our forums). Plus, you get your name on <a href=""http://aethericworlds.com/benefactors.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a permanent Thank You page</a> attached to the <strong>Nexus</strong> webpage, and we'll give you a shout-out on Facebook, Twitter or G+, too. One title and all that recognition just for a single dollar! Of course, if you give more than that, you get the game (once we have it ready for release) - and then we start tossing in artwork. </p>
<p>Now, as you might have guessed by the quality of our video, we're serious about the quality of our artwork. When we start offering an
exclusive digital wallpaper, we're not talking about the card back blown up to 1280x800. We're talking about something nice, done by an artist with reasonably good name recognition (Michelle has a whole list of artists she wants to commission for this, we have to keep telling her she only gets one). But our featured perk is even better: you not only get the wallpaper, you also get, included, the additional background, card back, <i>and</i> <strong>original</strong> music options that won't be available for anyone else but our sponsors at game release (everyone else will have to purchase them separately when they're released later).</p>
<p>What if you want something even <i>more</i> original and collectable? Well, we have you covered – you (or someone you love) can be <strong>in the game</strong>. We have a limited number of places where people are able to be featured as characters on the cards. If you choose one of these perks, please feel free to contact us immediately to find out which cards are available.</p></div>","IT'S OUT!Hi, this is Melissa. If you're in the Lynnwood, WA area and you're hearing alternating ""squee!"" and ""OMG!"", that's us. NEXUS: The Zoraidian Oracle is finally out. At least, it is on Windows, and the other platforms will follow as we get them done.You can download it for free, and play the tutorial + 6 games. We decided to go completely ad-free, and return to the old-fashioned notion of trial-ware. The backers have received their game codes now - if you're a backer and you have NOT received a game code as of Wednesday, May 20th, PLEASE CONTACT ME! Also, check your spam mail. :/In other news, we'll be going to Crypticon - Seattle on May 22nd - May 24th, where we'll be holding our official Launch Weekend. Please come see us there. This will be our last update here, and I'd like to thank everyone who helped us out here. Seriously, thanks - you rock.After the Campaign Update:

Hi. This is Melissa, the president of Ætheric Worlds, coming in with a Really Late After Campaign Update. First off, I'm incredibly sorry that this update is so late. We'd intended to get it in at the end of December, but, hey. Holidays. And then in January we moved offices. And you know what? Somewhere in there, we got out an Alpha Build of NEXUS! We're proud of ourselves for that, but it doesn't excuse the lack of update here. So what happens now?Well, obviously, if we got out an Alpha Build, we're still in production. We are, in fact, still producing NEXUS, to the best of our ability. We moved into a smaller office (better suited to us, actually); we've managed to acquire a few newer (not new, but not ancient) computers, and thanks to our backers from this campaign, we've renewed our necessary software licenses (project management, especially) and business licenses for the next year. Having survived until tax season, we're now figuring out what we can and cannot do in terms of art, and where it leaves us in our release schedule. We are, however, still in development. See the updates we release on our Website, or the Facebook, Twitter, and G+ accounts for more information (this campaign probably won't be updated again).Thanks for watching here, and we hope to see you out in the world!-- Melissa Kell, President, Ætheric Worlds LLCWho is Ætheric Worlds and What is Nexus: The Zoraidian Oracle?
Ætheric Worlds is a fledgling gaming company in Lynnwood, Washington, about 25 miles northeast of Seattle. We currently have over a dozen team members from a diverse set of backgrounds, including programmers, artists, business people, writers, and customer support specialists. We're constantly looking for more compatible people to bring on board as we grow into our dreams. We've all been around the block enough times to know that there's a lot of groundwork and details involved in running a business, and that's what Ætheric is. Well, partly. 
The other part is - every single person on the Ætheric Worlds team is a gamer. We love games, and have been playing and designing them for years. Pen and paper role-playing games, card games, multi-user online games, console games, PC games, all of it. As long-time gamers, we know what we expect from gaming companies, and that's what drives us here at Ætheric - giving our customers not only what they want, but what they expect. A solid, quality, entertaining product and a player experience that leaves you wanting more.
Our president is Melissa Kell, who's been involved in several online role-playing projects over the years, most notably Tales of Ta'veren, based on Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, from 1995 to 2001. She's also familiar with small business administration, and has accumulated over 15 years of experience in business. 
Michelle Travis is our director of writing and the lead designer on the Nexus project. She's also the videographer who put together our advertising video! In addition, she's an accomplished amateur fiction writer, a professional technical writer, and has 25 years of experience in designing and playing games. 
Directing our Engineering group is JT Traub, who has over 20 years of experience in the software industry, including working on game engine development and AI development. One of his more recent game projects was as a co-developer of Legend of the Green Dragon.
Nexus is the first of the games Ætheric Worlds is planning. Based in the world of Tyanaphos, Nexus: The Zoraidian Oracle provides a glimpse into the larger world that is waiting to be brought forward, while also providing an engaging game of itself. A strategic solitaire card game inspired by Hanafuda (a traditional Japanese flower card game similar to mahjong or rummy), Nexus can be either relaxing or challenging to your critical thinking skills, all based on how you approach it. As with any solitaire game, you can choose to go after the highest points available in any hand... but there are other options as well, and sometimes points aren't the final goal. In the end, it's all about the choices you make. 
This campaign, too, is all about the choices you make. Ætheric Worlds is a small studio, and we're just getting started. Nexus is only the first of many games that we have planned – games that we want to share with you, games that we want to play with you. You're the key part to this; without you, this doesn't happen. This campaign allows us to bring Nexus to you, and also allows us to keep moving forward afterward, so we can bring the next game to you. And the next, and then the next. And if we reach our goal here... well, you get a little more than just the rewards listed to the right there. After all, you're not just helping out one game here, you're helping out the whole studio, and we want you to know we appreciate it. So as we go on, we'll let you know what we can do to show that.
Starting with Nexus. Because that's just the beginning. After all, we have to start somewhere.

All art on this page is concept art related to the world of Tyanaphos, which Nexus is based on. We'd love to show you the Nexus cards themselves, but that's part of what we're trying to get - the finished artwork.
So why that much?
Yeah, $50,000 is a lot of money. In her own words, Michelle Travis explains what it's all for:

Hello, my name's Michelle Travis. I'm the Director of Writing for Ætheric Worlds, and the lead designer on the Nexus project. I'd like to take a couple minutes to tell you about Nexus and how you can help bring it, and some of Ætheric's other projects, to fruition.
Over the next thirty or so days, we're aiming for a crowdfunding goal of $50,000. What's this for? Well, I'll tell you.
First, part of it goes to pay IndieGoGo and other administrative fees just for running this in the first place. And that also includes making sure that those of you who support this campaign of ours get your stuff. It's only fair.
Next, part of it goes toward the operational costs, software, and hardware for running Ætheric Worlds - this is stuff like rent, computers, accounting and office software, that sort of thing. Right now we're really doing this on a shoestring, and while that's a sort of good thing for costs, it kind of puts a damper on productivity. And we have a LOT of plans here at Ætheric Worlds. 
But the biggest part is for Nexus itself. Specifically, the art.
There are 144 cards in the Nexus deck - all of which will have distinctly unique art. Even though Ætheric has concept artists on staff, with 144 separate cards, that's a lot of art. So, to get the art done more quickly, as well as with enough diversity to make it visually interesting, we're commissioning multiple artists to translate our ideas from concept to completion.
And even though we here at Ætheric all are currently working for free, we can't expect the artists we intend to commission to do so. 
As a quick aside, if you are an artist and are interested in taking on one or more of the commissions for the Nexus project, please see the Nexus project page for more information on what we're looking for and how to contact us.
This also includes the sound assets for Nexus, such as sound effects and music. Incidentally, Nexus will be featuring entirely original music. Which is quite cool.
On the bright side, the fundamental design of Nexus, how it works, the rules, and that stuff is already done. And we've playtested this like mad (it's kinda brought out the competitive side of the folks in the office.) 

 --------------------- 
If you would like a further breakdown of what specifically we're spending the money on, please see the attached update. Please contact Melissa if you'd like to discus direct investing. 
 A few additional details
What platforms will this game work on? We're using the Unity 3d engine, which is allowing us a lot of flexibility. As a result, we'll be able to release the game onto Windows (7, 8, and probably Modern), Mac, iOS, Android, and Ubuntu Linux. At this time, we don't expect to make it available for other flavors of Linux (it depends on the... well, dependencies), but we'll see.
How are you handling overseas fulfillment? Since there's not a lot of shipping involved, even at the higher level, we simply factored in the probable price of overseas shipping. If you're an overseas client who would like one of the higher level perks, just go ahead and sign up for it. Once we're ready to fulfill the physical items, we'll contact you and work out how best to get your items to you, so that they arrive in the best condition. In all cases - national and international fulfillment - we're likely to try and minimize the number of shipments we have going out, simply to reduce the number of things that can possibly get lost.
But... what if Ætheric doesn't make the campaign goal? What happens to Nexus and Ætheric Worlds, and where does the money go?
Well, that depends on how far short we fall, actually.
We know that art is the most urgent need we have right now. For that, we need about $9,000 (including IndieGoGo's fees and the stuff for you guys). That will allow us to get the art started, although we probably won't be able to get all of it immediately, and we'll definitely have to figure out how to pay for a fair amount from our tax returns and credit cards. We'll also close our office space down to just a mailbox and a phone number, and we'll have to push the completion of Nexus out a few months. We'll also probably lose the contract to digitize another game that we're currently in the running for, since we wouldn't be able to get to it for nearly a year.
As soon as we reach about $18-20,000, the art is paid for and at that point, everything else is assigned to the areas of greatest need. For every thousand after that, we either set aside money for rent, purchase another computer, or acquire & update our software licenses, depending on which part is furthest behind. 
There is no point at which Nexus will not be under development, no matter how little this campaign brings in. The only question is how slow or how fast that development is, and that is entirely up to you.

So why is Ætheric any different than other gaming companies?
At Ætheric, we believe that the gaming industry frequently isn't fair to the people who make games – in hours, wages, and turnover – and as long as that's true, it's difficult to form a community. We've seen that often, as soon as players start to bond with a developer, that developer is suddenly gone from the company, and the players become a little more jaded with the next developer to come along or in the next community they join. It doesn't have to be that way. We also all happen to be optimistic enough to believe that people are more than just replaceable resources inside the business machine, and that if we treat employees like people, and as if they are important to the success of the company (which they are!), then we will in turn get the type of people who value that treatment, and respond by giving their absolute best in return. 
We want to support our employees, both on and off the job, with cross-training, professional development, and benefits that provide options to fit the employee's life. We want to encourage our employees to become a community within the company – and then to reach out to our customers, to help form a community with them. We have the shared interests already, so let's expand on that, and make it a place where we can find others to have fun with. We want you to play our games with your friends, your family, your spouse, your kids and your grand-kids. And we want you to play our games with us, too. 
Starting with Nexus. We know where we're going; we have it all planned out. We've got so much more to give you. Thank you for helping us get there, and for coming along on our journey.

       --Zoraidia the Sage
The Story of the Zoraidian Oracle
To most people on the world of Tyanaphos, Zoraidia is
nothing more than a mysterious figure in history; a reclusive Prophetess who guided her brother, the great leader and teacher Sang Aparo. To those who know both magic and history, however, Zoraidia is a figure that looms as large as her legendary brother, for it was through her hands that the Oracle Deck first came into being. 
Half-Human, half-Forestborn, Zoraidia learned about the Tarot from her human relatives. In her hands, the deck helped her focus her
untrained abilities, but because of its purely human history, she found it alien to her world and her understanding. Guided by instinct, she created a new, larger deck that encompassed all of the races within her world – the tall Forestborn, the amphibious Wavecalled, the nocturnal Stoneforged, and the diverse Starmade from so many other worlds and times. Over the course of years, images of these races were all gathered and divided into seven Lesser Arcana, each embracing an overarching concept. She also formed a Greater Arcana based on the Archetypes and Artifacts from legends and the conflicting Dualities that govern fundamental nature of all living things. When she was done with this great Master-work that consumed so many years of her life, Zoraidia fell prey to her gift, and began to prophesize the major nexus points for Tyanaphos for decades and centuries to come. 
Scholars came to study Zoraidia's deck, and thus, slowly,
copies were made and distributed. In the hands of the truly gifted, nexus points for the populous can be foreseen. Those with minor gifts may be able to see for others, while most can only discern the barest glimmer of their own path. However, for most people, regardless of race or ability, the Zoraidian Oracle remains only a game.

 once again create the wildest, strangest, craziest, and most unique 
adventure available for Free RPG Day. The setup is that 100 women in 
town claim one of their sons is missing. But nobody else, not their 
husbands, not their other kids, remembers these particular children ever
 existing. The women all say their children were all born on the same 
day, in the same year, the descriptions given of the children are all 
identical, and are even all named Andrew (""It's just a coincidence, 
stranger things have happened!"" they say if pressed about how odd this 
is). The key to solving this mystery lies in the hills near town, where 
strange telepathic menace, alien technology, and one strange wizard will
 be discovered. </p><p>Writing by James Edward Raggi IV, Cover and 
interior art by Gennifer Bone, cartography by Devin Night (he did the 
God that Crawls module cartography).</p>When you back the adventure, you will get the full and complete adventure, complete with a numbered alternate cover (which is quite unlikely to be as racy as last year's). Last year we assumed that most people could get to their local stores to pick up a copy and thus offered only alternate covers as part of the campaign... that was a bit of a fiasco. When you go for this one, it's the full adventure this year. Due to Free RPG Day rules, we can't ship out backer copies of the adventure until July 1, and the PDF version can't go up until then either.<p></p><p>This costs 12€, +7€ for each additional copy (including alternate covers) that you want.<br/></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><b>Flame Princess T-Shirt</b></b></p><p>This new shirt is available in short sleeve and long sleeve, with the main design by Jez Gordon:</p><b></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/338327/files/20140130035507-sample.jpg?1391082907"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>(a mockup, obviously, actual design is final but how it'll look on the real shirt may differ)</p><p>The

 IndieGoGo requires payment up front when you make your pledge and this 
cannot be lowered after the fact (and can only be raised by making a new
 contribution). Be very sure before you hit that payment button.Lamentations of the Flame Princess is a horror/fantasy/adventure tabletop role-playing game produced in Finland. It's as if D█████ & D████, heavy metal played in unsafe basement clubs, and those weird horror 
movies that don't get MPAA ratings in the US and just get shown at 
festivals,  were all murdered, then disemboweled and their guts dumped into a puke bucket and the resulting slime and juices sipped through one of those crazy loopy straws.(OK, it's only like that sometimes, but we like to screen out the people who get all snippy about it.)We've released dozens of things, both in print (and shirts and bookmarks!) and in PDF.Free RPG Day is a scheme to promote tabletop role-playing games and the retail stores that sell them by organizing a day where people can go to those stores and get free stuff from all sorts of publishers, big and small. Hundreds of stores worldwide participate.LotFP needs about $5500 to participate in Free RPG Day at the maximum level -- 10,500 copies to be distributed free through participating game stores on June 21, 2014. That's just for printing and shipping to the Free RPG Day warehouse. There are also other production costs (cartography, artwork, etc.) to deal with.All for a project that's going to be given away both through Free RPG Day and then available as a free PDF (technically Pay What You Want, but most people pay $0) in July. A small publisher just can't eat that cost. Thus, this campaign. Yeah, we've still got some items that are overdue (including some backer perks from 2013's Free RPG Day campaign... we got the funded adventure to stores though), and the monster 
Ref book project that's not late but still being worked on, so we've 
kept this campaign simple to make sure we can deliver these perks in a timely manner without further delaying everything else.So it's up to you. Should I just lay low until everything else is done, or would this be a worthy thing to blast out to the gaming world? VOTE WITH YOUR MONEY.Hitting the base goal will allow for the art to get done and the PDF to be released and the perks all fulfilled. Doing actual print runs for retail and how large will depend on how much money this crowdfunding thing generates and how much the perks cost to fulfill. I estimate about $11000 (8200€, give or take), will pay for manufacturing and shipping all the perks, plus the 10,500 print run and shipping to the printer, while accounting for the IndieGoGo fees. If we don't get all the way there, we'll do a smaller print run. No biggee. Up to you.Here is the free PDF download for our 2013 Free RPG Day release, Better Than Any Man. It's an ""Adult Content"" release, so you'll need to log in over there at RPGNow in order to see it. It generated a bit of controversy at the time (see here for just one example, with added commentary here), but also achieved critical success (examples here and here and here).But that was rather insane to just give away. This year we're going for something a little more modest - a 32 page dungeon crawl with a more punk rock visual approach. But what a dungeon crawl it is!We're doing an à la carte approach to this campaign. NO PERK LEVELS. Just put in the money for the stuff you want. All prices include 2nd class shipping worldwide. Here are the things you can grab:The Doom Cave of the Crystal-Headed Children(art by Gennifer Bone)This is the adventure that will be (hopefully) distributed through hundreds of game stores worldwide. But some of you don't have a participating store nearby, or you want to help out, or you want to get the exclusive content!With The Doom Cave of the Crystal-Headed Children we intend to
 once again create the wildest, strangest, craziest, and most unique 
adventure available for Free RPG Day. The setup is that 100 women in 
town claim one of their sons is missing. But nobody else, not their 
husbands, not their other kids, remembers these particular children ever
 existing. The women all say their children were all born on the same 
day, in the same year, the descriptions given of the children are all 
identical, and are even all named Andrew (""It's just a coincidence, 
stranger things have happened!"" they say if pressed about how odd this 
is). The key to solving this mystery lies in the hills near town, where 
strange telepathic menace, alien technology, and one strange wizard will
 be discovered. Writing by James Edward Raggi IV, Cover and 
interior art by Gennifer Bone, cartography by Devin Night (he did the 
God that Crawls module cartography).When you back the adventure, you will get the full and complete adventure, complete with a numbered alternate cover (which is quite unlikely to be as racy as last year's). Last year we assumed that most people could get to their local stores to pick up a copy and thus offered only alternate covers as part of the campaign... that was a bit of a fiasco. When you go for this one, it's the full adventure this year. Due to Free RPG Day rules, we can't ship out backer copies of the adventure until July 1, and the PDF version can't go up until then either.This costs 12€, +7€ for each additional copy (including alternate covers) that you want.Flame Princess T-ShirtThis new shirt is available in short sleeve and long sleeve, with the main design by Jez Gordon:(a mockup, obviously, actual design is final but how it'll look on the real shirt may differ)The
 lower back will have the LotFP logo, and if you go for long sleeves, 
there will be Dead Sign sleeve prints. All on 5.3oz 100% cotton shirts 
with all graphics screen printed.Sizes available: ""Classic Fit"" S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL, Ladies S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXLThe
 shirts will go to press as soon as the campaign ends and we know what 
size everyone wants. They will ship immediately upon being received.Short sleeve shirts cost 20€ for the first one, +17€ for each additional shirt you want. +7€ each to make a shirt a long sleeve with Dead Signs down each sleeve.These shirts are exclusive to this campaign. (We always order a couple extra in every size to guard against that odd lost package, so they may show up at the table of some convention we go to, but unless you're at the right convention in London or Birmingham or Helsinki or Stockholm at the right time...)If you're in the US, the shirts will be mailed to you by longtime LotFP supporter Matt Johnsen, so know that your info will go through one extra set of hands.LotFP Tote BagsCan't do a fundraiser without tote bags! This is a simple black tote bag with the LotFP logo in white on one side. 12€ for the first one, 10€ for each additional that you want. These tote bags are exclusive to this campaign.(the company I am using has done these tote bags before, I figure mine will look similar.)(Gardening Society members going in for 35€ or more total get a free tote bag. If you've already cleared that hurdle to qualify for a tote bag, additional bags are 10€ each.)Tote bags will go to press and mail at the same time as the shirts.If you're in the US, the tote bags will be mailed to you by longtime LotFP 
supporter Matt Johnsen, so know that your info will go through one extra

the sticky goop that permeates the city conducts electricity and can be 
scattered about with explosions or set ablaze with fire. They interact 
with your weapons as well: sending creeping projectiles through a goop 
puddle leaves behind sticky, incendiary trails, while bouncing 
projectiles through lightning weaves a zapping web. </p>

that’s no problem for a well-coordinated squad that knows how to use the arc

DieselStörmers has already been funded to be brought to Early Access on Steam. Now we want to give everyone who missed the first funding round or wants to pay via paypal the chance to still participate without us needing to set up a direct pledging infrastructure. Yes, Chris Roberts' team does this on the fly, our team is busy with bringing DieselStörmers to Early Access. And who knows, maybe there is the chance for one or the other stretch goal beyond the 2.500 EUR.  DieselStörmers is a furious action game that 
follows the inhabitants of Ravensdale taking back their city from a 
rampaging ork horde. On release, the game will have a story/campaign 
mode that allows you to pick among a range of different missions with 
varying difficulties, objectives and parameters. You can play in 
singleplayer mode or with up to four teammates in coop multiplayer mode
 to enable additional team strategies like energy arcs between players, 
team upgrades, complementing shot patterns and the parallel use of 
environmental objects. Coop at its best. Steam Early Access is the perfect
 program for indie developers to involve dedicated players in the games 
development. The final game will be released on Windows PC, followed by 
Linux and Mac versions (Steam). We are also planning for XboxOne, PS4 
and a good chance for WiiU. DRM free version: Steam provides a great infrastructure for online co-op-games. 
As supporters of DRM-free gaming (see Giana Sisters) we will provide a 
DRM free version as soon as the sales success makes it viable to set up 
this infrastructure ourselves.We are Black Forest Games, an independent Games Developer who already delivered on a crowdfunding campaign with Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams.If you can't contribute, you still can support the project. Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. And don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools.The People behind DieselStörmers

Welcome to Ravensdale, a city where medieval meets machine, a

wrenches in oil-stained overalls, and not a single dragon dares to brave
 the smog-filled sky. 
You can assemble your own weapons out of parts, constructing them from a constantly growing pool of random loot drops, combining different shot patterns with special properties like rebounding, creeping, eruptive, indendiary, goopy and many more.







Enemies have exchangeable weapons, gadgets and even body parts 
 to create different combinations of how they move, attack, and which 
special abilities they use. Example abilites include berserking on a 
trigger condition, transporting environmental objects and propagating 
elemental hazards like goop and fire.








Missions are guerilla warfare-themed and typically involve you 
sabotaging, assassinating or liberating something or someone in 
ork-occupied territory. Optional mission goals can be fulfilled along 
the way for bonus rewards. Those usually involve tougher, but avoidable 
challenges like reaching an objective in time or taking out particularly
 tough or evasive enemies.

<p>Hello dear visitors! My name is Alexander Spielvogel, I am 31 years old and I am coming from Bavaria/Germany. In the past I already created several tools for games like World of Warcraft (<a href=""http://wowl.bl4cksh33p.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WoW Launcher PLUS</a>) or Cube World (<a href=""http://cwlp.bl4cksh33p.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cube World Launcher PLUS</a>). At <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">the end of 2013 I started to create my first HTML 5 games with Construct 2. After getting some experience with it </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I want to create my first extensive game ""Lunar Catch"" which uses the new multiplayer features of Construct. (<a href=""http://lunarcatch.bl4cksh33p.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">More about the game.</a>)</span></p>

</div></div>","Hello dear visitors! My name is Alexander Spielvogel, I am 31 years old and I am coming from Bavaria/Germany. In the past I already created several tools for games like World of Warcraft (WoW Launcher PLUS) or Cube World (Cube World Launcher PLUS). At the end of 2013 I started to create my first HTML 5 games with Construct 2. After getting some experience with it I want to create my first extensive game ""Lunar Catch"" which uses the new multiplayer features of Construct. (More about the game.)
It was always my dream to work as Game-Designer and I was a ""Gamer"" since my early childhood. Computer- and Videogames were always fascinating to me, not only because you can visit unique worlds and experience new stories, but also the design and details like game balance always interested me.
With this campaign I want to release my game on Steam, rent a server for multiplayer matchmaking, buy software and art packs and collect some money for advertising. Additional bonus targets are hiring an artist for character and level art, a musician for more soundtrack and more game features and content.
Since the game is in an early alpha stage more details like playable characters or the soundtrack will be added in the coming days and weeks. Please take a look at the Updates-Tab above.

   




90 € for STEAM Greenlight
100 € for Software and Server
100 € for Artpack and Effects
200 € for Marketing
about 140 € Taxes and Fees

To reach this goal you can select from many different perks (on the right). You can get additional content like wallpapers, the soundtrack or even a new unlockable character.If you want something very special you can get one of the limited perks to create your very own character in the game!

I will try my best to help you design it but my graphical skills are limited. If you can give me some templates it will help to create your new char. If more money can be raised to achieve bonus goals I will try to hire an artist for new characters.


I use the flexible funding model and if my goal is not achieved I will use the funded money to fulfill most of the things listed above and try to use my own money for the rest. The list above is sorted with the highest priorities on top.


If more money can be raised it will be used for bonus targets to further improve the game. 




 This is my first try to use crowdfunding for one of my projects and you can be a part of it. With your help I will be able to bring my game to STEAM, one of the biggest digital publishing platforms in the world. And since my graphical skills are limited I can make the game look much better with new art and effects. But that's not all. Since Lunar Catch has a big focus on multiplayer a dedicated server for matchmaking and hosting the games will make the game connections faster and better, and reduce lag spikes.
With your support, this can be a much better game. And I will try my best to make it as good as possible.

But my skills at drawing are very limited and I need to use free or low-priced assets to create levels and characters.
I am always trying to get better and improve my skills, but your help will significantly improve my progress.
Update: We found some nice templates to create cartoon characters and decided to change all photos (level backgrounds) to cartoons. This should create a consistent look.

<p>Iowa By Trail is the first app of its kind in
the nation allowing
Iowans to explore 1,800 miles of multi-use trails around the state using their
smartphones. <i>But it's more than an app:</i> It’s a platform to showcase and brand Iowa’s
premier trail system, helping Iowans and visitors discover the best parts of our extensive trail network and the communities along it.</p>
<p>The app helps users
find trails closest to them, discover interesting stops along the way—restaurants,
state parks, restrooms—and keeps users updated on trail closures and events. The tool, available to iOS users since May, is great for both experienced explorers and first-timers using the trails for wellness and fun. And the best part? <b>It's free.</b></p>

Panda's Ark is creative, modern take on a donations platform in a gaming environment! Plus it's going to be distributed Free on iOS and Android!
**Note** The Project is moving forward with or without reaching the flex goal. There is no worry or your donation being meaningless or lost and your donation will only help us enhance the projects timeline and features.Our goal it to create a game that is simple, addictive, entertaining for all ages, and has a positive message of protecting wildlife! What a better way to help the animals than by playing a game and donating!Here are some of the Features:
10 Animals to choose from full of cuteness and power
10 beautiful levels of craziness to go through
Collect Power-ups to use such as point multipliers and time slowers
Donate to your favorite charities for the animals!
3 Episodes to be released for continued free content!
Speaking of donating, let's get right to that! Players will have the option of donating in game currency to the animal of their choice. There are key factors here:
Players must have the animal unlocked so if you want to donate to the famous Panda, unlock them ALL.
Players begin with 20% of a donation. For every 100 Buddy Power Donated, $0.20 is donated to the charity of choice. 
For each level you beat with an animal, their donation level goes up! Beat level 10 with an animal and the donation is as high as 30%!!!
There is no better feeling than donating while playing a game!Players will take a journey in Episode One, one animal at a time, on the path to Panda's Ark, where they will be saved! You will begin with 3 animals unlocked and ready for adventuring! After choosing one of the animals, your story begins and you will be taken to the game screen where you will find and collect point, items, and animals by popping bubbles in order to move forward. Bubbles get faster, slower, have different color combinations, At later levels they even change shape! Sounds easy, but wait until you play. It's not as easy as you think to keep track!You will be competing on leader boards, against friends, for stars, and progress.
