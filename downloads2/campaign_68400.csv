<p>Companies seeking investment have a strong incentive to over-exaggerate the success of their business. To combat this potential issue, each company must go through these three critical processes:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, each business goes through a rigorous two-week program where they are required to provide key information regarding eleven factors of investability. This process is characterized by strict deadlines and high attention to detail. We specifically created this system to weed out SME owners who are not serious enough to be ready for an investment.</li>
<li>Second, we verify the company’s financial information through the value chain. Here, we look at both the business’ suppliers and distributors to assess whether there are any inaccuracies in the data that they presented to us.</li>
<li>Third, we employ a due diligence expert to meet the owners, suppliers, and distributors in person, to verify the viability, integrity, and condition of the company.  </li>

<p><strong>Making sure investments are used correctly:</strong></p>
<p>During the two week vetting period, we devote the majority of our time to validating the company’s business model and future growth plans.

I made American flag afghans and sold them to parents whose children were serving overseas.  I gained a pretty good following and transitioned over to clothing and accessories. For the past 14 years,  I've run my business in the background all while working full time, raising 2 children on my own,  through breast cancer,  college and domestic violence.  Expanding the PassionIt's now 2015 and my passion for Black Pearl had been reignited. During my 2x cancer battles,  I learned how important it is for us to live life on our terms.  Not to run out and hurt others or anything but if you want to be bolder in your style and be more expressive,  then that should be an option.  Unfortunately, society has us bamboozled: ""Sure, be expressive,  but not like that. "" I love giving others the opportunity to be expressive via unique clothing and accessories. I love to crochet.  I mean,  I LOVE to crochet! I even crochet for a hobby!  To see what I can create with a hook and some yarn is nothing short of fascinating!Now it's time to expand this passion from online to offline. To create an environment where others can come in,  be fitted and walk out with pieces that suit their individuality and inner hippie. I want to open a bohemian shop with pretties and a Wanderlust spirit inside of a converted mill that is a hipster's haven. I drool just thinking of it!   An indie movie theater,  café,  live music,  yoga studio, shops and so much more are already established in the building. Along with the weekly and monthly events, the foot traffic would be fantastic for Black Pearl!Allocation of FundsBut I need your help to make it happen! Here's what is needed to get the shop open, running and self-sustaining.  $1,200 3 months lease$500 Build website$500 Yarn $1500 Improper Bostonian and Hippo Marketing (Local area cultural arts newspaper and magazine)$500 Store build out and interior design$250 Credit card transaction feesTotal $4,550.

<p></p>
<p>I’m the daughter of a former police officer, and have grown up around first responders and military members. I was born 4 months premature, and faced many challenges in my first few years of life. I defied the odds and the doctors’ grim predictions, and function well and lead a completely normal life.</p>
<p>Since June 2007, I’ve used my knowledge of cultures, religions, and languages (Spanish, Arabic, and American Sign Language), my personal experiences, and my skills in moulage, to assist police, military, EMS, and CERT civilian responders in their training. My characters and scenarios teach them how to handle a variety of different emergency scenarios, illnesses and injuries, and cultural and language challenges. This broadens their understanding and prepares them for any number of situations that they will face.</p>In order for the training to be effective, it needs to be as detailed and realistic as possible. You can only do so much with a plastic rescue dummy wearing a tag that says, ""Gunshot wound to chest."" It's much more effective for responders to be confronted with a realistic-looking wound, and have to figure out how to handle the blood, gore, and serious injury. Unfortunately, it’s often difficult for emergency response groups and military training personnel to have access to quality moulage/FX supplies and artists who know how to use them.

</div></div>","Saving lives with creative art. I create life-like medical moulage (realistic injury simulation effects) for realistic simulation training for emergency responders.


I’m the daughter of a former police officer, and have grown up around first responders and military members. I was born 4 months premature, and faced many challenges in my first few years of life. I defied the odds and the doctors’ grim predictions, and function well and lead a completely normal life.
Since June 2007, I’ve used my knowledge of cultures, religions, and languages (Spanish, Arabic, and American Sign Language), my personal experiences, and my skills in moulage, to assist police, military, EMS, and CERT civilian responders in their training. My characters and scenarios teach them how to handle a variety of different emergency scenarios, illnesses and injuries, and cultural and language challenges. This broadens their understanding and prepares them for any number of situations that they will face.In order for the training to be effective, it needs to be as detailed and realistic as possible. You can only do so much with a plastic rescue dummy wearing a tag that says, ""Gunshot wound to chest."" It's much more effective for responders to be confronted with a realistic-looking wound, and have to figure out how to handle the blood, gore, and serious injury. Unfortunately, it’s often difficult for emergency response groups and military training personnel to have access to quality moulage/FX supplies and artists who know how to use them. This is why trained and knowledgeable personnel like me, and projects like mine, are so important.You can see pictures of my work in my Flickr album HERE.------   What I Need 
The economy hasn’t been kind to my family. After multiple job losses, my parents and I narrowly avoided losing our house to foreclosure in December 2013. We are doing better now, but are still working hard to get back on our feet. 
I’ve been hired to provide training support and moulage makeup for several exercises around the US in 2015. This will be a great learning experience, as well as a much-needed paycheck! 
The moulage requirements for these exercises mean that I need to buy some new supplies, ones that I can’t work without. Depending on the exercise scenario and the conditions that we are working in, there are specific requirements (waterproof, able to last for several hours, etc) and specific materials that we need to use. 
I’m “between a rock and a hard place” – without these supplies, I won’t be able to work, which means I won’t get a paycheck. But I don’t have enough money to buy them. 
Most of the groups that I work with don't have any moulage materials or anyone trained in how to use them, which is why they rely on me. Any materials that I use, I have to purchase myself. I work with so many different groups - asking all of them to provide materials for me for all the exercises simply isn't practical! 
The total cost of the supplies that I need to purchase is $1,200. This will be a one-time supply purchase; the moulage pieces that will be made from these supplies are re-usable.
Liquid material to make wound pieces – $170.00

-------
   The Impact Most of the exercises with local responders, here in my home town, have been as an unpaid volunteer. I do it because I love it; it is my way to give back to the responders who have done so much for me. That was my starting point, and it’s opened the door for several other wonderful opportunities. I’ve gotten to work with the US military, and several agencies that provide training for responders around the US and the world.

Having these supplies will open up MANY more opportunities for me to participate in exercises, here in my community and in other states (and other countries). The requirements for larger, longer exercises are different than the requirements for shorter, smaller exercises. Having these materials would allow me to do whatever they need, so I would be able to participate in more opportunities when they came along. 
More exercise opportunities for me means more training courses being conducted, which means more people being trained in important skills. 
Civilians: The CERT (Community Emergency Response Team) program trains civilians in disaster preparedness, search & rescue, and emergency first aid, so they can help their family, neighbors, and community members in a disaster.

We have a Right To Know.</h3><p>The 4th <i>March Against Monsanto</i> rally and protest takes place on Saturday, May 23, 2015 at Westlake Park. We rally at 12 NOON and march to The Gates Foundation for protest at approximately 2:30 PM. March ends at 3 PM. This is a family-friendly event! </p><ul>
<li>We are a dedicated group of activists, some of whom brought you the first three #MAM events, including MAM 3.0 last May. The ongoing dirty dealings of the GMA (Grocery Manufacturer's Association) continue to affect our right to labeling laws. The DARK Act is a threat (again). We are calling for a new GMO Labeling Initiative in Washington State, an end to Food Deserts, and demand that the Gates Foundation divest from Monsanto &amp; Cargill. Protecting Biodiversity is imperative.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Your contributions are <i>greatly</i> needed to help us cover the expenses of producing this rally &amp; march <i>(permits, tents, tables, tech &amp; sound equipment, and so much more)</i>. We're creating literature to help inform Seattle citizens of the need to continue the fight for Label Laws on ALL GMO foods, and to educate our population about the need to protect Biodiversity.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>YOU can help us provide a family-friendly event that will bring our community together to speak out about the dangers of GMO Agriculture, demand labeling, and to educate more and more people about Food Safety issues. Although we successfully lobbied the City of Seattle to BAN the use of Neonics in all parks and city properties, we will continue to educate folks about these dangerous pesticides, which are responsible for harming bees and other important pollinators! Make your garden toxin-free! Learn how at one of our info booths. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Any surplus funds, after costs to cover the event, will be routed directly back to the parent NGO (March-Against-Monsanto.com) as well as used to help start a #MAMSeattle 501(c) non-profit organization, made up of coalition members, that will be used for on-going education projects, additional actions, and to continue providing Seattle with a march every May!

<li>Providing healthcare and physiotherapy</li>
<li>Providing equipment, whether wheelchairs, boards, protective gloves, medical supplies or training - both professional and physical, to help people become more autonomous and independent.</li>
</ul>The stigma associated with disability in India can be far more intense and restrictive than in Western countries. The infrastructure, mentality of society and will to accommodate disabled people and treat them as normal human beings is seriously lacking. </div><div> By contributing to this campaign, you will not just be giving the means to help these individuals through the means mentioned above, you will be helping to restore their dignity and give them a chance to live a more normal existence.   </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>There is no end to the work that can be done in New Delhi, let alone in India, to help the disabled.  We have set an ambitious target for the funding we are hoping to raise, but every contribution, however large or small, will go to help. You will find some contributions with perks for yourself, others where the benefits will be the knowledge and satisfaction of providing concrete means of support. </p>
<p>Each fundable item has a tanglible benefit linked to it. Please see our perks for more details. For the perks where you can receive merchandise such as necklaces, cards, bags etc. your support will have a double impact as all these products are sourced from an NGO where the proceeds from our purchases will go to help other disabled communities. </p>
<p>Whether or not we reach the fundraising target, we will be able to provide care and equipment to the much needy disabled people in Delhi; The beneficiaries will include not only those we have already connected with, but also many others, depending on the funds raised. The main beneficiary organisation of the fundraising campaign is a Delhi based non-profit organisation, specialised in empowering and aiding spinal cord injured people in India. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>How your contribution will make an impact</h3> <p>Can you imagine losing both your legs but still being able to scoot about on a skateboard? Or being paralysed in your legs, but still playing rugby - wheelchair rugby that is...?  Guddu, our ambassador featured in our video and friends who live at the special home for spinal cord injured people in Delhi, which will benefit from the fundraising, are witnesses to the fact that despite physical difficulties, they are able to enjoy life to the full. </p>
<p>The mentoring and counselling, as well as the physical care and medical treatment which organisations such as ESCIP provide real empowerment to these individuals. </p>
<p>For others, it could be just a question of receiving a pair of gloves and a proper wheelchair (as opposed to makeshift chairs), which will make their lives on the streets of Delhi infinitely more comfortable and accessible.  </p>
<p>Having raised funds for various causes and NGOs in the past, through a variety of means, whether selling artwork, made by children, organising charity concerts and dinners or online fundraising, we can attest to amazing results and immense satisfaction achieved, especially when close to the cause and in direct contact with the beneficiary organisations or individuals. </p>
<p>In the case of helping the physically challenged in India, who not only suffer from their disability, but also due to their exclusion from society, the impact is all the more direct and their gratitude all the more intense.  </p>
<p> </p>
<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> The main challenge to the success of this campaign is to ensure that the beneficiary organisations are themselves transparent and operationally efficient. By helping smaller organisations, we are able to monitor the use of the funds more closely and ensure that the funds are being deployed precisely for what they were intended and not being diluted by huge admin, marketing and personnel costs. </p>
<p>Given our direct contact and close association with the organisation and individuals who will benefit, we are able to ensure optimal usage and efficiency. </p>
<p>Accountability is essential and close collaboration with the organisation's chartered accountants, who work for a number of trusts and non profits in India of the organisation means we are fully confident that the funds will be well used. </p>

                   Why IndieGoGo? Well, we could go a more conventional route and take on massive amounts of loans from a bank but we don't do anything like anyone else so why would we do this in a conventional way? We are fiercely independent and we like to forge our own path. We also like to do it with as many quality people as possible. </div><div><br/></div><div>When we were trying to determine which funding route to pursue, we looked for an option that would allow us to involve our incredibly passionate community of clients and students. We looked for a way to get new people involved with our community. We searched for a funding option that would allow everyone involved to feel a sense of accomplishment and ownership. Crowd Funding turned out to be the perfect option!  <br/>

                   Anything creative requires a LOT of time and can quickly become expensive. This particular venture is no different. We have worked hard to buy equipment piece by piece in stages to keep the overhead cost down and consequently keep prices down. We will do the same with the next phases of the company. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are currently operating in a 500 sq ft space and we have enough music equipment for that space. We are seeking to grow to a minimum of 2500 to 3000 sq ft for the next phase. We would like to grow to 5000 sq ft and include a performance hall / project gallery but it will depend upon how much we raise. <br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>To give you an idea of how quickly costs can add up, here are some examples:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>EQUIPMENT:</div>
<div>     - 1 digital piano = $1200 X 7 for piano room = $8400</div>
<div>     - 1 drumset = $2000 X 6 for drum set room = $12000</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As you can see, equipment is expensive. And that's just two of the items needed. Once you go through all of the creative disciplines and a performance hall, the cost of equipment is substantial.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>LEASE:</div>
<div>     - finishing out a leased space with the necessary finishings for a recording studio and creative academy will easily run $50 per sq ft or more depending on choices. </div>
<div>     - Build out cost estimate = $50 X 2500 sq ft = $125,000</div>
<div>     - RENT = ~15 sq ft/year X 3000 sq ft = $45,000</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>PERSONNEL:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>     - the goal is to raise enough money to cover several months of salary for each employee to get them trained and fully operational so that their position pays for itself through labor. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As you can see, the dollars add up quickly and we have only listed a fraction of the costs here. Look at the Stretch Goals at the top of the page for a general overview of the total costs. </div>

</h3>I hear this almost daily from people, both local and tourist alike.  And I wholeheartedly agree!  Our bakery has been in operation for two years now as a custom order bakery, and we are now ready to take the next step.  We are gearing up to open a retail location in the heart of Seaside in the Gilbert District.  <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>It takes a village to raise a loaf of bread!<br/>
</h3>So as we get down to the very end of the final stretch, we realize there are a few pieces of equipment that still are out of our budget.<br/><br/><ul>
<li>a proofer for our dough ($1500)<br/>
</li>
<li>a larger mixer ($3-4000)</li>
<li>installation of both ($500-$1000)<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These two machines are pretty vital in bringing the freshest breads and baked goods to the North Coast in the quantity that people are asking for.  And I would hate to turn away customers because I was unable to provide enough loaves to feed the masses! (I'm by no means a ""fishes and loaves"" miracle worker!)<br/></p>

</div></div>","""Seaside needs a bakery!""
I hear this almost daily from people, both local and tourist alike.  And I wholeheartedly agree!  Our bakery has been in operation for two years now as a custom order bakery, and we are now ready to take the next step.  We are gearing up to open a retail location in the heart of Seaside in the Gilbert District.  
  It takes a village to raise a loaf of bread!
So as we get down to the very end of the final stretch, we realize there are a few pieces of equipment that still are out of our budget.
a proofer for our dough ($1500)

a larger mixer ($3-4000)
installation of both ($500-$1000)


These two machines are pretty vital in bringing the freshest breads and baked goods to the North Coast in the quantity that people are asking for.  And I would hate to turn away customers because I was unable to provide enough loaves to feed the masses! (I'm by no means a ""fishes and loaves"" miracle worker!)
  And then, there was you...

</h3> <p>Hi there! My name is Laura Sprinkle, and I am a Gut Health Coach, author, speaker, and wellness entrepreneur! I dream of a world where everyone knows just how valuable they are, and has a happy &amp; peaceful GUT! What do I mean by that? Well, that the majority of folks nowadays have gut issues, whether or not they know it. So my mission is to bring light to the subject &amp; empower people to heal their guts holistically.</p>
<p>What is the situation today?</p> <ul> <li>Rampant degenerative disease</li> <li>Low self-esteem &amp; lack of self-care</li> <li>Health issues galore</li>
<li>Questioning place and purpose in the world</li> </ul> <p>Ask yourself: is this normal?! The answer is NO. </p>
<p>That is why I have written She's Got Guts, a simple, yet comprehensive, guide to creating a personalized healing action plan! This book covers the who, what, where, when, why, and how of self healing - and you don't need to be a science nerd like me to understand it. </p>
<p>I'm asking for donations to She's Got Guts because I want to be able to spread the message of health &amp; happiness in a BIG way - and I need your help to accomplish that. </p>
<p>Not only do I want to get this book into the hands of those who will use it &amp; thrive, but I also want to teach outstanding programs and work with people 1:1 to create a life they love. All of your help is SO appreciated, thank you for your abundant love &amp; contribution! </p>

I've done the research and found out that there is a better way. Commercial scanners are much faster than the flatbed scanners many of us have at home. They have feeders, but they are specially made to be gentle enough not to damage photos. They can even scan both sides of the photo at the same time, so that the scanned images include any information that is on the back. The scanner I intend to use would scan 85 images per minute at 300 dpi.

</div></div>","Need Help With Your Photos?  These days most of us are taking digital photos, and we're 
taking so many of them that they're overwhelming us. How do you find a 
photo to share it with family? I can help clients get their photos and slides organized and 
learn how to keep them organized. They will be able to keep track of the photos of family milestones and share them.
What about the older photos, that aren't digital? The photos you took before digital cameras became so common. The 
ones your parents took. The ones your grandparents took or had taken. Maybe you've 
got some even older than that. You want to share them but scanning the 
contents of that box could take the rest of your life. I've been there, 
and I want to help you with your box, boxes, or albums of old photos. How Will This Work?

<div> <h3>The Braw project</h3> <p></p>
<p>Braw is beer for creative people. The Braw project is not just about brewing great craft beers: the experience doesn’t stop with an empty bottle. The bottle itself will be an object of inspiration and study. We are collaborating with the best creatives in the world to design artworks for labels for our beers. You will taste our beer and collect the artworks, downloading it from our website also in a psd or vector format to see how they did it.</p>
<p>During the last 20 months we have been working at Braw to set up everything and we did several experiments to define all the recipes of our beers. Initially we are going to produce an <b>IPA</b> (Brainstorm), an <b>Imperial Stout</b> (Moodboard), a <b>Porter </b>(Viewport) and a <b>Pilsener</b> (Break)</p>
<p>Now we need <b>your support to make our dream come true. </b>We want to brew beer for creatives, a beer that helps them in every step of their workflow and study.</p>
<p>Our beers will be delivered world wide.</p>

Braw is beer for creative people. The Braw project is not just about brewing great craft beers: the experience doesn’t stop with an empty bottle. The bottle itself will be an object of inspiration and study. We are collaborating with the best creatives in the world to design artworks for labels for our beers. You will taste our beer and collect the artworks, downloading it from our website also in a psd or vector format to see how they did it.
During the last 20 months we have been working at Braw to set up everything and we did several experiments to define all the recipes of our beers. Initially we are going to produce an IPA (Brainstorm), an Imperial Stout (Moodboard), a Porter (Viewport) and a Pilsener (Break)
Now we need your support to make our dream come true. We want to brew beer for creatives, a beer that helps them in every step of their workflow and study.
Our beers will be delivered world wide.

<p></p>
<p>In April 1889 the Unassigned Lands of Oklahoma Territory were
opened to any and all adventurers who would stake their claim to 160-acre
tracts in the land run. C.E. Pauly was among them, a rugged young settler on
horseback who rode across the red dirt prairie where Native red men had lived
for thousands of years. Pauly claimed a little corner of the world that day
just west of a town now called Edmond.</p>
<p>Near
the turn of the century, the settlers longed for a church. They were meeting in
homes or one-room schoolhouses, but they needed a place to gather—a real
place—so they built one and called it Hopewell Baptist Church. And when it burned they built another. In 1947 a
congregation of little more than 200 farmers and oilfield workers outgrew their crowded clapboard church on the prairie.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>If you're not stuck on that</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The church leaders went to the University of Oklahoma's School
of Architecture, hoping some student work might fit their building project budget. What they got
was beyond what they ever imagined: the creative genius of its lead architect
Bruce Goff. Professor Goff's buildings across America were famous, nothing less than “innovative
and imaginative” according to experts. Happily, Goff liked these fellows from
Hopewell Baptist Church. When the elders asked him, ""How about a building
made of concrete blocks?"" Goff replied, ""If you're not stuck on that,
let's do something else!""</p>
<p>Using
surplus pipe from nearby oilfields and native stone quarried by church members,
Goff designed what would later be called the ""cathedral of sacred
spaces"" and ""the most unusual church in America."" From his blueprints
the church was built by the wits and sweat and determination of a humble
congregation working many long nights after their day jobs. The building took
shape—formed from 1,000 tons of drill stem pipe—and the workers named its 12 trusses
after the apostles. The last was called Judas because it gave them
trouble. A symbol of Native American inhabitants of the land with its
conical style and red-shingled roof, and the booming oil industry with its
welded steel trusses, Goff's building brought the energy of Oklahoma to life on
that prairie.  </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>

<p>Sadly, the Tepee experienced many challenges. Leaks began to
spring in the roof and around angular windows, and nearby road construction
triggered continual flooding into the lower level. Asbestos was added to
climatize it, but years later was removed at significant cost. The TP’s doors were finally locked and Goff's once-sacred space had reached its most challenging low. While mold and
rodents had their way, its only other visitors were birds and termites. Its congregation worshiped in another building on the property and the most
unusual church in America could only stand watch on its corner, dark and
silent.</p>

<h3>Adaptive re-use as an events center</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Significant for a growing metropolitan region, the building is being adapted—repurposed—for use as a modern events center with historic distinction. When completed it will offer beautiful, adaptive space with quality acoustics, community programming, and the latest technology and staffing for events. Plans include creative and performing arts, community workshops, business training, educational conferences, historic tours, weddings and celebrations, and children's and charitable programs, to name a few. The new facility will provide historic elements throughout to connect visitors with Oklahoma history, American Indian history, architectural appreciation and more. </span><br/></p>
<h3>Funding: You're one of the team!</h3>
<p>Through generous contributions, the building rehabilitation for this one-of-a-kind historic structure is underway! The Foundation has nearly completed Phase I of the work for approximately $120,000 with additional in-kind contributions of $60,000. <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Following preliminary pre-design work necessary for architectural elevations, a targeted feasibility study and preparation of a business plan, The Hopewell Heritage Foundation seeks $220,000 for Phase II, FULL REDESIGN that includes the architectural Master Planning, Schematic Design &amp; Construction Administration. </p>

<p>Butzer was named a recipient of the American Institute of Architects 2016 Thomas Jefferson Award for Public Architecture. According to AIA, ""the award recognizes excellence in architectural advocacy and achievement."" The AIA identified Butzer's leadership and innovative work, noting:</p>
<p>""Butzer is a gifted and accomplished architect who has built his career in Oklahoma City by dedicating himself to improving the built landscape and enriching the fundamental civic dignity of the city.""</p>
<p>Butzer and wife Torrey founded the firm responsible for OKC landmark projects such as the Skydance Bridge, the Oklahoma City National Memorial, Century Center and numerous other projects. He was recently deemed interim dean of the University of Oklahoma College of Architecture.</p>
<p>It is a great  honor to have this firm working toward the rehabilitation of the building through creation of a master plan and design work. The total project completion is $2.5 million to see this gift of organic architecture revitalized for public access. Your generous donations, endowments and in-kind contributions will allow Phase II to be completed in preparation for Phase III, ""bricks and mortar.""</p>

homes or one-room schoolhouses, but they needed a place to gather—a real
place—so they built one and called it Hopewell Baptist Church. And when it burned they built another. In 1947 a
congregation of little more than 200 farmers and oilfield workers outgrew their crowded clapboard church on the prairie.


If you're not stuck on that

The church leaders went to the University of Oklahoma's School
of Architecture, hoping some student work might fit their building project budget. What they got
was beyond what they ever imagined: the creative genius of its lead architect
Bruce Goff. Professor Goff's buildings across America were famous, nothing less than “innovative
and imaginative” according to experts. Happily, Goff liked these fellows from
Hopewell Baptist Church. When the elders asked him, ""How about a building
made of concrete blocks?"" Goff replied, ""If you're not stuck on that,
let's do something else!""
Using
surplus pipe from nearby oilfields and native stone quarried by church members,
Goff designed what would later be called the ""cathedral of sacred
spaces"" and ""the most unusual church in America."" From his blueprints
the church was built by the wits and sweat and determination of a humble
congregation working many long nights after their day jobs. The building took
shape—formed from 1,000 tons of drill stem pipe—and the workers named its 12 trusses
after the apostles. The last was called Judas because it gave them
trouble. A symbol of Native American inhabitants of the land with its
conical style and red-shingled roof, and the booming oil industry with its
welded steel trusses, Goff's building brought the energy of Oklahoma to life on
that prairie.  




Sadly, the Tepee experienced many challenges. Leaks began to
spring in the roof and around angular windows, and nearby road construction
triggered continual flooding into the lower level. Asbestos was added to
climatize it, but years later was removed at significant cost. The TP’s doors were finally locked and Goff's once-sacred space had reached its most challenging low. While mold and
rodents had their way, its only other visitors were birds and termites. Its congregation worshiped in another building on the property and the most
unusual church in America could only stand watch on its corner, dark and
silent.


Until
now. Now—in 2016. This is the year of  the 'TP'! 


National Register of Historic PlacesListed on the National Register of Historic Places under its original name, Hopewell Baptist Church, this building will see its space transformed for adaptive re-use as an exciting and unique events center. The Hopewell Heritage Foundation, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization announces, ""This is the year of the 'TP'!""




Adaptive re-use as an events center
Significant for a growing metropolitan region, the building is being adapted—repurposed—for use as a modern events center with historic distinction. When completed it will offer beautiful, adaptive space with quality acoustics, community programming, and the latest technology and staffing for events. Plans include creative and performing arts, community workshops, business training, educational conferences, historic tours, weddings and celebrations, and children's and charitable programs, to name a few. The new facility will provide historic elements throughout to connect visitors with Oklahoma history, American Indian history, architectural appreciation and more. 
Funding: You're one of the team!
Through generous contributions, the building rehabilitation for this one-of-a-kind historic structure is underway! The Foundation has nearly completed Phase I of the work for approximately $120,000 with additional in-kind contributions of $60,000. 
Following preliminary pre-design work necessary for architectural elevations, a targeted feasibility study and preparation of a business plan, The Hopewell Heritage Foundation seeks $220,000 for Phase II, FULL REDESIGN that includes the architectural Master Planning, Schematic Design & Construction Administration. 



The Foundation is pleased to announce the selection of award-winning architect Hans Butzer, AIA, LEEP AP, AK NW, and the Oklahoma City firm of Butzer Architects and Urbanism (BUA) for the work of architectural redesign of the Bruce Goff ""tepee"".
Butzer was named a recipient of the American Institute of Architects 2016 Thomas Jefferson Award for Public Architecture. According to AIA, ""the award recognizes excellence in architectural advocacy and achievement."" The AIA identified Butzer's leadership and innovative work, noting:
""Butzer is a gifted and accomplished architect who has built his career in Oklahoma City by dedicating himself to improving the built landscape and enriching the fundamental civic dignity of the city.""
Butzer and wife Torrey founded the firm responsible for OKC landmark projects such as the Skydance Bridge, the Oklahoma City National Memorial, Century Center and numerous other projects. He was recently deemed interim dean of the University of Oklahoma College of Architecture.
It is a great  honor to have this firm working toward the rehabilitation of the building through creation of a master plan and design work. The total project completion is $2.5 million to see this gift of organic architecture revitalized for public access. Your generous donations, endowments and in-kind contributions will allow Phase II to be completed in preparation for Phase III, ""bricks and mortar.""

It is an exciting undertaking to honor the great work of Bruce Goff and to revive the legacy of earlier generations on the red dirt prairie. It is creative and important work, connecting shared histories of the American Indian, early Oklahoma settlers, architecture of the 20th century and a hard-working congregation who began with only a love for creating a house of worship and a very unique ""pipe dream"".",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

It
was on a hot Friday afternoon in San Jose, Costa
Rica, while picking up Shabbat groceries with my friend
Fernando, that he suggested we pick up a bottle of “Caol Ila 12”.
Little did he know that although I enjoyed a good dram, I had been
conservatively sticking to the lighter, sweeter whiskies that are
just easier for a novice’s palate to appreciate, but that I had
never ventured into the great flavor that Islay or other full flavor
whiskies have to offer. As we sipped that bottle on Shabbat
afternoon, I realized that I had been missing out on something, and
that was the beginning of my realization that each and every whisky
is truly unique and has something wonderful to offer. Many whiskies
later, my palate now more mature, my “family” at the small
Shulounge minyan  whom I would meet every Shabbat for prayers and a
few l’chaims made me realize that any whisky tastes so much better
when it is enjoyed with others, and this is where the dream to make a
delicious world class whisky that will challenge the palate and bring
people together was born. I didn't know when or how to begin, but I
started learning everything there was to know about making good
whisky which raised my appreciation of whisky to a whole new level.
The quality of the water, the malted grains, the endless
possibilities of yeast strains, the fermentation of the wort or mash,
the distillation of the clear spirit, and finally the aging in casks
which give it all of its color and up to 70% of its flavor,
fascinated me .</p>

In
the spring of 2014 on a trip to Israel with my family we arrived at
the town of Katzrin in the Golan Heights and fell in love with the

<p><b>The Absinthe story:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
Now
that I was moving along and had committed myself, I realized the real
financial challenge of distilling and putting away casks of whisky
for at least 3 years. Every business needs to sell in order to
survive, and I was searching for a spirit I could be passionate about
and sell immediately while our whiskey was aging. I didn't just want
to make any clear spirit just because the market would buy it, I
wanted to connect to it as well, so I experimented with a few
different thing that at first excited me, but it wasn’t until
October that I found my connection to absinthe. I had heard of it
before, but after having a taste at my friend Yona's, I became very
curious, and the more I read about it the more I realized I could
make this, so after looking through many, many recipes I found one I
thought I liked. I made it, and it turned out to be an instant hit.
Little did I know that a little over a century ago, when my
great-great grandfather fell through the ice while fishing to make a
living and died, my great-great grandmother started serving absinthe
in the estaminet (the name used in the north of France for an
establishment that served alcohol and tobacco) she had opened to be
able to support her family. My mother, who revealed this to me after
tasting my absinthe, told me she still has the last absinthe spoon in
the family from this Estaminet.</p>

Hearing
this brought my enthusiasm for absinthe to a yet a higher level and
the decision was made that absinthe would be the spirit we would sell
while our whisky ages. We named it the “Holy Spirit” because the
absinthe plant is known in France as the holy herb, and we distill it
in the Holy Land and it truly is a ‘holy spirit’.</p>

<p><b>Where you come in:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
So
far we have invested close to $100,000, but still are in need an
additional $120,000 for renovations and rent for our 3-year plan. At
present, we have $60,000 which will cover renovating our new rental
location, and we need another $60,000 to cover our rent for the 3
years. From past business experience we know that paying rent every
month can be a burden, especially when our product is resting in
casks... so we have decided to reach out to you and give you the
opportunity to help us sell some of this whisky and absinthe now so
that we can cover our rent for the next 3 years and have the ability
to focus on making the best whisky possible without having investors
waiting for a return on their money, or bank loan awaiting repayment
- just quality product development. </p>
<p>
All
funds raised above our goal will be dedicated to the purchase of
casks and grain to strengthen our inventory and put us in a position
of strength when we approach our potential investors 3 years from now
to build our ultimate distillery.</p>

</div></div>","My
name is David Zibell, and I was born in France, raised
in Canada, Israel and the US. I recently dropped my
real estate career in Canada to follow my dream of distilling a new
style of whisky in a place I truly can call home, the Golan Heights
of Israel. I've taken great steps, invested lots of time and money,
and am already seeing great results. And now I need your help to take
it to the next level -- let's create the first whisky to be produced
in the Golan Heights and realize dreams together.
Check out this interview which covers things nicely and clearly: http://www.voiceofisrael.com/distilling-whisky-...
Whisky Gospel early preview on our spirits: http://whiskygospel.com/2015/06/01/a-very-early...

My Whisky Adventure:




It
was on a hot Friday afternoon in San Jose, Costa
Rica, while picking up Shabbat groceries with my friend
Fernando, that he suggested we pick up a bottle of “Caol Ila 12”.
Little did he know that although I enjoyed a good dram, I had been
conservatively sticking to the lighter, sweeter whiskies that are
just easier for a novice’s palate to appreciate, but that I had
never ventured into the great flavor that Islay or other full flavor
whiskies have to offer. As we sipped that bottle on Shabbat
afternoon, I realized that I had been missing out on something, and
that was the beginning of my realization that each and every whisky
is truly unique and has something wonderful to offer. Many whiskies
later, my palate now more mature, my “family” at the small
Shulounge minyan  whom I would meet every Shabbat for prayers and a
few l’chaims made me realize that any whisky tastes so much better
when it is enjoyed with others, and this is where the dream to make a
delicious world class whisky that will challenge the palate and bring
people together was born. I didn't know when or how to begin, but I
started learning everything there was to know about making good
whisky which raised my appreciation of whisky to a whole new level.
The quality of the water, the malted grains, the endless
possibilities of yeast strains, the fermentation of the wort or mash,
the distillation of the clear spirit, and finally the aging in casks
which give it all of its color and up to 70% of its flavor,
fascinated me .


Make your Dreams Come True, Just Do It!:


In
the spring of 2014 on a trip to Israel with my family we arrived at
the town of Katzrin in the Golan Heights and fell in love with the
place. It was then I decided to put this dream into action when I saw
that the abundance of natural springs


the fields of wild barley and the quality of life 
would
make
this the perfect place to create a new whiskey. I immediately ordered
a copper pot still, a couple of fermentation tanks, and by that
summer I was in the Golan Heights
distilling my first single malt spirit, and one of the first few
Israeli whiskies to be.

  

The Absinthe story:


Now
that I was moving along and had committed myself, I realized the real
financial challenge of distilling and putting away casks of whisky
for at least 3 years. Every business needs to sell in order to
survive, and I was searching for a spirit I could be passionate about
and sell immediately while our whiskey was aging. I didn't just want
to make any clear spirit just because the market would buy it, I
wanted to connect to it as well, so I experimented with a few
different thing that at first excited me, but it wasn’t until
October that I found my connection to absinthe. I had heard of it
before, but after having a taste at my friend Yona's, I became very
curious, and the more I read about it the more I realized I could
make this, so after looking through many, many recipes I found one I
thought I liked. I made it, and it turned out to be an instant hit.
Little did I know that a little over a century ago, when my
great-great grandfather fell through the ice while fishing to make a
living and died, my great-great grandmother started serving absinthe
in the estaminet (the name used in the north of France for an
establishment that served alcohol and tobacco) she had opened to be
able to support her family. My mother, who revealed this to me after
tasting my absinthe, told me she still has the last absinthe spoon in
the family from this Estaminet.
 
Hearing
this brought my enthusiasm for absinthe to a yet a higher level and
the decision was made that absinthe would be the spirit we would sell
while our whisky ages. We named it the “Holy Spirit” because the
absinthe plant is known in France as the holy herb, and we distill it
in the Holy Land and it truly is a ‘holy spirit’.


Where We Are Holding:
-We have succesfully created a single malt, a corn mash and a single malted rye spirit that is now 7 months old and on it's way to become a whisky.
-We have three 225 liter casks aging to fulfill perks from this campaign.

We are sourcing our water from the local Salukia spring which is just down the road from us.

- We have a supplier of English Malted Barley and Malted Rye and a supplier of american corn.
- We
have come to an agreement with a local winery, The Golan Heights
Winery (who in my humble opinion makes the best wines in Israel) to
supply us with casks that have once held Port and other red and white
wines. Some of these casks will be used fresh after wine is dumped by
the winery, and others will be carefully shaved, and toasted to bring
out the fruitiness of the wine they once held and then charred to caramelize the sugars in the wood.

- We
are waiting to receive our new Stupfler still, a revolutionary still
that not only is highly efficient and environmentally friendly but
makes a spirit of quality I've never before experienced; this still
will produce 220 litters of spirit in a 12 hour period, making it
more than enough to get us through our first 3 years of operation.

- We have designed our labels and have found a beautiful bottle from the revolutionary bottle makers at SAVERGLASS to hold our fine spirit.



- We have created a very fine Absinthe using organic herbs in the traditional method without adding sugar or color using only the best quality ingredients and have bottles waiting to be shipped for perks in this campaign.

- All our whiskies and spirits will be kosher certified lemehadrin by Katsrin chief Rabbi, Rabbi Levi.
We have found a great piece of land to build our distillery.
 
But
before we approach any investors for help to realize that part of our
dream, we will be dedicating the next 3 years to operating as a
micro-distillery in order to improve our product and test the market,
We have found a building to rent in the Katzrin’s industrial zone
for the next 3 years where we can distill and store our spirit as it
ages.

*************************UPDATE**************************
Thanks to all of you who participated in this campaign we took the next step and signed a lease, we were also able to prepay our rent for the first year with the funds raised so far, we hope to continue selling to raise enough funds to cover our rent for an additional 2 years and to cover all our other fixed expenses. Thank you again you are all part of our success!


Where you come in:


So
far we have invested close to $100,000, but still are in need an
additional $120,000 for renovations and rent for our 3-year plan. At

Building Lease/Mortgage ($3000+ per month) 

Our most major expense, is the distilling equipment itself. The next major hurdle, is the building and the licenses. We need a federal license from the TTB and a Virginia license from ABC. These are also not cheap, and take awhile to acquire. We then need a building to put all of our equipment in, and we need to get it inspected and approved.

If we do not reach our entire goal, we'll use the funds we receive to explore other options, such as a cooperative with another distillery, leasing equipment, getting less expensive items and starting smaller scale, or some other option to get us off the ground.

Awesome Perks For Contributing
We have quite a few perks, in all price ranges. They range from just plain donations for $10, shirts at $25, vouchers for liquor, custom labels for our products, and even really adventurous stuff, for you big spenders, like coming down to the distillery and helping make a whole batch of your own custom product!
   

How will my contribution make a difference?
Every dollar raised will help immensely to push us towards our goal. Your money won't just help us but it will:


Create jobs
Stimulate the local economy
10% will go to charity


Not only that, but you will be directly sponsoring bringing people together and creating memorable life moments around a glass of our Williamson Wagner Whiskey.





Don't forget that 10% of all proceeds from this campaign will go to the Roanoke Valley SPCA. Help animals like Brutus here find a forever home!





   What are the risks?
There are risks involved when starting any company, but we have a few advantages to be successful.  We are 100% self owned, and we have a clear vision for what we want to accomplish. Craft distilling is on the rise, and has grown from less than 100 craft distillers in 2003 to over 600 today.
We would be only the 2nd legal distillery local to southwest Virginia, so there is plenty of room to grow in the market and be successful. We would also be the first one located in Roanoke.
Demand for whiskey is steadily increasing, and in 2013, whiskey sales achieved their fastest growth rate since the 1960’s.
    How else can I help?
The best way you can help, is to get the word out to all of your friends, colleagues, associates, your mail man, your mother-in-law, everyone!
You can use the provided sharing tools to post on Facebook, Twitter, or email this page to your friends.
Even sharing it with one person helps so much, so help us get the word out!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are also offering the once in a life time opportunity to join us in the audience to film our first original content as it will be filmed in front of a live audience with 2 UK TV chefs. 

Your chance to be a TV star and appear next to the chefs in the TV series The funds will also go in to R&D, adding more content and completing the apps.
Creating original content that is exclusive to the app to drive more viewers and establish ourselves as a global media company.    
Risks & Challenges

 In every project there is a risk but we believe that this will be successful, having a TV chef and a tech guy join up means you get the food part and the technical part being completed by people who know their business.

The first mobile app focused on meeting new interesting people within your university and company networks.







There have never been more ways to access people with all the social apps available to us today, yet connecting with people you actually want to meet has never been harder.





We are here to make that happen. We are creating a new social networking experience that will let you connect with new people within your university and company networks. 
Moving to a new city for work? Trying to connect with alumni during your travels? Our mobile solution makes it easy and efficient to realize the full potential of your trusted networks.



It is currently very difficult to meet alumni from your past universities, as alumni networks exist mainly on web, resources are underutilized, and the websites are search-based. It's hard to find the right people, and even harder to start two-way communication.




On the other hand, the need to meet new people you trust is growing rapidly, with businesses being more global than ever, and thus employees being increasingly mobile and travelling to new cities frequently, in which they don’t know people. Therefore, alumni are trying to hack the problem by using Facebook and Linkedin groups or email lists. These solutions, however, are not leading to meaningful one-on-one connections. In groups and email lists, people do not feel that they are being personally contacted and have no obligation or pressure to respond.









A mobile and easy-to-use interface in which users can identify connections that belong to the same academic or professional groups and have thus been pre-screened, hence seen as a trusted reference. Stellup offers this experience.








1. Mobile App - easy to use
2. One-touch connect with your FB Account

We have already raised close to SGD $33,085, and now need to source for the remaining amount of SGD $53,715 to buy the van. Purchasing vehicles is an expensive affair in Singapore even for charity organizations! If we do not reach our target of SGD $53,715, then whatever sums collected will be set aside and we will continue with other fundraising efforts till we reach the target.    The Impact We have been doing this charity effort and do not wish to disappoint our elderly who depend on us:  Food for Life Program is important to us as we able to prevent hunger, allow our elderly to live in dignity and be compasionate to our fellow human beings. We have been successfully delivering for the last 7 years and hold an annual carnival and host close to 800 elderly members of the community, giving them an opportunity to step outside their homes and mingle with supporters, donors, well-wishers and members of the community. We do not discrimminate and reach out to everyone regardless of race, creed, language or religion.    Time is running out!  We need funds urgently as the deadline to purchase a van is a month away. So,   please donate generously! help us to help our pioneer generation who have done their part for the country    Other Ways You Can Help If you are not able to help us financially, please help to create awareness about our campaign among your family members, relatives and friends by:  sharing our campaign through social media, share our link. make alot of noise about our campaign   Please help, every dollar counts!",1.0,0,"4 Campaigns

Sugar is making us sick.

There's significant evidence linking our overconsumption of sugar to many of the major diseases plaguing our world today, including obesity and all the diseases of metabolic syndrome.


In 2014, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these, over 600 million were obese.
47 million Americans currently have metabolic syndrome.
Combined with less physical activity, processed foods full of high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt, micronutrient-poor foods are major contributors. 



The great news? These diseases are preventable.





By reducing our daily sugar intake, we can take the first steps toward a happy, healthier life.




Are you a SUGAR-HOLIC? 

You're probably right. Sugar is addictive. And we're eating too much of it.

Developed by a certified holistic nutritionist, the Sugar Stopper is an all-natural herbal supplement spray.

I live in Guam.  Our neighbors to the south, Ulithi and Fais (outer islands of Yap State, FSM), got schwacked this week by Super-Typhoon Maysak.  By the time the typhoon reached this tiny atoll in the middle of the Pacific the sustained winds were 160mph.  It ripped apart buildings and ruined crops.  I'm going to sail down to Ulithi and take a bunch of tarps and roofing nails and hammers to try to help start putting things back together.  I don't have a job right now so I have time to help out.  I'm hoping you will pitch in some cash to help me buy as many tarps and tools as I can stuff in the boat.  Thanks.<br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I'm hoping to get as much money as we can in a few days and take as much stuff as we can get.  If you send money it will be spent directly on supplies for the recovery.  If we don't reach our goal, we will spend what we've got and go with that.  Here are the things that people need right now:</p> <ul>

  What We Need & What You Get I'm hoping to get as much money as we can in a few days and take as much stuff as we can get.  If you send money it will be spent directly on supplies for the recovery.  If we don't reach our goal, we will spend what we've got and go with that.  Here are the things that people need right now: 

Food
Water
Clothes
Footwear
First Aid Kits
Personal Hygiene products
Building Tools and Supplies
Sunglasses
Hats
Chainsaws and Blades

Mosquito Repellent
Tarps/Tents
Water Filters
Batteries
Flashlights/Lanterns
Plumbing fitting
Stomach flu/Diarrhea Medicine
Fiberglass mat/resin and hardner
hand tools



   The Impact I can take a lot of diarrhea medicine and tarps and flashlights and hammers on my small boat.  There are people on the island right now waiting to use the few tools they have.  If we can take some tools down, they will be able to utilize the manpower they already have available and speed up the long recovery process.  People are in need of help and I am in a position to help them.  I hope you see that you are in a position to help them too and decide to donate.
You'll be able to follow the expedition on my website: www.pyrate-enterprises.com    Risks & Challenges  There is risk involved with sailing on the open ocean but this is the best time of year to make this voyage and I have gone this way before.  I am confident in my abilities and the sea worthiness of my boat Absolute to make the voyage with no problem.
  Other Ways You Can HelpWhether or not you can help out with money, please send some positive energy out into the universe on behalf of the people of Ulithi and Fais as well as Yap and Chuuk If you are on Guam and want to donate stuff instead of money we need hand tools like hammers and machettes and tin snips.  I can take some clothes and stuff too but if you have stuff in the next couple days, take it to the Julale Center to load it in the container until 8 April. I only have so much room on the boat.Please send this to other people so maybe they can help out too.  Thanks!!Pete",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Shabana, also known as Seri and this is our story. </p>
<p>I used to live the Corporate Dream with a big salary and elevated social
status but after almost 11 years working in the field of Public Relations, I
decided to quit my job and change my life’s path. </p>
<p>I did this because I realised that I was neither
pursuing my passion, nor was I growing as an individual or contributing beyond
myself in a meaningful way.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462348881/12523888_10103813118252468_3584754407571175987_n_eklhj4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>My ‘Eat-Pray-Play-Love’ journey to Siem Reap, Cambodia <br/>
<br/>
<p>I knew I had more in me because I wanted to do more and contribute to
mankind in a meaningful way and this clarity was crystal clear to me when I was on an
‘Eat-Pray-Play-Love’ journey to Siem Reap, Cambodia after quitting my job in 2015.<span>  During this journey, I volunteered at a local
NGO and chanced upon the idea of being a social entrepreneur.</span></p>
<p>Together
with my best friend – who’s been in the F&amp;B business for many moons, the
idea of the first Malaysian Café in Siem Reap, Cambodia was conceived.<span>  Since we both love Malaysian foods, we have
decided to showcase the many flavours of Malaysia to the communities and
travelers of Siem Reap.</span></p>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462348247/13150101_10154050432791271_1934050223_n_pbzhdq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>It is during my volunteering days, I was inspired to do more here in Cambodia <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462427919/13115653_10154052365411271_609138868_n_jzl4zb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Great friendships forged with local and international NGOs<br/><br/>

<p>Having a great time with my Cambodian family over a
delicious vegetarian meal</p><br/>The name ‘Serilahh’
which is from the word ‘Seri’ came about when we had a brainstorming session
with our friends who lived around the globe. During the chat, the group was
inspired to take on my nickname, ‘Seri’.<br/><br/><p>‘Seri’
simply means beautiful or beautiful and happy thoughts in the Malay language.
While lahh is a slang used by Malaysians, in which the particle ‘lah’ is used
at the end of a sentence to convey light-heartedness, politeness and a flexible
effect.<br/></p><p>Today, I live by the mantra, 'if it truly changed
your life, how could you not tell people about it and pay it forward?' Rather
than being <span>caught
up in the rat race in the struggle for wealth or power, I’ve decided to focus
on my real priorities: health, relationships, passion, growth, and social
service. </span> </p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Our campaign </b></h2>
<p>We
hope to raise $30,000 for the creation
of our café and to ensure that it is fully operational to our customers by June
2016. </p>
<p>The funds will also be used for
promotions: design; distribution; flyers; banners; hotel, high streets, <i>Tuk-Tuk</i>, airports and in-flight magazine
advertising. </p>
<p>As well as to
have the resources to train local Khemer cooks and service team to offer state
of the art Malaysian culinary and hospitality. </p>
<p>We
hope to create a
unique Destination Café by serving delicious, <i>halal,</i> Malaysian foods; delivering excellent customer service in a
cozy atmosphere and giving back to the local community.</p>

<h2><b>The Impact</b></h2>
<p>We hope that through <i>Serilahh Café</i> we’ll be able to
collaborate more with the local NGOs and make a difference in the lives of the Cambodian
people as well as cultivating entrepreneurship amongst young people through two projects<i> close to our hearts;
Mission Coffee</i> which is a microfinance programme that lends start-up capital
to families to run coffee cart businesses and to refurbish <i>Tuk-Tuks</i> in the <i>Kingdom of Wonder</i>
– Siem Reap, Cambodia.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <i>Mission Coffee</i> has a special place in my
heart since my volunteering days in Cambodia and it is my greatest wish to see
it through by continuing to champion the programme by securing funds through <i>Serilahh Café</i> to ensure the sustainability
of the programme. </p>
<p>We believe that through
<i>Serilahh Café</i> we’ll also be able to
connect, contribute and inspire the people of Cambodia.</p>

decided to quit my job and change my life’s path. 
I did this because I realised that I was neither
pursuing my passion, nor was I growing as an individual or contributing beyond
myself in a meaningful way.
My ‘Eat-Pray-Play-Love’ journey to Siem Reap, Cambodia 

I knew I had more in me because I wanted to do more and contribute to
mankind in a meaningful way and this clarity was crystal clear to me when I was on an
‘Eat-Pray-Play-Love’ journey to Siem Reap, Cambodia after quitting my job in 2015.  During this journey, I volunteered at a local
NGO and chanced upon the idea of being a social entrepreneur.
Together
with my best friend – who’s been in the F&B business for many moons, the
idea of the first Malaysian Café in Siem Reap, Cambodia was conceived.  Since we both love Malaysian foods, we have
decided to showcase the many flavours of Malaysia to the communities and
travelers of Siem Reap.
It is during my volunteering days, I was inspired to do more here in Cambodia Great friendships forged with local and international NGOs

Celebrating monthly birthday with colleagues

Having a great time with my Cambodian family over a
delicious vegetarian mealThe name ‘Serilahh’
which is from the word ‘Seri’ came about when we had a brainstorming session
with our friends who lived around the globe. During the chat, the group was
inspired to take on my nickname, ‘Seri’.‘Seri’
simply means beautiful or beautiful and happy thoughts in the Malay language.
While lahh is a slang used by Malaysians, in which the particle ‘lah’ is used
at the end of a sentence to convey light-heartedness, politeness and a flexible
effect.Today, I live by the mantra, 'if it truly changed
your life, how could you not tell people about it and pay it forward?' Rather
than being caught
up in the rat race in the struggle for wealth or power, I’ve decided to focus
on my real priorities: health, relationships, passion, growth, and social
service.  Our campaign 
We
hope to raise $30,000 for the creation
of our café and to ensure that it is fully operational to our customers by June
2016. 
The funds will also be used for
promotions: design; distribution; flyers; banners; hotel, high streets, Tuk-Tuk, airports and in-flight magazine
advertising. 
As well as to
have the resources to train local Khemer cooks and service team to offer state
of the art Malaysian culinary and hospitality. 
We
hope to create a
unique Destination Café by serving delicious, halal, Malaysian foods; delivering excellent customer service in a
cozy atmosphere and giving back to the local community.
Serilahh - A truly Malaysian Cafe Serilahh under construction
The Impact
We hope that through Serilahh Café we’ll be able to
collaborate more with the local NGOs and make a difference in the lives of the Cambodian
people as well as cultivating entrepreneurship amongst young people through two projects close to our hearts;
Mission Coffee which is a microfinance programme that lends start-up capital
to families to run coffee cart businesses and to refurbish Tuk-Tuks in the Kingdom of Wonder
– Siem Reap, Cambodia.
Furthermore, Mission Coffee has a special place in my
heart since my volunteering days in Cambodia and it is my greatest wish to see
it through by continuing to champion the programme by securing funds through Serilahh Café to ensure the sustainability
of the programme. 
We believe that through
Serilahh Café we’ll also be able to
connect, contribute and inspire the people of Cambodia.
Mission Coffee - Coffee for a Cause (Cold Brew & Nitro Coffee will be making waves in Siem Reap soon)  Refurbishment of Tuk-TuksUs best friends together with our dear Tuk Tuk friend; Phos
Risks &
Challenges
We basically foresee
two main challenges concerning the café but we hope to overcome them as this café
is something we really want to do and are committed to make it a success. 
They are:


Maintaining significant
customer volumes due to the high and low tourist seasons in Siem Reap. Thus we
hope to boost promotion amongst locals and expats living here

Sustaining service staffs with impeccable customer service by
providing ample service and culinary training and teaching of the English
language

family.

In the US, their futures are bright if they can, within their first 90 days, communicate in their new language, find a home and a job, and enroll their children in school -- a tall order.

Our Solution

Upohar makes these significant life transitions easier. By providing employment and paying a decent wage, we build the self-esteem and skill set of refugee women, while simultaneously putting them on a path to economic self-sufficiency. 

Training in the day-to-day operations of the business ensures that they will be employable even after they leave Upohar, creating lasting positive impact for our area. 

Cooking and serving their national cuisine for the public reinforces that their culture is valued and welcomed here, and affords our customers an enticing and vital lens into our employees' rich cultures of origin
Mentoring our talented employees, we work to ensure that they become self-reliant, productive citizens, who contribute to the economy; are a vital, integrated part of our community; and are supported through a challenging life stage.



Our Impact To Date
In the past three years, Upohar employees have successfully 
found permanent jobs in other organizations based on the professional 
experience gained at Upohar, and gained economic stability.

One woman worked at Upohar part-time while she attended school to

We intend to build on these successes and promote such outcomes for all of our employees. Here's how:

Add a food truck to our business, to simplify catering, participate at many more events, and significantly expand our visibility and outreach
Relocate downtown where foot traffic is greater, and extend our hours of operation
Create 7 additional full-time jobs as a result of the downtown location and the food truck
Implement these new jobs as paid apprenticeships to help 
people learn skills and gain professional experience, and become 
employable
Place “graduates” in permanent jobs elsewhere, and open up apprenticeship positions for new people on a regular basis





We have found a truck to buy. We have found a downtown location to lease. And we have found organizations that are interested in working with us to implement the apprenticeship program. Now we need funding!




The Budget

First Goal: $35,000 for the Food Truck
Here's a breakdown of how the money will be spent:
Used truck: $10,000
Equipment and supplies: $6,000
Labor to refurbish: $10,000
Permits, insurance, etc.: $5,000
Wrap: $4,000


Once we meet this initial goal, we can roll out the Upohar food truck and a new phase of our business. 



Additional Goals for Relocation


While the food truck makes its rounds, taking our global cuisine to you, we'll be working on building out our physical location. Here are the milestones:

If you can't contribute yourself, you can still help! 
We have created a special reward for the person who brings in the most contributions through their connections and campaigning efforts. The reward: an Upohar apron and a private cooking lesson. (We can do a lesson via skype if you're not local.)
So if you want to win this reward, be sure to create an IndieGoGo account and use their share tools.
Important Note
If you plan to contribute, please do so as soon as you can. 
IndieGoGo will give us the money as soon as we meet our first goal. So the sooner you give, the sooner we can get the food truck on the road! And the sooner we can move on to remodeling the restaurant and training apprentices to help them launch new careers.
In Conclusion

Thank you for reading this far. And thank you for your support to date. It is because of your belief in our mission, and your love of the food we serve, that we have been able to stay the course.
We hope you will consider investing in our future.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

Unlike typical wipes that leave a yucky taste and residue on your child’s lips, NeatCheeks are natural, sweetened, and flavored to give a more pleasant experience.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Are they sticky</strong>? No, NeatCheeks are sweetened and flavored with Stevia. Stevia is derived from a natural plant extract. Stevia is non-sticky, highly moisturizing, and has many health and skin benefits.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Are they natural</strong>? Yes, we only use high quality, natural ingredients.</p>

<p>The Ofyz business model is that of sourcing credit ratings from the investment community and having the community assess the quality of each rating through feedback scores.  Ratings are neither paid for by the credit taker nor the credit provider.</p>
<p>There are a number of flaws in the existing credit rating world that are addressed by Ofyz Ratings. Primary amongst these are:</p>
<p>-  conflict of interest: Existing credit rating agencies make their profit by charging the credit taker, the object of the risk analysis. This model is clearly biased;</p>
<p>-  failure of mathematical models: Existing agencies use mainly historical data. Ofyz seeks to use actual and forward looking data on top of historical data by integrating the outlooks from its raters and other financial professionals into the equation.</p>

What we needFor the site to be credible, it is is essential that the global business community is aware of and makes use of the site.  Ofyz needs sufficient funding to achieve critical mass by:- applying for certification in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on credit rating agencies (the Credit Rating Agencies Regulation);
- organising a seminar on open source credit ratings in the 'B. Amsterdam' start-up hub;

-  purchasing marketing software tools and undertaking growth hacking initiatives focused on specialists likely to be interested in helping to use and/or promote Ofyz.

The teamThe team, all of whom are providing their development and design services without charge, includes a manager at a major accountancy firm who deals with credit risk on a daily basis, an experienced director who provides consultancy and training on financial strategy and a senior functionary at the European Commission.

Risks and challenges

For Ofyz to be successful, it needs a critical mass of raters and ratings. The credibility of its ratings is dependent on there being a sufficient volume of participants. Increasing the awareness of the website is the goal of this funding request.
Protections are being built into the website to avoid the risk of abuse of the site by entities trying to affect their own rating.

    Other Ways You Can Help For this project to succeed, it is essential that the community becomes aware of its existence and contributes to the website's database.  Please help us by spreading the word to all your own contacts.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p>The Project Moken Team consists of a mix of Moken and people from a variety of different cultures. Read more about us here: <a href=""http://projectmoken.com/the-team"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://projectmoken.com/the-team</span></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">--------------------</p><p><br/></p>Some time after the Tsunami hit the Mergui Archipelago off the west
coast of Myanmar (Burma) and south Thailand, filmmaker Runar J. Wiik made an
astonishing discovery: The Moken Sea Nomads had kept their ancient secrets of
how to live an entire life on the ocean, a lifestyle believed to have vanished
in our modern times. But in the inaccessable islands of the Andaman sea, this
unique culture had survived. 

<p><span>Now, more than a
decade later, Runar has made several films with the Moken, started an organisation
(<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/project-moken-back-on-the-waves/www.projectmoken.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span></span></a><a href=""www.projectmoken.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Project Moken</a></span>) and found a way to help the
Moken get back out onto the waves (<a href=""http://www.projectmoken.com/project/project-m-a-p-moken-against-plastic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.projectmoken.com/project/project-m-a-p-moken-against-plastic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Project MAP</a>). Through Runar's work with the
Moken we can all benefit from the vast knowledge of the ocean and its
ecosystems embedded in the Moken culture for thousands of years. But this
winter something devastating happened; the key to Project Moken's past and future
success - the Vanya Catamaran, sunk during a Typhoon. </p>
<p><span>Having alreday
mortgaged his house to ensure Project Moken's future endeavors, the expense of
restoring the Vanya Catamaran on top of all the other activities to help make
sure we don't loose the Moken knowledge, may crumble next years efforts. And
the Moken, now forcefully stuck in slum villages both in Myanmar and Thailand,
will not be back on their beloved ocean. More elders will die before their
knowledge can be passed on to the younger generations. </span></p>
<p><span>By contributing to
make sure the Moken can get back on the waves, you will be part of a unique
project which uses ancient knowledge to save the coral reefs and marine
ecosystems in our modern times. Read more about one of Project Moken’s future
projects here:</span></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.projectmoken.com/project/project-m-a-p-moken-against-plastic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.projectmoken.com/project/project-m-a-p-moken-against-plastic/</span></a></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p><span>Project Moken has been
run and funded by Runar and his film projects about the Moken since 2006. First
we needed to make sure that the world knew that the Moken knowledge of living
on and in the ocean had not vanished with the rest of the crippled marine
nomadic cutures, and thanks to our films' numerous awards and special
screenings in everything from villages to royal quarters and the UN, to the web-based
outreach projects, - this goal has been achieved. </span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately
however, the living conditions of the Moken in the Mergui Archipelago has
only gotten worse. Without being able to live on their beloved waves, the
elders are dying and the future for the young seems hopeless. This is why Runar
wants, yet again, to aid the Moken in their wish to feed their children from
marine activities once again, and this he wants to do by enabling them to
take part in the much needed coral rejuvenation and plastic clean-up
initiatives. </span></p>
<p><span>Some of the most
remote islands on the planet - the Moken realm - is being destroyed by plastic
and un-ethical over-fishing with dynamite and poison. With Project
Moken's  Vanya Catamaran as the mother-ship of a small fleet of Moken
canoes, the eco-tourist initiatives in the areas will sponsor the Moken for the
first time, and ensure a sustainable lifestyle for them back on the waves. </span></p>
<p><span>But everything
stops without the Vanya Catamaran. Because of her unique re-design she is
currently the only boat the Moken can use for this purpose. The support you
give us now, will go directly to fixing the Vanya Catamaran. The work will be
done by Moken from Mu Koh Surin at the Chaipattana marine workshop in the
mangroves outside Kuraburi in the Phang Nga region on the border between
Myanmar and south Thailand, so all contributions will sustain Moken from day
one. And the Vanya Catamaran will become like their own traditional Kabang
boats before sailing out to launch the<a href=""http://www.projectmoken.com/project/project-m-a-p-moken-against-plastic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Project MAP</a><a href=""http://www.projectmoken.com/project/project-m-a-p-moken-against-plastic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a> initiatives.
We will proceed regardless of how much this campaign raises, but the process
will be prolonged until
we've gathered what is needed. The USD 42000,- will make the Vanya
Catamaran ready to sail. As shown in the making of film ""Kindred
Spirits"" and the film for this campaign, we have done this before, and can
calculate our costs very accurately.</span></p>
<p>Based on all the previous
work, and the nature of the fantastic Moken culture, we can offer some of the
best perks in return for your contribution. You get the films, credits on our
next film projects, unique Moken artisan work, training in Moken freediving
with a certified instructor, and you are invited to join us on a
voyage into the paradise island realm of the Moken. In addition, every
contributor has a shot at receiving the top perk of voyaging in the Mergui Archipelago
with the Moken, since at the end of the campaign we will randomly
pick a contributor regardless of the size of the contribution, to receive the
USD 5000,- perk!</p><p>To read more about our perks - please follow these links:</p><p>Moken Artisan perks: <a href=""http://www.projectmoken.com/?p=1871"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.projectmoken.com/?p=1871</a></p><p>Top Perks: <a href=""http://www.projectmoken.com/?p=1845"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.projectmoken.com/?p=1845</a></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>When Runar travelled back to<span> one of the off-limit military
controlled villages in the Mergui Archipelago last year, he wanted to say hello
to some of his friends from making the film ""No Word for Worry"" two
years prior. What he discovered was that since then, two of the people whom had
helped with the filming from the village had taken their own lives with
dynamite obtained from the fishing industry. Asking why, Runar was told that
they had seen no hope for the future. That is when he decided to help make sure
the Moken can back on the waves. </span></p>
<p><span>Most other
organisations involved with Moken focus on helping them with the challenges of
surviving the village life forced upon them by the modern world, but Runar
tries to create a way to feed their children and stay healthy by living on the
ocean again. The Moken need the ocean lifestyle to preserve their unique
knowledge of the sea, and this in turn is something we all need in the tasks
ahead of saving the oceans from ourselves. The Moken need the ocean lifestyle
to lead meaningful lives. Now their health, both physically and mentally, is
dwindling. </span></p>
<p><span>When the Vanya
Catamaran can bring the Moken back to their original realm, and <span><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/project-moken-back-on-the-waves/www.projectmoken.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""www.projectmoken.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Project Moken</a> </span>can continue working on an
international level, </span>the beginning of a sustainable future for the Moken,
our ocean, and ultimately ourselves, will be possible.<i>You

<br/></div>","Water4happiness es un movimiento que
nace con el objetivo de llevar acceso al agua potable a las personas que más lo
necesitan.
En México, más de 12 millones de personas no tienen acceso al agua
potable y las enfermedades gastrointestinales derivadas de beber agua
contaminada sigue siendo una de las principales causas de muerte en niños
menores de 5 años.
El acceso al AGUA POTABLE es esencial para llevar una vida digna y de
respeto a los derechos humanos.
Queremos que todas las personas en México y el mundo cuenten con los
servicios básicos de abasto, purificación y disposición de agua adecuados y
que al despreocuparse de cubrir estas necesidades básicas puedan desarrollar su
máximo potencial.
Agua de calidad significa Felicidad.
El movimiento water4happiness está creciendo, hemos visto que
cada día más y más personas como tú se  suman a dar solución a éste
problema.
Por esto creamos ""Happiness"", Agua de lluvia, alcalina,
antioxidante, libre de cloro, baja en sodio en una botella
oxobiodegradable. 
Cada vez que tomas ""Happiness"" estas ayudando a una comunidad
a tener acceso a agua limpia y segura, ya que 100% de la utilidad será
destinado a proyectos de abasto del líquido vital en las comunidades que más lo
necesitan, 
El movimiento water4happiness cree en la TRANSPARENCIA, por eso queremos que seas testigo de las acciones realizadas con los fondos recaudados de la venta de la botella de agua Happiness; cada botella tendrá un código QR que te permitirá conocer a las familias que estás beneficiando con el proyecto mensual.Para esto creamos una App que podrás descargar en tu celular, en donde podrás llevar un conteo de las botellas de happiness consumidas, compartirlo en tus redes sociales y ser testimonio del impacto en las comunidades atendidas,IMPACTOCon tu apoyo en esta preventa de ""Happiness"" lograremos hacer
más grande este movimiento y llegar a más personas que lo necesitan.
El dinero recaudado durante la preventa, será destinado a la
construcción de la embotelladora, dentro de las recompensas está la inclusión
de tu nombre en la placa conmemorativa del Recinto, boletos para la fiesta
water4happiness, producto gratis y regalos w4h.
Recibirás tus botella de Happiness, aún si no se logra la meta total.

<p>A
complete, user friendly and professional tool for loved ones to have access to
your care records - while still ensuring the highest security of your personal

<p>Your
well-being and safety remains important to those close to you. You want you to

understand that you need a caregiver that can ensure that you remain safe and
well taken care of.</p>

<p>We strive to have a
minimal number of caregivers assigned to each client. We work very hard to
avoid the revolving door of caregivers that is so common in home care. We are
instead creating a “team of caregivers” who are responsible for the care of one
client. We stay for at least 3 hours each visit.</p>

<p>Arisone Doc
allows for messages to be sent from loved ones directly to the caregivers and/
or manager. If you would like to get in touch with the manager, you have the
ability to send a message. The manager will be alerted on their smart phone
immediately, allowing for a prompt response.</p>
<p>The client’s
service plan is designed to ensure that both their needs and wants are met.
Each service plan can be customized to specify the procedure in which the task
is to be completed.</p>
<p>We view the
service plan as the “beating heart” of the care that we provide. We believe, in
order to create the best service plan, that both the client and their loved ones
should be involved.   If they are separated by distance, we also
offer case conference using a secure video chat. </p>
<p>Before an update
is made to the service plan loved ones will receive an alert on their smart
phone indicating a change is needed</p>

<p>You can assure
that the caregiver was at your loved one’s residence through our GPS tracking

will confirm that the caregiver was present.</p>

</div><br/></div>","We have developed Arisone Doc - the
future of Homecare


A
complete, user friendly and professional tool for loved ones to have access to
your care records - while still ensuring the highest security of your personal
information.
Your
well-being and safety remains important to those close to you. You want you to
be able to remain in your own home where you are comfortable. You also
understand that you need a caregiver that can ensure that you remain safe and
well taken care of.
You and
your relatives have high expectations for the company you choose to care for
you.  



 We want
to ensure that the caregivers are reliable, reputable, and attentive to your
wants and needs, and of course,


continuity
of the same caregiver. 


That
communication with the caregiver and the management team is exceptional, and
well informed with regular updates, 


assurance
that confidential information is kept secure at all times, and of course 


the
ability to be involved in the care.




Our
caregivers are trained by our knowledgeable and experienced management team.
All of our caregivers receive customized training determined by the specific
needs of the clients they are caring for. Our caregivers are also required to
participate in ongoing training to ensure their skills are kept up to date.
They are subject to criminal background checks
and drug screenings. We have a zero tolerance drug policy that includes
marijuana. 


l of our
caregiver’s wear uniforms and are provided with a care kit that include a
laptop, gloves, booties, a First aid kit, and a GPS Tracker.


Each
caregiver has their own Dockey – a thumb drive used to access Arisone Doc. Each
Dockey is imbedded with the caregiver’s identification to ensure that there is
no unauthorized access to Arisone Doc.
Family
members involved in the care of their loved one will also be offered a Dockey
that will allow them to access Arisone Doc from, any computer and follow the
daily notes entered by the caregiver.



We strive to have a
minimal number of caregivers assigned to each client. We work very hard to
avoid the revolving door of caregivers that is so common in home care. We are
instead creating a “team of caregivers” who are responsible for the care of one
client. We stay for at least 3 hours each visit.




Arisone Doc
allows for messages to be sent from loved ones directly to the caregivers and/
or manager. If you would like to get in touch with the manager, you have the
ability to send a message. The manager will be alerted on their smart phone
immediately, allowing for a prompt response.
The client’s
service plan is designed to ensure that both their needs and wants are met.
Each service plan can be customized to specify the procedure in which the task
is to be completed.
We view the
service plan as the “beating heart” of the care that we provide. We believe, in
order to create the best service plan, that both the client and their loved ones
should be involved.   If they are separated by distance, we also
offer case conference using a secure video chat. 
Before an update
is made to the service plan loved ones will receive an alert on their smart
phone indicating a change is needed





You can assure
that the caregiver was at your loved one’s residence through our GPS tracking
system, which is built into Arisone Doc. The GPS tracker is attached to the
care-kit. The GPS signal, in addition to the client’s signature in Arisone Doc
will confirm that the caregiver was present.



Arisone Doc is also
offering those involved in care of their loved one a platform of e-learning
covering different diseases, possible symptoms, as well as suggestions to
assist those involved cope with the physical and behavioural effects of the
disease.




Security and
confidentiality is our highest priority. Arisone Doc protects all information
against unauthorized access, offering complete confidence that personal
information is secure. Arisone Doc can only be accessed using the Dockey and a
personal password.  The security is similar to a debit or credit card.





Arisone
possesses the finest personal and technical security the world has to
offer.* 
 In
addition to our first-class security features, we have also built a revolutionary
architecture that allows you, as a customer, to choose who gets what
information. We grant you access to all of your documentation, and give you the
ability to grant access to those that you trust and wish to share this
information with. 
 You can
actively communicate with the care team and view up-to-date care notes and
notifications whenever it is convenient for you. We give you the control to
view and manage your documentation on your own computer. 



Architecture – An structure and flow that really
works. Based on professional experience and user feedback over more than 20
years. 


 Replication– Your information will always be safe in
several physical locations simultaneously. We do not rely on a single server to
store all of our customer’s information. 


Encryption – Our advanced level of encryption
makes it virtually impossible to illegally access your personal information.

</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b><span>2.<span> 
</span></span></b><b>Does this campaign
for profit?</b></p>
<p>No. This campaign is not for profit, and
organized by “Sustainable Nomads”, a nonprofit organization for supporting
nomadic families and nomadic culture.</p>
<p><b><span>3.<span> 
</span></span></b><b>How could it
be self-financing in the future? </b></p>
<p>After the
fundraising campaign on Indiegogo.com, potential nomadic families who lost
livestock in the “Dzud”, a severe winter in Mongolia, will be studied for
background check and will be provided with livestock (financed by the campaign)
for living. </p>
<p>Within our
fundraising target, 10 nomadic families, who lost everything in severe winter,
will be supplied with 100 sheep each (total 10 families*100 sheep=1000 sheep)
under the restart-up program, and another 10 families will be given 50 sheep
each (total 10 families*50 sheep=500 sheep). Livestock has average annual
growth rate of 50 to 95 percent rate. After a year, families got 100 sheep
under our support will give back 10 sheep and ones got 50 sheep will provide
back 5 sheep for next nomadic families in need. This way, payment in terms of
sheep will be collected to support other nomadic families each year increasing
the initial number of supported families from 20 to 46 in 10 years. <br/></p>
<p><span><b>4</b>.<span> 
</span></span><b>What are the
expected outcomes?</b></p>
<p>Considering
the livestock for food (nomadic families exchange livestock for other foods,
such as rice, floor etc.) and payment for next families, one nomadic family
started with 100 sheep has potential to increase them to 5294 in 10 years. <br/></p>

goat) in Mongolia, we will provide sheep through our aid program for the
following reasons, such as:


Sheep is the most endurant and has high survival rate after harsh
winter;

Grass and fodder required for sheep is less in size and affordable
for start-up herders;

Sheep is more affordable. So it enables buying more livestock for
more families given the limited fund to be raised; 

High livestock farming benefit;


2. 
Does this campaign
for profit?
No. This campaign is not for profit, and
organized by “Sustainable Nomads”, a nonprofit organization for supporting
nomadic families and nomadic culture.
3. 
How could it
be self-financing in the future? 
After the
fundraising campaign on Indiegogo.com, potential nomadic families who lost
livestock in the “Dzud”, a severe winter in Mongolia, will be studied for
background check and will be provided with livestock (financed by the campaign)
for living. 
Within our
fundraising target, 10 nomadic families, who lost everything in severe winter,
will be supplied with 100 sheep each (total 10 families*100 sheep=1000 sheep)
under the restart-up program, and another 10 families will be given 50 sheep
each (total 10 families*50 sheep=500 sheep). Livestock has average annual
growth rate of 50 to 95 percent rate. After a year, families got 100 sheep
under our support will give back 10 sheep and ones got 50 sheep will provide
back 5 sheep for next nomadic families in need. This way, payment in terms of
sheep will be collected to support other nomadic families each year increasing
the initial number of supported families from 20 to 46 in 10 years. 
4. 
What are the
expected outcomes?
Considering
the livestock for food (nomadic families exchange livestock for other foods,
such as rice, floor etc.) and payment for next families, one nomadic family
started with 100 sheep has potential to increase them to 5294 in 10 years. 







As we see
the graph above, we can find that how your contribution could build sustainable
nomadic life source. 1500 sheep will give 20 nomadic families sustainable lives
and 46 nomadic families in 10 years. The cycle could continue for long term
with self-financing and more and more nomadic families could get support in the
future. 
5.  How did you come up the “Restart up or recover program”?

We surveyed nomadic
families, and studied nomadic families, migration to cities, poverty among
migrant nomads, major reasons to migrate to cities, and the “Dzud.
What we
found led us to conclude that we are not only losing our nomadic life and
culture, but also having more and more problems of air & soil pollution,
unemployment, poverty, and shortage of energy supply and traffic congestion due
to the high migration flow to city. 
Our survey
conducted among nomadic families shows us what they need the most during and
after severe winter, and how much livestock do they need to restart or recover.

6.  How do you reach
nomadic families?
This year we focus
on the predefined provinces with high winter risk, such as Uvs, Arkhangai and
Dornogobi provinces.
             


                    Risk assessment of winter in Mongolia, as of November 2015
                                                         Center of Weather



Local authorities of the provinces have data base with
regard to nomadic families residing in the provinces and amount of livestock
they own. To select nomadic families, we will do in - person screening and
background checks together with local staffs.
7. 
Where do you ship?
We ship worldwide!
Shipping cost depending on your location will be added to perk price.
8.  How can I support
nomadic families?You can support us
by spreading the word! Sharing our campaign story on social media helps reach
more people and ultimately support more nomadic families in needs of help.",17.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p><b>SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>Passionate contributors,</p>
<p>My name is Milan Milenkovic. I am
from Belgrade Serbia, and I am in apartment rental business for
the last four years. For twenty years I worked as a DJ, so I do have a lot of experience in nightlife and I apply it
so that my guests get the best
conditions in night out in
Belgrade. My team and I are starting this campaign because we want to renovate the building where the apartments are located, and to raise
the service we provide to the next level.</p>
<p>My apartments are located in Savamala, the
old part of Belgrade and Belgrade’s hot spot, which dates back to the 19th century, to the period of
Austro-Hungarian rule, so the
building itself is the legacy and part of historical heritage. </p><p>Serbia has the rich historic
and cultural heritage because it
has been at the crossroads of East and West for
centuries. In the past decades our country was very badly presented
in  international media and
whoever was staying here could not believe
that he came with such prejudices. Given that
young people come to Belgrade primarily
because of the nightlife, we want to
show them real values not only of Belgrade but the whole state of Serbia. We wish to promote Serbia throughout,
gastronomy,
drinks, culture, historical sites, museums, excursions and night life.</p><p><a href=""http://www.bforbelgrade.rs/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bforbelgrade.rs/</a><br/></p>

First Parisian Bakery + Creperie + Coffeehouse
A Piece of Paris on Mainstreet USA Purcellville, Virginia: charming main-street town in the #2 wealthiest county in the United States {via Forbes}. Despite the epicurean population, the dining landscape is lacking in quality quick-service operations. Fine dining and mid-tier dining exist, but there currently does not exist a venue which provides an all-day epicurean experience; a comfortable, warm place to gather with friends, linger all day on a computer over coffee then lunch, a simple date night of chocolate and wine or a place to take kids for a storybook tea time.  Petit Lou-Lou will capitalize on the unrivaled performance of bakery cafés, the evident hole in the comp set and proficient hospitality talents of  tenured ownership to deliver a concept which will elevate the epicurean conversation in Loudoun County


  About Petit Loulou

A piece of Paris in Loudoun County, Virginia. 



Walking into
     Petit Lou-Lou is akin to stepping out of Loudoun County and into a corner
     cafe on the streets of Paris. The inviting, warm aromas of fresh chocolate
     croissants baking and freshly ground Counter Culture coffee greets
     guests all morning, an all-day menu of bubbling French onion soup, fresh
     baked quiche and crusty baguette sandwiches provide a comforting
     culinary experience and an evening program of Champagnes, wine + beer and
     cheese are an unmatched evening experience. The showpiece of the

<h1><b>160 Jahre Traube Bellenberg</b></h1>
<br/><p>Liebe Freunde, Traube Stammgäste, Traube Fans und Gönner !!</p>
<p>Ich fühle mich verpflichtet dieses beachtliche Jubiläum gebührend zu feiern. Seit Monaten plane ich alles und mir ist es gelungen die Gemeinde Bellenberg davon zu überzeugen, dass ich für meine Hirngespinste mehr Platz brauche und tatsächlich wurde die Sperrung der Bahnhofstraße genehmigt :-) Nun ist es amtlich:</p>
<p>Vom <b>13. - 15. August 2016</b> steigt der <b>160th Birthday Bash</b></p>
<p>3 Tage Jubiläum - 3 Tage Live-Musik - 3 Tage Unterhaltung. <br/></p>
<p>Ich will Vollgas geben! Wer mich kennt weiß, dass ich dazu neige ;-)<br/></p>
<p>Dies soll ein Event/Festival/Open Air/Straßenfest werden, welches das Illertal noch nie gesehen hat, mit 3 Bühnen (im Lokal, im Biergarten und im Zelt auf der Bahnhofstraße), nationalen und internationalen coolen Live-Acts und Rundumshaus-Bewirtung von morgens bis in die Nacht.<br/></p>
<p>Ein Fest für jedermann o h n e Eintritt!</p>_____________________________________________________________________________
<b>Warum diese Kampagne?</b><br/><br/>
<p>Weil des a Schweinemünz koscht!! Selbst wenn ich mit ""0815"" Bands fahre und den Ball generell flach halte, ist dieses Vorhaben mit dem Umsatz allein nicht zu stemmen. <br/></p>
<p>Und himmelherrgottsackradinommolabrauleggedmedochälleamarsch - 160 Jahre des isch doch ebbes. So was muß doch richtig gefeiert werden. <br/></p>
<p>Die Traube überlebte den 1.Weltkrieg, den 2. Weltkrieg und das Kneipensterben in den letzten 15 Jahren, hier bekam man die erste Coke, vielleicht war hier dr Benz persönlich mit dem ersten Automobil beim Einkehren, vielleicht hat der Einstein, als er seine Geburtsstadt Ulm besuchte, erst amol a Bierle in dr Traube gezwitschert und dabei die Relativitätstheorie ausgetüftelt, hier brannte wahrscheinlich schon eine der ersten Glühlampen, hier stand mit Sicherheit auch einer der ersten Fernsprechapparate und hier lief der Bolero noch von einem Phonopraphen :-)<br/></p>
<p> Und nun würde ich am Ende nur ein Pobelfescht auf die Beine stellen? Niemals!</p>
<p>Drum brauch i euch :-*<br/></p>
<p>Mit eurer Unterstützung entscheidet <b>ihr</b>, in welchem Umfang das ganze stattfinden soll. Sekt oder Selters? Wurschtwegga oder Spareribs? 3 Bands oder über 10? Das Programm steht bereits in meinem Kopf und will raus! Internationale Künstler warten auf meine Zusage und je nach Budget stelle ich euch eine Mega Band Line-up zusammen und diverse Showeinlagen. Da wird für jeden Geschmack etwas dabei sein und die Party wird unvergesslich. So wie es die Traube verdient.<br/></p>

<p>Just to make things clear, the staff at The Perfect Dump™ do not necessarily enjoy the frequent discussion of going to the bathroom. We don’t spend all our time online looking at pictures of poo or shopping for supplements or anything like that. But what we do enjoy is feeling our best. And there’s nothing that makes us feel better than taking a perfect dump in the morning, wiping once, and then going about our day.</p>
<p>That’s why we’ve adopted a completely no-nonsense approach to supplements and going to the bathroom by providing a straightforward, 100% all-natural, high-fiber powder with no chemicals added that is guaranteed to satisfy your needs or your money back does what it says it does. When the user mixes two scoops of our Perfect Dump™ supplement powder in with the beverage of their choice and they will experience the best dumps money can buy. Period.</p>
<p>The truth is most people don’t think about fiber supplements and taking the best dumps until it’s too late. They eat a bunch of crap for a few weeks in a row, managing out messy dumps that require tons of wipes. This can lead to dietary problems like constipation or diarrhea. To quickly resolve the issue, they run online and buy extreme supplements, laxatives or subscribe to colon cleanse powder diets. While these mixes and supplements might temporarily fix the problem, they often do so at the expense of the best day. Typical users can expect additional dietary issues like stomachaches and frequent visits to the bathroom.</p>
<p>The Perfect Dump doesn’t make the user go to the bathroom like a laxative, it makes it better <em>when </em>the user goes to the bathroom. The Perfect Dump’s unique blend prevents the need for extremes by regulating bowel movements before problems arise by filling out an inferior bowel movement with lubrication, texture, and substance.Even while binging on fast food it will compensate for the difference.</p>
<p>Everybody knows that everybody poos and that some poos are better than others. All someone has to do the next time they are online is click a few buttons and give it a try. After the user mixes two scoops of The Perfect Dump™ for two nights in a row, he or she experiences the best bowel movements the body can muster.</p>
<p>A note to users: while The Perfect Dump™ contains no known allergens or chemicals it should be still taken in moderation, specifically when a diet is lacking insoluble fiber. The Perfect Dump™ should be taken with at least 8oz of fluid and mixed thoroughly. First-time users should take The Perfect Dump™ for two nights in a row to experience the best results.</p>

<div>I am Kacie Smagacz.  I am passionate about my community in Charlotte and I am passionate about baking.  I believe that food is a powerful love language and I want to spread that love by networking with area nonprofits, organizations and individuals who also seek to see Charlotte, North Carolina thrive.  </div>
<div>I have been in the baking industry for almost ten years now, starting at a local cookie shop back home in Omaha, Nebraska.  I then entered the coffee industry and sparked my love for creating coffee and tea based beverages.  While I established my photography company in Omaha, I was given a job as a baker at a bakery downtown in the heart of Omaha's Old Market.  It was at this bakery that I started diving into recipes based off of dietary restrictions and preferences.  I found myself wanting to conquer every allergy that someone had and to make the little boy's dream of tasting a chocolate cake again come true, despite his allergy to soy, dairy, peanuts and corn--(not to mention his reactions once refined sugar entered his system!)  After that and falling in love with many people who are passionate vegans, I became invested in vegan baking.  I went on to work at another local coffee shop where I was surrounded by really amazing humans-many of whom are vegan.  I began to see even more clearly the need for healthy AND *delicious* vegan baked goods-therefore my menu is vegan-centric, but not strictly vegan.  I source as locally as possible.</div>
<div>I actively study nutrition and apply it to my life.  I want to be able to provide high quality baked goods in a nutritious way.  I want to be able to give people something they love, that won't deplete their body of nutrients at the same time. </div>

I AM BAKING UP A STORM and refining recipes for menu items, to provide consistency in quality.  I am meeting with fellow start-ups to gain insight through their experience.  I am meeting with organizers from nonprofits and groups who engage the Charlotte community for the better-through these meetings I am developing a forecasted schedule of the people I will be working with.   The idea is to pair monthly or as often as we can, to raise awareness for that specific cause or organization.  I aim to provide a specialty crafted baked good in that organization's honor throughout that month, proceeds from which will go directly to said organization.  It's kind of like Robin Hood but without actually stealing...and with a lot of really really good food.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

organisation who aims to help through humanitarian actions in the southern

to its geographical setting; rugged topography with limited flat land and
unreliable repeated shortage rainfall of 750 mm per year.</span><br/></p>
<p>An increasing population, low productivity of the land and less access to
safe water, sanitation facilities and hygiene practices are the main factors
that have been extensively aggravating food insecurity and poverty in the
area. Without queuing time of about 30 minutes, women spent 4 or 5 hours a
day on travelling to collect water from unprotected or unsafe sources. Donkeys
are even non-existent in this area and women carry as a result, water jerry can
on their shoulders. Access to sanitation facilities is very low and those
existing are poor in quality. Awareness of the community about sanitation is
very poor. Open defecation is common, people don’t practice hand washing and
washing faces is also not common in the villages. Washing the body and cleaning
clothes is usually considered as luxurious and not as health issue and this is
because of low awareness about hygiene. As a result, the prevalence of water,
sanitation and hygiene is related to diseases in the villages like diarrhoea,
trachoma, intestinal parasites, typhoid, typhus, and others. Therefore girls’
school attendance is very low because the parents need their labour to collect
water from distant areas.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p><h2>Tricycle Project</h2>The local non-profit organisation, Konso Development Association (KDA), has taken awareness of the problem through
a WaterAid Project being carried on, however the water scarcity will not
disappear in a close future. Our tricycles will have an immediate impact.
Collecting water commuting time will be shorten in addition to avoid
those women charging litters of water on their back.

<p>The project is supported and supervised by one of the most respected clan
chiefs in Konso, Sir kalla. Next to him, we will supply 100 cargo bikes to
those families in more need and in return, they will school young members in
the family and the bikes will be used for the good of the community. In
collaboration with the local non-profit organisations, Konso Development
Association (KDA) and Trees for the Future, a storage room is planned to be built
to stack local reserves for Konso’s own self-efficiency. It will be run by women
and our tricycles would be then one of their labouring tools. If row materials
surplus after harvest, they will be educated to an outside trading with the
neighbour provinces to boost the local per capita income.</p><p>  </p>
<h2>Possible Inconvenients</h2>
<p>We acknowledge the mountainous topography of Konso. Bike ridders will save anyway
a lot of time in the collecting water daily task. It is anyway easier to push
the bike with the water cans on up the hill than carrying them on their
shoulders. To avoid the improper use of the bikes, benefiting families will be committed
to school the young members in the family and to use the tricycle for the good
of their close community. We will employee those women in our community
activities where tricycles would be most useful. </p><p><br/></p>

<p><b>Welcome to my campaign!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2010 I rekindled my passion in collecting vinyl records, unfortunately I
found buying from charity shops and markets proved to be a waste of money as
they were badly scratched and un-playable. I was left in a dilemma should I
donate them to a charity shop and let someone else go through the same thing,
or take them to the local tip for land fill. </p>
<p>After some deliberation I decided to put them to use and started<b>
Livanupcycle </b>in 2012, making use of the great artwork found on album
covers. The first item I made was wall clocks from the covers, but still found
myself with the problem of having the vinyl to dispose of. Over the years I’ve managed to re-use all the bad
records purchased, the parts taken from old computers and even the odd tin can
into clocks, notebooks and jewellery. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435983968/xe2iwgaxobcv8k91ds4c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

starting I’ve mainly worked on the kitchen table and in the back yard, but now I
would like to increase the product range that I produce.  I have designs
for Perspex and Wood to take to the manufacturing stage but am limited with
working space. Starting this month (July) I’ve managed to secure a workshop for
the next year, but now need to purchase the correct tools to move forward.<br/><br/>I
have worked out exactly what equipment is needed to take my products to another
level. The amount I hope to raise through this campaign is £2,880.00. This will
go towards the following:<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435876477/hkhtqrue9e7j9ekhgm2j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>The major
item that will be purchased is a laser cutter, which allows me to broaden the
range of products using vinyl records along with Perspex and Wood, the second
highest spend is on marketing for the Christmas market, which has always been
my best sales period. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In
keeping with the nature of my business, stock purchases are waste or offcuts
from my local Perspex fabricator and timber yard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have
put together a list of very exciting perks for your contributions and hope this
will entice you to contribute towards making my expansion dream a reality.</p>
<p>My goal
of £2,800 is set at this amount, so that I can afford to buy all the equipment needed
to make an immediate start. I decided to use the flexible funding format to
allow for purchasing of equipment that will help towards moving forwards.</p>
<p>Of course, if all goes well and I end up
reaching, or exceeding my goal, I will buy in everything I need right away.
If I do exceed my goal, I will be able to start moving on to the other products that I plan to add in the future, sooner.</p>

<h3><b>The Idea</b></h3>The idea of producing smooking-wood came to my mind 2 months ago. I have a small coppiced-chestnut-wood, 3,2 acres (1,3 Hectares). There is a dense population of chestnuts stumps, and each one has dozens of trees of different age. Every ten years a coppiced-wood needs to be cut in order to start a new vegetative cycle. </div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435772582/deor4bmkcpa9qyx4356r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Motivations</b><br/>Usually 99% of this trees are turned into firewood or fence-posts. But I thought: ""There must been a more noble way to use this nice trees!"". So since I love smoking food with chestnut logs - and this kind of trees are totally missing in many areas of the world - I thought it could be a great idea making chestnuts-woodchips and sell them worldwide through the Internet.</p>
<p><b>Smoking Qualities</b><br/>Chestnut wood produces a medium weight nutty smoke, its coaling qualities are also medium. It gives the smoked meat very nice red colour and quite a unique characteristic taste. Use it to smoke fish, all meats, cheese and also vegetables. Can be successfully mixed with other woods.</p>

<br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The business is 100% eco-friendly and gives a second life to thousands of chestnuts trees, they have to be cut anyway because they grow in a coppice-forest. Moreover this business will have a positive impact on the surroundings and it will offer a new way to use this kind of wood.</p>
<p>For the smoking-food-lovers overseas this is a great chance to discover a new flavour. Chestnut wood can be succesfully mixed with other kind of wood and the possible combinations are huge. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The risk is almost close to ZERO, since I already own all the raw material I need. According to my calculation, with the current production I am able to sell 150-170 Tons of wood in the next three years. While I will be using the current biomass, a new vegetative growing cycle will bring new plants to maturation.</p>
<p>After 3 or 4 years I will probably need to buy a new piece of land. Chestnut forests are very common in my area and they are affordable.</p>

</div></div>","The IdeaThe idea of producing smooking-wood came to my mind 2 months ago. I have a small coppiced-chestnut-wood, 3,2 acres (1,3 Hectares). There is a dense population of chestnuts stumps, and each one has dozens of trees of different age. Every ten years a coppiced-wood needs to be cut in order to start a new vegetative cycle. 


MotivationsUsually 99% of this trees are turned into firewood or fence-posts. But I thought: ""There must been a more noble way to use this nice trees!"". So since I love smoking food with chestnut logs - and this kind of trees are totally missing in many areas of the world - I thought it could be a great idea making chestnuts-woodchips and sell them worldwide through the Internet.
Smoking QualitiesChestnut wood produces a medium weight nutty smoke, its coaling qualities are also medium. It gives the smoked meat very nice red colour and quite a unique characteristic taste. Use it to smoke fish, all meats, cheese and also vegetables. Can be successfully mixed with other woods.

   The Impact The business is 100% eco-friendly and gives a second life to thousands of chestnuts trees, they have to be cut anyway because they grow in a coppice-forest. Moreover this business will have a positive impact on the surroundings and it will offer a new way to use this kind of wood.
For the smoking-food-lovers overseas this is a great chance to discover a new flavour. Chestnut wood can be succesfully mixed with other kind of wood and the possible combinations are huge. 
    Risks & Challenges The risk is almost close to ZERO, since I already own all the raw material I need. According to my calculation, with the current production I am able to sell 150-170 Tons of wood in the next three years. While I will be using the current biomass, a new vegetative growing cycle will bring new plants to maturation.
After 3 or 4 years I will probably need to buy a new piece of land. Chestnut forests are very common in my area and they are affordable.

</div>","My Story



My name is Kevaughn Bonner. I was born in the community of Ritchies, Clarendon, Jamaica. The main source of income in my community is traditional farming. In my community, exists a situation where finding employment is sometimes an issue for both, young and middle aged members, as a result I thought of an idea that could help resolve this problem. My idea which can help with this situation is HydroFarmz, an idea I developed while studying at EARTH University, in Costa Rica. 



HydroFarmz is based on hydroponic production, where there exists the production of vegetables within an adjusted greenhouse environment. It's a great option for my community because a lot of land is not required for production in this system and training for community members is very practical.




What is Hydroponics?  Hydroponics is a technique used
to grow plants in water that is enriched with essential nutrients and there is
no use of soil in the growing process. Hydroponics: reduces water usage by 90%
in comparison to traditional agriculture, uses little or zero pesticides,  reduces the use of fertilizers and reduces energy
consumption. 
                                    
                                       (Hydroponics Nutrient Film Technique)
This initiative is of extreme importance because it will help me to fulfill my dreams of creating job opportunities and improving local and national agriculture.
The great minds that contribute to this initiative, will help to improve agricultural production in Jamaica and most importantly, improve employment rates within the community of Ritchies, Clarendon, Jamaica.

What We Need & What You Get




We hope to raise our target funding of $15000 through Indiegogo, which is required to initiate the construction phase and begin production.


The contributions will be used to purchase:

A pH meter
An electrical conductivity (EC) meter
A total dissolved solids (TDS) meter
A temperature meter
Construction materials
Net pots
Water pumps

Nutrients solutions for the system


All of the meters are required to ensure the production of high quality plants.

There are some interesting perks that you receive based on your contribution.


My favourite perk is the slogan competition, where contributors who donate $25 get a chance to create the winning slogan, which will become HydroFarmz official slogan.
Another nice perk is ""Get a growbed named after you"" - your name will be placed on the grow bed by using wood pyrography.

          
""Wood pyrography""

ALL contributors will have a dedicated page on the project's website (with their permission).


The Impact

Your contribution will certainly:



Help to make a positive change in the community of Ritchies, Jamaica.


Open employment opportunities for the youth of Ritchies.


Help to fulfil my dreams of seeing Jamaica improve agricultural
production.


Begin to change the negative thoughts towards agriculture in the minds of
Jamaican youth.




Risks & Challenges


 



The demand of quality product - This will be controlled with the integrated knowledge and experience gained at EARTH University.


The constant supply of product - This will be ensured with a planned scaled production schedule.


Pest Invasion  - The use of biological control methods, allelopathic plants and physical barriers  will permit a pesticide free vegetable production.

<p>Imagine an easy and efficient way to help those in your
community. Open Avenue is a new P2P (peer to peer) charity that allows you to send donations directly to individuals within your community through our online mobile-app or website. Donors can send gift cards in the form of groceries, clothing, books, coffee, or a night out to their recipients. Donors can also help pay for education, housing, or transportation costs. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why Open Avenue? </b>Sometimes it can feel like your charitable donations get lost in the system or become so diluted that they don’t really have an impact on those you are trying to help. Open Avenue lets you make a concentrated and direct donation to an individual so that you will see a noticeable change in their life.</p>
<p><b>With your
help Open Avenue can become a registered charity so that every donation you make will be eligible for tax credits. Check out some of our unique project perks and help open an avenue in your city today!</b></p>
<p><b>Our Team - </b>All successful projects start with a good idea and a great team. The Open Avenue Team is comprised of family and several close friends from university.

<p><b>How did it start?</b> One day while sitting on a 102 year old tree stump I came up with this simple philosophy.</p>
<p>Improve your life by improving the lives of others. </p>
<p>With this philosophy in mind, I successfully defended my
thesis, reduced to part-time hours at my job, lent out all of my belongings and moved to Europe with only a laptop and a suitcase to start a new philanthropic routine. </p>

It is surprising the freedom that comes with freelance part-time working hours.  I now get to work on my projects
that are important to me. For example, every month I travel to a new European city to set up a different altruism focused event. In addition to this, I have had time to develop Open Avenue, an idea that first came to me on ol' stumpy in Montreal a couple years ago. </div><div>

<p></p>My name is Michele Valleriani, I am 23 and I live in Amandola, Marche(Italy);
I organize and coordinate Basketball for Africa, an event that combines
basketball and charity. Every summer we organize a 4v4 basketball tournament,
with the aim to collect funds for the charitable association Sports Around the
World, established by the pro basketball coach Stefano Bizzozi. It aims at
building and managing basketball courts in several regions and Countries in
Africa, where life conditions are rather unstable. We support these guys by
giving them the chance to have fun and take their minds off daily routine; we
try to teach them basketball foundamentals, the virtues of sports in general
and, above all, we try to give them the chance to dream about a better future.
The fourth edition of this event will take place in Amandola, from the 27th of
july until the 7th of august. </span><br/>

Manuel Vanuzzo, Leonardo Ciribeni, Giuseppe Poeta, Sutor Montegranaro, Olimpia
Milano, Aurora Basket Jesi, Pallacanestro Varese, Pallacanestro Reggiana,
Dinamo Sassari and Los Angeles Lakers. Furthermore, in the previous editions, we
had the pleasure to host some important italian basketball personality such as:
Marco Calvani, Luigi Gresta, Cesare Pancotto, Matteo Boccolini, Flavio
Tranquillo, Fabrizio Della Fiori, Federico Gallinari e Giuseppe Cagnani. We are
concretely collaborating with these brands: “il Centimetro”, “Silverskin”

<b><h3></h3></b><p>Mi chiamo Michele Valleriani, ho 23 anni, vivo ad Amandola(FM) e sono uno degli organizzatori di Basketball for africa, manifestazione che coniuga pallacanestro e solidarietà. Organizziamo un torneo 4v4 con l’intento di raccogliere fondi per l’associazione Sports Around the World dell’allenatore professionista  Stefano Bizzozi, che si propone di costruire e gestire campi da pallacanestro in varie zone dell’Africa, dove le condizioni sono spesso precarie. Sosteniamo i ragazzi meno fortunati di noi per farli divertire imparando i fondamentali di questo meraviglioso sport, oltre che ad educarli ad essere una squadra, facendo loro coltivare il sogno di un futuro migliore.</p>
<p> La quarta edizione della manifestazione si svolgerà ad Amandola dal 27 Luglio al 4 Agosto 2015. Raccogliamo fondi per SATW tramite aste e lotterie nel periodo di svolgimento del torneo, oltre che attraverso le quote d’iscrizione e le donazioni di aziende, enti o privati. Ad oggi siamo riusciti a ricavare circa 4500€ devoluti interamente ed esclusivamente a SATW. </p>
<p>Dal 2012 Molti giocatori professionisti e squadre importanti si sono impegnati ad inviarci materiale tecnico da poter mettere in palio nel corso delle lotterie e aste che si concretizzano giornalmente nel periodo di svolgimento della manifestazione. Durante il triennio di attività hanno collaborato con noi, sposando e credendo fermamente nel progetto: Gallo fan club, Pietro Aradori, Luca Vitali, Gek Galanda, Marco Cusin, Matteo Imbrò, Diego Monaldi, Manuel Vanuzzo, Leonardo Ciribeni, Giuseppe Poeta, Sutor Montegranaro, Olimpia Milano, Aurora Basket Jesi, Pallacanestro Varese, Pallacanestro Reggiana, Dinamo Sassari e addirittura i Los Angeles Lakers. Inoltre nelle edizioni precedenti sono stati nostri graditissimi ospiti Marco Calvani, Luigi Gresta, Cesare Pancotto, Matteo Boccolini, Flavio Tranquillo, Fabrizio Della Fiori, Federico Gallinari e Giuseppe Cagnani, presidente del Gallo fan club. Concrete sono state le collaborazioni con marchi come “il Centimetro”, “Silverskin” “Quota CS Sport”, “Alpitour” e “Champion”.

Africa, where life conditions are rather unstable. We support these guys by
giving them the chance to have fun and take their minds off daily routine; we
try to teach them basketball foundamentals, the virtues of sports in general
and, above all, we try to give them the chance to dream about a better future.
The fourth edition of this event will take place in Amandola, from the 27th of
july until the 7th of august. 

We need money(2000 €) for the tournment in Italy and for build and manage other courts in Africa.
We can send our t-shirt to the person that helps us.

Mi chiamo Michele Valleriani, ho 23 anni, vivo ad Amandola(FM) e sono uno degli organizzatori di Basketball for africa, manifestazione che coniuga pallacanestro e solidarietà. Organizziamo un torneo 4v4 con l’intento di raccogliere fondi per l’associazione Sports Around the World dell’allenatore professionista  Stefano Bizzozi, che si propone di costruire e gestire campi da pallacanestro in varie zone dell’Africa, dove le condizioni sono spesso precarie. Sosteniamo i ragazzi meno fortunati di noi per farli divertire imparando i fondamentali di questo meraviglioso sport, oltre che ad educarli ad essere una squadra, facendo loro coltivare il sogno di un futuro migliore.
 La quarta edizione della manifestazione si svolgerà ad Amandola dal 27 Luglio al 4 Agosto 2015. Raccogliamo fondi per SATW tramite aste e lotterie nel periodo di svolgimento del torneo, oltre che attraverso le quote d’iscrizione e le donazioni di aziende, enti o privati. Ad oggi siamo riusciti a ricavare circa 4500€ devoluti interamente ed esclusivamente a SATW. 
Dal 2012 Molti giocatori professionisti e squadre importanti si sono impegnati ad inviarci materiale tecnico da poter mettere in palio nel corso delle lotterie e aste che si concretizzano giornalmente nel periodo di svolgimento della manifestazione. Durante il triennio di attività hanno collaborato con noi, sposando e credendo fermamente nel progetto: Gallo fan club, Pietro Aradori, Luca Vitali, Gek Galanda, Marco Cusin, Matteo Imbrò, Diego Monaldi, Manuel Vanuzzo, Leonardo Ciribeni, Giuseppe Poeta, Sutor Montegranaro, Olimpia Milano, Aurora Basket Jesi, Pallacanestro Varese, Pallacanestro Reggiana, Dinamo Sassari e addirittura i Los Angeles Lakers.

<div>Our town was once a hub of agriculture and commerce for the entire county. The railroad connected Thorndike to Maine cities and towns hundreds of miles away. When the last Farwell brother died in 1961 with no heirs, the store closed its doors and the domino-effect took place.  The railroad stopped running, the department store, car dealerships, cheese factory, woodworking shop, lumber mill closed; local artisans no longer had markets for their goods.  Today, we have empty storefronts and a populace that struggles with employment and even literacy.</div>
<div>After resurrecting the buildings, we will open as Farwell's Museum &amp; Store, with workspaces and studios for people to learn skills and produce goods for sale in-house and to the bustling coast, only 20 miles to the east. Collaborating with us, the railroad has plans to re-emerge as a tourist train to bring coastal visitors to our door. The Thorndike train to Common Ground Country Fair, which attracts over 50,000 visitors annually, boards at our doorstep.</div>
<div>Classes and studios will help develop expertise in the fields of literacy, woodworking, sewing, weaving, basketry, boat building, printing, bookbinding, metal smithing, shingle milling, box building, instrument-making, cooking, and sensible eating.  Our open spaces will host community activities such as senior exercise, dancing, storytelling, and concerts.</div>
<div>Local interest brings us willing volunteers, and much material has been donated.  We seek $200,000 to complete mortgage payments, professionally rebuild the foundations of the Mill and Store, create handicap-access to performance spaces, and to begin to stock our general store with ""Products for a Healthy Homestead.""</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Most of our group has lived in Maine for over 40 years and watched the demise of small-town economies as the coastal areas fill up with second-and-third homes for summer visitors and shops full of non-essentials. Meanwhile, all our taxes continue to rise.  Rural residents turn to public assistance and have few options for local employment or education in a skill.  </p>
<p>Among us, we have a letterpress printer; retired teachers in the fields of math, arts, woodworking and mechanics; a chef who specializes in nutrition of local and wild foods; a wooden boat builder; a furniture-maker; literacy volunteers; an artist/restorer of precious artifacts; an economist.  In addition, our studios-to-be are already sought by other local artisans.</p>
<ul> <li>Goal #1 - to clean all the buildings and find the treasures.  Museum creates itself as we discover articles of historic interest.  This is almost done.</li>
<li>Goal #2 - to catalogue the collection of over 4,000 old books (purchased by us separately); to establish their values; to create a reading room/ library of rare books, Maine authors and manuals of historic hand skills. This is almost done.</li> <li>Goal #3 - to finish paying our mortgage ($45,000+) and secure ownership of the buildings.</li>
<li>Goal #4 - to straighten the sunken buildings, construct new foundation and sills as needed; to make the buildings accessible to the public. Mill building has already been righted and repaired, thanks to dedicated volunteers.</li>
<li>Goal #4 - to create year-round artisanal studios on 2nd floors; to create an inviting private studio for visiting resident artists and craftspeople.</li>
<li>Goal #5 - to invite local people as interns and apprentices to these skills.</li>

from now being ushered into a new gourmet restaurant — Galerie 23. As you enter, the decor, the music, the aromas beckon
you to a fine dining experience.  As the host seats you, your mouth waters

Water is polluted with contaminants, such as heavy metals and chemicals of all kinds, that are very hard to get rid of and ultimately integrate the food chain. The same can be said about the way we produce our energy, resorting vastly to nuclear energy is nonsensical. 

At the same time, we waste an awful lot of said energy that has been generated at high cost, and that could be salvaged . provided we have means to store it...

That is indeed the whole problem with electricity, it is very hard to store efficiently so we always generate more than we actually need and the surplus is wasted as it goes back to ground.

<br/><br/>We have devised what could be the blueprint for a self-sustained small community that addresses the problems of water purification and energy storage in an innovative and holistic way that is SUSTAINABLE.

This blueprint rest on technology that is already existing but had never been put to work in such a way. No miracle here, just  common sense and little technical know how.

<br/><br/>In our model, electricity generation could be a mix of water / wind / solar generation units depending on what the close environment could better provide. The electricity generation would be coupled to low cost electrolysis facilities that actually split water into its base constituents : oxygen and hydrogen when there is over capacity in electricity generation compared to the demands of the network. With a flip switch electricity instead of being routed to ground and be wasted electricity would be sent to the electrolysis plant, wich consist merely of water reservoirs with anodes on one side and cathodes on the other. No costly apparatus there.

That in turn is an effective way to store the overproduced electricity into something that could eventually serve as an energy source for other purposes when needed as hydrogen is a pollution free energy source that could be used to drive turbines and generate more electricity when needed, when there is not enough wind for example or could be used to heat the buildings on a hot water system.

When Hydrogen burns, it recombines and produces PURE water. Thus, splitting water and burning subsequently the hydrogen generated has this advantage of making water purification process part of the equation.

<br/><br/>You don't have to take clean drinking water for splitting purposes, you can take the most contaminated water there is and the contaminants would separate from water and remain in the bottom of the bucket used for electrolyte, better than any other process of purification you would end up with 100 percent pure water with no chemicals or heavy metals that could have made its way to contaminate the water <br/><br/>Using a process such as distillation for example, mercury or any contaminant with a very low boiling point, would most likely turn into vapor and be still present in water should distillation be used.  Likewise, filtration always will let a part of the contaminants slip through. This has no chance to happen with our technology as water is splitted to its basic constituents and then generated as PURE WATER as part of the process of burning hydrogen. No need to add even more chemicals to make it safe to drink either. No rocket science here.<br/><br/>And we do not even have to generate actual electricity to fuel the electrolysis process, we have floating in the air an enormous amount of energy currently generated for other purposes be it radio waves, static electricity, that also go to waste and that also could be salvaged and stored in gas form by splitting water with it. It can be easily harvested with a simple system of copper coil such  devised by a 13 years old kid for $15 lately... <br/>see : <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPhRq5r8iqg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPhRq5r8iqg</a>
<br/><br/>The purpose of this fund raising effort is to have the whole process patented wich has a cost and to put together a small scale operational real life community operating on such a technology as ""proof of concept"".

Depending upon the amount ultimately raised we could buy some land and make it the first village of its kind where no nukes are needed and everybody has fresh pure water to drink and bath in.

That sounds like a good start to me... What do you say neighbour? Can we do it toghether?  YES WE CAN make our world a better place....

<p>GRAND SPIRITS, based in the historic town of Grand
Valley, is realizing its long held ambition to create Ontario’s very first renewable,
community craft distillery. One hundred years since the beginning of
Prohibition in the Province, the Headwaters Region will see its first legal
stills come alive. A Community buy in will help to put distilling back
at the heart of the community that was once the hub of Agri-Tourism for the
region, long after other towns had gone “Dry”.</p>
<p>More than fifty percent of the
distillery’s investment will be reserved for this purpose. The remaining
investment will be available to social investors throughout Canada and beyond. This
will ensure a high level of local ownership of the distillery, but include
online opportunities here on INDIEGOGO rising in increments from as little as $40 CDN up to $2,500
CDN. Significant rewards are being extended to FIRST FOUNDERS as part of the
campaign (see Perks). The first phase of the campaign kicked- off this summer, before the 149<sup>th</sup> birthday of the nation, and the official ribbon
cutting ceremony of the new distillery will take place at 5PM EST on July 1<sup>st</sup>,
2017 with cocktails - for Happy Hour.</p>
<p>Whisky and Gin have been made in Grand Valley
for more than a hundred years, thanks to pioneer immigrants from Ireland,
England and the Netherlands. The new Distillery will re-instate craft
distilling and serve as an engaging learning experience of the history, lore, traditional
methods and secrets used to make the legendary “<i>Grand Valley Gold</i>”, noted for exceptional smoothness and unusually
fresh qualities, to the area.  In its
prime, the town boasted at least three service Tavern hotels, (<i>The Dominion, The Commercial and The Central</i>),
in an era when <i>all </i>the surrounding
communities and most of Ontario had been overrun by the scourge the Temperance
Movement.  It is safe to say that the
incorporation of Grand Valley, as independent from East Luther and Dufferin
County, was specifically over the freedom to enjoy beverage alcohol in the
town!  Elections were fought right
through the early days of the twentieth century on this issue, prior to the
Provincially-mandated Prohibition. Trainloads of tourists would come to the
small town to stock up and experience the uniquely crafted products of the
community, all made from local ingredients, before and during Prohibition.</p>
<p>The new GRAND SPIRITS Distillery will open its
doors on a landmark site in the town of Grand Valley – the old schoolhouse
built in 1893 that sits dramatically above Main Street.  It will use local ingredients from area
family-owned farms and will be powered by green, ultra-low carbon sources.  Grand Valley itself currently produces up to 60
Megawatts of clean electricity with its wind turbines, making it one of the
leading communities for renewable energy generation in the province. The
significant architecture of the distillery site, as well as its associated
museum displays and themed tasting room – coupled with this renewable energy
leadership – will help make GRAND SPIRITS a major visitor destination.  This will also contribute to the distillery
emerging as a unique player on the global stage, just as interest in craft
spirits is building to unprecedented levels in North American and worldwide.</p>
<p>Grand Valley is uniquely positioned, high in
the Headwaters Region, which itself attracted 875,000 visitors last year and
generated over $65,700,000 in spending. In 2013, even the smallest of Scottish
distilleries attracted an average of 25,000 visitors – including new builds on
remote islands. With only 15 micro distilleries open or coming online in
Ontario in 2016, and a rapidly improving legislative environment, the GRAND
SPIRITS Renewable Community Distillery will be vertically integrated to grow
with a demanding market for both unique travel experiences and locally-produced
artisanal products from natural and sustainable sources.</p>
<p>Spokesman for the distillery is retired executive,
mixologist and bootlegger, Jamie Stam, supported by a respected board of
directors and local farming community representatives. He is currently featured
in the “Faces of Headwaters” Marketing Campaign. Jamie said: “We have a truly
winning combination here of a stunning natural location on the Grand River, immense
historical appeal linking back to Prohibition and readily available local
harvest and ingredients, <i>plus</i> solar
and wind energy experience to bring this innovative distillery project to
fruition.”</p>
<p>“From the outset we have envisaged the project
as more than a distillery. It is an opportunity for all social investors to
help this historic town build on its agricultural heritage, its
community-ownership and its environmental credentials. We have amazing local
resources and recipes, and will be using ingredients from our region.”</p>
<p>Jamie added: “There is a real buzz around <i>small batch</i>, crafted spirits and on the
eve of our launch, we want to get the message out to the local community as
well as to Gin and Whisky lovers near and far to become a founder in the future
of the GRAND SPIRITS Renewable Community Distillery at the old schoolhouse.”</p>
<p>While major governmental hurdles remain, construction
of the distillery itself will be underway this Fall and is due to be
completed in early 2017. The
distillery will produce craft Gin and Whisky, as well as a traditional “School
Spirit” aqua vitae/white whisky/vodka for infusion and cocktails. The building will include an
associated Visitor Centre/Tasting Room and gallery, with a themed late Victorian/Industrial
décor, as part of a wider plan to position the area as Ontario’s premier rural

</div><br/></div>","GRAND SPIRITS, based in the historic town of Grand
Valley, is realizing its long held ambition to create Ontario’s very first renewable,
community craft distillery. One hundred years since the beginning of
Prohibition in the Province, the Headwaters Region will see its first legal
stills come alive. A Community buy in will help to put distilling back
at the heart of the community that was once the hub of Agri-Tourism for the
region, long after other towns had gone “Dry”.
More than fifty percent of the
distillery’s investment will be reserved for this purpose. The remaining
investment will be available to social investors throughout Canada and beyond. This
will ensure a high level of local ownership of the distillery, but include
online opportunities here on INDIEGOGO rising in increments from as little as $40 CDN up to $2,500
CDN. Significant rewards are being extended to FIRST FOUNDERS as part of the
campaign (see Perks). The first phase of the campaign kicked- off this summer, before the 149th birthday of the nation, and the official ribbon
cutting ceremony of the new distillery will take place at 5PM EST on July 1st,
2017 with cocktails - for Happy Hour.
Whisky and Gin have been made in Grand Valley

These activities put wine exploration directly into the hands of our guests, making them interactive and highly eclectic.

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>While every new business has costs associated with start up (and we are certainly no different) our greatest need is to fund and deliver our first few experiences. This approach will help us put together the long list of materials that we need to launch as well as give us ""dry runs"" on our new experiences with an audience that is interested in seeing this concept flourish. For this campaign, we are hoping to raise $5000 with much of this going directly into the perks that we will be offering. If we are fortunate enough to receive additional contributions, the monies will be spent in outreach to the market in the form of Ads to improve our search engine order as well as content-rich collateral and boosted social media campaigns.</div>
<div>We have a number of our activities that we are offering as perks for those who want to go big, but we want to start the fun with what everyone, no matter their level of contribution via The Launch Party! If you hit the $50 contribution level that will get you 2 tickets to our Launch Party. We will be conducting a few samples of our wine activities at that event so that you can get a first-hand look at what we do at Vine Graft. Beyond this, you can select a contribution level that gains you perks such as Building Your Own Flight, Mapping Your Palate, Meeting Your Palate, Top Pairing! or Paint and Palate experiences. Anyone who contributes, no matter the level, will receive a pair of tickets to our launch.</div>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>If you think about our name, Vine Graft, it makes so much sense in terms of what we do. We are connecting to people, places and wine all across the board. And what we have found is that there is a huge need for it. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our business was born out of a natural and logical fulfillment of that need.  </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Your contributions will help get a unique and innovative business launched. We envision a day where this approach could reach wine enthusiasts everywhere to create discovery and commerce.  </span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We did not simply wake up one day and say, ""Wow! Let's have a wine experiences business!"" What does that mean anyway? This decision revealed itself to us while working our tails off in the industry. We have seen what works, what doesn't work and what is missing. Vine Graft is the culmination of our experience and the collaboration between ourselves, our customers, our associates and people we have met in this business.  </span></div> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The good news here is that at this stage, we are not burdening this business with lots of cost. It won't take much to get us going. We don't need ""brick and mortar"" or a big investment in inventory, so at this early stage, the risk is minimal. Our challenge is in getting the Vine Graft concept out there -- to get ourselves off the ground and flying which is why this campaign is really geared toward delivering the perks. It's one way that we can begin. Writers have to pick up a pen, builders start with a shovel. We need to deliver our experiences to more people and let the buzz begin.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Wa<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">ys You Can Help</span>
</h3> <p>So if you aren't up for a wine experience at your company or at your next party, we understand. Please don't buy a perk and not use it! You can help us by spreading the word inside your organization or among friends where you believe there is a fit. Even if you don't think it's a fit, sometimes it doesn't hurt to mention, right?  </p>

At the end of the day, your palate is something you want to feel like you can both own and openly explore, and our activities help you get more in tune with that part of yourself while enabling you to learn about, and help, others with theirs. Given that Vine Graft's foundation is built upon the grafting of specific wine interests with needs to create a tailored experience, our personal goal is to work directly with our guests, guiding them to select the most exciting wine activities to suit their needs, while exposing them to lesser-known local and urban wineries. No matter the goal, be it building team connectivity or for personal enjoyment, we'll guide you towards the experience and wine that you feel will best fit the occasion, helping you to develop friends out of co-workers and family out of friends.
In the way that one vine is particularly grafted onto another in order to create something stronger and more integrated, the activities we offer at Vine Graft promise to bring guests together in a similar way, bridging and building connections while strengthening personal palates.

   What We Need & What You Get
While every new business has costs associated with start up (and we are certainly no different) our greatest need is to fund and deliver our first few experiences. This approach will help us put together the long list of materials that we need to launch as well as give us ""dry runs"" on our new experiences with an audience that is interested in seeing this concept flourish. For this campaign, we are hoping to raise $5000 with much of this going directly into the perks that we will be offering. If we are fortunate enough to receive additional contributions, the monies will be spent in outreach to the market in the form of Ads to improve our search engine order as well as content-rich collateral and boosted social media campaigns.
We have a number of our activities that we are offering as perks for those who want to go big, but we want to start the fun with what everyone, no matter their level of contribution via The Launch Party! If you hit the $50 contribution level that will get you 2 tickets to our Launch Party. We will be conducting a few samples of our wine activities at that event so that you can get a first-hand look at what we do at Vine Graft. Beyond this, you can select a contribution level that gains you perks such as Building Your Own Flight, Mapping Your Palate, Meeting Your Palate, Top Pairing! or Paint and Palate experiences. Anyone who contributes, no matter the level, will receive a pair of tickets to our launch.


   The Impact
If you think about our name, Vine Graft, it makes so much sense in terms of what we do. We are connecting to people, places and wine all across the board. And what we have found is that there is a huge need for it. Our business was born out of a natural and logical fulfillment of that need.  

Your contributions will help get a unique and innovative business launched. We envision a day where this approach could reach wine enthusiasts everywhere to create discovery and commerce.  
We did not simply wake up one day and say, ""Wow! Let's have a wine experiences business!"" What does that mean anyway? This decision revealed itself to us while working our tails off in the industry. We have seen what works, what doesn't work and what is missing. Vine Graft is the culmination of our experience and the collaboration between ourselves, our customers, our associates and people we have met in this business.     
Risks & Challenges The good news here is that at this stage, we are not burdening this business with lots of cost. It won't take much to get us going. We don't need ""brick and mortar"" or a big investment in inventory, so at this early stage, the risk is minimal. Our challenge is in getting the Vine Graft concept out there -- to get ourselves off the ground and flying which is why this campaign is really geared toward delivering the perks. It's one way that we can begin. Writers have to pick up a pen, builders start with a shovel. We need to deliver our experiences to more people and let the buzz begin.

    Other Ways You Can Help
 So if you aren't up for a wine experience at your company or at your next party, we understand. Please don't buy a perk and not use it! You can help us by spreading the word inside your organization or among friends where you believe there is a fit. Even if you don't think it's a fit, sometimes it doesn't hurt to mention, right?  
Thank you,
Karen and Dave

<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">On February 14, 2000 a tragic hit &amp; run car accident
took the life of Carolyn Moor’s husband, Chad Moor. In an instant the love of
her life and the father of her two- and four-year old daughters was gone
leaving her with nowhere to turn. Unexpectedly, Carolyn found herself mentoring
other widows which led to her appearance on TLC and The Oprah Winfrey Show in
2006. A multitude of widows feeling alone in the world contacted her and over
the past three years, opening her home, <a href=""https://www.modernwidowsclub.com/author/carolyn-moor/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Carolyn </a>has mentored more than 400
hundred widows successfully helping them discover purpose and meaning.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Thus started <u><a href=""https://modernwidowsclub.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Modern Widows Club</a></u> which became a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 2014
with 9 chapters throughout the U.S. and a long waiting list of those wanting to
start chapters in their hometowns. With its 30 day-to-day volunteers and nearly
20 dedicated professionals providing pro bono in-kind services to help launch
this new nonprofit organization that serves to empower widows, <a href=""https://modernwidowsclub.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Modern Widows Club </a>is poised to expand and reach thousands more widows.</span></p>

and lean into life with dignity and confidence to build personal resilience.

61, lost her husband to a sudden heart attack. Her children grown and living on
their own, she and her husband loved to travel. After her husband passed she
felt devastated and eventually lost her home. Searching online she found MWC on
Facebook and decided to travel to meet Carolyn in person. She sought advice and
guidance hoping to someday find the strength to move forward and give back too.
After 18 months of mentoring, Cindy launched her own MWC chapter and has
touched the lives of over 275 widows. 
Cindy’s life has been touched also. After 3 1/2 years of feeling lost,
but still full of hope and joy, Cindy remarried and honeymooned in Europe. Cindy’s new husband,
Robert, is grateful for MWC, which contributed to her increased faith and joy to continue choosing life as a catalyst which shaped the woman he fell in love with and supports
her in her service to widows.</span></span>

</div></div>","Summary





On February 14, 2000 a tragic hit & run car accident
took the life of Carolyn Moor’s husband, Chad Moor. In an instant the love of
her life and the father of her two- and four-year old daughters was gone
leaving her with nowhere to turn. Unexpectedly, Carolyn found herself mentoring
other widows which led to her appearance on TLC and The Oprah Winfrey Show in
2006. A multitude of widows feeling alone in the world contacted her and over
the past three years, opening her home, Carolyn has mentored more than 400
hundred widows successfully helping them discover purpose and meaning.
Thus started Modern Widows Club which became a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 2014
with 9 chapters throughout the U.S. and a long waiting list of those wanting to
start chapters in their hometowns. With its 30 day-to-day volunteers and nearly
20 dedicated professionals providing pro bono in-kind services to help launch
this new nonprofit organization that serves to empower widows, Modern Widows Club is poised to expand and reach thousands more widows.

The
Mentoring Model
Widows feel alone. While grief counseling, support groups,
etc. may help get through the initial trauma, they are temporary. Modern Widows Club’s mentoring model is designed to help widows regain a sense of self
and lean into life with dignity and confidence to build personal resilience.
Using the mentoring model MWC has successfully helped over 3,000 of
its members to get back in step with life to the point where they are
giving back to others. Thus, our slogan Move Forward While Reaching
Back.


Needs and
Impact


1. Ensure ongoing services 


 More than 15,000 widows are served on a daily basis via
Modern Widows Club chapters and  local
and online communities. For example, each month an average of 50
new widows attend socials led by MWC leadership teams at the 9
existing chapters throughout the United States. 

2. Launch more local chapters
and reduce wait lists



Over the past year a list has been accrued of more than
75 widows who meet MWC’s leadership requirements and have
been waiting to start chapters and begin mentoring widows in their
hometowns.

As a start-up nonprofit, based on our strategic planning and
proposed budget approved by our  Board of Directors, this campaign’s
$100,000 will significantly assist Modern Widows Club in areas such as building
a needed infrastructure and legal counsel, creating a chapter leader
training toolkit and conferences, chapter growth and travel, technical support,
and  volunteer year-end appreciation events.
Over 85% of funds go toward our community programs and
services. Please, visit our Guidestar page for more information
and Great Nonprofits for community reviews showing how we make a
difference.



We invite you to play a role in touching the lives of those
who feel undervalued and forgotten. Your contribution, regardless of size, will have a direct
impact in helping Modern Widows Club to continue, and expand, its proven approach helping widows
get back in step with life and give back to others. Thank you for your support!

Sample Success Stories


   (Names
are real with expressed permission)




Cindy,
61, lost her husband to a sudden heart attack. Her children grown and living on
their own, she and her husband loved to travel. After her husband passed she
felt devastated and eventually lost her home. Searching online she found MWC on
Facebook and decided to travel to meet Carolyn in person. She sought advice and
guidance hoping to someday find the strength to move forward and give back too.
After 18 months of mentoring, Cindy launched her own MWC chapter and has
touched the lives of over 275 widows. 
Cindy’s life has been touched also. After 3 1/2 years of feeling lost,
but still full of hope and joy, Cindy remarried and honeymooned in Europe. Cindy’s new husband,
Robert, is grateful for MWC, which contributed to her increased faith and joy to continue choosing life as a catalyst which shaped the woman he fell in love with and supports
her in her service to widows.






Vickie,
59, a florist and her grown daughter, Yvonne, 32, became widows within 18 hours
of each other. Vickie’s husband passed in his sleep on vacation and Yvonne’s
husband sadly took his own life. Yvonne needed Vickie in her deep grief yet
Vickie needed others to help her pick up the pieces. MWC gave Vickie the
community and role models she was seeking. With her new found strength she uses
her experience as a florist to give back joy on a daily basis. At the Orlando
chapter, thanks to Vickie, every woman leaves an MWC social with one of her
flowers and she has even provided flowers for other members’ events and weddings. 






Karen,
29, and mother of a 2 year old boy, found herself widowed when her husband was
murdered. (His killer has not been found.) Due to mounting stress and loss of numerous sources of support, like many widows, eventually Karen lost her job. Overwhelmed with the extreme pressures of

<p>*<strong>Short Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>Allison owned the premier women's fitness/pole dancing studio in Boise, Idaho for several years before we united and began traveling the world in what can be called a spiritual journey. She built her business from the ground up and left it thriving in the hands of former customers-turned-teachers/owners. It was too much a commodity for the community to not continue the business.</p>
<p>Wind had completed massage therapy schooling between Boise, ID, and Sedona, AZ in 2012, in addition to his Reiki education and other Complementary and Alternative Therapies. He set out to the Amazon at the end of 2012 to dive into shamanism, mysticism, and heart-based consciousness. His background of 20 years Navy concluded with a Graduate-level Certificate in Social Entrepreneurship and Non-Profit Management at the University of Minnesota's prestigious Humphrey School of Public Affairs. In 2016 he added Tantric Yoga Teacher Training (RYT 200) to his toolbox. </p>
<p>Together Wind and Allison have amassed thousands of miles of global travels in the 4 years we've been together, all being a deeply insightful inner journey. The knowledge has always been that in the right timing, we would open our own center to begin giving back to our community the knowledge of self-journey that we've amassed along our cumulative life experiences. And we've learned a lot.</p>
<p>We have a long-standing webpage for our services which saw a <i>300% increase in business </i>beginning August of 2016. With our recent work at a local healing center, we were given the final tools and boost to recognize that what we have learned has high value in Santa Fe and to the global traveling community.  </p>
<p><strong>*Short term (next 12 months) and long term objectives</strong>:</p>
<p>We are going to start immediately with Aerial Silk Yoga, mat yoga, and Energy/Reiki/Massage services. Aerial Silk and even Pole dance have been highly requested from a vast amount of various local population seeking to enhance their movement and empowerment in ways that don't yet exist in the Santa Fe market.</p>
<p><i>*As July is said to be of the busiest times in Santa Fe, and the location for our business is prime in the downtown area, we expect that even this modest start will hit a huge success immediately. </i></p>
<p>By the end of the tourist season, in November, we anticipate being well-known and thriving with the local community - they will be our target membership. This will provide us sustainable growth even as the population decreases to a sleepy winter baseline.</p>

<p>We discovered that Santa Fe is an incredible location for what we offer, and seeking newer ways of inner-balance and awareness. We do very well in our daily community interactions and receive a lot of positive feedback from local business owners for what we are bringing - they are ready for something new and balancing! </p>
<p>The benefits exceed just the local community, however, since the tourist population is a major part of what makes Santa Fe so special. So in truth, we are establishing an oasis of self-growth for an increasingly global community. <strong><i>This is what excites us and encourages us the most!</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The largest risk we run is in not being able to get our presence known widely enough out of the gate. We take a great leap of faith that within the first month we can find sustainability, and that we can offer enough desired classes and services to satisfy the demands...and to not burn ourselves out trying. <strong><i>But isn't that what entrepreneurship is all about?</i></strong></p>
<p>At this stage, we have hit the obvious point in our paths that we have to open our own place. We have all we need to be tremendously successful and to see vast growth right from the beginning, to include faith and guidance. The first steps are daunting for us, but we know that we are here to be of service and to share joy in ways that the world is seeking. We are ready, and we are going all-in with learning from each moment! That is the key to our success as we move forward.</p>
<p><strong>*Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Any donation you can make is going to be appreciated and immediately paid forward to a community larger than any of us as individuals. So you can envision that every dollar you donate is going into a vessel of social health and growth. <i><strong>Truly, that is the bottom line!</strong></i></p>
<p>If you are unable to help, we do know how much you would do so if you could! So we just ask that you share our FB (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Synesthesia-Santa-Fe-1844883759162970/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here</a> to see and like), our InstaGram (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/synesthesia.sf/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>), and this campaign with others! It's that easy!</p>
<p>We are grateful that you've given this due thought, and are looking forward to seeing you in the studio for a class, an energy session, and in general because you are special to us!</p>
</div></div>","*Short Summary:
Allison owned the premier women's fitness/pole dancing studio in Boise, Idaho for several years before we united and began traveling the world in what can be called a spiritual journey. She built her business from the ground up and left it thriving in the hands of former customers-turned-teachers/owners. It was too much a commodity for the community to not continue the business.
Wind had completed massage therapy schooling between Boise, ID, and Sedona, AZ in 2012, in addition to his Reiki education and other Complementary and Alternative Therapies. He set out to the Amazon at the end of 2012 to dive into shamanism, mysticism, and heart-based consciousness. His background of 20 years Navy concluded with a Graduate-level Certificate in Social Entrepreneurship and Non-Profit Management at the University of Minnesota's prestigious Humphrey School of Public Affairs. In 2016 he added Tantric Yoga Teacher Training (RYT 200) to his toolbox. 
Together Wind and Allison have amassed thousands of miles of global travels in the 4 years we've been together, all being a deeply insightful inner journey. The knowledge has always been that in the right timing, we would open our own center to begin giving back to our community the knowledge of self-journey that we've amassed along our cumulative life experiences. And we've learned a lot.
We have a long-standing webpage for our services which saw a 300% increase in business beginning August of 2016. With our recent work at a local healing center, we were given the final tools and boost to recognize that what we have learned has high value in Santa Fe and to the global traveling community.  
*Short term (next 12 months) and long term objectives:
We are going to start immediately with Aerial Silk Yoga, mat yoga, and Energy/Reiki/Massage services. Aerial Silk and even Pole dance have been highly requested from a vast amount of various local population seeking to enhance their movement and empowerment in ways that don't yet exist in the Santa Fe market.
*As July is said to be of the busiest times in Santa Fe, and the location for our business is prime in the downtown area, we expect that even this modest start will hit a huge success immediately. 
By the end of the tourist season, in November, we anticipate being well-known and thriving with the local community - they will be our target membership. This will provide us sustainable growth even as the population decreases to a sleepy winter baseline.
One year from opening we anticipate seeing further expansion into a larger space, or a joint space in the same building, to accommodate what should easily be a busy class and therapy schedule, multiple teachers and therapists, and a full membership base. 
Beyond 12 months will be experimenting with alternative therapies and other classes, and include retreats both locally and abroad. Hosting various teacher trainings for yoga and energy therapies will be expanded, or initiated if they hadn't yet been implemented. The longterm vision is to create a community for local and traveling populations who seek deeper fulfillment and self-understanding, and for those who can help hold this space while aligned with our vision.

<p>I love bookstores. I don’t know many people that don’t: they are comforting, engaging, educational, and unique, spending time in a bookstore always rejuvenates me; just being around the thoughts, the feelings, the words, the ideas, and the imagination of so many it is enthralling, and it is empowering.</p>
<p>I grew up in a small town in the heart of the Texas Hill Country: Boerne, Texas. It’s a unique town, and it is home to a variety of people, and it continues to pull people to it. After college I left home, as many people do, I travelled the United States searching for something or I thought, rather, that I was in search of something, really I was learning how to allow myself to develop and to grow. I lived in Idaho, Utah, New York, and New Mexico, working in bookstores and writing. I moved back to Boerne a couple of years ago after spending four years in Santa Fe, New Mexico—though I have always dreamed of opening a bookstore it was in New Mexico that I began to amuse the idea with a real passion. I started selling books online out of the kitchen of my two bedroom home through abebooks.com, amazon.com, biblio.com, and alibiris.com. Moving back to Boerne I opened my bookstore in beta renting a room in a multi-vendor building on Main Street that I called Wardrobe Books.</p>
<p>I dream of a brick-and-mortar bookstore, tea, and coffeehouse, in a building not far from the river (438 S. Main Street Boerne, Texas 78006), where I’ll sell new, used, remainder, rare, and collectible books, a hybrid business model developed from the bookstore chain Books Inc. of San Francisco and Op. Cit. Books of Santa Fe (where I worked while in New Mexico), we will host author readings and events, various workshops, open-mics, community readings, show TED talks, and work with the local schools and shelters. We will offer a menu of teas from all over the world, not unlike The Teahouse in Santa Fe which is located at the peak of Canyon Road, as well as various coffees. I want to create, to build, and to develop a place for the people of my community to come together.</p>
<p>Boerne, Texas does not have a bookstore, in fact, there are no bookstores within 30 miles of Boerne in any direction. The city has 10 public schools, 4 private, and is considering the merits of a college/university. Boerne is the largest city in the 5<sup>th</sup> fastest growing county (Kendall County) in the United States. I believe whole-heartedly in this bookstore, I have a passion and a love for literature that has only grown, and shadowed me throughout these United States, that drive accompanied by the undeniable market success of a bookstore in Boerne, Texas is a catalyst for amazing things.</p>
<p><i>LiftFund</i> is a designated community development financial institution created to provide credit and services to small businesses, they have agreed to move forward with a loan request to establish CommuniTea Books if we can raise $40,000. I am asking for, and would be forevermore grateful, if you all would support this campaign, to be a part of the initial funding that would inspire, and develop CommuniTea Books. Sincerely, Thank you.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>From inception, Breathing Room has always intended to be a place where you can come and learn to be yourself through the offerings and teachings of yoga. Over the past seven years, not only has Breathing Room served as a space for that individual growth, it has flourished into a community of individuals coming together to learn, play, collaborate and serve the larger good of New Haven and beyond. As we see this growth and dedication to practice and community flourish, we recognize it is time to create more capacity for all that is coming to be . . . and in order to do so, we physically need more square footage!</p>
<p>We are excited to announce that we have found the perfect location for more Breathing Room! 216 Crown Street will be an 8,000 square ft. Yoga and Wellness Center that will accommodate three yoga studios, an in-house Naturopathic doctor’s office, a float center, aerial yoga, co-working space, plus treatment rooms for massage, acupuncture and energy healing. WAHOOOO!</p>

<p>By contributing to this campaign, you will be helping to bring an invaluable source of wellness offerings to our community and beyond, creating more space for additional yoga offerings, trainings, community events and service projects! Just a few of the offerings that will be supported by this new space include:</p>

<li>And of course, our upcoming 300 hour yoga teacher training!</li>
</ul>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The New BRYC project budget is $165,000. With a personal investment and a small business loan, we are looking to raise $40,000, one quarter of the total cost.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe if you are reading this you have experienced first hand the impact of the Breathing Room community on yourself or someone you care for. There truly is something special here and it is not just the walls that we inhabit, it is so much larger. It is the presence of Peace, Assurance, Gratitude and Love that is instilled in us when we choose to truly do the work for positive change in ourselves and the communities we love. It is these values that Breathing Room truly embodies and is built upon. The students, teachers, volunteers, graduates and four- legged beings have and always will be soul of this community.ith this new space, we continue to build upon these core values in great efforts to create positive and important impact in the lives of all seeking that greater connection and higher awareness.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to be working to create a non profit portion of the Breathing Room community that will come to being in the year ahead. This will be a service project geared to support the community by using all the limbs of yoga, not just asana. We will be working with local schools, shelters and service communities to provide wellness and educational opportunities to individuals, families and organizations. The new space will be home to this important new Breathing Room endeavor.</p>
<p>Breathing Room was born from a dream and the contributions of this community. Six years ago, after out-growing  our 1.5 year pop-up in the English Market building, I compiled my then-life’s savings and $8,000 raised from family, friends and yogis to move to the Chapel Street location. Before we did construction, the space was a multi-colored tattoo parlor; I loved the design challenges! When we were finished, it felt like home. The beauty and hominess of that space will only increase with this move. Amazing high ceilings, that will not be removed, will hold space for our main studio that has two fireplaces…. The lobby in and of itself is a masterpiece of art that will house our beloved paintings and cozy benches. We will have more room for storage, cubbies and even a place where you can come kick back, do some reading or studying between classes, appointments and floats!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Like any large construction project, there are always some unknown variables, ‘what will we find behind this wall… underneath this floor, etc…’ For the last several months, I have been working tirelessly with contractors, architects and specialists to understand the scope of work for this project. With many years under my belt working for an architecture firm in project and design management, a lifetime of being the daughter of a builder,  my education in entrepreneurship and small business management and many, many hours of meditation on accepting all that is and coming to be, I feel very peaceful and assured that this project will run smoothly and in record time! All we need is your help to reach our financial goals to help things run even more smoothly!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This is an all hands-on mat project and we totally understand if donating funds is too much of a stretch for some. If that is the case, we have many other ways that you can show your devotion to Breathing Room!</p>
<p>Help us get the word out! Share with others on social media about all the awesome incentives people can receive by donating.</p>
<p>Come help us Paint! We will have multiple call to action painting parties where you can come and serve the community.</p>

It has always been my dream to have my own business, to create a unique space where I not only help people but also give back to the community in which I live.  I’m so excited to introduce the Denver Massage Collective (DMC) to you!  Colorado proudly represents a strong community of local business and the DMC looks to be the premier local massage provider where people can receive excellent service at an excellent price.  At the DMC you’ll receive the quality of a Ritz-Carlton with the convenience and affordability of Massage Envy.
Not only that but a portion of the profits from every massage will be donated to Metro Caring, a non profit focusing on feeding the hungry in Denver.  Your donation no matter how big or small goes directly to buying the supplies that will make my vision a reality.  I am asking for $1500 for the following things :

Sheets
Stool
Towel WarmerBlanket
Sheep Skin Face Cover
Side Table
Accent Chair
Hot Stones
Hot Stone Warmer
Towels
Organic Lotion and Oil
Extension Cord

<p>Our Banquet Hall was originally called
the Petersburg Casino.  It was a dance

at the end of the parking lot and was dragged over and attached to the building

<p>There was a Ladies &amp; Escorts room
which is now called The Tree Room and The Gentlemen’s Room was where the
Vinters Lounge is now.</p>
<p>In the Gentlemen’s room there is a table

to reserve it by name.  It got its name
because local farmers used to come in and talk B.S. and sit at that table. (Did

</div></div>","The #20forYemen Project

Twitter Brought friends together, friends who had either experienced or seen poverty first hand to discuss about the situation in Yemen, the most impoverished country in the Middle East with 90% of their food being imported.With a single intent and single goal, and idea was born. An idea to somehow go around the current Blockade on Yemen and help people who are displaced by war.Armed with relentless passion and the ability to focus on helping others the #20ForYemen project was started on Twitter.The Project SpiritThe basic idea was to collect funds and send them to Yemen to have one of the project members buy food locally and distribute it. This was the only way to beat the blockade which is in place.

This idea has proven to be successful and we have so far managed to feed 300 Internally Displaced Families. Much more needs to be done.

By Giving a simple amount of 20$By giving a simple amount of only 20$ you are helping a whole family for one month! For each 20$ we can buy:





25 kg wheat




5 kg rice




5 kg sugar




2L cooking oil





What has been done so far?In as little as 10 days Twitter responded and we raised $4200 enough to feed almost 150 families. The food has been distributed. (See pictures) Between then and now we have already distributed food to over 500 families, and this Eid we distributed clothes to displaced children so they could celebrate Eid. We believe that in spite of the heavy shelling, we could at least remind them that they are still children. Gods's little angels who don't deserve this life and they are loved!What do you get?What is better than the satisfaction of helping a family in dire need?There are only two ways to live a pleasant life, either in someone’s heart or in someone’s prayer. In this case you get both!We like quotes!The Money You DonateEvery penny we receive from the donors goes to buy food for Internally displaced families As for last time, we bought 149 bags each one contained: 25 Kg wheat, 5 kg sugar, 5 kg rice and 2L of cooking oil. The total price was 845820 YR which is equal to 2500$.Transport costs from Sanaa (Capital of Yemen) to Harf Safyan (The Area where the food was given) costed 62000 YR which is equal to 180$.Wait... What Is Happening to Yemen?Saudi Arabia together with a coalition of nine Arab states, began carrying out in-discriminant airstrikes in Yemen on 25 March 2015 and at the same time a blockade was placed on Yemen so at the moment nothing can go in, not even basic supplies!Some UN stats:According to UNOCHA, this is the latest situation report on Yemen, published 30. June 2015:About UsThe Project founder is Fatik Abdullah Al Rodaini. He is 36 Years Old and he lives in Sanaa, Yemen. Fatik is a Journalist and an Human Rights Activist in Yemen.

Finally there is Hassan Aziz who runs his web design company from Denmark. and has been tirelessly working on Twitter and has been instrumental in designing this page.
These are the friends of Twitter who initially started this project and keep it running. Without the patronage and help of some of our Twitter friends, we wouldn't be able to do what we do.
 Remember: We work in extremely dangerous and volatile conditions everyday, to get much needed food to people, Your donations do go a long way to make this happen. Please give Yemen a chance!

Fatik Al Rodaini's charity fund MONA does all the work on the ground in Yemen.

Cant Donate? That's Okay.. Raise Awareness!
Not everybody can donate, but everybody can make a difference - it doesn't always have to be money, you can raise awareness by using the twitter hashtag: #20foryemen to raise awareness about this campaign. Share it with family and friends and help spread the message!

Last Words

This concept comes to fruition with the aim that every human being should be able to live with dignity without having to worry about the very basic right of sustenance.
Please give generously because the only way to live a pleasant life is either in someone's heart or someone's Prayer. and in this case you get both!",14.0,0,"6 Campaigns
